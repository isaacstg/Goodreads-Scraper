Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, #1)
",Rebecca Yarros,4.57,2232835,30232,"Dragons, Romantasy, Fiction, Audiobook, Fantasy Romance, Magic, New Adult",517,02-05-2023,"Enter the brutal and elite world of a war college for dragon riders...Twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail was supposed to enter the Scribe Quadrant, living a quiet life among books and history. Now, the commanding general—also known as her tough-as-talons mother—has ordered Violet to join the hundreds of candidates striving to become the elite of Navarre:dragon riders.But when you’re smaller than everyone else and your body is brittle, death is only a heartbeat away...because dragons don’t bond to “fragile” humans. They incinerate them.With fewer dragons willing to bond than cadets, most would kill Violet to better their own chances of success. The rest would kill her just for being her mother’s daughter—like Xaden Riorson, the most powerful and ruthless wingleader in the Riders Quadrant.She’ll need every edge her wits can give her just to see the next sunrise.Yet, with every day that passes, the war outside grows more deadly, the kingdom's protective wards are failing, and the death toll continues to rise. Even worse, Violet begins to suspect leadership is hiding a terrible secret.Friends, enemies, lovers. Everyone at Basgiath War College has an agenda—because once you enter, there are only two ways out:graduate or die","[{'rating': 5, 'content': ""#3 Reread - November 2023 - ೃ⁀➷ 5 starsFourth wing(noun) my favourite hello and my hardest goodbye…*#2 Reread - August 2023 - ೃ⁀➷ 5+ stars. . . Mrs Yarros, hmu if u run out of creative ways to carry out dainty boys death trope, I’ve got some amazing ideas. I’ll do u and everyone proud <333Also everything from my first review still stands 😌👑Also pt.2, yes. . . Yes, the ending still hurtWORSEthe second time around 🥰🥰🔫🔫─── ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ ──#𝟭 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗱 - 𝗠𝗮𝘆 𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟯 - ೃ⁀➷ 𝟱 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘀TO ANYONE LISTENING YOU NEED TO GO INTO THIS BOOK AS BLIND AS POSSIBLE I PROMISE ITS GONNA ENHANCE THE EXPERIENCE TENFOLD. ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW IS THAT THIS WILL BE YOUR NEW FAV BOOK FOREVER <3But for everyone else who needs to know…Here’s a quick rundown of the book:it’s about the daughter of a high-ranked general, Violet, getting ordered into learning how to become a dragon rider (but she doesn’t initially want to bc all she’s known are books her entire life) and so she commits to basgiath War collage where she goes through trials designed to root out the weak. She has to figure out how to best everyone and weaponise her strengths. While navigating her feelings for a certain forbidden boi. There’s romance AND (back arching) spice with sparks and tension galore. Also for everyone wondering, the ending isn’t that bad. It’s more of a promising cliffhanger. Makes you feel hopeful rather than making you want to crash and burn everything in your line of sight lmao.*I’m sorry in advance bc this review is gonna be gigantisaourus*wags brows* do you see what I did there?It’s been ages since I’ve loved all the MCs in a book so I deserve to go crazy on the fangirling, leave me alone 🙏This book. THIS BOOK- It gives you EVERYTHING you crave in romantasy. The drama, the characters, the plot, the action, the betrayal, the romance, the tension, THE HOPE THAT THERE ARE STILL AMAZING BOOKS OUT THERE IN THE WORLD-AND IT JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER-There is not a single dry page. Not one. It constantly stimulates your imagination. And there aren’t the usual boring unnecessary bs conversations happening, they’re almost always full of banter and in every chapter, something is happening. It’s fast-paced and that’s something I ADORE about this book.BUT CAN WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE FUCKING TENSION PLS??The addictive chemistry between XadenVi will chew you up, eat you alive and then shit you out, effectively altering the composition of your DNA forevermore😩❤️\u200d🩹The dialogue in this book is so yummy istg I was always giggling and kicking my feet whenever the MCs would interact 🤭💗🦋 they’re both sarcastic funny smart and complement each other sm. I’m telling you this book never left me wanting for anything. There was never a time when I was like ugh the MCs hardly interact or wtv. There’s a perfect amount of every aspect in this book, I’ll never be able to get over it.While reading, it leaves you feeling as though you’ve lost a limb whenever you have to remove yourself from the book to carry out the most trivial inconvenience like feeding and hydrating yourself 😤🔪I'm telling you this book is the only sustenance I need to keep me alive 🙏Violet is me. I am Violet. We are one.No bc she is the most relatable character I’ve read in a long ass time. The way she is so reasonable, empathetic and HAS INTEGRITY. She’s not a pushover. She knows her mind and isn’t afraid to speak it when she feels the need to. There’s no ‘my body is betraying me’ bullshit. Not in this house. I’m in LOVE with violet sfmmm. She owns her feelings and demands what she’s owed. And when Xaden challenges her but she takes it as an incentive to poke and tease him back tenfold is ✨💗🦋🤌Watching her grow and become stronger was one of the most satisfying things about this book. Her character development was elite. She never changed her morals but she always adapts and moves on quickly and I cannot stress enough hm I love that about her.There wasn’t a single moment where I was annoyed at her for being hardheaded. She’s strategic but also carefree. She behaved like a normal 20-year-old would, not older/younger.XADEN is such a seductive menace but he’s MY precious seductive menace.He's always up for a challenge and he SERVES every freaking time. I love everything he has to say. He’s such a lil softy when it comes down to it. Him showing his love through his actions and constantly challenging Vi to do better??It’s the way he never coddles her but also shaves years off his life, worrying about her safety for me 🥹💗🙏😩🦋💞✨🧸I’m always waiting on hands and feet for any interaction with him whether it be his glares 🤭theirnot so shortglances across the classroom 💞his sarcastic quips 💅him being a brooding surly grump😩him being lethally calm 👑him obsessed with her every move 🙏💗Him telling her not to look at him like that bc he only has sm restraint??🤌❤️\u200d🔥 (I have to note that Lance did it better sksksksk) BUT EVERYTHING HE DOES IS HOT PLS-The way I fell for him the first moment he was described?? Everyone is saying how he’s like this guy or that guy from this book and that and I’m just here like idc if he was an amalgamation of every MMC I love?? I DONT CARE BECAUSEIT MADE ME LOVE HIM EVEN MORE👏 I respect Rebecca for plucking the best traits of every fantasy MMC, like don’t be shy put some more 💀✋And there are the dragons but all you need to know is that each one has their personality. They rule themselves. They're the real legends here. And the way this author has weaved them into the book is just MWAH *chefs kiss*The found family in this book is the most precious thing ever.I loved to read how they’re bonded together and I can see that each relationship has the potential to grow into something really special ugh I cannot wait for the next books 😩OkaySPOILERS ahead!!bc your girl gotta scream <33---When Tairn came out of wherever tf he was hiding I was screaming and legit shaking from the adrenaline. I’m still having a hard time accepting how good this book is! I thought she would only get Andarna and I was kinda disappointed bc the moment Tairn got mentioned in that lesson I JUMPED ON THE IDEA OF HIM SO FAST YOU DONT UNDERSTAND. But when he came to save her and Goldie AND THEN SPOKE TO HER IN HER MIND?? I BROKE DOWN AND HOWLED. SO. FUCKING. LOUD.And then Andarna was like “TELL HER MY NAME AS WELL” and I’m- *passes out from yelling so much*I LOVE ANDARNA SFMMM SHES THE MOST ADORABLE CUTE LITTLE SUNSHINE IVE EVER HAD THE PLEASURE TO READ ABOUT 🥹🫂💗😫💞🧸 The light of my life I’m telling you. she must be protected at all costs. (But omg at the end Xaden was like Goldie’s gone huge and I’m here like oop- I NEED TO SEE HER RFN)I love how Tairn is a dad adjacent to Violet 🙏 he’s my grumpiest overprotective pookie 🤭💗with STRONG feelings for his mate skskdhjd (I’m kinda jelly of Sgaeyl ngl)ALSO HOW FUCKING DARE YOU REBECCA!! You ripped my heart out of my chest, gave it a thousand paper cuts and flung it into a volcano for good measure. Liam's death BROKE me🔪 I cried too many fat ugly tears 😭 it was unbearable *shaky breath* but when XADEN found out and cried the cry of all cries?!? Me: (;´༎ຶٹ༎ຶ`) X 100And the fact that her brother is alive made me do a lap around my garden from sheer satisfaction bc I WAS FUCKING RIGHT. 15% in I guessed that he would be alive but he’ll be part of the “wrong” side of the war and it’s been kept a secret bc of the shame/treason and AHHH *does cheerleader flip and cartwheel*And Dain?? That pussy ass lil BITCHHHH- I wasn’t born with enough middle fingers to let you know hm I feel about him. He’s basically Adam from shatter me, and fml bc my reread is just gonna be me wanting to rip his spine out and strangling him w it whenever he speaks 😃🔫But when that inntinnsic called his every thought out to the crowd it was the most hilarious shit ever pls 💀 he’s so pathetic.SPOILERS OVEROne thing I have to say is that this book is not perfect. The action aspect of the book gets a LOT better towards the end imo but the start was a little rusty and needed some finesse but idc idc I’ll take it, faults and all. After all, I’m a character development lover so I can overlook it.BUT THE WORLD BUILDING IS- ヽ(♡‿♡)ノOml the way this author writes leaves you ON THE EDGE WHITE KNUCKLING YOUR SEAT GASPING SHAKING SCREAMING bc you have no idea what will happen next.IT'S THE BIGGEST FLEX TO NOT ONLY OUTDO THE OGS BUT TO EXCEL PHENOMENALLYYYYY AT IT AS WELL 💅✨REBECCA YAROS YOU ARE AN ICON BC I GOBBLED UP EVERY SCENE EVERY CHAPTER EVERY WORD.𝗦𝗶𝗱𝗲 𝗻𝗼𝘁𝗲:I think it’s become my favourite fantasy book ever.

Not once did it feel boring or like I should just skim something, and for once, I know the hype was so worth it! 😩• Spoilers ahead — and I seriously want y\'all to enjoy this book without spoilersThis book is the perfect blend of Fantasy-Romance because it had the spiciest romance scenes with lots of sexual tension and enough twists that will keep you awake the whole night.*Dark circles forming, but anything for XadenVi.*❝The weak don’t survive here, especially not in the Riders Quadrant. The dragons make sure of that.❞In the beginning, Karen aka General Sorrengail, forces Violet to join Rider\'s Quadrant, a place where people become riders and form bonds with dragons.This is in contrast to Violet\'s original plan of following her father\'s path and becoming a scribe, responsible for documenting history. This makes her feeling angry and fearful because the decision is up to her mother, and she has no choice but to agree. She wasn\'t mentally or physically prepared for this challenge and have to do anything to survive.╰┈➤ VIOLET SORRENGAIL AKA VIOLENCE:❝You look all frail and breakable, but you’re really a violent little thing, aren’t you?❞Despite dealing with a chronic illness (ehler\'s danlos syndrome) and having weak joints, she was incredibly awesome and strong! Her personality was so relatable that I felt connected right away.Her anxieties and fears during challenges in the rider\'s quadrant, and how she conquered them with her smarts, were truly inspiring. She showed that knowledge is real power! Her rollercoaster of emotions—fear, anger, desire, happiness—kept me amazed.Even when teased and called weak, she never let anyone walk all over her. And fr, I didn\'t even get that \'oh I\'m so tiny and frail\' or the \'pick me vibes\' as mentioned somewhere because she actually had a illness.I would\'ve dashed for the hills (or the scribe quadrant in Violet\'s situation) when every single cadet was dead set on killing me!It was like half luck, and 25% thanks to the dragon scale corset, and another 25% to Violet\'s intelligence that kept her alive!And - wait XADEN PROTECTED HER WELL TOO! 🤭❝What I lack in strength, I make up for in speed.❞— She kept training and had a lot of improvement and her skills with the daggers were impeccable! landing straight on the target.╰┈➤ XADEN RIORSON:❝Stay the hell away from Xaden Riorson.❞Fantasy men are just FINE AF! From the beginning, he exudes a mysterious aura. Despite the stern lines on his face and a SCAR ON HIS LEFT BROW 🥵, he exudes both danger and allure.His character captivates me so deeply that even if I hadn\'t known he was the mmc, I would have rooted for him.fuck Dain.Xaden comes across as grumpy and ruthless, concealing his emotions behind a stoic facade.However, his interactions with Violet reveal a thoughtful, kind, and trusting side that filled me with so many emotions. It\'s this side of him that I adore. 💞He holds the position of the wing leader of FOURTH WING with great authority. His intelligence and power are remarkable, and don\'t even get me started on the way he walks, talks, and smirks – it leaves me utterly on my knees for him!🧎\u200d♀️His character possesses incredible depth, and I would\'ve loved to have his POV.He\'s a shadow wielder, and just by imagining the shadows around him, his rebellion relic, and his scar — I feel something inside of me! 😮\u200d💨REBECCA ADDED EVERY QUALITY TO MAKE HIM THE HOTTEST CHARACTER! 🤭— Ruthless who? He\'s such a softie....🔪 gave Violet training for sparring matches.🔪 made a saddle for her to be seated on her dragon.🔪 made a custom dagger for her.🔪 killed a room full of cadets who tried to kill Violet, just by using his shadows.🔪 took care of her when she was hurt.🔪 punished a wing leader who tried to kill Violet.╰┈➤ DRAGONS:—So the most sarcasticpersoncreature award goes to TAIRN!🫡God, how much I loved this grumpy broody dragon! He was one of the deadliest and strongest dragons, and he was bonded with none other than Violet! 🤭 His remarks were so sarcastic and savage, and the way he always scoffed and knew about her feelings for Xaden. Hehehe, and he also adores Sgaeyl sm!If he were actually a human, he\'d be so grumpy and possessive, I\'M TELLING YA\'LL! 😂💕❝And to think, I’d almost forgotten just how loquacious humans are.❞Andarna:This cutie goldie dragon—OMF, she was such a cutie! I loved how optimistic and innocent she actually was and possessed great powers, but she was only 2 years old! And the fact that she\'s also bonded with Violet 🥺Sgaeyl:We didn\'t get much about her, though hopefully in the next book, but I\'m so glad she and Tairn are bonded mates! GOD SHE HAS A BRILLIANT TASTE IN MEN. 🥵— ENEMIES TO LOVERS WHERE HE WANTS TO KILL HER? *Sign me up*❝He’s a third-year, and he will kill you the second he finds out who you are.❞Xaden is the son of Fen Riorson, known as THE GREATEST TRAITOR due to his leadership in a rebellion group. Sadly, this resulted in the execution of all rebel group members in front of their children, who were then marked with a relic symbolizing the rebellion.These children were forcibly placed into the Rider\'s Quadrant, where they faced the challenge of survival. The overseeing figure during these executions was none other than General Sorrengail (Violet\'s mother),so they\'re enemies, and he\'s the one who\'s gonnakillhandle her.🤭The enemies-to-lovers approach in this book was really well done.It felt very realistic and stayed true to the idea that \'children shouldn\'t be punished for their parents\' mistakes.\' The kids marked by the relic understood this, and Violet did too. What I especially liked was how Xaden and Violet\'s relationship grew naturally without being burdened by guilt from their pasts.Even though they weren\'t enemies for very long, the book didn\'t rush their journey to becoming lovers. Instead, it skillfully portrayed the gradual development of trust, as well as their decision to let go of their desires, leading them to eventually fall in love. ♥️Violet was super confused by Xaden\'s behavior. Rather than harming her, he encouraged her and saw her potential. He treated her as strong, not fragile, which both confused and intrigued her. 😉❝Going for blood today, are we, Violence?❞After Threshing (where the cadets were bonded with dragons), Violet discovered that Tairn, her dragon, was actually the bonded mate of Sgaeyl, Xaden\'s dragon. This connection tied the four of them together, and if one of them died, they all would. This meant Xaden couldn\'t consider killing her anymore, (not that he had intended to in the first place.) 🥹THE SEXUAL TENSION WAS TENSIONING.🥵 The sexual tension between them was incredibly strong! The heated lust-filled stares, locking eyes, proximity on mats, and more, yet neither wanted to act on it. Their first kiss was incredibly passionate and I was so giddy at that time. There were 3 graphic scenes but Damn they were HOT AF! 🫣🔥❝I am annoyingly aware of everything you do.❞NOT THEM SHATTERING WINDOWS, BREAKING ARMOIRES AND CHAIRS, BURNING CURTAINS AND FORESTS WHILE DOING ✨IT✨.╰┈➤ SIDE CHARACTERS:Rhiannon and Rodic:They were literal babies and I loved how both of them supported Violet! Idk when and how Rodic made his place in my heart but he was so cute. Always adopting humor for every situation and was so calm hehe! 🥺 Am I the only one who wants them together?Like who Tara, Sawyer, or whatever his name is, just give Rhi and Rodic.Sawyer, Imogen, Bodhi, Garrick, Emery, Heaton:I loved how they all became a squad and clearly I would love more of them!Mira Sorrengail:This badass cutie, sexy hot, I love her! 🥵 She\'s so fierce and the best sister ever! 💞Liam Mairi:WE WERE ROBBED OF HIM. I WILL NEVER EVER FORGET HIM, please he was so precious. 🥺😭 I literally cried so much when he died! I already had a feeling that he might die, but god it was so painful. I was so badly hurt when he died. It was so painful to see him dying and then Xaden calling him Brother. My heart broke! I\'m never forgetting that piece of shit Dain.Dain Aetos:This bitch, this traitor, this asshole, what the fuck! Why did he have to go and pull a full traitor-Adam-Kent behavior like bitch fuck off??I actually reasoned with him in the start and ignored him because he was just there to discourage Violet and gaslight her again and again by using \'best friend\' but he so skillfully and fucked-uply betrayed her.IF HE DIDN\'T READ VIOLET\'S MEMORIES (by touching her face) and then not telling his father, LIAM WOULD BE FUCKING ALIVE. FUCK OFF, DAINNN. I WISH YOU GET SCORCHED BY TAIRN! 🤢❝Stop. Fucking. Coddling. Her.❞— yeah, bitch, get that!Jack Barlowe:He was a piece of shit just like Dain and I\'m glad he was Violet\'s first kill, haha served him right! I don\'t want to give him more importance; he was shit AF! His death was so satisfying 😗🤝🏻Long-haired Luca and Traitor Tynan getting scorched was the best thing.General Sorrengail:I dislike her already and I know I\'ll loathe her in the next books, but the only good thing was she trusted that Violet is capable of becoming a rider.Syrena (Flier):She\'s a gryphon rider and had only 2 scenes, but I wish we get to see her in the next books!— some other things:1. I literally choked on my laugh when I read about how smartly Violet won all the sparring matches because she poisoned every player with different types of herbs during the match, and her choosing the breakfast duties to add the poisons in their lunch was such a badass move!It\'s truly proven by Violet that knowledge is power.2. When Dylan died, my heart just stopped for a moment, and I was so horrified when Aurelie died! (Guess I\'m just going to grieve for Liam baby now.)3.All the challenges gave me Squid Game vibes, like all those tasks just to survive and so many deaths each day!Ugh, It was so fun yet horrifying to read. 🤧4.""Fuck, that stubborn, feisty look always makes me want to kiss you.”— these beautiful words!!?? 🤭5. I seriously don\'t even understand how Violet blocked the pain out and got so many stitches every month! I\'d already be on my deathbed 😂6. Am I the only one who couldn\'t — even after reading 3 times — imagine the GAUNTLET scene???? like WTH WAS THAT 😭7.MY TOXIC TRAIT IS THAT I THINK I WOULD\'VE KILLED THE VENIN IF I WERE IN VIOLET\'S PLACE (wth? 💀💀)8. I had doubts about Venins and Wyvern from the start, and gosh, they were horrifying AF!If we want anything to be real, IT\'S FICTIONAL MEN, not these ew!9. GOD, THE END? I\'m still shocked 🥲whjwhsha, I love this book! Ayyayayayaya 🥺 TO MY READING SLUMP.... here I come!!!⤷Ratings.𖥔 ݁ ˖• Fourth Wing — 5 stars• Iron Flame– 3.75 stars• Onyx Storm– tbr'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Edit: for those who do not read the whole review but still feel they are entitled to leave a comment. This is a long review1- it dissects a lot in the book, if this is not a clue for you that there are spoilers then maybe check your IQ.2- For those who are saying ""make it short"" you know you could scrol by and not read right? just take your own advice especially if you love this book and move along to the millions of 5 star reviews3- STOP SAYING NOTHING IS ORIGINAL..I can slap you with at least 20 books written in 2923/2024 that has more originality than this book! We are not asking for a Tolkein level of originality, but if you cannot even come up with your own character description and had to take the literal description from other books (among others) then why are you even called an author?4- in a world that is coming soon to be drowned with AI movies and clips and pictures, I do not want to read an AI book. and I do not mean that the author used AI (Although at this point no one knows), I mean the copy, paste, and stitch from other booksother than that, knock yourself outThe sad reality is this book will probably be GR best fantasy of 2023 though it has NOTHING of the fantasy elementsIf I wanted to read cheap immitation of every other fantasy book then this book it is 😡😡😡😡every time I have an atom of hope that there is something 0.0000001% original, someone casually points out that it\'s not!IMPORTANT NOTE FOR READERS AT THE ENDIs this the future of books? writers shamelessly taking others\' work without even bringing their own to the table and the unknowing masses cheering them on!by now, this has become a game of ""SPOT THE COMMON, AND FIND THE DIFFERENCE""this book does not deserve an ounce of respect and this came after confirming that even the main characters\' descriptions are literally takenPLEASE STOP SAYING THAT NOTHING IS ORIGINAL ANYMORE! YEAH? PROVE ITAND EVEN IF THIS IS TRUE, IF A WRITER FAILS TO BRING AT LEAST 20% ORGININALITY ONTO THEIR BOOK, DO THEY DESERVE TO BE CALLED WRITERS???It is one thing to sample an idea or concept from ""a book"", it is another to take the whole storyline and plot from ""a book"" or in this case ""books"" and make it your own.This book is a memory quiltMade from old stuff to look newIt takes everything that we know as familiar, comfort and nostalgic and weave it together to present it as something new giving you a FAKE sense of enjoymentLet\'s imagine that I am a new reader or someone who never reads fantasy or someone who hasn\'tread and loved the other books mentioned down 👇🏻 I would have absolutely adored this book and considered it one of the best Adult fantasy this year because I knew nothing of them.And surprise surprise! This is what is happeningbut ignorance is not an excuse!Just because you haven\'t read it does not mean it is OK for this book to copy everything!starting this book, I liked that the characters were older than 18. As much as I enjoy YA, sometimes the age just throws me off! However, they still acted like a bunch of 16 and 17 yr.the lingo itself was so cringeimage:I read many YA characters more mature than the main characters in this bookread Ageless and Warda\'s one 1 star review of this book to understand where these characters went wrongThis book attempted to give us a badass female lead that understands that she is flawed, and recognizes her physical incompetence, but does not give a shit. She knows her worth and trusts her intelligence to be her biggest asset so she uses it to get what she wants. She is unapologetic. She knows that if she can’t be cunning, it\'s her life on the line. “I’ll never get over how quickly people move on around here, how callously death is swept under a rug and trampled on minutes later”but, personally, this failed. Because Violet was the typical ""I am weak in the body but somehow I can wip all your asses and accomplish anything"". She is supposed to have a sort of chronic pain that renders her in the disabled category. This is not said out loud in the book. You have to guess it yourself if you are not familiar with the symptoms or learn it from social media. So, it was a role-eye for me seeing her winning every challenge by cheating (which I accepted at first because she was disadvantaged) but then we get no information on how she trained and made herself stronger!. so what was the point of giving her a disability if we cannot see how she overcame it? Also, It was annoying at times seeing Violet practically throwing herself at Xaden like “Pick me, choose me, love me, fuck me”. Girl! Have some dignity. But who can blame her, X is hot and has""Shadow hands, iykyk.... looking at you ACOTAR and ToG fans""and let’s not forget the dragons! I mean who doesn’t love dragons? Throw in dragons with personalities who can hold a conversation and you get yourself a winnerBut these bastards decided with their ever Holly wisdom that a person with a mental disorder (look up Aboulomania) or with a bit of a bitchy attitude is weak and should be scorched to deathI am not going to touch on the characters more than that. Others have explained in detailed reviews the problems with the main leads.And the world building? Excuse me! What world building! If you can answer one question that\'s been nagging me (from the book, not theories) then I\'ll shut up about itA dragon without its rider is a tragedy.\xa0A rider without their dragon is dead.Why? Why is it this way?However, there is abig issuethat is nagging at me and making feel like I am sitting on the most comfortable sofa in the world but someone has put a cushion full of needles at my back. Every time I get a little bit relaxed, a needle pricks my spine or neck or back arm.THIS BOOK HAS NOTHING ORIGINAL AND I DARE ANYONE TO PROVE OTHERWISEWhat this book did is take several old famous ideas from other books and movies, weave it together, and the author simply tailored them with spray edges and a catching cover for bait to come up with a supposedly new book that would please young readers mostly. to quote my friend: ""This book scratches an itchand boy! did this strategy work!This did not sit well with me because :One: the author did not just take from one or two books, she took from several.Two: these ideas were not just inspiration or sampling, in many parts were almost literalThree: copying and sampling are OK as long as the book brings it\'s own added plot or storyline which in this case, Fourth Wing did notWhen I was annotating this book, I marked each time I found an almost literal resemblance to other books. (yellow marks the number)So lets begin (and I am keeping the best or worst to last)Let me begin with the main characters descriptionNo, this is not Violet Sorringale. This is Mare Barrow from Red Queen series. Brown and silver hair and lightning powerAnd the whole ""assumed dead brother who is resurrected and turns out he joined the rebellion""YeahIt\'s like FW has this weird fixation on this seriesbut Violet braids her hair you say! you know who else has silver braided hair and dragons?and how about this one?no this is not Xaden Riorsonthis is either the tall dark and all powerful Rhysand and his Shadow power (and Rhys sacrificed himself for his people, Xaden did as well)or the tall dark and handsome Dorian and his shadow handsBut Xaden has a scar on his face, near his eye more precisely! You know who else tall dark and handsome with an eye scar and rhymes with Xaden!Meadows baby! Our last name is MeadowsNo!? OK, here\'s another tall dark and handsome with scars and is always surrounded by showdows and his name starts with Az and ends with ""are you for real?!""Now, here\'s a trivia for youLet\'s count the number of books where if the guy has Shadow powers the girl gets a control over lighteningJust off the top of my headRed QueenShadow and BonesThe Shadow of Lightening .. etc.Now the plotline1-\tHarry Potter: not talking about magic systems and dragons because many books have those, but “the cadets are thrown into “four wings” upon their arrival, they have to study and compete by gaining “points” and showing skills both physically and mentally.. The literal taking was from p 313 when there is a“tournament”where they had to“retrieve a stolen treasure”to“earn 60 points”2-\tDivergent: I knew that this book was marketed as a combination of Divergent meets Game of Thrones I think, but it took the inspiration too far. I don’t want to read a cheap imitation of Divergent which this book had. The cadets are distributed into quadrants (factions). Violet ends up in the Riders (Dauntless) quadrant where if you show any sign of weakness you are either killed by a fellow cadet or scorched by a dragon!And the Tris/Four moment between Violet and Xaden is also hard to miss. She has a parent/sibling issue, he has a daddy issue. She fantasizes about him all the time (which is nauseating and untasteful at times). Him beating her ass and showing her that he hates her and maybe wants to kill her then ending up saving her life and training her. Even the knife-throwing scene was taken. And it goes on and on3-\tThe Hunger Games: this whole book was the Hunger Games – Dragon Edition. The cadets are literally allowed to kill each other even under the watchful eyes of their superiors. But that is not surprising when the professors so simply snap a cadet’s neck infront of others. I guess “the odds are always stacked against them” yep! This was in the book!And since they are at war and need soldiers, what better way to show how desperate they are than killing off their cadets, instead of sending them off to the other houses 🙄🙄4-\tShatter me/ACOTAR: What are these two series famous for? You guessed it. The predictable love triangle where the first love interest turns out to be a douche and the heroine ends up falling for the dark morally grey character. This is really starting to sound repetitive and obvious.5-\tThrone of Glass (Empire of Storms): Dorian Havilliard has Phantom hands and Xaden has Shadow hands! Both can lift and hold anything with these “hands” and use them during intimate moments. In the beach scene, Aelin and Rowan’s passion fuses their power together and lose control. Same with Vi and X6-\tMulan: (yep! The animation) Mulan shows her strength and proves herself to her camp by using her wit to climb the pole using the weights instead of carrying them to retrieve the arrow and later they use their belts to climb the columns of the palace. The same move Violet uses by planting the rope around the shaft to climb it.7-\tHow to train your dragon: from the description of the dragons, to the lowering of the eyes when meeting one, to the Hiccup and Toothless moment, and the big scarry dragon and the small golden cute one, you cant help noticing these similarities when reading this bookBUT HERE ARE THE MOST OBVIOUS COPY CAT ISSUES8- The plot conflict of the book is the same as Game of ThronesSo instead of the seven kingdoms, Navarre is divided into six but with the province in the east makes it seven! To protect itself, Navarre has built a WARD (wall) around its borders to stop an enemy that we later learn about. This enemy is ruled by a Sage (night king) who creates these venin, monsters that are destroyed only by a special material (valerian steel) which the cadets are forging into blades!people inside the kingdom think that those creatures are just folklore. Venins have the ability to make dragon-like creatures, wyverns, that can breathe BLUE FIRE and dies immediately if their creator diesimage:And the h that has the baddest dragon has silver hair which is always in a braid🙄and thought at first to be fragile and weak!9- Dragon Riders of Pern and Eragon (edited,) I originally related it to Eragon but many friends pointed out that the whole concept of dragon riders bonding with the chosen dragon and that such a dragon can mentally communicate with its rider through witty conversations and big personality is from the mother of all Dragon stories - the Dragonriders of Pern by Anne McCafferyEven the scene where V and X feel horney bec of the Dragon lust is definitely not original to The Fourth Wing10- Dragon School: Just when you think that having Voilet be a Female main lead with a disability is something original of this book, you find out it is not! Dragon School is an acclaimed YA book series by K.L Wilson published in 2017 about sixteen-year-old Amel who joins the Dominion Dragon Riders. But Amel has not only a crippled leg but also chronic disease and Dragon School training is grueling. Before she can even become an initiate, she must complete her First Flight on a dragon. Everyone around Amel thinks she will die before her first ride because of her fragile state and disability. SOUNDS FAMILIAR?Bonus courtesy of @Soyas.ReadingpalaceThis is the map of the Fourth WingThis is the map of the Witcher booksnotice anything?so, there is nothing original about this bookYou want to take the characters\' descriptions? fineoh, you want to take also the plot conflict? finewhat? you want also all the famous plotlines?BUTWhat are you bringing to the table then?????Another side issue that bugged me which was the queer representation. What representation??? I didn’t see any! A representation is when you have a character or a couple of them who are queer. This book made it out as if everyone is Bi and that it is natural for everyone to jump into bed from man to woman. If this is everyone, then this is the norm of the society in the book and there is no representation.I think that this book would be enjoyed by a person who hasn’t read the above-mentioned books or doesn’t want to read them so you get to read a mash-up of them.

She should stay away from him, but a fire burns between these two that is bound to consume them both. \u2060\u2060With stakes this high, every day could be her last.

Mark my words, this is the next big romantasy series!The writing is easy to digest, the world-building is fascinating, the heroine is an underdog and total badass, and the romance develops at a believable pace and is scorching! I laughed. I cried. And I fell in love. This book will forever live in my head rent-free! \u2060Violet Sorrengail is a secret badass!I LOVE her!!!!! She’s a twenty-year-old bookworm who’s expected to live a life as a scribe but now must survive and become a dragon rider. Physically, she’s smaller and frailer than the other cadets in the quadrant, but that doesn’t make her weak. Her mind is her strength and what she needs to survive. I love how Violet handles her situation with courage and grace and how she creates meaningful relationships at the risk of her own heart. She’s extremely relatable, and I can’t wait to see how she grows.Xaden Riorson...this man has easily become one of my top book boyfriends of all time!The son of a traitor, he’s out for revenge against Violet, whose mother led to his father\'s death. From a distance, he’s a scary, scarred, intense anti-hero, but deep down, he’s a man who is loyal, caring, and wise. And the way this man obsesses with Violet….damn. You truly don’t know if he wants to kill or f*ck her, probably both, but yeah, it’s hot! The things I would let this man do to me. 🥵The enemies-to-lovers romance was perfect, with an intense slow burn and eventually spice!I appreciated the time it took for these two to finally get together. And when they finally do, it’s explosive! Thank goodness this is new adult fantasy because the things Xaden says and did go straight to my core, lol.The dragons stole my heart.I don’t want to say too much because it would spoil some of the books, but they are terrifying and amazing!!! They have their own hierarchy and politics, which we don’t see much of since they’re very secretive, but it’s fascinating how they decide to bond with humans to create a symbiotic relationship that ultimately helps protect the land. Can\'t wait to learn more about them in the next book!The found family aspect was done so well!As a dragon rider, you\'re encouraged not to form strong attachments since most people in your school will either die before becoming riders or later on during battle. But Violet goes against this and finds her ride or dies - specifically Rhiannon and Liam! 💕The world building so easy to understand yet very interesting.I’ve never actually read a series focused on dragons and dragon riders, so this was new and exciting for me! It was so interesting learning about the different quadrants - scribe, rider, healer, and infantry - and the schooling required for each. Obviously, this story focuses more on the Riders Quadrant, which honestly is the most exciting because it\'s so intense, challenging, and cutthroat. I personally don’t know if I’d survive, but maybe if I had a friend like Violet, it would be possible!PS: For all you Manon and Abraxos fans out there, you’re going to fall in love with this world!!!For the most part, the story was a bit predictable, but it’s all done in a way that I was entertained and excited to keep reading!I mean, we\'ve seen similar stories where the seemingly weak heroine finds herself in a kill-or-be-killed situation and has to learn to fight and ultimately ends up thriving. So in that regard, you can guess where the story is heading.HOWEVER . . .That ENDING was everything I was not expecting!Those last 50 pages were absolutely epic and blew my fucking mind!!!!!! I DID NOT see that ending coming! I cried and then was left stunned by that last sentence. It\'s a cliffhanger, but it\'ll leave you more in shock instead of in pain, so don\'t be afraid of it! It\'s brutal and will make you want to immediately pick up the next book. Luckily we don\'t have to wait for long since the release date is November 7, 2023!But with everything I love, there are a few things I didn\'t like . . .Sometimes, the wording Violet used to concerning Xaden was a bit repetitive and immature.She kept describing him as beautiful and hot anytime he crossed her mind or showed up. I wish she would have used other words from time to time.The reader has to essentially piece together why Xaden falls for Violet.It’s quickly explained later in the story, but by then, it felt like we were being told more than shown. I would have liked for him to verbalize it more during the story. At least, more than him just saying things like “I can’t stay away from you”or “you’ll be the f*cking death of me”. Every time he\'s say those things, I was like, tell me why, though!Overall, Fourth Wing is an epic story that you will devour! I wouldn’t say this is a perfect 5-star read, maybe it’s closer to 4.5 since it wasn’t ‘perfect’, but honestly, I don\'t care. I haven’t read a fantasy I felt this way about in a long time, so I\'m giving it all the stars.Thank you, Entangled Publishing, for sending me an arc copy in exchange for a review.

I can\'t humanely comprehend how this has a higher rating than Six of Crows. I just can\'t. Here are the things I agree with that everyone has been saying:Good idea,fucking awful, god awful execution.And a little bit of a Shadow and Bone rip off if you ask me.She is supposed to be a scribe. She is forced to become a rider, she gets there, her childhood best friends who has always had feelings for her is mad that she is there, and worried that she won\'t survive. But don\'t worry, because theSHADOW WIELDERbad boy who hates her is there to train her and teach her all about that world. Oh and by the end she ends up being aLIGHTENING WIELDER. There hasn\'t been one in centuries.May the sun summoner bless you Fourth Wing, you\'re about to getroasted.Let\'s get the disability rep talk out of the way, many people told me there was some. And even if there is, the author approached the subject so so so subtlely I honestly couldn\'t even tell it was there. Because the only thing that was actually written was:I am so tiny, I am so weak, I am so fragile, frail, I will crumble. Please, don\'t send me to the dragon riding academy, because I am ramen noodle and I will break and die. Have I also mentioned I am white, pale, and very very very very thin? By the way, I am tiny. I am so smoll. I can\'t even jump on the dragon\'s back I am so small.How will she ever survive?I feel like for people who don’t know that specific disability, she doesn’t give you any insight? Like what does it mean? How does it happen? What is it called? As someone who had never heard of it before it was hard to even notice when she was talking about the disability. It didn’t bring any kind of awareness (which I’d think would be the whole point)Also someone who is this breakable can’t be having wild fucking sex but apparently we forgot about her disability during the sex scenes lmao.But it doesn’t matter because no matter what, everyone wanted to kill her and THERE WAS NO WAY SHE WOULD EVER SURVIVEIn this place where apparently people die daily, like flies. So much danger, so much death, so much struggle. That you don\'t see. You just hear about it because the author got too lazy to actually do any world building. So for the first half of the book there is just a bunch of telling and no showing.But don\'t worry, this frail, little pale, white girl, with white hair will bond not ONE BUT TWO of the rarest most powerful dragons alive. Even if she\'s not even tall enough to jump on their back.Also, enemies to lovers? Where? Where the fuck was that? These two have less chemistry than a priest with a hooker. Her mom is responsible for the death of someone in his family, so he blames her, he wants to kill her, he hates her from the momen the sees her (it lasts about two pages). But every time SHE SEES him, all she can think of is:""He\'s a shark and everyone next to him is a fish"", Dammit I don\'t want to find this asshole hot, but he\'s so hot"", "" ""omg, he calls me violence intead of violet, I am not attracted to toxic men but why do I want to bounce on his dick sooooooooooo bad...""So she basically sounds like a 14 year old valley girl for the entire book.They barely have any significant encounters, all of their interactions are so cringe that it makes me think this book should have been published in 2001. He smells like citrus, he has 107 scars on his back. And he tells her she\'s going to be the death of him every time he gets a chance.""He\'s a very dangerous addiction. Something women will kill for. ""If you catch me killing for men, please, end me first.Anyways, of course we have the most recycled sex dialogue on the plannet.OH GODS - WHICH GOD ARE YOU CALLING OUT FOR ITS JUST ME HERE AND I DONT SHAREThey fall deeply in love with each other, even though they barely interacted throughout the book, barely created a connection and didn\'t even hate each other at all for longer than a couple of pages. She bonds with the most powerful dragons alive, one of her dragons is mated to HIS DRAGON, and every time the dragons get horny SO DO THEY. So they have to learn how to control the hornyness coming from the dragons wanting to fuck.I wish I was joking.The book ends with avery predictable cliffhanger (which is a rip off from Red Queen and Divergent)and now this is one of the best selling books in the world.Watchu gonna do.I guess there is something out there for everyone. Part of me thinks that most people got paid really well to love this book so much. But that would be disingenuous of me to say, because I know people who didn\'t get paid who enjoyed it. So I guess I can see that this book might feel nostalgic.It gives you all the 2001 writing cringe fest, so if you missed reading something like Twilight, you\'ll definitely have fun. The characters are as childish as Zodiac Academy characters, so if you enjoy that, you might have a good time. She steals elements from Harry Potter, Shadow and Bone (most of the plot actually) ACOTAR, and used the writing style and sex scene lines most booktok people love, soBOOM! Best-Seller.Anyways, I am finally fucking free. I think I have learned my lesson and I willl chill on the booktok recommendations for a LONG LONG LONG TIME.She just ""borrowed"" SO FREAKING MUCH from many other popular series that this feels so unoriginal. It almost feels like she threw this book into an AI and said: write me a YA novel and the AI grabbed all the most popular series and put it in there. The sex scenes are all repetitive and recycled. It reads like YA, but it has none of the good aspects from YA, there’s too much sexual content that adds nothing to the plot (and this is supposed to be a fantasy series) So yeah, it\'s a no from me. Too bad as well because the dragons were cool.UPDATE:I was literally going through my old Throne of Glass highlights and found ANOTHER series this author ripped off. Aelin says she wakes up everyday and tells herself she will not be afraid. Guess who does that too in this series? 🤣'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""”there is no me without you.”I. NEED. THE. NEXT.

AM. OBSESSED. WITH. THIS. BOOK.fourth wing had a great mixture between romance and high stakes, this story was giving me major divergent and the hunger games vibes like when i tell you the vibes where there, THEY WERE THERE. it had everything i loved (and dragons) - i haven’t felt this excited about a fantasy book in MONTHS but this was captivating and now i feel a reading slump coming bc of it lmao rip to me. this is a book that is really easy to get into, it’s very fast paced and was engaging right from the beginning to the very end, I WAS HOOKED!! this lives up to the massive hype it’s getting, i get it now.. i could have read this in a day, but i needed to slow it down and savour this book.➳ i found the fantasy and world building easy to understand (there are no dumb info dumps) - so this book is perfect for those who are new to reading fantasy; yarros takes what most other books only manage to allude to and truly brings depth to her story which brings it to life. i got hooked with the whole fantasy war school, quadrants and politics setting. this is a book i want to live in, i want to jump into the pages and never leave!!➳ i understand now when people say it was very predictable bc i guessed that ending from page 1 - however, i would much rather have a predictable book than one that makes no sense bc it is trying to confuse the reader w so much unnecessary shit added into it. this was done in a perfect way.”you look all frail and breakable, but you’re really a violent little thing, aren’t you?”↳violetis probably one of the most incredible FMCs i have read about in a while. i loved her tight bond w her sister, her dragons and the love she has for books. she’s tough, very strong willed, quick witted and not afraid to go the extra mile to succeed. she works through each challenge that is thrown at her by using her strengths and knowledge, and proves she belongs just like everyone else. i loved reading about her journey, seeing her exceed all expectations and break down every barrier she succumbed.— there is an disability representation with the fmc (she has a chronic illness) and the author done an amazing job at showing how her chronic illness doesn’t define her. i love how she shows everyone she is not some frail weakling that constantly needs to be protected.*cough* dain *cough*↳xadenis first introduced as the most powerful wing leader violet is warned to STAY AWAY from. violet had this superstition that he is out to kill her bc her mother had his father executed. but from the get go, we all know as an audience he doesn’t want to kill her, he was so smitten for violet right from the start. that man had weapons custom made for violet that would fit her body type, built a harness for andarna that clips onto tairn just so she could ride along with them and also literally made a saddle for violet to use on tairn so she doesn’t fall off while riding!! i can’t explain how much i love this man and his grumpy exterior but deep down he’s a big softy for those he loves. I JUST LOVE MEN WHO SHOW THEIR LOVE THROUGH ACTIONS!!— i will take no slander on him EVER. he is that typical broody, morally grey love interest ppl roll their eyes over, but he has DEPTH. this man fr had me kicking my feet in the air, giggling and screaming into my pillow whenever he would call violet “violence” 🤭 he is exactly what vi needed!! i just love how he always believed in her and only wants to see her at her full potential and succeed.the romance:oh my goddd, the romance was perfect!! 😮\u200d💨🤌🏼the slow burn?was burning, absolutely delicious.enemies to lovers?SPLENDID, BEAUTIFUL, EXECUTED PERFECTLY. i was itching for xaden and vi sm.the spice?DELECTABLE.

I’m trying to stop reading TikTok popular books, but the rating in this book made me picked it up. Fourth Wing was my first book by Rebecca Yarros, so I didn\'t know what exactly to expect, but at least now I know that it will be my first and last story by this author, because it turned out not to be for me.This review probably won\'t cover all the things I didn\'t like about it, as I started skipping pages after about sixty percent of the book. But without further ado, let\'s finally get to the point of my review—what exactly didn\'t work out for me in this story.The story didn’t hooked me up from the beginning at all. The main reason for this is probably because the writing style didn\'t speak out to me. I actually dnfed it the day before, because of that reason, but decided to give it another chance because I thought it might not be my day for it or maybe I wasn\'t in the right mood after a whole week. At one point I was even glad about this decision, but my enthusiasm didn’t last long. I have to be honest and say that around forty percent of the book I was pretty invested in the story when the dragons finally showed up. Unfortunately, it turned out I was only interested when the dragons were involved. The rest was just boring for me.The second thing is that I felt no connection to the characters. Literally nothing. I must admit that Violet had some great moments, but most of the time I was just embarrassed by her actions. The example.“Glad to see our year apart hasn’t dulled your tongue, Vi.”“Oh,” I toss over my shoulder as we walk into the hallway, “I can do quite a few things with my tongue. You’d be impressed.”That line sounded like a horny frat boy.Also, if you didn’t get it that she was short and tiny, the author kept reminding you of that, because that information was indeed very important.""I’m too short.""“So she’s small.” Mom scans me up and down""""Good gods, I don’t even reach his collarbone.""""I’m shorter than most.""“You’re pretty small for a rider, but it looks like you made it.”""I’m at a disadvantage, that I’m too small to climb its foreleg and mount,""“You’re tiny.” He says it like an insult""""I’m the smallest of our squad""“I’m too short for the ramp,” I whisper to Rhi.""“I’m too short to span the distance!” I hiss, uncaring that anyone could hear us.""\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200eThat\'s only from twenty-six percent of the book. I did not include the rest, because I would not have enough space for the rest of my review.Moving to Xaden—aka, your typical fantasy hero. Seriously. He was your usual tall, black haired, with strong sharp jaw, muscled body, but this time he was riding dragons. I almost forgot, he was""Flaming hot. Scorching hot. Gets-you-into-trouble-and-you-like-it level of hot.""you get the picture. He was also tall. I\'ve written about it before, but we\'ve also been reminded of it a lot. I had to mention that sentence he said here, because I was laughing my ass off at that moment.""You have incredibly touchable skin.”Touchable skin? What does it mean buddy?Honestly, the dragons were more interesting than the main characters here. If the book was about Tairn, I\'d probably be more eager to read it. This dragon had better personality than both of them. At least for me. Tairn was literally my favorite character here. That says a lot about how much I enjoyed this book.The last thing is the romance between Xaden and Violet. This series is supposed to have five books and they already done the deed, are in love—probably because I didn\'t make it to this part, and have a strong connection—again, probably because I didn\'t make it to this part. I thought that at least their first meeting, which is usually quite important, will be more spectacular. But, no. They met in the fourth percent of the book and I was like""Well, that’s it? Already?"". They were supposed to be enemies to lovers, the reasoning behind it made even sense, but they deliverednothing.I felt no chemistry between them, no tension, especially the sexual one, and no hatred that they should feel towards each other as enemies. Almost every time Violet saw Xaden it went like that.""I hate him so much""\u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e""But he is so sexy and beautiful and sexy. And tall.""Not even their first kiss and the cute nickname the hero usually gives the heroine saved them. The first kiss happened after Violet found out that they could feel when their dragons banged.Yes, they could feel their dragons banging.This information made me feel quite uncomfortable. Extremely even. I know they could get rid of that with some magic or whatever, but just why? The nickname ""Violence"" that Xaden called Violet was tacky and the book could easily have survived without it. Not to mention this line.""you’re really a violent little thing, aren’t you?”My only thought wasFrom Blood and Ash. It sounds damn similar. Even though I only read the first book from this series.Moving forward to the things I liked.The dragons.Ending my review, all I will say is that I am pretty sad and disappointed that I didn’t end up liking this book. I wanted to start a new fantasy series that I would be obsessed with, but I guess we can\'t have everything we want. I’m happy for people who loved it though. Good for you guys.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'If I had a million dollars for every cliche in this book, of which there are a multitude, I\'d still regret spending $20 on all 498 pages of this mess.Spoilers to follow :)Let\'s start with the worldbuilding!Now, this book had two things I love dearly: dragons, and an academic setting. Yarros, however, explains almost every element of her world so poorly and sporadically that the entire story feels as though it were concocted page by page. The hierarchy of squadrons and sections and wings is so unnecessarily confusing. The whole ""war"" going on along the border is so vague, it was obvious from the start that some twist was going to reveal the good guys were actually the bad guys all along. The author\'s primary method of exposition is dropping pieces of information into conversations that feel forced and completely unnatural. No one talks like that. No one shares information like that.Now, the writing!The sentence constructions alone were enough to give me a headache. I can\'t tell you how many times I had to reread entire paragraphs because of poorly written and run-on sentences. As for the dialogue, let\'s discuss the fact that everyone talks like it\'s 2023, despite the medieval setting. I\'m not kidding, the female character asks herself at least twice, using these exact words, ""Is it toxic that I like this guy even though he can kill me?"" Yes. Yes it is. And so is all this internal monologuing. Please, end my suffering. Apart from the sentences and dialogue, the descriptions were severely lacking. Every location felt like a vague impression rather than an actual place. I don\'t think I\'ve ever encountered a book suffering from white room syndrome quite like this one.Now for the characters. Oh, the characters.Starting with the main event, we have frail young Violet who is SO relatable because she\'s SO clumsy and SO bad at things! Simultaneously, she is SO smart (like smarter than everyone) and SO unique that she gets not one, but TWO dragons to bond with her! And of course, they\'re both the rarest kind of dragons that exist!!! And naturally, everyone wants her dead for... reasons. But does her life being in danger give her any sense of self control? Absolutely not! She argues with everyone and throws her sass around to both peers and superior officers with little to no consequence. This woman has the survival skills of a fruit fly!! Additionally, her moods go back and forth quicker than an Olympic ping-pong match. First she hates Xaden because he\'s a traitor. Then she loves Xaden because she decides to trust him. Then she hates Xaden because he\'s a traitor. I\'m expecting the cycle will continue in Book 2. Also, she starts off wanting to be a scribe and gets pissed when she\'s thrown into the Rider\'s Quadrant, then she decides she desperately wants to be a Rider because... because? The decision is given hardly any explanation or emotional weight.And then there\'s discount Rhsysand. Oh wow, the moody black-haired rebel with tattoos is actually the good guy. Shocking. He\'s hard on the outside, but a softie on the inside. Groundbreaking. Also, the way that Yarros writes his character from Violet\'s perspective is downright sickening at times. From the very first scene with him, Violet\'s internal thoughts about Xaden are grossly objectifying. Everything is about his body, and how hot he is, and how badly she wants to sleep with him. There\'s an entire scene spanning two pages where Violet and another woman are straight-up ogling shirtless Xaden while he\'s sparring with another guy. It\'s disgusting. If the roles were reversed, if a male author wrote about a male character viewing a woman in the same way, heads would be rolling. It\'s gross, and frankly one of the most disappointing things about this book.Honestly, none of the other characters were interesting enough to write about. The dragons were fine, and probably the most likeable. Sawyer was the only human I found tolerable. Dain was just annoying, as he was clearly meant to be.Now, the plot.The majority of this book was consumed by Violet being horny and a random series of challenges. There was no explanation anywhere of what the academic year would look like, which makes me think the author was just making up more challenges and battles and war games as she went along. All of this, of course, leading up to a real challenge where we find out information that was abundantly obvious from the start. Oh no, the good guys are the bad guys. The bad guys are the good guys. The dead brother is actually alive. I wish I cared about any of this, but I don\'t because it\'s been so blatantly obvious since the first chapter. The pacing of this book was tedious in a lot of places because there wasn\'t really any kind of looming threat beyond the vague allusions to bigger attacks along the border. Nothing in this book surprised me. Nothing came even remotely close. Everything was so over-ridden with cliches and ideas from other books (mainly Divergent, and a little bit of Red Queen with the not-dead-brother ending) that nothing felt original or creative at all.I have searched earnestly, to the farthest hills on the horizon, for something good in this book. Alas, I return to my homeland empty-handed.And here\'s the thing: I so desperately wanted to enjoy this book, which makes it all the more disappointing. If you\'ve made it this far, I want you to know I did not approach this book with the intention of feeling this way. If you enjoyed this book, kudos to you. Feel free to keep on enjoying it. These are just my thoughts and opinions, and I\'ll content myself to be the cranky grandma of Goodreads if need be.

I am in loveeeeee, easily the best book I read this year and one of the best romantasy I\'ve read in a while.

All she needs to do is not get killed and bond with a dragon, but it\'s not as easy. Not only she has to escape the clutches of the students who want her dead, with few dragons willing to bond; she also has to keep away fromXaden, MMCwho wants her dead.From page 1 till page 633 I was hooked. Theworld buildingis detailed and well thought out. Theplotis consistent and true to itself. Thepacing,fluctuates a bit in the second half but mostly stays fast paced for the majority of the book.""Tell me what you\'re thinking?""""I was thinking you are exactly as I predicted the first time you took me in my room.""""Oh yeah? And what was that?""""A very dangerous addiction.""Coming to thecharacters-⚡Violet-I loved her. She\'s brave, compassionate, goes to lengths to protect others and knows how to stand up for herself and others. Having had chronic illness, people always underestimate her(all but one)but that\'s what makes her an underdog. I liked how balanced her character and personality was, never over the top. Loved following her journey through the war school and boy how she developed and grew in those pages.🖤Xaden-Idk if anyone else is saying this but I will- Xaden has the same vibe that Warwick from Savage Lands does, but Xaden does it better. There\'s just something about their personality that\'s so similar. Give the Savage Lands series a go if you liked Xaden. Anyway, I loved him so much. He\'s a badass. Once her started opening up, and we got to see the softer side of him- I was swooning. He\'s powerful, sexy, and knows when to pick his battles, certainly not a push over.Dain-What an ass. Radiates the same energy as Tamlin in ACOMAF.The othersupporting charactersare good as well, they grow on ya- especially the dragons and Liam. Tairn and Adarana have my heart. I loved them since the first time they spoke. They have a sense of humour, are badass and protect so fiercely. Saegyl was okay-ish, not much of her tbh.Now I want a dragon 😭""I\'m going to keep you.

And if you like thecharacters being jealous,you\'ll enjoy that trope here too. I do think there was a pinch of ""who did this to you"" but wasn\'t that impactful. Xaden and Violet\'schemistryis off the charts. They compliment each other so well and I like how open and honest they are with each other, and that both of them don\'t hold each other back and give the other room to make mistakes, learn and grow. It is a mature relationship yeah. Also, thesmutwas hot.. no seriously, things did get hot and broken down 🤭Theendingwas an emotional rollercoaster. I was crying so much at one point, had to take deep breaths to resume reading. I cannot wait for the sequel 🤩It\'s such a masterpiece in my opinion.

You can\'t help but root for her as the quintessential underdog bc she never lets herself be a victim despite her physical limitations.

Of my time and money.I can’t decide whether to rate this 2 or 1 ⭐️.It’s a 1 ⭐️ rating. 🤦🏾\u200d♀️I’m about to drop some truth bombs,so if this is the type of book for you in where you don’t want to hear any form of slander, then look away.I’m going to be honest about my reading experience, which wasn’t all that great.😓It seems that fantasy romances, whether they’re adult or YA, have been using the same formula these past few years in where the focus solely lies on the plot and the action scenes and the same attention isn’t given to the characters and their world. And I do not understand why that is the case. The balance between them all is off.The characters (all of them, not a single one was interesting) lacked substance, background and history. So by nature, I’m not even remotely interested in rooting for them and seeing them overcome the challenges they’re facing, because they are so poorly developed to begin with.The foundation of this world felt unbelievably flimsy and read messy to me. It was supposed to feel dangerous, the stakes were supposed to be high. Characters were being killed left, right and centre and the only thing I felt was nothing.There was no order to the way it was being built upon. Just chaos, convenience and stupidity all round.Violet’s character could’ve been made more interesting (to me) if:▪️We had we seen her time as a scribe before she was forced to become a rider.▪️See her actually train and get stronger.▪️See how she generally fought through her chronic pain.▪️See her deal with the grief of her brother.▪️Explore the weird dynamic she has with her mother.▪️See the friendships forming and the romance truly developing.▪️See her fuckin’ bonding with those dragons.All of these things would’ve added nuance and depth to her characterisation, to the actual story itself. Are we privy to any of that? No. Those aspects are mentioned and that’s supposed to be good enough whereas I would’ve liked layers.Characters shouldn’t read so one-dimensional.And enemies-to-lovers where? Please. 🙄 This trope was used in the most juvenile way.You could argue that the romance itself was juvenile.We could’ve honed in on the hate since both these characters suffered losses, come from different and opposing backgrounds, have some real animosity and tension built between them but the love interest was hardly ever present.Next thing you know, the trope was flung out the window instead of it being morphed into something real.So, I fail to understand why this was sold as a fantasy romance.I can’t tell you why these two liked each other, let alone love. There was no development ofgenuine, romantic feelings.There was a buildup of attraction and supposed sexual tension. But that’s it.Another thing that bugged me is that we only got Violet’s perspective. I mean, this occasionally works, but ideally,no fantasy book should have a singular POV.I can’t begin to tell you how boring that narrative is.It gives such a limiting and subjective view of the world and the characters, and this especially gets more limiting when there are other characters present that also play a significant role in the story.Yet they weren’t utilised.Is it that hard to give different perspectives?The dragons were theONLYinteresting parts about this whole book.But they didn’t even get as much page time as they should’ve. They deserved more page time. I mean, if you’re going to have them talking, give them a POV as least. They could’ve told us about their own history.There were also some language choices that were made that felt odd in a fantasy setting.“Personally, I’m not arguing with their logic, just enjoying the view…respectfully, of course…”“So. Freaking. Beautiful.”“Holy. Fuckin. Hot.”No one talks like that in a fantasy world. 😒You know damn well some of this lingo doesn’t belong here. It’s so embarrassing and a testament to bad writing and bad editing.To top it all off, I still don’t know whether this was adult, new adult or YA fantasy. I couldn’t tell you. Goodreads has them all listed. Clearly, everyone is confused.In conclusion, all of this to say that this brand of poorly written, poorly developed fantasy story is just not for me. This book was not for me. I had a really difficult time immersing myself into the story.The ending was somewhat interesting, but by that point I was skim-reading. And I don’t care about this book enough to continue on with the series. I want to forget I ever read it.I’m avoiding all hyped books for the foreseeable future. 😪💔'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '0/5⭐️😍 OMG THIS IS THE (second) WORST BOOK IVE EVER READ IN MY ENTIRE EXISTENCE!!!🥰I’ve posted my iron flame review!! You can go read it if you liked this one :)Violet Sorrengail. Get it? SOARING-GALE BECAUSE DRAGONS SOAR ON GALES 🧍🏻\u200d♀️ THATS SO CLEVER.She’s like so badass because she’s like so dainty and like so small and has insert name chronic illness which makes her so badass and a really good candidate for a WAR SCHOOL. She is totally not a self-insert of the author because unlike the author she doesn’t have blonde hair, she has ultra special brown hair that turns a really rare silver as she gets older. (Because hair pigment works like that🤭)She’s also so super really fast because she’s SOO petite and small and little and fragile.And also the love interest is SOO much bigger than her and he’s the most powerful darkness-wielding highlord—oh sorry I mean dragon rider at the academy.because Violet being the daughter of the literal leader of the school wasn’t enough, she also gets a super mega rare giant black dragon AND a never-before-seen golden useless ass feathertailed baby dragon that has the ability to manipulate time. And don’t worry, Violet can summon lightning just in case you were concerned that Mare Barrow was the most obnoxious lightning wielder.Rebecca Yarrows is such a good writer 😍 all of her world building and info dumps are so unbearable to read!! Plus her writing is entirely YA and juvenile except for the horrific car crash level sex scenes that happen 80% into the book. What a slay!!All of her characters make me want to rip my eyeballs out🥰 but especially Xaden because he’s so tortured and scary and so much bigger than our poor baby fragile pathetic paper-boned protagonist Violet soaring-gale.The enemies to lovers is also so well done!! They were literally never even enemies😍 and I didn’t once believe they felt anything other than the most surface level lust for the other🤭Also why the fuck did Yarrows decide that when the dragons fuck that their riders also get really horny? That was information I did not ever need.The world building was so amazingly perfect!! I loved how she info dumped entire paragraphs of exposition and random facts onto us, but still never managed to outline how the actual school worked or why the fuck the gryphons couldn’t just be incinerated by the giant ass dragons with literal magic!!!!😍Oh, I also really enjoyed how the single black character with any personality was not only bisexual but hyper sexual and slept around with everyone!!! It was really great how Rhiannon was sidelined the entire novel so that Violet could also be useless!I also love how we don’t get to know anything about any of the side characters because Violet is too concerned with fucking Xaden!! 🥵The nickname of “Violence” for Violet, the character that literally did not kill a single person until the 75% mark also made a lot of sense!! I’m so glad she was at a war school and wasn’t required to kill a single person or even ever actually train without cheating her way through by poisoning her opponents!! She will totally not die in actual combat when she can’t sneak random ass made-up poisons into her opponents’ meals!! 😝I think it’s also so inspiring how Violet’s tiny 90 pound frame literally could not support swinging an 11 pound sword, but the dragons did not murder her for being weak (her words not mine) because she was so strong mentally because she complained about being in pain (despite claiming to be used to pain?) and so delicate and fragile all the time!! 🤩Also let’s just not talk about how Violet totally plays into the “toxic perseverance” trope by actively ignoring the symptoms and effects her disability has on her body and powers through everything because she’s “used to pain”!! That’s so good and such a good example to set <3It could have been interesting if Violet actually found ways to accommodate for her weaknesses/disadvantages that made sense, but clearly Yarros doesn’t actually give a fuck so she didn’t bother. The only example we have of this is a saddle which I’m sorry is stupid as fuck because why was everyone not already using saddles?? Did Miss Rebecca ever look into how fucking uncomfortable it can be not use a saddle or padding while riding horses much less consider how painful it might be to ride a giant, roughly scaled DRAGON that is FLYING THROUGH THE SKY?? 🙈This book was so incredible😍 I can’t believe booktok didn’t force this down everyone’s throats sooner!! It was so great to read this horrendous amalgamation of shitty world building, horrifically atrocious writing, and one dimensional characters with a nonsensical plot and a underdeveloped romance!!Legitimately the worst book I’ve ever read. I would unkindly ask Rebecca Yarros to never write another word in her life.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '— 5 stars ✰I LOVE YOU REBECCA YARROS”you gave me your heart, and i’m keeping it.i knew i was going to love this book. the amount of five star reviews & the talk aboutfourth wingon social media had me intrigued since the beginning & i’mhappyto confirm that this book is indeed worth the hype. like, mind-blowing-amazing 🫡dragon, dragon-school, competition, tension, enemies to lovers, you get thrown right into the plot, you have amazing antagonists. this book was purelyperfection. everything your heart desires, you’ll get it. nothing better than a fantasy novel with a subplot of romance, a good plot twist and am amazing cliffhanger. yes, you heard correctly. a cliffhanger. i might die right here right then because how am i supposed to wait that long for the sequel to come out?PLS GIVE ME THE SEQUEL NOW!! 🫠🫠—xadenriorsen. the man of the hour. the moment he appeared, i fell in love with him. i might be exaggerating but who cares, right? it’s the way violet describes him, i mean, how could you not fall in love with a brooding dragon rider who has a cut through his eyebrow. what makes him even hotter is the fact that he is the leader of the forth wing and oh my god, his “welcoming” speech.. i don’t know how yarros managed to make himthishot in a few sentences only. it’s his confidence. yes, that must be it. totally not his broad shoulders. or his rank. or his dark hair.“i had it made for you.” his lips curve slightly.his love language has to be acts of service. this man might have taken a while to admit his feelings but the things he did for violet? unbelievable. he was so ruined for her & i was so ready for it.—violet, my beloved. i justlovedhow everyone underestimated her and then she showed them what’s beneath that “fragile” body everyone seems to think she has. what i enjoyed most about her was that we saw her development, saw her fight for the place in the school and proving everyone wrong. she has a good sense of humor and wit, making me giggle — especially when she was flirting with a certain someone.“there’s a fucking smirk onxaden’s arrogant, handsome face.”there were so many chapters i enjoyed that were purely about violet without any mention of xaden & that means so much to me. there have been so many fantasy books were i was just so bored out of my mind when the love interest wasn’t there bc not everyone knows how to write a badass fmc with a great personality. rebecca yarros absolutely nailed it tho. the plot is just so gripping, you get sucked into their story and just want to read more about their world.as i am a big fan of game of thrones & house of the dragons, this book was a total hit for me. i loved reading about the dragons, the different breeds, their history, their shape and color and abilities.—xaden and violet. violet and xaden. you know who they reminded of? tris and four. the young new girl everyone scoffs at, the intimidating older guy everyone fears. also let’s not forget that xaden was the only person mira told violet to stay away from 🤭 their first interactions were so full of tension already, i was giggling and blushing and they’ve only changed a few words by then.”going for blood today, are we, violence?”did i mention that we get a training scene? but like a really hot, full of tension, angsty, fighting scene. she attacks him, he catches her fist, she tries again, he pulls her back against his chest, she jumps him, he pins her down. i could go on and on and on, believe me, it was really freaking hot.we even get a “let-me-see-your-injuries“ scene and if you thought the fighting scene was impeccable, then you have to read about this one. jaw? on the floor 💗💞🩷💕💘”there is no me without you.”—dain, what a hypocrite. you know who this ass reminds me of? adam kent and freaking gale hawthorne. i get that he wants to protect violet but he’s holding her back unlike xaden who wants her to unravel and become stronger. speaking of that, they remind me so much of warnette in that matter. i’m not done, they’re even torydarius coded. i loved seeing their relationship develop in a long time span. days pass, weeks pass, months pass. it’s not like they were enemies and then suddenly a week later they decided to like each other, nope, it definitely took them weeks to even admit their connection. they might be enemies to the core but who doesn’t love a good old enemies to lovers?alsojackreminded me so much of cato hadley from the hunger games. i know he’s evil and all that but every books needs a cato. and he got we deserved soooPLS I NEED THE NEXT BOOK AS OF NOW 💥💥'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3.5 🌟OK SO I GOT PLAYED A LITTLE!!!!THE GOODThis was a HIGHLY enjoyable book. I had so much uni work to do, but I still flew through it. The author wasted no time – she made a fast-paced, action-packed, well established fantasy world. I love how we got introduced to bits and aspects of this world slowly, she really KNEW how to world build, how to ease us into this complicated setting. AT EVERY POINT OF THIS BOOK I knew what was going on, who I was rooting for, what are the aims of the particular scene. And you, my fellow fantasy readers, know how that doesn’t always happen. Like I said in the updates, EVERY SINGLE PAGE WAS A PLOT POINT and no fill-ins. I hate it when writers drag the story, you can really tell when they do that, and fantasy authors are for some reason prone to doing that. This wasn’t such a book. It’s not that long (around 400 pages) and I wasn’t bored in any scene. I love how the story intensified towards the end, but the stakes were high throughout the WHOLE THING.THAT Xaden CHAPTER ATEATEATEATE, I LOVED IT SO MUCH!AND THAT PLOT TWIST IT ENDED ON, I COULD NEVER EVEN IMAGINE THAT HAPPENING! UGH, I can’t wait for the next book.THE BADI said it before, WILL SAY IT AGAIN, this is the most formulaic book I’ve read in my life. You know when popular musicians make songs SPECIFICALLY so they can become popular on TikTok and you SOMEHOW ALWAYS KNOW. Yes, this was that, but for books. You can really tell the author used EVERY SINGLE TROPE she knows people love and will eat up and put it in her book (enemies to lovers, mated pairs, the whole rebellion trope, I’m the chosen one but I don’t want to be that blablabla), I just couldn’t get past that fact. Before reading this book I saw a few posts saying how this book is similar to ACOTAR. When I just started it, I didn’t really see the resemblance, but THEN I GOT IT. Dain is SOOOO Tamlin coded, Xaden is basically Rhysand, again the rebellion thing, THE MATES THING (god I hate that so much). I wouldn’t call this a carbon copy of ACOTAR, but you can’t tell me it wasn’t loosely inspired by it (for the sole purpose of satisfying booktok).This was in no way original, and that’s the number one thing I didn’t like about this book. There wasn’t a single thing happening, a plot point, a scene, a character trait, that I haven’t seen before. This plays into this being EXTREMELY FORMULAIC.For those who read it, is it just me? (I know it isn’t)THE DRAGONS WERE SO FUNNY. I’m sorry, I didn’t like the dragons. I liked them individually (as almost characters) BUT they WERE IN NO WAY WELL WRITTEN. They’re supposed to be these mysterious, dangerous, sacred creatures, but Violet’s dragon says the word FUCK at one point. I LAUGHED SO MUCH, HAD ME ON THE FLOOR.THE CHARACTERSUgh, they’re supposed to be adults, but they’re SO YA CODED. You can’t tell me Violet is 20.Surprisingly, I liked the protagonists, but individually. They’re both flawed, but also with a sense of moral, a great combination of characteristics. However, them as a couple, not really. The banter was there in the beginning but then it just evaporated. They went from being enemies to LOVERS THE PLANET HASN’T SEEN so quickly. They were enemies for a good chunk of pages, I must admit that, but the change was in no way gradual (pls go to the Mariana Zapata slow burn school k thanks).(And also, Violet was so desperate with the L word, GIRLIE STAND UP!!!)The spice was good ngl (had me kicking my feet lol)I LOVED THE SIDE CHARACTERS. RHIANNON AND LIAM (sorrows sorrows prayers) HAVE MY HEART.FINAL THOUGHTSThis was a fast-paced, highly enjoyable first book in the series I will for sure continue reading when the next installment is out. It wasn’t very memorable and won’t make the FAVORITES list, but I still had fun reading. I’m leaving room for improvement.Is it overhyped, tell me in the comments??? (let’s have a respectful discussion)💕💕'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'if y’all see me on the news tomorrow it’s because i broke into this author’s house and tried to steal the manuscript for the sequel…i can’t even begin to describe the attachment and love i have for this book and its characters. it’s one of my favorite books of all time now. the author really wrote the most heart wrenching, emotionally loaded, appetite terminating sentences and said “deal with it.”to put into few words: this new adult fantasy romance book is set at a war college, there’s dragons, and there’s 2 main opposing sides that hate one another. our fmc belonging to one and our mmc belonging to the other. i think you can see where this is going…WRONG because you could have 30 guns pointing at my head and i still wouldn’t have predicted THAT last sentence. all my brain matter would cover the wall behind me.Violet aka Violence (iykyk) is my favorite character all around. she’s just like me for real. the way she thinks and talks. she’s really a girls girl. i usually prefer dual pov but not in this case. being in her head made me realize i’ve never had an original thought. she’s a fmc written by a woman to its core. she strong, resilient, a fucking genius, badass, witty af, compassionate, and so damn attractive…god idk if i wanna be her or be with her… everything she goes through and overcomes made me shed a tear or 7. she’s unpredictable and that’s what i love about her.Xaden…i’ve never read a man described so damn sexy. i was in heat and prepared to do a line off this man’s stomach…his middle name is basically “self control” and the way that crumbles from just the mere existence of Violet. he says it best when “i’m annoyingly aware of everything you do…”i appreciated how he has a personality outside of the slow (and i mean slow) burn romance. he’s protective but not overbearing. he’s idealistic and charming without even trying. he “hates” her but literally had daggers made for her specific body shape and fit. he had a saddle made for her body type so she doesn’t fall off her dragon. he’s so thoughtful and attentive, it comes natural to him like breathing. the longing that’s in his eyes when he simply glances at violet (you’d think he’d be plotting her death from an outsider looking in) was written like poetry. Violet has him so tightly wrapped around her finger and they can’t even begin to understand the depths of it…one would think the romance would be my hyper fixation for this book but it’s not even that (not only that.) it’s the fucking dragons! the way they are described, have personalities of their own, the way they always check and roast Violet had me LOLing and giddy. the bonds they have with their riders felt as real as oxygen in the air! 😮\u200d💨some quotes that aren’t spoilery but still had me barking like a dog in heat:👹“heat rushes through every vein, wakes every nerve ending. I hate the reaction of my body to the site of him, but I can’t deny it. His appeal is so fucking inconvenient.” she is so me coded“i know how to handle a corset” and he does“There’s a palpable energy in every room, he enters, and brushes over my skin, like a caress each time our eyes meet. Even now, I’m aware of every breath he takes, as he sits next to me midway down the table.”“fuck, that stubborn, feisty look always makes me want to kiss you.” god he’s so miserable 😩the MCs and dragons dynamic is so uniquely and well written like nothing else i’ve read. it’s so ying and yang coded. this book, in short, is a limb to me. cut it off, i bleed out and die! it is diverse, rich, deep, magnificently written, and every fiber of me loves it (i say all of this referring to a piece of media that ruined my life🥲)'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""This is kinda harsh but my honest opinion after reading the ARC ~** May 2023 edit: I'm a bookseller and read a variety of genres including children's and YA. My issues are not with these genres. My issues are with books that read as clumsy, horny (and not in a fun camp way), and unpolished. Which in my Personal Opinion(tm)!!!!!!!!!! this book is.It's pretty stock standard commercial horny hetero fiction. That's fine. Can't please everyone. I'll be totally honest: if you don't care that much about quality of writing and want an easy het romance-fantasy novel à la Cassandra Clare et al. (nothing wrong with that!), you may enjoy this. It's not my thing, though, and I can't recommend it if you want a decent wholemeal fantasy novel to sink your teeth into. **I found this disappointing and I’m frankly shocked it has such glowing early reviews.To be fair, my disappointment is partly caused by the misleading blurb and ARC marketing. The blurb implies a high stakes military fantasy set at a war college for dragon riders; this put me in mind of Temeraire, The Poppy War, or even elements of The Hunger Games. Romance is mentioned - “traitors will become allies… or lovers” - but it’s certainly not implied to be wholly a romance novel.I saw on the author’s instagram that this is being marketed as a “new adult fantasy” - if 'new adult' just means ‘lacking the sophistication of genre fiction but can’t be marketed as YA romance because of sex scenes’… then, sure, call it 'new adult'.All the characters - even supposed high-ranking military figures - speak like millennials from the year 2023. Why was the word ‘vibe’ used so many times? As in, ‘his vibe is weird’. But in other ways the setting recalls medieval Europe? Who edited this???I would not have picked this up if the marketing more accurately reflected the content. It’s 100% a romance novel in the vein of Cassandra Claire, Sarah J. Maas, the Divergent series; any genuine stakes are basically subplot to the central romance. The oh-so-important ~tension~ could be resolved by just… talking to one another? Most other world building elements are underdeveloped & confusing, full of plot holes, and everyone’s dialogue is set up to give the protagonist & ~dark~ love interest perfect Marvel-esque quips and one-liners. I get that this is a popular thing but to me it lacks sophistication and polish of contemporary fantasy :-)Also, my certified transgender opinion (tm) is that the inclusion of a random nonbinary side character was disingenuous and definitely tokenism, lol.The reason for two stars instead of one is because I found the representation of the protagonist's disability - and how it was navigated in such physically demanding settings - genuinely interesting.All in all, this, to me, read like a semi-edited fanfic. If that’s your thing, go buckwild. Otherwise, I can’t really recommend it. The blurb is pretty misleading, imo. Expect a YA romance novel.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '""Decide, Violet. Are you going to die a scribe? Or live as a rider?""Oh, this is good. I see now why y\'all love it so much.IfFourth Wingwere a drug, I\'d be an addict. It grabbed me so thoroughly from the very first moment and refused to let go. I was fully immersed, I didn\'t want to sleep, didn\'t want to eat. I just wanted to inhale it as fast as I could. And honestly, isn\'t this why we read, for this exact feeling?The action begins right on the first page and never lets up. There was no onerous worldbuilding, no endless backgrounds or introductions. We just seamlessly slip into the world of Navarre and Violet Sorrengail. Every time I get the itch to read fantasy, the one thing that holds me back is how much worldbuilding I would have to endure just to get to the good parts. But no such issues here. The good parts start right at the beginning.Is this the most original story? No. Is this the most well written? Also no. (Don\'t kill me for saying that, all you rabid fans.) In fact, the dialogue has me cringing at times, with its penchant for f-bombs as emphasis and its often basic but slightly pompous back-and-forth that only teenagers can pull off. I guess in that way, it is true to its characters since they\'re all not much older than teenagers.But slight criticisms aside, this story is executed to perfection. It takes several well-trodden tropes and not only cohesively blends them together, but also manages to squeeze every ounce of entertainment out of them along the way. And I\'m not above being entertained.This is my first real foray into the romantasy genre that\'s got everyone aflutter. And I can see the appeal. Fantasy is a bit of an adrenaline rush and so is romance, so blending the two together is really the perfect symbiosis. Of course you\'d want your hero to fight hard in a war between good and evil. And it totally makes sense that they would love hard too if they could die any day. And if the object of desire is one\'s enemy instead of one\'s friend? Even better.I\'m a little late to theFourth Wingparty, and there\'s good reason. I was certain this was a duology (don\'t ask me why I thought this), so I figured if I just held off a little bit, I could bam my way through both books without having to stop and deal with the inevitable anguish of waiting for the next book.

So many great descriptive words and all this author can do is spout curse words. Curse words do not a personality make. Neither is being a horny 13 year old.

He wrote many books, mostly horror novels, but was also the brains behind Beetlejuice and Nightmare Before Christmas. Apparently this Blackwater series is considered his magnum opus. This first book was certainly captivating enough for me to continue on to Book 2. Initially my reaction wasn\'t so positive, however. After an eerie, supernatural opening, the story steers into seemingly ordinary domestic squabbles. It actually reminded me a lot of Sinclair Lewis\' Main Street, or maybe Steinbeck\'s Cannary Row. Certainly not the in-your-face frights that the cover implied.About halfway through, I stopped worrying about when the beasties would show up and savored the uniqueness. This isn\'t your typical horror novel, and that\'s what makes it satisfying. The ending shocker firmly establishes what I suspect will be the central conflict moving forward--matriarchal power.Like any good creepy tale, the fear and surprise works best when it\'s rooted in realism. The large cast of characters are vivid and recognizable, and even Eleanor--with all her mystery--seems like someone real. Maybe even someone I know. I don\'t know how ""scary"" this series will end up being, but even if it is a magical realism remix on Cannery Row, I have a feeling it\'s going to be good.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""This book has it all for any horror fan!Creepy creature masquerading as human?

Right on!""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '”The town rotted beneath a wide sheet of stinking, still black water, which only now was beginning to recede. The pediments and gables and chimneys of houses that had not been broken up and washed away jutted up through the black shining surface of the flood, stone and brick and wooden emblems of distress. But no assistance came to their silent summonses, and driftwood and unidentifiable detritus and scraps of clothing and household furnishings swept against them and were caught and formed reeking nests around those upraised fingers.”Elinor Dammert arrives with the flood.No one is sure how she survived the flood in that room in the Hotel Osceola. Bray Sugarwhite, the black man accompanying Oscar Caskey in a boat when they liberate Elinor through the window of that hotel room, might have said it best.”He stared at the back of the young woman who had had no business at all being found where she was found.”The waterline on the wall paper in that room is higher than what she could have survived.Maybe she has gills and webbed feet.That is a knee slapper of a thought.The arrival of a new woman, a teacher, is an exhilarating occurance in a town where,”the most exciting thing to do in Perdido is sit on the bank of the river and count the dead possums floating by!”She moves in with Oscar’s Uncle James, who needs someone to help him with his daughter Grace after his wife Genevieve went on an extended holiday to Nashville and never came back. She likes to drink and have a good time. James”despite the possession of that wife and daughter---had the reputation of being marked with ‘the stamp of femininity.’”That “stamp” keeps the town from whispering too much about a single, lovely, redheaded woman living in the house of a married man while the wife is on “holiday.”Now Mary-Love Caskey, mother of Oscar and sister of James, doesn’t like Elinor, not one bit. It doesn’t help her not to like her, knowing how much James appreciates her or having to watch Oscar looking at her with doe eyes, like a moon sick calf. She doesn’t like the fact that Elinor is odd by nature and that she doesn’t know her people.Strange, unusual things start happening beyond the normal strange things that seem to be a hallmark of Southern living. Those peculiar things about the South that so inspired William Faulkner, Flannery O’Connor, Cormac McCarthy, and Pat Conroy to capture those essences on paper. Jewelry buried with a corpse suddenly reappears, and people go missing; there are strange noises, bumps and bangs, and doors shimmy and shake in ways they shouldn’t.”’Oh, Mama,’ she pleaded in a whisper, ‘don’t open that door.’”Of course, Mama hasn’t watched the movies that I’ve watched over the years. The golden rule of horror cinema is...never...open...the...door.The novel spirals more and more out of control as Elinor and Mary-Love become more creative in their battles to control each other.Michael McDowell wrote this six part series in the 1980s. It was the first serialized horror novel that I had ever encountered. The mass market originals were published by Avon books and have these distinctive creepy black covers. Copies in very good to fine condition are becoming quite collectible. I had many, many copies goes through my hands over the years of working in the used book business. This serialization actually inspired Stephen King, who is a big fan of McDowell’s writing, to serializeThe Green Milein 1996.Did you hear something, Michael McDowell?McDowell was a collector of death memorabilia, which might account for some of the disturbing descriptions that he uses in his writing. He was born in Alabama and died in Massachusetts, unfortunately, at the tender age of 49. Yet another creative person lost to the AIDS epidemic. He knew the South intimately. I could tell by the descriptions of these colorful characters that he created them in similar fashion to how Frankenstein assembled his monster, with pieces and parts of numerous people.As you can tell by the opening quote I started this review with, his books ooze with gothic nuances. The novel on the surface feels so normal, but underlying the words is this feeling of impending doom and the sizzling hum of menacing danger. The reader knows things aren’t quite right, but we don’t know exactly why.So get your feet wet”in the churning water dyed the color of the clay beneath---dyed red, Perdido red”and swelter a while with the people of Alabama as they clean up their water swollen hymnals, bump the alligators off their front porch, and try to restore their town to dryland.

Una saga que promete.Dice la sinopsis:Las gélidas y oscuras aguas del río Blackwater inundan Perdido, un pequeño pueblo al sur de Alabama. Allí, los Caskey, un gran clan de ricos terratenientes, intentan hacer frente a los daños causados por la riada. Liderados por Mary-Love, la incontestable matriarca, y Óscar, su obediente hijo, los Caskey trabajan por recomponerse y salvaguardar su fortuna. Pero no cuentan con la aparición de la misteriosa Elinor Dammert. Una joven hermosa pero parca en palabras con un único objetivo: acercarse a los Caskey cueste lo que cueste.Mis impresiones:Primera entrega de las seis que componen esta saga. Adictiva desde el minuto uno y con el estilo inconfundible de Michael McDowell. Prosa directa, ritmo muy ágil, diálogos atractivos y la maestría que le caracteriza a la hora de dosificar información e intriga.En este primer volumen, McDowell nos pone en contexto. La acción se sitúa en 1919 en Perdido, un pueblo pequeño de Alabama en el que confluyen dos ríos, el Perdido y el Blackwater. Allí viven los Caskey, una de las principales familias de la zona, dueña de un aserradero. Mary Love, la matriarca, gobierna a su familia con mano de hierro, hasta que llega Elinor Dammert, una enigmática mujer salida de no se sabe dónde, que va a trastocar ese orden de cosas. A partir de su llegada, una serie de hechos inexplicables, algunos de los cuales ponen los pelos de punta.McDowell tiene la virtud de ambientar sin parar la acción. La atmósfera que genera es de nota. He llegado a mascar el lodo, sentir la omnipresente humedad, oler el limo de la riada, visualizar las aguas rojas del Perdido, las negras del Blackwater, los robles de agua y hasta las camelias que separan las casas de Mary Love y James Caskey.Los personajes quedan bien trazados. Los miembros de la familia Caskey no tienen desperdicio, no se salva ni uno. No digo más, es mejor conocerlos con la lectura. Elinor Dammert, de la que no sabemos ni quién es ni qué es ni por qué se acerca a los Caskey, es más siniestra que todos ellos juntos. McDowell nos permite conocer datos que desconocen los habitantes del pueblo, pero nos deja sin respuestas sobre su procedencia, naturaleza y motivaciones. La intriga no es poca. Habrá que esperar a las siguientes de la saga.El final a cuchillo. Nos deja con la miel en los labios. No vamos a encontrar respuestas aquí, solo preguntas, intriga y ganas de saber. Recordemos que son seis libros y que afortunadamente se van a publicar con intervalos de quince días. Deseando el siguiente. Recomendable.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '[4.5]Una saga familiare, elementi oscuri, gotici e soprannaturali. UN CONNUBIO PERFETTO.Sono stata rapita fin da subito perché – anche se in questo primo volume sembra succedere ben poco (e comunque due morti già ci stanno eh quindi insomma, proprio poco poco non succede) – si comincia con due fiumi che sono esondati, città nel caos, una donna che salta fuori dal nulla, la matriarca della famiglia (nonché una delle donne più importanti del paese per via della famiglia di appartenenza) che fin da subito non è convinta della tipa saltata fuori all’improvviso, e sembra l’unica (o quasi) che si rende conto che qualcosa non torna, e via coi pettegolezzi, e via con la famiglia che battibecca e via con i cittadini che chiacchierano e additano e sogghignano CIOÈ DAI COME FACCIO A NON AMARE UNA COSA DEL GENERE.Poi mi chiedo una cosa: sono io troppo naïve o effettivamente il personaggio di Elinor sembra costruito molto bene? Mi spiego. Elinor è chiaramente quella cattiva; non tanto perché è misteriosa e mezzo mostro marino, ma proprio perché due morti ci stanno e tutti e due sono morti per mano sua (e se di un personaggio si può pensare: “be’ se l’è meritato”, dell’altro proprio non possiamo pensare una cosa del genere). Però io ogni tanto ho anche pensato: “ma è davvero così cattiva? Perché mi sembra che voglia bene a questa bambina qua, che voglia proteggere quest’altra bambina qua” e via dicendo. Certo, poi m’ammazza questo e quest’altro, però a volte sembra un personaggio più grigio che nero. Come se l’autore ci volesse far pensare che sia facile giudicare da quel poco che sappiamo e leggiamo, ma in realtà è ben altra la verità. E forse non esistono personaggi completamente buoni e quelli completamente cattivi. O forse sono io che voglio trovar del buono in chiunque. Immagino lo scoprirò con i prossimi volumi.Comunque bello, a me questo volume è piaciuto proprio tanto e non vedo l’ora di continuare con i seguiti.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'El primer volumen de la saga Blackwater que tanta fama y comentarios despierta.Las gélidas y oscuras aguas del río Blackwater inundan Perdido, un pequeño pueblo al sur de Alabama.

Mi enhorabuena a la editorial por tan buena idea para sacar la pasta..Entiendo el éxito que está tendiendo pero por desgracia no ha sido ni mi estilo, ni mi rollo.Narrado de manera perfecta, bastante gótica y parece que se volverá intrigante con un estilo que ha sido muy adictivo para muchos incluso cuando no está pasando nada de nada.Y ahí viene mi segundo problema y es que hubo varios momentos que me aburría ya que no pasaba mucho..Tiene una prosa y diálogos directos, es un libro muy corto y creo que todos son iguales, pero a su vez creo que con cada libro la cosa se pondrá mejor si va al grano.La información nos viene poco a poco dosificada a cuentagotas, entendible. Y supongo que es lo que genera y generará muchas ganas de seguir con el culebrón.Cortos y ágiles, es lo bueno, pero no ha sido mucho mi rollo. Me ha dejado en un medio sí medio no. Mi problema no es otro que la propia historia que no parece mucho de mi estilo como para atraerme y por ello la adicción de muchos no la he sentido. No me decido a seguir pero ya veré qué hago.

But in this book, the plot was slow, and the characters were rather dull. This feels like just a prologue to the series really, which is fine, but I felt like it should have either been about half the length, or should have had more going on in the middle. All of the hints of creepiness from the beginning were lost for most of the book. And those creepy bits were great, so I was pretty disappointed when they were gone.I’m not sure if I’ll continue on.

Unas novelas originalmente publicadas en 1983 también en seis entregas pero publicadas mensualmente. En nuestro país la editorial Blackie Books sacará cada entrega cada quince días.Ha sido también mi primer acercamiento a la obra del autor y he quedado maravillada con su estilo, con toda la historia y ambientación que rodea tanto al pueblo de Perdido y sus singulares habitantes como a sus ríos; BlackWater y Perdido.Y qué decir de la cautivadora edición 😍Es una auténtica gozada tenerlo en la mano, cabe justo en la palma con su formato de bolsillo, el tamaño de la letra es perfecto para los cegatos/as como yo 😂, tiene cantidad de minuciosos detalles en esas portadas que hacen que me pierda en ellos y no pueda dejar de admirarlos.Además, al principio se incluye un mapa del pueblo y un árbol genealógico de las principales familias.Una auténtica joya en miniatura, la mar de cómodos para llevar a todos lados 🖤📖En este primer volumen encontraremos más incógnitas que respuestas, nos quedan cinco entregas más por delante así que en La Riada nos iremos situando en este pueblo perdido, nunca mejor dicho 😜, de Alabama.Corre el año 1919, primer domingo de Pascua y el pueblo de Perdido es azotado por una gran inundación causada por el desbordamiento de sus dos ríos.Hay que evaluar los daños que no son pocos.En una de esas incursiones en barca para comprobar el estado del pueblo Oscar Caskey junto con Bray Sugarwhite se encuentran con una extraña sorpresa; una joven hermosa y misteriosa que no se sabe de dónde ha salido. Su nombre es Elinor Dammert y todo lo que la rodea es el gran misterio de la novela.A partir de su llegada todo empezará a cambiar en el pueblo, muy sutilmente al principio.La llegada de esta nueva habitante supondrá todo un acontecimiento en un pueblo en el que nunca pasa nada, o casi nada... Vamos a dejarlo ahí 🤐Recorreremos la historia de la familia más poderosa del lugar, los Caskey, dueños de uno de los aserraderos, principal fuente de ingresos del lugar.Con Mary-Love como la gran matriarca, el principal eje y centro de confrontación con Elinor.No encontraremos grandes escenas de terror, al menos por ahora, solo hay un par de escenas realmente inquietantes pero que logran hacerte estremecer, y si no que se lo pregunten a los pelillos de mi nuca 😱🤣 Y algunos hechos extraños que se dejan entrever.Todos y cada uno de los múltiples personajes están trazados a la perfección con lo que hace que muy fácilmente te sitúes en la trama.Pero si algo tiene McDowell es una gran creatividad y una escritura muy sutil a la hora de ir tejiendo una atmósfera absorbente en lo que auguro será un gran éxito. A mí desde luego ya me ha ganado con solo leer el primer volumen.Por algo Stephen King lo consideraba su escritor favorito y de hecho fue fuente de inspiración para sus obras.Definitivamente, esta novela encaja a la perfección en el llamado gótico sureño. Aquí lo primordial es el drama de esa familia de terratenientes, los Caskey, dejando en un segundo plano los elementos más puramente sobrenaturales, pero estos irán cobrando cada vez más intensidad según avancemos en la historia. Todo lo que rodea a Elinor es un gran misterio y estoy deseando seguir para descubrir quién es y por qué está en ese pueblo precisamente.Adéntrate en las negras aguas del río Blackwater o en las rojas del Perdido🏞️.Atrévete a nadar en la confluencia de ambos y conoce lo que esconde su limo.¿Te animas? 🔝🔝🔝🔝https://m.facebook.com/profile.php/?i...🖤📖'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '5/10Siento ir contracorriente con esta novela, pero lo cierto es que es un estilo y un género que no me atraen nada, con decir que a pesar de ser una novela corta se me ha hecho muy larga, creo que ya está todo dicho. Por lo tanto, es culpa mía por no haber tenido en cuenta mis gustos, pero claro, todo el mundo hablando de ella y siendo considerada dentro del género fantástico que me apasiona, pues tenía que degustarla.Destacaría sobre todo la ambientación, es lo que más me ha gustado y lo que más llamó mi atención mientras leía. En este aspecto no puedo poner ninguna pega, de notable alto como poco. Pero fuera de esto, la verdad es que nada más me ha gustado demasiado. Los personajes me daban todos igual, no he empatizado con ninguno, aburridos y sosos, sin nada que aportar, la narración es lenta y con momentos soporíferos y la temática fantástica, que es lo que me hubiera salvado, aparece en cuenta gotas, supongo que para enganchar al lector y que se haga preguntas, que obviamente no se resuelven en esta novela, que para algo hay muchas más.¿Recomendable? Bueno, si te gustan las series de época con tejemanejes familiares, yo creo que la disfrutaras bastante, ya que detrás hay una gran ambientación y grandes misterios por venir, pero si lo que buscas es una novela de fantasía al uso, pues casi mejor que busques por otro lado.No seguiré con la saga, aunque espero que a los que os haya gustado la disfrutéis.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'buenas vibes4'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '""Perdido would smell the flood. It had seeped into the boards and beams and very bricks of the houses and buildings. Now and then, it would remind Perdido of what desolation there had been, and what desolation might very well come upon the town again.""4.25 🌟\'sInitial ThoughtsI\'m back with some Michael McDowell, the undisputed king of southern gothic, and this is the one I\'ve really been looking forward to. His magnum opus, his masterpiece, the piece de resistance... that\'s his Blackwater saga in case you didn\'t know.This author made his name as a screenwriter with movies like Beetlejuice and the Nightmare Before Christmas. But before all that he produced some of the finest horror paperbacks money can buy. Including the fantastic ""Elementals,"" which is where I started with him. After being blown away by that, I went back to the start of his bibliography and saw a steady increase in quality from his debut in 1979, withThe Amulet, all the way up toKatiein 1982. He the released the Blackwater Saga, which was his final and, regarded by many, his crowning achievement in supernatural suspense fiction.Also called the Caskey family saga, it was originally published as a six-novel serial but later collected into a single huge volume. In a similar fashion to Stephen King\'sThe Green Mile. Good news for me and you as those originals are tricky to track down. And once I read one, I\'ll no doubt want to binge the lot!The StoryThe saga begins on a Easter Sunday in South Carolina and the year is 1919. A great flood strikes the small town ofPerdido, nearly wiping it off the map. But when the water recedes a strange but beautiful woman is discovered, byJames Caskey, stranded in the flooded Osceola hotel. That woman isElinor Dammertand quite how she survived all this time without food and water doesn\'t occur to her saviour.Elinor is surrounded by mystery and has no way of confirming her identity or history but despite this soon worms her way in with the rich Caskey family who have found fortune in the lumbar trade. James\' younger brotherOscaris completely bewitched by her, as is almost everyone else. Everyone but the Caskey matriarchMary-Love, who just doesn\'t buy this \'butter wouldn\'t melt"" routine. Is her suspicion justified? Well I think we\'re going to find out in this excellent family drama that\'s tinged by the supernatural. Want to know what that supernatural is? Tough luck, my lips are sealed. Just read the damn book and find out for yourself!""Elinor Dammert put things in place. She set things up. She picked up people and she put them down again where she wanted them as a child might arrange the figures in a wooden Noah\'s ark.""The WritingSo you love yourself some horror but feel let down by the lack of literary quality in the genre? Well you\'re in luck because McDowell\'s prose are a treat to read. He writes this one in third person, while allowing you into the thoughts and feelings of all his characters. But he does it with such elegance and craft that puts him up there with any author writing suspense fiction.Looking back at his career, I was slightly let down by the overall quality in his first novel...the Amulet. It certainly didn\'t compare to the heights he hit in his barnstorming Elementals. But in The Flood, he reaches and maybe surpasses the heights that I\'ve come to expect. It\'s as sleek as a water moccasin and as sharp as a gator\'s teeth. The way he paints that Carolina landscape is so evocative you just need to experience it yourself.The CharactersDespite being billed as a supernatural horror, The Flood read more like a soap opera that revolved around it\'s characters. And they are a fantastic bunch. All are engaging and beautifully drawn with enough individuality to keep them distinct.To be honest, going by this first book alone, you could completely remove the supernatural elements and I\'d still be thoroughly entertained. Particularly by the female powerhouse that is Mary Love, possibly the most conniving mother in history. I can definitely see a titanic clash between her and Elinor on the not too distant horizon.Final ThoughtsGoing by this first book I\'m thoroughly intrigued and can\'t wait to get stuck into the next installment...The Levee. There is definitely horror elements in this story, but they take a back seat to the southern family drama, which is without doubt McDowell\'s speciality. He has such an insight into the conflict that takes place within families and presents it fantastically. Something you just don\'t get in the majority of horror fiction.But never fear, if it\'s horror your after there is definitely something lurking beneath that rippling surface that is going to appear at some point. Like the Creature from the Black Lagoon. And I can\'t wait to find out which way this one is going to go. Join me soon for the next installment.Thanks for reading and...cheers!'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Michael Mcdowell (June 1, 1950 – December 27, 1999) was a talented writer who is perhaps best known for his work on the screenplay for the Tim Burton film ""Beetlejuice"".His final, unfinished novel ""Candles Burning"" was completed by novelist Tabitha King and published in 2006.McDowell wrote fiction at night while supporting himself through teaching and secretarial work.

Y me alegro mucho de ello, ya que ha sido una gran lectura. Es cierto que al ser solo la primera parte de un total de seis no puedo valorar en conjunto, pero como historia introductoria ha sido redonda.Esta es la historia del pueblo de Perdido, en Alabama, un lugar que vive de la industria de la madera, por el que cruzan dos ríos. El inicio de todo se da cuando ha habido una inundación y desborde de esos ríos que han dejado el pueblo anegado, y entre la destrucción encuentran a una joven que no parece encajar con la situación. El misterio está servido.Me ha gustado mucho la ambientación, enseguida te sientes como si fueses parte de ese pueblo. Los primeros pasajes con la inundación han sido unos momentos muy logrados por parte del autor. En cuanto a los personajes, se presentan aquí bastante, lógico, pero cada uno tiene su personalidad, son fáciles de distinguir con sus acciones y palabras. Aunque no todos, más bien pocos, te hacen empatizar con ellos.En relación a esos personajes, hay situaciones que me han dado muy mala leche, como por ejemploel momento en que Mary Love habla del reparto de joyas de su suegra (menuda arpía está hecha en ese momento)o cuando al finalse descubre el ""plan"" de Elinor y tanto Mary Love como Sister se convierten en auténticas psicópatas por quedarse con una niña que no es suya, pero entiendo que eso es algo hecho a propósito. Aunque también hay momentos de dejarte con la boca abierta, principalmente me refiero a las escenasen que parece ser que Elinor es medio pez o ser acuático, ojalá unos cuantos Profundos de los de Lovecraft para el desarrollo de esta sagaAquí mi valoración de la saga, y un resumen general en la sexta y última parte:1.La riada⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐2.El dique⭐⭐⭐⭐3.La casa⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐4.La guerra⭐⭐⭐⭐5.La fortuna⭐⭐⭐⭐6.Lluvia⭐⭐⭐⭐PD: esto se escribió y publicó para ser leído en entregas periódicas. No lo pienso hacer, de hecho ya he empezado el 2 y va a caer todo del tirón.💧💧💧💧💧💧💧💧💧💧💧💧After having readThe Elementalsby the same author, and with the huge hype that this saga is having with its recent publication in Spain, I had to give it a chance. And I am very glad about it, since it has been a great read. That being said, it\'s only the first part of a total of six, and I cannot evaluate it as a whole, but as an introductory story it has been perfect.This is the story of the town of Perdido, Alabama, a place that lives off the timber industry, through which two rivers cross. The beginning of everything occurs when there has been a flood and overflow of those rivers that have left the town flooded, and among the destruction they find a young woman who does not seem to fit in with the situation. The mystery is served.I really liked the setting, you immediately feel as if you were part of that town. The first passages with the flood have been some very well-done moments by the author. As for the characters, they are presented here quite a bit, logically, but each one has their own personality, they are easy to distinguish with their actions and words. Although not all of them, rather few, make you empathize with them.In relation to those characters, there are situations that have really made me angry, such asthe moment when Mary Love talks about the distribution of her mother-in-law\'s jewels (what a harpy she is at that moment)or when at the endElinor\'s ""plan"" is discovered and both Mary Love and Sister become real psychopaths for keeping a child that is not theirs, but I understand that that is something done on purpose. Although there are also moments that will leave you speechless, I\'m mainly referring to the scenesin which it seems that Elinor is half fish or aquatic being, hopefully a few Deep Ones from Lovecraft for the development of this sagaHere is my assessment of the saga, and a general summary will be in the sixth and final part:1.The flood⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐2.The levee⭐⭐⭐⭐3.The house⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐4.The War⭐⭐⭐⭐5.The Fortune⭐⭐⭐⭐6.Rain⭐⭐⭐⭐PS: This was written and published to be read in periodic installments.

He was taken from the publishing world way too soon.I\'m a southerner and a big fan of southern gothic literature. McDowell wrote a series called Blackwater that tells the story of a southern family\'s rise and fall, all due to a stranger who showed up in town one day.I\'m including an article I wrote for my library\'s blog about this wonderful author. Please search down his books and read them. You won\'t be disappointed.************************************************************The recent 9th annual Alabama Bound at the Central library brought to mind my all-time favorite Alabama author, Michael McDowell. Never heard of him? It could be the fact that not every great writer makes the New York Times bestseller’s list. Well, to be honest, most of our great writers don’t. McDowell is one of those writers. Unfortunately, he died too soon and too underrated.McDowell was born in 1950 in Enterprise, Alabama. He died in 1999 of AIDS-related illness in Boston, Massachusetts. In between he left his mark on different fiction genres and even rubbed elbows with Hollywood’s Tim Burton through their collaborations on Beetlejuice (1987) and Nightmare Before Christmas (1993).My first introduction to McDowell happened 25 years ago in my favorite used bookstore on Rocky Ridge Road. Browsing the horror section I came across a series set in Alabama. Blackwater (1983) is a serial of six books that tells the story of the Caskey family’s rise to power in the small mill town of Perdido, Alabama. The twist in the story is that the matriarch is something other than human; something that crawled from the red mud of the Perdido riverbank and set her ambitious sights on a man and a town.The Amulet (1979), Cold Moon Over Babylon (1980) and The Elementals (1981) are also set in Alabama and contain similar supernatural themes of revenge and redemption. McDowell is an expert at bringing to life the mannerisms and diction of his southern characters, from the sweet tea they guzzle in the summer to their endearing use of “gone” for “going.” It\'s not for nothing that McDowell\'s southern gothics are matriach-heavy; he really had an understanding of just who heads up families here in the south.McDowell takes a wide turn in his two turn of the centry novels set in New York, Katie (1982) and Gilded Needles (1980). Katie tells the story of a cunning woman, her dull, psychic stepdaughter and their desperate attempts to hang on to a carpetbag full of blood money. Don’t let the book cover showing a silhouette of a girl holding an ax dripping with blood and the line “Katie kills for kicks and cash” scare you away. This is not a pulp fiction throwaway but a smart, tense story that will keep you white knuckled until the last word. Gilded Needles chronicles the clashes between a mother and her family of thieves and a powerful, wealthy New York judge.Stephen King didn\'t call McDowell one of the ""finest writers of paperback originals in America today” for nothing. Tabitha King was asked to complete McDowell\'s unfinished novel Candles Burning, which was published last year to good reviews.Many of McDowell’s books are out of print and hard to find. So if you find yourself in some dusty used bookstore and happen to spot one, grab it for posterity.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Bueno, digamos que le he dejado arrastrar por a corriente de Blackwater, nunca mejor dicho!!La riada es la primera parte de la saga Blackwater de Michael McDowelll publicada por primera vez en español por Blackie BooksEn ella se nos presenta como los habitantes de Perdido tienen que hacer frente a la riada que ha inundado el pueblo mientras seguimos a una desconocida pelirroja llamada Elinor que pone patas arriba la rutina de los Caskey, una de las familias más poderosas de Perdido.Es una primera parte muy introductoria que sirve para presentarnos a los personajes a la perfección y para dejarnos clara cuál es la dinámica familiar de los Caskey.Tiene una buena dosis de salseo que nos tiene enganchados a la historia y ya empieza a plantar las semillas para ese componente sobrenatural que creo que va a terminar siendo muy importante para la historia.Pero hay algo muy importante a tener en cuenta cuando nos enfrentamos a esta saga y es que no es una saga en sí, sino una novela por fascículos. Esto quiere decir que este primer libro, e imagino que pasará lo mismo con los siguientes, no tiene un final ni una conclusión propiamente dichas, sino que termina dejándonos a medias. Menos mal que ya tengo el segundo en mi poder y puedo seguir leyendo!!De momento Elinor es mi personajes favorito y, a la vez es de la que menos sabemos! Me muero por descubrir más de ella en los siguientes tomos!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'The late Michael McDowell’s horror classic “Blackwater” (originally published in 1983 as six separate novels) opens with an epigraph about the maenad, which, in Greek mythology, referred to a female follower of Dionysus and literally translates as “the demented”. The female of the species, it is implied, is an embodiment of both love and cruelty, this contradiction being the ultimate downfall of women in classic literature.Women are at the crux of McDowell’s Southern Gothic horror story. They are the heart of the family structure, and they are the force for change. They are also at war---with men, sometimes, but mainly with each other. It is this dynamic, fueled by the feminine mystique, that drives the novel. It is bolstered by the presence of a cosmic horror with shades of Lovecraft. The result is magically creepy and wonderful.Book One, “The Flood”, of the six-bookBlackwaterseries introduces the readers to Elinor Dammert, a beautiful redhead who literally pops into existence one day in the most inexplicable way.The book opens after the Perdido River has flooded the banks and inundated the city of Perdido, Alabama in 1919. The entire town is underwater, and Oscar Caskey and his servant, Bray, are in a boat searching for survivors. They find Elinor in a room of the Osceola Hotel. She claims to have been there for four days, without food or clean water. When Bray enters the room, he discovers that the bed is soaking wet.Where did she sleep? How did she survive four days without food or water?Apparently, Bray is the only one who asks these questions, as Elinor’s story seems perfectly legitimate to everyone else. She is quickly accepted as the town’s new fourth-grade teacher, and she and Oscar almost immediately fall in love and get married.Unfortunately, Elinor’s existence is not welcome by everyone. Mary-Love Caskey, the mother of Oscar and the family matriarch, is not enamored. Her feelings of ill will toward Elinor are only partly explained by her irrational motherly fear of Elinor taking her son away.She concocts a horrible plan that will, if not lead to the destruction of Elinor, then ensure that her new daughter-in-law will be beholden to her forever. Thus, the battle between the two most powerful women in Perdido begins.“The Flood” is a fantastic family drama with the perfect blend of dark humor and supernatural terror. It grabs one from the start and doesn’t let up. McDowell originally published this as a six-part series, one published every month in early 1983, and I can only imagine that they were instant best-sellers.Valancourt Books, in 2017, re-published the entire series as one novel.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'me gustó pero pensé que iba a ser muchísimo más atrapante y turbioigualmente estaré leyendo el segundo como buena chusma que soy y porque encima el final me dejó con el culo lleno de preguntas'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""La riada, primer libro de la saga Blackwater me dejó completamente sorprendida.Aviso con antelación, esta va a ser una reseña larga.➡️ La saga:La saga Blackwater está dividida en 6 tomos, que el autor sacó mensualmente a lo largo de medio año, allá por la década del 80. Fueron libros muy conocidos, pero no fueron traducidos al español en su momento. Hoy en día llegaron a Argentina y podemos disfrutar de ellos después de todos estos años.Son libros muy cortitos y en habiendo leído el primer libro puedo decir que se siente como una gran primera parte de una historia que recién comienza. Hablando con gente me contaron que en realidad es una única historia dividida en 6. Y le veo total sentido.➡️ La edición:Tengo que destacar lo práctica y hermosa que es la edición. Es más chica que un libro tamaño bolsillo, por ende es más económico. Y tanto la portada, como el lomo y la contraportada tienen ilustraciones HERMOSAS con un acabado brillante. De verdad, parecen una pequeña joya.Pd. No sé asusten, el tamaño de la letra es normal.➡️ La trama:La historia es muy lineal, no necesita una gran trama para poder atraparte desde la primera página.Nos encontramos en un pueblo perdido (llamado PERDIDO), En los años '20, dónde ocurre una inundación y deciden evacuar. Cuándo dos jóvenes regresan al pueblo a buscar hallazgos de la inundación, se encuentran con una joven.Ella pronto se incorpora a la rutina de la familia y parece que todos la aman (o casi todos). Pero cosas raras empiezan a pasar a partir de su llegada.➡️ La ambientación:Tengo que destacar la ambientación, realmente me sentí ahí, con los personajes. El libro está muy bien escrito, con frases que te van a dar escalofríos.➡️ El género:Me preguntaron mucho de qué generó es el libro. Yo me atrevería a decir que es una mezcla entre realismo mágico, suspenso/ misterio y novela histórica. Me cuesta mucho encasillarlo en un único género.

No matter how hard I try, I cannot get this book out of my head, all because of those last 25 pages . . . \u2060How dare Rebecca do this to us, knowing we have to wait god knows how long for book 3. 😭\u2060Did I enjoy it?Yes.\u2060Was it better than Fourth Wing?No.\u2060But will I continue the series?Abso-f*cking-lutely!\u2060This book is really hard for me to rate because while I enjoyed the story and the ending, there were a lot of technical (plot/character) issues that definitely hindered my overall enjoyment.*SPOILERS AHEAD*\u2060What I liked:\u2060The story is action-packed from start to finish, so you\'ll never want to put this book down.Iron Flame is divided into two parts. Part one takes place at Basgiath War College and part two focuses on the Revolution. There\'s 623 pages total, and I genuinely felt like I read two books because so much happens. I\'m glad I took detailed notes because I\'ve already forgotten a lot and I know I\'ll need to refer to them before starting book 3.The continued world-building is fascinating.Like I said, this story is non-stop and that includes uncovering new information about the history and politics of this world. We now have a solid idea on what\'s really happening on the continent, however, there\'s still so many unanswered questions about the past (before the unification), the venin, and the Empyrean. I love this phase of a long series because there\'s still so much we don\'t know or understand, and I can\'t wait to see everything unfold and come together in the next few books. \u2060These characters are some of my favorites and need to be protected at all costs.Violet is still a badass. Xaden is still daddy. Tairn is fucking hilarious. And Andarna is the sassiest bitch in the realm. I do wish she wasn\'t away for half the story though.Violet internally struggled a lot more in this book by bottling up her emotions, distancing herself from her friends, and taking on too much responsibility (like researching the wards).Violet is just as strong and determined as she was in Fourth Wing, but in Iron Flame, we see the toll everything takes on her. I\'m glad that by part two she starts to lean on her friends more, but I\'m worried how she\'s going to manage after the events at the end of book 2. There\'s only so much a person can take, and I fear Violet may break at some point in the future. I\'m looking forward to seeing how her character develops in the rest of the series.PS: Violet during the torture scenes and and final battle when she saves Sawyer was impressive as hell! I respect her so much and strive to be just as badass.Xaden is still top tier book boyfriend material.Look, he is not perfect. In fact, I\'m a little pissed at him for constantly putting the responsibility of sharing truths on Violet throughout this story when he could have easily been open and forthcoming. BUT I DON\'T CARE. That man is just so damn confident, intelligent, sexy and loyal to Violet, that the minute he\'s on the page, I lose my damn mind. And when he writes letters to Violet . . . I melted. He isn\'t even a romantic guy, but did one of the most romantic things in the world.There\'s also a lot of side characters (both old and new) that I enjoyed getting to know better:Rhi, Ridoc, Imogen, Bodhi, Mira, Brennan, Sawyer, Jesinia, Sloane, and Maren. There\'s also a bunch of characters I loathe and wanted to see die a slow and painful death. Some don\'t. Some do. *cough* Varrish *cough*. Fuck that guy. But I can\'t complain, because everyone likes a good villain and Iron Flame definitely had a few!PS: I don\'t hate Dain anymore.Obviously, what he did was absolutely horrible and I don\'t think I can ever truly forgive him for the role he played in Liam\'s death. BUT we have to remember, he didn\'t know what was going to happen and seems to be very repentant for it all. Do I trust him? Hell no. But do I think he\'s a bad guy? No. I still think he needs to redeem himself, so I\'ll be curious to see where his character goes from here.Those few chapters with imaginary Liam were everything.😭 Liam\'s death absolutely broke me and still haunts me to this day. So seeing him again, in the way that we did, gave me some closure. But this entire situation has me wondering (THEORY AHEAD), what if Violet\'s second signent is her talking to the dead?! We know a lot of history has been lost or written out of existence, so I\'m wondering if the only way Violet can find answers is through some power of communicating with the dead?RIP Mama Sorrengail.For all of Fourth Wing and most of Iron Flame, I hated her. And honestly, even after everything, I still don\'t like her very much. However, while I know she wasn\'t a great person or mom, I understand her choices. Again, I don\'t agree with them, but she really thought she was protecting her children. I wept when she died, not because I am sad she\'s dead, but for Brennan, Mira, and Violet. They now know that even if their mom was misguided, her intention was driven by the love of her children and now that she\'s gone, they\'ll mourn what was and what could have been. They each had such different responses and I felt them all.The ending . . .I mean, I\'ve already talked enough about it but DAMN, I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING. I predicted General Sorrengail would die but I thought maybe Violet would get taken by the Sage or something. So yeah, I am still completely shocked by that ending, maybe even a little pissed, and will be sending Rebecca Yarros my next therapy bill.What I didn\'t like:This is a small gripe, but why are they using the Julian Calendar in this fantasy world?I mean, Rebecca created a completely new world but couldn\'t come up with different names for the months of the year? Every time it mentioned December or July, it totally took me out of the story.\u2060The pacing was frantic and for what?So much happens, yet, at the same time, I didn\'t feel like a lot happened to push the overarching plot forward. The highlights are: Violet goes back to school, Violet tries to learn about wards, Violet gets tortured, Violet and half the college goes back to revolution headquarters, Xaden and Violet get the luminary, and then the final battle happens. We didn\'t need 600+ pages just to give us that. @listenwithbritt mentioned in an IG reel that the pacing felt like she was watching a TV series, and I totally agree. Every few chapters felt like a TV episode with some small task that needed to be accomplished or there was a hurdle to overcome; then it would get quickly resolved and they\'d move onto the next thing. There were a lot of small subplots that were unimportant and felt like filler scenes. So the constant bombardment of action, angst, or mystery was a bit overwhelming and it was hard to decipher at the time what scenes were really important for the overall story. For example, what real value did the survival class or the death hike scenes offer? In my opinion, not much but creating small moments of conflict to keep the story moving along. Maybe Rebecca wrote Iron Flame this way since the series is getting turned into a TV series by Amazon.The story was too dense.There were too many new names, history, and general knowledge to really keep track of what was important. And there were quite a few things that weren\'t fully explained or were overlooked. Pair that with the frantic pacing, and there wasn\'t enough time to fully digest all this new information before we were forced to move on to the next part of the story. I had to read slowly, re-read sections, and take notes to keep track of everything. Doing that for 16 hours was a bit overwhelming and exhausting.I HATED the other woman (OW) drama.It’s a tacky, cheap, and overdone romance conflict and totally unnecessary. There was also a big inconsistency surrounding it. First off, Bodhi mentions Cat early on by saying how Xaden has never cared so much about anyone, not even Cat, which alluded that at some point Xaden was involved with and potentially cared deeply for another woman. But later, Xaden says Cat could die for all he cares and he has never loved her. So why was Violet lead to believe he had feelings for another woman at some point? Solely to create drama between Xaden and Violet. And why didn’t Violet ask Xaden about Cat the minute she found out about her? If she did this, she wouldn’t have been blindsided by it all CHAPTERS LATER when they went to get the luminary from Cat’s family.Also, Xaden should have been transparent about Cat when it first came up so Violet didn\'t spend chapters feeling insecure. And the way Cat was a nasty bitch to Violet the entire book, but then randomly decides she\'s cool with her after Violet saves her life was so anticlimactic. This was probably the weakest sub-plot of the entire book. And if there\'s more OW or OM drama in the rest of the series, I will fucking riot. Xaden better not use Cat to drive Violet away in the next book.I was underwhelmed by the romance.Honestly, their relationship was stagnant because they didn\'t have enough time together in this book. With Xaden being away for most of the first part and then they end up doing their own things for the Revolution during the second part, there was little time for them to really grow deeper as a couple.I also expected more groveling by Xaden at the beginning, but instead he makes Violet responsible for his honesty by saying she has to be the one to ask questions and then he\'ll answer. But for the entire book, Violet doesn\'t ask him anything! So, she doesn\'t get any answers! Meanwhile, Xaden just sits around, not communicating with Violet, when he could easily take the initiative to share his truths. Their lack of communication was so frustrating and was definitely done to create drama for the story. It was dumb and lazy writing. They could have easily set aside time to really hash out the issues of their relationship and dive deep into the secrets Xaden is keeping, but they don\'t.The smut also didn\'t hit this time.For the size of this book and the fact Xaden and Violet are an already established relationship, I expected at least five sex scenes, but we got three. Okay, I\'ll admit, the throne scene was hot but only because of the setting. I wasn\'t excited by the dirty talk and, yeah, the smut was just lackluster in my opinion. It wasn\'t bad, just forgettable.It didn\'t feel like any character had enough time to go through any real development.I think this occurred because there were so many new characters introduced that the attention of the story was split. Or maybe it\'s also because the story is in Violet\'s POV and she pulled away from everyone, so since she wasn\'t as ingrained in their lives, she didn\'t notice changes/growth? I don\'t know, but I wish we could have had more time with Xaden, Rhi, and Sloane.There were a few things that didn\'t really get explained.For example, why wouldn\'t Brennan encourage Violet to do research on wards? Violet was trained as a Scribe and would be an excellent person to assign for this task. I get he didn\'t think they would have enough time to figure it out and he thought they should focus on making more weapons, but no one assigned Violet a mission, so why have her do nothing instead of possibly finding a solution to win the war? His logic wasn\'t full-proof. Also, the end where Brennan fixes the wardstone. . . we spent the entire book trying to understand wards and then figure out how to mend them and somehow Brennan does this but we don\'t see how? It better be explained in the next book and not glossed over. Also, why did Xaden become venin? In the dream he has, the Sage said it would save Violet from dying while she was draining herself for the wardstone, but I don\'t see how thats true. If you have any ideas please let me know. And random but can someone please make a timeline of when Xaden would have been able to have a relationship with Cat? Because according to my math, he would have been, like, 14 years old! There are even more situations that needed an explanation but I don\'t have the energy to go through them all.Overall, Iron Flame was a decent sequel. I enjoyed it. I was entertained. But it was messy, and left me wanting more and less at the same time. It should have been shorter, the plot should have been cleaned up a bit, and we should have spent more time with our favorite characters instead of being introduced to a shit ton of new characters (whom I\'m still not sure are important). It really is entertaining though, so if you enjoyed Fourth Wing, you\'ll probably enjoy this one, or at the very least, be able to push through it.

I didn’t see that coming and while it wasn’t Zodiac Academy cliffhanger level of bad, cuz let’s be real nothing will be as horrific as Shadow Princess or Heartless Sky cliffhanger 💀\xa0Iron Flame ending had me spiralling.. how tf will this issue be resolvedIFit can even be resolved I’M NOT OKAY 😭😭😭Fourth Wing was so action packed and fast paced with lots of “OMG”-moments like when Violet bonded not one but two dragons, finding out the dragon’s power, certain sacrifices etc. So compared to the first book Iron Flame is much slower plotwise. It starts where Fourth Wing left off and continues with Violet and co. going back to Basgiath College for their second year and act like mentors for the new first year students.🗡️VIOLET SORRENGAIL(h) 🗡️”Violence, remember it’s only the body that’s fragile. You are unbreakable.”I love Violet so much, but I think she struggled a lot in this book with her position in this world and what her purpose is. Violet has the best intentions at heart, but feels like she is failing everyone and I just wanted to give her a hug this whole book 😭\xa0when she said that she never failed anything in her life but now she keeps failing and making the wrong decisions I felt for her!!But Vi’s struggle were actually the part that made me love her more. Yes, she did make some questionable decisions in this book, but that’s what makes her character so realistic for me. She tries her best and sometimes her best isn’t enough, but this girlnevergives up. She will keep standing up no matter how many times she gets kicked down. She will find the solution to the problem no matter how many hours she will need to research, but she will do the work.That scene with her Varrish and Nolan and a certain other character whose name I can’t name killed me 😭\xa0it was so painful to read.. Violet was so strong for enduring everything and not losing her mind completely.. I would have folded so quickly 🌚\xa0Violet Sorrengail best girl. There is a reason she bonded not one, but two dragons. 💅🔹XANDEN RIORSON(H) 🔹“Violet.” His gaze rakes over my face, lingering on my cheeks. I love the way he says my name. Sure, it’s the alcohol overruling my logic, but I want to hear him say it again. “Lieutenant Riorson.”LIEUTENANT RIORSON Y’ALL. If you think WINGLEADER Xaden was hot wait til you get Xaden as a lieutenant that just hits differently 🛐\xa0He was so hot in this book.Xaden has still so many secrets we don’t know about and I think there is still so much to his story. Like where did his mother disappear? I’m still so intrigued by his character and now even more after that ending… I didn’t see that coming and I’m still shocked. I wish we would get more Xaden POVs in the books because the one at the end is never enough… with that ending I hope that Xaden will be more of a focus in the next book, cause I just want to know more about him.🐉TAIRN & ANDARNA (DRAGONS)🐉“A rolling dismount would tear you limb from limb on impact,” he retorts.“You don’t know that,” Andarna counters with what seems to be her new default form of conversation—telling Tairn he’s wrong. A growl rumbles through Tairn’s chest, vibrating the saddle beneath me and the harness that holds Andarna to his chest.“I’d watch it,” I tell her, biting back a smile. “He might get tired and drop you.”“His pride would never allow it.”“Says the dragon who spent twenty minutes refusing to put on her harness,” Tairn fires back.It would be a huge lie if I’d say I haven’t missed my sunshine princess Andarna in this book, because I did, but eventually all babies have to grow up and Andarna became a teenager 🥺\xa0her angsty teenager attitude towards Tairn had me laughing my ass off. I love their relationship so much and they are the best father-daughter duo. Their bond is so precious! When Andarna said she wanted to be just like Tairn, because he is loyal, fierce and strong it made me so emotional 😭😭\xa0And to my grumpy, firerce, strong and loyal dragon Tairn.. I can only say that I thought I couldn’t love him more after Fourth Wing, but I do now. The way Tairn protects Violet and stands by her side is everything. The relationship that the dragons have with their riders is *chef’s kiss*🧚THE ROMANCE🧚I meant what I said on the parapet. Even when I’m not with you, there’s only youMy violetxaden heart was so happy!! I mean I knew Violet would be really stubborn about the Xaden lying to her thing and would hold it against him for quite some time, but I loved the angst that created. But Xaden is completely smitten with her and we love to see an obsessed boy. Vi doesn’t think that he would choose her over the revolution, but she doesn’t realized that Xaden would burn down the world for her 😌\xa0he is not like that rule-following loser Dain .. Xaden would break every rule for her and the way Xaden is so worried for Vi and wants to protect her has my heart melting into a puddle 🥰Also can we talk about Xaden writing Violet letters while he is away?? that is so romantic and had me going 🥺\xa0I only wished we could have read more of his letters and not only small excerps. Don’t be shy Rebecca give us the full content.👫SIDE CHARACTERS👫Rhiannon:my queen i love you, it took me forever to remember you name, but now you better survive until the end or i will personally hunt Rebecca til the end of the worldRidoc:my comedic king i love youImogen: i love you my other kickass queenDain:fuck you, i haven’t forgiven you and i don’t think i willJesinia:what a cutie, i like her and she better stays loyal to Violet and doesn’t betray herCat:FUCK YOU, but in capital letters.Varrish:oh i hope someone fucks you with a 10 inch pole i fucking hate you. that c*nt… why does every magical school has a Professor Umbridge character that is so detestable. This man will answer for all his sins and the atrocities he commited against Violet. I hope this loser never finds a moment of peace.to the rest of the side characters: you were either irrelevant, i couldn’t remember you’re names or i refuse to remember to name, cause you going to die either way in this book or later.👯\u200d♀️VIOLET & MIRA & BRENNAN👯\u200d♀️the scene where Mira finds out that Brennan is alive and punches him in the face lives in my mind rent free. That’s my girl lmao cause I would react the same way if I’d find out one of my sibling pretended to be death for the last six years. I’D BE LIVID.But it was great to see all Sorrengail siblings back together. I love seeing them all together and get a glimpse of their different dynamics with each other. When Mira and Brennan were fighting and Violet was just standing next to them and felt like their little sister again dksdskd 😭\xa0I love them and they are all badasses in their own way.🔻WHY IRON FLAME WAS WEAKER THAN FOURTH WING IMO🔻↠ if Fourth Wing was Catching Fire (The Hunger Games) then I’d say that Iron Flame is Mockingjay in terms of action and pace. As I mentioned abovethis book is much more slower paced. It’s one of those books where a lot happens, but at the same time nothing at all, because they are trying to establish the rebellion, gather their tropes, find out more information how to raise the wards etc. So it deals with the characters getting to class and learning about magic etc. While a lot of people still die in this book, Iron Flame just didn’t feel as high staked imo as Fourth Wing did. Violet and her friends survived all the trials and first year, so I didn’t feel like I was constantly on the edge of my seat not knowing what will happen next. Don’t get me wrong there were many scenes that HAD ME STRESSED OUT and sweating, because it was intense, but it wasn’t intense as a whole as Fourth Wing and didn’t me give me as much nostalgia as Fourth Wing did.↠ theinfo-dumpingwas a bit much in this book. I think Fourth Wing had the perfect amount of world building and information. Iron Flame had a lot of information because the characters are going to class and learn about new magic and trying to gather info on how to raise wards and power the wardstone etc. and I get that it was important, but seeing them look for information, just to try it and fail and then having to continue their search was a bit exhausting.↠ some of the themes in this book were repetitive. Since Violet and Xaden couldn’t see each other a lot in the first half of the book I ate up every scenes they had together, but the things they were fighting over were always the same.. Violet not being able to trust him, them not being able to proper communicate with each other, Violet complaining about Xaden lying and having too many secrets .. that was pretty much the root of every single fight they had. Their push and pull was a bit tiring to read at the beginning cause they had the same argument over and over again.CONCLUSIONFourth Wing was a perfect book for me and a 10 outta 10 so even though Iron Flame didn’t reach that level for me and had quite some flaws, it was still an enjoyable book to read and I love love love this world so much with the dragon and magic and harry potter vibes. I love this series and after that brutal ending I need the next book in my hands right now. Praying that we don’t have to wait a whole year for the next book to come out.P.S: What is the author going to write in the next THREE books?! We are already in the middle of fighting against the venin and wyvern and I hope RY doesn’t drag out the storyline too much and makes it another Zodiac Academy situation 💀┍━━━━━━━━»•» «•«━┑THE EMPYREAN SERIES#1 Fourth Wing –\xa05 stars#2Iron Flame–\xa04 stars┕━»•» «•«━━━━━━━━┙'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '0/5 ⭐️ you thought Fourth Wing was bad…? Oh you sweet summer child.Goodreads has been real finicky about reviews recently so I will only be speaking on the book and its content (not the author though I have very many opinions (none of them kind☺️))also there are spoilers in this review but who cares because you shouldn’t be reading this book to begin with! (Don’t let my sacrifice be in vain)I intended to get this review out way sooner but unfortunately (and unsurprisingly) this book was actually so much worse than Fourth Wing!🥳I naively assumed Fourth Wing would be the top contender for worst book of the year but Iron Flame made me wish I was reading Fourth Wing!!At least Fourth Wing had the decency to be short enough to get through in a week, Iron Flame takes every flaw of Fourth Wing and not only makes it worse but makes it LONGER(???!?!) while somehow simultaneously being even more boring! Wow!🤩 Good job Yarros!!! What a fantasy icon!!🧝🏻\u200d♀️Remember how Fourth Wing had one of the most idiotic, and juvenile writing styles in any adult fantasy book ever? Imagine that but now in a world where editing was never invented!! 🥰The sentence structure was legitimately horrendous. I actually wish I was kidding.If you have the unfortunate displeasure of being in a twenty mile radius of a copy of Iron Flame and are unlucky enough to stroll past it in the store or your local library, I beg you, after you recover from the sheer horror of being in the same room as such an abomination to fantasy, open it to a random page and just ATTEMPT to read a paragraph out loud.I am a creative writing major, I read books out loud all the time. I have never struggled so much with a book in my entire life. Sincerely whoever had to do the audio book must have the endurance and the mental fortitude of a saint.Forgive me, Yarros, for believing reading should be an enjoyable experience, clearly you do not agree. 🧎\u200d♀️Also Yarros used 493 ellipses and 1089 em-dashes on my count! The book is about 634 pages!💫And oh! A Drinking game🥂: take a shot every time a character’s eyebrow or brow or brows are mentioned!! Actually don’t! You’d definitely die! Brows are mentioned over a hundred times!!🫠 I have to laugh (or else I might scream) at the idea that THIS is accessible fantasy because not only is the plot and the world building convoluted and unengaging but the writing is so incredibly shit that it makes you reread half of the sentences over again if you want to the vaguest inkling of an idea of what is going on in this horseshit world. To call Iron Flame accessible spits in the face of twenty plus years of hard work and effort by truly talented authors to make fantasy books that are actually welcoming and accessible to a wide audience.Let’s actually talk about the plot. Fourth Wing was derivative and predictable and Iron Flame doesn’t even try to be any more.Here’s a list of some 🌈✨creative😍 plot points Yarros used:- A shitty copycat version of the Hunger Game’s rebellion (with zero of the interesting nuance or intelligent discourse)😯- what is essentially a boring Umbridge at a half-assed attempt to create tension😧- The Rider Quadrant and the Infantry Quadrant finally interact!! They are dropped in the middle of a forest, are being hunted by dragons, and are given two maps and told to go to a location marked on the maps! A simple assignment for students at a war school who surely know how to navigate using a map because that’s an important skill for soldiers to know, right?! 🗺️ Not only do these riders not learn how to read a map until year two (WHY?) but apparently the Infantry and Riders hate each other so much😠 that THEY DON’T EVEN COMPARE THE TWO MAPS WHEN PEOPLE HAVE CONFLICTING IDEAS ABOUT WHERE THEY ARE. THEY WALK AROUND IN A FOREST FOR HOURS INSTEAD OF COLLABORATING ONCE. I don’t care how much you hate someone at school, if you are given a group assignment literally step one is compare all documents you have been given so you can be done as quickly as possible. ALSO WHEN ONE OF THE INFANTRY ASKS TO WHAT TO SO IN THE EVEN OF A DRAGON ATTACK THE RIDERS LAUGH AND MAKE FUN OF THEM FOR BEING SCARED??? THEN WHEN A DRAGON ATTACKS THE RIDERS ARE MAD AT THE INFANTRY FOR DOING THE WRONG THING AFTER THEY LITERALLY WERE NOT TOLD WHAT TO DO!! Yarros when I find you Yarros Yarros when I find you Yarros🏃\u200d♀️🏃\u200d♀️- Jack Barlow back because I guess Yarros couldn’t come up with another new antagonist… also he’s Venin for reasons. Really it’s not that interesting. The resurrection trope is so fun!!🤩🤗- A torture scene summary that is not scary in the slightest because this book conditions you to know that Violet is never in any real danger despite trying to tell you she is always on the verge of death 😱- A visit to what is essentially the Summer Court in search the Book of some bullshit thing called a luminary (btw we don’t even know what it looks like until 60% through the book AFTER they’ve acquired it???)🤫- a catty ex-girlfriend (named Cat, wow ✨creative✨) making a reappearance and doing nothing but promotes wonderful stereotypes (even though Yarros tries really hard to tell you it doesn’t on page the literal page)💃🏻- and the most anticlimactic and boring battle with the dumbest ending I’ve ever read!! 🤺There are more stupid plot points, but I’m getting brain damage trying to remember the plot of this book so I’m just going to talk about things that made me wish I was attempting to consume whole boulders rather than read the most accessible fantasy book of all time: Iron Flame by Rebecca Yarros😇Varrish. He’s our Umbridge lookalike. He strolls into the Dragon Rider Academy and he’s super scary with his one-eyed dragon Solas!!! 😰I mean he would have been, but literally the first time he does anything scary by letting his dragon incinerate an entire squad, TAIRN FLYS IN AND THREATENS SOLAS. AND SOLAS AND VARRISH BOTH COWER BECAUSE TAIRN IS SO BIG AND SUPER SCARY AND THE 🌈✨⭐️MoST PoWErFuL⭐️✨🌈 DraGOn😀Well maybe this is understandable because Solas just killed like twenty people, right?🤔 But no! Tairn isn’t mad about that, he’s mad because Violet got like a first degree burn.I don’t know what Yarros was attempting to achieve with this scene but you know what it does achieve? It tells the reader that Varrish isn’t actually a scary villain because having Tairn put him in his place the moment he does a single villainous action. IT DESTROYS ALL TENSION YOU COULD HAVE HAD.🧍🏻\u200d♀️And don’t you worry, dearest reader, this is a trend. LATER TAIRN MAKES VARRISH GET ON HIS KNEES AND APOLOGIZE TO VIOLET FOR BEING MEAN TO HER. ⁉️⁉️IN FACT ANYTIME ANYONE IS MEAN TO VIOLET THE ENTIRE WORLD COMES TO HER DEFENSE. Any character, any dragon, I swear to god a speck of dust could land on Violet wrong and the entire cast of characters would jump them. And it’s not just her friends. THE SIDE CHARACTERS, MAIN CHARACTERS, CHARACTERS WITH LITERALLY A SINGLE LINE OF DIALOGUE, MINOR AND MAIN ANTAGONISTS.THEY ALL COMPLIMENT VIOLETC O N S T A N T L Y.VARRISH COMPLIMENTS HER, THE VENIN COMPLIMENT HER, CAT COMPLIMENTS HER.Sloane (the sister of Liam, the stupid dead guy👱🏻\u200d♂️ that Violet tries to convince us was her friend) says the most benign of comments against Violet and Rhiannon and every other personality-devoid lampshade of a character in a seven mile vicinity practically threatens to jump this GRIEVING 20 year old girl.Characters that Violet doesn’t even know will compliment her out of the blue.THE BOOK READS LIKE AN INSECURE PERSON WISH FUFILLMENT. 💇\u200d♀️It’s so unbelievably unbearable. 👹The Violet Defense Squad™️ is literally in every chapter. My favorite part about this book was that I couldn’t find a chapter where Violet isn’t complimented for doing literally nothing in any of all 66 chapters of the entire book.🤭🤩And in case you were concerned that anyone who was mean to Violet would get interesting character development, nope! They either end up dead or want to be her friend by the end🥰 awesome!😎 Violet is my favorite character😍Are you interested in Violet’s character arc? Well let me tell you the wonderful highs of this perfect character that we’re supposed to root for and support!!😘Violet starts out strong by making insane demands of Xaden like demanding he tell her literally everything even though she had her mind read last book! And she doesn’t just mention this once. She mentions this every single time we see Xaden. She doesn’t trust him, she tells us, but she loves him, she tells us. 🙄 They’re such a cute and believable and interesting couple 🥰🥰 and their dynamic is made so much better by that random ex-girlfriend that was included because Yarros got bored I guess!😍On top of being annoying and insecure, Violet decided that this book she would also double down on being one the worst people imaginable! Remember when all those people Violet considered friends died in her first year and she was so sad about that?Well actually this book Violet tells us that she’s gained some new perspective!!🤯Actually she’s glad all those people died because watching all those people die made her a better rider because they inspired her to… not die(?)! Because that’s a normal and morally good thing for our main character that is SO empathetic and SO kind to say!🙈 Violet is so good, I wish I was just like her!!!☺️Also remember Sloane and her dead brother?!👱🏻\u200d♂️ Well Liam spent all of book one writing letters to Sloane, his only living family! Wouldn’t it be so nice if Violet gave those to Sloane out of the kindness and goodness of her heart to help Sloane cope with the loss of her older brother?!😊 Well she didn’t!!Violet withheld the letters for weeks after Sloane arrived at the school, (weeks in which Sloane very well could have died by the way) and only offered to give Sloane the letters if she agreed to train with Imogen (a girl Sloane does not like) and only agreed to give her one letter a week!! There are over fifty letters Violet! What happens if Sloane dies during a freak accident which you KNOW are rampant at this death school???! Violet is such an empath guys🥺 she really understands and cares for the people around her.😣 Don’t you wish you were just like her?!😁Violet also does a variety of things such as:- Dropping a gryphon flier off the side of a cliff and then being surprised when said gryphon flier’s friends don’t like her? Inspirational💫- Talking shit on the infantry for not trusting dragons and being cowards after literally being a prime example as to why the infantry should not trust riders or their dragons! So empathetic🥺- Wanting to murder Xaden’s ex for saying a couple of barely mean comments to her! A totally rational response!!!👍- Trying to translate a journal from a dead language she doesn’t know (she does know many other dead languages, of course) instead of giving it to the girl that she’s knows understands that dead language! Wow! the smartest main character of our generation! 🤯- Accusing every scholar and student of the school of perpetuating misinformation and hiding history that she herself just found out about! She’s so kind and thoughtful 🥳- Forgetting instantly about her friend who got her neck snapped after some assassin asked who Violet Sorrengail was. She cares so much about her friends!👯\u200d♀️- And many, many more abhorrent things🤩In case you forgot (because apparently Yarros did 90% of the book) Violet has EDS. Sometimes it’s brought up, but not really with any substance. And Violet just wraps her joints and “pushes through it” and “puts all her pain into a box” (??) and pretends she doesn’t have a problem at all. No further accommodations are granted to her in this book aside from the saddle from last book which is already dumb because everyone trying to hold onto a flying creature should be using saddles anyway.I highly suggest: Fly Or Die: The Ableist Narrative of Toxic Perseverance by Ella T Holmes for a much better explanation than I can provide as someone that doesn’t have EDS.Let’s talk about Xaden because if I have to think about how super special and powerful and amazing Violet is I might eat all the gravel in my backyard. Xaden’s depiction in this book is gross to say the least.Rebecca has confirmed that he’s a PoC which is great!Keeping that in mind, I love how he’s described as incapable of love and is called a monster and is untrustworthy!!😍😍And I absolutely adore that our super special and talented basic white girl Violet is the person that shows him true love and trust and is the only person who can take his mask of cruelty and violence off for the first time even though she’s so much smaller and weaker than big, strong, powerful Xaden. It’s so cool that all the other characters are so terrified of him and that he acts as little more than Violet’s big overprotective and jealous guard dog! I especially love that Violet’s mom practically tortured him and gave him a hundred and something scars and that he has to take responsibility for all of the marked ones!! That’s not concerning and horrific!!!! And I love that he also got another scar for “claiming” Violet!! that’s so attractive and romantic and good representation and not at all fetishizing men of color at all!!!🥰🥰🥰 Thank you so much for your hard work Yarros!!!🫡He’s also annoying and refuses to tell Violet anything unless she asks hyper specific questions. Their whole dynamic is just annoying and stupid.And I love all of Yarros’ other characters who have less personality than paper bags with faces drawn on them!!🪑 Frankly a folding chair has more charm than any of the characters in this book.They’re so unique and are definitely really funny and don’t ever bog down the scenes with so many characters that you can’t tell who is even talking anymore! They’re all unique and dynamic with character arcs!! Of course! What else would they be?😆And the dragons! 🐉 Oh the dragons! How could I forget about the dragons that are nothing but glorified Uber rides!! They don’t do shit but posture and growl and be boring!Here’s some fun facts about dragons: dragons can choose their tail shape but they can’t choose their color which directly influences their personality and temperament!!All baby dragons are gold because that’s interesting! Is there an evolutionary reason for that or something? Not that we’re told of!More dragon sex is mentioned, thankfully we don’t have to live through the dragon-lust again though!Also the dismounts that Rebecca describes the Riders doing are literally physically impossible!! All the riders should be dead if they try to pull that shit! Giant flying dragons are not horses you can’t just walk around on it while it’s diving and jump off of it😭😭Oh and Anadarna also is now like a super special purple/chameleon never before seen breed of dragon with the rarest tail shape!🐲 Are we surprised? No. Just bored. 😴She also now has like a disabled/malformed wing. Her wings were fine in the first book, but now they’re not? Idk. I feel like that should have been a thing in book one but whatever. (Tairn literally blames it on Violet which is sort of hilariously fucked up??) But anyway she obviously can still fly because god forbid a disability ever hinder a character in anyway that makes them adapt, but she can’t ever hold a rider? Violet is like 90 pounds as we are so graciously reminded so I feel like if Andarna gets bigger she definitely should be able to carry her but whatever. 🤷\u200d♀️TLDR: the dragons are BORING. And they’re not even funny or cool or even scary. Why write about dragons if you make them boring and insignificant to the plot??! And Andarna is a special-special because of course she is. 🤪This review is getting way too long so let’s just talk about the ending.Oh no! Violet’s mom that got no real development or anything died! Anyway. 🧐Why the fuck did the revolution refuse to help Navarre? They claim to be morally superior and to care about the lives of civilians but just blatantly ignore like 50% of the continent’s population because they’re Navarre citizens? And we’re supposed to root for them? Right! Awesome! Okay!😆👍What are the actual morals of the revolution? What is their end goal? Why did Violet join them so quickly without asking any questions??🫠She’s so intelligent!🤓I’m completely fine with Xaden becoming Venin, though I doubt it will be resolved in an interesting way. Though I don’t think it’s really an interesting plot twist and I saw it coming a mile away after all the boring Venin info dumping I had to sit through, but at least it’s something.HOWEVER I CANNOT FORGIVE IT FOR MAKING THE FINAL LINES OF THE BOOK“Welcome to our fucked-up family. Guess we’re brothers now.”THE SECOND TO LAST LINE IN THE BOOK IS “WELCOME TO OUR FUCKED UP FAMILY”😭😭😭😭😭WHAT WHAT WHATDO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT DID TO ME??I READ 634 PAGES OF THE WORST, MEANDERING, BULLSHIT PLOT POINTS, HORRIFIC AND BORING SEX SCENES, INDECIPHERABLE INFO DUMPS, NONSENSICAL MAGIC SYSTEMS, FLAT CHARACTERS, BORING DRAGONS, HORRIBLE REPRESENTATION, AGGRESSIVELY UNFUNNY FRAT BOY HUMOR, UNEDITED GARBAGE AND YOU END IT WITH “WELCOME TO OUR FUCKED UP FAMILY”???????????????!!!!!!!!!!!?!?!?!!?!??!ARE YOU TRYING TO GIVE ME A JOKER ARC??? WAS THAT THE POINT OF THIS BOOK????AM I SUPPOSED TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY AS AN ACTUAL FANTASY BOOK???THE REASON THIS BOOK TOOK ME SO LONG TO REVIEW IS BECAUSE I GOT ACTUAL PSYCHIC DAMAGE FROM THE LAST LINES OF THIS BOOK.I HYPERVENTILATED I THREW MY PHONE I SCREAMED I STARED AT A WALL AND CONTEMPLATED MY PLACE AND PURPOSE ON THIS EARTHI HAD MORE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT THAN ANY CHARACTER IN THIS ENTIRE BOOK IN THE 0.5 SECONDS AFTER READING THOSE LINESHOW AM I SUPPOSED TO REACT TO THAT??DID YARROS THINK SHE ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING WITH THAT ENDING??HAVE I LOST MY MIND?? PEOPLE LIKE THIS BOOK? PEOPLE TAKE IT SERIOUSLY AND MAKE UP THEORIES FOR IT??? WHAT??????GENUINELY IF YOU LIKE THIS BOOK WHY? WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? ARE YOU OKAY? DO YOU NEED HELP?WELCOME TO OUR FUCKED UP FAMILY??? GUESS WE’RE BROTHERS NOW???YARROS I AM LIVING IN YOUR WALLS WHAT DO YOU MEAN WELCOME TO OUR FUCKED UP FAMILY WHAT DO YOU MEAN😭😭😭😭😭😭I FEEL LIKE I AM ENTITLED TO FINANCIAL COMPENSATION FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL DAMAGE THIS BOOK HAS INFLICTED UPON MEso thanks for reading my review <3 I hope this helps your decision making process when it comes to buying books :) (don’t buy this book) Yarros did not receive any financial compensation for my suffering and I highly recommend that if you want to read this book (for some reason??? Why?? I spent so long writing this to give you reasons not to!😭) you get it from your library or literally any other means.Red Tower and Yarros are not people that deserve your hard earned money or support.Also whoever the fuck claimed to have edited this book is a world class scammer because they got paid for doing literally nothing. But also they should be fired and exiled and never allowed to look at words again.I have more to say but I hit the word limit💀'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Because love, at its root, is hope.

That shit is harder to kill than a dragon.Well, fuck🥲That being said, I promised myself I'd finish my current readings before starting this one, but FoMo was a bitch and then, would you believe that, I tripped and fell into Xadaddy's arms.Silly, clumsy me.Iron Flame was alright, but I'm not crazy about it.I found the writing even more YAish than it was in Fourth Wing and I, painfully, have to admit I feel the same about the romance.I don't know if maybe, when I first read Fourth Wing, I was in a place, mentally speaking, where my reader needs were more than met despite the flaws, but it seems like I can't overlook them with the sequel.Being completely honest, the plot does pick up after the first half and the romance has its up and downs all through the story, but it never reaches the point where I felt like giving up on it completely.The smut was fine and the tension well written, but I'm not a fan of Yarros's idea of spicy dialogues.The one liners, sometimes, made me cringe a little, and the characterization of the main characters left me a tad confused, at times, especially at the beginning. I couldn't follow the story properly because I felt like Violet was thinking one thing then acting in a completely opposite way.Speaking of Violet...When I read FW, I thought Yarros'd made her a bit of a Mary Sue, but that was okay, because she had obvious flaws, even she was aware of, to balance her randomly having every special skill on the menu and succeding in every single task she was burdened with.Iron Flame Violet is a total badass and she's definitely grown a lot, but she also feels a little incomplete and rough at the edges. I don't know if it's intentional and/or tied to her future evolution, but I wouldn't have minded her being more confident, especially when it comes to her relationship with Xaden.Xaden is still daddy, in case you're asking, and he was a total dreamboat, the ultimate book boyfriend from start to finish.Like I've mentioned before, I wasn't really sure about the romance, at first. I wanted more grovelling and Violet's constant thirsting over Xaden's fine behind gave me a headache. It gave me major early Tory/Darius vibes, and if you're a fan of Zodiac Academy, you'll get what I mean.Thankfully, things took a pleasant turn when I reached the second part and I wasn't only rooting for them, I was absolutely feral when everything mined their eventual happiness.This works for the plot as well. In the first half, I wasn't really enjoying myself and could count on one hand the moments I actually found interesting.But then shit hit the fan, twists started piling up and every page turned was an angsty fest I totally wanted to attend. I devoured the second half in hours and when I reached the end, just felt like staring at the wall.And have a mojito or two.I definitely didn't see THAT coming.Another thing I really appreciated, aside from the chef's kiss perfect action scenes and THE SASSY DRAGONS (omg my baby Andarna!!!), were the secondary characers. Violet and Xaden's friends deserve their own books - Rhi in particular <3<3<3< - and I definitely hope the sequels will focus on them more, especially because some characters are only now starting to blossom and they seem particularly interesting.I also would like to take advantage of this topic to admit I never really hated Dain. I'm pretty passive when it comes to him, but I swear to god, if RY takesthatdirection, I'm gonna throw a fit.Overall, this was, for me, a decent sequel, albeit an unnecessarily long one.If you loved FW but are having trouble with it like I did, I recommend pushing through it.All in all, it's pretty worth it.I'll leave under the spoiler tag some sort of disclaimer because, even though I usually try my best to stay clear of any kind of drama and hate brining real life politics into my bookish heaven, I've been harassed for a couple days both in public and in private because of my choice to give this book a chance, so for the first and last time in my permanence here on this site, I'll go out of my usual way and discuss things I usually never discuss on GR, after all.I'm aware of the controversy surrounding this author and this book series.I'm not ignoring the problem, I'm simply choosing to keep my thoughts on the matter private and my general beliefs silent, except for serious situations that require me to speak up about them out loud or environments where I know judgement or opposition would come in a respectful manner and not in the form of bullying and name calling.Unfortunately, that doesn't always seem to be the case here on GR, these days.I'm publicly choosing to read this book acknowledging what's going on behind the scenes, and my review will simply be that: an objective and honest book review like the hundreds I've written before, as my hobby and favorite pastime.It won't nor shouldn't be my opinion telling others what they can or can't, should or shouldn't read in their free time and how to use their money or to consume the media they purchased.If I had that type of influence, I most certainly wouldn't be spending my spare moments reviewing books for free.Iam choosing, for myself, to leave a review that has nothing to do with the person who wrote this book or her political views, and it's between me, my objectivity and my conscience to decide how this will play out.I don't need to state this, but before anyone starts throwing around terms and essays, my support and prayers go out to people who are suffering. I chose to do something about the delicate and important matters we're discussing (and those conflicts and natural catastrophes I rarely see discussed here, because, guess what? 1) it's GoodREADS not GoodWORLDWIDENEWS and 2) the world sucks everywhere and it's been sucking for a really long time), but you won't hear me being vocal about it, because I've learnt you don't have to boast about your actions and contributions to be a good person. That sometimes those who are lousy and loud with words, just like the idea of being good without really acting on it.I'm choosing to help whoever I feel needs helping in a way that's suited to my personal beliefs and that has nothing to do with the books I prefer to engage with.I'm choosing to remain neutral when it comes to sharing political views on a site dedicated to book tracking; war and death are a reality I'll never turn away from.And if separating art from the artist isn't a tolerated choice, I hope keeping my private life and my reader life separate will be more understandable.I hope those who disagree with my choice to refrain from sharing my political views, will give me the benefit of the doubt, as I'll try to do with them and their ideals.If you wanna talk politics or discuss what an author has or hasn't done, my comment section isn't the place.

Not that this one wasn\'t great, but it didn\'t give the same feelings as the first one did when it hooked me instantly because of the Parapet scene.Many things didn\'t work for me.The start of this book wasn\'t as exciting... (she was eating freaking biscuits). And Brennan\'s revealation and all were just so avg and boring? A lot of info dumps too. The Dragons made this book better.The first 30% of this book is filled with \'You don\'t trust me enough\' drama between Xaden and Vi, which was seriously getting on my nerves.I get that she\'s hurt, but she was being absolutely ridiculous, demanding info while withholding it as a form of retaliation. Her inner monologue about being a \'bad friend\' and always \'feeling guilty\' for lying again and again was constantly on repeat. NO ACTION NOTHING NADA. I felt bad for Rhiannon as she tried again and again and always checked up on her. Rhiannon deserved better! 😭🔪SPOILERS:🔪So, I\'ll start with my fav,—TAIRN CARRIED THIS WHOLE BOOK. PERIOD.

This freaking drama grated on my nerves, and I was tired of how much this phrase was used. LIKE STOP? Everybody knew that Xaden is not sharing everything just to protect her life, and to a certain extent, I understand Violet, and I agree with her.but she\'s being so immature and whiny, and I swear this book just kind of ruined her character in many ways because she was always back to this old topic, and they constantly fought each other, and Violet constantly defied Xaden again and again (as in risking her life) and then made up eventually.The author really tried to put angst into their story with smut, but tbh I DO NOT PREFER THEM AS A COUPLE (at least not rn). The love was too quick, and the amount of trust issues, insecurities, and fights they had was so wrong and unhealthy. Xaden was being protective of her and hiding truths from her for her OWN SAFETY! and saying from experience, fantasy girlies do not like overprotective bfs. AND ADDING CATRIONA IN IT? That was the worst! The whole ex-jealousy thing was insane. and if this keeps going on, I don\'t think XadenVi will be the endgame (there are 5 books ffs)• side characters:For me,Rhiannonstole the show. She\'s so mature and amazing? and I love her sm! How she kept calm and been patient and supported Violet, and she\'s so damn skillful? SHE DESERVED APPRECIATION AND I\'M GLAD SHE GOT IT.

I knew and already predicted what he would say, and it turned out I was correct!

I low-key ship him and Violet together hhahahaha and pls no sloaneAaric.Sloanewas seriously just different than Liam lol! I expected too much, but she was not that important in this book besides Violet constantly checking up on her.

I\'m glad his character got recognized a lot in this book!Varrishsoooo weirddd sooo creepyyyyy! 👺 I hated him so much and what he did with Violet? HE DESERVED A PAINFUL DEATH WTH!

I read many times and I came with a seizure because why are they even added? A second reread would help, but I won\'t go there anytime soon. A lot of elements of this book were so weird that I prefer book 1 A LOT!what the actual fuckery?(the ending ofcourse)I can finally sleep now as I haven\'t slept more than 5 hours just to finish this book.I\'m sorry but I didn\'t know about this author being zionist when I read this book and I didnt contribute to her financially and all as I read the pirated version.

This was incredibly disappointing...I don’t even really know where to start with this review, because I feel like I have so many complaints.First and foremost, let’s start with one of the book’s most glaring issues: the writing was genuinelybad. It’s as plain and simple as that. This whole thing dragged like crazy and I was just so bored most of the time. Not only that, the writing was also painfully shallow. Nothing and no one had depth: all of the characters were completely one-dimensional and the plot failed to be interesting or engaging in any way.Speaking of the characters, let’s go on with my complaints by talking about our failure of a main character. I don’t know what happened to Violet between this one and the previous book, but I don’t recognize her whatsoever. She used to be the perfect balance of kind and bad-ass with a clever and sharp mind to boot! But now this girl we all knew and loved disappeared completely and instead we got this whiny, insecure idiot without a single rational thought going on inside that annoying brain of hers. I suddenly couldn’t stand her anymore!Same goes for Xaden: he suffered from major character assassination as well. He used to be strong, smart, mysterious, intriguing, and swoony as hell, but that was all gone now. Xaden turned into the most flat character ever, and he had no depth whatsoever. He truly felt like a robot to me, and I lost all interest in him. He is gone for most of the book, and at first I really missed his presence, but after a while, I was just bored every time he came on page, because I knew he would be the same repetitive and annoying character he was during all his other scenes, so I kind of didn’t care anymore if he was gone or not.The fact that both Violet and Xaden turned into insufferable characters is probably a big reason as to why their romance was terrible in this book too. First of all, after the end of the first book Ineededto get some groveling from Xaden, but did we get that here? No. Not even for a second. Xaden wasn’t sorry, he wasn’t regretful, he wasn’t trying to earn back Violet’s trust. No. He didn’t do anything. He didn’t even fight for Violet to forgive him. He was just... waiting. Not lifting a single finger to get back the woman he supposedly loves. He was so cocky in knowing that Violet would crawl back to him anyway that he refused to do anything to speed up the process. He just waited. And I guess he was right, because our spine-less heroine did indeed take him back without getting anything in return: no promises, no trust. Just nothing.Which obviously leads to a very unhealthy relationship between them where they don’t trust each other and in which they refuse to communicate. EVER. All they do is be horny and have sex, but they never actually talk anymore. They don’t confide in each other and neither do they let themselves fully open up to the other. Their entire relationship was just shallow, boring and irritating. I no longer liked anything about it. And then we even got some goddamn other woman drama, and my patience just vanished! I hated it.Now, when it comes to the side characters I don’t even know where to begin, because I feel like none of them were written well or with any depth to them. It’s like the author could never seem to focus on more than a few characters at the same time, so whenever she wanted to pay attention to one side character, all the other side characters just fell away. For example: at the beginning of this book we have quite a lot of focus on Imogen, and I was really seeing some amazing progress between her and Violet. I thought I saw the start of a beautiful friendship forming between them. But then, the moment Rhiannon started coming back into the fold (after being ignored in the first part), Imogen completely fell away again and her relationship with Violet never picked up. It’s like the author couldn’t handle Violet having more than one close female friend; she couldn’t focus on both at the same time. And therefore, neither Imogen or Rhiannon ever truly felt like friends to Violet because they were often suddenly ignored in her inner monologue or in the story. They were more like decoration, like tools to further the story along. Thus, none of Violet’s friends ever feel like real characters on their own..I loved the dragons in the first book; they were my favourite part of the entire book. But now, I couldn’t care less. Tairn used to be this sassy, grumpy dad-type, but now he was just a flat, monotone character with no real personality. Everything he said was repetitive, and his entire character just seemed way too simple and lacking any sort of depth. When it came to Andarna, I genuinely think her entire character was butchered. She used to be this cute and precious little baby, and now she turned into someone annoying, bitchy and arrogant without any meaningful connection to Violet. She was like an entitled teenager, and there’s a reason why nobody likes those.Of course, there were also other characters of whom I was really looking forward to seeing their story develop, but I didn’t get anything remotely satisfying when it came to them. Liam’s sister was only in a few scenes and in most of them she was just flat-out exasperating; everything about her character was anti-climactic.More importantly however, I feel like Dain just got completely ignored during this entire book. He used to be Violet’s best friend for such a long time and after it is revealed he didn’t even really do anything to betray her, Violet doesn’t remotely seem to care?? She doesn’t think about him and she doesn’t give him the time of day... she sort of forgives him but not really?? It was so weakly developed and I honestly expected more. It was, once again, very anti-climactic.Long story short, the only reason I somewhat enjoyed this book, and why I even finished it, is because I still felt a semblance of attachment to the story and these characters after book one, but even that wasn’t enough to keep me engaged for long enough. I couldn’t help but skim near the end of this book, because I was just so bored. I genuinely didn’t care anymore, and this book was just way too long for no reason.

Yet it was so enjoyable and exciting. I loved it in all its imperfections. Xaden and Violet have my heart and the series seems to be getting darker and more powerful. But oh how I ate it all up 🤭Was it better than Fourth Wing?The plot certainly was better but I do think people will find its execution a bit messy in general.Is it binge worthy?Absolutely, you just need time.So A LOT happens in this one, in fact way more than the first book.This book is so action packed and relationship focused, I didn\'t think I could love this series more but I really do.The best part about this was Tairn and Andarna. No one can tell me otherwise. I came in to love Xaden and Violet but the dragons... AHHHH 😩😩❤The book picks up immediately after the events of Fourth Wing and with no time wasted we jump into the story. Iliked the addition of new charactersand the way they all had their own personalities yet never overpowering.Felixand his sarcastic arse was top notch. I liked how he kept things real. I do believe the transition ofSolane\'sissues with Violet could have been smoothened a bit considering how strong she came to be. I absolutely LOATHEDVarrish.He\'s the equivalent of Umbridge I swear. Hated, hated, hated him. Those who have read Fourth Wing know, am not mentioning one of the characters, but I\'ll just say- his dynamic with Violet was chef\'s kiss 🤌""I want you exactly how you are, emotions and all. I want the woman I fell for...""🩶I lovedXadenand Violet.The groveling and reassurance THROUGHOUT the book was everything!!So we all know how things were left in Fourth Wing, and I expected Xaden to grovel his way for a few pages but our girl Violet made him grovel the whole time and I LOVED it. He was patient with her, he took his time with her. He made mistakes in this one too but he owned up to it and gave her answers.❤️\u200d🔥She had 100 questions? He answered them all. She asked the same question a million times? He answered it each and every damn time. Someone tried to make her jealous? He confidently claimed and assured her every time. Yeah, exactly! That\'s the kind of man he is 🤭😌⚡I adoredVioletin this. Let\'s be honest, there will be a lot of people who will find her annoying and insecure in this one. I personally did not. To me it made sense. Everyone lied to her throughout her whole life. Almost every new person wants to kill her. She lost someone very close to her. Her issues with Cat although wasn\'t really necessary but made sense. It gave Xaden and Violet the opportunity to become confident in each other and gave the opportunity to trust each other again. I loved Violet was patient and open towards Xaden, well eventually 🤭🐉Now let\'s get tomy babies- Tairn and Andarna.Y\'all if you adored them in the last book? You will LOVE them in this. Tairn was his sarcastic self, caring self and always giving his Silver One wisdom. I absolutely LOVED Andarna. Her adolescent self was so snarky, it was adorable. I wanted to protect them both, and especially my baby Andarna. Her reveals(Yes, multiple reveals 👀)had me gasping. I can\'t wait to see what else is in store for them.🔥Theside characters- Ridoc, Sawyer, Imogen and Rhiwere such good friends. The way they supported Violet through thick and thin. They had each other\'s backs. Sawyer and Jesina? They\'ll be cute together if it happens 🤭 These four kept me laughing. They made the two main characters real and brought life to the book. B and Mira 🫡🤡Dain and Cat-Bro now idk what to think about them 😭😩 It feels weird.

The romantic will they/won\'t they mostly played out inFourth Wing(of course they will) so having to sit through loads of faux love angst about ""oh, Xaden, how can I know you? How can I trust you?

Not to mention the fact that Yarros\' smutty talk is kinda cringe.I was so so close to skimming during the first half BUT I have to say I thought the book went on to redeem itself a lot in the second half.The politics and magic of this world are surprisingly quite interesting when they manage to rear their head in between Violet and Xaden\'s theatrics. Yarros developed side characters further and I really came to love the camaraderie between Violet, Rhi, Sawyer and Ridoc, as well as the developing relationships and tensions with new characters. I love the voices of the dragons. I enjoyed Varrish as a villain (one of the few things I did enjoy about the first half.)When we reached the battles at the climax of the novel, I couldn\'t look away. The action scenes were suspenseful and dramatic and the ending, though a bit predictable, made me actually interested in reading the next book.I admit I was shocked to discover three more books are planned.

I\'m going to need a moment to process all this.Many moments later...Right, onto my thoughts.Allow me a second to gush here. I love it when a book knows what it\'s there to do, and that is to entertain the reader. It isn\'t there to be slow or boring or god forbid, pretentious (shudders). Rather, its goal is to squeeze every ounce of joy and delight out of the pages, and that\'s what this series does best.Cracking open the first page, I was sucked right back into the world of Navarre and Violet Sorrengail. It\'s as if I\'ve never left it. Everything I loved from the first book is here—nonstop action, characters I could root for, snarky dragons, and sizzling romance. I couldn\'t turn the pages fast enough.The only thing I didn\'t love was our main couple having squabbles for half the book over reasons I couldn\'t make heads or tails of. I get that Rebecca Yarros has to inject some sort of strife between them to keep things interesting, but I was just confused. But if it\'s that or hundreds of pages of lovey-dovey mush, I guess I\'ll take confounding couple problems any day.I always have a sliver of trepidation going into book 2 of a series. What if my enjoyment of the first book was a fluke, a figment of my imagination? Or that the author somehow found the magical formula once, but can\'t reproduce it again? Or worse, that there\'s no interesting story left to tell? But I needn\'t worry becauseIron Flamecontains all the magic of its predecessor.I will say though, going in, the length at more than 600 pages was a bit daunting. But once I started, it didn\'t even matter. I was riveted throughout. It felt like every single page served a purpose—except for the aforementioned confounding couple problems—building momentum and eventually hurtling towards a stunning conclusion. Honestly, if there were another 600 pages, I\'d happily gobble those up too.Before this book, I admit I was a bit puzzled that there could be five books in this series, like how much more is there to this story? But seeing the way Yarros has built out the universe and the war in this book, and especially that ending, I get now how there could be so much more to this. And I\'m glad. I\'m not sure I\'m ready to say goodbye to Navarre any time soon, so I\'m happy there are still a few more books to come. I just hope the wait isn\'t too long.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:#1.Fourth Wing~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""1 StarAlright, I'm not going to rant or be very specific in this review because I know many people are still currently reading the book.

I don’t understand how an author can go from writing a captivating world with a fun magic system, an incredible enemies to lovers dynamic, & well-written, fleshed out characters… to completely dismantling every aspect of that in a single book. I can not stress enough how painful this was to get through. I was tempted several times to dnf and simply pretend it doesn’t exist.the main characters in this were absolutely infuriating. they both became the worst possible versions of themselves and it made their relationship completely insufferable. they went from being one of my favorite book couples, to me not caring whether they even lived to see the end of the book.the entire story was so rushed through that I was getting whiplash. the plot of this one book could’ve been spread across the next three books. she needs to slow down the story, because rushing through the plot devalues everything.throwing in plot twists every other chapter for shock value does not make a book better, especially considering most of these plot twists were clearly not planned out. it just feels exhausting.rebecca yarros needs to seriously reevaluate her long-term plan if she wants to restore the integrity of this series (if possible at this rate). the remaining 3 books need to be properly researched, thoroughly thought out, and most importantly: NOT rushed for the sake of popularity.and it probably wouldn’t hurt to fire whoever her editor is (if said editor exists)two stars for a three star read. yes, i’m knocking an additional star off for this being my most highly anticipated read for the back half of the year, and then it having the absolute audacity to be one of the worst books i’ve ever read.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3 - ⭐️⭐️⭐️Overall,Iron Flamewas okay.Parts I\'ve enjoyed and parts I found myself skimming through the pages. It was littered with fillers.My favorite parts were mostly the action scenes and the dragon scenes.I wasn\'t a big fan of the development of the romance in this one, there were tender and hot moments but that still didn\'t make up for how the relationship seemed to go in circles rather than grow. Maybe that\'s because Xaden\'s development was.....meh? Not that Violet\'s development was any better.I absolutely loved the tension between Violet and Xaden in Fourth Wing, but once the relationship passes that phase it\'s tricky for authors to keep it interesting and it certainly fell short in this sequel.I don\'t know if I\'m the only one who feels this way but this book was heavy in dialogue and information dump and that\'s why it felt like it was dragging..The drama between some of the characters had me roll my eyes because most of it was so unnecessary we could be doing other far more interesting things than this.I\'ll just highlight a few spoilers below to get some points across so beware..............[Iron Flame Spoilers Ahead].............First of all, the jealous ex trope should be on every author\'s list of banned tropes. It always results in unnecessary drama and tension between the couple that I do not need especially when they have far more important issues they need to resolve between them. Imighttolerate it if they weren\'t an established couple, but if they are then that\'s a big no no for me.I wanted to throw my kindle at the wall. It\'s just frustrating to read about.And speaking of Violet and Xaden\'s relationship, dancing around the whole ""trust"" issue while still hiding things from each other simply because the other didn\'t bother to ""ask"" was annoying and did not add anything to their relationship but to create unnecessary tension. Did Xaden actuallyworkfor earning back Violet\'s trust or was he just waiting around for whenever the time was convenient? And Violet\'s judgement and choices were often clouded by her longing and lust for Xaden.Still I found some of their scenes tender and sexy but it definitely is less appealing to me than it was in Fourth Wing. Their relationship has less substance now.Because of how lukewarm my emotions were throughout most of the book, the ending did not gut me as much.These thoughts reflect my own experience while reading this book.'}]"

Y digo mal llamada porque no es una serie de seis novelas sino una única novela editada en seis entregas. McDowell imitó a los grandes del XIX que publicaba sus novelas por partes en los periódicos y lo adaptó a los tiempos actuales editándola en tamaño bolsillo. Su intención como la de aquellos a los que imitó fue llegar a todo tipo de público más allá de su poder adquisitivo. Muy loable por su parte.Los habitantes de Perdido intentan recuperarse de las consecuencias de la riada. Las pérdidas materiales y económicas han sido cuantiosas y el pueblo tiene claro que no puede permitirse otra inundación, por ello contratan la construcción de un dique que los aísle de las crecidas del Perdido y del Blackwater. Más o menos esta es la parte que se desarrolla en ""El dique"".En esta segunda entrega, McDowell se centra en la profundización de los personajes y sus relaciones entre ellos. Si en ""La riada"", algunos quedaron solo esbozados, en esta, la construcción es impecable. Elinor, que sigue siendo el eje central, le cede parte del protagonismo a Mary Love y a Sister. Aparecen, igualmente, nuevos personajes como Early y Queenie. Miriam y Frances, las dos hijas de Elinor, aparecerán desarrolladas en la siguiente de la serie.El estilo sigue siendo el mismo. Prosa directa, diálogos atractivos y la maestría que le caracteriza a la hora de dosificar información e intriga. El ritmo es algo más pausado que en la anterior, pero no por ello deja de enganchar. En mi caso fue empezarla y no poderla soltar. En el momento de escribir esta reseña ya he comenzado la tercera.Vamos a encontrarnos con menos presencia de lo paranormal que en la anterior, pero la única escena de terror con que nos obsequia McDowell me puso los pelos de punta.Final nuevamente a cuchillo por las razones que comenté al principio. Menos mal que no nos hacen esperar mucho entre cada entrega.En conclusión. Una saga con el sello de McDowell. Trama de la que aún queda mucho por saber, buena ambientación y mejores personajes. Recomendable.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '""Perdido miró a su alrededor, contempló lo que se había construido y, de repente, pareció ver el dique con ojos extraños: era como si una serpiente inmensa, inconcebible, hubiera salido deslizándose del bosque de pinos y se hubiera enroscado alrededor del pueblo, y ahora yaciera dormida, protectora involuntaria de quienes ahora vivían a su sombra."" 🖤🔝Vamos con la segunda entrega de la novela dividida en seis partes, Blackwater; El Dique 🫀🔪Si ya el primero me gustó, en esta segunda parte, si bien es más pausada y he sentido menos el elemento sobrenatural, lo cierto es que me tienen conquistada.Ya siento que formo parte de ese pueblo y sus gentes. Ya tenemos toda la situación y personajes bien presentados, ahora toca ir descubriendo muy poco a poco sus secretos. Conoceremos nuevos personajes, como el ingeniero encargado de la construcción del dique; Early Haskew, y profundizaremos más en la psique de otros como Sister o Queenie Strickland, la cuñada de James.La amalgama de géneros de estos libros me tiene completamente enamorada. Esa mezcla de costumbrismo sureño aderezado con un misterio por desvelar, en el que parece que no pasa nada, pero pasa y mucho. Cuando menos te lo esperas, deja de lado el tono costumbrista y te deja con la boca abierta con pasajes absolutamente aterradores, sangrientos y muy gráficos.Cada entrega consta de la misma extensión; unas 250 páginas en las que McDowell se toma su tiempo para relatarnos el día a día de sus habitantes, incluidos sus rencillas y dramas.Seguimos en el pueblo de Perdido, Alabama, unos años después de lo acontecido en el anterior y poco a poco el pueblo se va recuperando del desastre de la riada.Comienzan las obras de un gran dique que sea capaz de contener las aguas tanto del río Perdido como el Blackwater, y así evitar daños a la población, a pesar de las reticencias iniciales de Elinor a que se lleven a cabo.Una serie de problemas e imprevistos harán retrasar las obras de algunos tramos del dique, lo que hará que Elinor tome algunas cartas inesperadas en el asunto...Como era de esperar, nada parará la construcción de lo que promete ser un símbolo para la prosperidad y salvación del pueblo.Por si todo esto no fuera suficiente, McDowell hace un retrato fantástico y muy bien detallado de la sociedad de la época, poniendo especial énfasis en la esclavitud, también a las relaciones matrimoniales, así como al negocio maderero, recuerden que los aserraderos son la principal fuente de ingresos del lugar.✝️""Señor, protégenos de las inundaciones, del fuego, de los animales rabiosos y de los negros fugitivos.""Este es un extracto de una conversación que tienen antes de una comida Mary-Love y Sister Caskey, reflejando así su imponente papel de supremacía de los blancos adinerados sobre los negros esclavos.✨ Todo ello me encanta; las cuidadas ediciones, los detalles del plano de Perdido que nos encontramos al comienzo, y en el que van añadiendo los cambios y bajas ocurridas al igual que en el árbol genealógico, lo que nos ayuda mucho a situarnos en la historia 👌🏻🖤¡¡Ayyy!!

Es una historia muy única y este segundo tomo está a la altura del primero en ese sentido.Gran libro, quiero el tercero ya.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '""When I am dead - whether there\'s a levee or not, this town and everybody in it will be washed off the face of the earth...""4.25 🌟\'sInitial ThoughtsOriginally published in the 1980s as six serial novels, Michael McDowell\'s Blackwater saga was later published as one complete collection. After really enjoying the first installment (The Flood) last month, I decided to break them up and aim for one a month rather binge the lot in one go. Keeping with the spirit with which they were originally released.First impression is thatthis series really is the pinnacle of southern gothic horror. Set in the early 1900s, the story focuses on the theCaskey family, who are amongst the ""elite"" in the town ofPerdido. But life for them takes a strange twist whenOscar Caskeyfinds a mysterious woman namedElinor Dammert, who is stranded in the Osceola Hotel. It\'s almost completely submerged due to a catastrophic flood, along with the rest of Perdido.""The young members of Perdido\'s population led a charmed life. But the river took its sacrifices frequently, and sometimes the bodies were recovered by a fisherman far downstream.""The fact that Elinor, doesn\'t appear to have any history or paperwork to support her identity doesn\'t seem to matter to Oscar. Not enough to stop him falling in love and marrying her against the wishes of the family matriarch,Mary-Love. What is it with redheaded women? But her charms don\'t appear to work on old Mary, although even she doesn\'t suspect just how strange a creature the young woman really is. There may just be a little bit of a monster lurking under the pretty exterior of Elinor Dammert. A battle for supremacy is on the cards in this ghoulish soap opera as we continue with the second installment...The Levee.The StoryThe town has just recovered from all the disaster that came with a huge flood and, as the rich usually do, the Caskey family are doing quite well out of buying up all the land. As the title of this one suggests the town begins to build a huge levee to prevent any such future natural disasters from wreaking havoc. And for those wondering what a levee is, it\'s a barricade that prevents a body of water flooding the surrounding land. You learn something every day.But for some reason Elinor is not quite onboard with her husband\'s plan to future proof the town and safeguard the family business. Could it be her strange affinity with that muddy Perdido river? The river that runs the exact same colour as her red locks? There\'s loads of family drama in store for you in this one, wether it\'s horrific accidents or strange illnesses, for you to sink your teeth into. Plus a dash of the scary stuff just in case you were forgetting this one was a horror.Final ThoughtsSo the second book in the series down and I\'m getting the feeling this is no ordinary horror novel. In fact it\'s one of superior quality. The focus is certainly not the supernatural aspects, but the dynamics at play amongst the inhabitants of Perdido and first aid foremost the Caskey family itself. Elinor has begun to really assert herself and is certainly an expert at getting what she wants from Oscar, although she\'s not having it all her own way due to the cunning of Mary-Love.""Ain\'t no house that\'s empty. something always moving in. You just got to make sure it\'s people that gets in there first.""So yes, despite this being labelled a horror McDowell is not going all out to scare his reader here. Although there are some very gruesome deaths to satisfy those who are looking for that kind of thing, for the most it\'s all very subtle. The author being more intent on wrapping his reader up in the drama. That\'s why I would recommend this one for readers looking for a more literary style of horror. Just don\'t go in expecting none stop gore.Although not quite as entertaining as the first book, it was still a gripping read. There\'s mystery, horror, suspense and a bucket load of drama. It really does have a little bit of everything. It is very character driven so for readers who love fascinating personalities and the conflict between them then you\'re going to be right at home here. I\'ve said it many times before but McDowell\'s use of dialogue is exceptional and it\'s almost flawless here. Brought to life by his amazingly eloquent and articulate prose.So my advice is you need to check this out yourself. So join me in reading this fantastic series. Next up...The House.Thanks for reading and...cheers!'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Me tiene fascinada y enganchadísima esta saga 😍😍.“Mientras Perdido se recupera de la inundación propone la construcción de un dique que impida una nueva catástrofe.

Como por ejemplo, el ingeniero encargado de la construcción del dique.

Y es que esta, si no en la superficie, sí en lo profundo, es una sociedad matriarcal en la que ellas llevan las riendas. Además de estas dos mujeres, hay otras que cada vez van teniendo más importancia. Especialmente me ha gustado el papel de una de ellas, a la sombra en el primer libro, que por fin ha espabilado, de lo cual me he alegrado mucho.

Estoy completamente enamorada del detalle, del relieve y los colores.En esta segunda parte, la historia se vuelve más turbia y nos adentramos más en los secretos y entresijos de los habitantes del lugar y de su río.PUNTOS POSITIVOS-El primer libro me gustó pero este lo he disfrutado muchísimo más. Creo que es más oscuro y hay cositas que son bastante inquietantes.-Se dice que hay menos toques sobrenaturales o de terror de lo que venden al publicitar el libro, pero...¿qué hay más terrorífico que un drama familiar? fuera bromas, el drama está muy presente y es una parte fundamental del libro pero hay mucho más.-En el primer libro hay algún que otro toque sobrenatural, pero en esta segunda parte, estos elementos destacan un poco más y he visto un aura de misticismo bastante más potente que en la primera parte.-Sigo diciendo que esta historia tiene muchos toques Lovecraftianos y si te gusta el estilo de Stephen King, esta es claramente tu saga.-La lucha de poder entre las dos protagonistas femeninas está en su máximo explendor y es muy divertido ver como se intentan sabotear continuamente.-Hay un personaje que en este libro me lo ha dado todo y ha sido Sister. Creía que iba a ser un personaje más pero para nada ha sido así. Me ha encantado.-Se utiliza el humor negro para criticar temas tan serios como el racismo y funciona muy verdaderamente bien.PUNTOS NEGATIVOS-Lo único que me ha costado un poco más son las partes que hablan del tema del aserradero, de su historia, y su paso de manos y de familia. Se que es bastante importante para la trama pero se me ha hecho un poco aburrido.Pero esto solo ha sido una pequeña parte y no me ha molestado en absoluto ni me ha lastrado la lectura.En conclusión, esta segunda parte ha superado mis expectativas y me ha gustado más que el anterior.

Everyone in town seems to be for it, except for Elinor, who believes that the river won’t let them build it.No one knows or suspects that Elinor isn’t quite human. She is a creature linked inextricably to the river, borne from the fetid black water of the Perdido, and the river demands blood sacrifices now and then.This is a weird series, and I mean that in a good way. McDowell, born and raised in the South, clearly has a kinship with fellow Southern writers like Flannery O’Connor, Carson McCullers, and William Faulkner, all of whom had a vivid and existential love-hate relationship with the South.The best Southern writers all tend to strike a similar chord about the unique nature and, well, personality of the region. The land, the culture, the type of people that choose to live there: all these elements intertwine into a tapestry, which the keenest of regional authors help to weave.McDowell has done that masterfully in his Blackwater series, capturing the hot sultriness of the Alabama country, the psycho-sexual tensions of a post-Reconstruction era, and the insane family dynamics of a wealthy white Southern legacy family.Whether one is Southern or not shouldn’t matter when it comes to appreciating this series.

I smile politely, gazing around the marble hallway. Working here is my last chance to start fresh. I can pretend to be whoever I like. But I’ll soon learn that the Winchesters’ secrets are far more dangerous than my own…Every day I clean the Winchesters’ beautiful house top to bottom. I collect their daughter from school. And I cook a delicious meal for the whole family before heading up to eat alone in my tiny room on the top floor.I try to ignore how Nina makes a mess just to watch me clean it up. How she tells strange lies about her own daughter. And how her husband Andrew seems more broken every day. But as I look into Andrew’s handsome brown eyes, so full of pain, it’s hard not to imagine what it would be like to live Nina’s life. The walk-in closet, the fancy car, the perfect husband.I only try on one of Nina’s pristine white dresses once. Just to see what it’s like. But she soon finds out… and by the time I realize my attic bedroom door only locks from the outside, it’s far too late.But I reassure myself: the Winchesters don’t know who I really am.They don’t know what I’m capable of…An unbelievably twisty read that will have you glued to the pages late into the night.

IYKYK, my reviews are always honest.Writing: idk out of 5 | Plot: ????2???/5 | Ending: 5/5 tbhAfter letting this marinate for a couple of hours, 2 stars is the way to go.THE PLOTMillie is living in Casa Nissan aka her car when she\'s hired as the maid for the Winchesters, a ridiculously wealthy family. She\'s over the moon to have a job and a bed, but she quickly realizes something funky is happening in the home. And she\'s not sure if she\'ll make it out alive... dun dun dunnnnnn!!!!!MY OPINIONHonestly... I\'m confusion. This is how I felt after I readThe Trapped Wifeby Samantha Hayes. On one hand, this was garbagio, on the other hand, it had some things that kept me reading and enjoying myself. It\'s a book I love to hate and hate to love all at once. Ok, let me try to make sense of thoughts:- Millie\'s POV is straight up ""dear diary"" style. As in, ""I spent 7 hours cleaning the house and I thought about Andy Winchester\'s bangin bod the entire time. He is so dreamy. Does he like me too????"" It\'s also giving me ""rages to riches"" fanfic written by a tween vibes. BUT AT THE SAME DAMN TIME... the book was legit funny in parts???? Like great dark humour throughout????- Millie\'s character makes no sense. Not a spoiler—she spends 10 years in jail. Yet she has zero survival skills and seems relatively unbothered by the fact she was locked up for an entire decade. I\'m telling you right now I can\'t last 10 MINUTES in jail unscathed, so a whole ass decade would have me coming out on some Rambo shit.- I did not like Nina. She was over the top, selfish, and illogical. I can\'t feel sorry for what she went through because .... No spoilers.... but if you read it, you\'ll know.- The ""mystery"" is kinda obvious. It\'s likeThe Wife Between Usmixed with... idk,Gone Girl? There wasn\'t really any suspense. You know what\'s gonna happen. From Part II onward I was speed reading like a mf. But I was invested in the whole revenge vibe like ok girl go OFFFFFF.- I gave the ending 5/5 because it\'s women\'s history month and that\'s all I can say without spoiling it- I\'ve readThe Locked Doorby this author and this was a totally different vibe. Good for her for going in a totally different direction with no projection of her medical career/knowledge in the story. I\'m not sure if it worked, but at least the ending was better than Locked Door.I can see people really enjoying this or really hating it. Do not expect this to be a literary masterpiece. You will not be mentally stimulated in any way. This is your standard popcorn thriller but not as annoying as Unmissing, Stay Awake, etc because of the dark humour. This is the type of book you read afterMy Dark Vanessarips your heart out and stomps all over it.PROS AND CONSPros: you\'ll keep reading because you don\'t know if you like it or hate it, awesome dark humour, great endingCons: vapid plot and characters, rags to riches fanfic written by a 14 yo vibes, dear diary ass writing'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '“The Housemaid” by Freida McFadden is just one of those novels that for years to come, I will speak highly of and recommend to anyone that wants an incredible thriller. One that’s also filled with mystery and psychological terror all wrapped together brilliantly. From McFadden’s excellent writing style to all the characters I absolutely loved, this is easily one of the best novels of 2022.It’s a very addictive read that is so hard to put down, you’ll more than likely find yourself reading deep into the night because it’s a genuine page-turner. I loved all the little revelations that pop up here and there on top of an incredible story. Just when you think you have it figured out, this novel turns your world upside down.Don’t worry, I will not go into any specifics or spoil anything for you but I’d consider this a must-read novel. Besides the fantastic pacing, I also loved all the New York references since I’m a New Yorker and it really felt close to home. Thinking back on everything, I can’t tell you how many authentic jaw-dropping moments I had while reading this as this novel completely blew my mind.The ending was beyond satisfying and just something I didn’t expect at all! LoL saying it was a drop-the-mic moment is an understatement. This was a wild, insane, fun, adrenaline-filledthriller that kept me on the edge of my seat. It was a wonderful reading experience as I wish every novel I read was like this!I give “The Housemaid” by Freida McFadden a perfect 5/5 as this is a masterpiece. I’ve read many novels in my life and this is one of the most memorable ones that will forever stand out for me. This novel was unique, exciting, and everything you could ever want in a thriller and then some. It’s a rollercoaster of a read from start to finish and I can honestly say that McFadden has a new reader in me. This was the first novel I’ve read by her and I’m genuinely excited to read more of her work and whatever future novels she writes. She is an amazing author with one incredibly creative and talented mind!'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '3.5 stars — I decided to read another Freida McFadden book because I wanted a page turner that didn’t require much thinking. “The Housemaid” had gotten numerous high reviews so I decided to try it. The book started off very good and had me hooked from the beginning. It tells the story of Millie a recent parolee who is homeless and in need of a job. When she gets hired by Nina and Andrew as a live-in housemaid/nanny she believes she has found her dream job. But soon she realizes that Nina is a very difficult person to work for (think Meryl Streep in “The Devil Wears Prada”). I really enjoyed the interactions between Millie and Nina and her family. I was squarely in the 4.5 to 5 stars range up until the final 30 pages or so of the book. I won’t spoil it but to say the actions of the police, Enzo, Millie and Nina were ridiculous is such an understatement of how bad this book came to a close I can’t describe it. I don’t remember yelling out “No” and “come on” and “really” while reading a book before. (Yes I’m weird) but I had no choice considering the epic plot collapse that left me shaking my head. Even with a full 1 star reduction I enjoyed the book and will have to read the sequel to see if McFadden can return to the form that had me on the edge of my seat for the first 90 percent of the book.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'This book is not as clever as it thinks it is.Everyone is trying to gaslight everyone else and it’s messy.We know next to nothing about Millie for at least 60% of the novel…so why are we supposed to care about her?Millie could make more of an effort with Enzo. Italian to English is right there on your damn phone.Nina’s chapters are bizarre.I’m still not sure what the “big” twist is. There are several reveals, but nothing earth-shattering.This tries to be an upscale version of Minka Kent...or a low-budget version of Sarah Pinborough. But the characters are so thinly developed that the author leaves everything to hinge on plot—a dubious choice, at best.You probably won’t want to put it down. But you will be asking yourself what the hell you just read.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""The plot twist in this book got me good!! I never ever saw it coming🤯. I love how this book started out so creepy and eerie, with Nina behaving so weirdly, and then really escalated in the second half to full-on dangerous. I also love how Millie is so mysterious. We don't know much about her for a huge chunk of the book. It was fun to slowly unravel more of her back story. The only downside to that, though, is that it did take me a little bit to care about Millie because we didn't know a lot about her in the beginning.Overall 4 stars! A fun, fast-paced mystery/thriller. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because I wish there were a few more mini-plot twists sprinkled throughout, but overall, I really enjoyed it and would definitely read the sequel!!""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'This is the dumbest thing I have ever read.

After all the buzzing hype surrounding this book that never seems to diminish, I finally decided it was time to dive in and award myself some entertaining popcorn reading. However, oh boy, this book absolutely deserves every bit of its never-ending hype. It exceeded my expectations, had me gritting my teeth, squirming restlessly in my seat, and, even though I anticipated the delicious twist from the beginning, I still admired how the author perfectly developed this smart cat-and-mouse game. The last third, in particular, was exceptionally brilliant! I knew right from the beginning that I would enjoy this heart-throbbing, jaw-dropping, unputdownable, twisty psychological thriller, but I didn't expect to love it even more and immediately decided to jump into the next book of the series, despite some reviews emphasizing that it might not be as good as the first one. I just couldn't resist spending more time in Millie the maid's disturbing, mind-bending world!Meet Millie: recently released from prison for a crime we don't know if she committed or what kind of crime she got involved in. She's homeless, living in her Nissan, worn down from her latest job at the bar, getting rejected even from burger joints, barely having a chance to start over at her young age (she's in her mid-twenties, a pretty girl, but she disguises her beauty behind glasses and baggy clothes, just in case somebody thinks she's too attractive to be hired). She can't believe her luck when her application as a housemaid at Winchester House (correction: it's a mansion surrounded by a gate with a beautiful landscape) is approved by Nina Winchester: a stay-at-home wife, a bit overweight, dressed only in white, a sophisticated woman who seems friendly at first sight.Millie is introduced to Nina's little girl, who looks like she jumped out of a Children of the Corn movie with her weird baby doll dress, white-blond hair, and spoiled brat attitude that rubs her the wrong way. Then there's the father, the breadwinner of the family, the overly handsome Andrew Winchester, who seems like Prince Charming and whom Millie can barely stop herself from drooling over.Millie doesn't mind that she has to live in the attic, with a room that has the tiniest window that never opens and a lock outside the door that mostly gets stuck. She also keeps herself in check as Nina's emotionally unstable behavior pushes her buttons until they nearly fall to the floor. She can't flip the bird to her unsatisfied, bickering, witchy employer and her irritating, annoying little daughter because if she doesn't get a good reference from her employer, she's forced to live in her car, violating her parole, which could send her back to prison. She keeps her mouth shut, but it's not easy to deal with Nina's mood swings.When she learns a dirty little secret about Nina's past and gets warned by the hot, candy-like landscaper Enzo, who unfortunately speaks only Italian, she realizes that by accepting this job, she may be putting her life in danger. Especially when it's so tempting to get seduced by Mr. Winchester, while his wife watches them like a jealous hawk, ready to tear her limbs apart.

How does this have such a high rating?WHAT TO EXPECT:✨ psychological thriller✨ mystery✨ plot twists✨ TW: infidelity, domestic abuse, torture, toxic relationship, murder, death (this is not a complete list, so be sure to research the trigger warnings before)My Thoughts:What a fucking waste of my time. I am annoyed I read this book and cannot believe it came so highly recommended. There\'s so much I can say but I\'ll keep this review short since I don\'t want to spend more time thinking about this book than I have to.I hardly ever read thrillers yet I was able to predict everything.I honestly wish I DNF\'d but I decided to keep going for the big plot twists that I was told would completely surprise me; but alas, they did not. The author basically tells you what\'s going to happen next by making the narrator have internal dialogue that panders to the reader. Here are a few examples.1. The FMC, Millie, enters the room she will be living in and goes,""There was something about that room that was very scary.""Oooooo, I bet something terrible happened there. *I say this sarcastically*2. Millie meets the gardener and she notices,""There\'s something in his expression that sends a chill down my spine. And then he shakes his head, almost imperceptibly. Almost like he\'s trying to warn me.""And then he tells her it\'s dangerous and she should leave. Huh, I wonder why the gardener would tell a random woman she\'s in danger living in this rich suburban home as the maid. What could possibly go wrong?3. Millie meets the husband and immediately notices how hot he is.""It\'s hard not to notice that he is several levels more attractive than his wife.""And throughout the story she constantly comments on how handsome he is. I wonder what\'s going to happen between the super hot maid and her super hot employer. . .4. Millie\'s bedroom door locks from the outside and she notices there are scratches on the door,""Like somebody was scraping at the door. Trying to get out.""Cue the Cardi-B viral sound ""That\'s suspicious. That\'s weird."" We all know she\'s getting locked in that room at some point.There\'s a lot more but again, I don\'t want to spend more time on this book so, moving on to my next point.The writing was juvenile.Along with the author\'s penchant for pandering to the reader, the book was just so average written. It felt like someone in high school wrote it. Simple writing. Basic characters. Unrealistic development.Millie was an unbearable FMC.She\'s a recently released convict and has had a hard time keeping a job. She\'s desperate, which is why she overlooks all the red flags about this new job as a maid. But for fuck\'s sake, it\'s like she has zero self preservation. I absolutely hated her and the choices she made throughout the story. The only redeeming thing about her was how she handles everything at the end.But that ending has me laughing because of the sheer stupidity of it all.You\'re telling me Millie has been a dud for the entire book but somehow she comes out on top at the end? I don\'t believe it but whatever.Overall, this book was a miss and I do not recommend it. I should be giving this 1 stars because I legit didn’t like anything about it. But it was readable and even if predictable, there was a cohesive plot. . . so I’ll give it 1.5 stars.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Thank you to the publisher and NetGalley for providing me with a copy of this novel for an honest review. It has been published in April 2022.""The Housemaid"" by Freida McFadden was a bit of a disappointment to read.First of all, the tagline ""From behind closed doors, she sees everything"" must have been chosen by someone who never read the book, because it couldn\'t be farther from the truth: Millie goes through the novel blissfully unaware of everything that happens around her, be it behind closed doors or not. Even the most telegraphed plot twists somehow catch her by surprise, despite all the warning signs and the not-so-cryptic warnings she receives from other characters. The only ones who see everything from behind closed doors areAndrew and Enzo, and how sad it is thata novel written by a woman, with a woman as a protagonist, should depict both its female main characters as such hapless damsels in distress?Nina has no agency at all, she\'s only good to be rescued by her super-hot, muscled, Italian stud, and even Millie shows no initiative at all up until the very ending.On the good side, the narrative flows easily enough, making the read a quick one. On the not so good side, there are some huge plotholes that make the whole novel feel like a joke: for starters,Enzo\'s charade doesn\'t hold water. It\'s simply not believable that a man in his thirties who has lived and worked in the US for 3 years, being employed by a dozen families in such a posh neighbourhood, and who is considered the best at what he does, would not speak any English at all, not even the most basic communication that Italian children are taught in primary school. When we find out that he\'s just pretending, it\'s even worse! How would he ever get a job with all those very wealthy, very elitist families if he wasn\'t able to let on that he spoke the language? How would he be able to follow his customer\'s instructions, to the point that he\'s considered ""the best at his job"", if he had to pretend he didn\'t understand them at all?And what about the ""translating apps"" that Millie mentions in the very beginning of the book, hoping that they\'ll help her communicate with Enzo, except then she never uses them, never mentions them again and spends the rest of the novel complaining that she has no way of communicating with Enzo?What about the security guard who searches Millie on the basis of a random phonecall tipping him off about her alleged shoplifting? In the real world, no security guard in their right mind would do such a thing: they would more likely enquire who the person calling them is, and how can they know who is a shoplifter and describe how the shoplifter is dressed, since they\'re calling *from outside the shop*.How can Millie describe her new, tiny attic room in the Winchester house as an ""inhuman place, like a torture chamber"", when she\'s been living in the back of her car right before moving to said attic room, and has spent 10 years in jail right before that?Let\'s not even mention how far-fetched the twist aboutthe policeman\'s daughteris, and how it would be absolutely impossible to simplydrop an investigation like that, even if a random policeman decided to.Still, I wouldn\'t have minded the plotholes so much if the characterisation hadn\'t been so bad: literally all of the characters, including the protagonist, are nothing more than stock characters, flat, cartoonish figurines in no way relatable or interesting. On top of that, all 4 main characters (I\'m counting the 9-year-old brat as well, yes) are completely, irredeemably despicable. The only vaguely likeable character is Enzo, but then he\'s a walking stereotype, so in the end I didn\'t like him either.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'what in the batshit crazy, psycho, disturbing verity by colleen hoover was thatgive me more'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""It was a quick fun read, exactly what I needed. The book gripped me from the start and I struggled to put it down.The story is not something unique tbh. But the way it's told is chef's kiss.

The story is told in three parts, I found part 1 and part 2 to be quite predictable but part 3 is what wowed me.It is only when I learned Nina's truth, that I found myself sympathizing with her (to a limit).

I think I have only read 6 with 4 of them being Holly Jackson's books but that's pretty much it, and I remembered how quickly I read them and how much I enjoyed some of them so I decided that I was going to read a lot of thrillers when I got free in June and The housemaid was the first target and it's safe to say, I loved it. The way this was so fast paced and it had me hooked!! I would've read it in one sitting but because of Eid and having so many guests over and with my cousins coming to stay with us, it made it hard for me to binge read this but I still read a huge portion of it whenever I picked it up, I was literally forced to keep it down. I stand by what I said, thrillers are the hardest to write because it's a mess at the start, there are so many leads and only one culprit and the way you have to tie all of them together while keeping the reader hooked is a really hard job which Freida nailed 🤭 this book also gave me verity vibes and I was here for it.The story follows our main character Millie who's an ex-convict, desperate for a job. She finds one as a housemaid for the Winchesters and from there onwards her life starts to get messy. I would say Millie in this book was a badass, especially with how everything was done in the end 😭🤌🏻 wow just wow. I really liked her. I won't talk about Nina and Andrew because they are heavily tied to the plot and plot twists and well....I mean I guessed the main twist but not the intensity of it but some of you may not so I won't say anything except for how conflicting and interesting characters they were to read and 👀 Enzo 👀 can we get more scenes of him??In thrillers the one thing I learned was that it's never the first person who the MC thinks of as the culprit so my doubts were on someone else and I had predicted that it would be them but didn't know why or how and man 💀 that was fucked up, the intensity of what they did skyrocketed it really helped me feel for our victim.I also liked how well it was partitioned into three parts and how one followed mille then Nina and then both.Overall, I think that all that I can talk about without spoiling anything but I would definitely recommend it because I had an amazing time.____This is Freida McFadden's highest rated book.......let's see what the hype is all about 🤭(Let the June thriller tbr marathon begin!)""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '★4 stars“""I can’t seem to shake that uneasy feeling. That I should get out of here while I still can.""As this is aspoiler free reviewit\'s going to be short and sweet as I can\'t say too much. I can see why this psychological thriller is so popular! It\'s definitely a fast faced page turner.The plotMillie Calloway is hired to be an in-house maid for the Winchesters’ in a time when she is desperate, living out of her car and no one will take a chance on her. The Winchesters’ are a very well off, upper-class couple who have a 9 year old daughter, Cecila. When Millie enters the house she starts to realise that not everything is as perfect as it seems. Unfortunately for Millie, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.╰⪼Thoughts""There’s something about this room that’s making a little ball of dread form in the pit of my stomach.”The first 30% of the book was pretty slow for me but once I pushed past this it really picked up. This book is filled with plot twists and when you think you have it figured out, there\'s further reveals. It kept me on edge and while I did suspect some things earlier on, there was definitely a lot of build up towards the end that I didn\'t see coming 👀 The few twists I did guess didn\'t take away from my enjoyment of the book. This was my first Freida McFadden book and won\'t be my last.I found the writing style to be quite simple and the chapters were relatively short which made this book binge-worthy.The Housemaidis perfect if you are new to the thriller genre or picking one up after a long time. The few issues I had in the first 30% which kept my rating from being higher was that I felt the author was trying too hard to tell me how to feel as the hints and \'thriller elements\' weren\'t subtle. I also found the last couple of chapters to be a little rushed. I wanted to have chills but I sadly didn\'t feel that way but I was definitely hooked on this book.Overall, I thought the epilogue was fantastic and I can\'t wait to see what happens in books 2 and 3. This book is very entertaining and will whisk you away into the thick of it. There are some slight romance elements as well which might entice you to pick this up if you are new to thrillers.

She\'s always been at the wrong place and at the wrong time pretty much all of her life. Millie\'s been living in her cramped little car for some time now.

The pace and the short chapters keep this one afloat. The storyline has a familiar ring to it as those of us who\'ve read a billion psychological thrillers know. McFadden throws in a few zingers and twists to liven it up. Foolish people get fooled. Street-wise never do. But you press on just to experience the final outcome. And when it comes.....it comes. Not a blockbuster read by any means, but it\'s already been popular because of that eye-poking cover.

The person she hires will need to be desperate for a job, and have CERTAIN personality traits.Millie fits the criteria.She is willing to live in the tiny ATTIC room, with only one window, which seems to be painted shut, and has a lock on the OUTSIDE of the door-and she is tolerant of Cecelia who is dressed up like Wednesday from the Adams family, but definitely doesn’t have the manners of a pretty little girl.She must also need the job enough to also tolerate the split personality of Nina, herself!I enjoyed Millie’s sense of humor, and was curious to see where this would go-initially.Then came Part Two, and there is a SURPRISING twist, but it’s very OTT and the story goes off the rails at this point. 🚂And, in PART THREE, the story twists yet again.Sure, I realize this story is meant to be taken with a grain of salt, preferably served on buttered popcorn, 🍿 but, the last two parts were too crazy for my taste!But, there are MANY 5 star reviews so, IF the crazier the better is what you are looking for-it should satisfy YOU! 😉'}, {'rating': None, 'content': 'Pre-readThis is gonna be my first thriller so please be good🤞🏼'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Outlier alert!!Millie = the ex con has just being hired as a maid.

Dragged to a treacherous magical land she knows about only from legends, Feyre discovers that her captor is not truly a beast, but one of the lethal, immortal faeries who once ruled her world.At least, he’s not a beast all the time.As she adapts to her new home, her feelings for the faerie, Tamlin, transform from icy hostility into a fiery passion that burns through every lie she’s been told about the beautiful, dangerous world of the Fae. But something is not right in the faerie lands. An ancient, wicked shadow is growing, and Feyre must find a way to stop it, or doom Tamlin—and his world—forever.From bestselling author Sarah J. Maas comes a seductive, breathtaking book that blends romance, adventure, and faerie lore into an unforgettable read.","[{'rating': 1, 'content': '(Note from 4/17/2023 So someone reported this for unmarked spoilers even tho I prefaced it lol so the spoilers will be marked where they are, even though they really aren\'t spoilers at all because they do not significantly affect the plot in any way but oh well. It\'s either do this or have the entire review hidden bc of spoilers)(Note from 2/21/2023 because I apparently have to spell it out: For those of you who don\'t read comments or check dates read, I read and reviewed this book in 2018. It has been about 5 years; as I have stated in a number of comments, I will not continue this series. In the intervening years since reading this, my feelings on the matter have not changed nor have I desired to continue. Please refrain from commenting about how I need to continue the series or that I did not understand the book. I receive too many of those comments and I\'m tired of replying the same thing over and over again. This review is for me first and foremost, not you. Please move on if you do not like my take.)Me to Sarah J Maas:""Do you lie awake at night to come up with all your witty replies for the following day?""Oh dear, this is awful.The WritingThe title of this book is stupid. It\'s stupid and flashy and unrelated to the actual content of the book. It\'s solely for the ~wow~ factor. The quotable line, ""I love you... Thorns and all"" is wholely ineffective because ""thorns"" had not been established as a motif and was only used in that context in that very scene, more than halfway through the book. The word ""thorn"" was only used a grand total of 9 times in this book. The original Beauty and the Beast story had established rose motifs—you can\'t borrow good writing, even for a retelling. That\'s just lazy.The writing itself was inconsistent and poorly done.I pushed and pulled, but the mud was too slick, and held fast.Are you aware of the definition of ""slick"", Sarah J Maas? I do not think it means what you think it means.Besides that, Amarantha\'s hair drastically changed color after about 90 pages:Her red-gold hairHer black hairWhich is it, Maas? It can\'t be both unless she has unmentioned magical hair dyeing abilities.The atmosphere and the opening chapter were excellent and I was intrigued by the idea that was offered me, but the actual book did not deliver at all.This next point is a spoiler, but because I am disgusted with Sarah J Maas for including this, I amnotgoing to mark it as such, since everyone should know what kind of morals this book is supporting before they read it especially when they are as filthy and vulgar as this was.The attemptedrapeof Feyre by Tamlin was brushed off as no more than a mere romantic, steamy encounter to further their lukewarm love story. The only conclusions I can logically draw from this are all rather victim blamey, tbh—she was warned several times to stay inside with the doors locked until dawn, but she leaves her room not once but twice before dawn because she ~wants to go to the party~ and then later, after she almost gets gang-raped and is saved and then creeped out by Rhysand the sociopath, she thinks she is totally safe to go eat a bunch of cookies because, well the drums stopped, so it\'s probably okay now, and then she getssexually assaultedby Tamlin, who wasstill high with lust magic.I was about to pass out when he grabbed me, so fast I didn\'t see anything until he had me pinned against the wall.""Let go,"" I said as evenly as I could.I [pushed] him away. He grabbed my hands again and bit my neck. I cried out as his teeth clamped onto the tender spot where my neck met my shoulder. I couldn\'t move—I couldn\'t think.Before, during and after theattack, she\'s thinking,Wow, he\'s really hot. I\'m kinda uncomfortable with this, but I guess it\'s okay that he\'s drunk on lust magic, because I wanted to sleep with him anyway. That is avery wrong and dangerous way of thinking.No matter what, it isneverokay foranyoneto make someone else sexually uncomfortable or afraid, especially when they\'ve given verbal disapproval. This entire scene left a bad taste in my mouth.And then there\'s Rhysand\'s behavior. He repeatedly violates her personal space and comfort, drugging her and forcing her to""dance""for him in front of a large crowd for weeks on end after stripping her all but naked. Like all Fae males, apparently, he uses brute force to get her to comply with his sexual wishes.""But he didn\'t actually touch her; he kept his hands just on her waist!"" you say. Yeah, but did she say he could touch her at all? Did she actively encourage him to touch her? No, she did not.I pulled away, but his hands were like shackles.I would not have such an issue with this if Sarah J Maas didn\'t give the impression that she supports such behavior. That is what I find unconscionable.Besides that, the plot made no sense, even after exposition-Alis gave us the lowdown—in fact, it almost madelesssense then. It was cheesy and cliché and frankly, boring. The ""riddle"" was extremely easy and only proved that Feyre is an absolute idiot with no logical abilities, as I was able to figure it out before Amarantha had even finished saying it, and I\'m notoriously bad at riddles.The sex scenes were almost Empire of Storms levels of bad, cringey, and gross. I think Sarah J Maas doesn\'t know what YA means and isn\'t aware she\'s actually writing for NA.The WorldbuildingThe Fae were, for one thing, almost exactly the same (primarily in appearance and personality) to the ones in the Throne of Glass series, and tbh I was disappointed. They\'re not even cleverly unique faeries. They\'re just Tolkien-esque elves that are actually vampires: fangs and biting, immortality, aetherial beauty, animalistic tendencies, superiority complex. They don\'t have any distinct differences from humans in their thought processes or emotional capacities—only the same degree of variety that exists in humans.The religious system and creation story was very interesting and I really liked that aspect.The CharactersFaerie aka Belle: Sarah J Maas decided to try something new and have a first-person fixed perspective, but it didn\'t really work, because Feyre was a bland complacent character without much substance passed the surface level, and most of the interesting action took place where she couldn\'t see it. She suffered, like Celaena did in Crown of Midnight, from what I call Nehemia syndrome: the character that the MC has grown to trust, despite obvious suspicious behavior, turns out to be manipulative, and yet the MC completely overlooks that fact in favor of idolization of their lying friend. In this case, everyone in Prythian is keeping secrets from her and after almost getting her questions answered by the Suriel, Feyre decides to ""Stay with the High Lord. He will keep you safe,"" and just completely forgets that she wants answers about the blight. Also, whereas Belle left the Beast in the original story because her father was in mortal danger, in this book, Feyre leaves becauseTamlin impies that she\'s gonna get ganked by Rhys or Amarantha, the evil Faerie Queen.She is not an active protagonist. Also, her painting skills aren\'t a part of her characterization; it just feels tacked on to make her ~cool~ and ~unique~Tampon aka the Beast: I don\'t even care about this guy tbh. He\'s a confusing character who just feels like a Chaol-Rowan merge on steroids. He\'s violent, obsessive, and abusive, but also sweet, understanding, and caring, because that\'s not a contradiction. There\'s a difference between a complex character and a poorly written character.Lucien aka Lumiere/Cogsworth (his steampunk eye suggests Cogsworth but his personality suggests Lumiere): So apparently he ""hates"" Feyre even though I almost shipped them more since they consistently had better chemistry than her and Tammy, and that\'s saying a lot, because they didn\'t have chemistry.exposition-Alis aka Mrs Potts: She was okay. Just okay. She was fine.Reese\'s Cups aka also the Beast and kinda Gaston too: Is he supposed to be her love interest for the rest of the series or something, because the fan art definitely suggests that, but, uh, did everyone forget that he\'s a dangeroussociopathwith a history of violence?? He has no regard for her emotional well-being and sees her body as literally nothing beyond a sexual plaything. He\'s a horrible person.Amarantha: Why did there have to be a ""big bad evil Faerie Queen"" in this at all? There\'s already one in the Throne of Glass series and I can only take so much female-against-female hate from a supposedly feminist fantasy writer. Amarantha was bland and predictable, and her motivations were extremely surface-level.Her fam: Nesta was like, supposed to have some kind of implied character arc but lol it wasn\'t very good. Elain was nice and I liked her. The dad was okay, I guess. Pretty forgettable tbhIsaac Hale aka fake-out Gaston: This character wasn\'t important at all, but I just wanted to say that I think this is the dumbest name choice in a high fantasy book that I\'ve ever seen.Isaac Hale?? Really, Sarah J Maas? Really? That\'s the Jason of fantasy names. This is a the-guy-who-went-to-high-school-with-my-older-sister kind of name. It\'s not a fantasy name.ConclusionWhile I managed to read it fairly quickly, I had to dnf it for several days before deciding to trudge through. It was horrendous. I may pick up the sequel at some point, idk, but for now, from what I predict and understand from various spoilers I\'ve encountered on the internet, I don\'t really care about this series very much. Frankly, it\'s not good.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""That was both horrible and incredible at the same time, and my thoughts are a whirlwind.Note: The first part of this review is spoiler-free, but the second half is most definitely not. The spoilery section is blocked off by siren emojis (🚨). Skip to the end for bonus content, including an ACOTAR rap written by yours truly.This is the story of a mortal girl, Feyre, who kills a Fae in the woods one day. She’s whisked away to Prythian, home of the Fae, where she will live the rest of her days as punishment for murdering the wolf.Whoever said this was a Beauty and the Beast retelling is clearly not okay. This is far from a retelling, becauseit takes all the important themes outand leaves just the bare plotline:1. The Beast (Tamlin) is not ugly or even a beast at all. He just has a mask stuck to his face forever as part of a curse that I will get into more in the spoilery section.2. We are not aware of any good reason for Tamlin to keep Feyre until the very end, and it’s still a flimsy reason (this relates back to the curse).The problem with the plot is that the foreshadowing is so faint. The plot in the beginning and up until the 75 percent mark makes no sense at all. Tamlin takes Feyre to live in luxury, with good food and nice clothes and freedom, because she killed his fellow Fae? It’s just nonsensical.How is that a punishment at all?She no longer has to care for her spoiled sisters, she’s away from the poor village.However, it does make sense in the end, but Feyre is very naive for believing all of this. Something doesn’t add up. People who DNF this book will be very confused indeed.In Beauty and the Beast, we know of the curse beforehand, so we can find a good reason for the Beast to be kind to Belle. But Tamlin? It’s a mystery.So anyway, Feyre gets taken to a land of luxury to live out the rest of her days in comfort as “punishment,” but she’s still not happy because for some reason she misses her sisters, even though they treated her like dirt.She falls in love with Tamlin, which was expected because he’s not a Beast. There’s no barrier to overcome here.She isn’t forced to look past his ugly exterior because he has no ugly exterior.Along the way, another Fae named Lucien conveniently reveals everything Feyre needs to know right before it happens. This is supposed to be foreshadowing? I think? But in the end, he makes things so easy for Feyre and there’s no conflict whatsoever.The only problems arise from Feyre’s own stupidity.Their exchanges basically go like this:Lucien: The Suriel are super dangerous and even hard for the Fae to trap so stay away.Feyre: *makes simple snare* *kills chicken* oOpS I caught one, what a coincidence!!Everything is far too easy for Feyre.She’s supposed to be a responsible hunter, but instead she makes stupid, reckless decisions that don’t line up with her character. She follows an illusion of her father despite being told it’s fake, she goes outside on Fire Night, she chases the Suriel, she goes after Tamlin… etc.If you tell her not to do something, she will do it.Lucien: Stay in your room, it’s dangerous.Tamlin: Stay in your room, it’s dangerous.Literally everyone ever: Stay in your room, it’s dangerous.Feyre: *gets a midnight snack*Feyre is trying to figure out the details of this blight that’s supposed to be taking over Prythian, but luckily for her, Lucien and Tamlin give everything away with no struggle whatsoever.The result is thatthe danger does not feel genuine.It feels like a cheesy way to add angst to the relationship between Feyre and Tamlin.Speaking of Tamlin, everyone hates him so much but he’s such a sweetheart. I know that he gets worse in ACOMAF, but there’s nothing wrong with him in this book. He may be a little bland, but he’s much better than Rhysand. More details in the spoilery section.And then we have the writing, which is just bad. “...” is used in every other sentence, the poor em dashes are abused, and Feyre’s bones bark. A lot. Like, every time she falls down, she describes her barking bones. And what’s up with the phrase “my bowels turned watery?” It’s used at least twice and I don’t like it at all. This is notShatter Me.🚨🚨🚨SPOILER ALERT🚨🚨🚨So, what’s up with Amarantha?I really do like her. She’s a compelling villain because she’s (somewhat) realistic. Sure, she tortures people for fun, but her backstory makes this seem (somewhat) reasonable. (Somewhat.)Basically, she kidnaps Tamlin and Feyre runs after them because she has no self-preservation instinct. She challenges Amarantha, and in return, she is given three trials. If she wins them all, she and Tamlin will be free and his powers will return. If she loses… well, Amarantha keeps saying that there wouldn’t be enough left of Feyre to burn.However, Amarantha gives her a different option. She could solve a riddle.This is when things go downhill. First of all, why would Amarantha bet all her power and might on a simple riddle? It’s not even that hard to solve. The riddle itself is bad. The rhyming pattern isn’t great. And worst of all, the answer?It’s love.The answer is love.How does this make sense? Amarantha is a brutal, sadistic villain, so why would she write such a cliche, cheesy riddle?She should have made it oddly specific so Feyre would never get it.Anyway, Feyre answers it correctly at the last minute, Amarantha loses all her power, and Tamlin kills her.It was far too easy.Moving onto Rhysand. I hate him with a burning passion. He’s a greasy, crusty, dusty, musty old man. I can’t believe Feysand is the endgame ship. I’m suing. This is ridiculous. I don’t understand how people love him. He’s abusive, uncomfy, and weird.People keep telling me that I will love Rhysand in ACOMAF and hate Tamlin. First of all, I highly doubt it.Second of all,if you have to rely on making one character a villain just to get people to like the other character, that’s bad writing.Finally, the curse is so specific and random. Tamlin has to fall in love with a mortal girl who hates the Fae so much that she killed one in cold blood, and he has to wear a mask, and she can't know it's a curse.🚨🚨🚨END OF SPOILERS🚨🚨🚨In conclusion: Feyre is an idiot, Tamlin is precious, and Rhysand deserves to rot in a hole.Also, I wrote a rap. It’s called *prim coughing fit*Feyre Darling.Slight spoilers for ACOMAF.Feyre DarlingBy SofiaI let out a breath I didn't realize I was holdingRhys's hair is black but Tam's is goldenWill my bones bark or will they meowCome along Suriel and sing with me nowMy name is FeyreFeyreAnd I'm a standard YA MCWhat stupid things will I do?

DNF at 30% because I just got fed up with things moving at a snail\'s pace and NOT MAKING SENSE AT ALL. This was one of the most uncompelling versions ofBeauty and the Beastthat I have ever read. The writing is nothing outstanding, there was nothing that moved me. I feltCruel Beautyamong other B&B retellings I\'ve read this year and last have done a far superior job at moving me emotionally.Look, I\'m sure by the end of the book, all the things tie together and everything\'s just dandy and things will make sense, and I\'d be like ""ooooooh, so that\'s why ____."" Me, I don\'t care. Ain\'t nobody got time for that. I have so many questions and I\'m just fed up. This is not a retelling of Beauty and the Beast. This is a book about a girl who gets to live an easy life with a guy who\'s implied to be a gorgeous Fae underneath his mask.The original story makes sense: here\'s roughly how it goes. Handsome prince is cursed to be ugly unless he gets a chick to fall for him. Flash forward, there\'s Belle\'s dad. Belle\'s dad wanders into Beast\'s castle and touches his stuff. Beast doesn\'t like the fact that Belle\'s dad touched his stuff. Beast is going to kill Belle\'s dad unless he gets Beast some pussy. Belle\'s valiantly steps in to save dad, Beast is as nice to her as much as a hairy ugly, self-conscious, socially ostracized monster can be. Belle is treated like a princess because Beast really, really fucking needs her to save him and his people before the curse runs out!There\'s a reason Belle is treated like the queen! Things make sense! They have to learn to trust one another. Things are slowly developed an built over time. There is a hideous beast who is scarred emotionally, and a beauty who needs to look past the exterior. There is a point. Not so with this book.Things are far, far too easy with this book.Now here\'s this version of Beauty and the Beast,a retelling that tries to be bad-ass and fails completely,from the little that I have read.There\'sFeyrewho has a pretty crappy life with an absentminded, worthless, spineless dad, and two of the most bitchy, ungrateful sisters in the entire world. She slaves for them, she hunts food for them, she works her ass off for them. Without her, their family would starve. They don\'t care. I feel some pity for her, but she acts like so much of a martyr that there\'s only so much I can take.While hunting one day, Feyre kills a wolf, well, surprise, surprise, that wolf turns out to be a Fae in disguise. In return for this kill, Feyre is taken by a wolf (who\'s a Fae in disguise) away from her family.“What is the payment the Treaty requires?”His eyes didn’t leave my face as he said, “A life for a life. Any unprovoked attacks on faerie-kind by humans are to be paid only by a human life in exchange.”A life for a life!Oh, no! Is she going to die?! That\'s what a life for a life means, right?WRONG. Feyre is taken off to magical Fairyland to live in luxury for the rest of her life while her family is taken care of back in their little village.“Some would say it’s unwise to insult a Fae in his home,” Tamlin ground out. “Some would say you should be grateful for me finding you before another one of my kind came to claim the debt, for sparing your life and then offering you the chance to live in comfort.”So what?!Why?!This makes no sense at all.Feyre kills one of their kind. A beloved brother.In exchange, there isabsolutely no punishment whatsoever. She gets to live in a fantastically fabulous castle, waited on by servants. She gets beautiful clothes and delicious food.Another useless answer. I dug into my breakfast, savoring each rich sip of tea, and she slipped into the bathing chamber. When I was done eating and bathing, I refused Alis’s offer and dressed myself in another exquisite tunic—this one of purple so deep it could have been black.Clearly there is some kind of a setup involving The Treaty, since there seems to be a lot of secrecy between the Fae...but wait, whatever information she wants, the Fae reveals...they\'re revealing their own weakness to Feyre, who is constantly plotting her own escape.It doesn\'t make any sense!“There is … a sickness in these lands. Across Prythian. There has been for almost fifty years now. It is why this house and these lands are so empty: most have left. The blight spreads slowly, but it has made magic act … strangely. My own powers are diminished due to it. These masks”—he tapped on his—“are the result of a surge of it that occurred during a masquerade forty-nine years ago. Even now, we can’t remove them.”Over and over and over,the Fae reveal their secrets to her, including one that might help her escape.“So there are faeries who will actually answer any question if you trap them?” Maybe they’d know how to free me from the Treaty’s terms.“Yes,” he said tightly. “The Suriel. But they’re old and wicked, and not worth the danger of going out to find them.And then pretty much the next chapter, she goes out AND IMMEDIATELY FINDS THESE MYSTERIOUS CREATURES. WHAT THE FUCK.I do not like it when things come so easily to a main character, and everything comes easily to Feyre. There is no consequence whatsoever to her actions. There is no punishment to her deed of killing. The Fae are supposed to hate her...it doesn\'t feel like it, because she is ""inconsequential."" In fact, they\'re more of her playmates than her wardens. The Fae seem to have no other things to do besides play with her and hunt with her.“My morning work was postponed,” he said. Indeed, his usual tunic was off, the baldric gone, and the sleeves of his white shirt had been rolled up to the elbows to reveal tanned forearms corded with muscle. “If you want a ride across the grounds—if you’re interested in your new … residence, I can take you.”And teach her how to read and write...because Feyre cannot read or write, an ironic twist to the Disney Belle\'s love for reading.“I could help you write to them, if that’s why you’re in here.”Feyre is irreverent, ungrateful and insulting to her wardens...in a way that gets her no punishment whatsoever.“Do you ever stop being such a prick?” I snapped back.Dead—really, truly, I should have been dead for that.But Lucien grinned at me. “Much better.”As I said, I\'m sure this book improves in the end, but from what I\'ve read, this book makes no sense, the writing is emotionless, the characters are flat, the main character unrealistic, and I do not care to continue.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""INITIAL REACTION: WILL UPDATE WITH REVIEW LATER BUT KNOW I LOVED THIS.

I started reading it as soon as it became available and the array of positive reviews from my friends and strangers alike made me feel sure I would love it. But I didn\'t. It is possible I expected all the wrong things fromA Court of Thorns and Roses, and maybe my review can prevent others from doing the same.Here\'s what I expected:an intricate fantasy world, supernatural politics and alliances, fast-paced action, a sensual romance - perhaps similar toCruel Beautyand otherBeauty and the Beastretellings, and a flawed but likable heroine.But this book is, if you ask me, nothing more or less thansoftcore erotica. Which is fine, if that\'s what you\'re looking for.I personally thought that the fantasy aspect felt like trimmings around a story that was all about a romance between Feyre (the narrator) and Tamlin (a High Lord of the Fae). There are some titillating scenes where Tamlin bites Feyre\'s neck and they have sex - undoubtedly the best bits of the book and I won\'t pretend I didn\'t feel a little hot under the collar myself. But the ""ancient wicked shadow"" promised in the blurb is only really a source of more romantic angst for Feyre and Tamlin.However, I *do* like a good romance as much as anyone, so there are other reasons this book didn\'t quite work for me. In order to express what I mean, I\'m going to compareA Court of Thorns and RosestoCruel Beauty, which is, in my opinion, a better book.In CB, I felt the chemistry between Nyx and Ignifex as soon as their loaded banter started to fill the pages. They were sexy together, Ignifex was an evil ruler (which was a real problem for their relationship) with blood-red eyes, and the supernatural part of the book was creepy, weird and completely unique. Despite enjoying the actual non-PG scenes inA Court of Thorns and Roses, I never felt any real chemistry between Feyre and Tamlin or any realistic challenge to their relationship.What makesBeauty and the Beastsuch a compelling romance?One that demands to be told over and over again in so many different ways? I\'ll tell you what it is: it\'s the obstacles, the challenges, the improbability...how can a young woman come to love an ugly beast?We ask.I\'ll prove it\'s possible!The author replies. That\'s why readers fall in love with the beast again and again, even when he is furry and has horns like the Disney version. I loved the Disney beast.And that badass fox in Robin Hood so it\'s possible I have issues.Tamlin is not a beast.“Even as he bit out the words, I couldn’t ignore the sheer male beauty of that strong jaw, the richness of his golden-tan skin.”Oh my, how could a poor young woman ever love a pretty-faced, golden-haired, completely not evil Fae prince? How weird.Maas is a good writer and the beginning - before Feyre is taken to the Fae world - made me believe a great book was on the way. When Maas writes action, she writes actionreallywell. But there was far too little of it in this book. It came in behind the descriptions of beautiful Fae men and the Fae palace.In short:It just wasn\'t nasty enough.In truth, this felt more like an extended Cinderella retelling than what it was supposed to be. A girl lives in poverty and looks after her rather annoying sisters until one day she is swept up by a prince who takes her to his beautiful palace (after about three chapters). I just find it hard to recommend this when I thinkCruel Beautyis similar and yet so much better.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Tumblr'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""4.45/5 ⭐Full review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolf🐺This book’s mood song match –Fix You by Coldplaymum: *enters kitchen at 3 am* What the hell are you doing?me: *with a bowl of ice cream in one hand and ACOTAR in the other* I'm starting another SJM seriesmum: Hang on, I have a bottle of vodka here somewhere*And if this is not some relatable shit when facing Sarah J. Maas’s books then I don’t know what to tell you anymore. You puzzle me.So, there you go – another great universe erected by SJM just in front of our humble eyes. She is building her own fucking multiverse and we are here to witness the power of a goddess at work. I will make three sacrifices for that.This is, so far, for me, the best Beauty and the Beast reimagination.HER EXECUTION STYLE IS THE AIR TO MY LUNGS.And this one is not even the best of her works.“Magic – everything was magic, and it broke my heart.”Mainly, our action is happening at the Spring Court where our main character finds herself in front of a new intriguing life. Or at least as intriguing as a Court of flowery gardens can be.As I always say about SJM’s books,the characters are the ones who make the action. It’s like they are the very engine of a plot.I kind of likeFeyre. She definitely has her own personal issues, mainly because she is broken and lonely and desperate to beat her status. She is human and miserable, mainly because her family is horrible. Her whole family was created to look like the typical fairytale family – an absent coward of a father, an uninterested mother, a sister full of wicked hatred and another one caught up in her own world, sensitive and naïve. Until her sisters do something worthy of my affection, I ain’t changing my mind about them.Lucien(the Emissary of the Spring Court), I must say, I liked from the very beginning, but he somehow managed to grow on me. There was something likeable about him at first and he only proved that to me more as the action went on.Tamlin, the High Lord of the Spring Court, on the other hand, seemed a bit stiff the whole book, even though I sometimes appreciated the occasional softness of his heart.But full-on honesty now – thebestthing about this book, the one thing that made it 110% better wasRhysand. He won for this book a full star from me with all of his domineering prick moves. He played the bad boy role so good that my traitorous heart enjoyed him whole. I might have a problem but oh, what a perfect problem he is.“His voice was a lover’s purr that sent shivers through me, caressing every muscle and bone and nerve.”Sexy.Rhysand and Feyre certainly have a sort of total chemistry that it seems Feyre doesn’t have with Tamlin; not even after theysupposedlyfell in love with each other. I don’t buy that love for more than a second and by the end when everything seemed to try to make me believe their relationship I was still not convinced.I recognise fabulous chemistry when I see one and that ain’t it. Rhysand, you’d better act up, love, I have expectations. You’re more than just a cruel, beautiful ruffian, I know it.There’s a certain cruelty in this book, so very Maas. I sometimes feel like I’m reading the words of a psychopath, but then I remind myself how much Ienjoythis cruelty in these books and I temperate myself.That crazy wretch Amarantha is definitely the embodiment of cold murder and torture in this book and this is visible when it comes to how much her actions affect the other characters’ moods and movements. It’s terribly interesting though to see how terrified all of them can become when facing her.But by the end, there was this sliver of hope that lingered. And that broke the evil to pieces.“This wasn’t music to dance to – it was music to worship, music to feel in the gaps of my soul, to bring me to a place where there was no pain.”Even though I think this is not the best of SJM’s works, I still believe is so very good that just makes you want to know more. It leaves you craving. And in my humble opinion, that’s a bonus factor in books.All and all, my first step into the ACOTAR universe has been a success. More steps to come. Until I fall in love. Wholly and irrevocably.""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I cannot remember ever being this conflicted over a book. There are parts of A Court of Thorns and Roses I really loved, but a lot of parts I really hated.I went into this book fully expecting to love it. Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite fairy tales, and I was interested to see how SJM made the story her own.First off, my biggest problem with this story was Feyre as a character. I have never been so irritated. Her character development and personality, for the most part, didn\'t make sense to me. She was the caretaker of her entire family for years, supposedly a hunter with a strong survival instinct. And yet, she proceeded to make the stupidest decisions and put herself in danger time and time again. I didn\'t get the sense that she did this out of bravery, but more out of stupidity. It didn\'t mesh with what her character was supposed to be. Examples of these idiotic choices:1. Repeatedly plotting to escape into a faerie land that she knew to be deadly, when she was asleep on the way to the manor and obviously wouldn\'t know her way back to the mortal lands2. Running after the illusion of her CRIPPLED father at NIGHT, when she has been told and witnessed how deceptive fae can be3. Trapping a Suriel with little more than a snare, in the deadly part of the forest, after she has been told, and AGAIN, SEEN how dangerous these creatures are4. Going to Fire Night after being told how dangerous it is, not leaving after being almost raped by 3 faeries, and then proceeding to leave her room AGAIN afterwards5. Drinking the faerie wine at the Solstice, even after Lucien of all people warned her not to6. Leaving the manor when the Suriel flat out TOLD her not to and that she would be safe with Tamlin, and deciding to not mention that to ANYONE before he forced her to leaveIn addition to all of these idiotic choices, she also is incredibly inconsistent. She\'ll go from hating Fae to sympathizing with them to loving them back to fearing them at the drop of a hat. These inconsistencies are probably the most irritating, as there are scenes that I absolutely adore with Feyre, but then she goes back to doing the next pain in the ass thing on the next page.I also found her relationship with Tamlin to be problematic. Yes, I do enjoy problematic things (especially ships from time to time) but there were a lot of things I couldn\'t excuse with them. Again, more inconsistencies in characters\' behavior. Tamlin\'s hot and cold behavior was eventually explained, but not until 70% of the way through the book. It was too little too late. Also,I found the Fire Night scene to be a problem for me. I do enjoy volatile relationships and bad boy characters. But only when we are told from the beginning that one of the characters is ""bad"". Tamlin we are led to believe is a saint, then he bites her and gets possessive, but all is forgiven the next morning. Because he\'s a ""nice guy."" No.The world building I found to be lackluster in a lot of ways. While I really enjoyed the wide variety of Fae creatures we got to see, I thought that a lot of the back story was revealed in a lazy way. Instead of having Feyre figure anything out for herself, important things are told to her through long monologues from a number of characters throughout the book. This happens numerous times.Additionally, few side characters have any development and most felt like blank slates. With that being said, the ones that were developed I adored. Lucien and Rhys saved the book for me in a lot of ways. I found them both to be complex and interesting characters.The last 10-15% of the book saved it for me. I found the plot to finally be interesting, and I found Feyre\'s decisions in those chapters to actually make sense. A lot of things were set up for future books that have me very intrigued, and I\'m looking forward to the rest of the series. Many things that I disliked in this book, may in fact be remedied due to some of the occurrences in this last small section of the book.Overall, I was disappointed by this first installment. While there were elements I really enjoyed, they didn\'t make up for the elements I didn\'t. I\'m hoping future installments will prove to be better.I will also be doing a full video review and spoiler-filled discussion on mychannelin the future if you want to know more of my thoughts.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""If you've ever wondered which literary world would be the best to live in, wonder no longer, cause there's aBookTube Videoto answer that!The Written Review:----------Update - 12/6/19ShouldI cross the insurmountable TBR? Or reread this series again?I think you know the answer----------Here's the original review:Feyre is huntingin the middle of the woods tokeep her useless starving family alive(Hunger Games, anyone?).A chance encounter with a wolf - who wasn't entirely a wolf - leaves Feyreon the wrong end of an ancient treaty.She is forced to go to the fairy realm to live out the remaining years of her human life -no friends, no family and no freedom.“Has anyone ever taken care of you?” he asked quietly.“No.” I’d long since stopped feeling sorry for myself about it.At first, she cannot think of anything but escape. Slowly (but surely), she is swept into the fairy realm -in its magic & intrigue, in its danger & hopelessness, and in its wonder & glory.“Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, Dawn, Day, and Night,” it mused, as if I hadn’t even answered. “The seven Courts of Prythian, each ruled by a High Lord, all of them deadly in their own way. They are not merely powerful—they are Power.”Feyre lands in the Spring court - which is under amasquerade cursefor nearly fifty years.The court is being attacked by all manner of terrible creatures and there is ablight upon the land.This blight will soon cross to the human realm - threatening everyone Feyre holds dear.The first half sucksbut keep readingThere's no way around it. From page 1 to about 200, Feyre isannoying and obstinate.I nearly put this book down half a dozen times (it was like readingRed Queen).BUT, there was something about it that kept me interested.AND THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT.Because wow. Seriously wow.Midway through the book,things turned around magnificently.It was like a whole new book.Sarah J Maas is a devious little thing.Suddenly, all the plot holes, nonsensical actions of her fairy captors (Tamlin and Lucien) and Feyre's complete idiocy flipped on their heads.Everything makes sense now.I literally could not put this down.Though, and maybe it's just me, butthe Tamlin-Feyre arc felt a bit rushed/forced.Her constant love declarations really had me questioning their relationship. But then again, I had a friend who accidentally spilled the beans on that one.Without giving any spoilers, I sure hope book 2 does acomplete character shifton you-know-who (NOT voldemort) because I amnot pleasedwith the way the love interest was hinted at during the end of the book. (He's such a jerk!)Overall, I amamazedby how much effort Sarah J. Maas put into constructing this story. I'm this close || to rereading the book solely to better appreciate all those little clues that I must have passed over.So, if you pick this up and just aren't feeling it -keep reading- trust me.The Finer Books Club - 2018 Reading Challenge: A book recommended by a friendYouTube|Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Facebook| Snapchat @miranda_reads""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""4.8/5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️“Don't feel bad for one moment about doing what brings you joy.”I'm speechless. What am I supposed to say after this? Am I supposed to write a coherent review with vital points as to why this book WAS FUCKING AMAZING??? I CAN'T EVEN TALK RIGHT NOW I'M SPEECHLESS. I WANT THE SECOND BOOK IN MY HANDS BUT MY ORDER STILL HASN'T COME. I'M READY TO GO TO FUCKING ENGLAND MYSELF AND PURCHASE IT. KIDS I'M LITERALLY DYING HERE.The Beauty and the Beast-esque fantasy drama tells the story of Feyre, who finds herself entwined with faeries after unknowingly killing one. When the 19-year-old huntress kills a wolf in the woods, a beast-like creature arrives to demand retribution for it. Dragged to a treacherous magical land she only knows about from legends, Feyre discovers that her captor is not an animal, but Tamlin, one of the lethal, immortal faeries who once ruled their world. Feyre must find a way to stop it or doom Tamlin and his world forever.I'm not a fantasy fan. I love fantasy in film and tv but not in books. I picked up this book cause I wanted to use it for my thesis for uni (don't even ask) and now after I graduated I decided to give it a go. My favorite genres to read are historical fiction and contemporary, and fantasy falls on a very different category. But the fantasy in this book man... it gripped me tight and didn't let me go.First I started off this book a bit confused. The language confused me a bit, the terms, all the information. I'm reading books in English while my native language is Greek so fantasy fell a bit harsh on me. As I said, I'm not a fantasy fan, and with fantasy comes many weird words and shit like that. But I kept going and after a while I got used to everything and started to enjoy the plot and the characters. I enjoyed very much the factor that there weren't many characters in this book. I don't like when a book is crowded with characters, it doesn't give me the space to love them all. This book succeeded in making all the characters lovable for me... even Rhysand. I fucking love Rhysand man. Unexpected feelings happening.The worldSarah J. Maascreated is so rich and dark and gloomy but also happy and hopeful and full of light, I truly enjoyed reading about it. I always get bored, to be honest, with descriptions and politics of different worlds but this one excited me. Even the fucking politics were exciting. I want to delve more into this world wHEN MY FUCKING BOOK ARRIVES.Now to the juicy shit... the romance. Holy fucking shit. I ship these two so hard I can't even breathe. When he sent her away I wanted to scream! He gave her a good fucking and left her hanging. Why am I laughing at this? But honestly, the romance was amazing. At first, I felt like the entire book was only gonna be about the romance and I didn't quite enjoy that but after all the revelations and the twists in the plot, the romance was used wisely. And I didn't expect that, because I have heard lots of things about this book. And now we have Rhysand... this dark, handsome motherfucker who has a gloomy past. This will become a triangle, I can feel it in my bones. But I'm here for it, for some reason. I love the heat Maas's romances convey in me.To sum it all up, this book took me a while to get into but it was all worth it. Maybe after this book I will start reading more fantasy. Maybe. Maybe not. As I'm waiting for the sequel to arrive, I will drawn my sorrow into crying about how amazing this first book was. Or maybe reread some parts. Maybe. Anyway, till the next one K BYE!!!""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '2.5 StarsOnce again, I find myself the odd man out when it comes to a massively popular book...I went into this really excited and andreallywanting to love this thing.After seeing this book and its successors paint my feed with its courts and thorns and wings and ruin, I knew there was a lot of hype surrounding this series in general.And this first installment just didn\'t live up to it for me, sadly.There, there, Court Thornians...Quite frankly, the first 60% of this book dragged like a U-Haul trailer with no wheels.Nothing really happened and the things that did didn\'t even make sense until after the book was over.And I\'m just not a fan of that. I like to enjoy bookswhileI\'m reading them, not only for the last 25-35% when everything that was murky throughout the whole book becomes clear.I also found myself WAY more interested in Rhysand than the actual love interest, Tamlin. Whoops!THAT SAID.Ididenjoy the writing and the ending.And while those things aren\'t enough to prompt me to rate this thing any higher,I AM going to read the second book.I trust my peeps and all of you are saying that, while the first book drags, the second book is ""OMG amazeballs.""

Despite not being a fan of the superfluous writing style or the lackluster world-building, I was still willing to rate it 3 stars by viewing it as an easy guilty pleasure romance book. The relationship seems harmless and I still don't see how it's as problematic as people dramatize it to be. The first half of the book is a standard Beauty and the Beast retelling — not awful, but not special either — and then the second half really dips in quality, which lowered my rating to 2 stars.A couple glaring issues that stood out to me:1) The background story of the curse is literally told instead of shown via a side character's lengthy monologue. This was disappointing since I was intrigued to find this out by piecing clues together, not by being told it straightforwardly like a regurgitated wikipedia article.2) The main character seems relatively smart but consistently has leaps of logic that are clearly there for the sake of plot. 9 out of 10 times she won't follow the advice of another character.3) The antagonist is SO cartoonish — like mustache-twirling cartoonish. She gives a bunch of arbitrary challenges and rules for no reason other than for the sake of stringing along a story. It feels like she's hosting a game show or some overly complex scavenger hunt. There's no reason why she'd bother setting up any of these superfluous rules. I think this is the worst antagonist I've ever read.I'm willing to overlook the writing style and bland romance, but once I got to the part where Feyre answers the riddle, I had to drop it down to 2 stars because it was so ridiculous and lazy. I've heard that the sequel is much better though, so I am willing to give it another try, just not any time soon haha.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'First read: May 2015Second read: May 2016Third read: April 2017Fourth read: February 2018Fifth read: June 2019 — I think this is my most read series alongside Harry Potter and Mistborn.Sixth reread: Feb 2021Seventh reread: September 2023Every reread of this book has somewhat differed but nothing too drastic. It’s still my least favourite in the series. There’s nostalgia involved since this was my first book by Sarah J Maas. I’ve become really familiar with these books now. Or maybe I should say attached.It’s a great Beauty and the Beast retelling. It’s a great setup for the books to come, especially where Feyre is concerned and her character development, which is where Maas excels at.I quite frankly hated how loyal Feyre was to her family, though it’s understandable. But it’s this level of loyalty without any concern for her own well-being that leads to her downfall. Her loyalty to Tamlin when it came to the events that happen towards the end of the book destroy her. It was uncomfortable to read and see Feyre come to this realisation herself.This seems to straddle the line of YA and NA fantasy, which is why I’m assuming the world-building feels so lacklustre, and at times, juvenile. Amarantha read like a spoiled child, though she’s the villain. I just didn’t care for the magic and world-building in this book because of how underdeveloped they felt.Thank the stars this improves leaps and bounds in the sequels. Everything improves drastically in the sequels.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'An illiterate 19 year old straight up kills a guy and is outraged when there are consequences.

Her days of living in anonymity among the Humans are over: she has been called upon to uphold a historic peacekeeping alliance between the Vampyres and their mortal enemies, the Weres, and she sees little choice but to surrender herself in the exchange—again...Weres are ruthless and unpredictable, and their Alpha, Lowe Moreland, is no exception. He rules his pack with absolute authority, but not without justice. And, unlike the Vampyre Council, not without feeling. It’s clear from the way he tracks Misery’s every movement that he doesn’t trust her. If only he knew how right he was….Because Misery has her own reasons to agree to this marriage of convenience, reasons that have nothing to do with politics or alliances, and everything to do with the only thing she's ever cared about.

ALSO, if i wanna write an essay, you bet i will. i didn’t know there were rules to how we choose to write reviews! 🫣telling me to grow up but y’all are mad i didn't like your 2010 wattpad vampyre romance over a character named misery. y’all are miserable just like her name. commenting on reviews because you’re mad. 😂 you guys care way too much how strangers spend their own time, it's concerning.in reply to most comments i get:“get a job” i do, and it pays well. it pays more than enough for myself, for my bills, and for my food.“get a life” says the one commenting on a review they disagree with.“why spend your time reading her books” because i can. thanks for caring about how i chose to spend my own time.“did you need to write a whole essay?” did they never teach you in class how to write essays? these are bullet points. there’s a difference. but if i wanna write an ‘essay’ over a book i didn’t like, i will. maybe teach yourself what the words opinion and decision means.“it’s not that serious” so why are you mad?“you’re boring” good thing we aren’t friends.----------------------------------------if ali hazelwood has 1000 haters, i’m one of them. if ali hazelwood has 100 haters, i’m one of them. if ali hazelwood has 50 haters, i’m one of them. if ali hazelwood has 1 hater, i’m me. if ali hazelwood has no haters, it means i am dead. if the world is with ali hazelwood, then i am against the world.other actual thought because i did actually read this…this:• enemies to lovers WHERE? it is never to be seen. not even an ounce of it.• do authors not get second hand embarrassment giving their characters terrible names like misery and lowe??• vampYres instead of vampires is the cherry on top• that cover is giving 2013 wattpad era• i felt no chemistry between the characters. it’s too bad because their friendship and slow burn had potential.• of course he growls, hisses and has a very husky voice• don’t forget he’s So Big. his shoe size is 14, because that is very important and necessary information. his hand is also so big it engulfs her own. he towers over her because He’s Huge. DO NOT FORGET!• obviously he never actually Hated Her, he just had to kinda pretend. she just thinks he does because he can’t stand the smell of her. kinda like when edward was near bella that first time and she thought she reeked? yeah, like that. so she carried this misconception about what he thinks about her but OBVIOUSLY he just, has always liked her. he has been secretly obsessed with her, because when are theynot secretly obsessed but pretend they are not?never.• OF COURSE he’s broody and grumpy and can be mean in the outside but is actually a Big Softie deep down inside. DUH!• misery is quite possibly the most oblivious, useless, boring, weakest, most lame vampire i have ever read about. her being a vampire is actually really irrelevant that you might even forget she’s a vampire. she doesn’t know the difference between a ladle and spatula. ali really likes making her heroines really fucking stupid.• don’t ask me what she looks like because i wouldn’t know. all i know is that she bleeds purple and has pointy ears, which is a weird feature for vampires but whatever. it seems like this author still doesn’t like describing to her readers her characters enough to make them visualizing.• absolutely bland, boring, and very unflavored mmc, just like the rest. he’s a werewolf, has hair that is short and a rich brown cut to a buzz, is the alpha, has broad shoulders…that’s it. anything new? no, obviously. he growls and hisses, but this time he is an artist, i guess, who draws the mc, and takes care of a child.• this was only my third read from this author. i’ve readThe Love HypothesisandLove on the Brain, but i’ve avoided everything published after ‘love on the brain’ because i know i wouldn’t enjoy them. fortunately, i don’t have any desire to read them. i read this because it’s the first paranormal romance by this author, and, for some reason, i thought the genre would mean this would be different. that was not the case for me, obviously. i don’t think i’ll be reading this author again in the futureunless serena and koen get their story cause that ending?? 👀• terrible job of world-building. this author needs to stick to contemporaries. not only does this author not give enough physical descriptions about her characters features but the world building is severely lacking. there is little to no explanation of where and how everything happened. we really just get the basic information necessary. a lot of info dump in the beginning—historical context, names, wars, systems, political diplomatic views, etc. everything piled together.• formulaic, boring, cliché, and immature writing. i can’t even say it’s because this author started off writing fanfiction on ao3 when so many fanfics on ao3 (and even wattpad) are written immensely better than this. so many books published yet this this authors writing hasn’t improved since her debut. i guess when you write a book like the love hypothesis, your quality of books isn’t important anymore because you know your targeted audience will eat up the bare minimum. the characters in this might as well be the same as her previous characters except they’re in a paranormal setting.•if you are excited for this, take my review with a grain of salt as i haven’t enjoyed this author before so just because i didn’t like it, doesn’t mean you won’t.a lot of my friends love this author and her stories. if you haven’t read ali before, you might like it! or, if read her before and have an idea what to expect and don’t care about the formulaic writing, you might enjoy this! for me, the unoriginality, lack of world building, lack of physical characteristics, writing, dialogue, etc., are what made this another disappointing read. if you enjoy this though, good for you!""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '3.75/5I didn\'t expect this book to receive such a high rating from me, but as it turns out, I liked it — I liked it a lot even. I read Ali Hazelwood for the vibes and obsessed heroes, and that\'s exactly what I got, so I\'m satisfied. Satisfied to the point that this book may have become my favorite Ali book. I never thought a book with an arranged marriage between an alpha werewolf and a vampire would become one, but here we are. I guess that\'s what happens when you grow up with Wattpad.Listen. Is Ali the best author with the most gorgeous writing style? No. Does she write almost the same male characters, but with different hairstyles and workplaces? Yes. But does it matter to me? No. Her stories always absorb me from the very beginning to the end to the point where I completely forget about reality, so I simply love them despite their many imperfections. You could look me straight in the eye and tell me that these books are cringe, stupid, predictable and that I can probably find better stories on Wattpad, and I would completely agree, but I would still simply read them, as they just have that something that works for me.But, let’s move on to the point. My thoughts. Some spoilers also start here.oneIf you were expecting another short heroine and a hero who would be twice her size, you will be disappointed. We finally have a tall couple.\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200etwoI really liked our heroine Misery. Yes, Ali did her dirty with that name and some of her fashion choices — the galaxy t-shirt, but it doesn\'t change the fact that I enjoyed her character. She definitely won\'t be added to my \'favorite heroines\' folder, but compared to really dumb heroines, she wasn\'t bad.threeThe hero, despite the situation at the end when I wanted to strangle him, yes, I\'m talking about the scene in chapter twenty-five when he left her, claiming that ""it was a mistake"" and ""she shouldn\'t be tied to someone like him"", still stole my heart. I know he wanted her to finally have free will and be able to choose what she wanted in her life, but he could have approached it differently.Still, as I said, I loved him. How could I not love the possessive architect Alpha Werewolf who has an amazing way with children, who would do anything for you and his people, who would draw you, who would remind you that consent is the hottest thing in the world and with whose side you would finally find your family and your place in the world. Yes, I know the part about ""architect Alpha Werewolf"" sounds stupid and like something straight out of a bad Wattpad fanfiction, but I don\'t care.“I would take anything she chose to give me—the tiniest fraction or her entire world. I would take her for a single night knowing that I’ll lose her by morning, and I would hold on to her and never let go. I would take her healthy, or sick, or tired, or angry, or strong, and it would be my fucking privilege. I would take her problems, her gifts, her moods, her passions, her jokes, her body—I would take every last thing, if she chose to give it to me.”fourThe romance was in typical Ali Hazelwood style, meaning a hero who is almost in love with the heroine from the beginning, but for some reason doesn\'t want to admit it, and a heroine who can\'t pick up any hint about it even though it\'s quite obvious. However, this does not change the fact that I ate it up. The smut too, if you know me, you don\'t, but it was kind of hot.fiveThe plot was pretty interesting to me in the beginning, but it lost me towards the end when I stopped caring about the whole werewolf/vampire rivalry and Misery’s friend situation, but I was still intrigued enough to not put the book down once, so I won\'t complain.This was supposed to be a short review, but it didn\'t work out again, but if you are looking for a marriage in convenience romance, found family, werewolves and vamps, a slow-burn with, at least, in my opinion, great tension, don’t be shy and add it to your tbr.————————Vampires and werewolfs?

I applaud Ali Hazelwood for taking a risk out of her comfort zone and writing this paranormal romance.

But tbf I had minimal expectations 🤷\u200d♀️✔️ Vampires + werewolves✔️ Marriage of convenience✔️ Slow burnThis one came pretty close to perfection. I liked the plot, characters and romance.The paranormal romance and gothic vibes were really good, the whole environment was quite mesmerizing.Tho I would suggest that please don't go in expecting a world building- it's just romance. It's also quite fast paced and easy to binge. If you are in a reading slump, this is your cure.The characters are fun.Misery and Loweare truly made for each other. I love how they balance each other out. While Misery is unlike misery, in fact quite joyful and a fun vamp to be around. Lowe, on the other hand keeps to himself. I also noticed that Lowe although a werewolf, had a very Edward Cullen like personality. Instead of a typical douche, you are met with someone who actually cares. Misery's sarcasm and sense of humor was fun. Ali Hazelwood thankfully for once did not go over the top with it.The side characters-Ana, Serena and Alex were stand outs. Owen was kinda predictable. It also seems like there's something happening with Serena and Koen? Is there going to be another book? CAUSE I NEED IT!!!The romancewas pretty good. I devoured how Lowe and Misery were into each other. The slow burn was delicious. The spice not so much. Ali, listen to me bestie, in the most gentle way possible, babes, you cannot write smut 😭😭 I know you want to. But please for the love of God, stop writing smut. I wanna give you five stars but I can't until you stop knotting, and opening an Airbnb inside people's vaginas 😭😭On a serious note,one thing that could have been better written was the mate storyline.It did not make sense. One moment Lowe wants her, the next he doesn't, then he does, then he doesn't, and then he does. Yeah, he clearly wanted her so why write it like that?!

I'm an Ali Hazelwood stan, so my hopes for her very first PNR were extremely high, and I’m so happy that it lived up to all my expectations. This is a marriage of convenience between a vampire heroine and an alpha werewolf hero. Misery is the daughter of a powerful vampire politician and she enters a MOC with Lowe, the alpha of a werewolf pack, not just to form an alliance between the two species (who don’t like each other), but also to find out where her missing best friend is.It’s such a fun read and I loved learning about this paranormal world. The romance is classic Ali Hazelwood, just with a PNR twist. Basically, we have a hero who’s secretly pining and growing obsessed with the heroine, and she has no idea. It’s a little slow burn, but there’s still some GOOD steam. It’s focused just more in the second half of the book. But I loved Lowe and Misery, and I LOVED Misery's sense of humor.

Ali Hazelwood showed readers how to rock \'n\' roll in a fantasy universe by creating the most intelligent, quirky, nerdy heroine free of stereotypes and clichés. She possesses magical fingers that can sharpen computer skills for coding and breaking into highly secured werewolf territories!Themes of enemies to lovers and forbidden love may initially make us think we\'re in for a Twilight-like romance story. However, I assure you that this complex story offers so much more. Firstly, this book is more than a forbidden romance; it tells the tale of Misery Lark, the only daughter of the most powerful Vampyr councilman in the South, and Lowe Moreland, the most powerful Alpha of the Werewolves. Their marriage aims to bring peace and create an alliance between age-old mortal enemies. There\'s so much happening in the story, including political maneuvering and highly calculated schemes within the territories of werewolves and vampyres. A group of rebels, calling themselves the ""Loyals,"" whose lives have been spared by Lowe, seeks to avenge him by recruiting insiders from their inner circles, blackmailing them into committing treasonous acts.The story is filled with action-packed sequences, intricate world-building, and intercepted mysteries about Lowe\'s family line and Misery\'s inner circle, all of which intrigue readers to learn more. Interestingly, the adventure parts of the book slightly overshadow the romantic aspects. The fantasy world-building and the detailed rules and historical progress among werewolves, vampyres, and humans are depicted intelligently. I expected Ali Hazelwood to excel in the fantasy genre as much as in steamy romance, and I\'m thrilled to say she didn\'t disappoint.Here\'s a summary of the events in this book:After evading several attempts on her life, including bullets, knives, and other lethal weapons orchestrated to kill her, Misery leaves the Vampyre community to live in the human world with her best friend, Serena. She gets a job, wears contact lenses to conceal her irises, hides her fangs, and strives to create a peaceful life. However, her father summons her, proposing a marriage between werewolves and vampyres to establish an alliance during the reign of a new human governor. Misery is too smart not to take the bait, but as soon as she hears the name of the groom-to-be, she accepts the offer without asking for details. Is it a martyr complex, a personal concession, or does she have another agenda for her extremely masculine groom who cannot stand her scent?After the marriage ceremony proceeds without incident, if you discount the usual suicide attempts against Misery (she\'s become accustomed to these life-threatening situations since she was once a forced prisoner for a peace offering, but that\'s another story), Misery finds herself in her secluded mansion, surrounded by werewolves who despise her, searching for a reason to end the forced arrangement. Only six-year-old Anna, Lowe\'s little sister, acts friendly toward her despite her caregivers\' snarky comments about Misery.When Lowe senses the secret that threatens her unwanted marriage, he offers her an alliance to uncover the mysteries that will ultimately benefit them. However, not only their lives but also their hearts are at stake during this very perilous, full-throttle, wild adventure.Lowe is more than a vindictive alpha werewolf facade. He\'s loyal, perceptive, caring, and puts everyone\'s needs first. He\'s the first person to show how much he truly cares about her. Could she learn to trust and lower her emotional barricades to let him in?Overall, this is a smart, riveting, and highly entertaining quirky fantasy romance that I thoroughly enjoyed. I hope there will be more to come, as implied in the epilogue. I wholeheartedly congratulate my favorite steamy romance author for immersing me in a well-executed fantasy world, even though I\'m not a big fan of werewolves (I was never on Team Jacob).Many thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing this amazing book\'s digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest thoughts.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""what started off as promising went downhillquick.╰┈➤ first 1/3 of the book: solid 4 stars 😄╰┈➤ if i had skipped the spice: 3 stars 🙂╰┈➤the book including theknotspice: 2 stars 🥴╰┈➤ the spice alone: 0 stars. negative stars, even. jail.the spice wasknotit.it wasn't even the knot itself that was bad... it washowthe scenes were written. i amslightly?traumatized. i also traumatized my husband when i forced him to read some of the spice. at least i’m not alone in my misery.speaking of Misery...… really? that is, no joke, the name of the fmc. need i say more?i hope i never have to think ofThe Home Depot’sLowe’s strange, lumpy penis ever again.i am moving on now, goodbye. 👋🏻😌""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""This isknotnot your typical Ali Hazelwood butif you are looking for a furr-ociously good time…no, no, that's too corny…mount up and…wait, too suggestive…sink your teeth into…ah hell…Okay soBrideby Ali Hazelwood is going to lend itself to a lot of jokes and I applaud Hazelwood for leaning into them because at its heart this is a fun and rather bitingly funny novel that brings us back into the veins of paranormal romance that dominated the early 2000s. A forced wedding between a vampire and werewolf (a big, beefy, beast of a man-beast) in order to uphold an uneasy truce kick off this story of paranormal politicking and high-energy action paired with a slow-burn romance of an enemies-to-lovers plot (okay it’s not really EtL, it’s more like vaguely-distrustful to lovers) that puts a new meaning to the term “heavy petting” (pawing?). I tend to prefer romance stories that have a larger plot to hold them up, which is what we have here, though admittedly the plot is a bit lackluster and kind of conflates complicating the reveal of the politics and mysteries with actual complexity. Still this is a pretty fun read that highlights a lot of what Hazelwood does best in a very different scenario for her while also making it feel like a natural next step for her stories and I think this is one that if decide to bite in for some fun, you’ll get just that.Oh, have I mentioned the werewolf is huge yet? Big shocker in a Hazelwood book, right? I mean, when I saw werewolf man we all knew this was coming (and so is he…) but guess what? Misery (oh yea, she named her Misery lol) is tall, so I’d like to applaud Hazelwood for some character growth. Oh, wait, sorry, Werewolf Lowe is actually so huge he can’t even fit in their single king-sized bed (if you are playing Romance Tropes drinking game, take a shot for single bed) so you be the judge if its still her big man little woman trope (if yes, take another shot). But it is sort of fun to see a lot of Hazelwood’s signature elements here and I suppose this is the paranormal offshoot of her STEM stories as Misery happens to be a computer genius and that comes in handy (paw-y?) here.There’s a lot going on here and without spoiling much, due to some long feud and a lot of weird truces that tend to involve hostages and interspecieseroticapairings, humans, werewolves and vampires are all poised and ready for bloodshed and this marriage is another stop-gap in that all. Misery now has to live amongst werewolves (they go by Weres which…okay I’ll get to the world building soon but its not the best) who definitely want to kill her but shes so used to ‘feeling alone among people who were never supposed to be my own’ after living with humans all life that she’s gonna give it the old college try! Good for her even if ‘the whole rival-species-bound-by-centuries-of-hostility-until-the-bloody-demise-of-the-weakest-will-put-an-end-to-the-senseless-suffering thing might seem discouraging.’ Theres a slow moving romance as they move from utter distrust to relying on each other and Lowe being pretty damn into her while refusing to admit it and Misery refusing to notice that he’s pretty damn obvious because we need to stretch this already thin plot out with some romantic tension (drink). This is actually fairly light on the romance and the spicier stuff comes later and while this book does lean towards some omegaverse vibes it feels more a nod to all that than actually embracing it. Except knotting (take a shot). Hazelwood fans will enjoy this and they should, though I’m curious if those who might come to this from a deep love or paranormal romance might find it to read like a pop song cover of a deep-cut song they enjoy.This felt fairly undercooked though to me. In part because the world building is mostly done through conversation between Misery and Lowe, which is something I love in theory and found books likeThe Long Way to a Small, Angry Planetto brilliantly execute world building through picking up context in casual conversations between characters, but here the two are distrustful and all coy about revealing things. Its like pulling teeth because thats basically what they are doing to get answers out of each other and I found myself shaking the book screamingjust fucking tell me already(take another shot, not for tropes but in solidarity). Actually, Lowe is kind of annoying at times to be honest, even with his whole “tough alpha” schtick masking that he’s really a sweet sensitive boy packing a donkey sized dick (drink), and his whole “want better than me” thing was eye rolling. But anyways, the bigger catch is…none of the elements feel particularly fresh? And nobody wants a stale body if you are going to suck it’s blood, am i right vampires? A lot of it felt rather cut-and-paste or “spot what this is inspired by” which sometimes made me realize I liked the techniques better in the other books. Theres definitely a BIGUnderworldfilm vibe here, and the whole sucking blood being orgasmic has been done before. I didn’t dislike this book but it made me actually realize I might like Butler’sFledglingmore than I did before. It all works though, I just don’t think fantasy world building is Hazelwood’s greatest strength and a lot of the ambiguities work to ignore that a lot of it feels fairly flimsy.So will these two ‘live bitingly ever after’ or will the politics of their world crush them? It’s worth a read, and I did like the characters quite a bit. I do like Misery asserting herself against and “alpha” and him recognizing her as a strong woman with agency. The plot is pretty fun too with some good twists, and really I have nothing to complain about other than it just didn’t land as well for me as her YA book. It does seem to be both chasing a romantasy trend while also broadening and popularizing it so its sort of a publishing slam dunk and I think a lot of people will rightfully enjoy it. It’s left pretty open for a sequel, I’ll look forward to finding out from your reviews because I think one was more than enough for me.2.5/5""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'yeah, this did KNOT serve ✨️'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'i enjoyed this way too much!!! rtc.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""DNF @ pg 229- I'm out ✌🏾even the characters in the book were not taking the story seriously. how could I?""}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""it's giving jacob black x edward cullen (haven't read it yet tho)""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'brb, running to re-watch twilight + teen wolf 🙃'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4.5⭐️Ali Hazelwood has me in a fucking chokehold, as per usual'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""ARC provided by the publisher via Netgalleyi feel like all my friends who also loved this one, were all by my side here on goodreads, back in the early 2010s, reading all the paranormal romances known to man (or that our moms kept on their bookshelves). the nostalgia for books likeriley jenson,black dagger brotherhood,kate danielswere so very felt. yet, this book completely stands on its own and is a really good book that i highly recommend.and this book had so many of my favorite paranormal romance trope sets - forbidden romance, bonded fated mates, and of course a marriage of convenience between our two main characters:➛misery- vampyre who has been living amongst humans her whole life, but finds herself as the key component in an alliance that will keep the peace with her people, while also having her own human inspired agenda for this forced arrangement.➛lowe- werewolf alpha who is still asserting his new dominance over his people, while also trying to assess who he can trust or not, while also being an amazing caretaker for his little sister.“I would take anything she chose to give me—the tiniest fraction or her entire world.

Il clan Caskey è dilaniato dalla spietata lotta tra Mary-Love ed Elinor. Ma all'orizzonte si allungano altre ombre: sui legami, sui patrimoni, sulle anime. E le ripercussioni varcheranno i confini dell’immaginazione.

Vuelvo a insistir en que no es una serie de seis novelas sino una única novela editada en seis entregas. Esta tercera le da una vuelta de tuerca a las dos anteriores.McDowell nos mete de lleno en los problemas y disputas familiares de los Caskey. El tiempo avanza y, cuando nos queremos dar cuenta, ya han pasado diecisiete años desde que Elinor y Óscar se casaron. Vamos a conocer mejor a Miriam y Frances, las dos hijas del matrimonio al tiempo que asistimos a la evolución de otros personajes como Queenie, sus hijos y Sister. Mary Love sigue haciendo de Mary Love. Su rivalidad con Elinor alcanza aquí su momento culminante. El giro que da la novela no lo esperaba y me ha dejado descolocada y expectante.El estilo sigue siendo el mismo. Prosa directa, diálogos atractivos y la maestría que le caracteriza a la hora de dosificar información e intriga. El ritmo es ágil y engancha. La leí de un tirón y estoy deseando la cuarta parte. Me maravilla la capacidad de McDowell para ponernos delante de una novela de terror y tocar al mismo tiempo otros palillos. Consigue que nos centremos en lo cotidiano, dosifica lo paranormal y cuando menos te lo esperas te sacude con una escena que pone los pelos de punta.Final nuevamente a cuchillo por las razones que comenté al principio. Deja con ganas de mucho más. Las piezas están en liza y tras el giro inesperado de los acontecimientos afrontamos la segunda mitad de la novela. Menos mal que no nos hacen esperar mucho entre cada entrega.En conclusión. Una saga con el sello de McDowell. Trama interesante, buena ambientación y mejores personajes. Recomendable.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Part 3 of the Blackwater saga is intense. Previous plot threads are aligning, tensions have never been more high and there's creepiness throughout. The intriguing build-up of the previous two books are proving worthwhile now that McDowell is taking full advantage of the festering family drama and eerie setting. I still can't decide if this epic is the greatest thing ever or an unreasonably long (but good) tale. So far leaning toward the greatest thing ever, but we'll have to see what the remaining 3 books have in store!""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '""All deaths are sudden, no matter how gradual the dying may be.""4.5 ⭐\'sInitial ThoughtsRight in the middle of the Easter holidays and I\'m pushed for time. So making an effort to cut down on the amount I\'m spending on book reviews. That last one was an epic Tolstoy would have been proud of and my daughter was going hungry while I was one digit typing away on my phone.\'The House\' by the late, great Michael MCDowell is the third installment in his absolutely fantastic Blackwater saga. Its a creepy and deliciously intricate southern gothic tale that contains the authors trademark flowing prose that transports you to a different place and time. Set in the early 1900\'s it follows the affluent and extremely upperclassCaskey familyover an extensive period of time. It\'s got the every day strife that MCDowell does so well along with some occasional scenes of outright horror! And so far I\'m enjoying it immensely.Which begs the question, why have I left it so long since reading the last instalmentThe Levee? To be honest I like to break up a series when reading it, to kind of savour the moment and prevent boredom setting in. But being completely honest I left this one way too long. If anyone wants to slap me in the face for this serious offence then feel free. I fully deserve it and might just enjoy it.And before we begin. If you are reading this review I\'m assuming you\'ve read the first two books in the series. And if you haven\'t, stop bloody reading this and start bloody reading those. Then come back and finish bloody reading this, of course.The StoryIt is now 1929 and the Caskeys are still the big cheese in the town of Perdido, Alabama. The depression has hit, but the Caskeys hardly notice with all that cash they have stowed away. In fact, the Queen of the Caskey empire,Mary-Love, is doing very well. Keeping things afloat while all the other locals file for bankruptcy is proving quite profitable.But still wanting to break away fromMary-Love\'sinfluence,Oscarasks her for a loan to purchase land so he can develop his own source of income. But like any true matriarch would, she point blank refuses. She knows that helping him out would pull him right out of her control and right under the influence of his medlesome wifeElinor.There\'s only room for one matriarch in the Caskey family, but who\'s it going to be? Elinor has had enough of Mary-Love\'s underhand tactics and these ladies are set for an epic showdown. The claws are out and it\'s no holds barred. But Elinor has a dark secret and I don\'t think the elder lady knows quite what\'s in store for her?Final ThoughtsDamn straight, I love this series. Why the hell did I wait so long to pick it back up. One of the great mysteries of life. But \'The House\' is exactly what you\'d expect from this author. Great characters, a tense atmosphere and a delicious plot that\'s carefully developed. It really is everything I want in a horror story and much more besides.For those who are sick and tired of the modern state of horror, with nonstop blood and gore with lashings of gratuitous sex, this is the series for you. Its subtle, emotional and eloquently described. You really start to feel like a part of the Caskey\'s lives and if you took the supernatural out of this story it would still be a great read.Dont get me wrong. The horror scenes are brilliantly done and because they\'re sparse, when MCDowell does hit you with them they\'re even more effective. There\'s one death in this that\'s described in such awful fashion that I\'d be hard pressed to find a more unsettling one. So hope you enjoy that!Yes, I had an absolute blast reading this installment and the series as a whole is immense. I can\'t believe it\'s not talked about more. Criminally underrated. So do yourself a favour and join me in finding out where this one\'s headed. After the way this one ended I can\'t wait for the next one...The War.Thanks for reading and...

Aunque reconozco que me sigue desesperando que las escenas de terror sean tan escasas y que deje lo mejor para el final, pero tampoco me extraña teniendo en cuenta que aún nos quedan tres entregas más. McDowell sabe darle el final perfecto para que quieras ir a por el siguiente.Me parece una lectura perfecta para los que no tenemos mucho tiempo para dedicarle a esta gran pasión que nos une.Son historias muy fluidas, cargadas de secretos y dramas familiares junto con elementos sobrenaturales que McDowell sabe dosificar a la perfección, pasando de relatar momentos cotidianos del lugar a describirte una escena escabrosa que es capaz de hacerte estremecer y dejarte con una sensación de desasosiego e intranquilidad por saber cuándo te dará la siguiente bofetada 🤣No puedo añadir gran cosa, al tratarse de una novela que sale por entregas cuanto menos se sepa mejor, ya estamos en el ecuador pero aún hay mucho que contar y múltiples respuestas que descubrir.Si quieres conocer a esta poderosa familia en una historia llena de secretos, manipulaciones, mentiras, venganzas y todas las incógnitas que rodean a Elinor, McDowell es tu escritor.Blackwater es mucho más que un drama gótico sureño, tenemos todos los ingredientes de una buena novela de terror; asesinatos, desapariciones, un gran caserón de la época en el que extraños sucesos ocurren al caer la noche, y por supuesto el río Perdido, cuyos efluvios siguen enturbiando al pueblo y a nosotros mismos.👌🏻📖 Los lectores hemos caído rendidos ante sus bonitas ediciones, con un resumen al comienzo de cada uno, un mapa con las modificaciones que se van sucediendo y un árbol genealógico con las bajas y nuevas incorporaciones. Además de que el hecho de sacarlas por entregas me parece todo un éxito.Pero también por su magnífica ambientación y el fabuloso retrato de una época en la que la esclavitud seguía estando a la orden del día.Y, por supuesto, estoy deseando saber más sobre ese misterioso armario y los oscuros secretos que aguardan tras su puerta... 😱🔝¿A qué esperas para hacerte con ellos? 🤓📚Yo estoy que me muero de la ansiedad esperando el mensaje de mi librera diciéndome que ya le llegó la cuarta entrega; La Guerra 💣💥⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️https://m.facebook.com/profile.php/?i...📖🖤'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Team James.

El clan Caskey se desmorona con la cruenta guerra personal entre Mary-Love y Elinor.

Para mí la mejor de las tres leídas. Ni un respiro nos da el autor. La vida de los Caskey sigue, ha pasado el tiempo y los caminos de cada uno se van perfilando.Al ser una saga, es difícil reseñar sin desvelar nada. Por eso, solo diré que me sigue fascinando la ambientación (ese río Perdido que hasta lo hueles), los diálogos (fascinantes en esta entrega) y esos toques de misterio y paranormales que intercala en dosis pequeñas (en esta parte hay más) pero tan bien colocados en la narración que no te los esperas y te dejan helada.Tremendo el personaje de Elinor en esta parte 🤫. Tremendo el giro que da la historia.Me admira que el autor consiga pegarte de esta forma a las páginas, que te arrastre por esta historia sin darte apenas cuenta y de tal forma que digas: Menos mal que ya tengo la siguiente porque la empiezo YA (cuando todavía no has acabado esta).

It’s the perfect Literature-Horror coagulation, with McDowell’s wonderful sweeping prose, combined with extremely rich fulfilling characters and just a hint of horrifying gore thrown in once every 150 pages.The Caskey family continue to be in fine form here, with the next-generation now with their hands beginning to firmly take grip of the wheel. Mary Love Caskey, the matriarchal figurative monster and Oscar’s wife Elenor the Literal one, their subtle southern-charmed battles reach their peak here just as the Levee is finished and well and truly a part of the Perdido community. Yet the Perdido river remains the true King of this Southern Jungle and whilst it appears to be angry, it also manages to to find time to heal as well..'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Oh vale, hay que reconocerlo. Cuando te adentras en el universo de “Blackwater” es prácticamente imposible dar marcha atrás. En ese sentido hay que reconocer que la serie se merece el boom que se ha creado entorno a ella, porque engancha una barbaridad. No sé si será porque, por lo visto, este tercer volumen que nos ocupa “La Casa “ es para muchos el mejor de los seis, pero lo cierto es que cuando cojo uno de estos libros me cuesta mucho dejar de leer. Ya lo dije en la correspondiente reseña del segundo tomo, no me parece que sean novelas de alta literatura, pero está claro que Michael McDowell no era para nada mal escritor en el sentido de que sabía cómo generar tensión y tenía la habilidad de crear una ambientación que atrapaba totalmente y una trama llena de giros de guion, trapicheos familiares y misterios varios, bien condimentada con una excelente capacidad para dosificar la información.La rivalidad entre Elinor y Mary-Love Caskell sigue dividiendo a la familia y marcando sus tempos, y más ahora cuando parece que las disputas van a ser heredadas por las dos hijas de Elinor, Miriam, criada, por su abuela, y la bonachona Frances. Además, el crack del 29 solo va a complicar las cosas entre la matriarca del Clan y su hijo Oscar. A todo esto, las cosas siguen su curso, aparentemente, en el pueblo de Perdido, Alabama. Excepto por algún macabro asunto pone dramáticamente patas arriba la casa de Elinor y Oscar. O cuando el destino azote a la familia cuando menos se lo espere. Y mientras, las rojizas aguas del Perdido siguen fluyendo rojizas, peligrosas y llenas de oscuros secretos…Como digo en el resumen de la novela (siendo tomos de apenas 250-260 páginas se me hace un poco difícil hacer estas sinopsis, para que mentiros ) en esta ocasión la guerra entre Elinor y Mary-Love llega a su punto más álgido, desembocando en un giro de tuerca que, honestamente, yo no me vi venir y que va a cambiar toda la historia de cabo a rabo de una manera que no solo me parece que va a hacer que las cosas sean mucho más interesantes y salseantes (que si algo tiene todas estas novelas es que tienen mucho dramita familiar )en los tres tomos que nos quedan de serie, sino que creo que también era muy necesario para hacer que todo avance. Como ya os he dicho, no me lo esperaba, y la verdad es que después de esto creo que nada va a ser lo mismo, pero ya tengo mucha curiosidad por ver y como va a terminar todo. Porque lo que está claro es que en este tercer tomo las diferentes subramas e hilos argumentales que McDowell ha ido tejiendo y entrelazando a lo largo de estas páginas que ha ido escribiendo, se han alineando hasta crear una tupida red de araña que atrapa irremediablemente ya no solo al lector, también a los personajes.En esta tercera entrega, la tensión está en el nivel más alto, tanto que hay momentos en los cuales uno siente que puede cortarse con un cuchillo. Cuando no es alguna extraña aparición, es turbio un asesinato o alguna disputa entre cónyuges llevada a su máxima expresión. La sensación de pavor que domina a los personajes, y con ellos a los lectores, es algo que surge de estas disputas que nos regalan cualquier miembro de esta familia que haría las delicias de cualquier psicólogo, mediante alguno de los eficaces y ágiles diálogos que son marca de la casa literaria McDowell. Y es que “La Casa” es una novela plagada de momentos de gran tensión que te dejan sin aliento mientras lees, en la que notas que el miedo va subiéndote por la espalda y convirtiéndose en una criatura cuyas huellas se dejan casi notar de una manera muy plástica. Nos encontramos ante la que posiblemente sea la entrega más oscura y turbio hasta la fecha de la serie, en la que los elementos del gótico sureño o el horror gótico se dejan ver en todo su oscuro y tétrico esplendor cuando antes solo se nos dejaban entrever o se nos en daban pequeñas pinceladas.Soy consciente que me repito mucho en las críticas que hago de esta saga, pero si tengo alguna queja de la saga “Blackwater” es que siento que te la venden como una historia de fantasía cuando en realidad es más de tensión y de misterio. Que en este libro están mejor ejecutados que nunca, con momentos realmente escalofriantes y que te mantienen en absoluto vilo, mientras lees sientes como el autor aumenta el ritmo y le mete más caña y terror a todo a máxima potencia. Y todo esto aderezado con los líos familiares de los Caskey. Porque realmente esta historia va de las luchas por el poder entre dos mujeres formidables, tan parecidas como diferentes entre sí. Quizás el odio entre la misteriosa Elinor y la dominante Mary-Love sea, en muchos momentos, lo más aterrador de todo este folletín. Es verdad que incluso este conflicto tiene un tinte sobrenatural que, al fin y al cabo, es lo que siempre flotado sobre esta historia, a modo de velo, pero al mismo tiempo es en este enfrentamiento donde, por lo menos para mí, se encuentra el punto más interesante de esta historia, y a la vez lo más humano. El choque de voluntades entre estas dos formidables y terribles mujeres nos ha dejado los mejores momentos a día de hoy, y se van a echar mucho de menos.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'El mejor de los que llevo leídos.Aquí tiene mas peso o importancia la parte paranormal y se agradece.Seguimos con las intrigas de la familia Caskey y vemos un desenlace a una de las batallas mas enconadas entre las 2 protagonistas principales de esta historia y vemos cuales van a ser los personajes que tomaran sus relevos, la historia de Perdido sigue adelante y no se prevé mucha calma, jaajaja.Valoración: 8/10Sinopsis: Las gélidas y oscuras aguas del río Blackwater inundan Perdido, un pequeño pueblo al sur de Alabama.

Esta novela gótica sureña es una obra maestra espeluznante y compleja, con la prosa fluida que por lo que estoy observando libro a libro es característica del autor y que nos transporta a otra época y lugar. 🌟🖤Ambientada en los primeros años del siglo XX, seguimos a la acaudalada y dominante familia Caskey a lo largo de un extenso período. McDowell captura magistralmente las luchas cotidianas de los personajes, salpicadas con escenas de horror absoluto que te dejan sin aliento. ¡Estoy disfrutando cada página! 😱📖La historia se sitúa en 1929 en Perdido, Alabama, donde la Gran Depresión apenas afecta a los Caskey, gracias a su considerable fortuna. Mary-Love, la matriarca del clan, maneja los hilos mientras el resto de la comunidad sufre. Oscar, buscando liberarse de su control, le pide un préstamo para independizarse, pero Mary-Love se niega, sabiendo que esto lo pondría bajo la influencia de su esposa Elinor. 🤯👵Aquí es donde la trama se intensifica: Elinor está decidida a enfrentarse a Mary-Love, y ambas mujeres enemigas desde el minuto uno no defraudaron. Menuda sorpresa me llevé conforme se fue desarrollando todo!! No lo esperaba para nada!! 😱😱La verdad, es que estoy completamente enganchada a esta saga. Personajes memorables, una atmósfera cargada de tensión y una trama deliciosamente intrincada. Todo lo que quiero en una historia de terror/misterio está aquí y mucho más. 💀🏡Para aquellos que están cansados del terror moderno lleno de sangre y violencia gratuita, esta serie es una joya. Es sutil, emotiva y bellamente escrita. Incluso sin los elementos sobrenaturales, la vida de los Caskey sería una lectura fascinante. Las escenas de terror, aunque escasas, son impactantes y brillantemente elaboradas. 🖋️🌕La serie ""Blackwater"" merece todo el hype que está teniendo. Si buscas una historia que te atrape y te transporte, únete a mí y descubre hacia dónde se dirige esta saga. No puedo esperar para leer la próxima entrega, ""LA GUERRA""'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Seguimos con la saga Blackwater, en este caso vamos a hablar de la tercera parte: La casa.En este tomo la trama de la historia se centra principalmente en la casa que comparten Elinor y Oscar y gira en torno a varios sucesos que ocurren en la misma, como una muerte, una larga enfermedad o un tiroteo. También tiene mucha importancia el miedo irracional que la pequeña Frances le tiene al armario de la habitación delantera, que hace que este tomo tenga toda la esencia de una historia de casas encantadas.La verdad es que esta tercera parte me ha gustado mucho más que la segunda y me la he leído en solo dos tardes! Me parece que ha vuelto a captar mi interés como sucedió con la primera.También sabemos un poco más de los nuevos personajes que se nos presentaron en El dique y, sobretodo Queenie, me parece que ha tenido una muy buena evolución. El resto de personajes han sufrido un duro golpe, van a tener que reorganizar la estructura familiar tras la muerte de uno de ellos y creo que va a ser muy interesante ver cómo evoluciona la familia a partir de este punto.A pesar de todo lo que sucede aquí, o puede que incluso gracias a ello, Elinor sigue siendo mi favorita.

La casa, el tercer volumen de la exitosa saga Blackwater, es una especie de culminación y explosión de los acontecimientos anteriores. Las conexiones establecidas cobran toda la importancia necesaria, el factor espeluznante sube decibelios en la trama y la aparente calma de los volúmenes anteriores, presenta sus primeras grietas. La casa es un cambio de marcha en la saga Blackwater, un empujón que alinea las piezas del tablero de juego en una nueva categoría. Las tensiones familiares están más endiabladas que nunca, la intensidad de cada diálogo se puede sentir en cada palabra escrita y todo, pero todo, se pone patas arriba.La batalla continúaPerdido sigue como estaba, pese a que los primeros coletazos de la crisis económica del 1929 empiezan a llegar hasta la recóndita Alabama. La familia Caskey sigue en buena forma, ostentando el poder social y económico del pueblo. Mary-Love Caskey sigue siendo el monstruo controlador que era hasta el momento, y Elinor, la esposa de Oscar Caskey, sigue presentando sus pequeñas batallas contra la matriarca. El temido dique ya está terminado, y forma parte de la comunidad de Perdido, pese a que el río sigue fluyendo, casi incontenible, siempre impasible a la vera del pueblo. Sin embargo, La casa eleva las apuestas en esta batalla, vuelve la trama más turbia y deja claro, ya desde sus primeras páginas, que algo horrible va a ocurrir aquí. Y, por supuesto, que las principales rivales de la familia Caskey estarán más que involucradas, por mucho que el relevo generacional empiece a verse y asomar la cabeza por el espejo retrovisor del Packard familiar.Turbia culminaciónSi leías La riada y El dique esperando ese componente más cercano al terror prometido que parecía no llegar nunca, prepárate para La casa. Aquí McDowell equilibra los elementos telenovelescos y turbios para atrapar al lector. La guerra psicológica matriarcal alcanza nuevas cotas, aumentando el factor sobrenatural y espeluznante mientras vemos una especie de partido de tenis donde estas dos mujeres se pelean con jugadas y estrategias que parecen (casi constantemente) maestras y demoledoras. La aparente calma, como siempre, precede a la tormenta. Y la tormenta, ha llegado con La casa. La tensión es constante, siempre aguardando el momento idóneo para clavar sus colmillos. Y lo hace cuando llega un diálogo, una conversación que lo cambia todo para nosotros como lectores. El momento de culminación — el primero de ellos, espero— que llega con este mitad de saga y nos deja expectantes por el (nuevo) rumbo que la familia Caskey adquirirá a partir de ahora.Choque de reinasLa casa es el libro donde la trama se complica y se oscurece más que nunca. El choque de las dos reinas, de las dos matriarcas que conviven dentro de la familia Caskey, ofrece al lector giros inesperados. Asistimos a un duelo de poder puro y duro, donde sus decisiones afectan una y otra vez el destino de su familia Caskey. McDowell aprovecha en La casa todo lo que ha construido con paciente calma hasta el momento, y tal como nos regalaba Juego de Tronos con Tyrion y Cersei Lannister, las estrategias enconadas y las conversaciones con dobles sentidos acaban teniendo resoluciones emocionantes. La casa es uno de esos momentos satisfactorios para el lector, una culminación que evoca el terror prometido. Todo, claro que sí, llevado a cabo con la maestría narrativa que McDowell lleva presentando en los dos volúmenes anteriores. Los monstruos, a veces (la mayoría), son iguales a nosotros. La casa es, sin duda, mi volumen favorito hasta la fecha. Pero claro, aún nos quedan tres volúmenes por delante para saber qué será de nuestra querida familia Caskey.

Maas's spellbinding A Court of Thorns and Roses .Feyre has undergone more trials than one human woman can carry in her heart. Though she's now been granted the powers and lifespan of the High Fae, she is haunted by her time Under the Mountain and the terrible deeds she performed to save the lives of Tamlin and his people.As her marriage to Tamlin approaches, Feyre's hollowness and nightmares consume her. She finds herself split into two different one who upholds her bargain with Rhysand, High Lord of the feared Night Court, and one who lives out her life in the Spring Court with Tamlin. While Feyre navigates a dark web of politics, passion, and dazzling power, a greater evil looms. She might just be the key to stopping it, but only if she can harness her harrowing gifts, heal her fractured soul, and decide how she wishes to shape her future-and the future of a world in turmoil.Bestselling author Sarah J. Maas's masterful storytelling brings this second book in her dazzling, sexy, action-packed series to new heights.","[{'rating': 5, 'content': 'Rating: All the stars in the universe""I needed not to be dead when I agreed.”“You needed not to be alone.”I don\'t really know what to say in order to adequately express how stunningA Court of Mist and Furyis. How exquisitely beautiful. How slow-burningly sorrowful. How... joyous at the same time. I\'m at a lack of words for describing how it truly made mefeel-- because this book resonates with my soul and my heart and my mind so wonderfully, it just filled me with awe from within, leaving me drowning in an eternal swirl of emotions, a ruin because of a mere novel.“But then she snapped your neck.”Tears rolled down his face.“And I felt you die,” he whispered.Tears were sliding down my own cheeks.This book is a story aboutlifeandloveand every gray shade in between. A story about the bleak days and the lovely winds of change. A story about hard-fought happiness and soul-wrenching sacrifices. And a story about a girl who finds herself drifting away into the fields of nothingness only to discover the stars and moon and night sky pointing towards her glorious rebirth.Feyre, oh dear Feyre. I amso so proudof her and who she\'s become at the end of the novel. She\'s so exhilarating and vibrant and incredibly strong. But she was not like this in the beginning. The events in the previous book shredded her apart from the inside out, living only a shell of the brave young woman we cheered for. My heart ached for her. But she finds herself again -- her true self, her wild heart, her luminous spark of daring, fierce, brilliant dreams. And the heroine that emerges is coated with sheer determination, powerful bravery and astounding compassion.I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal.I was a survivor, and I was strong.I would not be weak, or helpless again.I would not, could not be broken. Tamed.I want to assure everyone that not one character,NO ONE, acts OOC. And besides Feyre, no one changes. You know what I\'m talking about -- the alpha-males vulturing around Feyre. ACoTaR only showed us bits and pieces, but we mustn\'t jump to the wrong conclusions about certain people especially since the depth of ACoTaR felt (at least to me) similar to a Vegas wedding after meeting a guy in the hotel lobby, whereasACoMaF was a reality check. Harsh and cruel and unyielding.This being said, I liked Tamlin. He was true to himself. Everything he does, he does out of love and of fear of losing Feyre. And we all know that people blinded by love can often make mistakes -- and Tam did. Many mistakes. A lack of understanding intoxicated him and an imperative need for control severed his perception. Paradoxically, we get to know him better even if he\'s not a present figure throughout the book. And perhaps, now that we\'ve seen more of his layers and facades... perhaps we see him in a much different light. He has issues and I truly believe Amarantha messed him up mentally -- nowhere near the trauma Feyre endured, but still a haunting scar imprinted on his demeanor. Regardless, do not mistake all I\'ve said as excuses in his defense, because they are not. They do not excuse his ultimate authority, his condescending attitude and his infuriatingly rash decisions for which he does need to suffer the consequences.I just cannot wait to see him get his ass handed to him by Feyre.“He did—does love me, Rhysand.”“The issue isn’t whether he loved you, it’s how much. Too much. Love can be a poison.”Rhysand, on the other hand, was the epitome ofdamn. I might even have a confession to make... He might...*gulp*... have overthrown Will Herondale and Dorian Havilliard as my favorite book boyfriend!!Rhys embodies the highest standards for fictional males. His bad-boy allure. His arrogance. His cunning mind. His elegance. His astounding power. But these are nothing compared to his internal beauty -- his selflessness, his nerve-wrecking intensity, his carefully crafted mask, his turmoil and his kindness. His self-doubt brought me to my knees, because he is such a precious cinnamon roll and he doesn\'t realize it. Andholy shithis past was just too much --I WAS (AM) AN EMOTIONAL MESS.“You think I don’t know how stories get written—how this story will be written?” Rhys put his hands on his chest, his face more open, more anguished than I’d seen it. “I am the dark lord, who stole away the bride of spring. I am a demon, and a nightmare, and I will meet a bad end. He is the golden prince—the hero who will get to keep you as his reward for not dying of stupidity and arrogance.”And you wanna know what?HE\'S A GODDAMN FEMINIST. If that doesn\'t make you fall in love with him head over heels, I don\'t know what will. Plus Rhys is basically the hottest fictional guy ever created (Darkling + Warner + Dorian = omg). WHY ISN\'T HE REAL???*sobs*“Tamlin won’t allow it.”“Tamlin isn’t your keeper, and you know it.”“I’m his subject, and he is my High Lord—”“You are no one’s subject.”***“Maybe it’d be a mercy to be ended—A broad hand gripped my face—gently enough not to hurt, but hard enough to make me look at him. “Don’t you ever think that,” Rhysand hissed, his eyes livid. “Not for one damned moment.”***""She wins,” Rhys breathed. “That bitch wins if you let yourself fall apart.""Lucien remains clever and intuitive and even though his relationship with our heroine gets stranded, his only flaw is undying, blind loyalty and I cannot fault him for that.Moving now onto more serious topics -- the new characters. We have quite a lot, but by far the loveliest ones are Rhysand\'s Inner Circle.They\'re squad goals. FierceMorrigan; strange and kickassAmren; sassy, arrogant and skilledCassian; reserved and observantAzriel. All these, plus Rhys, entangle a dynamic that createsa family. I loved them to bits. Secondary characters, yet so wonderfully nuanced, three-dimensional characters that gut you with their own stories and make you shed a tear at how much they love each other. Plus, they cracked me up on a constant basis. And the respect and unflinching support they have between them was all kinds ofwowandawwww.Okay. Enough with the stalling. Let\'s venture into dangerous territory akathe romance.*deep breath*I want to start by sayingthere is no love triangle-- there\'s onlya wonderful, all-consuming and healthyrelationship that evolves naturally until it reaches paramount heights. I was constantly plastered with a stupid, goofy grin on my face whenever this couple interacted or was simply in the same scene. What makes them absolutely beautiful in my perspective isthe mutual respect, honesty and supportthey have for each other -- it paints them with anempoweringand downright heartwarming glow. Their amazingfriendship, their sparkingchemistry, their hilariousbanterand their hot as helltensionhad me repeatedly blessing the gods for Maas.“He locked you up because he knew—the bastard knew what a treasure you are. That you are worth more than land or gold or jewels. He knew, and wanted to keep you all to himself.”***“I’m thinking,” he said, following the flick of my tongue over my bottom lip, “that I look at you and feel like I’m dying. Like I can’t breathe.”Besides those strong traits of their relationship, I need to mention the steaminess and sexiness and overallHOTNESS.Because this book? It\'s hot. Like black-in-the-middle-of-July-in-California-hot. NA, after all. You thought ACoTaR was hot?YOU THOUGHT WRONG-- prepare yourself for hyperventilating, fangirling and swooning, \'cause SJM\'s writing skills slay in those scenes.“I heard every word between you. I knew you could take care of yourself, and yet … ” He went back to his pie, swallowing a bite before continuing. “And yet I found myself deciding that if you took his hand, I would find a way to live with it. It would be your choice.”I sipped from my wine. “And if he had grabbed me?”There was nothing but uncompromising will in his eyes. “Then I would have torn apart the world to get you back.”Oh oh oh but there are some other ships that get my blood pumping even though they\'re not sailing -- YET THEY SHOULD. They totally should. Mozriel and Nessian embody pure awesomeness.And Elain and Lucien will be so interesting to see play out!What I enjoyed tremendously about this particular sequel is how it managed to expand the realm beyond its initial borders, in terms of world-building, depth and history. ACoTaR now seems like a small piece of a giant puzzle, the lovely but common retelling ofBeauty and the Beastpaling in comparison to ACoMaF which, while just teasing us with glimpses of the real deal that\'s to come, contained a sense of radiant and vastepicness.The most special and bewildering aspect is the lush and vivid portrayal of the Night Court. Enthralling and contradictory, it completely enraptures you with its seductive tone. So different from the Spring Court (and Summer Court which we get to visit!!). But I expected something disheartening and equally dark, and while this mysterious court has that vibe and then some, there is also such glorious light and normalcy and elegance that reside in its spectrum. The Court of Nightmares gave me goosebumps. The Court of Dreams, however, gave me breath and life. The book centers in Velaris andohmygod this city! I loved Velaris with all my being and if there ever was a fictional place or universe in which I\'d want to live, then Velaris and the Night Court are it.Plotwise, there isn\'t really much to say, honestly, besides the fact that the king of Hybern is the new big bad wolf (as expected) and he wants to bring chaos into this world. But his presence is subtle, his threat only looming on the horizon -- the finale will deal with him more. Yet we encounter intrigue and secrets and eye-opening side stories and tales that create the legacy of Prythan hand in hand with the world-building. It felt similar toHeir of Fire, a journey of healing rather than grueling war. However, as in HoF, the last few chapters left me breathless and white-knuckled as I gripped the book to read every single word.Betrayals, alliances, resurrections, magic and evil marvelously unraveled in an explosive punch, a mic drop of a sort.It leaves you craving more the very next instant.We\'ll see more Nesta and Elain and Tam and Lucien in the next book, that\'s for sure. But the stakes are so high and the game of hide and seek between friends and enemies so dangerous that I cannot help but be in a continual frenzy until the sequel. It\'s going to be as much of a masterpiece as this one, certainly.A Court of Mist and Furymade me want to re-read it the second I\'ve finished it -- and re-read again afterwards. It made me want to live in its universe. It made me want to be friends with the characters, tell them how much I adore them and just how precious they all are. It made me feel alive in so many ways that it also rendered me speechless.But you know where its absolute beauty resides? It\'s in the cleverness with which it was constructed. Sarah J. Maas outdid herself -- with the loose threads, with the vibe ofHades & Persephoneand with the countless clues and hints that begged for a re-read of ACoTaR in order to pick them up bit by bit. No one can say she changed her creation to her whim, because it was all carefully planned out, mapped out ever since the first page of the first installment.“You are my salvation, Feyre.”A Court of Mist and Furyis my newfavorite bookand I\'ll keep it close to my heart from now on. Enchanting, clever and masterfully written, it shattered my expectations and raised itself on a gold pedestal. I love it completely and I hope you\'ll do so too -- as fiercely as Feyre loves the night.On a chirpier note though, I\'ll go drown myself into a hell of a long book-slump because nothing,absolutely nothing can come close to this glorious book while its remnants shine so brightly in my mind.ENJOY! <3P.S.:My headcanon fanart for ACoMaF:My Night Court photoset is a bit spoilery, so here\'s theTumblr link.My ACoMaF inspired playlist --The Stars Who ListenListen here:8tracks;YouTube.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'HOLY FUCKING SHIT. HOLY. FUCKING. SHIT.A COURT OF MIST AND FURY IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE.***CONTAINS A SHIT TON OF SPOILERS***REALLY, IF YOU HAVE NOT FINISHED THE BOOK YET, DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW.THIS BOOK IS WAAAAAAAY MORE THAN 5 STARS, IT\'S MORE LIKE 1000000000000000/5 STARS. I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE PERFECT BUT I DIDN\'T KNOW IT WAS GONNA BETHISPERFECT.To be completely honest with you guys, I have absolutely no idea where to start, so I\'m warning you, this is gonna be far from an actual review.May 3rd was the day I died.I ran to my mailbox, knowing what awaited me there. I opened it and saw the box, amazon prime tape all over it. I took it and ran back inside my house. I stared at the box and took a deep breath...THEN RIPPED THAT SHIT UP. I CLAWED AT IT, SHREDDING THE WHOLE FUCKING BOX IN THE PROCESS. I SAW THAT BLUE FUCKING COVER AND KNEW THAT MY LIFE WAS NEVER GONNA BE THE SAME. I TOOK THAT FUCKING BOOK AND TURNED THAT SHIT OVER. THE COVER WAS FUCKING BEAUTIFUL. SCREAMING LIKE I WAS BEING TORTURED IN THE DEEP PITS OF HELL, I RAN AND SAT MY ASS DOWN ON THE COUCH. I OPENED THAT SHIT UP AND READ TIL MY EYES BLED. DAMN STRAIGHT.So all I read in the first 40 pages or so was blah blah blah Tamlin blah blah blah Where\'s Rhys.And then the moment we\'ve been waiting for happened. The moment whereRHYSAND INTERRUPTS FEYRE\'S WEDDING TO BRING HER TO THE NIGHT COURT. FUCK YEAH.The Night Court is the most beautiful thing ever. Could it be any better? No. It was perfection. And when Rhys winnows with her there, Feyre\'s first instinct is to throw a shoe at him.THE ALL-POWERFUL, MOST FEARED HIGH LORD OF THE NIGHT COURT GOT HIT BY A SHOE.It was adorable.And Rhys helped teach Feyre how to read and it was the best thing ever. All the while training her on her new found powers. These powers came from the seven High Lords and Feyre has all of them.EVEN RHYS\'SFeyre became a very strong character in this book, Sarah knows how to work in that character development! She knew how to fight for herself and always wanted to be there to help in times of need. And the reason for leaving the Spring Court forever was because stupid Tamlin didn\'t let her go anywhere and practically made the estate Feyre\'s new prison cell. How symbolic. Remember that time Under the Mountain, Tamlin? When your ""beloved"" was trapped in that same cell for three whole months? How you didn\'t do anything about it and watched her rot? How on her last day Under the Mountain, you wanted to have sex with her instead of trying to free her? Ever think of those things Tamlin? Doesn\'t seem like it because now you\'ve recreated that same cell that\'s caused her so much trauma. Isn\'t he the greatest.When Feyre made the decision to stay at the Night Court with Rhys and the squad (who I adore so much by the way), I was so happy. Not just because that meant Rhys and Feyre time (whoo!), but because it showed how strong she\'s become and that she finally escaped the captivity of the Spring Court into the freedom of the Night Court. And she is a total bad ass.The Night Court squad is so awesome. We\'ve got Mor, Amren, Cassian, and Azriel who I love all equally. They all have character depth, flaws, and pasts that we learn about. Mor\'s past was devastating and made me want to just give her the biggest hug. I also enjoyed amren a lot because she looks like she could kill you and will actually kill you. And Azriel and Cassian are also really fun to read about as well. They are all cinnamon rolls.Let me just say, I love it when the girl saves the guy. In this case, it was Feyre saving Rhysand. They were flying and Rhys was hit in the back with ash arrows and was captured and whipped. Now Feyre, she wasMAD.She winnowed and killed the guys torturing Rhys like the total boss she is and saved Rhys from death. I was seriously so scared for my baby.NOW IS THE TIME TO BRING IT UP GUYS. THE MOMENT WE\'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR. WE WANTED IT TO HAPPEN FOR SO LONG. AND NOW IT\'S OUT IN THE OPEN. READY THE CANON.RHYSAND AND FEYRE ARE MATES.RHYSAND. AND. FEYRE. ARE. MATES.THE FANDOM RIGHT NOW.AND RHYS HAD DREAMS ABOUT FEYRE BEFORE HE EVEN MET HER. WHEN HE FIRST MET FEYRE HE HAD A SENSE THAT THEY WERE MATES. HE KNEW THE WHOLE TIME, AND IT BROUGHT MORE TEARS TO MY POOR EYES. IT ACTUALLY MAKES ME WANT TO REREAD A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES JUST TO HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW ON IT. AND RHYSAND REALIZED HE LOVED FEYRE WHEN HE HELD THE DAGGER TO AMARANTHRA\'S NECK.RHYSAND AND FEYRE ARE MATES AND EVERYTHING IS RIGHT IN THE WORLD.AND WHEN RHYS TOLD FEYRE EVERYTHING, (AND I MEAN EVERYTHING)...(LIKE REALLY EVERYTHING), I CRIED. IT WAS SOOOO.... I\'M SORRY I CAN\'T EVEN PUT IT INTO WORDS, BUT YOU PROBABLY FELT THE SAME THING. YOU KNOW.AND THE NIGHT OF STARFALL. OMG MY BABIES. THEY WERE AT THE BALCONY AND THEY WERE SHARING PERSONAL THINGS (I LIVE FOR THESE MOMENTS). AND THE ABSOLUTE MOST ADORABLE THING THAT HAPPENED WAS WHEN THEY BOTH WERE HIT IN THE FACE BY THE STARLIGHT AND LAUGHED. LAUGHED. AND SMILED SO MUCH. FEYRE HADN\'T SMILED LIKE THAT IN FOREVER. AND OH DEAR LORD SAVE ME, I\'M PICTURING THE GRIN RHYSAND GAVE FEYRE RIGHT NOW AND IT MAKES ME MEEEELLLLTTTT. I JUST SIMPLY CANNOT.Now, let\'s talk about the hottest scenes ever between my dear Rhys and Feyre.THEY WERE SO STEAMY AND I WAS FREAKING OUT THE WHOLE TIME. I DIDN\'T KNOW IF THIS WAS REAL LIFE OR NOT. AND THEY LASTED PAAAAAGGGGEESSS. A GLORIOUS AMOUNT OF PAGES. THESE WERE THE FELLOW STEAMY SCENES:COURT OF NIGHTMARES.THE CRAMPED BEDROOM.MATE REALIZATION. (THE BEST ONE)And Rhys is not who we expected him to be. He\'s sacrificed so much for his people like I can\'t even explain becauseHE SACRIFICED SO DAMN MUCH.And I seriously cried when he revealed all these things about himself.MAIN CAUSE OF MY EMOTIONAL TRAUMA RIGHT THERE.I could go on and on forever about the many many many precious Rhys and Feyre moments, but let\'s talk about that ending.Things were so perfect so far that I was getting scared. Scared that all that perfectness was going to be ripped away and I was going to be one emotional mess. And for a minute there, I was. You guys know what I\'m talking about.So Feyre and Rhysand acted like Feyre was under Rhysand\'s control the whole time so it made it seem like Feyre actually still loved Tamlin and that she wanted to go back with him. And then she wanted to make it seem more real. And I\'m like ""FEYRE IF YOU FUCKING TELL THE KING TO BREAK YOUR MATE BOND I SWEAR-"" And then she tells the king to break the mate bond. And Rhysand\'s screams just shattered my heart when he was about to. And shithead Tamlin\'s says ""Do it."".AND THE FUCKING KING OF HYBERN BROKE RHYS AND FEYRE\'S MATE BOND.I THOUGHT IT WAS OVER THEN AND THERE. I COMPLETELY LOST MY SHIT.BUT WAIT. IT\'S NOT OVER.RHYSAND AND FEYRE WERE ALSO ACTING THAT OUT TOO. THE MATE BOND WASN\'T BROKEN. I REPEAT, THE MATE BOND WAS NOT BROKEN. THE KING JUST BROKE THE BARGAIN WITHOUT REALIZING IT WASN\'T THE MATE BOND. THAT LOVE CANNOT BE BROKEN, ESPECIALLY RHYSAND AND FEYRE\'S. AND SO NOW THIS SETS UP THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD BOOK. FEYRE IS GOING TO SPY ON THE SPRING COURT AND SEND THE INFORMATION DOWN THE MATE BOND TO RHYS. YEAH FEYRE YOU GO GIRL.Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that Nesta and Elain were turned into High Fae. And Lucien is mated with Elain. Crazy, am I right?!AND FEYRE IS NOW HIGH LADY OF THE NIGHT COURT.I AM COMPLETELY SPEECHLESS AND AM STILL IN UTTER SHOCK AT HOW BEYOND AMAZINGLY PERFECT A COURT OF MIST AND FURY WAS. I CAN\'T EVEN PUT IT INTO WORDS. EVEN A GIF. I JUST-- WOW. YOU GUYS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I\'M FEELING RIGHT NOW. RHYSAND AND FEYRE ARE EVERYTHING I EVER WANTED.THE THIRD BOOK SHOULD BE CALLED ""A COURT OF PAIN AND EMOTIONAL TRAUMA"" BECAUSE THAT\'S HOW IT\'S PROBABLY GONNA GO. HERE COMES THE YEAR LONG WAIT. I DON\'T THINK I\'LL SURVIVE WITHOUT IT LONG ENOUGH. I WANT IT SOOOOO BADLY!!!!!AND I\'M MEETING FUCKING SARAH J. MASS ON THE 14TH AT THE CHICAGO BOOK CON TO GET MY COPY OF ACOMAF SIGNED AND MEET HER IN THE PROCESS! I\'LL MOST LIKELY BE RENDERED SPEECHLESS JUST LIKE AFTER I FINISHED ACOMAF. I AM SERIOUSLY SO EXCITED.I WILL SAY IT AGAIN: A COURT OF MIST AND FURY IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE.""To the stars who listen-- and the dreams that are answered.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Instagram||Threads||Facebook||Amazon||TikTokI almost tossed this down in disgust five times while reading this book. I knew, going in, that it was going to be a massive act of revisionism with regard to Rhysand, the villain of the first book. And as someone who loves villains and thePersephone myththat could have been something I could have gotten behind under the right circumstances. But I wasn\'ttrulyprepared for the narrative gymnastics that this book would perform to try to redeem him without really making him do any legwork. By the end of the book, he\'s still a sleaze lord, only now he\'s a sad sleaze lord in leather pants who was actually the heroine\'s soulmate all along and an all around Nice Guy. Pop a fedora on his head and he\'d probably ""milady"" his way through the Night Court.Big yikes.The beginning of the book was great, and very much in keeping with ACoTaR. Feyre has PTSD (understandable) and so does Tamlin (also understandable) and they\'re trying to heal and find the same love for each other that was the fuel for Feyre to save him under the mountain in the first place. The passion between them in the beginning was great. Feyre\'s misgivings about ruling also made sense. I could even understand why Tamlin would want to be so overprotective. He felt like he had betrayed her in failing to keep her safe and was overcompensating for it in the worst way by essentially treating her like she was made out of glass.Enter Rhysand, who makes good on his bargain to take Feyre back to his court for seven days a month. He actually ruins Feyre\'s wedding, where she is about to get married to Tamlin but having a major case of cold feet and PTSD. He tells her that her wedding dress is ugly and tells her that she should thank him for saving her the effort of breaking things off, because he is *chef\'s kiss* a prince among men. *eye roll* He takes it upon himself to teach Feyre to read and write and is so shocked that she was allowed to be illiterate for so long... which was kind of weird to me, because I was pretty sure that TAMLIN was actually teaching her how to read in book one?? Maybe I\'m wrong, but I seem to remember Tamlin teaching her to read was a major part of his introduction as love interest.Also, apparently Feyre hates painting now and is totally upset that Tamlin gives her a set of paints as a present. Because how dare he get her something that she used to like but didn\'t tell him that she doesn\'t like anymore. How dare he not be a mind-reader like Rhysand who is a prince among men.Anyway, things between Tamlin and Feyre aren\'t so great when she gets back. She starts noticing that he\'s really controlling but they never really sit down and talk about it. She whines about it but never discusses anything with him... and yes, while his behavior isn\'t great, locking her in the tower is hardly the abusive act that Feyre milked for all it was worth. It was bad, yes, but it\'s not like Rhysand was free of faults (oh no, we\'ll be getting to that), and yet his past was wiped so clean it was practically sparkling, while Tamlin\'s smaller crimes are portrayed as the Greatest Wrongs in the History of Wrongs, and you would think he put her up in some kind of prison camp for all that she goes on about Tamlin locking her up and Rhysand freeing her. IT WAS SO ANNOYING.The ""mate"" thing is really just a neat excuse to forgo any groveling while also explaining this seeming switch mid-series between love interests. We learn that Rhysand sexually assaulted Feyre for her own good, to keep her angry so she wouldn\'t give up hope. WOW, WHAT A GREAT GUY. About 370-pages in, he finally brings up the assault and sort-of-but-not-really-apologizes and Feyre merely shrugs it off, despite the fact that in book one, everything he did was infuriating and traumatizing to her, and she HATED his guts and HATED him for parading her around and objectifying her in front of Rhysand, drugged her, mind raped her, and even made jokes about forcing herself on her, but yeah, Tamlin\'s the bad guy because he locked her in her room ONE TIME.It\'s kind of amazing, really, how eager Feyre was to throw Tamlin in the trash.Also, like Celaena/Aelin in THRONE OF GLASS, it isn\'t enough for Feyre to be a bad-ass fighter on her own terms, no. When she comes back with the gifts of the other Lords, she comes back with LITERALLY ALL OF THEIR POWERS, and she is so powerful that people are going to kill her just to keep her powers from manifesting. Because a heroine just isn\'t worth salt if she isn\'t the Queen of the Specialverse, I guess. Part of what made Feyre so endearing in book one is because she actually did have to struggle to succeed; here, everything is served to her on a silver platter.I skipped over most of the Night Court things... they were so boring.Of course, Tamlin has to become a traitor. Maas basically did to him what she did to Chaol and Dorian in THRONE OF GLASS. They both become terribad people so Rowan can show up and steal the scene with his earth-shattering orgasms. I guess maybe even the author realized that Tamlin didn\'t look that bad, so making him into a betrayer was necessary for giving Feyre a clean-cut reason to dump his ass without looking petty. Also, apparently he harbors a sexual assaulter in his court, because in this book we learn that YET ANOTHER WOMAN IN THIS BOOK tried to have her way with Rhys without his consent, and Tamlin just keeps her around... because he\'s the bad guy now.We\'re supposed to feel sorry for Rhysand because he was Amarantha\'s ""whore,"" and yes, I do feel sorry for him... Amarantha was awful... but that doesn\'t excuse his own abuse. ""This is for your own good"" is literally one of the go-to phrases of abusers. He was AWFUL in A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES and he never really grovels for it. He tells Feyre abouthisabuses while crying, but that\'s all about HIM. He provides plenty of reasons-- excuses-- about why he did what he did, but this serves more to brush off his actions than genuine contrition. I wouldn\'t even care if he became her love interest as the villain if he was actually KEPT as a villain, but it\'s like all that brutality gets a pass because he is, in fact, a nice guy. Also, the casual story about what basically serves as an allegory to genital mutilation in his mother\'s court was super disturbing and mentioned like once, but holy yikes-- his parents were fucked up, and I felt like that should have been unpacked more.Lastly... the mental illness rep. Some people apparently think it\'s great. No. I don\'t think it is. Love basically cures Feyre\'s ills. While it\'s true that being in an unhealthy relationship can exacerbate existing mental illnesses and cause ones you are predisposed to to manifest, being in a good relationship is not a cure. You don\'t lose your PTSD or whatever because the sex is good and you\'ve found your soul mate. That is a toxic trope in way too many romances, and I can\'t stand for it. ALSO, what about Tamlin\'s PTSD? This was also never really discussed. Does only Feyre get to behave irrationally and have freak outs? That\'s an unrealistic expectation to have, and her contribution to that toxic relationship was never even discussed... because of course, Feyre is perfect.On second thought, maybe she is perfect for Rhysand. They\'re both selfish trash people.One of the crowning moments in this book is Feyre saying NOBODY HAS SUFFERED OR GONE HUNGRY LIKE I HAVE while a few chapters before she was hating on Tamlin for literally tithing his people until they starve. I guess she\'s the High Lady of Virtue Signalling as well. Fuck the poor people if they don\'t give her an excuse to hate on Tamlin. I don\'t believe they\'re mentioned again.If you forget how perfect this couple is, Feyre and Rhysand will remind you 2342342 times why the two of them are the Faerie Jesuses Incarnate who died and prostituted themselves for your sins.This almost reads like bad fanfiction of the first book. I really don\'t feel like Rhyand and Feyre were destined to be together from the beginning. I felt like maybe Maas initially planned on a love triangle but maybe thought Rhysand was too rough around the edges, and so worked double-time trying to find reasons to excuse all of his behavior and make him supes enamored with the heroine.The greatest death in this series wasn\'t Junian\'s or Amarantha\'s... it was Tamlin\'s character.It isn\'t even like Rhysand is perfect in this book. His flirting is literally saying things to Feyre that most men would get slapped for. He talks to her like one of those sexist asshats inMadmen. He\'s constantly talking about her appearance in a creepy way, and helaughswhen she\'s upset that he used her as bait for the Attor. Even their bargain, which ended up allowing him to read her mind, was done without consent, and he certainly doesn\'t ask for consent every time he reads her mind. At one point, he even says that he could rip her mind apart if he wanted. It\'s almost like this book was written out with the intention of having him still be the villain and Maas changed her mind halfway through.I really couldn\'t stand this book.Rhysand and Rowan are literally the same person, and their ""development"" with the heroine follows the same trajectory. It\'s not the worst book I\'ve read, and it\'s not even the worst Maas book I\'ve ever read, butI will never for the life of me understand why this series is so popular, or why some people who eagerly condemn other books for being problematic seem so eager to forgive or ignore the flaws in this one.Your mileage may vary.1 to 1.5 stars'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'When I finished this book,the mountains trembled.*Do I need to remind you to be civil? No, I don’t. Good kids.Thanks to my wonderful friendsEmer,ReyesandSarah(click to read their reviews) who helped me up this calvary, with whom I shared joys and sorrows, and who made me laugh so much I probably won\'t need to swing by the gym for the rest of my life.And a special mention goes toKaterina,NastassjaandVera(again, click and be delighted by snarkiness), who ranted with me in the comments of more than one update.Thank you. <3(I told you reading this book was so much fun.)---➤ The book, in brief:“Stop comparing.Stopcomparing me to him.”Because do you know what it is called when youkeepandkeepandkeepcomparing the previous love interest to the current one, and each single one of thesesugary,clichéd,obviousandtritecomparisons invariably leads to the conclusion that the ex is a prick while the newcomer is a Perfection Milkshake?No, Maas? I thought so.Oh well.I’m going to say this just once: it’s calledmanipulation.Now look at me, Maas. Do I look like a reader who enjoys being manipulated to you?No? Why,I thought so.To all those who still have to start this series and are intentioned to:don’t readA Court of Thornes and Roses. Spoil yourself a little of what happens there andstart with this one. Because -and this is the truly sad thing, as someone else said before me-A Court of Mist and Furycould even be enjoyable if the first book had not happened before.•I won’t go so far as to say that what we have here is a case of lack of “show” and an excess of “tell”, because the first chapters do show that Tamlin, whether for some PTSD or because he has always been a scumbag, undeniably acts like the worst man on the planet. I am even willing to forgive howcaricaturalhis behaviour appears. But, throughout the book, every occasion is a good occasion to throw in a comment tooverturncompletely also all the positive parts of him that are showed in the first book.(In this regard, I should say that inA Court of Thornes and RosesI did not care for Tamlin in any way, so I am not speaking out of frustrated adoration.)In this scenario, Tamlin is the epitome of all evil, while Rhys, of course, the epitome of all good: Tamlin cares for hierarchy, Rhys cares for family and nothing more (ugh); Tamlin wants her caged, Rhys want her free; as it turns out,it was Tamlin’s betrayal to begin the feud between his family and Rhys’s, and so on. I am not in any way saying that a man shouldn’t give freedom to his woman (it’s not that he should;he must, uncompromisingly), or that a plot-twist like the one I mentioned isn’t a good turn of events, even in terms of characterization, but everything is just sostereotypicalandtriteandsickly sweet.All of this,in the name of a ship. I think Maas should understand that falling out of love is just as normal as falling in. People fall out of love for normal reasons even if their exes don’t suddenly turn into maniacs.I am sick of this device, courtesy ofQueen of Shadows, and I don’t need the new love interest to be pushed on me: I am perfectly able to decide for myself.•I’ve seen some reviews in which these two characters are described as complex and multifaceted on the basis of their role reversal. Allow me to say that, in my opinion,nothing about them, in this book, is complex nor controversial.Maas did nothing more than switch their places and their personalities with them: Tamlin was the good one and turns out to be the villain; Rhysand was the villain (somehow, and indeed the Rhysand of the first book is the one I can honestly call intriguing) and now he is nothing short of a Fae Prince Charming.Simple as that.Besides,I liked Rhysandin this book, butI deeply missed the more wicked, morally grey part of himthat we saw Under the Mountain. He’s hot, sure, but he also comes off asflatand, at times,pathetic.•It was a dick moveto lock Feure up in the mansion, yes. And yet, I can’t wrap my mind around Feyre’s fickleness, considering thattwo chapter latershe says this:“I\'m thinking that I was a lonely, hopeless person, and I might have fallen in love with the first thing-thing? Now he’s a thing?-that showed me a hint of kindness and safety. And I\'m thinking maybe he knew that- maybe not actively, but maybe he wanted to be that person for someone. And maybe that worked for who I was before. Maybe it doesn\'t work for who- what I am now.""She hadevery rightto leave the mansion and let him stew for a while, but if that is the result of months and months of undying love, well. He stopped being worth of her love maybe, but I don’t think she fought for it that hard either, especially if he really was dealing with some PTSD. I think love is also about trying to fight for the other person even when they don’t seem to fight for us, to give them time, to give them chances, even though at one point we have to stop.It just would have been nicer and more enjoyable if Feyre’s affection’s shift hadn’t been so swift, that’s it.•All the contradictions. Feyre leave her abusive boyfriend, but then falls in the arms of a man who breaks every bone of a guy who called her names. Uh-uh. And if you say “He did that because he called her ‘whore’, and he’d been called whore too, and thetrauma”, I say: how do you know Tamlin’s behaviour wasn’t due to his trauma too. Maybe he just needed time. But it’s okay if it’s Rhysand that does that because epitome-of-perfection, remember?Hisbeing all possessive is okay. He can say things like “She’s mine” and snarl at people who so much as look at her. And don’t get me started on indecent exposure.•Thenew charactersare all nice and pretty and invariably haunted by a dark dark past. It’s nice to read about them and to witness their banters, but they don’t stand out as particularly well-written or sophisticated.•Theplotis evenweakerthan Maas’s usual. And contrary to what I usually do, I’ll sum it up for you: Feyre flees. TheMy Little Ponies gang- ops. I meant the Court of Dreams’ defenders (I know, the ponies were cooler) look for Things. Which do Stuff. Precisely, destroy Taran’s Black Cauldron and defeat The Horned King, minus the fluffy Gurgi.Well, wrong story, but that\'s basically what happens.In more than 600 pages.•People purr. Normal cats, thank God, ordinarily talk like freaking civilized beings.•The first timeRhysand and Feyre have sex and he climaxes, the mountains tremble. I refuse to comment on this thing, and if it was me who had written such embarrassing idiocy, I would be hiding my head under the sand. Moreover, allthe sex scenesare verycheesy,dramaticandover-written.•Lucien andElain’s mating bond. I swear on my heart I have never, ever read anything more ridiculous than this scene (oh, no, wait: the mountains). The passage from normal, rational person to mad caveman takes less time than a spark to burn. I almost expected he started hissing “My preciousss”.•And yet,I enjoyed it, or better, I enjoyedRhys,Rhys, his long, sappy, tearydeclaration/explanation(I have a thing for this trope; it could have been a thousand times worse than it actually is, and still I would\'ve loved it. I am such a softie, I know. My fault), theending, andRhys. The other things I pretty much despised. I also appreciate the fact that at least the author tried –and at some length, I think, even succeeded a tiny bit- to conceive a scenario in which Rhys’s cuddliness actually makes some sense.I still prefer him wicked.➽ To sum it up, what can I say? I read it with with ease because of an extremely fluent, even though not particularly sophisticated, writing style, and, as we all know, idiocies and mushy stuff can also be enjoyable, and truly, this book take the concept ofguilty pleasureto a whole new level. Nonetheless, I am sorry, but I can\'t overcome theirritationthat Maas\'s little games cause in me. She used the same lame and unprofessional trick twice now; my trust in her is gone, and I\'m wondering if we should expect a third time too.EDIT29/03/16: Ok, so I read the excerpt -as usual, unforgivably late, but this time the delay is due to the fact that I didn\'t know whether to read it or not. If you want to join the club, you can find ithere.What do I think of it? I simply think that making a protagonist goOOCwith three plain lines does take an inconceivable amount of talent.

I AM SCARED. I\'m totally open to the whole Feyre/Rhys thing, but I love Tamlin so much and I don\'t want him to be ruined by Sarah J. Maas! Can someone please tell her that she can make us love a character without ruining another character?Because really, I ship Feyre and Tamlin, but I will not be mad if SJM handles Rhys\'s and Feyre\'s relationship with cleverness.PLEASE SJM, DON\'T RUIN TAMLIN....And of course, WHAT DID SJM DO? RUIN TAMLIN!I tried to write my review without major plot spoilers, but there will be some minor spoilers about how the characters were handled. And warning: my emotions over this book are a mess, you\'ll se how contrary they are!Anyway... let me begin:OH, I was mad! I was so angry when I started reading this book, because it is in the first chapter that you notice that Tamlin has changed and not for good. Now he\'s an asshole. He\'s insensitive and controlling, I couldn\'t stand him! So congrats, SJM, you made me despise my (now former) favorite character in this series.I read a few reviews that said that Tamlin was always like that (a possessive piece of shit), but NO. HE WASN\'T! He was caring and protective, not a control freak. I feel that Tamlin changed because of everything that happened with Amarantha. Everyone comments on how Feyre had PTSD and Tamlin didn\'t try to understand her, but I think Tamlin also had PTSD. What he went through with Amarantha (and with almost losing Feyre) had a huge toll in him. I can accept that he changed because of that, but no one acknowledges it, not the readers, not Feyre, not even SJM.So that must mean that he just changed because he\'s an asshole (I\'m not buying it).My problem is that SJM wanted to force Rhysand on us, like she wanted to force Rowan on us in her Throne of Glass series. Excuse me, miss, but I don\'t need the love interest to be pushed on me. I can decide by myself. And the thing is... I FELL IN LOVE WITH RHYS IN THIS BOOK! And I think I would\'ve fallen for him even if Tamlin hadn\'t been the piece of shit he was.Before this book, I couldn\'t imagine any possible reason that would make Feyre leave Tamlin and fall for Rhys. Not after everything she went through to save Tam, he was the love of her life and her feelings for him were genuine. But then of course, the author put a lot of effort in ruining Tamlin, just so Feyre could fall out of love. What SJM doesn\'t seem to understand is that falling out of love is normal. It\'s perfectly fine. You don\'t have to turn a character into a bad guy for that to happen. Sarah turned Tam into a villain, and that was not necessary.I also hated the comparisons Feyre was always making between Rhys and Tam, so frustrating! They were so obviously put there only to make sure that the reader understood that Tamlin was evil and Rhysand was good:-""Ugh, Tamlin doesn\'t let me go anywhere. But Rhys lets me do anything I want!""-""Ugh, I had my nightmares and Tamlin never woke up to confort me. But Rhys is always there for me when that happens!""-""Ugh, Tamlin only cares about hierarchy. But Rhys cares about family and about his people!""-""Ugh, Tamlin doesn\'t let me enter to his room. But of course Rhys invites me to his!""...I MEAN, SERIOUSLY? We can notice that by ourselves, but Feyre kept comparing and comparing during the whole book.Have you read the Shatter Me series? It was as if Feyre was Juliette, Tamlin was Adam and Rhysand was Warner... the very same pattern! First Tamlin was a cinnamon roll and suddenly he becomes a bad guy who only thinks about himself and is obsessed with Feyre. And Rhys was the evil guy in the first book but then you discover that he had really good reasons to do everything he did, and he\'s a good guy incapable of commiting any evil. Gosh, I really liked Tamlin, but now I simply can\'t stand him. SJM succeeded!And I had other issues with this book... but that was my main one. I\'m afraid this has become the modus-operandi of SJM.Let me talk about those other issues... starting with Rhys. His character really intrigued me in the first installment of this series, he seemed evil, and I knew there was more in him than what he let us see. I knew he had his reasons to act the way he did, and of course I wanted to know why. BUT THIS WAS JUST RIDICULOUS. He\'s not justnot evil, he istoogood, bordering in perfection. He\'s a saint, he\'s ""Saint Rhys"". There is too much goodness in him. He\'s also the ""most powerful Fae ever born"", see? It\'s unnatural to be that perfect.Another issue was that Rhys seems to be the only High Lord that cares about peace and prosperity. He\'s literally the only one trying to stop the King. The other High Lords don\'t care about humans! The other High Lords are stupid! I feel like SJM did this just to add more perfection to Rhysand\'s character: Obviously he\'s the only considerate Fae that cares about the poor humans, the other High Lords are nothing compared to him!Now let\'s go to the other side of my review (this will be drastic): Despite eveything, I LOVE RHYS SO MUCH! UGH, SARAH! You did it, you made me fall in love with him! Maybe it\'s his good nature. Maybe it\'s his perfection. Maybe it\'s because he reminds me of Warner. I don\'t care anymore... I\'m just really rooting for him. I don\'t know how Sarah does it. Even with everything that bothers me about his character, I couldn\'t help falling for him.And it is rare when I change my ship in a series, but I did in this one because there\'s no way I\'d still ship Feyre and Tamlin after everything that happened in this book (which is sad, because I really shipped them in the first book). Now I can only say that I ship Feyre and Rhys SO. MUCH. Their relationship development was beautiful, everything they went through made their love more real, made it stronger. There is no love triangle here, there are no teams, there are simply Feyre and Rhys and I NEED them to be together.There were only two things I didn\'t like about their relationship. 1)The whole: I DREAMT ABOUT YOU BEFORE I MET YOU....Cliché, cliché, cliché. 2) The ""YOU ARE MINE"" parts. I mean, Feyre left Tamlin because he was possesive and controlling, but all those ""you are mine"" are not exactly different, right? I don\'t like that kind of love. It should not be about belonging to someone, it should be about belonging together.I also love Cassian and Azriel. Everything that happened at the end with them made me a sobbing mess! I just hope Cassian recovershis poor wings!, because if not, I\'ll just go to a corner and cry forever.Now let\'s talk about Feyre. Sometimes she infuriated me because of all the comparisons she made and because she was always complaining about Tamlin not trying to understand her, but she didn\'t really try to understand him, either. Sometimes she was really unfair with himExcept when he locked her up, I would\'ve done the same thing Feyre did. AND NO, I don\'t want them back together (NEVER), it\'s just that she made me really mad sometimes. But in contrast, I think she really grew as a character in this book, she blew me away! The scene with the water wolves was AMAZING. AlsoI cried when the evil creatures attacked Velaris! Ugh, stupid queens!!!...I couldn\'t stand it, it was painful to read. But back to Feyre, I like the directon her character is going.I can\'t wait to read the next installment! I know Tamlin doesn\'t have a chance of forgiveness (I myself can\'t ever forgive him), but I\'d like to see redemption in Lucien, he\'s a character with great potential and in this book he was just too weak.The world building was great, a total A+! I\'m still a little confused about the whole Jurian ordeal, but I hope he gets killed soon :). All in all, this book was GREAT, I think that maybe it was better than the first one, and that\'s saying a lot, because I loved ACOTAR. But since I had way too much issues with it, I could not give it 5 stars. I don\'t know how Sarah does it... she makes me love her and hate her in every book she writes! But it\'s more love than hate, I am SJM trash. She\'s QUEEN.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""I've never been thismanipulatedin my life.I was stripped off my free will until there was only a shell left behind, a puppet complying with her master's whim. This is the most vulgar thingSarah J. Maascould do.Allow me to elaborate.•In order to be candid, I have to admit thatI enjoyedA Court of Mist and Furymore than I expected, and found some redeeming traits that prevented me from rating it lower. However, I can't hide my rage and utter disappointment sinceeverything we read inA Court of Thorns and Rosesvanished into thin air. Remember the sweet love story between Tamlin and Feyre that defied immortal tyrants and resulted in great sacrifices in the name of their love? Well, forget about it. We were warned that this would be aHades and Persephone retelling, meaning the romantic relationship between Feyre and Rhysand would be inevitable. The way, though, Sarah handled the transition wasfeebleandinfuriatingto say the least. I don't think there has ever been a character moremistreatedthan Tamlin, with Lucien following suit. We get it, Sarah cares about her precious baby Rhysand, but her real talent as an author would be to make me choose him because I found something unique in him,not because she forced him down my throat. Tamlin's inexcusable behaviour suffocated Feyre, and I felt drowning and suffocating along with her. Since I couldn't possibly wish for her to stay in a mentally abusive relationship, Rhysand was the deus ex machina, the only one to save the damsel in distress, given that her friends abandoned her and her fiance suffered from split personality. Sarah dangled Rhysand in front of me, and every reader, sayingpick him pick him pick him. She had Tamlin and Rhysand facingidenticalsituations, only for Tamlin to do the wrong thing while precious Rhysand was the impersonation of right, of all that's good in the world. Tamlin locked Feyre? Rhysand set her free. Tamlin forbid Feyre from participating in his activities? Rhysand would always have her by his side. Tamlin extinguished the fire burning in Feyre and left her a hollow version of herself? Rhysand fueled that fire, and so on, so on. Now, I've been on the losing side of a triangle before, but always both love interests had some good qualities. In this case, though, Sarah served you the answer on a silver platter by annihilating the opponent and erasing everything that made the relationship between Feyre and Tamlin good and healthy. Rhysand was always sothoughtfulandconsiderateand knew what Feyre needed, he was her salvation. Of course he was, there was afreaking magic bondbetween them that allowed him to read her thoughts. Even the lesser fae servant in the Day Court would understand her needs if they were bonded. In every chapter she would chantRhysand is so gorgeous,Rhysand is so sexy,Rhysand is the most powerful High Lord in the history of Prythianyada yada.We.Get.It.Don't even get me started on the repetition of the wordmate, I rolled my eyes so many times I fear I might have a permanent problem.•Lucien losing his backbone and Tamlin turning into a psycopath a-hole were not the only character mistreatments, though.Rhysand was the victim of his own creator's adoration.In order to make him the perfect match for Feyre, she made himtoo perfect. Gone is the wicked, morally grey, complex character that intrigued us inA Court of Thorns and Roses. While unveilingthisRhysand, instead of finding shadows and darkness and lust for power, we found asappyand fluffy bear asking for love and affection. Everything he did was out oflovefor his friends, for Feyre and his country, and I fail to accept his reasoning behind his actions Under the Mountain. If you don't want the villain to know how you feel about Feyre, you can simply ignore her. But no, why not drug her, grop her while drugged and humiliate her instead?•Now let's get to the relationship between Feyre and Rhysand. For more than the first half of the book I liked them, with their banters and flirtation and the pent-up tension. But from attraction and friendship Feyre suddenly jumped to declarations of love and thenmountains trembledand she startedglowingand their sex scenes varied between steamy to cringe-worthy and more eye-rolling ensued (I seriously need to see an ophthalmologist).•Plotwise, I can't help but notice that some things were veryconvenient. You suspect the King of Hybern is preparing for war? Let's ask the monstrous ancient creature, who in the span of five minutes will give us all the answers, including the means to defeat the King and the exact location of the weapons to nullify his powers. Wanna convince the mortal queens to give you what you need? Write a mushy letter about your love for Feyre. The result is guaranteed. I mean, really?•Why three stars then, you may wonder. Well,I became very fond of the secondary characters. Mor, Azriel, Cassian and the ultimate Queen, Amren, were funny and caring and loyal, and I was actually more invested in their stories (which, to be honest, were all sob stories). I also enjoyed Sarah'slush descriptions, you could feel and breathe and walk the streets of Velaris, and the Summer Court. But most importantly, I admire the way Feyre's trauma from her experiences Under the Mountain was depicted. The guilt, the sorrow, the self-loathing were tangible, and the healing was slow and realistic. Her wounds would be there, and she learned to live with them. Feyre became a strong woman who embraced her gifts, her powers, her sensuality and ferociously claimed her place alongside men. She rose from her ashes.“When you spend so long trapped in darkness, you find that the darkness begins to stare back.”•A Court of Mist and Furyhad great potential, but I can't say I loved it. I'm partially sad because I lost some of my respect for Sarah, for shredding to pieces the characters I loved only to show her own favorites are better. I don't know whether I'll readA Court of Wings and Ruin. Before the last chapters it was a big no, but that final confrontation was the book's highlight for me and now I'm considering to dwelve into the third instalment to find out the end of this story-arc.To all my friends who loved this book, and I know there are many of you, please don't be harsh on me.

Maas??How dare you, lady?? How dare you destroy me like that and then drink cups full of my salty tears like they are fine wine?? What kind of fucked up sadistic witchy ritual is this for you?You annihilate me with your cruel imagination. And because I’m a masochist, I love it. Keep going queen, I love this kind of pain.So, I couldn’t have picked a better time to read this but the quarantine time; all I did all day was reading this; I was being transported to this amazing world that I want to be part of right now – the Night Court is my eternal home from now on.“Stay here for however long you want. Stay here forever, if you feel like it.”It helped my mental health so much I am at a lack of words to express my gratitude.When I was younger, I used to read a lot of mythological stories and even though the Greek mythology confused the hell out of me, I had this fascination for some badass ladies. Amongst them were Persephone and her story. Yes, my cheesy heart loved that, okay?Persephone was the Bride of Spring, but she was stolen by the God of the Underworld – the terrible Hades – because he was head-over-heels in love with her. But she hated him with all her being until…she didn’t anymore. She learned to love his weird-ass too until he became her husband.If this isn’t the literary world’s foundation for their enemies-to-lovers theme, then I don’t know what this is, I give up.Well, this is the exact thing that happens inA Court of Mist and Fury. Rhys gets to be Hades (duh, obvy!) and Feyre is our darling Persephone. My brain started producing serotonin once again because of that tiny little fact some now happy beyond compare.This book is a love statement. Falling in love – slowly, truly, deeply, madly in love. And hard. But heart-crying beautiful. And it is not only about two beautiful creatures learning how to love each other and all the states they get through to find that love.This book teaches of how to fall in love with beautiful people, beautiful faces, beautiful minds and beautiful souls. And most importantly, how to fall in love with yourself. How to cherish everything you get to have in order to know how to soothe your life and spirit.“But then she snapped your neck.”Tears rolled down his face.“And I felt you die”, he whispered.Tears were sliding down my own cheeks.“And this beautiful, wonderful thing that had come into my life, this gift from the Cauldron…It was gone.”Don’t get confused though. This is still a Maas work of art and thus it is still very, very extremely hot. I can’t manage to launch into an explanation of how hot this book is because it is on fire, okay? And with this, SJM makes out of this book a full emotional experience (an emotional roller coaster better said but oh well).All of my favourite characters from this series make an appearance in this book. If you thought you loved the characters you encountered in the first book, then wait to be blown away by the apparition of the Inner Circle. They’re precious, deadly soft babies that I would want nothing more in life for them but to be fed, warm, cuddled and loved.-Cassianis the ruffian of my heart, he’s big and loud and gives off this feeling that he’ll keep you happy and safe no matter what; just love him so much;-Azrielis the baby-bat-guardian-angel of my soul whom I love so much and all I want to do in life is hug him and feed him and protect him from everything and everyone;-Amrenis a scary old bitch whom I love for the simple fact that she doesn’t seem to give a fuck about anyone but she’ll be ready to defend her friends if it comes to it;-Moris my girl-crush of this series and sometimes I think she’ll be my ultimate wine-drinking bestie; I love her to death;“A queen – a queen who bowed to no one, a queen who had faced them all down and triumphed. A queen who owned her body, her life, her destiny and never apologized for it.”All those weirdos are like a big, fat present for me, wrapped up in colourful paper and with a bow tied on top. I don’t know how I managed to go on with my life before I learned about their existence.Now, moving on to more serious, adult-like topics, I want to confess one thing: this book is extremely sensual. It really goes places and I went with it like in trance. The level of sexiness explored here is so intense that it could be made a masterpiece of sensually falling in love. And this is mainly because ofRhys.In this book, I honestly cared more about Rhys than I cared about all of the characters inA Court of Thorns and Roses. He is the sexiest thing I’ve ever encountered in my life and with this, I have discovered, he’s my type of man, no questions asked.“I have known many High Lords. Cruel ones, cunning ones, weak ones, powerful ones. But never one that dreamed. Not as he does.”It feels like he’s having his own personalised gravitational system and we simply happen to fly around like thebăgători-de-seamăthat we are, if I’m allowed to express myself as Romanian as possible.Rhysand and Feyre's falling in love journey is one of the most beautiful love stories this world could read about. It is so warm, but also so crushing. I love it. It’s like a most beautifully painted love dream.By the end ofthis– *vaguely gesturing towards everything ACOMAF is*– I felt tired, hurt and blurry-sighted. And truth be said, a bitsobby(a bit more). I’ve been hurt to my core.But I loved this book so much, honestly. And I’m thankful for the fact that it exists for me to read it.“We were a song that had been sung from the very first ember of light in the world.”""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '❝I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal. I was a survivor, and I was strong. I would not be weak, or helpless again. I would not, could not be broken. Tamed.❞A Court of Thorns and Roses was one of the first books I started reading that got me into Fantasy and reviewing books. Way back when this series, the Throne of Glass series, and Sarah J. Maas, herself, wasn\'t hyped up like there\'s no tomorrow. It was the first book I\'ve read by Sarah J. Maas and the reason I picked up the Throne of Glass series because I just needed more SJM in my life.I was satisfied with the way things ended in ACOTAR so when I heard that some ""changes"" were going to be made in A Court of Mist and Fury, I was a little disappointed. I was NOT a fan of the changes that were made in the Throne of Glass series which was why I haven\'t picked up Queen of Shadows yet even though the book has been sitting on my shelf since the day it\'s been released. That\'s just my opinion. I know some SJM fans are going to start pouncing because they sincerely believe that Sarah could absolutely do no wrong. Don\'t get me wrong, I LOVE SARAH J. MAAS. She is an outstanding author. I love her writing, her characters, and the world that she brings to life. It was her books that changed my perspective on Young Adult Fantasy, but I honestly wouldn\'t say that I agree with every direction that SJM takes with her books.I suppose the questions to ask now are: what was my stance at the end of ACOTAR and how did I perceive the changes that were made after reading ACOMAF?Let me address the most important aspect of Sarah J. Maas\'s books, this series, and probably the thing that majority of readers care about the most: THE ROMANCE. Since A Court of Thorns and Roses was a loose retelling of Beauty and the Beast, my ship of course was none other than Tamlin and Feyre. I loved them as individuals and I loved them even more as a couple. AND I loved Rhysand. Just not as a love interest. I felt like Feyre wasn\'t worthy of the enigma that was Rhysand. But knowing the trend that SJM follows in all of her books, I figured a change in love interests was inevitable. After all, a book isn\'t written by Sarah J. Maas if there isn\'t some character butchering and changes in love interests involved.But after reading A Court of Mist and Fury, I actually found myself accepting the transition in love interests much to my surprise. As much as I wanted Tamlin and Feyre to stay together, I knew it wasn\'t going to happen. These two people that survived weren\'t the same people that were Under the Mountain. They\'re relationship became such a nightmare and so unhealthy. It was two damaged lovers waiting for a disaster to happen.In the beginning of this series, I understood where Tamlin was coming from and why he was so protective of Feyre. It was for Feyre\'s own good and nobody wants to lose the people they love and/or care about. But he took it way too far. He became too overbearing to the point where he was holding Feyre back. We all understood the trials and suffering that Feyre had to go through but I feel like people don\'t acknowledge what Tamlin had to go through as well while they were Under the Mountain. It was nothing close to what Feyre had to go through but Tamlin had to watch the person he loved suffer and die. He couldn\'t protect her the way he wanted and he didn\'t fight for her as he knew he very well could have. He was helpless and a coward. I think he realized this, which was why he tried to make up for it afterwards by protecting her now to the point where she\'s being suffocated. It still doesn\'t excuse what Tamlin does in this book but he\'s just another damaged character like Feyre and Rhysand. He\'s just hurting in different ways and expressing that pain in a way the he views would make up for his shortcomings in the first book. Tamlin loves Feyre, that much is evident. He just loves her too much, and that is the tragedy.As for Rhysand, all I can say is that I loved him in ACOTAR and I loved him even more in A Court of Mist and Fury. I loved that we finally get a good understanding of Rhys as a character, the secrets he\'s kept, and the sacrifices he\'s made for the good of his people and his court. He was everything that Tamlin was not and twice the man and High Lord that Tamlin will ever be. I\'m not completely sure if I\'m 100% on board with Feyre and Rhysand yet but I love their chemistry, friendship, and the way they just understand and respect one another. I think I would\'ve been head over heels in love with Feyre and Rhys instantly as a couple if ACOTAR never happened and I didn\'t get so attached to Feyre and Tamlin. But I no longer ship Tamlin/Feyre and I\'m slowly, but surely, beginning to fall in love with Rhysand and Feyre little by little.With romance aside, everything about A Court of Mist and Fury turned out every bit as great as I anticipated a year ago. Sarah J. Maas did not disappoint. I was preparing myself for the worst but instead I got the best. Sarah really knows how to capture her audience with her writing, worldbuilding, and characters that she has created. Of all the new things that were introduced in this book, the new characters of the Night Court were definitely my favorite. I thought the Spring Court was great in ACOTAR with characters like Lucien and Alis but the Night Court was at a whole new level with Cassian, Azriel, Morrigan, and Amren. BADASS is literally an understatement describing these new characters.Besides Rhysand and Feyre, ACOMAF introduced so many new ships and I can\'t handle all the perfectness that everyone is. I now ship Mor and Azriel with all of my being, just putting it out there. XD And Cassian and Nesta. And Lucian and Elain. None for you Tamlin.Overall, I was glad I waited to read A Court of Mist and Fury because as a result, I was able to dive into the story with an open mind about the changes that were going to be made in terms of romance and the direction that Sarah J. Maas was taking the series. Love her or hate her, Sarah can write one hell of a story and is such an outstanding author. Although there were some parts of the book that went by a little slow, I think A Court of Mist and Fury was even better than ACOTAR in more ways than one. Sometimes I find that sequels may suffer ""middle book syndrome"" but ACOMAF amplifies that momentum knowing that Sarah is preparing to hurtle anticipation and suffering our way for the conclusion of the A Court of Thorns and Roses trilogy.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal.I was a survivor, and I was strong.Oh damn. That was so unexpectedly good. And to think I almost didn\'t take a chance on this after not loving the first book...So, here it is: I present to you7 reasons why this book is a million times better thanA Court of Thorns and Roses.1) Less romance.Oh, don\'t worry, there\'s romance. There\'slusty, slow-build, flirtatious romancethat somehow manages to be completely absent from the first book, even though romance was more central to the plot. But there\'s also so many other things here. It\'s a fantasy with romantic elements, not the other way around.I always say I tend to become more invested in love stories when they\'re subplots and the book itself is not actuallyaboutthe love story. I like it when the characters come together around and between all the rest of the action and drama. That\'s what\'s happening here. Because there is a whole shitstorm of other things going on - which, by the way, has led tobetter world-building, more exciting action and reveals, and a fascinating overarching story.2) Feyre\'s growth and development.And, in fact, the growth and development of many characters. Maas spends some quality time on character histories and backstory to strengthen our understanding of them. I absolutely love it when characters show realistic growth over time and I think that\'s especially important with Feyre here.Feyre is not the character she was duringA Court of Thorns and Roses. How could she be after the events of that book? Naturally, she has changed and found that her needs and aspirations have changed too. Once upon a time, back when she was weak and starving, she longed for a strong protector like Tamlin. Now she is strong, and she needs freedom to train her newfound strengths.3) I hate Tamlin.Honestly, if you happen to be a diehard Tamlin fan, I can see this book being a huge disappointment. Luckily for me, I pretty much despised him. He\'s never been anything but apretty-faced control freak. I\'m glad Feyre has seen that and rebelled against it.I should warn you that Tamlin is absent for about 70-80% of this book. And that was just fine by me!4) I love Rhysand.I foresee the ""oh no, it\'s a love triangle"" comments rolling in, but I really don\'t think it is. I actually think this is a great book aboutgrowing up and discovering that you\'re a different personwho longs for different things. I don\'t get the sense that Maas is trying to play out the Tamlin/Feyre/Rhysand angst; she is merely showing a young woman having a change of heart.AND can we just talk about how much better Rhysand is. There\'s all the superficial stuff like he\'sexciting, flirty, dangerousand I love the story behind him. He\'s more fun than Tamlin and I like fun. His banter is wonderful. But I\'m also talking about a more important level. Rhysand is, despite being the ""bad boy"", thoughtful and selfless. He doesn\'t want to stifle Feyre\'s strength and lock her away for her own protection - he wants her at his side, an equal, a partner in crime. And I love that so much.I like men who see value in strong women.5) Less sexual.I\'m sorry, you horny readers, but I just need to put this out there:I really dislike Maas\' sex scenes. Maybe Tamlin had something to do with it but, in general, I think they\'re overwritten and melodramatic. I also think she does a lot of ""telling"" you that it\'s hot, instead of ""showing"" how it is, which is a common writing mistake, but is far worse when in a sex scene. It\'s unconvincing.And by ""overwritten"", I mean that she describes kissing as ""branding"", thrusts as ""breaking"", and sex moans as ""prayers"". Literally none of those things are sexy. She gets the flirtations and banter right - that bit is hotter than the actual sex - but I start to cringe when the clothes come off.A brush of his tongue against the seam of my lips had me opening fully for him, and he swept in, claiming me, branding me.Also, is it really necessary for the male characters to ""growl in approval"" during sex? Not just once - and arguably one growl is one too many - but several times. I\'m supposed to be fanning myself with desire and all I can think about isRoy Orbison\'s Pretty Woman.Mercy. Rawr.6) New characters.A Court of Mist and Furyintroduces many new characters, and the difference between this book and the first is that I found them all memorable, not just the main three characters. Maas has definitely not neglected her characterization and character detailing here. Everyone who comes in and out of the novel has an important purpose, is fleshed out with personality and history, and makes an impact.My favourite was Amren, but I also loved Cassian and Azriel. Our brief introductions to the Bone Carver and the Weaver were highlights too.7) The ending.Take note: this is how to ensure your reader needs to get their hands on the next book. It\'s not a cliffhanger, but it is still EVIL. In the best possible way. I loved everything about it. It\'s the kind of emotional high that leaves you somewhere between wide-eyed horror and smiling gleefully.How will I last a whole year?Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube|Store'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Well, well, well. How the turns have tabled.ACOTAR was, uh...not my favorite book in the world.But there are no words to describe how much better ACOMAF is.All the problems I had with the first book were fixed. The story got bigger and more epic. The romance improved dramatically. And I fell in love with all the characters.This review has spoilers for the first book. Spoilers for ACOMAF will be boxed off with siren emojis (🚨).After the events Under the Mountain, Feyre is understandably traumatized. She saved Tamlin and the Spring Court at the cost of her own mental health. She had to kill innocent Fae to save him. And now she can\'t look at the color red without getting flashbacks. She wakes up every night to throw up.And Tamlin isn\'t helping.He\'s extremely protective of her after Amarantha killed her, even though Feyre was brought back stronger than ever as a High Fae. He doesn\'t allow her to talk to her family or to leave Spring Court land. He goes as far as to lock her in the house so she won\'t try to help the recovery effort in Prythian.And that\'s when she breaks. She calls out for anyone to save her, and Rhysand hears her through the bond, taking her to the Night Court to ride out the storm. But along the way, she realizes that she is more than a figurehead. She has powers, given to her by the High Lords when her body was remade. This book is essentially Feyre\'s journey to finding and accepting herself with Rhysand\'s help.Rhysand, High Lord of the Night Court, is not as he seems. In ACOTAR, we saw the facade he put on so Amarantha didn\'t get suspicious. But the real Rhys is a haunted, traumatized character who hates himself and feels worthless. He\'s exactly like Feyre. An excuse for Rhysand\'s past behavior is given, and it actually makes sense.Their journey to discovering themselves is beautiful, touching, and heartbreaking. And while I do hate Tamlin for being so heartless to Feyre, I can see where he\'s coming from and I don\'t think we should treat him like a villain.He\'s protective of Feyre because he saw her die, and he\'s absolutely terrified of that happening again. So he protects her the only way he knows how--by shutting her inside and not letting anyone see her. And it drives Feyre mad. I think there should have been a Tamlin redemption arc, and I really want to see Tamlin recovering from his PTSD as well. Because they\'re both suffering and they both deserve help. I don\'t want Tamlin to become the villain.However, the signs of emotional abuse and possible physical abuse are clearly evident.- Claws come out whenever Feyre confronts him- Makes her PTSD worse by locking her inside, giving her flashbacks to Under the Mountain- Doesn\'t take her opinions seriously- Doesn\'t listen to her, or kisses her or something to make her shut up- Gives her no responsibilitiesThe mental health rep was outstanding. Tamlin\'s rep was kind of harmful, but Feyre\'s was so raw and emotional and real.She didn\'t recover from her trauma because of love.She recovered because of friendship, and because people actually listened to her and took her seriously. Love was just a side effect.It\'s really the little things that helped. Feyre comforting Rhys during his nightmares and realizing that they were alike. Mor wearing blue instead of her favorite color (red) when she first meets Feyre. The Court of Dreams giving Feyre time to recover when she has a panic attack.The one thing I think this book needs is more diversity. Everyone was white except for this one guy that showed up for two chapters. The caucacity.🚨🚨🚨SPOILERS AHEAD🚨🚨🚨I did not like Rhysand\'s character after Feyre discovered the mating bond.This may have something to do with the fact that I don\'t like the idea of ""mates."" They\'re essentially soulmates, if you\'re not familiar with SJM. I always felt uncomfortable with the overprotectiveness that comes with the term and the kind of animalistic ring to the word itself.I actually really, really loved Rhys\'s character before he and Feyre were mates. He was so suave and intelligent and witty. That is, until the mating bond snapped into place. And then he was insanely overprotective and I just don\'t like that in a character.🚨🚨🚨SPOILERS HAVE ENDED🚨🚨🚨Another rap, because why not.

There\'s too much that happened and (whew) I am just wholly overwhelmed with everything.We last left Feyra as abroken shell of a girl- she survived trials and the hardships but her mind wasn\'t the same.

I just want to fill this review up with the heart-eye emojis.Minor spoilers will be included. You've been warned.This book is incredible. This book is important. But before I get to that, this book was a massive, gigantic improvement on ACOTAR. They're not even the same two books. Or they are, but ACOMAF elevated this series to what it deserved and needed to be.The world was epic, detailed and grand and I never wanted to leave. Everything about it clicked. I was absolutely transported into a world that I became obsessed and enthralled with. The pacing was beautifully slow, but well paced and the build up was great.So, the story line picks up right where it left off, with Feyre and Tamlin being back in the Spring Court, and now having to suffer from PTSD and anxiety. I absolutely love how SJM explored this and showcased how they were both affected by what happened in the events of the last book.Now, I was afraid that Tamlin's character was going to be completely bashed and written off since readers were hating on him and since I really liked his character in ACOTAR, that had me worried. But as I read on, the progression with his character made sense. As much as I loathed how he became, it's understandable and true to real life. His PTSD took on a different form. Sadly, that form became more emotionally abusive, manipulative and controlling. It was almost unbearable to even read. It was ugly but it needed to be there.Feyre just lost herself. She didn't know who she was anymore. Her trauma unfolded in a way that changed her completely and led her to who she truly needed to become.I absolutely loved how SJM incorporated those aspects into the story and how Feyre grew and continued to beautifully grow throughout the book. Facing setbacks, but ultimately, finding herself and her voice again. That 'human' element made it so relatable and warm. And the depth that SJM went into for both characters was impressive and you couldn't help but be invested and feel a strong sense of empathy.But what I loved more than anything was that SJM showed what a healthy and unhealthy relationship is. What to stand and not to stand for, depending on the standards you've set for yourself and which ultimately, you decide for yourself. 'Twas fuckin feminist as fuck, whilst also incorporating what true friendship and a healthy and loving relationship can do for your worth. To ultimately put your wellbeing ahead of everything so you may recognise the signs of an imbalanced relationship.And Rhysand? I need him in human form. Sometime soon, universe.This book just has so many fantastical and realistic elements to it. I loved that we were able to take something a way from it, enjoy it, and I'm even happier that SJM decided to extend this series.

I understand how people would consider the sequel to be an improvement since the main character shows more agency and certain tropes are reversed, but the development was very on-the-nose and came at the expense of turning other characters into cartoonish villains. The writing suffered a lot from telling and not showing, especially when it came to the dialogue, where it mostly consisted of the main character asking questions which would result in the other faeries answering via several pages of monologues in order to tell the exposition and characters’ background stories. This would be fine if I cared about anything in the book at all, but I don’t.

If you have problems with swearing, do not read this review*Buddy read with my partners in disappointment:Katerina&Vera. Yay, we are freed from under the Mountain at last! And a special hug goes to my dear friendSimona(click on the names to see girls\' reviews) You were right, dear, reading this book and, especially, discussing it is so much fun, indeed.First of all, let me show to you a simplediagram, where you can see how the level of my engagement toward this book...uh, plummeted (actually I wanted to make the diagram more vertical, but, well, I am not good with graphic stuff) with every chapter until nothing was left for me to enjoy.And let me tell you it was a rather bumpy and painful ride.Now, let\'s clarify a few things:- I am not a fan of ACOTAR. You can see inmy reviewwhy.- I had few expectations starting this book... ah hell, I had THE ONLY expectation - Rhysand.-I do not hate this book, I dislike it.<----- I am close to hating it now.This review is probably going to be a mess of thoughts with no structure, so I am sorry in advance if it\'s confusing, I just wanted to splash out my disappointment.I liked Rhys in the previous book; I liked his darkness. I knew he was not evil and had his reasons to act as he did, and I wanted to know why. I wanted him and Feyre together. But turns out, me and Rhys are never going to happen, not because he acts OOC (out of character) - after finishing the book, I know that he didn\'t act OOC - I dislike his sugary nature; there\'s too much goodness in him, he is practically a Saint: hell, he is the Saint among Fae!“We are lucky to have him, Feyre.” I turned from the door. “I have known many High Lords,” Amren continued, studying her paper. “Cruel ones, cunning ones, weak ones, powerful ones. But never one that dreamed. Not as he does.”“Dreams of what?” I breathed.“Of peace. Of freedom. Of a world united, a world thriving. Of something better—for all of us.”Of course, the other High Lords are stupid, they don\'t see the war coming, they are not interested in peace and prosperity, only Rhys does everything, and no one wants to listen to him.Poor baby.And let\'s not forget he is the strongest Fae out there.Here—here was the most powerful High Lord ever born.The face of dreams and nightmares.Only throughout the book, there was more than one situation where his ""mighty"" powers let him down.The question: why make him so powerful, impossibly so, if a little bit of vulnerability could\'ve made him more real and likable, and suited the plot better. It\'s unnatural to be that good. He became a cardboard character with no backbone and lives only to serve Feyre, it seems.But, fuck, it wasn\'t even my biggest issue. I hated how Maascompared Tam and Rhys in this book all the time. I never liked Tam, but, seriously, how much shit you can splash on one person before he turns into shit himself? I pity Tam and what Maas did to him. Time and again Maas shoves down our throats how Rhys excels Tam in everything: Tam didn\'t want to talk to Feyre about his nightmares. Rhys wanted to talk and share. Tam never held her hair while she vomited her guts out every night (she does it a lot, by the way, nauseatingly so). Rhys held her hair and cuddled her:He never woke when the nightmares dragged me from sleep; never woke when I vomited my guts up night after night. If he knew or heard, he said nothing about it.Large, warm hands pulled my hair back a moment later.“Breathe,” Rhys said. “Imagine them winking out like candles, one by one.”I heaved into the toilet again, shuddering as light and heat crested and rushed out of me, and savored the empty, cool dark that pooled in their wake.Tam locked her up in the house and forbade her to participate in any action. Rhys allowed her to do whatever she wanted. Tam didn\'t let her visit his rooms. Rhys invited her to his;With Tamlin, he’d kept his own rooms and slept in mine. And I supposed—I supposed it’d be the same.I was almost to my bedroom door when Rhysand drawled from behind me, “We can use your room if you like, but … ” He was leaning against his open bedroom door. “Either your room or mine—but we’re sharing one from now on. Just tell me whether I should move my clothes or yours. If that’s all right with you.”Tam is starving his people. Rhys\'s people prosper (he probably gives them food for free). Tam said there are no High Ladies in Prythian. Rhys made Feyre High Lady of Night Court. Comparisons were in EVERYTHING like the author couldn\'t stop shoving up our asses how Tam is lesser than Rhys in every aspect you can think of. And all this is solely for Feyre to make it easier to dump Tam and switch to Rhys.Then there\'s Feyre and herlovesex life. Feyre said that she fell for the first guy who showed kindness to her.I’m thinking that I was a lonely, hopeless person, and I might have fallen in love with the first thing that showed me a hint of kindness and safety.But she can\'t - wouldn\'t - admit that it wasn\'t love that she felt for Tamlin. She, time and again, repeats it was love: she loved and sacrificed and then forgot the guy in two months\' time. I would\'ve respected her more if she admitted that it was lust.He buried his face in my neck and said onto my nape, as if the words would be absorbed by my body, as if he could only say it the way we’d always been good at communicating—skin to skin.Whyfeel guiltyabout wanting another male? But no, Feyre is Mary Sue, she can\'t be the simple girl who had a change of heart. She loved but had serious reasons to fell out of love.Easy-peasy. Heck, I would\'ve respected her more if she was an elite prostitute serving High Lords and choosing her next lover without shame or labeling lust as love. But she is a hypocrite and Ihate hypocrites. It leads me to my next issue.Feyre/Rhysand. Honestly, I don\'t believe Tam loved Feyre, no, they just had a comfy agreement: fuck but don\'t ask questions. Rhys, on the other hand, I believe he really loved her. What about her? No. I am still not convinced it was love from Feyre\'s side; lust - yes. Again,Feyre has a pattern: when Rhys was a bad guy, she hated him, but when he started doing good stuff for her, she realized how good he is, how kind (don\'t forget this all is in comparison with Tam like we are stupid kids and can\'t fathom the universal truth: Rhys is good, Tam is bad);Feyre doesn\'t ""love"" Rhys despite his flaws, she ""loves"" him because he has no flaws.Mr. Purrfect Perfection. And when she finally admits she wants him, she still acts like a hypocrite by saying, ""But I loved Tam, deeply, I just don\'t any longer, because he treated me badly (I still don\'t get how splashing some paint on walls and locking her up once is abusive and the reason to easily fall out of love)."" Did you love him indeed? I want to ask for the thousandth time. Feyre just says she loved him to find an excuse to fuck Rhys. And that leads us to theirmating bond.When Feyre finds out they are mates, she relaxes and thinks, ""Fuck, what a relieve now that I know Tam and I was never going to happen, I don\'t have to feel guilty any longer for wanting to fuck Rhys"". But before we cover the mating process, let\'s touch on the snotty conversation they had. If you still had any doubts before that Rhys is a Saint, believe now that he is. He is a miracle reborn. Attention: he was always kind to Feyre even when he was a dick toward her. He loved her already when they were under the Mountain, he knew they are mates, it wrecked him to hurt her; he was jealous of unworthy Tam, but Rhys was noble and didn\'t want to ruin Feyre\'s life. And that sloppy melodramatic speech of his continues for a whole chapter!""A Court of snort and boredom""as someone on GR called it once (sorry, I don\'t remember who said that or I\'d hug this person). And again, Rhy\'s goodness is shoved down our throats *gags*Mate.My—mate.This beautiful, strong, selfless male … Who had sacrificed and wrecked himself for his family, his people, and didn’t feel it was enough, that he wasn’t enough for anyone.Also, as we are on the topic... did you noticehow many times the phrase""my mate""is repeated in the book?!Hundreds of times! It\'s like a broken record player. I think if I hear ""mate"" one more time I may vomit like our Feyre-parrot does all the time.They fuck. It\'s a disaster of epic proportions. Mountain quacked. MOUNTAIN. QUACKED. Seriously? What was that? Some kind of cheap shapeshifter porn?Okay, When they are done, and I am done yawning, and we all move to civilized surroundings... wait, what the fuck is happening?!Rhys acts like an animal, he can\'t stop wanting to screw Feyre. Their mating bond makes them horny as fuck. He is so protective of his female. It\'s serious stuff among Fae folk, they could even kill if another male looks sideways at their females.“The … frenzy,” he said carefully, as if fearful the wrong word might send us both hurtling for each other before we could get sustenance into our bodies. “When a couple accepts the mating bond, it’s … overwhelming. Again, harkening back to the beasts we once were. Probably something about ensuring the female was impregnated.” My heart paused at that. “Some couples don’t leave the house for a week. Males get so volatile that it can be dangerous for them to be in public, anyway. I’ve seen males of reason and education shatter a room because another male looked too long in their mate’s direction, too soon after they’d been mated.”Faeries - cunning, highly intelligent, powerful creatures act as if they are primitive animals from a cheap porn novel. After Rhys loses some steam fighting his buddy, he goes and fucks Feyre against the table. Everyone outside hears and knows. Wonders! How civilized they are indeed! Are we supposed to find these animal games romantic? Does it suppose to be a healthy relationship?And this book is labeled as YA and published by Bloomsbury Children\'s!It is NA (new adult) or erotic at the very least!My next issue - the plot. First of all, let\'s not delude ourselves there\'s something more to the book apart from theromancemating.The plot is a crutch for the romance.Everything characters do, they do between Rhys\'s and Feyre\'s courting. And even these parts are poorly executed. Why, oh why, does Maas need to chew everything for us?! We are not stupid, we can get hints and would like to have some space left for the imagination.Show, don\'t tell.Show us through hints and glances, make us work for information; make us want to know! And the plot itself is primitive: go there, do that - monotone routine with no unexpected parts. 50% into the book and I have already known how everything would end.I don\'t understand the half-orgy scene in the Court of Nightmares where Feyre and Rhys were almost fucking while everyone watched. It was a distraction while the others were stealing something important. It\'s so stupid I can\'t even. Maas couldn\'t think of something smart for distraction, rather than thisdisgusting humiliating scene?! The best part is the ending, though. Why would mortal queens conspire with the King of Hybern? Because they want immortality? They\'ll get their immortality but will be slaves. Would it be worth it? I don\'t think so. And why demonstrate the experiment with humans turning into Fae twice? Wasn\'t one time enough, when Feyre\'s sister Elain was made into Fae? Why make the same with Nesta? Because it serves Maas\'s idea of making Feyre\'s sisters immortal and finding mighty mates for them. It doesn\'t matter that the plot looks illogical and stretched - everything is ideal for Maas\'s grand plans. Tam is a traitor because he wants Feyre back. Why, he is a reborn villain now! How stupid it is to betray your country, because of the woman who doesn\'t want you? Why villains in this book so villainous? Why there\'s no depth to them? Good is good, bad is bad. End of conversation.This book is 640 pages long. 640 pages of unnecessary descriptions of clothes, Rhys\'s goodness, Tam badness, Feyre\'s vomiting, mating, getting from point A to point B. 640 pages of parading High Lords to who I wouldn\'t trust to rule a swamp, let alone whole Kingdoms. Where\'s the smart and cunning in this book? And what kind of place is Night Court? Is it a mix of East and West and the modern world? Lace underwear, seriously?! Why does Night Court resemble so much human reality? Is this another point to Rhys\'s goodness? I have tons of questions toward this book, but I don\'t think getting my answers will somehow make it better. It\'s late for that.I wouldn\'t say there wasn\'t anything good about the book for me. Compared to Rhys and Feyre I liked secondary characters, and Cass and Nesta as a couple attract me more than Rhys and Feyre ever will. It\'s sad I am not interested in learning more about them in the context of this series.When I started this book, I practically had no expectations, and now I am angry. Angry at the book I wasn\'t even sure I would read in the first place! It\'s a new low. If this book was an erotic novel or NA, I would say, ""Good, we had sexy time"" - and move on. But this book pretends to be something different than it really is. Something more meaningful and deep, and it cruelly deceives people into thinking they are going to read a fantasy YA with a strong plotline and character development. They will be surprised to find an entirely different beast here. I am glad I am finally done with this series:no more, never again, burn in hell, book.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Re-read via audio!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '""When you spend so long trapped in darkness, you find that the darkness begins to stare back.""Yall... this book... this book and its hype... this book and its hype and all it\'s spoilers;\xa0had me worried.\xa0On\xa0top of all that\xa0I\xa0feared that this book, all 600 plus pages, would suffer a massive case of second book syndrome. I\'m so freaking happy to finally say that this book was AMAZING!As I do with most my on-going series reviews I\'m going to keep this review spoiler\xa0free. Since this book was broken up in several sections I\'m\xa0going to basically break my review down by that.A Court of Mist and Furyis the second book in theA Court of Throns and Rosesseries. This book starts off right where ACOTAR ended. Feyre, however, isn\'t recovering well from what happened to her under the mountain. It doesn\'t help that Tamlin basically avoids talking about it at all cost and he insist that she never leaves the estate. Being trapped in the house just\xa0wedding planning, with no friends, no family, and waiting for the moment when Rhys comes to claim her for their deal. Feyre is a broken girl the first part of this book. Not knowing where she stands or where she wants to be. So many things happen in the first half of this book, all leading up to Rhys finally coming to get her. That\'s all I\'m really going to say about the first\xa0section\xa0of this\xa0book.The next part of this book we finally get a lot of\xa0the answers we\'ve been dying for! Answers about Rhys and why he is the way he is, we finally get to see the Night Court, we get to find out so much history on all the other courts, and oh so much more. We are also introduced to so many new side characters... Which easily\xa0became some of my all time favorites. Mor, Amren, Cassian, and Azriel brought everything to this story! I loved that Rhys decides to surround himself with the best of the best, say F the people who don\'t see females as badass, and puts two fierce girls as part of his inner circle. Cassian and Azriel, be still my beating heart. I loved these two. What interesting characters. Each with such a unique back story.\xa0This part of the book was all about build up and setting the stage for the ending.\xa0This is why it took me awhile to get through this book... but trust me get through it, its so wroth it.The last part\xa0of this book... God give me strength! I don\'t know how I\'m even going to get through the rest of this review. This section of the book was everything I ever wanted! There is action, suspense, romance, history, and\xa0twist. Everything that was building up from the first parts were perfect set up for this to be a big bang. There were also so many things that\xa0I thought were minor details in the first book that\xa0turned out to be huge reveals in this one.\xa0I was also so worried that the ""love triangle"" aspect still hanging in the air that it would end up ruining things for me. I can\'t not address it, and I swear it\'s not a spoiler, but allthe romance in this is PERFECT. It\'s also why this book is so much bigger than the first, because it\'s so full of sexy fun times.This book is hot, HOT! I really don\'t get how this book is still categorized as Ya, I think this jumped right into NA. Seriously, so yummy! I have for sure gotten on the same ship as everyone else.The ending. So much happens. It was so amazing. Shit hits the fan! I did not see it coming. I knew one thing that was going to happen, because you can\'t not see it, but the rest of it had me on the edge of my seat. I kept screaming ""WTF"" The whole time. Like really, what just happened?!?! Those last two chapters though. Those last two chapters were.... Lord! Oh and that last paragraph! That last sentence!!!! Lets just say it was the most epic!!!I wish my review was a little more detailed, and sorry if it\'s all over the place, but that\'s how this book made me feel. A messy, disorganized, and a hot mess. I can\'t wait till book three.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'MIND=BLOWNMy hysteria is threatening to break me and I wonder if it is possible to die of elation. I\'m frozen in 35646 layers of disbelief and I\'m trying hard not to explode from the sheer impossibility of this flawless story I\'ve read. I read, read, read, and read until I reached the Acknowledgements page and knew for sure that I finished the best book I\'ve read in like... an eternity.The story is simple, really. It picks up right where it left off inA Court of Thorns and Roses.Feyre is living in the Summer court and is going to marry Tamlin. But things have changed since she has turned into High Fae, an immortal body but with a human heart: She has to stay by Tamlin\'s side and be his trophy, left with nothing to do but paint and plan her wedding with Tamlin, High Lord of the Spring Court. As she grapples with the horrors she\'s had to endure Under The Mountain against Amarantha, she also awaits Rhysand, with whom she struck a bargain to visit his Night Court for one week every month.A Court of Mist and Furywas magical. Angsty. AndDamnably beautiful.Theplotwas so tangible, I didn\'t want to get it over with. Theromancewas so tantalizing, I felt my heart pound frantically in my chest. Theambiencewas soalluring, I struggled to take my eyes off it. And thetwistswere sounexpected, I was forced to gawk and stare at the ceiling, due to relief or stupefaction, I don\'t know. I was thoroughly enchanted in a world filled with intrigue, magic, lies, and secrets and I feel weighed down by the depth of it.Sarah J. Maas\'s writing is the literal definition ofmagnificent.She creates a world so captivating and lets you drown in waves ofwonderand intrigue,enigmaand appeal. Her words are powerful, heavy with conviction, articulate, and relevant. I can\'t thank her enough for delivering this masterpiece and much more. And for introducing me to two of the best characters I can\'t stop fangirling over.Rhysand.High Lord of the Night Court; Beautiful, brutal, and powerful. He appears to be cold and arrogant initially, occasionally cracking jokes about his beauty. He is surrounded by an aura of sensuality and vivacity and he handles even the direst of situations with grace, casually yet courteously. He is as dangerous and ferocious as he is subtle and generous. He hides behind a mask of savagery and manipulation, trickery and deception but beneath the mask, he\'s kind and humble, a High Lord who cares for his people more than he deigns to express.Feyre.Our strong protagonist who develops from being oblivious in the first book to someone who didn\'t need to be coddled, pampered or protected, who didn\'t cravestabilityandcomfort, orluxuryandeasiness. She hates being judged based on her human life. She can be compassionate, affectionate, and loving, but she can also be vicious, seductive, and cunning as she sees fit. Extremely short-tempered and sometimes provocative, she makes for her shortcomings by being powerful, warm, and unbelievably loyal (Ironic, as she keeps calling herself atraitor)I really liked Tamlin inA Court of Thorns and RosesI thought I\'d be devastated by not seeing him with Feyre. But the author made it easy for me to dislike him as he wanted to lock Feyre up, keep her as his trophy and suffocate her by being overprotective.""Love was balm as much as it was poison""The reason why Feyre had been hopelessly in love with Tamlin could\'ve been because of the fact that she was lonely and desired company and so fell for the first person who showed her a hint of kindness and offered commiseration and safety.Whereas Rhysand was different, he gave Feyre the freedom to choose what she desired and believed in her capabilities. He soundlessly, silently, fought for her. A perfect gentleman.""He locked you up because he knew- the bastard knew what treasure you are. That you are worth more than land and jewels.The story also shows us how much our first impression of people/ things could be wrong in the form of role reversals in the male protagonist. Rhysand, who I once perceived as a manipulator, liar, and a ""shameless flirt"" unveils his identity mask and shows how considerate and sacrificing he can be for the people he cares about. I\'m glad I could see a whole new depth to his character, that despite being hard as a shell on the outside, he too had moments of weakness wherein he needed consolation.The book was in support of feminism andequality.It also shows how one can go to any extent to protect their friends and loved ones whilst also exemplifying thatyou can choose your family.Cassian, Azriel, Amren, and Mor were amazing support systems and I\'d give anything to meet them in real life.I could keep going on and on about it, but I think I will peace out for now. 😁✌️'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I don’t even know what to say.

The most prominent one though, the one that glows with the fire of a thousand suns, is how—even as a cheasy, romantic fairytale—this book is more painful and human due to themes of trauma and mental health than both its predecessor and its inspirations:Beauty and the BeastturnedHades and Persephone.“To the stars who listen—and the dreams that are answered.”With anexpanded yet still fairytalish (meaning less defined rules) world,emotional, dramatic, flowing, thread-of-thought writing, andnew, captivating, and steal-your-heart-stab-you-in-the-dark characters and dynamicson top ofthemes of depression, abuse, and post traumatic stress disorder, ACoMaF really has much to talk about.Shall we begin to dig in?“[I knew that] I would never be a gentle grower of things, or someone who burned like fire—but that I would be quiet and enduring and as faceted as the night. That I would have beauty, for those who knew where to look, and if people didn’t bother to look, but to only fear it...then I didn’t particularly care for them, anyway.”Mental Health:How We Can Inflict Pain While in Pain➥PTSD, Depression, and (Possibly) BPD with Feyre & TamlinOne of the first things people criticiseA Court of Mist and Furyfor is Tamlin—some say his actions came out of the blue, while others agree that he was acting according to character but SJM made him an unnecessary villain when he could’ve been given support to heal. So before I discuss Feyre’s mental health issues and their representation, I’m going to address those two groups of people.“I am drowning. And the more you do this...you might as well be shoving my head under the water.”➤Do Tamlin’s choices come out of the blue?The answer is a simple no, and here’s why: Even inA Court of Thorns and Roses,Tamlin was a controling, aggressive, uncommunicative person who did not know how to truly listen or speak, how to be considerate and open. This makes sense because not only was he not taught any of those traits, he also experienced trauma and abuse growing up.He is extremely emotional and has no idea how to control those emotions, all while having learned to ignore his feelings because only ruthlessness equals survival and efficiency. This is unhealthy for a myriad of reasons, least of which is the fact that,no matter how willfully and insistently you turn away from your emotions, they never go away—closing your eyes so you might not see them doesn’t mean they aren’t there, it just means they’ll pounce on you in your greatest moments of weakness and you simply won’t see them coming.“The issue isn’t whether he loved you, it’s how much. Too much. Love can be a poison.”Tamlin is lonely and broken and living behind a wall of mistrust and fear, not knowing how to tear down that wall nor even acknowledging its existence. I have a couple of friends who struggle with Borderline Personality Disorder and, while I don’t want to diagnose anyone here, he actually reminded me of one of them. I will elaborate, bear with me.➤Is Tamlin’s arc unnecessary and unrealistic?That is a straight up no, because of the aforementioned friend. Much like my friend, Tamlin neither wants to acknowledge that he needs help, nor does he want to be vulnerable enough toacceptanyone’s help. Do I think he is broken beyond repair? No, no one is broken beyond repair.Our scars, however ugly, are what make us beautiful, and the cracks in a broken glass can be filled with gold, healed to become something new.But do I think he could’ve healed in this book with the help of Feyre and Lucien? Again no, because of two reasons.“There is the darkness that frightens, the darkness that soothes, the darkness that is restful.” I pictured each. “There is the darkness of lovers, and the darkness of assassins. It becomes what the bearer wishes it to be, needs it to be. It is not wholly bad or good.”❶ I’ve personally grappled with mental illnesses for years and have friends both online and offline suffering who I’ve walked this path with, dragged back from the edge of suicide, and given help and solutions to when they hurt themselves and others so they could heal. I’ve also made a very, very unhealthy choice again and again and put aside my healing to be everyone’s full-time therapist. Anyone who was in pain? I would roll up my sleeves, telling them to come seek me out whenever and for whatever, and put all my energy in the ring when they did.Now, I’ve learned something from my online big sis Cath:You areno one’s therapist(unless that’s your job ofc). And Feyre did what she could to give Tamlin the space and support he needed, but she was also suffering herself and it’s cruel and infuriating to expect her to completely forget about her own pain and force him to heal when he isn’t truly accepting or seeking help. Which is the 2nd reason.“Sweep it under the rug, like everything else.”❷It’s one thing to support and help a friend towards healing, and it’s another thing toheal them. You can’t save a drowning man who refuses to take your hand. You could jump in, grab them, and swim to shore—but there’s a high chance they would drown you, too, in their attempt to get you off them.Again, I have done this, and it’s wrong because not only was I taking away their choice and saying that I know better (which I don’t, it’s their life) I was also risking them drowning me—I don’t much care about this, let me drown who cares, but it’s not healthy behaviour.Still, I’ve done it, put life and breath and soul into showing those drowning friends why they should seek a hand to stop their drowning and learn to swim, and I’ve failed as many times as I’ve succeeded. That friend I mentioned Tamlin reminded me of? She’s one where I failed, and all I could do was watch her in pain as she lashed out and inflicted pain on others, and try my best to do damage control with her victims—because theywerevictims, as Feyre clearly is one.A victim of abuse rooted in ignored, festering pain, twisting a caring, passionate soul into a source of suffering.“There are good days and hard days for me—even now. Don’t let the hard days win.”Now that that is out of the way, how about Feyre’s struggles?➤Above all else, this book is a love letter to healing.I can’t personally vouch for the PTSD (which I found accurately written based on what I’d learned of it from others’ experiences), but I can tell you about depression. And I can tell you how heartwrenchingly Feyre’s suffocating blanket of silence that cruelly embraced her and hauled her beneath the sea resonated with me. I will leave the exploration and healing to Sarah J. Maas. Thank you.Friendship:Why We Need Support to Heal➥Rhys, Mor, Amren, Azriel, and Cass Vs. LucienI think the second best thing about ACoMaF, beside its rep, was its characters and their dynamics. More specifically, the Court of Dreams. I find that name too cheesy to swallow so from now on I’m referring to them as the Gang #sorrynotsorry.“I have so many things to deal with that I’m sometimes tempted to unleash my power across the world and wipe the board clean. Just to buy me some damned peace.”#relatable✦Rhysandmight not be my number one (or two, or even three) character in this series, but that does not mean I don’t love him, it just shows how many amazing characters grace the pages of this book—because Idolove him.He might be arrogant and teasing and always seem in control, but underlying that facade is a deeply rooted insecurity and self doubt.They do say the most seemingly arrogant people in the room are the least confident ones (I mean, I hope they do and I didn’t just creates a saying out of the blue).Confidence means believing in yourself even as you mess up, and Rhys might be arrogant but he’s not confident—his every mistake and misstep are worms he lets devour him from the inside out. And he does make mistakes, because he is not perfect, just as no one is; he is a person who, in his drive to protect and give and give andgivefrom himself until he is bled dry, tends to occasionaly refuse to share what he knows and others should be informed of. What’s most important though is howhe accepts, apologises, and learns from his mistakes because what he values most is freedom of individuals to choose the path they want to walk.“You remain your own person. You decide your fate—your choices. Not me. You chose yesterday. You choose every day. Forever.”✦Amrenwith her no-nonsense, practical, I-will-sooner-kill-you-than-coddle-you attitude is my real number one, because this unyielding Tiny Ancient One would tear the world to pieces to fight for what she holds dear—though you wouldn’t guess what it is she values with her general cutting reply to everything around her.“I once lived in a place where the opinion of others mattered. It suffocated me, nearly broke me. [...] with enough courage, you can say to hell with a reputation. You do what you love, what you need.”✦Mortakes the spot as my 2nd fave right next toAzriel; where one is fire and boldness and charisma, the other is ice and silence and an enigma, and both will have your back and front and sides all the way to the threshold of death—and beyond. And then there is babyCassianwith his insufferable arrogance and heart of marshmallows that will push you and be there to catch you if you fall. (I need to add that I will take my hope for a polyamorous relationship between these three with their complicated, enchanting dynamic to the grave and hold it close through whatever comes next).✦ But why are they so important to Feyre’s healing?Because you can’t heal alone. I’ve tried it, and the road is rockier and more precarious without a shoulder to lean on and a hand to hold.I’m still learning to not cringe at taking a hand to walk the path (and failing, not gonna lie) but I nevertheless appreciate how breathtakingly SJM writes these journeys of recovery every. damn. time. You need friends to heal, and you need to help friends to heal.“I wonder if, even in my despair and hopelessness, I was never truly alone. I wonder if I was looking for this place—looking for you all.”✦ That’s whereLucienfails. I love him and his loyal heart, but sometimes you need to check your loyalty—sometimes the people and values you are holding on to are breaking something rare and fragile.That’s the precise issue with Lucien: He does not understand the depth of Feyre’s pain, if he had, he would’ve fought without backing down, getting up each time he hit the ground, because my baby is not a coward. Alas, people don’t ever really grasp another’s invisible pain.Romance:Where Love Can Bloom(SPOILER ALERT)➥Instalove or Slow Burn, featuring Feysand“I’m thinking, that I look at you and feel like I’m dying. Like I can’t breathe.”Rhysand and Feyre are not my fave couple as their dynamic is too sweet and romantic for me personally. However, it takes nothing away from howyoufeelthem fall in love, like a flower blooming and a freezing pair of hands finding colour next to the miracle of fire, or like the warmth and light of a familiar embrace you fall into in a world of cold, dark unknowns.Some readers accuse the mating bond of being instalove in the case of Rhysand falling for Feyre. Did they read chapter 54? Rhysand fell for her as she was a human surviving Under the Mountain, and everything he did before that was him trying to save an innocent girl he suspected of being his mate but did not specifically feel anything towards.In the end, mayhaps this book is too romantic for me, the aromantic with a heart of ice, to ever be my #1 book of all time, it nonetheless makes a comfortable and cozy den in its corner becauseA Court of Mist and Furyis a fairytale that takes the dashing princes and magic, and replaces it with human suffering and healing.“You think I don’t know how stories get written—how this story will be written? I am the dark lord, who stole away the bride of spring. I am a demon, and a nightmare, and I will meet a bad end. He is the golden prince–the hero who will get to keep you as his reward for not dying of stupidity and arrogance.”CompanionsBook series playlist:Spotify URLBooks in series:➴A Court of Thorns and Roses(ACoTaR, #1) ★★★✯☆➴ A Court of Mist and Fury (ACoTaR, #2) ★★★★★➴A Court of Wings and Ruin(ACoTaR, #3) ★★★★☆➴A Court of Frost and Starlight(ACoTaR, #3.1) ★★★☆☆➴Untitled Novella(ACoTaR, #3.2) ☆☆☆☆☆➴A \u200bCourt of Silver Flames(ACoTaR, #4) ☆☆☆☆☆'}]"

But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband has left her, and her professional life is going nowhere. Regardless of why Evelyn has selected her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.Summoned to Evelyn’s luxurious apartment, Monique listens in fascination as the actress tells her story. From making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the ‘80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way, Evelyn unspools a tale of ruthless ambition, unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love. Monique begins to feel a very real connection to the legendary star, but as Evelyn’s story nears its conclusion, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.","[{'rating': 5, 'content': '5/5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth.

This book is spectacular. This book is outstanding. I have nothing negative to say about this book. It\'s a pure 5 star for me. I\'m irrevocably astonished and astounded.

AFTER THIS LINE I HAD TO FINISH THIS BOOK.And I decided I would finish it. I would read more than 150 pages and finish it. So I went to my obligation the next day with 4 hours of sleep but I was happy about it. Because I knew I couldn\'t survive a whole day without finishing this book. I would die. This is the impact this book has had on me. Now, let\'s talk specifics.Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one in the journalism community is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband, David, has left her, and her career has stagnated. Regardless of why Evelyn has chosen her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.Summoned to Evelyn’s Upper East Side apartment, Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late 80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way. As Evelyn’s life unfolds through the decades—revealing a ruthless ambition, an unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love—Monique begins to feel a very a real connection to the actress. But as Evelyn’s story catches up with the present, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.Historical fiction is my favorite genre of all time. I love it in every form, books, tv shows, movies. But not this kind of historical fiction, theOutlanderandRoss Poldarkkind of historical fiction. The older one, you could say. Also, historical fiction about wars and stuff, which is more recent. But I have never read something about the Old Hollywood. I have only watched movies and tv shows about it. So this was new territory for me.I will admit, it took me about 150 pages to get fully immersed into the story. Up until that point, the book was a 4 star for me. Which is still amazing, but I didn\'t quite understand the hype till that point. A little after Evelyn divulges her secret love, and basically everything starts, my wig is totally snatched. I\'m into the book 100%, ready to knowEVERYTHINGaboutEVERYTHING. The pace was so incredibly fast, there was not a moment I felt my eyes close. The writing was impeccable, some narrations of scenes kept my heart racing. There weren\'t any redundant descriptions of places or rooms, there were descriptions of faces and clothes which kept me enthralled into to the story. The author did an amazing research, it was obvious that she knew her shit, everything was on point. The story kept me on my toes each time with its smart maneuvers, the schemes, the plans, everything the main characters did, all the choices they made, to dodge unfortunate situations. Everything was just... on point. I have nothing bad to say. This never happens. This book was just too perfect. I want to cry because, if not for the hype, I wouldn\'t have picked up this book. And I would have lost such an amazing journey, such an important book. Thank you all for loving this book and making me love it too.Evelyn. Evelyn Hugo is the most flawlessly written character I have ever witnessed. No, wrong. She isn\'t a character to me. She is a person. With influences fromMerilyn MonroeandElizabeth Taylor, the author made Evelyn Hugo her own star. Every time I would read about a scene from one of the movies, I was like ""Oh, I will watch that movie next."", and then I remembered that she doesn\'t actually exist. Which made me sad, because all of the content of this book was so interesting. I felt like I was reading an actual autobiography from a real legendary actress. It was incredible. Evelyn is such a good written character, a good written character, not a good person. She is raw, devious, manipulative, scheming, cold-hearted. She is basically a bitch. But you can\'t help but to want to know everything about her. You want to slap the shit out of her one moment and then hug her the next. She is sensual, enticing, seductive. She always knows what to say to make you believe in her cause. She uses her greatest assets to her benefit, and she isn\'t ashamed about it. She doesn\'t give a fuck. She wants to climb the ladder and she will do anything to achieve her goal. Even marry seven men who will serve her purpose. And she does it. With her scandalous life and her improved acting skills and beneficial movie choices, she climbs to the top. But we also see her sensitive side, her human side. We see her deep friendship with Harry, another remarkable character. We see her love for her child. We see her devotion to Celia. We see her as a human too, with real emotions. And I find that marvelous. I wish all characters in books had so much depth, so much meaning. And not the John Green kind of pretentious deep meaning. The real one.Monique. An underdeveloped character, in my opinion. I didn\'t care that much about her, but her story was gripping. To be honest, Evelyn didn\'t let me care a lot about any other character. She took my attention all to herself. Which is what she did with the entire world. But anyway. An unknown journalist requested to write one of the most popular actresses\' biography. A 35 year old woman, who feels like she hasn\'t achieved much so far in her life. She has a ruined marriage, an under prestigious job, she has been under appreciated all her life, even though she possesses many skills. She is also a POC, and she is mislabeled literally every day. I needed more of her character, I needed to see more of her. But after Evelyn\'s story started, we didn\'t get much of her. But I\'m so happy that she stood up to herself and her self love grew. That Evelyn showed her the way, and she got out of a meaningless marriage, she made deals regarding her job, her future, she stood on her own two feet. I\'m really proud of her.THE REPRESENTATION. THIS BOOK HAD THE BEST REPRESENTATION I HAVE EVER SEEN. Suck it all of you who keep saying a historian fiction can\'t entail good representation.IN YOUR FACES. We have two main interracial characters. One bisexual character, one lesbian character and one gay character. And these are just the main character. We also got side representation, from not as important characters in the story. This factor upped the story so much to me. We got to see the struggles that POV and gay people used to face in a time like this. We got to see our main character hide her true lineage to rise at the top of Hollywood. We got to see two lovers hiding their true sexuality, hiding their undying love for each other because the world would never understand. The conversations between the characters about homophobia of that time period were heartbreaking. I saw so much of our own time in them. So many things have changed since then in our world, and so many have not. We can see the comparisons from these types of books. And it\'s a reminder of how our society is moving forward of backwards. The representation made this book what it is. If every single character was white and straight, I wouldn\'t have been as awed by this book as I am now. And I am myself, a while straight female. Imagine how important representation is for people who can actually relate to it. I would never understand.This book had so many layers. Everything was thought of and processed. Nothing was sloppy, nothing was lacking meaning. Every single word had its reason to be written. I feel privileged to have had the honor of reading this book. It will stick to me for a very long time. I also enjoyed the little snippets we got from the newspapers. They made the setting all the much more real. The relationships were everything, the friendships, the love stories. Evelyn\'s life is so engaging and complicated, you can\'t get enough of it. We truly see how corrupt the Old Hollywood was. And it makes us think about the New Hollywood. Is it still like this? Is everything we see just a fabricated lie? All the lies the characters came up with, seemed to work. I guess, we can never know what happens between closed doors. But I think the New Hollywood is more sincere. It\'s more about talent, at the most part. I\'d like to hope so.In conclusion, I could rave about this book for days. I have so much to say, I could write a book myself. But I\'m gonna end it here. This book was a present sent to me by God himself. I want to read it again and again and again and absorb its wisdom. This book would be such an amazing source material for a movie adaptation.WE NEED THIS TO HAPPEN. But I\'m scared they would ruin it. I\'m always scared with book to movie adaptations. We all readers are. Anyway, I couldn\'t recommend this enough. It doesn\'t matter if you don\'t read historical fiction or adult,PICK THIS BOOK UP. You won\'t regret it one bit. So, till the next one... K BYE!!!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '”Evelyn always leaves you hoping you’ll get just a little bit more. And she always denies you.”This book was so, so, soGOOD!!I swear I was barely two pages in and already knew that I’d love it with all my heart! <3 There’s just something about that golden Hollywood era that captivated me right from the beginning and once Evelyn entered the scene I was a goner. I just loved the way her story was told!We didn’t only get the interviews with Monique but also were able to read news articles about her life and this made everything so much more intriguing. I mean “Hollywood Digest”, “Sub Rosa” or the “New York Tribune”, they all wrote about Evelyn’s life and those articles give an authenticity that makes this book feel real. It could have happened, Evelyn could have been a real Hollywood Star and people could have been as fascinated by her as by Marilyn Monroe or Marlene Dietrich.I think to some degree Taylor Jenkins Reid might have even had Marilyn Monroe in her mind when she wrote Evelyn’s character and knowing how awesome Marilyn was this really doesn’t come as a surprise. XD Another thing I appreciated was that every husband got a part of this book and even though there were seven of them, who all influenced Evelyn and left a mark on her character, none of them actually was her one true love. It’s a very particular approach to a great story and I loved the way it was carried out.Still, after I read the ending my mind was reeling and my feelings were so mixed that I had a tough time coming to terms with everything that was revealed. There were so many things I felt conflicted about and even now, after more than a week has passed, I still didn’t manage to sort out my feelings and I still don’t know what to do with them. Maybe I’ll have to get used to the idea that to think about Evelyn Hugo and her seven husbands will always make me feel conflicted and that there’s no such thing as making peace with an ending like that.And maybe, just maybe, that was Taylor Jenkins Reid’s plan all along. ;-)The characters:Welcome to my characters section, aka “The spoilery spoiler zone”! If you didn’t read the book yet and still want to be surprised by its revelations you better don’t continue to read my review. I’m worse than any tabloid mentioned in this book and I’ll spoil you relentlessly! If you still want to read my gossip, go ahead, but don’t say I didn’t warn you! ;-PEvelyn Hugo:”And I didn’t say I was confessing any sins. To say that what I have to tell is a sin is misleading and hurtful. I don’t feel regret for the things I’ve done – at least, not the things you might expect – despite how hard they may have been or how repugnant they may seem in the cold light of day.”Oh, Evelyn! Where do I even begin? I loved that woman so damn much, I can’t even! <333 It’s so rare to meet such a complex character in a book but damn Evelyn just had it all! She was neither white nor black, and if anything she was all different shades of grey. I loved that she was so ruthless, that she did what she had to do in order to get what she wanted, that she was unapologetic about her decisions and behaviour and that she never held back and just wanted it all! Celia was right, at times Evelyn could be really awful and egoistic, but damn did her good qualities make up for it. Compassionate, caring and protective of the ones she loved she would have done everything possible to keep them safe and happy. Gosh,WHAT. A. WOMAN!I think I might be in love with her! <333”Did I want to make as much money as Don? Of course I did. I wanted to get the paycheck and mail a copy of it to him with a photo of my middle finger. But mostly I wanted the freedom to do whatever I wanted.””I told her every single day that her life had been the world’s greatest gift to me, that I believed I was put on earth not to make movies or wear emerald-green gowns and wave at crowds but to be her mother.””I regret every second I didn’t spend with her. I regret every stupid thing I did that caused her an ounce of pain. I should have chased her down the street the day she left me. I should have begged her to stay. I should have apologized and sent roses and stood on top of the Hollywood sign and shouted, ‘I’m in love with Celia St. James!’ and let them crucify me for it.”Celia St. James:”I really like you. I like watching you on-screen. I like how the moment you show up in a scene, I can’t look at anything else. I like the way your skin is too dark for your blond hair, the way the two shouldn’t go together and yet seem so natural on you. And to be honest, I like how calculating and awful you kind of are.”Now here’s the thing, I know that Celia was the love of Evelyn’s life and I could see that they loved each other deeply, but – and here comes the hugeBUT– I had the feeling that I could never truly connect to her. I don’t know what it was that kept me from adoring her the way I adore Evelyn but I think it might have been the sum of thousands of little things that ultimately left a bad taste in my mouth. For instance I hated that Evelyn always seemed to feel like she had done something wrong and that it was her responsibility to set things right again. I mean Celia threw a lot of awful things at her too, but in the end it always seemed to be Evelyn that blamed herself for it. Also I didn’t like that Celia wasn’t only self-righteous but also more than just a little judgemental. You’d think a person who represents the “L” in LGBTQ+ would be more accepting and open-minded when her partner is bi, but nope Celia was almost as bi-phobic as the men in Evelyn’s life and that made me really sad. =(”That was how it was with Celia. When you denied her what she wanted, when you hurt her, she made sure you hurt, too.””So I told myself that the spark between Celia and me was just a quirk we had. Which was convincing as long as it remained quirky.Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.”Harry Cameron:”I want to be with someone I love. I want to have a companion. I’d like to bring someone home to my family. I don’t want to live alone anymore. And I want a son or a daughter. We could have that together. I can’t give you everything. I know that. But I want to raise a family, and I’d love to raise one with you.”Aside from Evelyn, Harry Cameron wastruly the best thingabout this entire book! <33 I loved this man so much and I think he’s an angel! He was always respectful and supportive and even more important he accepted Evelyn exactly the way she was. I loved that he and Evelyn always tried to solve every problem together and I hated to see him so sad after the death of John. T_T Harry’s grief broke my heart and even though he was drinking way too much he never did anything stupid. I mean he never hurt Evelyn or got frustrated with her, he only tried to compensate his grief without hurting anyone else in the process. Even when it came to this he was considerate and kind. =(( Poor Harry, though. It made me so damn sad that he had to go and I admit it, I actually shed some tears when he died. T_TMonique Grant:”Why, until this moment, did I not realize that the issue is my own confidence? That the root of most of my problems is that I need to be secure enough in who I am to tell anyone who doesn’t like it to go fuck themselves? Why have I spent so long settling for less when I know damn well the world expects more?”To say their relationship was complicated would be putting it more than just mildly! It was really interesting to see Monique’s character arc though. I mean at the beginning she was a shy mouse that didn’t dare to say anything to her boss and by the end of the book she was a young successful woman who stood up for herself and finally had the guts to make decisions she never even dared to consider. I think that to get to know Evelyn and to find out the truth behind her father’s death was necessary to find her happiness and I’m convinced that both of those things were able to give her some closure. I could understand her anger towards Evelyn, her hurt when she found out what she had done and the inability to truly hate her for it. Because she got to know the person behind the movie star and she knew how broken Evelyn was on the inside, how much pain she had suffered, how much loss she had endured. =( Still, that scene when she pondered whether to get on the train or not, the thoughts that crossed her mind, her inner struggle how to deal with the situation at hand. Damn, this was one of the best book moments I ever had the pleasure to read. Well done, Taylor Jenkins Reid, well done! I had goose bumps following that inner conflict. *shudders*”I’m Evelyn.” She reaches out and takes my hand, shaking it. It strikes me as a unique form of power to say your own name when you know that everyone in the room, everyone in the world, already knows it.””I insist that you be ruthless in your negotiating, Monique. Make them pay you what they would pay a white man. And then, once you’ve done that, every penny from it will be yours.”The relationships & ships:Evelyn & Celia:”I wanted to give her a lot of things. I wanted what I had to be hers. I wondered if this was what it felt like to love someone.”Those two were the death of me, I swear! Their ups and downs, their struggles and fights, their love and dreams, their hopes and shattered realities. ARGH! It was so obvious they loved each other, yet they could never be together. Because the world didn’t let them and wouldn’t have understood, because they didn’t want the same thing, because they weren’t ready to be in a relationship and unable to make arrangements. Because… justBECAUSE!There was always another reason why they couldn’t be happy, another misunderstanding that tore at their foundations, another bump on the road that caused them to drift apart. They loved and lost and loved and lost again. It was so heart-breaking to watch! And Celia, she killed me. With everything she said to Evelyn! I knew she loved her, yet she hurt her so much! >_< I just wished she would have had more sympathy for Evelyn’s outlook and I really wish she would have tried to understand Evelyn’s sexuality. So many of their problems could have been solved, they could have gained so many years if they just would have allowed themselves to be who they are. Their love was so tragic… more tragic than any of the movies they produced over the years. And it really made me sad. T_T”Evelyn, who was your great love? You can tell me.”Evelyn looks out the window, breathes in deeply, and then says, “Celia St. James.”The room is quiet as Evelyn lets herself hear her own words. And then she smiles, a bright, wide, deeply sincere smile. She starts laughing to herself and then refocuses on me. “I feel like I spent my entire life loving her.””It’s not wrong,” Celia said. “It shouldn’t be wrong, to love you. How can it be wrong?”“It’s not wrong, sweetheart. It’s not,” I said. “They’re wrong.””If you love someone enough, you should be able to overcome anything,” she said. “And we have always loved each other so much, more than I ever thought I could be loved, more than I ever thought I could love. So why … why couldn’t we overcome it?”“We did,” I said, turning towards her. “We’re here.”She shook her head. “But the years,” she said.”There’s a difference between sexuality and sex. I used sex to get what I wanted. Sex is just an act. Sexuality is a sincere expression of desire and pleasure. That I always kept for Celia.”Evelyn & Harry:”You do not know how fast you have been running, how hard you have been working, how truly exhausted you are, until someone stands behind you and says, “It’s OK, you can fall down now. I’ll catch you.”So I fell down.And Harry caught me.Their friendship was everything, absolutelyE.V.E.R.Y.T.H.I.N.G.!!!Gosh, I loved their relationship so much, I can’t even!!! They were so perfect together and understood each other better than anyone else. They were so close it sometimes felt like they could read each other’s mind and I think of all the husbands Evelyn married over the years, Harry definitely was the best! <333 (Of course her last hubby was awesome too but if you ask me no one was able to hold a candle to Harry!) I know Harry was gay and had no sexual desire for women and I know that Evelyn loved Celia but damn those two made so much sense! They shared a love that is sometimes even harder to find than the once in a lifetime love we all crave for and they were so much more than just friends. They were business partners, equals, best friends, partners in crime, confidants, soul mates and kindred spirits. And most importantly, they loved each other deeply! <333 It’s so rare to find a friend like that, so rare to have a connection like that, to be loved liked that… ARGH! I justLOVEDthem!!! This was such a wholesome representation of a deep friendship and I’m incapable to put it into words. *breaks down and sobs*”I promise I’ll do whatever I can. I promise you we will figure this out.”“OK,” Harry said, and then he squeezed my hand back and walked out the door. “We will figure this out.””I want you to stay, Harry. We need you. Me and Connor.” I grabbed his hand tighter. “But if you have to go, then go. Go if it hurts. Go if it’s time. Just go knowing you were loved, that I will never forget you, that you will live in everything Connor and I do. Go knowing I love you purely, Harry, that you were an amazing father. Go knowing I told you all my secrets. Because you were my best friend.”The bi rep:”It really makes you think, doesn’t it? That people were so eager to believe we were swapping spouses but would have been scandalized to know we were monogamous and queer?”And now we finally come to one of the most important subjects of this book: The bi rep! And let me tell you, it was spot-on! Evelyn is a bi icon and for the rest of my life I’ll never get tired of emphasizing how important this kind of representation is! Throughout the entire book Evelyn is confronted with bi-phobia but she always took it in stride! She accepted herself the way she was and she did an amazing job at trying to explain her sexuality. I know some of you might say that it shouldn’t even be necessary to explain your sexuality to others and I’m inclined to agree, but the bitter truth is that we have to explain it no matter if we want to or not. I can only speak from personal experience here but usually straight people have a hard time understanding how you can love both sexes equally and make no difference, while lesbian or gay people might just try to label you as one of their own. What Celia did?! It happens! It happens way too often and even though her actions and behaviour left a bitter taste in my mouth it still represented one of the many facets of reality. I loved the way Taylor Jenkins Reid gave Evelyn a voice though. Evelyn Hugo didn’t accept those prejudices, nope, she gave us her honest opinion, her point of view and made the other characters acknowledge her for who she was! And this was wholesome and healthy and might help a lot of people to accept themselves! So thank you Taylor Jenkins Reid! Thank you very much! <333”Being bisexual didn’t make me disloyal,” Evelyn says. “One has nothing to do with the other. Nor did it mean that Celia could only fulfil half my needs.””I hated being called a lesbian. Not because I thought there was anything wrong with loving a woman, mind you. No, I’d come to terms with that a long time ago. But Celia only saw things in black and white. She liked women and only women. And I liked her. And so she often denied the rest of me.””Wow,” he said. “Incredible. I married a dyke.”“Stop saying that,” I said.“Evelyn, if you have sex with women, you are a lesbian. Don’t be a self-hating lesbian. That’s not… that’s not becoming.”My conclusion:The more I think about this book, the more I love it! This is such an important read! I know Reid tackled a lot of problematic topics in this book, but she did it in such a positive and sensible way that I’m convinced everyone who reads“The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo”will learn something good from it! I’m usually not the kind of person who throws a book at you and says you should read it but in all seriousness: Read this one! Live and suffer with Evelyn, enjoy her good moments and cry with her when the world throws her for a loop! Hate her, love her, accept her the way she is. And most importantly, learn from her mistakes and don’t hesitate to show the world your true self. ;-)I know this review has been already way too long but I still want to thank the ever charmingAshleyfor this wonderful buddy read! We both didn’t have it easy while reading this book together, but we always managed to find a compromise and were able to continue once our lives started to become a little less hectic. *lol* I’m glad we could read this together and I hope sooner or later we’ll find another book to buddy read again! =)'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '➸4.5 stars➷ the seven husbands of evelyn hugo by taylor jenkins reid is a captivating novel that delves into the glamorous and tumultuous life of the enigmatic hollywood icon, evelyn hugo. the story is narrated by monique grant, a young journalist who is given the exclusive opportunity to interview evelyn hugo, now in her late seventies, about her legendary career and her seven marriages and tumultuous relationships that shaped her career and personal life. as monique delves deeper into evelyn’s story, she uncovers shocking revelations that force her to confront her own past and identity.— this book honestly surpassed my expectations. i’m always a bit iffy about reading popular books, but i absolutely loved this story! i honestly did not expect it to make me cry so much, seriously this book had no right ripping my heart out into tiny little pieces. i don’t even think this was supposed to be an emotional read but my heart just broke for these characters and how they weren’t allowed to love whoever they wanted. i grew so attached to these characters and parting ways with them was such a tragedy to me lmaoo. evelyn, celia, harry and john are truly my little family. i should’ve closed the book after the picnic scene and just pretended that they all lived happily ever after 😭💔tjr’s writing style is just mesmerising. she has this incredible ability for drawing you into her stories with such vivid detail that you feel like you’re right there in the moment, experiencing everything alongside her characters. this story transports us back into old hollywood and it makes me feel like i’m immersed into the glitz and glamour of the ‘50s and ‘60s silver screen.psa: mick riva needs his own tw. i’m so tired of having to see that deadbeat’s name!! he is a jump scare at this point.➳evelyn hugo:“i’m bisexual, don’t ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box.”she’s an icon, she’s a legend and she is the moment. she’s so effortlessly glamorous, she’s brilliant and powerful but that doesn’t mean she is a good person — but she’s not an unlikeable character. i understand all the decisions and sacrifices she had to make to get to where she is in life. she done some horrible things, but she would NEVER take them back because she only wanted to protect the people she loved the most. she is a flawed character, she’s ruthless, selfish, manipulative and she is unapologetic about her life choices and wasn’t afraid to use her body to get important roles. evelyn always has to get her own way but that made me love her even more and what gave her so much depth. she lived her life the best way she could. she had a dream she was determined to fulfil and she knew what she had to do to make her dream a reality.➳celia st. james:“all i’ve ever wanted was for you to be truly mine. but you’ve never been mine. not really. i’ve always had to settle for one piece of you. while the world gets the other half. i don’t blame you. it doesn’t make me stop loving you. but i can’t do it. i can’t do it, evelyn.”SCREAMING, CRYING, THROWING UP!! I WILL KEEP SAYING IT, THEY DESERVED MORE TIME TOGETHER!! TJR YOU ARE A SICK WOMAN, YOU WILL BE HEARING FROM MY THERAPIST 😭😭oh celia, the love of evelyn’s life. she’s another complicated character but i actually loved her, she’s the complete opposite to evelyn. she embodies kindness and compassion in her own right. while evelyn was portrayed as confident and assertive, celia’s demeanour was more reserved and gentle. she could be mean-spirited towards evelyn, i get she always done it out of hurt and jealousy but she had to understand that evelyn went to great lengths to protect their relationship from ever being exposed. but celia loved and cared for evelyn so deeply. tjr perfectly captured celia’s selfishness and her closeted struggles, as well as her complicated feelings with having to share evelyn with others. i would do ANYTHING for celia’s pov especially during the time when they didn’t talk for 5 years 😖➳harry cameron:“it’s ok, you can fall down now. i’ll catch you.” so i fell down. and harry caught me.the friendship between evelyn and harry is truly so special. they are the epitome of ‘platonic soulmates.’ he was present for the majority of evelyn’s life. their friendship is built on a foundation of mutual respect and understanding. they will always have each others back no matter the circumstances. my heart broke with him when he lost john because he ended up losing himself that day too. i loved his relationship with his daughter, she was truly the light of his life and what kept him going. he deserved the world and he deserved so much better. we all deserve a harry cameron in our life <33➳monique grant:as evelyn’s chosen confidante, monique finds herself drawn into a world of glamour and intrigue far removed from her own humble existence. tasked with penning evelyn’s long-awaited memoir, monique is granted unparalleled access to the inner workings of evelyn’s mind and heart, a privilege that comes with its own set of challenges and responsibilities. but i’m going to be straight up and say that her character honestly has no importance to me whatsoever. as a secondary character she was overshadowed by evelyn’s life and her character lacked so much depth. the reveal of the significant plot connection to evelyn later on left me feeling underwhelmed due to the lack of emphasis on monique and her story throughout the book.꒰evelyn + celia:꒱“i spent half my time loving her and the other half hiding how much i loved her.”i am a evelyncelia defender for life!! if they have no fans, i am dead. their love story is absolutely heartbreaking. their connection is electric, their moments together is filled with so much raw emotion and undeniable chemistry. yet as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that they are star-crossed lovers, bound by societal expectations and personal sacrifices. yes it seemed complex but at times their relationship was toxic. the ache for more time together is palpable — i’m so mad bc i wish they had so much more time together, to bask in their love without the constraints of society or circumstance. they were robbed of many precious moments and they lost so many years. every stolen moment between them is filled with longing and passion, it constantly had me yearning for more. yet amidst all the heartache, their love for one another shines so brightly. they are truly the epitome of soulmates. their relationship was so heart wrenching because they truly deserved so much better. they deserved to love each other freely and unabashedly!! ❤️\u200d🩹— overall, this book is a masterful tapestry of love, ambition, and the search for identity set against the dazzling backdrop of old hollywood. tjr’s exquisite prose and nuanced characters invite readers on an unforgettable journey, challenging them to reflect on the true cost of fame and the enduring power of authenticity. with its gripping narrative and rich historical detail, this novel transcends its genre, leaving a lasting impression on all who have the pleasure of delving into evelyn hugo’s captivating world. this story made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me angry but i adored this book and these character with my whole heart. i can’t wait for the netflix adaption, my heart is going to be broken all over again and i’m so ready for it lmaoo.───♡─────────────why did this book have me crying like a lil bitch 😭 i am evelyn hugo’s #1 defender until the day i die!! rtc—this slump is eating me alive!!! also the fact i still haven’t read this book is criminal. in tjr we trust 😩'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""This review contains a spoiler for a reveal around 100 pages into the novel. I knew this reveal going in and do not believe knowing this reveal hurts the reading experience.I think a lot about the idea of love as something dangerous, as something that you have to fight for. And it's only recently that I've decided that's something that probably has to do with loving women. I have been very lucky, in growing up in liberal California and in the 2000s. But I received marriage rights in my country four months after realizing I liked girls, and in reading about the past and thinking about the past, I am constantly, daily, reminded how being born ten years earlier would have made everything that much more dangerous, that much more violent, that much more fearful.And there is something so woefully romantic to me about the fact that there were people who braved that climate and loved anyway and paved the path, while doing so, for me and so many others.So that's all to say that this book made me experience all five stages of grief and simultaneously made me feel every positive emotion in the world and I have no idea how that is possible. but listen, if you only read one book I recommend you this year, I want it to be this one.“Make them pay you as much as they would a white man.”The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugois, yeah, about the seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo. Seven husbands who are sometimes awful and sometimes sympathetic and sometimes somewhere in between. Ernie, who she used to get to where she is, Don, who beat her till she barely knew whether to continue, Harry, who she loved more than any of them, Max, who loves the idea of her more than he could ever love her.But I think, despite its marketing, this book is really about Evelyn.Awful, complicated, completely lovable Evelyn. Evelyn is a flawed, compelling, brave, ambitious woman who got to where she was with teeth and claws and never gave up. She is also, and I’m not even joking, one of the most iconic characters I have ever had the pleasure of reading about. She is a woman with a lot of ambition but also one who loves and wants to be loved. She issucha good character.This book is also fiercely and unapologetically socio-political and Ilovethat. Evelyn’s story is one of being a woman in a man’s world. It is one of being a Cuban woman in a white woman’s world. It is one of being a bisexual woman in an era where attraction to women was demonized by the whole culture. It is one of hiding yourself for ambition, one of trying to decide which one takes precedent, one of aging, and one of never knowing whether your choices wereright.Annnnnnnd this book also has the most fucking heartbreaking romantic relationship I have had the displeasure to read about in my entire life. I don’t… I don’t know if romantic relationships should be considered spoilers, but… well, I knew going in who the actual love of Evelyn’s life was and it STILL WORKED FOR ME. So here it is: Evelyn Hugo and Celia St. James are one of my favorite fictional relationships, of all time, ever. These two have a complicated, flawed, at times tumultous relationship, and yet they love each other so much, always.“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.”And perhaps my favorite part was the messaging around the importance of actual love in relationships, rather than just a willingness to try.“You didn't come here and tell me how much you miss me. Or how hard it has been to live without me. You said you didn't want to give up. And I don't want to give up, either. I don't want to fail at this. But that's not actually a great reason to stay together. We should have reasonswhywe don't want to give. It shouldn't just bethatwe don't want to give up.

Divorce is a piece of paper.Evelyn Hugo was the star of the century.She dominated the big screen for more than four decades. Every man wanted her and every woman wanted to be her.Perhaps most famously, Evelyn Hugo wasmarried seven times.Each divorce only increased her fame.Rumors swept through the tabloids like wildfire.I’m under absolutely no obligation to make sense to you.And now, age 79, Evelyn Hugo decided to auction off her mostwildly famous gownsand offered one lucky journalist (Monique) an interview that will last a lifetime.However, Monique soon learns that this is beyond a two-page spread. Evelyn Hugo is offering a tell-all - a full biography - that promises to be the mostscandalous and salaciousthing that has ever graced this world.Monique would be a fool - an absolute fool - to pass this up. But the thought, the 'it's too good to be true' sort of thought, continues to replay in her mind.Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.Overall, this one was good but I was never wowed.Everyone and their mother was talking up this book and while I agree that it is engaging and scandalous (in a good way)...I don't know.I just expected more from it.I definitely think it was well-written...just a bit dull in areas.We start the book with 40 pages of just talking up Evelyn Hugo and it really did drag. There's only so many times I can hear about howwonderful and stunninga person is before it gets boring.I think if more of the marriages were teased in the beginning - just to give the audience a taste of the mystery surrounding her love life (rather than going on and on about how intriguing it was...without telling us what was intriguing about it) would have helped significantly.Once we got to her life, the book certainly picked up.I really lovedhow Evelyn's sexuality was portrayedin this book. I liked watching her grow as a person - from a teenager using sex to get herself out of a hellhole to falling in love and finding it something to be cherished.Her love forCeliathroughout the years truly made thiswildly unbelievable story cinchfor me. Honestly,her relationship with CeliaTheir love was expertly done, with all of the fear and paranoia associated with the times, that it truly felt like real life.Ultimately, this was an enjoyable read, a bit slow paced, but enjoyable nonetheless!Never let anyone make you feel ordinary.YouTube|Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Facebook| Snapchat @miranda_reads""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""WOW I NEVER POSTED THIS. What a pleasant surprise! After dozens of unposted-unwritten reviews, finally an unposted-but-written one. Life is beautiful.But first off (I can call this first off if I freaking want to!!!) I wanna say: DON’T LET ANYONE TELL YOU THAT HISTORICAL FICTION CAN’T BE DIVERSE. Tell that anthropomorphized tennis ball they’re either uncreative or a secret bigot or a full-on dunce or ALL THREE. Because this book pulls it off with more than a tablespoon of grace, I’ll tell you that.My guy, there aren’t even that many characters in this book. And we’re following the majority of them starting in the 1950s. Not exactly, y’know, the peak of support for diversity in America. AND STILL WE DON’T LACK FOR REPRESENTATION. Do you get how great that is? I’m ready to punch the whitesplainers of Disney’s Frozen in their boring pale faces. The word “Frozen” is actually a reference to the lack of movement in the creativity centers of their brains. (Follow for more behind the scenes Disney-Pixar facts.)This book includes three (three!) interracial relationships. Actually, it’s more like ten if you count the fact that our protagonist is Latina. Yes! This may be the bare minimum, but I’m so used to YA wherein one pale as snow teen romances a - gasp - pale aspaperteen! Diversity in young adult books = one character is of Western European descent and the other Eastern European. Talk about a vanilla romance. (Buh dum ch.)This book proves how important it is to provide diversity. The difference in the believability and intricacy of the story is incredible.I will say we don’t often get a good look at the variance in culture that comes with diversity here. Evelyn Hugo, though the daughter of Cuban immigrants, purposefully represses her heritage in order to fit in with the whitewashed 1950s and ’60s cinema scene. Our narrator, though half-black, expresses a fear that someone will tell her she’s “not black enough.” I wish the ethnic diversity played a little more into the text, but it didn’t feel unrealistic or anything. The reasoning was explained.But there’s even more diversity. Like, it gets even better. Because, again, despite the time setting, this book contains A SH*T TON of LGBT+ rep. And these are some of the most beautifully portrayed LGBT+ relationships I’ve ever read. If you don’t read this book for anything else, read it for that fine-ass inclusion, boi.Beyond that, this is the ultimate guilty pleasure book. IT IS SO FUN READING ABOUT OLD HOLLYWOOD AND OLD MOVIES. I wanted to watch the entire Evelyn Hugo canon after this, and then it was like, oh wait, she’s not real.I don’t have much else to say. This is chick-lit-y historical fiction at its finest. It’s just so fun. Some people say they got bored halfway through, and I get why you could, but I didn’t. I really fell in love with the world of this book, and the depiction of Old Hollywood, and all that jazz.A lot is revealed over the course of the book, and the best part is just being surprised at each twist and turn, so I don’t want to go to specifics even a little. I’m just going to cut off this review here before I risk, like, accidentally mentioning that Evelyn Hugo’s third husband turned her into a vampire and she was a vampire the whole time and she turns Monique at the end of the book.*Damn it!Bottom line: This is very fun and cool and maybe even important. Read it!!!*This isn’t true, by the way. Duh.----------------------rereading updateswas tempted to spend my whole day watching old movies and not reading at all.compromised by rereading this instead.this was a very good plan.----------------------pre-reviewThis book? It's really great.I got a hell of a lot more than I bargained for.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""This right here. This is why I read. For the joy and privilege of coming across an exquisite story like this and being swept up in its magic.CouldThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugoreally be fiction, dreamt up entirely in Taylor Jenkins Reid's mind? Every moment felt so real, so tangible. When I reached the end, it was hard to let go, hard to return to a world where this was nothing more than a figment of the imagination.Evelyn Hugo, revered Hollywood actress and icon, is finally ready to tell the story of her life. But she wants to make sure that whatever comes out is authentic to who she is. So she contacts Monique Grant, a mostly unknown writer, to be her scribe. Everyone is surprised by the choice, no one more so than Monique herself. But to be given the chance to write Evelyn's memoir and to understand the person behind the legend is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, one that Monique can't pass up.When I first started this, I thought I was in for a fluffy, gossipy romance set in the golden Hollywood era. After all, why would anyone need so many husbands unless one was in it for a good time? But this turned out to be so much more. At its heart, it's a stunning and brutally honest portrayal of love in all its different forms. It shows not just the joy of love, but also its sacrifices and heartbreaks.I was blown away by how complex of a character Evelyn Hugo is. She is the heart and soul of this story, and her character shines so bright, it's hard to look away. She feels real, coming off the pages wholly formed. She's not perfect. In fact, her flaws and numerous questionable actions make her human, and it's easy to relate to her and cheer for her.The book is written in alternative viewpoints, a little bit from Monique's perspective as she interviews Evelyn and a lot from Evelyn's perspective as she shares the story of her life. When a book has two different viewpoints, there's always a fear that one is more interesting than the other. But not here. I can honestly say that every moment of this book was equally riveting.I adored Reid's writing style. It's filled with so much charm that it just oozes off the pages. The story obviously tackles serious issues, but the writing never takes itself too seriously. It's witty and funny, drawing me in and making me feel every emotion. It manages to convey so much nuance without ever slowing down the pacing or seeming long-winded. I'm in awe.You guys know I'm a romantic through and through. And this story is all about finding and holding on to that great love of your life, no matter what it takes. I mean, how could I not be drawn to that? I'm also a realist and I know that love takes so much sacrifice. So this story spoke to my heart and my mind.I never really had a chance. This book had me good and hooked, right from the first page. It's the sort of story I know I'll come back to again and again, savoring it anew every time.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:Carrie Soto Is BackDaisy Jones & The SixMalibu Rising~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

It's not the kind of thing I usually pick up, and I haven't read anything by Reid before. But something about it intrigued me. So I checked out the kindle sample. Just a couple chapters, I figured, because I probably wouldn't like it anyway.And I was HOOKED.It's perfect, easy beach read material. It's not particularly deep, it does not take the genre to new levels or make you think about something new, and yet it DID feel different. Evelyn Hugo's story was sodelicious and compellingthat it stood out, and kept me turning pages in a desperate need to discover the stories behind her seven husbands, and the answer to the one question everyone wants to know: who was her greatest love?The framing of the story reminded me a lot ofThe Thirteenth Tale. Like that book, inThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, a young woman - this time an ambitious journalist called Monique Grant - goes to interview an elderly woman. UnlikeThe Thirteenth Tale, this elderly woman happens to be one of the most famous actresses in the world.Evelyn Hugo has lived a life in the public eye, but she is full of secrets. Only she knows what happened behind the scenes in her long career of scandals and highly-publicized heartbreaks. Just like the fictional world of the book longed to know the truth-- so did I. Reid and Evelyn's habit of giving you just enough to leave you wanting more was incredibly exciting. Throughout, we are encouraged to wonder why someone like Evelyn Hugo would specifically request a relatively-inexperienced journalist like Monique. Why Monique? What is Evelyn hiding?The more I got to know Evelyn, the more I fell in love with her. She has made a lot of controversial decisions during her career, but she knows it and she also knows she'd probably do it all again. She's played the Hollywood game, dated famous men to further her career, and used her body to get what she wants. She has experienced the full force of the industry's sexism and, in some ways, capitalized on it. She is deeply flawed and aware of it. She has traded important aspects of her identity for more fame, more roles, more money. She was a badass Cuban woman working in an industry that didn't like women to be badass or Cuban. She manipulated and she lied.Despite everything - and because of it - I liked her.I stayed fully engrossed in the story of Evelyn Hugo - and of Monique Grant - from the opening chapters when Evelyn demanded an interview with only Monique, through decades of Hollywood in all its shimmering ugliness, right until the ending's final reveals.I enjoyed every moment.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Best rereading choice for flashback Saturday is re-devouring my all time favorite TJR book!Evelyn Hugo a. k. a. Evelyn Elena Herrera is one of the most portrayed characters, a daughter of Cuban immigrants, raised in poverty. She’s not only beautiful, alluring but there’s something different about her: her energy is vivid, radiating. She knows what she wants for her life and she’s competitive and determined enough how she may get it by leaving her life in Hell’s Kitchen and moving to Los Angeles to become one of the movie stars, dying her hair, exposing her slender body, looking directly at the camera with her almond shaped eyes under her long lashes till the director tells her “cut”.Now she’s 79, married SEVEN TIMES, a Hollywood legend, ready to share her life story and scandalous secret she kept for years. She befriends 35 years old Monique Grant, an unknown reporter works for “Vivant” in Los Angeles. Even the boss of Monique has no clue why this Hollywood legend demanded to work with her: she could choose someone more experienced, popular, known in the industry.So many question balloons start to fly above our heads:- Why Evelyn wants to talk only Monique and if she doesn’t, the memoir deal will be off?- Why Evelyn married seven times. Did she love any of her husbands? Does she have resentments? Does she suffer from heartbreak? Which one of is the love of her life?-As soon as their interview starts, Evelyn takes her an adventurous train ride with full of juicy, entertaining, heartbreaking, emotional stories starting from glamorous 60’s of La La Land, the productions of her famous movies, how her path crossed with those men, how she saved them and they saved her, how she got hurt, how she shone, how she burned… and eventually a big secret reveals about her life story which will change everything about true identity of Evelyn and the life choices she’s made!It’s brilliant!

It is a favorite of the year, it will be a favorite of all time. I am wholly enchanted byThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugoand I will never forget how much I adore this book.CW: domestic abuse, death/grief, homophobia/biphobia, racismabortion & suicideAdult fiction is not typically my cup of tea, especially a combination of historical fiction and contemporary with the amount of long flashbacks (flashbacks: ALSO NOT MY THING). I have no idea how this combination of literary elements I typically do not like consumed my entire being, but it did. Taylor Jenkins Reid is an immensely talented author. Her prose is beautiful, vivid, and descriptive. There isn’t a moment throughout this story where I was bored or underwhelmed. Every second of this book is completely engaging – it was a huge struggle to put the book down.Evelyn Hugo is one of the greatest literary characters I have ever had the pleasure to read from. The exploration of her Cuban heritage and bisexuality is fascinating, especially given the era and her celebrity status. She is one of those intoxicating characters you will never be able to purge from your mind with her strong will, her independence, her strength, her cunning, and her compassion. Evelyn Hugo is unforgettable in my mind and hearing her story was one of the greatest pleasures I think I have ever experienced as a reader.Personally, I didn’t LOVE Monique, though I am always happy to see another biracial main character in literature. I appreciated her contribution to the story as I feel the book would lose some of it’s strength if there was not another character for Evelyn to explain her actions and motivations to and it was just her story, but it’s for that reason that I sometimes felt she was more of a plot device than an individual character. Compared to Evelyn, I just did not care for Monique’s individual life and problems. I enjoyed seeing how Evelyn influenced her life, but her storyline was so drab compared to Evelyn. Edit 4/3/2019 - After a second read, I GREATLY appreciate Monique. Her character is so nuanced and necessary to the story. I totally relinquish much of my initial feelings on her.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugois one of my favorite books OF ALL TIME.

Evelyn starts to reveal her story to Monique, that life isn\'t perfect, that people are more than just one thing, that relationships are complicated, the power of forgiveness and reinvention, the idea of family, loss, and accepting the choices of others.This book had such depth and tackled so many issues. One of them was the concept of divorce. Growing up in a Baptist church, divorce was viewed as the ultimate sin. As soon as anyone heard that someone was divorced, they had a permanent scarlet letter attached to them. However, as I matured, life isn\'t nearly as black and white. Do you really know what happened? Did the man beat this woman and then run off with all of the money, just to teach her a lesson? Why does society still think it is OK to stigmatize divorced people?There were a tremendous amounts of very quotable quotes, and this was one of those rare books that you hope never has to end.""There are people who see a beautiful flower and rush over to pick it.""This book also tackled some of the issues that women face. ""Oh, I know the whole world prefers a woman who doesn\'t know her power, but I\'m sick of all that.""

It reminded me of the family sagas of the yore, kind of likeThe Thorn Birds. Only this book needed another 300 pages to dig deeper into the dramas of Evelyn's life and her psyche. I was entertained by the events of Hugo's Hollywood adventures, but ultimately this book lacks depth. Nobody else noticed how superficial everything is in this novel - relationships, emotions, portrayals of race and queerness?The novel is framed as a biography written by a talented up-and-coming jornalist, but reads as if thrown together by an employee of a gossip rag, who included all of the salacious parts of a famous person's life, but none of that person's interiority.Totally see why it's a bestseller.

She was born Evelyn Elena Herrera, daughter of Cuban parents, but had to change her name by Evelyn Hugo.She talks about how she made her way to L.A, how much she sacrificed and her husbands, of course.My 3 favorite husbands are: Rex North (he was one of my 3 favorite marriages) to get more money for the movie their starring: Anna Karenina (the gods know how I much love Anna Karenina, so I\'d have given my kidney or soul to see that movie). They both agreed to this plan and they\'re happy this way... Until Rex\'s pair, Joy, is pregnant and they want to get married. Celia is also married with John Braverman.Harry. hE IS MY PRETTY BABY, I LOVE HIM SO MUCH. DKFJDJFGHJFG. I really loved Harry, he and Evelyn are best friends, wich makes their relationship normal and not forced. Evelyn and Celia get back together, and Harry and John are dating, which is cuTE, DON\'T TOUCH MY KIDS. Evelyn and Harry have a kid: Connor. And then, everything goes downhill when Evelyn films a movie with her abusive ex-husband, Don Adler, and make a sex scene.Celia is sick and knows she\'s gonna die, so they form this plan to move to Spain, Evelyn has to marry Celia\'s brother, Robert (he\'s the third), so Celia\'s things belong to her when she dies. They do it, but then, Harry dies in a car accident, where was another man with him. Evelyn is devastated by the loss of her best friend and let me tell you that I cried so much with this.When Celia died, a big part of me died with her. It was heartbreaking.""I had lost her. My love. My Celia. My soulmate. The woman whose love I\'d spent my life earning.It broke me. I cried until my head hurted.The pacing was amazing. It grab you from the beginning and lemme tell you tHAT THIS WAS ADDICTIVE. I wanted to know more and more, until I got to the end, until there was nothing but my broken heart and my tears falling on my shirt.The characters had an incredible an amazing development. You fall for most of them, and wanna kick many of them too. *cough* Don, Mick, Max. *cough*Evelyn is such a badass woman. A legend. An icon. Not just that. She was a wife, a mother, a lover, a friend. She was not just her talen and her great body.I fell in love with her and her story, with many of her husbands and her wife.My heart is broken tbh. But this book is totally worth of it.I laughed with Evelyn, I cried with and for her, I get angry and sad... I just fell.And the twist for Monique? Ugh, that ruined me as well.All the feelings in this book are deep and explores the sexuality and feelings of a woman who didn\'t know she could feel more for someone else than a man. And I\'m glad that she and Celia got married at the end. :\')I didn\'t know the complexity of this book, and the hype is worth it!!!ALL I KNOW IS THAT I WANT A CELIA ST.

I don't think I've ever had as immediate a reaction as I did to reading this book. I feel like my updates have made my distaste for this book pretty evident, but in case it wasn't I'm going to walk through all the things I hated about this book one final time before I try and put as much space between me and this work of fiction as humanly possible.I knew going into the book that Evelyn Hugo was a Latinx character, it wasn't until I started reading though that I discovered our other narrator, Monique, was also a woman of color. [ Don't call her black though, she's biracial. ] And almost immediately I was uncomfortable with this ide. That said I carried on thinking that I was probably just stretching, reaching for things that weren't there. That said I think that the narrative utterly fails at the nuance necessary to tell the story of a Cuban-American finding success in the 50s. Utterly fails to depict the nuance in the way that someone like Evelyn would have to navigate the world, or how her racial identity would have had an impact on most of the things she experienced in life. It's really only brought up at the beginning when she's initially denied roles and Evelyn immediately pivots into this racially ambiguous/spicy white category that she's happy with becuase it ensures her success. That doesn't stop her from later bing mad that her maid doesn't know she's Cuban even though she's actively tried to supress that side of her for literally decades. I won't even get into how the narrative makes Evelyn retiring to Spain to make tortillas her reconnecting with her Cuban roots or how Monique actively distances heself from blackness while never questioning the impact that being raised by a single white mother following the death of her black father might have any role in that. You really mean to tell me that she has memories of her father but not his family? That the first black person she met was a girl in elementary school? Okay. Sidenote Evelyn just randomly dropping that she supported civil rights and MLK Jr towards the end of the book felt totally out of place and while not a big deal that part of the book felt very disconnected from what else was going on.I didn't feel attached to any of the characters really, let alone any of the seven husbands. I have ones I thought were more interesting, but that's only because so did TJR and they were the ones given more time on the page. None of the characters that appear in the novel though are nearly as developed as Evelyn Hugo, something that I think makes it easier for a reader to be drawn to. There is literally no one else. No one is given the time or energy, even the major players in her life. I didn't think that the love story between Evelyn and the person that would be the lover her life was all that compelling if anything I thought that that person was actually lowkey terrible and the romance they shared was almost certainly nothing to write home about.There are a number of deaths in this book, and again, didn't care about any of them.At the end of the day though I did enjoy the voice of Evelyn Hugo, the character to be clear. Though the most revolutionary thing about her is being a bisexual character in their 70s, there's just something about characters like Evelyn that I will always support and that's no different here. Again though it helps that Evelyn is easily the only character crafted with any kind of depth.I can't in good faith recommend that anyone read this book. I got very little enjoyment, but also there is nothing to gain? I realize and appreciate that my thoughts are in the minority here and I in no way feel like my opinion will ever be the one most agree with. If you do decide to pick this up I hope that you are able to enjoy it in ways I couldn't.Also just a warning but this book details incestuous thoughts of child sexual assault, actual child sexual assault/pedophilia, and abuse in general [ definitely physical, emotional up for discussion I'd say ] so just know that if you want to pick this up.2022 re-read thoughtsI wish that I could say that I liked this more the second time, but that would be a lie...Or at least, partly a lie. I don't think that I can raise the rating even if I objectively had a better time reading it knowing the full scope of the story I was going to be getting. Maybe the gut punch of the end of the book being so insensitive being taken out of the equation was enough for me to have a better time, I don't know.I do think that there are elements that work well here. I still think that Evelyn is an interesting character to follow with a very distinctive voice that I would appreciate in the hands of any other author. I feel comfortable saying that because I have enjoyed many a character that share her achetype.For me the ways that race were handled poorly weren't so glaringly annoying this time as much as Celia being a horrible character. From the microaggressions at the first time she and Evelyn have a meal together to the way that she acts for years toward Evelyn. It never comes across as a 'good for her' moment, her standing up for herself... but as shaming Evelyn for doing things that she herself is not doing? Shaming Evelyn for making choices that are good for both of them. I get that communication is hard... but Celia and Evelyn take this to a whole new level. It was childish. It didn't serve love of her life... It didn't serve the one that got away. I deserved better as a reader quite frankly.All of that is to say that the book giving 20ish pages to the explanation as to why Monique was chosen for this opportunity... still by far the worst part of the book. Everything about that getting wrapped up is so rushed. While the whole book feels very surface level, that in particular is damn near unforgivable. Monique deserved better as a character, the readers deserves more, and that TJR thought it was acceptable is pure foolishness.I still think everyone who has wanted to read this has read it at this point... But it really shouldn't be on anyone's tbr. It's definitely not worth the time, even with all the potential this story has.""}]"

La guerra (Blackwater, #4)

È l’alba di una nuova èra per il clan Caskey e nulla sarà mai più come prima. La determinazione di Elinor finalmente dà i suoi frutti. I nemici di ieri diverranno gli amici di domani e i mutamenti giungeranno da luoghi inaspettati.Anche per il mondo si apre una nuova èra, portatrice però di pericolo e distruzione: il conflitto in Europa farà affluire sangue nuovo a Perdido. Nella proprietà dei Caskey, gli uomini vanno e vengono. Come marionette che non sanno di essere appese a un filo.","[{'rating': 4, 'content': ""The War focuses primarily on the younger Caskey members and is overall less riveting than the other books, but not without intrigue. There's one deliciously gruesome scene, we learn a bit more about the mysterious Eleanor, and there's the necessary passage of time as the epic slowly escalates into what I hope will be a boiling climax.This far in it's hard to rate the book as a separate entity since this is just a segment of single novel and not really a series. All I know is, I'm still obsessed and still rushing to turn the next page. Blackwater is so unexpected and unconventional for a horror novel, yet it works so well. I can't turn away!""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Cuarta parte de la novela por entregas. Ya queda menos para el desenlace.En esta parte, McDowell se vuelve a centrar en los personajes y en las dinámicas familiares y de poder tras el giro que dio la novela en la tercera entrega. El ritmo es más pausado que en las anteriores, y el giro final más previsible. Miriam y Frances, las dos hijas de Elinor toman un papel mucho más relevante. Me ha alegrado volver a saber de Grace y conocer algo más de Lucille. Óscar y James, muy envejecido, siguen teniendo un papel secundario supeditado al de las mujeres del clan.Vamos a conocer algo más sobre la naturaleza de Elinor y Frances, solo un poco, no hacerse ilusiones. Confirmaremos alguna que otra cosilla, pero los porqués, los cómos y todo eso que nos tienen en vilo ahí siguen pendientes. Qué habilidad tiene McDowell para revelar lo justo para mantener el interés. A estas alturas de la novela yo esperaba poder anticipar algo más, pero no, sigo sin saber ni hacia dónde vamos ni por dónde va a tirar.Cronológicamente se sitúa entre 1940 y el final de la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Fueron los años en los que el panorama económico y social cambió de manera drástica en EEUU. Triste es decirlo, pero con la guerra se superaron las consecuencias de la depresión del 29 y el país prosperó. Hay que reconocerle a este autor que, en pocos trazos y siempre con Perdido y la familia Caskey como protagonistas, nos muestra ese contexto social y lo que supuso.El final, como ya viene siendo habitual, te deja jurando en arameo por no tener publicada la siguiente. ¡Qué largos se me van a hacer los quince días que quedan! Recomendable.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '""En aquel tranquilo rincón rural de Alabama reinaba una actividad frenética, sin precedentes. Los contratos del Departamento de Defensa reportaron tanto dinero que Oscar consideró oportuno aumentar los salarios de forma generalizada en dos ocasiones durante los seis primeros meses de la guerra. Los trabajadores invertían sus nuevos ingresos en Perdido. Las tiendas que habían cerrado al inicio de la Depresión abrieron de nuevo y empezaron a prosperar de inmediato.Incluso Baptist Bottom mejoró. Los hombres negros trabajaban en el aserradero o se alistaban en el Ejército. Las mujeres negras se hicieron cargo de hogares blancos en los que tanto el marido como la mujer tenían que trabajar. A partir de los trece años, las chicas negras se vieron empujadas al servicio.""El extracto anterior es un claro ejemplo de la nueva situación que viven en Perdido a causa del inicio de la Segunda Guerra Mundial.Seguimos en el mismo pueblo, en Alabama, corre el año 1938 cuando se abre este tomo.En este cuarto volumen percibimos un tono más calmado, en el que McDowell se toma su tiempo para reordenar la situación conforme las nuevas generaciones pasan a formar parte y a tomar más protagonismo en este cambio de ciclo.La novela comienza en la antesala de la participación norteamericana en dicha guerra. Las tropas del país comienzan a movilizarse. Perdido,\xa0se empieza a llenar de soldados que visitan el pueblo en sus días libres. Viéndose así alteradas las rutinas diarias del lugar como ya pasó con la construcción del dique, y por consiguiente se dan cambios en su estructura social. Todo ello traerá sangre nueva a un clan que se ve cada vez más envejecido, en especial nuestro querido James Caskey.Si bien tiene ese tono más pausado, no está carente de momentos tensos y sorprendentes, tal y como McDowell nos tiene ya acostumbrados con esa habilidad para revelar lo justo y necesario, pasando de relatarnos ese ambiente en apariencia bucólico y costumbrista típicamente sureño, a dejarnos helados con esas situaciones tensas y violentas, donde los secretos, secretos que implican a Elinor y a parte de su prole, se van destapando muy poco a poco y de los que estamos deseando saber más, mucho más.Por lo que la siguiente entrega intuyo que vendrá cargada de grandes y terroríficas revelaciones.Nos leemos en el siguiente 🤓📖🚪""¿A ti también te da pesadillas, esa habitación?""https://m.facebook.com/profile.php/?i...🖤📖'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Come i precedenti volumi, anche questa volta, ovviamente la storia si conclude proprio sul più bello ed è impossibile fermarsi perchè la curiosità è a mille.

De hecho, la saga familiar los Caskey, no solo mantiene sus comodidades, si no que consigue sacar rendimiento de la guerra. Al final, los ricos se vuelven más ricos en tiempos revueltos. Nuevos amores florecerán entre incertidumbres, nacimientos y pérdidas, la vida y la muerte se dan la mano.Me he llevado una grata sorpresa con ""La guerra"", el cuarto volumen de la saga Blackwater, y es que habiendo leído tantas opiniones sobre la saga, no solía ser de las entregas que más entusiasmaban a los lectores, y debo decir que, sin embargo, a mí me ha gustado mucho, y aunque mi favorito sigue siendo el tercero, este se ha quedado muy pegadito a él.Creo que lo que más estoy disfrutando de Blackwater en este punto, además de los momentos espeluznantes y deliciosamente sangrientos, es poder ser espectador del transcurso de toda la vida de personajes a los que les he cogido tanto cariño. Elinor, James, Frances, Queenie o Grace, entre otros, me han cautivado por completo, consiguiendo que me interese saber que será de sus vidas, hasta hacerme sufrir por algunas pérdidas o ciertos momentos. En relación a Grace, ya en el último libro tuve la impresión de que era un personaje con mucho potencial. No me equivocaba. Es una de las grandes protagonistas de esta entrega y su trama me ha aportado grandes satisfacciones. No diré más, para evitar los spoilers, pero ¡qué alegría lo que ocurre!Otra cosa que he disfrutado mucho en este libro es la relación tan especial que mantienen Elinor y su hija Frances, personajazos con muchos cambios y secretos que terminan abriéndose la una a la otra. Las dos tienen varias escenas que me han parecido de las más emotivas y bonitas de la saga. Ojalá el autor nos muestre algunas más de este tipo en los tomos que faltan.A pesar de que esta entrega es, sin lugar a dudas, la menos sobrenatural de todas y carece de tantos momentos terroríficos como tenía su predecesora, sí que tiene una escena increíble en ese sentido. Esta parte se centra en lo más terrenal, en la violencia humana y en la evolución de sus personajes y la relación entre ellos. Creo que Blackwater IV es la que más se permite pararse a mirar a sus protagonistas, dejarlos evolucionar, permitiendo conocerlos mejor. Y eso, como lector, se agradece mucho.En definitiva, esta saga está creándome un enganche increíble, y jamás pensé que las idas y venidas de los ricos y pijos familiares de un perdido pueblo de Alabama con puntuales toques de terror pudieran resultarme tan adictivas. Pero aquí estamos, dispuesto a empezar el quinto volumen muy pronto.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'J’ai été assez surpris de voir beaucoup de gens parler de ce tome comme étant le meilleur de la saga. Pour ma part, c’est vraiment celui qui m’a le moins convaincu (même si ça reste page turner et divertissant).⠀Suite aux événements tragiques (ça dépend pour qui…) du tome 3, on se doutait que la dynamique de toute la série allait changer, et c’est effectivement ce qu’il s’est passé. D’une manière générale, j’ai trouvé que ce tome était plus gentillet que les autres. Il se passe des choses graves, c’est vrai, mais les relations entre les membres de la famille Caskey sont nettement moins conflictuelles et on a donc presque l’impression de lire une saga différente.⠀Pour parler de choses plus positives, j’ai adoré en apprendre (un peu) plus sur la nature d’Elinor et de sa fille qui commence à comprendre qu’elle est différente. On est loin de tout savoir mais on sent que l’auteur voit la fin arriver et qu’il se prépare à nous donner les réponses qu’on attend.⠀En somme, c’était un tome plutôt efficace, qui fait avancer l’histoire, mais qui dénote quand même un peu par rapport au reste de la saga.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Triumphs and tragedies. Interesting character development.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'The fourth book in this series is just as good as the others. (Though so far the first one holds the best book in the series spot.)It\'s hard to review a book from a series without spoiling anything, but suffice it to say, that I\'m very late for a group read and I co-moderate that group! I\'m also late on a couple of read to reviews. So this means, I have to set this series aside for a brief time while I fulfill my other reading obligations.I\'m not happy about that. This type of story, written the way McDowell has written it...it\'s impossible not to think about. The family is written as such that I think I know them better than I know my own family. I feel connected to them. I love some of them and hate others, but I feel connected just the same. It turns out that one of the family members is gay and this passage explained how that went over in the small Alabama town of Perdido.(*This passage is very slightly spoiler-ish*):""Southerners are an easygoing race when it comes to aberrations of conduct. They will react with anger if something out of the ordinary is presented as a possible future occurrence; but if an unusual circumstance is discovered to be an established fact, they will usually accept it without rancor or judgment as part of the normal order of things. To have informed the men who hung about the seed and feed stores that two women had bought Gavin Pond and were turning it into the biggest farm in the county would have brought out calls to repeal the voting rights amendment; but when confronted with Grace the men were perfectly willing to accept her, her cousin Lucille , and Lucille\'s little boy.""So, all that doesn\'t tell you much, but that\'s all I can say without spoilers. There is still a deep mystery hidden within Elinor and within the town of Perdido and its river, and I can\'t wait to find out what it is. But I have to.Recommended for fans of 80\'s horror, soap operas, mysteries'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""«Io ci sono stata nel gorgo»«Beh, allora dimmi: che cosa c'è là sotto?»«La mamma...»Che dire, questa saganon finisce di stupire: il suo quarto volume,“La guerra”, è forse quello che mi è piaciuto di più fino ad ora, quellopiù intimo, in cui i personaggi affrontano la più grande crescita personale.E poi, come per i precedenti, il libro finisce propriosul più bello, lasciando il lettore desideroso di saperne di più.

is well on his way to becoming a professional rugby player. he has dedicated his entire life to this sport…rugby being his only focus. no partying, no drinking, no drugs, and especially no girls. shannon lynch is a 15 year old girl in desperate need of a fresh start. when she leaves her bullies behind at her old school and transfers to tommen, her only focus is to keep a low profile. she has secrets that she wants to keep hidden. she trusts no one and tries her best not to be seen. johnny kavanaghseesher though…only her, the mysterious girl with the lonely, sad eyes. he has to stay focused on rugby, but he can’t get the look in her eyes out of his mind. he can’t getherout of his mind. what happens when she suddenly becomes his main focus? will he find out the truth? can she trust him?❥ 𝓂𝓎 𝓉𝒽𝑜𝓊𝑔𝒽𝓉𝓈:first and foremost, to my lovely younger readers out there…this series is listed as YA, but please trust me when i tell you that it shouldn’t be. these books have some very dark topics that they focus on so please don’t go into this thinking it’s just about some cute, fluffy romances. with that being said, this bookruinedme.you can find my shattered heart scattered

scared, but excited nonetheless to continue this series. scared because the ending of this book was criminal, i’m still shaken up by it🥺❥ 𝓌𝓇𝒾𝓉𝒾𝓃𝑔/𝓅𝒶𝒸𝒾𝓃𝑔:i enjoyed the writing a lot!! since the story takes place in ireland, a lot of irish slang is used. there’s a glossary in the beginning of the book with the meanings of all the words in case you’re not familiar with them and i loved that!!! it made the writing really easy to read and it was a bonus because i’m irish🥹the writing was absolutely amazing. it blows my mind that a 600+ page book pulled me out of a reading slump that i was stuck in for a month. that’s just how you know the writing was good. as soon as i started this book, i couldn’t put it down. i was completely invested in every single page. a few of you asked me about the size difference of the books and if there was anything cut out. for example, the indie versions were really thick, the uk versions are thick, but the new bloom books editions are way thinner. basically, bloom books made the pages thinner. i’m not too sure how that works, but nothing of the original book was cut out! just thinner pages with a tiny font. please don’t let the length of the book put you off, it’s a long book for a reason. there’s so much story telling and honestly…i’m just sad it wasn’t longer.°❀⋆.ೃ࿔*:･she closed her eyes and bit down even harder on her lip, so hard that

equivalent to ripping out each individual hair follicle on my head.i actually can\'t believe i avoided every spoiler on this book like the mf plague thinking this series was gonna be a banger. all that hard work for nothing. wattpad, i\'m so sorry for ever comparing this book to you. i\'ve read books on wattpad a million times better than whatever the fuck i just read.alright lets begin.the length. the length of this book is enough to make me go dizzy. 626 pages in the copy i had, but other copies have over 800 pages. what is going on here? chloe walsh, may i introduce you to an editor perhaps? this book did not need to be as long as it was. and i genuinely thought since it was so long there would actually be shit happening in the book. i was mistaken. the book had absolutely nothing going on for about 99% of it, and that\'s me being generous.chloe walsh must have thought she was saving the environment the way she recycled every single conversation and plot overnovernovernover again. basically just johnny driving shannon home every day and them having the same conversations. didn\'t realize he was signing up to be her chauffeur.shannonwhy in the fucking hell did i need to hear how small shannonlike the riveris every 5 seconds? there is absolutely no reason for me to be reading about how small she is the number of times i did.WE FUCKING GET IT.i was tired of it by the second page. yes, the second page. you read that correctly. it had already been mentioned at least 5 times by then. and then a million more times afterwards. shannonlike the riverand her tiny bone structure. she\'s so small and unable to do anything for herself. she needs literally anyone else to help her do the most basic human tasks.the way this character is infantilized and then sexualized is disturbing. they constantly remind us of how tiny she is and how she acts like a child. she legitimately cannot do anything without needing help from someone else. you would think she would have some sort of development by the end of the book but she remains unchanged. her whole home life plot is explored so little you could literally forget its a factor. the book had more than enough pages to delve into that plot. but all we\'re supposed to care about is this girl\'s constant loop of a relationship with the popular rugby player. not the reason why she is literally emotionally and physically stunted. she acts like a child but we\'re told she\'s actually ""mature"" lol okay. and then they love to mention her body every 5 seconds and how hot johnny and other boys find her.johnnygenuinely thought his name was josh the entire first half of the book. i hate this kid. all he did was talk about his dick for half the book, and how hot and tiny shannonlike the riveris and everything he wanted to do to her. being inside his head was the most painful experience of my life. the repetitive nonstop inner monologues really made me homicidal. pure torture it was putting myself through this. i could skip pages and still wind up back in the same spot.he loved to create problems for him and shannonlike the riverout of thin air. one of the dumbest characters i\'ve read about in a while. it was fun laughing at him sometimes though so at least there\'s that.where was the love? the chemistry? the connection? there was over 600 pages and somehow nothing to convince me these two were made for each other. johnny needs to get his ass back to dublin and shannonlike the riverneeds years of therapy and a stable household.anyways see below the big josh and tiny shannon. how lovely!joeyhe barely was in this book but he is the only good thing in it. carried the book. there is no way i would enjoy any other book in this series, but this man is a gem. i will appreciate his character from afar but i truly do love him so much.i brought the review back bc fuck the bullies yall can stay mad.───when the plan to br finally makes it out the dms 🤭iqralets hope we love it or hate it together <3'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'it’s been a long time since I’ve read a book where i don’t want it to end.i was expecting this book to be the typical high school romance where jock meets shy girl and ya it kinda is but it’s definitely much more. i love books that focuses on the characters, friendships, relationships and family dynamics and this book has all of it. tbh, i wasn’t gonna read this book but the rating is so high and i was curious and all but i’m so glad i did.ALSO, i wasn’t expecting this book to have aMariana Zapata type of slow burnand i was all for it. and i know this book is long af but it’s like that because there’smore showing than tellingand i loved this.story & charactersthis book is long af but it didn’t feel long. if books are like this, you know it’s really freakin good and it is.what drew me in are the characters. the story is pretty simple: girl gets bullied in her old school, she transfers to a more preppy/private school, she meets the most popular guy who also happens to be a rugby prodigy, they fall in love slowly but they both hide it from each other cuz duh its forbidden and all that. you know the drill. but the characters? fucking great. they were so relatable, hilarious, and the banter? the best thing i’ve read in a long time.the side characters,Gibsie(H bff) andClaire(h bff) are THE BEST. i don’t think i’ve ever laughed so hard, i feel nonexistent abs forming on my tummy until Gibsie is introduced in my book-life. and Claire? she’s the kind of friend every girl needs. both of these characters’ loyalty and support was so refreshing to read, i just love em and i ship both of these characters so bad too.Shannon (h) & Johnny (H)i felt so bad for Shannon that i just wanted to protect her from every single person who bullied and abused her. and knowing and reading about how she was being abused by her father? ughhhhh MY HEART. Shannon may seem weak, innocent, awkward, and naive (which is understandable after what she’s been through), but she’s actually so fucking strong, mature, the sweetest thing ever, and quite admirable tbh.and omfg Johnny is the best hero i’ve read in a loooong time. he’s the perfect balance of sweet and alpha/protective/possessive type of hero. even though his pushing away from the heroine and implicitly leading her on frustrated me to no end, i’m still really glad that he was the onedoing most of the chase. he may say to her he’s not interested but i mean, actions speak louder than words right?im also so glad that Shannon calls Johnny out when he makes mistakes instead of just “giving in” just because, you know, he’s hot. ugh*cue eyeroll*. i’ve seen this trend in soo many NA books that it’s annoying as hell but thank god Shannon ain’t one of those weak and doormat/horny heroines.dramawellll most of the drama here is the push and pull from both MCs, it can get frustrating, not gonna lie, but it’s definitely worth it.the OW drama here was kinda entertaining but also kinda not important? i don’t know it just feels like it’s there for the sake of drama or putting a wedge between the MCs and im honestly not complaining because i’ve been in the mood for petty teenage drama for quite a while.anywaysss, this book doesn’t have sex in it and it focuses a lot more on the stages of slowly and innocently (but genuinely) falling in love with your soulmate so if you like that, i recommend this 100%.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '""Boom, boom, fucking boom...I\'m done for.""Am honestly at a loss for words. I loved this book so much, it\'sdefinitely one of my favoritesfrom now on. Y\'all that ending was so heart breaking and yet I find myself being happy and loving that pain cause the book was THAT good.In no way it\'s a perfect book, it\'s flawed and the writing may not work for everyone, the pacing is slow but the characters and story are simply captivating.In thischaracter driven story,you\'ll find yourself rooting for them, understanding their pain and trauma, focusing on relationships, family dynamics and their growth as individuals.✔️ Sports romance (rugby)✔️ High School romance✔️ Slow burn✔️ Dual pov✔️ Set in Ireland during the timeframe of 2005✔️ Found family✔️ ""Who did this to you""It\'s only after I bought the whole series that I found out it\'s a high school romance, it did make me skeptical yet it worked out brilliantly. I especially loved how the actual sport played an important part in the story. I absolutely LOVE watching rugby, so having the inclusion of that made it even a better experience for me.Coming to the characters,Shannon and Johnnyhave my heart. These two are so adorable and so smitten by each other. I loved seeing them progress as strangers, to friends and eventually finally accepting their feelings for each other. The romance is so sweet and had me giggling.🩷Shannonis one of those characters who deserve the whole freaking world. She\'s been through so much, I wish I could give her the biggest hug. I honestly don\'t understand how people can find her annoying. Poor girl is so vulnerable and to see her open her heart and start trusting Johnny was such a proud moment for me. I hate what\'s happening to her. I wish she would reach out and accept help, I simply wish someone would save her and her brothers 😭🏉Johnnyis a fun, dorky and such a loving character. I admire his dedication to rugby and how loyal his teammates are to him, and he to them. His persona instantly puts people at ease and also the guy is straightforward- me likey. But to see him put himself through so much pain to achieve his goals was heartbreaking. I found myself relating to some of his struggles as I have been going through the same, so he does have a soft spot in my heart. I loved the scene in the hospital when he was high tbh, it was funny and so honest from him lol.Theside charactersare equally impactful and so easy to like.Joeyis someone am really rooting for. I want to see him happy so bad it breaks my heart. I want to get to knowAoifemore, she seems so sweet.Claire and Gibsie?Oh gosh, I ship it so hard 😩😩 I love Gibsie, he\'s so loyal and the sense of humor is elite lol.Lizzyseems upfront and seems to be hiding her own struggles but that\'s all I know about her. Shannon\'s parents and Bella can die, if I start ranting about how much I hate them this review will never end.Theendingbroke me as it ends on a sad and brutal note. I was expecting it to happen yet it hurt so bad. I have so much hope for the next book, hopefully will love it the same if not more.Highly recommended.Please check trigger warnings before reading this book.~•~•~Am so intimidated by the size of this book but IT\'S TIMEEEEEE'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '(4.25 ⭐️) Hi Johnny. Hi Shannon. 🥹'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '“now tell me who made you cry & i’ll fix it”i don’t think i’ll ever recover from this story. johnny is officially my favorite ❤️\u200d🩹'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'DNF @ pg 231.i went into this book hoping for a fun time and not take it too seriously but it was just horrendous.there were like two cute moments but other than that the writing was bad, i was not invested and there were some lines that made me gasp out loud because of how gross they are (e.g. ableist, transphobic, misogynistic) e.g.:- the main character says how her eyes are ""too big"" for her face so she tries to squint. ""the squinting only made me look disabled"" ??????? this was on page one so i should have KNOWN not to trust it would get any better- ""a girl, a fuckingfemale""- the main guy johnny to one of his guy friends: ""i hurt your feelings? who\'s the bitch with a vagina now?""anyway, save yourselves & don\'t read this book 😅'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""4.05!!“Boom, boom, fucking boom,”JOHNNY KAVANAGH FANS LOOK AWAY!!The first 200 pages of this book were absolutely horrendous, atrocious, the worst 200 pages that I have ever read in my life. I was so bleckh'd out by the fact that shannon was 15 and the amount of dick talks and dick mentions in Johnny's chapter was so infuriating like every fucking second you'd look at the book and it would Johnny and his dick being described LIKE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE STOP MENTIONING HIS POGO STICK+ the actual meaning of binding 13 💀💀. However, the remaining 600 pages were so much better, such a massive improvement, it captivated me and I enjoyed it soo much and the fact that I read it fast. I was topping because my house was getting fumigated so had to look at that and the moving took a lot of my time but this never let me let go of its grip. I would say I loved Shannons story and it gripped so much more than Johnny's, his was ok, I preferred reading about Shannon more. Her chapters were the redeeming part in my opinion.“¨I think I need you for keeps.¨¨I think I need you for keeps, too.¨”Johnny Kavanagh,He was such an asshole. I loved him when he was Shannon but when he was not? I hated him. He was a manwhore with the way he passed on from one woman to another but that was before Shannon and we didnt get enough page time so it did not bother me, what bothered me was the fact that he treated his friends like they were trash, threatening them, snapping at them. I remember hughie asking if he wanted lunch and Johnny was talking to shannon and instead of politely declining'Fuck off' He snappedlike come on man! and the way he treated Gibsie and all, I would never treat my friends like that, besides that I dont understand why he would punch the boyfriends of the girls who bullied Shannon when it wasn't even their fault like?? they dont control them?? and what would he do if that girl didnt have a bf? anyways, to the bfs who bullied shannon it was understandable but Cormac? did they not smooth things over? yes, they did but he still punched her for the doings of Bella even tho Cormac had nothing to do with it. What an asshole. Also, I love Joey and he was a bitch to him so -1 point for that. However his scenes with Shannon made me like him a lot, I love how considerate he was of her and how her life got better because of him and how much effort he put in for her.Shannon Lynch,My heart broke for her. I did not care for anyone besides her and Joey. I loved her story so much and ugh I hated what she went through if only I could give her a big hug and take all of her siblings with her to somewhere safe because I cannot imagine spending your childhood like that, so full of horror and trauma. it wasn't just her house but her school, her community. I was so pissed!! I could see her frustration, her anger and her resolve, her breakdown. It was actually heartbreaking to see what she went through but her story was so engaging and loved how her story was so easily redeemable.Joey, Aoife, Bella, Mam and Da, its a disgrace to put Joey and Aoife with them but I had to because I love them and I cant wait to read their story, Bella, Ma and Da can rot in hell.“I carefully scrolled through his playlists and almost had a heart attack when my eyes landed on the one named Songs for Shannon.”The romance was actually so sweet. I loved the slow burn and it was actually nice to see that they weren't in each others throats every two minutes. I enjoyed the sweet moments we got between them, Johnny really did care for her and gave her everything, I would like to see how their romance progresses in the next book considering the events of the end and how Johnny doesn't know but it was refreshing to see how it unraveled through this book.Overall, a solid novel!!

There\'s this saying that you don\'t find a book but a book finds it way to you and it\'s so true because I have been ignoring this series for over a year but this year I finally caved in and guess who\'s obsessed? ME! I was just 10 chapters in the story and I already knew I was going to give it 5 stars.He smiled down at me. “Hi, Shannon.”“Hi, Johnny,” I whispered, staring back at him, feeling like my heart was two seconds away from bursting out of my chest.I was a bit scared to read this because I rarely read high school romances where teenagers behave like a bunch of rich kids who thinks they are the king of the world. But this book was so realistic in terms of high school trope and I loved how Chloe actually didn\'t wrote her characters as some rich assholes who are too good for the world. All the characters were teenagers going through that crazy and young phase but they were written in such a real and realistic way. Yes, there were some cringy and cliché moments but they are teenagers so it was absolutely understandable.“She was nice to think about. She was fucking beautiful. Her voice. Her hair. Her smell. The way she spoke. Every single part of her.”The plot is more of character-drivenand the pacing was slow but I definitely don\'t mind it because I never wanted to end this book. Chloe can write ten books about Johnny and Shannon doing dumb ass shit and I would still read them with hearts in my eyes. I loved the writing because it was easy to read and captivating and it worked well for me because it\'s a 500 plus pages book. This might be not everyone\'s writing style because there was no flowery euphemisms or allegories. I love how the story was not just focused on the romance part.The character\'s development was slow but done so well and there\'s still a lot to unpack in Keeping 13 but I love it because healing is not a linearand I would love if there is a real growth to Shannon and Johnny\'s character. I also loved the found family trope in this one.“Look at me,” he repeated, tone calm and coaxing. I couldn’t. I felt him shift beside me and then his fingers were on my chin, tipping my face up to his. “You’re safe,” he whispered, cupping my cheek in his hand, eyes boring holes straight through my soul. “I promise.”This book is the slowest slow-burn I have ever read in my lifeand I didn\'t hated a bit even though I was dying for them to kiss each other and when that happened I was literally dead because they are so adorable. The way they met for the first time was so funny and adorable and I immediately knew right then that they are going to be my new obsession and my new comfort couple. I have never felt this many butterflies in my stomach while reading a book about two teenage people who are madly in love with each other but refuse to accept their feelings.“Well, thanks for caring,” I breathed.“Thanks for being worth it,” Johnny replied, hand still on my cheek.➸ Shannon LynchThe girl with sad eyes. The moment I saw her I had this immediate need to protect her from the world. Her story broke my heart 🥺 She deserves the best in the world. Shannon\'s is such a vulnerable and fragile girl with the biggest and the kindest heart in the world. She\'s the quiet one with the traumatic childhood and school experience who just wanted a clean slate at a new school. I hate how people treated her at her old school and I\'m glad Johnny beat the shit out of them for calling her out by names. She\'s used to being alone, has trust issues, build a huge wall around herself to protect her, never had anyone by her side except her brother Joey. She\'s been dealing through a shit life and has no self-confidence and self-esteem because people treated her like shit all her life. I hate it when the authors or the mmc can\'t shut up about how the fmc is so small and short and tiny and Chloe did exactly the same but I think it was done to portrayed her character as vulnerable or fragile girl and to make readers empathise with her. She has a lot to heal and move on from in her life but she\'s doing it all her pace with Johnny and her loved ones by her side.“For once in my life, I wanted a safe place to run to instead of from. I felt like I was slowly dying in that house. In my home. Where I was supposed to lay my head. Where I was supposed to feel safe.”➸ Johnny KavanaghHE IS THE DEFINITION OF BOY OBSESSED AND WHO DID THAT TO YOU TROPE.He\'s broody and a bit grumpy with all that""Rugby is my life""attitude but he\'s so thoughtful, respectful, caring, and just incredible. He has DIMPLES AND HE LOVES DOGS? HE\'S PERFECT! I hate it when man picks fight for their woman like she can\'t do that herself but Johnny is an exception. I\'d let him slay all my dragons if he wants to. He did that with Shannon, fought on her behalf, threatened the kids at his school to not talk shit about her and it\'s not because he\'s strong and all, it was because he wanted and needed to protect her and he wanted her to protect him in some way. His povs were everything! He\'s a very strong minded person with a very obsessive personality. No matter how perfect he appears to all the other people, Johnny is such a scared boy with dreams and hopes. He has his own demons and fears that can destroy his career and I get it why he tried to hide his injury from everyone because no body wants to see how you can lose everything you have worked for your whole life destroy right in front of your eyes.“Problem was, every time she ran, I found myself chasing right after her, desperate to just be with her.”╰┈➤ Shannon & JohnnyRight person, Right time.They make my heart go like WOAH. They are complete opposites of each other in terms of status, personality and upbringing. He wants to save her and she wants to hide from her past and everything. She\'s a damaged soul but he\'s determined to save her and love her. They had me swooning and giggling at Every. Damn. Moment. The giddiness I felt when they were in formed proximity and when Johnny was driving her to home and everytime he threatened the kids at school to stay away from“My Shannon”(don\'t love it when they lay claims on woman but it\'s Johnny so he can do anything to me). He had a playlist of songs that reminded him of her and they were all love songs and he spent thirty minutes in rain trying to find her shoe and you are telling me he is fictional 😭 He tried to find ways to spend time with her because his heart didn\'t wanted to let go of her.“Someone touched you,” Johnny whispered in my ear, placing his fingers on the marks. “I want to know who.”“Now,” I sneered, glaring down at their faces. “Who wants to call my girlfriend a whore to my face?”“Give me a name,” Johnny growled, dropping his hands to his hips. “And I’ll take care of it.”“What— no! I’m grand,” I quickly replied. “I have allergies.”“Me too. To assholes and bullshit,” Johnny snarled.“Now, tell me who made you cry and I’ll fix it.”The feminist in me is dead after meeting Johnny Kavanagh🤸🏽\u200d♀️He wanted to be her friend but also couldn\'t be her friend and all the dilemma, confusions, denials and bulldozing (Iykyk) worked so well in the end. I love that they just didn\'t had this lust and tension between them but they also had an emotional and intimate connection. They understood each other so well and helped each other in their own way. They had this easy going relationship and friendship. The way Johnny made everything easy for Shannon at school, the way he protected her, loved her, took care of her everytime, and the way Shannon saw the real Johnny behind Johnny the perfect boy and the perfect rugby player. Johnny was so patient with her and waited for her to open up to him about her abusive life. How he was afraid of talking to her about his insecurities and fears yet he tried his best with her. They are just so so prefect for each other. Definitely soulmates!“Shannon.” Johnny’s hand snaked out and wrapped around my wrist. “I don’t want you to go,” he said gruffly, tugging me back down beside him. “I want you here.” He rested a hand on the bed right behind my back and leaned close. “I want you to stay with me.”— Side Characters —➸ Joey:Perfect brother and I already love him. Can\'t wait to read his book but I already know his book is going to break my heart in pieces.➸ Aoife:She\'s so precious and I love the way she\'s always there for Joey and his family.➸ Claire:Love love love her. She\'s the best with her kind-hearted spirit and sweet nature. She\'s the type of friend who would hype you up all the damn time.➸ Gibsie:He was a bit annoying in the start but his character grew on me a lot. His friendship with Johnny is so precious. I can\'t wait for his book. Claire and Gibsie literally behaved like a married couple in this book. He follows her, cracks weird jokes and Claire retorts with her witty replies.➸ Lizzie:The ice queen of their group. A bit annoying but I love whoever loves Shannon.The hospital scene at the end is my roman empireand it was so adorable, so cute, so comforting. Just everything.“I’m keeping her, Da.”“Okay, son,” he coaxed. “You keep the girl.” “She makes my heart go, like, whoa.”“Is that right?” he mused.“So bad, Da.” I sighed. “Boom, boom, fucking boom.” I shook my head. “All the time.”The endingbroke my heart because Shannon didn\'t deserve that 😭, but I\'m hoping for a better life for her inKeeping 13.“If this is love, then it’s you,” he replied, dragging me down to lie beside him.“You are love.” He sighed contently. “Stay with me.” Always.“I’ll stay with you,” I whispered, feeling more in this moment than I could handle.💌 This is not just a story about a girl who was mentally and physically abused by her father and her classmates. It\'s not just about romance or friendships. It\'s about how to let someone in your life and how to develop your trust again and how to fall in love while also figuring out your fears and insecurities. It\'s about letting yourself move on from the life of difficulties and pain and trauma. It\'s about finding comfort, a home, a sense of security and love in other people. It\'s also about dreams and how to overcome your fear of losing them. It\'s about healing. It\'s just about life ❤️\u200d🩹——————————Definitely worth all the damn hype in this world!

The writing was so easy to read, it was very straight forward. After reading Nocticadia, the simplicity was exactly what I needed.The story felt very mindless from the beginning to middle of the book but it really picked up after that.This book is not perfect at all. Despite that I adore the characters and their relationships both familial and romantic.Shannon is my traumatised lovable sweet and smol pookie 😭I actually feel for her sfb. I just wanna give her a hug for 15373747 years it’s not fairrrrrr 💔The heartache from reading about her past and seeing how she suffered sm brought me to tears. I felt like jumping into the book and using all the tools in the universe to get retribution on everyone who hurt her istg- 🔪I can understand how her size and age being emphasised again and again could annoy anyone really but to me it just drills in the fact that all this was happening to a fifteen year old girl that should’ve been living her life normally. Her house, her home, the place she rests her head(!!) is supposed to allow her to de-stress and find some peace. What should’ve been her sanctuary was actually the most destructive place for her. Her small frame is directly linked to this as well. It’s really shitty to read about and I hate this for her (ಡ_ಡ)There wasn’t much of Shannon being carefree but she was adorable asf when she was in her element. Them playing GTA was the most I’ve seen her let go and gahhhh I loved every second of it 🤭💗🫂*Johnny is the most precious guy ever.What I love the most about him is that when he feels really solid about what he wants, he goes after it with his all. But what came out of his all or nothing attitude towards life hurttttttt ❤️\u200d🩹❤️\u200d🩹Him being indecisive about whether he wanted to pursue a relationship with Shannon was so valid. The reservations he’s kept and been reiterating in his head for years, about how his profession isn’t gonna leave any room for a relationship, that can’t just be broken down within seconds. It’s frustrating to read about sure but I understand the reason behind it.Watching him go from being calculated and orderly to berserk and punching her bullies had me going ferallll andjdhdj 💃It shows exactly how much she’s affected him and his life.Ugh I love him sfmmmm 🥹💗💗That hospital chapter was worth EVERYTHINGHHH 🤧✋ he made my heart go woah fr.He was actually so funny omfdssss. There were so many times he had me howling bc of his one liners 😭 he’s iconic, it’s true.Him being so adorableeeeee towards Shannon and the small moments between them had me shaking screaming dying. I love them together sfm it hurts.When he would thread his hand through her hair and ask for consent to hug her? ☝️. . . 💃🚂his affectionate touches? *sigh*HIM MAKING A PLAYLIST THAT REMINDS HIM OF HER?? 🤸🕳️Even the little things he would do like holding her bag or giving her his jacket?searching for her lost shoe in the rain???EVERYTHING.It all got to me. I’m obsessed.Gibsieeee my best boi.I absolutely adore the shit outta this guy. He’s my top man. The way he made me laffff so fucking loud at the most inopportune moments ugh chefs kiss. Especially when he was annoying Johnny abt his ~problems~ Omf I was wheezing. (He gives Seth vibes so hard I’m in loveeeee 🙏)Also the sum sum we’re getting with him and claire is not enough!!! I need moreee 😭Joey 😭😭 my heart goes out to him. This guy deserves to have everything in every universe.He’s the best brother. Him leaving Shannon there bc he couldn’t take it anymore killed me even tho I’m glad he put himself first (╥_╥)I wanna cry just thinking about the ending of this book 😭🔫The only thing I will say is that this book has a certain style of writing that doesn’t fit everyone. But personally I felt like there’s something really effective in Chloe’s writing that makes me connect to the characters and their situations.What bugged me most was the fact that there were a lot of scenes that I felt were kind of pointless idk. For example the denial scenes, Iykyk. There were too many of them. One or two is fine but EIGHT?! That could’ve been cut down. Especially bc those scenes would be so long and their conversations would not add anything big to the plot.Also there’s a difference between him denying his love for Shannon and him being indecisive over wanting a relationship with her. The former just annoyed me a lot.However, there were certain scenes which were used again and again but I felt they were necessary. For example, JohnnyShannon and their drives or Johnny taking care of Shannon however he can. It’s important for this to be shown more than once bc Shannon needs to feel that steady stability, that removal of doubts, which he’s giving her by repeating those reassuring words and actions. She needs to feel like he’s a constant in her life and that he’s reliable enough to be her safe haven.Even though there’s a long way for them to reach that level of trust, these scenes are basically the groundwork to get there. I love that we got to see most of these scenes fully playing out and not just being told he drove her home BAM end scene yk?There was ONE part which I would’ve died for and that was when he took her to the cinema 😭 it’s not fairrrr! Chloe release that scene from the vault I beg 🔪So basically this book made me laugh like a hyena (mostly gibsie’s fault), cringe quite a bit, hunt for a grave to temporarily lie in, sport the biggest grin, vibrate with anxiety, lose years off my life, develop wrinkles, and cry. Definitely the crying :). . .

""All the time.""🩷tbh.idek how to start this review. like I have so many feelings and I don’t know how to put them into coherent sentences. this book will make you feel every emotion there is to feel. maybe even new ones, you didn’t know you had. it feels real yk? it feels like these are two actual people I’ve read about bc the story is that fleshed out and detailed <33 they’re my roman empire FOREVER AND EVER!! ok let me stop babbling now and get into the review LMFAO💌 plot 💌I feel like most people know the plot of this book, but i’m gonna write it out anyways bc why not HAHAHA.shannon lynch has had a rough life.always picked on by the kids at school. shamed, teased, bullied. but she had it worseat home. the only girl amongst her 5 siblings and the easiest target for her father. any chance he gets, he will beat her to a pulp. after going through so much tormenting at school, her family decides to move her to tommen, ballylaggin’s most prestigious private school. that is where she meets the only boy that makes her feel safe. the love ofmyher life <33and he shows her what it’s really like to be cared for, and loved.🍓 shannon lynch 🍓🤎I once read somewhere that we mature with damage, not with age.🤎she broke my heart. SHE’S JUST A KID!! butshe basically raised 3 kids all on her own.she took care of sean, tahdg and ollie more than her mom ever did and it makes me SO MAD. all her mom did was cry for no reason whilst shewatched her kids get ABUSED and TORMENTED🙁a lot of people don’t like her too much bc she’s too stubborn or awkward but my god can you blame her? with that trauma, it’s impressive she can even trust anyone when she can’t feel safe around her own parents 💔💌I liked safe. In my world, invisibility equaled safety.I was happy to be wallpaper and blend in. 💌guys. she is literally my spirit animal. I know what it’s like to fear your own family. and it fucking sucks. being scared whenever they walk into a room, finding any possible excuse to leave the house, it’s genuinely horrible. when we are together, it always ends in me crying. there’s always something “imperfect” about me to comment on just so there’s a reason to yell. and that’s why I felt her to my core. she never did anything but she always suffered for absolutely no reason. just bc her dad felt like using a punching bag. like her, I don’t have a temper, I just sob, and sob, and sob.🧸 I was annoyed with myself for being the kind of person who cried when angry. I wanted to be a shouter. A shouter was much better than a crier. 🧸never did I want to jump into a book and give a character a hug as much as I did in this moment. shannon lynch, you are so strong <3🏉 johnny kavanagh 🏉ohmygod. I can’t even talk about him without squealing like a lovesick teenage girl (newsflash: I am a lovesick teenage girl). he makes me so giddy it’s actually fucking WEIRD. and then I remember he’s just words and I get depressed. ask my bsf, I will vent to her about him for hours like he’s an actual PERSON.the most greenest forest in the universe.in a world of gross filthy boys, he is a gentleman and everything more 🥹 he cared for shannon in a way I’ve never seen with any other man. he was masculine and attractive, but without that toxicity and gross ego they usually have. he made her FEEL SAFE, when she thought she couldn’t with anyone else in the world. I love him I love him I love him I love him I love him I love him I love him I love him I love him.anyways.I love him. did I mention that? I don’t think I did.🎀I can take you home when you have to go? What the actual fuck?

Which might sound strange as it covers some heavy themes.For me it comes down to how genuine everything in this book is.It feels like life; real, a bit heartbreaking at times and the best when surrounded with people you love.✦“He added fresh bruises to old bruises.”✦This is a brutally honest depiction of that time between adulthood and childhood, of teenage love and friendships, not sugar-coating issues within families but also showing the strength that can be found there.Binding 13 is unique in the sense that the friendships and sibling relationships in this arejustas good as the romance. At times I even loved Joey & Shannon's relationship more.Going into this I was a bit worried I wasn't gonna be able to connect to the characters as they are very young, and I usually prefer reading books with characters closer to my own age.That fear was quickly demolished. The writing is incredibly immersive.It was effortless to fall into this, feeling the struggles of being a teen stuck in difficult situations whilst also handling things such as crushes, grades and finding yourself.✧“Shannon Lynch was the greatest weapon of mass destruction my heart has ever been exposed to.”✧It's not fair to write a review on this book and not write about the romance. It's so clear to see that they are made for each other and you cannot help yourself from rooting for them from early on.It's that innocent type of teenage love that comes with butterflies and overthinking, but it still has such depth.Their mutual shy crushes made me feel all giddy as if I was the one with a crush. If someone dedicated She Will Be Loved to me, I would marry them on the spot. 😭✧“My heart. My poor, poor heart. I didn’t stand a chance with this boy.”✧The friendships in this has a dedicated place close to my heart. Gibsie and Johnny, Shannon, Lizzie and Claire. Not to be repetitive, but what I love about it is that it's so sincere and feels so real.Them being there for each other, knowing each other inside and out, relentless teasing and inside jokes, and just simply being comfortable in each other's company. This combined with the early 00's vibes gave off such an amazing ambiance throughout the book. (Being real for a second though, home-burned mix CD's is such a lost art. Spotify playlists just don't hit the same.🤧)Although the length of the book intimidated me initially, the pacing was perfect and had no real downtime which is very impressive for a book of over 800 pages. It went by much faster than I anticipated and I am extremely eager to continue this series going forward.______⌞pre-read:⌝I didn't think I would read this because I don't really get sports lol, but SK convinced me to give it a try. 🫶It's a bit intimidating going into this knowing how much people love it.

Thank you :)Before you proceed, I would like for you to understand that the followingrantreview contains a lot of swearing, incoherent rambling, and capitalized yelling. Reader discretion is advised.--lol that was fun, but now:Seriously, one thing I absolutely hate, no matter what genre I\'m reading istellinginstead ofshowing. This had SO MUCH of telling, SO MUCH - LIKE PAGES WORTH OF - inner dialogue and FOR WHAT?! The book was written in dual pov, so for most of the book I just had to see them both mentally waxing poetry about how good the other person looks. AND THERE WAS SM BELLA CONTENT? Like fuck her, why did I have to read SO much about her, I really don\'t understand. And all the scenes she was in wereliterally the sameIn Johnny\'s case - he only started to grow on me in the chapter where he was out of his senses and didn\'t know what he was saying.Thatis when I liked him most. We\'retoldhe\'s extremely picky when it comes to the girls he surrounds himself with, while in reality, his last fuck-buddy is an obsessive stardom-crazy bitch, and the girl he ""falls"" for is a girl with ""lonesome"" eyes and a dysfunctional family.I SWEAR TO GOD, THAT MAN HAS A LONER SAD GIRL KINK. Every time he had to describe her, he would mention how she was lonesome, fragile, uncertain - like yeah, makes you believe he absolutely loves the girl, doesn\'t it? 🙃We\'retoldthat he sticks to his routine, nothing in his life is more important than rugby, and he will not lose sight of what is important to him. In his pov, during the never-ending inner monologue, he goes on and on about how he\'s not one of those guys who waste their time on drinking and pussies. No, he has more important shit to do. In reality, he ignores his training for Shannon, goes out to drink with Gibs whenever invited, gets multiple hard-ons for Shannon, and cannot stop seeking her out everywhere after only meeting heronce. Yup, what a focused man.We\'re also told ample times that he hates lies when in reality, he tells multiple lies himself. Love me a hypocrite <3But I can ignore all this. What got to me most was his indecisiveness, and hot and cold behavior. He will think about how beautiful she is obsessively. He\'ll think about how much he likes her. He\'ll drop the l-bombs too - which they both do, as and when they wish, and then go back to the ""i don\'t even know you / we\'re friends"" bs - will give her multiple hints that he likes her because he\'ll always protect her whenever she\'s in trouble, go out of his way to give her multiple lifts home, share secrets about his injuries etc and then always center back to ""I cannot afford to do this,"" ""my career is on the line,"" ""i will go away so it\'ll only end up with both of us being hurt"" - and this repeated for like 800 pages, LIKE FOR FUCKS SAKE PICK A SIDE!The thing I liked about him though was how he always stood up Shannon, didn\'t get under anybody\'s influence, took good decisions even while drunk, and had a very cute dog. His morphine episode really made him extremely adorable and fun to read about, but we came back to good ol\' johnny when he woke up from his drug-induced coma. ALSO, HEART EYES FOR HIS PARENTS!2018 me would\'ve been on her knees for him though, given how protective he was.maybe i don\'t like him much bec the guy saves and protects the girl ALWAYS is not something i particularly enjoy reading now and that was what happened throughout the book.Moving on toShannon,i\'m going to try my best to get this across without coming across as a heartless bitch - I did not care about her. Yes, I felt bad about her situation. Yes, I wanted her to get out of her fucked up home. Yes, I disliked her parents. But her as a character, outside of that, fell super flat for me. I just don\'t understand how there was no character development in her when the book was 800+ pages long. Like somebody please explain it to me. Multiple times the abuse also felt like a plot device to me, because it was only shown on two occasions. One where her father finds the newspaper article and at the end. The last chapter left an impact on me, but I wished it had happened sooner, yk? Because throughout the book, most of the time, it\'s just Johnny noticing all her bruises, and then questioning her about them. Her anxiety after being bullied relentlessly was justified, but I like to see my characters try and fight that, instead of settling into that. Also, I get that not every fmc has to be a badass but I would\'ve liked seeing her mental battles, her tending to her bruises, her thinking about what she\'s been through, and how she could fight for herself. And I got none of that.I like good slow burns as much as the next person, but there was absolutely no burn here for the major part of the book. I really was rooting for my babies Gibs and Claire more than the main couple. I\'m salty about how little we got to see them, I NEED MORE! Everybody should have a best friend like Gibs, he was the highlight of the book for me. I absolutely love himhe even let that pedophile bitch suck his dick to get Shannon\'s file that johnny wanted, like 😭But for shannon and johnny, they went from 0 to 100 real quick, and went back to 0 even faster. Their whole dynamic was equal parts confusing and frustrating to me, and again, they justtoldus that they love the other person, but we never got to seehowdid that happen, or when did that happen. Like there was no flow to it. he just likes that she\'s not like other girls and she likes that he\'s hot and cares for her 😭😭I was also living for the Aoife crumbs we got, I already love her!The last chapter of this book was literally the most impactful one for me, and only for that is this book getting 3 stars.

For example: plot happens in chapter 3...chapters 4 and 5 revolve around Shannon and Johnny relaying said plot in chapter 3 to their friends. NOTHING HAPPENS. It's like 1 step forward and two steps in place. I can literally skip entire chapters and still get the gist of what happens. By like the 40% point, the two main characters have had hardly any interaction- but I know all of the antics of their friends really well! Gibsie is hilarious! Lizzie is a drag. That Rowen character sucks. Gibsie and Claire sooo belong together and are blind to it (I sense the build up to their own book)...etc. The book mostly revolves around Shannon's shitty home life and school life, Johnny's sports and their friends. Which is all fine...except its more about all of those things than a romance. And it doesn't help that so much of the plot is repeated every other chapter.-There is slow burn romance....and then there is so slow, they literally go backwards- romance. The main characters have maybe 5/6 worthwhile scenes together and I am at the 72% mark. They talk the day Johnny hit Shannon in the head with a ball, they talk maybe once at lunch, they talk when she is forced to go over to his house twice, they have one meaningful conversation in his car and they go to a pub together. But most of their conversations revolve around him trying to figure out what the marks on her body are from, and kicking the asses of those who threaten her. They have kissed once (one sided mind you), talked a handful of times, yet they both feel like they are in love with the other. HOW?-I get Shannon is a wounded bird- but MAN her actions are frustrating to read. She's just SO meek and the ultimate damsel that needs saving.Everythingbad that could happen to her, happens to her. It's just a lot. And I get that she has had a hard life, but sometimes I just really wanted her to stand up and become a strong person despite all of that.-Although I am giving this a one star out of pure frustration with the plot-I do have to say that the dialogue is this book is fantastic and it is pretty well written in general.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '➼5★”Hi Johnny.”“Hi Shannon.”Hey Siri play “You are in love” (Taylor’s version)“One night, he wakesStrange look on his facePauses, he says‘Your my best friend’And you knew what it wasHe is in love”Welcome back to a brand-new review! I’m so excited to tell you about this book because I loved it so so much. First of all, I have to point out that you don’t have to be scared by the length of the book because—even tho it has almost 800 pages—the writing is captivating, and you don’t get bored. Holy mother of God I was so invested in these teenager dramas, it’s embarrassing…👀About the plot:This book tells the story of Johnny—a 17-year-old popular boy whose life turns around rugby and nothing else: no girl, no injury, no friend, no one can interfere in his dream, not even his parents. But something is about to change when he meets Shannon—a little girl, too young, too fragile, too damaged for him, but nothing is going to stop them to fall for each other.My thoughts (spoilers ahead):As I’ve already said, I fell in love with this book, even tho the story is abouttwo teenagerswho fall in love with each other. It’s very long but nothing stopped me to read 100 and more pages per day and I loved every single page of it. The story is captivating, a lot happens, and this makes you so invested that you can’t stop reading it. The writing is simple and since the author is Irish, she put aglossaryand thepronunciationof names you’ll find within. So don’t worry if you don’t understand or you don’t know some words, the glossary has them all, which I appreciate a lot since English—let alone Irish— is not my first language.I laughed, I cried, I got mad, and I felt pain but it was all worth it. Be ready because it\'s a journey...!!TW!! If you’re sensible to violence, please skip this part.Shannon: I need to present her a little before telling you what I think aboutShannon like the river. So, she is a 15-year-old girl, who lives with her parents and brothers. Joey—her older brother—is her anchor and I really appreciated the bond between them; they were fond of and protected each other. Shannon hasn’t an easy life: she’s been bullied since she started going to school by her classmates and she’s also been beaten up by her own father, who was an alcoholic. The situation got too far that her mother decided to make her change school by going to a private one, even tho the family wasn’t rich. This is where she met Johnny. On her first day of school he knocked her off during rugby, but he took really good care of her. From that moment, they were inseparable. Johnny took every chance he got to spend time with her, and soon they started falling for each other.Shannon is a very fragile person, with a lot of traumas caused by people in school and her own parents. She’s been through a lot and I wanted to hug her during the entire book. I’m so glad she found Johnny because she deserves happiness, but mostly she deserves to feel safe around people which is something we take for granted—at least most of us— because we feel safe in our home and we should feel safe. I know that’s not something every family has the privilege to experience, and it makes my heart break. I felt the pain Shannon felt, as well as the moment of happiness, sadness and fear she passed through. I had the need to protect her and I can easily understand why Johnny felt that too. The end made me cry my eyes out and my heart broke in thousands of pieces. I hope that in the second book she’ll have her safety feeling she desperately needs.“Family line”by Conan Gray reminds me of her.Johnny: I loved him so so much. Even tho he’s only 17, he’s very mature. He’s a really good guy, thoughtful, loyal to his promises, brave and kind. He def has an easy life: he has the money, the status, the rugby, a loving family, girls, good grades...He was very fond of Shannon tho, since the first day he met her, he didn’t even hesitate to step in and help her when she most needed someone to take care of her. He didn\'t judge her. Never. He also was very respectful with women and girls, not only with Shannon. As I said before, his life turns around rugby. That is his dream. However, he got injured and he had to have a delicate surgery. He was struggling because of pain but it didn’t stop him to chase his dream. I really admire his strength and his courage, tho I think he put himself in a very dangerous position.He\'s the sweetest guy without being too much. I have really few things to complain about: 1) the fact that it took too much time for him to realize his love for Shannon. Like dude wake the hell up!!! 2) He kept complaining about her age when he was literally 17 and she was 15—and in the middle of the book she turns 16, soooooo… I don’t find the age gap a big deal, I bet everyone in high school had a crush or dated someone older by 2 years or so. Again, not a big deal. But he kept saying that it was—in fact– a big problem. Eventually he got over this bullshit, thank Lord. 3) he didn’t kiss her back the first time she kissed him…Anyway, EVERYONE LISTEN CAREFULLY: HE HAD A PLAYLIST ON HIS IPOD FULL OF LOVE SONGS WITH HER NAME!!!!!!! He made her a freaking playlist with love songs. Like, if someone makes me a playlist with love songs is over for me, I fall in love immediately.Their relationship: I freaking loved every second of it. The most beautiful thing was that they were friends before being lovers. They supported each other, they wanted to spend every second together, she felt safe with him, and he protected her always. I loved the little things happened between them, like hands touching and so on.Also, the end was so touching. The fact that he kept telling his parents that she was the one… AHHHH!!! Just perfect. Really.Do I recommend this book? Absolutely YES.If you like teenager dramas and cute love stories, this book is for you but be careful and read the TWs first!Some quotes:“""Because you\'re beautiful,"" […]A boy had never called me beautiful before.Not like this.Not with such forwardness.Not with such sincerity.Johnny said it, though, and my heart was flapping around in my chest like a demented, caged bird, fighting to escape.[…]“Inside and out”[…]""Everywhere.””“If feelings were objects, then I was teetering on the edge of a great precipice, and if girls were weapons, then Shannon Lynch was the greatest weapon of mass destruction my heart had ever been exposed to.”“But I already felt like I was drowning with her.That\'s how consumed I was in this girl.That\'s how much I loved her.”“""She makes my heart go, like, whoa.""""So bad, Da,"" I sighed. ""Boom, boom, fucking boom."" I shook my head. ""All the time.""[…]And then I heard those two words.""Hi, Johnny.""""Boom, boom, fucking boom. Da,"" I groaned, slapping a hand against my chest ""I\'m done for.""”“And those fucking midnight blue eyes - which I didn\'t think was a good enough word to describe the color.They should have been called soul blue because they were deep as fuck and sucked a person right in…”“Instead, I nestled my cheek against his side and closed my eyes, allowing myself to drift off to sleep without an ounce of fear in my heart because it couldn\'t exist inside of me, not when this boy had his arm around me.”01/08:rereading bc i miss my babies🙂\u200d↕️'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I am not exaggerating.

I knew it was a sports book, but I thought it would be the typical cute story, with just a little bit of teen drama and that\'s it. BUT NO. I\'d even say that rugby takes a backseat (for me at least) at one point.I don\'t like to mince my words and thoughts when I talk about a book, especially one I liked, soI might give away a couple of spoilers, if you haven\'t read the book and plan to... it\'s up to you to read the rest of my review.🌠🏉🏅⋆.ೃ࿔*:･₊•.°.⋆✮⋆.°.•₊⋆.ೃ࿔*:･🌠🏉🏅⋆.ೃ࿔*:･₊•.°.⋆✮⋆.°.•₊⋆.ೃ࿔*:･🏅🏉🌠Reading this broke me to pieces, I was sad, a little happy, a little relieved... and then sad again, and angry.𓍯𓂃Shannon:for a fmc she\'s not my fav, but maybe that\'s just a personal preference. I usually prefer stronger fmc\'s, with more personality. Even so, it\'s obvious that she\'s going through a VERY difficult situation of abuse, both at home and at school, and it\'s something that\'s been slowly accumulating for years, so I understand why her personality is more fragile and why she\'s so easily intimidated by others.It was very hard to read the scenes in which she was about to get in her house bc i could also feel her anxiety, not knowing if it was going to be an ok day or if she had to start thinking of how to cover the bruises and make up stories for the next day.Biological family is that part of life that you cannot choose, you\'re either born in a good loving caring supportive family or you don\'t. So reading her longing for a happy place, a safe place, it was very heart wrenching and i just want her to find the happiness and peace she deserves.“For once in my life, I wanted a safe place to run to instead of from.I felt like I was slowly dying in that house.In my home.Where I was supposed to lay my head.Where I was supposed to feel safe.”𓍯𓂃Johnny:now... i never thought than a man called johnny would make me feel like this, but here we are. I\'m always DOWN for a man who is determined, has his goals clear, looks like he wants to kill everyone but is willing to go all the way and beyond to protect you and keep you safe. And Johnny is all that and more. He\'s tough and ready to fight anyone who gets in his way, but as soon as he senses that Shannon is in trouble (which happens every 2 secs), he\'s right there ready to take matters into his own hands... andI\'m weak, what can I say?Regarding his ambition to pursue a rugby career, it was honestly so impressive bc from the start you realize how big of a deal it is for him, that\'s what he has always wanted and worked for, to the point that he\'s been compromising his own health for it because he doesn\'t think he\'s anyone without rugby.And at the same time he\'s starting to realize that for the outside people rugby is his whole identity and there\'s no world in which he can be considered an individual asides from it, so it\'s very important for him, once he meets shannon, that she seems to be one of the few people who think about him just as johnny the teenager, not the rugby player.“I wanted to fight all her battles. I wanted to give her all her smiles and make her laugh and snatch her away from the rest of the world and keep her all to myself. I just wanted her. For keeps.”𓍯𓂃Claire and Gibsie:they were both very cute, I loved reading their banter and how it is CLEAR as daylight that they both love each other, so I can only imagine how their relationship will go on their own book (if the author doesn\'t mess it up). They were always so so so supportive of their friends, especially Gibs, I found him to be like the BEST wingman and ""sidekick"" lol, he was always a call or txt away from showing up and helping Johnny in whatever he was needing.𓍯𓂃Joey:my baby... ughhhhh!!! i just KNOW that he has suffered SO SO SO much, having to step up and basically grow up prematurely and raise his siblings as if they were his own.. i\'m sure we don\'t know the EXTENT of his trauma yet and as an older sibling myself, who\'s always looking out for the younger ones (darren doesn\'t count to me idc), it breaks me just imagining his suffering.𓍯𓂃abusive violent w anger-issues dad and stupid negligent mom:sigh...honestly what can i say about them? Their dad is a BULLY, a beater, a sexist, cruel and vicious man, there\'s nothing remotely redeemable about him bc sometimes evil people are just that... evil. no explanation or backstory needed on why they are the way they are. Their mom though... that\'s a whole different story, and I KNOW at some extent she\'s a victim too, but i couldn\'t care less about her. She makes me so mad, it\'s infuriating just having to read the pages she\'s in bc i know i\'m about to read the most stupid woman on fictional land. I honestly don\'t know how you see your kids being BEATEN, mistreated physically and verbally for YEARS and do nothing but stay around pretending nothing happens... like, you\'re the adult in that situation, do something please!! she\'s an enabler and i dont think i\'ll ever feel bad for her.🌠🏉🏅⋆.ೃ࿔*:･₊•.°.⋆✮⋆.°.•₊⋆.ೃ࿔*:･🌠🏉🏅⋆.ೃ࿔*:･₊•.°.⋆✮⋆.°.•₊⋆.ೃ࿔*:･🏅🏉🌠——⭑⋆⋆⋆⭑——Plot♡\u2060——⭑⋆⋆⋆⭑——I MOSTLY enjoyed this book, it was nothing like I was expecting, and that\'s something I like and appreciate, but at the beginning i was a little bit thrown off knowing that our mc were 15-17 bc i\'m older and idk.. i guess i\'m not used to read from THAT young perspective anymore but i got to forget about it quickly.There were some moments, especially with Shannon, in which i was cringing so bad lol, bc she was borderline clumsy, for no good reason, just to make her seem all so quirky and helpless. And sometimes her attitude was so chidlish but again... she\'s only 15-16 so.. it makes sense and i guess i was cringey too at that age lol.Overall, i ENJOYED a lot of this book, but i felt it too unserious at times and there were a lot of parts that the author dragged unnecessarily and that could have been shorter without affecting the plot. I think this book could have used like 200 pages less and it would still be as good.I still think this is worth the try and for those who feel intimidated by the amount of pages it really flies by bc the writing is very easy to follow and the story keeps you locked in, so.. that\'s it.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""“I once read somewhere that we mature with damage, not with age.” -`♡´-“¨I think I need you for keeps.¨¨I think I need you for keeps, too.¨” -`♡´-“Now, tell me who made you cry and I'll fix it.”-`♡´-3 Stars-I'm undecided on this rating a little bit so I may change it again but I'm going with 3 for now.So let me start with- I was under the impression that this was a YA sports romance initially. I understood that there was family drama and physical abuse the the FMC was experiencing at home but I've read YA that includes heavy topics and this ...where on earth did I get YA from???Fair warning - this is definitely not a YA story and even though I've read plenty of books with violence in them, some of the abuse scenes in this even had me an adult drawing back in horror.I adore Johnny,he is the epitome of a lovable and protective love interest. The way he treated Shannon right from the beginning was so heartwarming and really had the emotions in me stirring.Add the horrible things that Shannon is going through at home with her alcoholic and abusive father along with her dipshit of a mother who is such a weak woman that she basically turns her head to the physical and emotional abuse being inflicted on all of her children -it makes for a compelling plot.╰┈➤Where my issues with the book come in- is in the writing and storytelling itself.I really had to look past quite a lot of things. I know I've said it many times in my updates, but trust me - it's no where near the amount of times it's mentioned in the book.╰┈➤Shannon is tiny. She's SMOL. She's petite. She's pint sized.

I've never felt like the size of a toddler - lmao.But for real.Not only that but the amount of clumsiness and things that happen really just made her seem even younger than she was made me feel a little uncomfortable. In a way that she seemed childlike?╰┈➤The whole 'pitching a tent' scene.I really had second hand embarrassment and some of the ick with the way things went down with them in that scene.Overall, I did enjoy the story itself and it did evoke emotions out of me.

The Silent Patient
",Alex Michaelides,4.18,2590881,10919,"Thriller, Mystery, Fiction, Mystery Thriller, Suspense, Crime, Psychological Thriller",336,05-02-2019,"Alicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect. A famous painter married to an in-demand fashion photographer, she lives in a grand house with big windows overlooking a park in one of London’s most desirable areas. One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word.Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The price of her art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and spotlight at the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London.Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a twisting path into his own motivations—a search for the truth that threatens to consume him....The Silent Patientis a shocking psychological thriller of a woman’s act of violence against her husband—and of the therapist obsessed with uncovering her motive.","[{'rating': 1, 'content': '| |blog|tumblr|ko-fi| |“Please don’t let’s get dramatic.”I\'ve been a bithesitantabout writing this review since the majority of readers really enjoyed this debut. Howeversince Goodreads allows us toexpressandrespectour different opinions I don\'t see any harm in being honest.I didn\'t hateThe Silent Patientbut I did find thisnovelboth ridiculous and incompetent.Just becauseThe Silent Patienthas a ""twist"" that doesn\'t mean it should be labelled as being a psychological thriller. There is little to no suspense, the mystery is laughable, the tension largely MIA. Thepsychologyin this one is...well,the depiction of psychiatrist and psychotherapists is at best, laughable, at worst, ignorant.The book hinges completely on its ""twist"", a twist thatalso renders the majority of the narrativecompletely irrelevant.This book seems to meyet anotherweak attempt of jumping on the domestic thriller bandwagon.In short:Calling this a novel seems somewhat misleading. This reads more like some sort ofhackneyedscript.LONG REVIEW AHEAD (if you enjoyed this book I advise you to skip this rant-review)The Silent Patientis a really flawed piece of work. I will try to tackle what I personally thought were the major problems this book had (and yes, this is my subjective opinion):✎THE WRITING(idiotic dialogues + inane monologues + ham-handed metamorphoses + a complete lack of a sense of place)✖ I likeAgatha Christieand she has what I would call a \'dry\' style of writing. Her mysteries are heavy on dialogue. The many conversations that her characters have are witty, amusing and or entertaining. The descriptions she provides perfectly render the characters\' mannerisms and surroundings.Michaelides\' writing mostly consisted in a series of dialogues between two characters and itreads like a script. It would work if what they spoke like actual peoplerather than this:“Perhaps I’m imagining it.But I’m sensing something… Keep an eye on it. Any aggression or competitiveness interferes with the work.You two need to work with each other, not against each other.”“But remember, with greater feeling comes greater danger.”The dialogues/monologuescame across as being incredibly silly and they make the characters sound like children.✖ There wereplenty of dramatic and over-the-top statements and or phrases that really ruinedpotentiallysignificant scenesand or somber moments of contemplation:“Her silence was like a mirror—reflecting yourself back at you.”~“Now I saw the truth.[She] hadn’t saved me—she wasn’t capable of saving anyone. She was no heroine to be admired—just a frightened, fucked-up girl, a cheating liar. This whole mythology ofusthat I had built up […] now collapsed in seconds—like a house of cards in a gust of wind.”~“How was this possible?Had she been acting the whole time? Had she ever loved me?”~“Why did she do it? How could she?”Jeez, melodramatic much?✖ Theo’s narrative was filled withpainfully overdone monologuesthat have little purpose since they don’t make Theo into a realistic and nuanced character and most of the time they do not even further the plot. Alicia’s narrative (that is, her diary) makes no sense but more on that when I tackle her character. It’s safe to say that, given that her diary entries included things such as “It took me a moment to speak. I was so taken aback I didn’t know what to say” and “I feel joyous. I feel full of hope”, I had a hard time ‘immersing’ myself or ‘buying’ into her narrative.Since this book is a ‘domestic thriller’ both Theo and Alicia don’t have sex they ‘fuck’. Because writing ‘we fucked’ makes the story gritty and ‘dark’ [insert laughter here].✖The Greek ‘connection’.Done properly, I usually love it when contemporary books draw parallels from Greek myths and or classics.Done properly.Comparing people to Greek statues and having your main characters referring to themselves as being a ‘Greek hero/heroine’ is the opposite of subtle:“She was a statue; a Greek goddess come to life in my hands.” ~ “He looked like a Greek statue” ~ “the actress playing Alcestis looked like a Greek statue” ~ “my fate was already decided—like in a Greek tragedy” ~ “Casting herself as a tragic heroine”.We have Diomedes who comes from “a long line of Greek shepherds” (and tells Theo that “every Greek knows his tragedies”). And finally we have Alicia’s painting which is entitled Alcestis.Both the painting and Euripides play hadpotential. They would have been enough.We didn’t need the constant reminder thatThe Silent Patientwants to be a ‘tragic play’. Like many other things in this book,the blatant symbolism managed to ruin a potentially good analogy.✖ These characters donotsound British.They talk like Americans(or what Americans sound like in a CSI episode). There are no British cultural references and or British expressions. This book could be set anywhere.✖ The story is set supposedly in the UK. But really, there is 0 sense of place. Who cares about giving your characters a backdrop? Why bother rendering a neighbourhood or an area of London? Who gives a fork about what a room or place looks like? Let\'s remember: this story could be set anywhere (ornowheregiven how realistic it is).✖ You could say that thefocus on dialogues and flat scenery are reminiscent of a play...which is fine but it doesn’t come across as such.This book just reminds me of a ‘B-movie’ script.There is no tragedy, no pathos , no wit.A 2nd grade play is closer to a \'classic\' play than this book is.✖There is this attempt to make the two ‘main’ women ethereal which did provides a few laughs:“Her white dress glowed ghostlike in the torchlight” ~ “I remember so much white everywhere: […] the white of her eyes, her teeth, her skin. I’d never known that skin could be so luminous, so translucent ; ivory white with occasional blue veins visible just beneath the surface, like threads of color in white marble. She was a statue.” ~ “strands of long red hair falling across bony shoulders, blue veins beneath the translucent skin”.✎THE CHARACTERS✖ Theo. Our wannabeTom Ripley. Within a few pages we know that he is obsessed with Alicia (which makes him incredibly unprofessional) and he for the most part he is justsoooodull and whiny. He moans about his childhood,and his wife, Kathy, who is cheating on him because she is a beautiful actress so...that\'s what they do, isn\'t it?, andhis attempt(s) to self-fashion himself as some sort of tragic hero fail epically. Afterthe big reveal...well. His character makes even less forking sense. He stalked Alicia before breaking into her house. He must have known learnt about her, or made same 2+2 type of reasoning upon learning of her arrest. And he must have realised why she kept silent, especially after he reads Alcestis.This guy issoooothick.Hisdramatic monologues, constant whinging, and complete lack of awareness(I\'ve said it before this man is thick) made him into a really unbelievable character.✖Alicia...she is beautiful.She loves having sex with her husband and painting. That’s about it. We are told that she was ‘charming’...buthow can she have gained this reputation since she has 0 friendsand her only real relationship is the one she has with Gabriel (her partner or whatever). Jean-Felix is the owner of a gallery but they don’t spend time together or are on friendly terms.Who is she charming to?She is a complete recluse! She lives in London and is good enough painter and yet...she has managed to make 0 connections.Her diary entries make her sound at best guileless and at worst like adementedchild. Her character is just an object.She is there to look beautiful and tragic.She has a fewbasic reactions(she just “looks up” or “looks down”) or she doesthe good ol’ ‘banshee’ act, flinging herself in a sudden ‘rage’ towards Theo or another patient. Wow. Such a deep and complex portrait of abetrayed and traumatised woman.✖The cast of characters consists in cardboard cutouts. Going back to Christie, sometimes exaggerated character can be entertaining. Especially if they are a parodying a certain type of person (the writer, the artist, the gossipy old lady and so forth). Here we have mere ‘sketches’ of people.We have Christian, who doesn’t like Theo because he is amassive bellendbully: “Christian glared at me.” “Christian looked irritated.” “Christian rolled his eyes at me.” “Christian laughed that annoying laugh of his.”We haveProfessor Diomedes who is Greek and is “an unorthodox man’...that’s it folks. That’s his character. Also,I cannot seriously believe that he was so unprofessional and blind about Theo (and his flagrant obsession with Alicia).Yuri is another pointless and unbelievable addition to the story.He is the head psychiatric nurse and comes from Latvia so heobviouslyhas to be weird about women.Makes perfect sense. Then we have Stephanie who has very little page time or importanceTheo having never even know of her existence knows immediately, before she even speaks, that she is Caribbean). We also have the “jolly Caribbean dinner ladies” (who,surprise surprise, are only mentionedonce).We have a few‘ugly’characters who are either ‘mad’ and or violent(Elif, a ‘massive’ Turkish woman, who spends her time shouting or grunting because she is a patient and that’s how ‘ugly’ and mentally ill people behave.Lydia, Alicia’s mean aunt. She is grotesquely ‘fat’ and has lots of cats. She basically just glares, scorns, and spits at people). Paul, Alicia’s cousin, still lives with his mother so he looks like ‘virgin’ and in spite his size he seems ‘stunted’. Kathy and Gabriel arethe antithesis of credible(actors and fashion photographers manage to be self-engrossed and 1 dimensional). We have Gabriel’s brother...who is the typical chip-on-my-shoulder character (he has acne, he is balding, he is just a ‘lawyer’,boohoo). Jean-Felix owns a gallery so he is the embodiment ofsome sort of art-vampire.✎THE NONSENSICAL PLOT✖ Nothing much happens. It’s quite clear thatthe words that exist before the ‘twist’ serve as filler. Theo moans about this and that. That\'s about 70% of the novel.✖ There area series of stupid thingshappening forno apparent reason.such as Paul hitting Theo with a bat. WHY.✖ The Grove is not a forensic unit. I am sure that Theo should be doing a bit of paperwork to cover his 1 to 1s with Alicia. And everything thathappens in the Grove is extremely unlikely. Rules, guidelines, procedures are flung out of the window.✖ The ‘big twist’is predictable.We know Theo is unreliable.All of his actions towards Alicia, his research and his ‘interviews’ makeno bloody sense. He already knows about her! And unlesshe is incredibly thick, he should do 2+2 and figure out why she isn’t talking. The twist makes his motivations and approach to Alicia completely pointless. Theo hadn’t forgotten what he’d done, and his narrative isn’t in the format of a diary, where he would be deliberately lying and omitting certain things. Why not make this novel into more of a confessional? Or more in the vein ofThe Talented Mr. Ripley,You,Lolita, or evenGentlemen and Players, where we know early on what he has done and we wonder if he will be caught or if he will done something worse.IN CONCLUSIONThe Silent Patientmight notbe the worst novel I’ve read but it’sa badly written, poorly developed book. Worse still,The Silent Patientcomes across as being both pointless and passionless.A ‘twist’ needs—demands—a story. I want to read characters who vaguely resemble or talk like real people. If you want to play with stereotypes (a la Christie) don\'t make yourcharacters take themselves so seriously.A parody of a certain \'personality\' should at least be funny and or amusing.Adding a strong setting and a coherent storyline wouldn’t do any harm either.Overall:The Silent Patientis a messy, flat, painfully dull, \'Hollywood-type\' of book.Read more reviews on my blogIf you likedVerity,An Anonymous Girl,The Last Time I Liedor the unintentionally hilariousJane Doe...chances are you will likeThe Silent Patient.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'This book starts off really strong with a great premise - intriguing and mysterious right away - the writing is even pretty strong in the beginning, but somewhere along the way it all seemed to fall apart for me. I felt like the author was so determined to deliver the big ‘twist’ that he lost sight of the actual plot. It just gets so convoluted and meandering, and I couldn’t really follow what actually happened, from what was meant to be the lies and fantasy of some characters. The author also spends an awful lot of the book having the main character, Theo, ‘investigate’ Alicia’s family members - the cousin, the aunt, the brother in law, her gallery manager - and each of them is made to seem weird, untrustworthy and in some cases outright creepy - but all of it ends up just feeling like a cheap trick, because nothing comes of any of them. Like, for example, the plot about the brother in law assaulting her, or the cousin borrowing money, - none of those things are resolved and it just feels like a lazy way for the author to point our suspicions in the wrong direction while leaving frustrating loose ends everywhere. I mean, you can make any character seem suspicious and create false suspense very easily if you have no obligation to deliver any resolutions.In the author’s single quest to deliver the big ‘twist’ he also left big holes in the plot and expected us to overlook implausible things... like, one small but obvious thing - at the start of the book Theo’s belongings are searched by ‘security’ before entering the hospital and he is specifically told he can’t have any lighters for “obvious reasons” - can’t have any of the psychiatric patients getting their hands on a way to start fires - (now the author didn’t need to mention this in the story - he could have lost this scene and not drawn attention to the fact that Theo was not allowed to bring in a lighter - not sure why it was even a point??) but then through out the book the characters smoke cigars and cigarettes in the hospital ... how do they light them?? They all carry matches I assume? Are matches any less likely to start a fire??! There were SO MANY eye-rolling moments through out the book like that one, and far worse. So many times we, as readers, were expected to buy into implausible actions by characters (like Alicia’s cousin beating Theo over the head with a baseball bat and knocking him out because he thought he was an intruder (in his yard - not even his house!), and then not to mention Theo feeling fine and not needing any medical attention??) or just overlook unbelievable scenarios - like Theo following his wife’s lover for miles and never once actually seeing his face?? When the police investigate the scene of Alicia’s husband’s death, how do they not find the rope and wire that was used to tie up Alicia? And Who has enough rope and wire just lying around in their house to tie up two adults anyway?! And another doozy - Theo injects Alicia with enough morphine to put her in a coma for the rest of her life, but she has time to find a pen and diary and write a very lucid, long entry explaining Theo’s role in everything?! Besides the fact that she would be completely out of it and totally incapable of writing, even if she could, why wouldn’t she, I don’t know, go get help because you’ve just been injected with a lethal dose of morphine, instead of writing a short story??! And then with a lethal amount of morphine coursing through her blood stream she takes the time to hide her diary in a picture frame?! Seriously?! It’s almost funny.And what about Alicia’s silence?? The mystery at the heart of the book - in the very title itself. The big reveal, the big answer shrouded in suspense and mystery .... the reason she didn’t talk was because she felt she had nothing to say??? Because she felt like she was dead too?? Wait... what? Seriously? She’s been accused of murdering her husband, while the man who stalks her, breaks in to her home, ties her up and threatens to kill her later shows up as her therapist, while she allows her other therapist to continue drugging her with “horse dosage” amounts of sedatives - but oh well, silence for years and years because she felt dead and had nothing to say?? And she stays silent mind you, while she still manages to hide her diary?!? We can only assume she goes to extreme measures to keep the police from ever finding it? Even though they walk in right after the murder while she’s still holding the smoking gun - I guess they gave her time to gather her things and somehow hide a diary down her pants while she was brought to prison?? Not to mention how no one found it when she was transferred to the mental hospital?! Why go to so much trouble to hide a diary if you feel like you’re dead and you have nothing to say!?Giant eye roll.I’m sorry - this book just asks too much of the reader - this ‘twist’ has been done many times before and it only works (and still very poorly) if you overlook all the giant plot holes and ridiculous scenarios.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""This is easily one of the best mystery/thrillers, if notthebest, I have ever read.Alicia shoots her beloved husband in the face five times, then never speaks another word. Theo, a psychotherapist, is captivated by Alicia's story and wants to help her. He thinks he can get her to speak again and divulge why she killed her husband. What follows is a search for truth in what really happened between Alicia and her husband.First of all, if you haven't read this book yet, you absolutely should. And you should stop reading my review and any other reviews/blurbs/thoughts about this book until you do. Because while I always strive to make my reviews 100% spoiler-free (this one included), there's something to be said for expectations. And there's no way reading anything about this book wouldn't sway your expectations.I made the mistake, after reading this book and loving it, of not only recommending it to a friend, but also talking up how much this book amazed me, how great the reveals were, yada yada yada. And so when she read it, she had built up an inkling of something to come and anticipated it, hence losing the element of surprise. So I inadvertently committed the biggest book faux-paus ever and ruined a fantastic book for a friend. It's something I regret to this day. (Elaine, if you're reading this, I'm so sorry!)I certainly don't want to do that again. So yeah, I'm warning you. Last chance to turn back if you haven't read this book.Okay, now that I'm among only those who are in the know, I feel like I can freely gush. How amazing was that reveal?! I usually have terrible book memory, but I'm certain I will remember that reveal for the rest of my life. It wasn't just what it was, but also how it was executed. Not only did I not see the twist coming, but I was so surprised I stared open-mouthed at my book and reread it multiple times to make sure my brain could comprehend the complete mind bend of what I had just experienced.But to simplify this story down to just its reveal feels like an injustice. At its heart, this is a confounding murder mystery and it includes all of the requisite parts—clues, suspicious persons, and red herrings. We are directed one way, then another. But like any great mystery, the real magic is in its sleight of hand. While we are focused on one thing, really something else is going on altogether. And at the end, we can only wonder at the sheer audacity of what it takes to pull off such a magical feat.The story grabbed me from the very beginning with an intensity that didn't let go. Once I started, I couldn't put it down. I was turning the pages as fast as I could, immersed in the experience and loving every moment. It only took me a few hours to get through the whole thing, and at the end my head was definitely left spinning in the best way possible.Recently, I read it again. I wanted to see if the magic of the first time is still there or if, now knowing the twists, the story would feel lesser than. And I'm so happy to report that I loved it just as much the second time around. Now, instead of having to pay attention to the plot, I could really focus on how masterfully Alex Michaelides built up the mystery and its reveal. And it really is something to marvel at.I have to say, books of this genre are always billed as astounding and surprising when most of the time they just feel contrived and silly with no payoff at the end. But wow, does this book deliver! It's so darn satisfying to read such a compulsively addicting story, with twists done right that left me absolutely speechless.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:The MaidensThe Fury~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

This will still be an overall positive review, but I felt I had to include some honest thoughts here as well for those readers who may need their expectations in line like I clearly did.The premise here is simply incredible; we have a woman named Alicia Berenson who is accused of murdering her husband and proceeds to clam up and keep quiet for the following six years, living during this time in a mental care facility called The Grove for highly dangerous folks. Enter Theo Faber, psychotherapist extraordinaire and flawed individual. He already has a respectable job elsewhere, but decides to transfer over to The Grove, even though it is a sinking ship, because he is obsessed with Alicia and solving the mystery behind why she murdered her husband. Along the way, we get snippets into Alicia\'s diary leading up to the murder, alongside of Theo\'s POV.I can\'t really give you anything more than this, because this is a novel that depends on you being fooled by the twist. You know, the big twist, the one where every blurb on the cover and every early review gives you a heads up, and perhaps that was part of the issue here for me. It seems these types of books that pull the wool over your eyes and take you by surprise are best enjoyed before anyone else has had a chance to read them. Let\'s come back around to the fact that I\'ve been reading mysteries, thrillers, and suspense novels for decades, way beforeGone Girlwas written and these domestic dramas with tricky slight-of-hand became all the rage. If you are new-ish to the psych thriller scene, and you whole heartedly enjoyed recent novels such asThe Woman In The Window, you will adore this. It was a well written, compulsive, slow burning build up to an explosive ending. Structurally, it had everything you could ask for, as it was well researched, engaging, and the perfect length of ""includes what we need without being overly winded"".Unfortunately, I\'ve seen this particular twist done numerous times, so I was clued in fairly early to what the big twist would be, and without spoiling or giving anything away, the lay out of the narrative in the second half of the novel is what fully clued me in, because it was too neat and tidy to end any other way. I will say that I was so satisfied and pleased with the way the author chose to close out the final chapter, and regardless of being surprised by the twist or not, it was a classic wrap up that will stand the test of time over the years.I think I\'m going to wrap it up here, and please don\'t let my 3 star rating dissuade you from giving this one a try. Michaelides is talented, and his writing is gripping and keeps you turning the pages regardless of the big twist. I would be honored to read his next novel and will most certainly look for his name in the future. In the meantime I have found so much in this novel worth discussing, from the portrayal of mental health care to the inner workings of various marriages, and think this will make a great winter book club choice for readers around the globe.*Many thanks to the publisher for providing my review copy via NetGalley.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Read anything else on your TBR first. Anything. Better yet, delete The Silent Patient from your TBR. If you do, you\'ll never know what it feels like to become aware that you could have spent that 4 - 5 hours reading a great book ... or at least a better book.... definitely a book that doesn\'t do a major disservice to anyone who practices in the mental health field or who lives with a mental health impairment, and maybe even a book that doesn\'t present misogyny on every page.The Silent Patient fails as a psychological thriller on all fronts. Its narrator lacks any credibility as a psychotherapist, as an employee, as a spouse, as a man. All characters are flat and inauthentic. The plot doesn\'t hang together. The solution telegraphs itself long before the ending, and still makes no sense. Michaelides wastes time on sub-plots that are irrelevant, introduces red herring characters with no subtlety so the reader is merely annoyed. Offers us a lawyer who is instantly available more than once to meet with someone he seeks not to meet., and a therapist who sees a former (long..... former, like .... years) patient at her home at 10 pm, and then risks malpractice by offering advice to him. And the writing is pedestrian, at best.Aside from its flaws as a psychological thriller, Michaelides demonstrates that he knows nothing about mental health diagnoses, treatments and indicated medications, but the biases he displays in this novel contribute to a culture of misinformation that may discourage a reader who needs treatment for therapy from getting it, and may discourage other readers from complying with a treatment plan that includes prescription medications in amounts that data shows have therapeutic benefits. The girlfriend, then wife, of the narrator, describes herself as ""crazy"" a dozen or so times, and yet this is not relevant to any sort of mental health diagnosis over the span of the novel. In a span of ten pages, he describes a character as being in ""a medicated haze"", but the med he names wouldn\'t cause that effect at any dosage. One psychotherapist meets with a patient 2 - 3 times and instead of evidencing any interest in the health of the patient, he primarily focuses on how her behavior might be disturbing her spouse. Another psychotherapist agrees to change a patient\'s prescription med mix on a whim, and overnight, without any plan for a gradual step-down or other concern for patient impact. A third character presses unidentified meds into a patient\'s hand and requires that she consume them in his/her presence. None of the medical professionals, save the one risking malpractice, demonstrate competency or concern for the welfare of their patients.All of the male characters running this facility repeatedly refer to all of the female patients as ""bitch;"" all of the patients in the facility are women. Every female character displays unpleasant behaviors that range in consequence from minor to severe: unfaithful, gossip-y, violent, vengeful, insecure, impulsive, annoying, tiresome, disloyal.I\'ve written a review of this horrid novel only because I might spare a friend or two. Every time someone deletes this book from his or her TBR without reading it, an angel gets his wings.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'As you will see, it’s an incredible story—of that there is no doubt.Whether you believe it or not is up to you.Ohhhh, I see why this book is getting so much buzz:it is virtually unputdownable.I didn\'t actually have any plans to readThe Silent Patient. I just happened to see it hanging around in the new releases, took a quick peek, and thought-- why not? Well, I\'ll tell you why not. You absolutely definitely should NOT read this book if you want to go to sleep and get up for real life stuff in the morning. I read this until my eyes were like ""nope"" and closed on their own.It\'s very compelling. A psychotherapist called Theo Faber narrates the story and he announces early on that he\'s pretty ""fucked up"". He worms his way into a new job at the Grove mental health facility because of his fascination with the artist Alicia Berenson, who murdered her husband in an open-and-shut case and hasn\'t spoken a word since.But let us not forget that while Alicia Berenson may be a murderer, she was also an artist.Theo finds himself connecting with Alicia and feeling a desperate need to figure out why she did it. And, what\'s more, he wants to figure out why she is silent. What can\'t she say? What won\'t she say? The more he digs into her life, her family, and her past, the deeper in he gets.It\'s a fast-paced ride with short punchy chapters (oh, how easy it is to think ""just one more chapter""). The story has so many threads and little surprises to uncover. More questions arise at every turn. And even those who work out the main aspect of the mystery will probably still enjoy the journey of finding out why, and all the little shocking discoveries made along the way.It is true that those who have read a number of twisty mysteries will likely guess the truth, but I think there\'s enough goodness here to make it enjoyable anyway.

Will Theo get Alicia talking again? What actually happened all those years ago?Yes, this book really is as good as all of the hype. The writing on this was really top rate. Michaelides knew perfectly how to create intrigue and how to use dialogue with varying short and long paragraphs and short and long chapters to create the perfect pacing for this work. It was incredibly page turning, and the author definitely showed his chops as a mystery writer. He could write a master class in mystery writing. And this is his debut novel! What will Michaelides go from here? Personally, I can hardly wait to find out.Theo is gaining information about what happened in the past, but he is also questioning his own abilities. Can he really get Alicia talking? What are the professional boundaries of a psychotherapist? There was a little bit of internal monologue with Theo, but it wasn't boring or drawn out unnecessarily but raised some deep questions, causing the reader to think beyond just the superficial mystery/thriller. There was also some mention of art and its deeper meaning. It helped to create added depth to this book.Overall, yes, yes, and yes! This book is phenomenal if you haven't read it already!

The women are all tired, cliched stereotypes that often veer into misogyny. For example, Alicia’s aunt is described the first time you meet her as an ugly, old face pressed to a window, and it only gets worse after that because—of course—she’s fat. Her “grotesque” (a word actually used in the book) appearance is apparently a mirror of her evil personality. How creative! The author takes that approach over and over again: young, naturally beautiful women like Alicia and Theo’s wife are worthy of interest, while the female characters Theo can’t find attractive—because they’re ugly, old, large, fat, fake, stupid—are only worth his disdain.Beyond that, the prose was tough to get through. And don’t even get me started on the diary sections, which portray Alicia as a woman who either sits in a coffee shop for hours on end, has sex with her husband, or paints him as Jesus (no, I’m not kidding). The chapters where she couldn’t speak were almost a relief.Overall, the author just seemed more invested in getting to the the clever twist ending than in writing a full-bodied story with women who seem like, you know, actual people.Which is a pity, because that clever twist ending had potential.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5 shining stars!We finally have a winner.

From the very first page I was seduced by the magnetic writing style of Alex Michaelides.Nothing is as it seems in this novel. This story is complex and multi-layered with a labyrinth of characters, each playing their part in the development of the plot.The author never once tries to lead you astray with erroneous clues in an attempt to distract you from an obvious conclusion.

All opinions are my own.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '(Throwback review) Isn\'t it strange that we immensely love and hate a book at the same time? Many of you might have had such an experience at least once in your lifetime. Well, this book was the one which gave me that feeling.First of all, let me start with what I liked in this book. The writing style of the author is suited for writing a thriller like this. He succeeded in making me glued to the book even after the glaring innuendos that were disparaging to the core kept me exasperated. He worked out the plot twist well. This might be the reason why almost every friend of mine in Goodreads love this book. I must confess now itself that if I was not a Doctor and I didn\'t know how the healthcare system works, I would also have given this book four or five stars.This is a book which won the best book in the thriller section in Goodreads award last year. If you are promoting a book as a psychological thriller, there are two things which the author should be careful about. One is to get the thriller aspect correct, which the author had succeeded, and the second is to get the Psychological aspect right, which is where the aberration lies here.The author had unabashedly mentioned some things about Psychotherapy in which some are true in some rare cases while some have unfortunately gone entirely wrong. The author has no right to generalise about the health sector as a whole based on some scrupulous activities done by some individuals. You can\'t even see such a shady Psychiatric institution in any dystopian world. Mr Michaelides, who is a Cambridge product, had an excellent opportunity to produce one of the best thrillers. Unfortunately, he didn\'t do the adequate research in the psychological aspects needed for this book.There are many mistakes regarding psychotherapy, treatment methods, various disorders, therapy sessions, medical ethics in this book. Initially, Theo, who happens to be a psychotherapist, is strangely saying that his father had a personality disorder which he is mentioning as an illness that went untreated for the duration of his life, which is, in fact, rather absurd. There is no definitive treatment or drug for the management of personality disorders. The only way in which we can manage it is by behavioural modification therapies like the DBT (Dialectical behavioural therapy) and CBT (Cognitive behavioural therapy). I am sharing four pictures here for my friends who are utterly perplexed due to being thrown into the crazy world of complicated medical jargon by the author in this novel bolt out of the blue.The author should have done more research on topics like the transference, countertransference, Borderline personality disorder, Narcissistic personality disorder before writing this book.I remember having an entrancing discussion about this book with one of my friends who is a Psychiatrist in D.C. We concluded that we should not be pedantic about it and leave it alone as just another painfully didactic fiction which came in the disguise of a psychological thriller.It is poignant to see Entertainment Weekly calling it ""an unforgettable — and Hollywood-bound — new thriller"" with ""a mix of Hitchcockian suspense, Agatha Christie plotting, and Greek tragedy."" I heard that the silver screen version of this book is in the pipeline. I humbly request Mr Michaelides, who also happens to be a screenwriter to correct all the flaws in the novel in the upcoming movie.I had the expectations of being enraptured by this book before reading it. But unfortunately, I abhorred this book to such an extent that I curtailed from reading other thrillers for some time. All the other thrillers I might read after this one will be desultory attempts. I am sure that I will recover from this one. I am sad that Alex Michaelides missed a golden opportunity to create a masterpiece.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""The thing about this book is that it’s only the plot twist.The story itself is just leadup to it.

If Theo’s attempts to encourage Alicia to speak are successful, will it be something he wants to hear?

But real love is very quiet, very still. It's boring, if seen from the perspective of high drama. Love is deep and calm - and constant.”HOLY SHIT! Wasn't this a mothefucking page turner? Like I literally read and listened to this in 2 home sittings, and 2 subway sittings. Holy motherfuck! I knew this Greek author could do it!#proudtobegreek. Honestly, all the Greek mentions in this book were porn to me. He wove a whole story so beautifully based on a Greek tragedy, it's wonderful. Anyone who is Greek in here, read this book. Love me some nice representation!This book was split into two sections:1:Theo's point of view2:Alicia's point of viewTheo's point of view is split into two categories... him talking about himself and his wife and him talking about Alicia and himselfAlicia's point of view is seen through her diaryI found myself not as interested in Theo's chapters about his wife as I was in the entirety of the book. I knew it is the kind of story where this part would actually mean something to the main plot and not just to show us aspects about Theo's life and his personality, but they were the least interesting chapters for me nonetheless. Apart from that,the book itself was extremely fast paced, deep and exhilarating.I just couldn't for the life of me, stop turning the pages. You all know your girl lost sleep for this. Yes, I motherfucking did.Was the twist good and unexpected? Yes. Did you have to suspend your disbelief a bit to make it work in your head? Yes. Was it amazing nonetheless? Yes. Listen, it was a really great twist but if Theo had told us from the beginning, it would lose the momentum.So it's a twist based on a character not telling us something he already knew.I find that a tiny bit weak. But it worked with the story and I fucking loved it ok?Overall, I loved this book so much. In this review I talked about the two reasons I didn't give this book 5 stars but don't let it fool you. This is one of the best books I have read this year and it will probably remain in this position once the year ends. It is full of intrigue, interesting characters and dynamics and a very fresh story. Trust me and pick it up.

Theo Faber, a criminal psychotherapist, has been obsessed with Alicia and her silence for years and he finally works his way onto the staff of at the Grove, a secure forensic unit and then manages to secure the position of Alicia's psychotherapist. Very little is really the way it seems in this addictive psychological thriller and it had me on the edge of my seat from the first chapter.I had so many questions about what was happening and what had happened with both Alicia and Theo. Theo is so ready to lie, manipulate, and use people and even though Alicia was the murderer, think I felt more danger from Theo and his shady practices. And then I was hit with twist at the end of the book, which took me by surprise. I knew something was up but I hadn't quite figured it out and was thrilled with how the book took me for ride, tripping me up along the way.Published February 5th 2019""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '***NOW AVAILABLE***Well looks like I’m the outlier on this book as I have been reading many glowing 5 star reviews. Maybe I’ve been reading too many thrillers lately. For me to love a thriller all of the characters have to be well developed and intricate to the story, the plot has to be a good one and have more to offer than just the “thrill”, or wow factor at the end of the book. I found the characters to be shallow and the plot seemed to run off in several directions throughout the course of the novel.I should add that a 3* from me means that the book was just an o.k. read for me, not bad but not great enough that I will be thinking of it long after I’ve finished or be recommending it to my friends. Still worth a read :)One thing proved true, this book did have me turning the pages quickly to find out what would happen at the end. However while I was turning these pages quickly, I wasn’t really getting very much out of the story. I felt as though the fact that she wouldn’t speak was the main focus of the book rather than looking into whether she was really guilty or not. I know that she had been tried and found guilty but I had hoped that perhaps the doctors would find other issues worth pursuing regarding her guilt or innocence.There are multiple characters introduced but none of them are really very well described. Dr. Diomedes is the head of the facility and he appoints a new doctor, Theo Faber, who has recently joined the staff to oversee Alicia’s care. She had previously been under the care of another physician but he hadn’t made any progress with her and so it is hoped that this new doctor will help to make her finally speak.The book is narrated by Theo and then later by Alicia as we begin to read her previously hidden diary.The book takes place in “The Grove” a private facility for psychiatric patients. Theo Faber transferred from another facility because he is obsessed with Alicia’s case. We do get to know him through his thoughts about his own marriage to Karen who seems increasingly “busy” and coming home late from rehearsals, she is an actress. This is a storyline that is introduced and somewhat developed and then just left hanging. What really is going on with Theo’s marriage? He seems to be spending all of his time at the facility with Alicia.SPOILER ALERT***Alicia had been a successful artist and Gabriel a photographer of some repute. There really is never any answer to the question of “why”, why would Alicia kill Gabriel. There doesn’t seem to be any evidence that they were unhappy or that Gabriel was unfaithful, there doesn’t seem to have been much research as to why she would kill her husband. She was convicted because she was found at the scene with the gun in her hand, covered in blood because she had slit her wrists in an attempt to kill herself.The twist is a good one but doesn’t come until the last 20 pages or so. I had pretty much figured it out by then but I’m sure it will come as a surprise to many.I would say read it without reading lots of reviews, decide for yourself if it is indeed “the debut novel of the year for 2019” as the publisher has written in the blurb for the book! After the last session that Theo had with Alicia he is writing everything down while it was still fresh in his mind and he states ""As you will see, it\'s an incredible story--of that there is no doubt. Whether you believe it or not is up to you.""I received a copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides is a 2019 Celadon Books publication.When this book first started to garner a little buzz, I initially shied away from it. I am still avoiding psychological thrillers for the most part. However, the reviews were so overwhelmingly positive I relented, adding it to my TBR list. After a lengthy wait at the library, I finally obtained a copy, and dived in with no small amount of cautious optimism. Was it worth the wait? Did it live up to the hype?The set- up is instantly intriguing-Theo Faber, a criminal psychotherapist is oddly obsessed with the well- respected artist, Alicia Berenson, a patient housed in a forensic unit after shooting her husband five times in the face. She hasn’t uttered a word since. Theo sacrifices better and more lucrative opportunities in hopes of becoming her therapist. As he manipulates his way into Alicia’s life, his determination to unlock the secrets of her heart and mind slowly yields a few surprising results. However, all his probing could have a few unforeseen consequences...Anyone who has read a review for this book has, by now, heard about the stunning twist that apparently caught most readers off guard. But, let’s not get too hung up on the twist. In my humble opinion, a mind -blowing twist is a requirement of any and all psychological thrillers. What makes a twist work in the first place is the mystery.Did Alicia kill her husband, as all the evidence suggests? If so, what was her motive? Why hasn’t she uttered a single word in all these years? This is a compelling mystery. Alicia an enigma, to be sure. This is unsettling enough on its own merits.However, the author also examines some hard truths about institutions that rely on funding, which leads to money and power taking precedent over the welfare and health of the patients. Adding in yet another rich layer is the unique and quite interesting mythological parallel woven into the story.It is easy to step into Theo’s narrative as he slowly walks us through Alicia’s past, dropping hints and clues along the way, introducing us to all the possible suspects, while delving into Alicia’s fragile psyche.But, if I am being totally honest, the plot is not all that plausible, and at times the execution warbles. There are some problems within the story, but in my humble opinion, this is how a pure psychological thriller should be presented. The author relies on paranoia and the emotional instability of the characters to build suspense as opposed to grisly, graphic crime scenes. It’s a mind game from start to finish.Now, about that twist-The most important thing to me was that it was singular. No over the top, unnecessary twists added for mere shock value. A good PT doesn’t need more than one, maybe two, depending on the author’s experience or the situation- in my opinion.In this case, the reader is totally blindsided, tapped on the shoulder from behind, by a revelation so shocking, I’ll bet some of you gasped out loud. I know I did! It messed with your head, right? Now THAT’S what I’m talking about!!Of course, after all that buildup and the success of the big plot twist, the ending had to come together, or all was for naught. I was a little concerned for a few minutes, but honestly, the conclusion was the cherry on the cake.The book was worth waiting for, but I am glad I proceeded with caution and kept my expectations in check. The story is not quite strong enough to merit a five -star rating, but I appreciated the pure, traditional understated approach. The author wisely dialed things back, distancing himself from the oversaturated parodies many current psychological thrillers have become. I hope the popularity of this book with inspire more authors to follow this more authentic prototype and restore the psychological thriller back to its former glory.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3 to 3.5 starsI have a few friends that are probably going to wonder why I am not rating this one higher. I did think it was a decent thriller and I can tell why many rate it high. But, it is also easy for me to tell why someone would rate it low. I am just going to hang out pretty close to the middleThe best part of this book was definitely the resolution. The build up to it was okay, but not all that suspenseful to me. There were a few big moments throughout the book, but it was mainly just exposition. Also, I figured out the ""mystery"" early on. This is not me tooting my own horn like I am an amazing detective. It was more like I stumbled on it by accident. About 1/3 to 1/2 of the way in I thought,""wouldn\'t it be interesting if . . ."" and that is exactly what happened!The characters were kind of flat to me. I think part of my opinion on them is tainted by the fact that I just finished another thriller, The Whisper Man. In that one, the characters are much more dynamic and the relationships are much more interesting. Despite some twisting and turning, the relationships here are plain vanilla and a bit predictable.I will stress again, especially because I know that many are rating this one highly, that my criticisms above are just little things that I felt and I know for certain that others won\'t feel at all. So, don\'t read my review and go in thinking it is going to rate middle of the road for you, too. You might be one who really gets into it!Basically, an entertaining thriller. Not too deep. The perfect book for a quick escape. Easy to read and follow the twists and turns. Solid, but not really exceptional.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Sadly I have read Fifty Shades of Grey, so I cannot call The Silent Patient the absolute worst book ever. Instead I\'ll just call it awful, truly and in all ways, from its portrayal of mental illness, to its utter lack of believability, to its stupid, stupid, stupid characters. One of whom gets an eyeball gouged out and I almost feel like doing the same to myself for having read this thing from start to stupid finish.The story takes place in a mental institution, where most of the psychiatric professionals are presumably tweens and teens. Patients are permitted to wander at will carrying items such as broken cue sticks, which I would think might be a bit jagged and sharp and thereforepotentially quite dangerous, but, what do I know. Theo, the main character-slash-psychotherapist, gets a job at this facility and on his very first day he decides which patient he\'d like to treat. He is not only permitted to treat his choice of patient -- he is also, conveniently, given no other duties aside from trying to get this SILENT PATIENT to speak. I feel like he should have at least had some paperwork, some standard mandatory training modules, something. But no.Anyway, the SILENT PATIENT has been silent for years, ever since murdering her husband, but no one else bothers with her anymore because most of the rest of the staff think she\'s a ""bitch."" Theo, in a true flash of psychiatric brilliance, wonders if perhaps heraggressively drugged stuporis preventing her from talking. Really it\'s a wonder none of the other doctors thought of this. In any case, his boss naturally agrees to reduce the dosage of her medication right away. I am sure that in real mental health facilities this is exactly how it goes.At one point, Theo discovers that one of the staff has been selling opoids to patients. His immediate thought: ""I wondered what else he was up to—perhaps I had been a little too hasty to defend him so determinedly to Stephanie. I’d better keep an eye on him."" YES, Theo, definitely KEEP AN EYE ON HIM. Jesus.In the meantime, Theo decides to harass his patient\'s family and friends to see if they might provide clues as to why she won\'t talk. There is a dramatic scene in which a cousin takes Theo up onto a roof. For no reason. ""This is where we were when we heard her father say the thing he said to make her crazy for the rest of her life,"" or some such nonsense. AHA, it\'s all coming together now!As to why Alicia, the patient, won\'t talk?Well, she\'d just been held captive by a masked man for hours, and when her husband arrived home he suggested that the masked man kill her instead of him, most likely because he didn\'t realize he was in a novel and that such husbands in modern fiction do stand a good chance of being murdered by their fictional wives. For whatever reason, at that point the masked man decided he\'d had enough for one day and left, killing neither of the two. And then Alicia, presumably perturbed at her husband\'s less-than-chivalrous behavior, shot him five times in the face. And apparently after all that, she simply had nothing to say.That is really the reason.*Thanks universe that this was a library book and not an actual purchase*'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'WOW... This is a great book.This is a psychological thriller, and it is one of my favorites. I really did not see the book ending like it did. I cannot say much about this book without giving away to much of the book, but I felt it was a great book with some of the best twist I have read. I think if you did not see the ending coming you will like it, but if you guess the ending will may not like it as much.'}]"

If you feel satisfied enough to just remove yourself from this review, run with that feeling. Because I have, like. Seven pages of sh*t to complain about.That’s if I’m efficient.And I’ve never been an efficient reviewer. Once. In my life. I counted two hundred (and two) uses of a word over seven hundred pages. That shouldn’t scream “rational and in control of her passionate fury” to you.So buckle up, buttercup. We’ve got some categories to run through.DISCLAIMER: This review is teeming with spoilers. It is also X-rated, due to the strength of my anger and the copious sex scenes in the source material.I HATE THESE CHARACTERSRhysmakes me cringe harder than Renee Zellweger in Bridget Jones’ Diary. (At least that movie has both Colin Firth and Hugh Grant to distract me from Renee viciously critiquing her own body and, like, spilling coffee all over herself or whatever.) He is capable of two actions, like a mildly impressive Ken doll: 1) sex person and 2) valiant hero trying to kill himself in the name of his friends constantly. Either he is full on f*cking Feyre (sick alliteration, Emma) or he must be actively prevented from jumping in front of poisoned weapons with the half-hearted motivation of Heroism To Save My Family (even if it’s not at all clear why doing this would save them, because whatever none of the plans in this book make a lick of sense anyway).Because, as if this book weren’t fun enough, it rivals the Fast and the Furious franchise for use of the my-real-family-is-the-one-I-made-not-the-one-I-was-born-with cliché.Like Rhys,Feyrealso manages to find time in her packed schedule of sex scenes and repetitive dialogue to be incredibly, incontrovertibly dumb. For example, when she traps Ianthe and ties her up or whatever, she spends an unbelievable amount of time indulging an evil-villain-revenge rant. Just enough time for her to be CAUGHT BY THE DAEMATI (a Cassandra Clare-esque douchey term that pretty much means “species of bad guy,” to the best of my recollection). So much of this book was me silently screaming.Speaking of the aforementioned schedule, it’s no wonder that that thing Feyre used to do called “painting” is dropped like a hot potato. She never does it, but it’s mentioned a handful of times in the beginning of the book. And then forgotten. And then, suddenly, almost at the merciful end of this suffering:“The movement so perfect that I knew I’d one day paint it.”We’restillpretending that Feyre paints? Between the same diverse selection of identical sex scenes, identical training scenes, identical war discussion scenes, I don’t think she has time for something so banal as a singular interest or hobby. Idk if we’ll have time; I think she’ll have to get to third base with Rhys in a perfumed bath later.At least Feyre is brave and strong, though. Which is why she’s “too tired” to do anything after a loooong day of watching other people fight in a battle, followed by Mor winnowing her home. So courageous. How does she do it.Plus, she’s a brilliant friend. Which is why, when Morrigan confronts her for lying, leaving, making her and everyone else fear she has died and also making Mor responsible for it, Feyre’s response is “OH YA??? WELL YOU HAVE A CRUSH ON AZRIEL.”Truly a depiction of a powerful woman for the ages.And I don’t getLucien’s appeal. Do we like him out of the same reason we like Draco? (I’m saying “we” as if I like either of those characters.) Is it an omg-he’s-just-trying-to-do-right-he-didn’t-know-any-better type situation? Because Draco is a child trying to impress a father who doesn’t love him and I still don’t totally buy that. I’m still not a Draco fan. And Tamlin is not Lucien’s daddy, although...maybe a more interesting book if he were.CassianandAzrielare both flat and boring.Amrenis characterized so inconsistently that it’s impossible for me to know whether I like her or not. (I’m going to say “not” - seems like a safer bet.)Nestais almost cool, but the whole I Am Mean And Hard And Damaged thing goes too far. AndElainjust floats around and lets things happen to her.Morrigan, never all that interesting, now just represents the worst bisexuality rep I’ve ever read.It’s never a good sign when you’re praying for characters to die in battle just so you can catch a f*cking break.But guess what. None of them do.THE WRITING SUCKS, ON BOTH A COPYEDITING LEVEL AND A SUBSTANTIVE LEVELI truly believe that whatever team of sad sacks was assigned to copyedit this book was physically unable to attentively read it. And I cannot blame them. But it does allow for some hilarious mistakes to make it through these dull, dull pages.Example: “She did not avert her eyes from the Morrigan.” That pesky “the” makes her seem like a pro wrestler, or someone with a fun nickname, rather than the personification of the worst bi rep ever to grace young adult pages. But we’ll get to that.There are so many ellipses and dashes and italicizations and...other - ways: ofbreakingup the TEXT that it actually gave me motion sickness. On top of everything else this book has made me suffer through.Maybe if a copyeditor had found the strength to make it through this book, they could have stopped the way SJM insists on using the term “Hybern.” IT MEANS SO MANY THINGS. “Hybern” is used as the nomer of the evil king, the word for his people, the name of his kingdom, and the title of the land it’s situated on. That is just...basic bad worldbuilding, no?Also, a monster creature thing described as having no eyelids narrows its eyes. This inspired a fifteen minute long discussion with my roommates on whether eyes can narrow without eyelids. We came to a unanimous consensus: no, they cannot.Also, asValpointed out in her amazing review of this book, the words “vulgar gesture” are used over. And over. And over again. WHAT DO THESE USES MEAN. WHY DO THEY CONSTANTLY INSPIRE LAUGHTER IN WHATEVERGLORIFIED PROPCHARACTER WHO HAPPENS TO BE NEARBY. IS THIS TACTIC SUPPOSED TO REPLACE ACTUAL JOKES OR BANTER? Because it doesn’t. It just makes me angry, and also confused, which makes meeven angrier.And who thought that was even possible.WHAT IS THIS ATTEMPT AT HIGH FANTASY LANGUAGEExcept then, y’know, Rhys and Feyre and the Gang are also so hip and cool and up to date that this book uses the word “fuckable,” a word so slang-y that my laptop recognizes it as a typo for “suckable” or “faceable,” whatever the hell those words are.Otherwise, the only other remarkable attempt at making this any different from the way humans speak in 2017: the use of the word “male.”Women are sometimes called “females” in this, but are also called women and girls and whatnot. Men, on the other hand, are absolutely only called males. There’s an amazing moment when SJM refers to Rhys as a man, and then instantly, like, corrects herself. So it reads on the page as “man - male -”It makes no sense. I love it.It’s truly the little things.THE END OF THIS BOOK IS JUST A LISTING OF CLICHESAs the war we’ve waited for finally arrives, and so does the time for motivational speeches and tragic goodbyes and other things that fail to make me feel something, SJM loses it entirely.Nearly every line of dialogue in this section is just a cliché, and so I will copy and paste them here, for your perusal and accompanying amusement.“Leave this world…a better place than how you found it.”“One life may change the world.”“I believe everything happens for a reason.”“It is the family you make, not the one you are born into, that matters.”“Light can be found even in the darkest of hells.”“The great joy and honor of my life has been to know you.”“I wasn’t sure if in the entire history of Illyria, there had ever been such a discussion.”So bad. And, therefore, so good.LET’S LAUGH AT DUMB THINGSThe moments when this may or may not be attempting to instill some sort of entertainment or amusement in its reader do not work at all. Luckily, we have something much better: Really dumb stuff. It is much more fun (and nourishing to the very soul, like a bowl of chicken soup - so pretty much the series of books “Chicken Soup for the Soul”) to laugh at something unintentional and dumb than it is to laugh at a cheap joke. This is why the show America’s Funniest Home Videos has been on for twenty-eight seasons, and like a thousand interchangeable bad sitcoms are canceled every year.For example, this passage. Feyre and Rhysand are apart, blah blah blah, it’s the tragedy of the century (or millennium, since these boring ass people live for infinity, because there is no justice in this world). Unsurprisingly, they use their mind control powers for a saintly motivation: sexting. Which is already so hilarious. But it gets even better, because:“I sent back an image of me sticking out my tongue at him.My clothes were back on when his answer arrived.Like mine, it was wordless, a mere image. Like mine, Rhysand’s tongue was out.But it was occupied with doing something else.”I choose to interpret this statement the same way a middle schooler interprets the existence of performer Marilyn Manson based on a shady rumor he once heard about a surgery to remove three ribs. I believe that this is incontrovertible evidence that Rhysand can suck his own d*ck. WHAT ELSE COULD HE POSSIBLY BE DOING. WHAT COULD IT POSSIBLY BE OCCUPIED WITH. SJM I JUST WANNA TALK.But just as often as I was making myself laugh by making Rhys my YA fantasy version of Marilyn Manson, I was being equally amused by seemingly innocuous lines. Like when Eris, scary villain/abuser extraordinaire, was bidding The Night Gang adieu and said, “See you at the meeting in twelve days.” I MEAN. WHAT. WHO SPEAKS LIKE THAT. Even dialogue is just an opportunity to force an info dump. You guys, seriously: this book isso poorly written.LET’S SCREAM ABOUT DUMB THINGSSometimes, or most of the time depending on how you look at it, I do not want to laugh at the dumb things. Sometimes I am incapable of it, because this book is an ungodly length and so much of it is long-term stupidity.Chapter 45, for example. Or, as I like to call it, “That Meeting in Twelve Days Finally Happens.” Yes, this book is so boring that we are expected to anticipate an actual, literal meeting. Sure, it’s a meeting between high lords to talk about war, but it’s still a sit-down political discussion. And also it’s just the same endless repetitive cycle of insult dialogue feat. fun moments of The Night Gang being the least convincing people on the entirety of the Earth.There’s an especially great moment in that adrenaline-inducing conference. For the 800 pages leading up to it, Rhys is all,“Ok, Feyre. Listen up. Number one thing - just don’t show your powers, k? Long story short the Powerful Men are going to get pissy and then…well y’know these negotiations are the most important thing to happen in hundreds of years, which I should know because I’ve been alive for that long, even though you’re, what, fresh outta adolescence? Anyway just the only thing you should do is not show your powers.”To which Feyre’s response is,“Got it. *shows powers instantly*”YES. Feyre shows her powers at the meeting!! So quickly!!! She doesn’t even try all that hard, and, as promised, it almost derails the nonstop excitement of this much-anticipated civilized forum! Almost. Except then everything works out, as it always does, by Feyre saying something totally normal, 6/10 at best, and everyone being like “wow omg...who is this girl...she is so smart and brave and honest and we respect her so much” so that Rhys can be like “that’s my mate lol.”IRRELEVANT COMPLAININGThe only way to make the experience of reading a deeply unpleasant, extremely long book worse is to publish that book with goddamn tissue paper pages. This was like reading the Bible but without the action. And with a whole lot more smut.I’m tucking this quote in this section too, because I don’t know if I’m being persnickety, but at one point, it’s said that“Only a madman would wield the might of his army just to get revenge on three women.”And my question is, why use the word “women”? Why not “people”? Is it more insane if it’s women? Why is that? TELL ME WHY. REALLY I JUST WANNA TALK.PLOTLINE? WHAT PLOTLINEThis book is just...so boring.There are countless info dumps, which, I mean. There’s no excuse for that in a third book. This was going to be the last book in the series, when there was still hope in the world and I prayed that somehow SJM actually was writing these books for some sort of artistic fulfillment rather than money. How, I ask you, would there still be so much sh*tty worldbuilding in the last book in a series?OH YES, THIS BOOK IS DEFINITELY WOKE AND NOT THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF THAT ENTIRELYSJM has been getting a lot of sh*t lately for her white/straight/cis narratives. So it’s no surprise that she would try to get those pesky activists off her back this time. Unfortunately, she does a remarkably bad job.This book is all straight people except for LGBT+ relationships based on sex alone, or in an unequal relationship wherein one person has authority over another. (Examples: a high lord whose bisexuality extends purely to the fact that he’s into threesomes; a military captain dating his high lord/commander/boss.)Plus, there’s bisexuality rep so terrible it took me hours to make it through a handful of pages. But that gets a category of its own.I also shouldn’t be surprised at the redemption of abusers in this book. Because Tamlin, in ACOTAR, was just a Nice Guy. Fine. But the fangirls loved a certain bad boy guest star with purple eyes. So, instead of creating a love triangle or transitioning between love interests like a normal person, SJM made him into an actual abuser. A villain.That’s also fine. But you can’t just redeem him like you could redeem the unloved side of a love triangle. Because you made him into a genuinely bad person.Unfortunately, SJM must have missed that memo. She must have missed it three times, actually, because Eris also gets redemption (and a throne!). As does his enabler brother, Lucien. Wonderful. Abuse apologists for the win.But this book is totally, definitely feminist, right??? I mean, female protagonist! War plotline! It must be, by default! So when Cassian says“I told you that the moment we started letting females into our group, they’d be nothing but trouble”, and woke king Rhys responds,“You actually said you needed a reprieve from staring at our ugly faces, and that someladieswould add some much needed prettiness for you to look at all day.”it’s totally fine!So it’s an utter shock that this narrative also lives nearly entirely within the bounds of gender roles. Reading about men (Rhys, Cassian, Azriel, all the high lords) fighting in battle while the women (Feyre, Mor, Elain, Nesta, Cresseida) watch and tend to the wounded later is sorefreshing. Doesn’t make me want to blow my brains out at all.And no, Mor being assigned to babysit Feyre later on, only heading into battle because Feyre tricks her into fighting so she can sneak away does not make it better, thanks.This is definitely, certainly the feminist YA fantasy you’ve been waiting for, folks.THE WORST BI REP EVER TO HIT THE SHELVES, WHICH IS INSANE BECAUSE WHEN IS THERE E V E R GOOD BI REPBut I haven’t mentioned the most unforgivable thing yet. The thing that made this book my first SJM one-star, after giving every other book I’ve read by her two stars. The thing that actually made me feel real hatred and fury and, worst of all, sadness.Truly, the worst bisexual representation I have ever read comes in the final chapters of this book. I’ve read a lot of bad bisexual rep. And it’s endlessly upsetting. But none of it felt quite like this.Apparently, Sarah J. Maas decided in the third book that she wanted to stop getting sh*t for her heteronormativity. So she decided to take a character who had been established as straight, and make her bi.So she took this character, Morrigan. She makes Morrigan cry. She writes Morrigan’s impassioned speech to Feyre. This is Morrigan’s coming out, for the first time. Morrigan says that she prefers women. To the point that she is only capable of feeling romantic love for a women.But occasionally, she will force herself to sleep with a man. In order “to keep people from looking too closely.” Instead of telling the man who has been in love with her for centuries that she doesn’t love him back, won’t ever love him back, she forces herself to sleep with men when he’ll know that she’s done it, so that she still seems straight but he’ll know she doesn’t love him.And the author dubs it bisexuality.I hate that she felt entitled to use this underrepresented, misunderstood sexuality as a playing piece in her own quest to be well-liked. I hate that the hundreds of thousands of people who read this book have been given this depiction of bisexuality. And I hate that Sarah J. Maas will keep writing wildly successful books. Books in this very series, depicting this character in this way and calling it “bisexuality.”It’s unfair. It’s awful. And I am never, never, never going to forget that it happened.Bottom line: I didn’t expect to like this book.

No, I don’t. Good kids.“You High Lords really do love your melodrama, don’t you?”(As if I hadn\'t got enough ammo already.)For honesty\'s sake, the last two thirds of the book I could only bring myself to skim through (and I\'m quite proud of myself for managing even that). The first third had accurately enlightened me as to what I was to expect, and my (abysmally low) expectations were met point by point.We girls of the SmutClub weren\'t able to do a proper buddy read as we did last year with ACoMaF due to real life kicking our asses. However, I\'m sure you don\'t want to missSarah\'sandReyes\'sreviews, andEmer\'scall for honesty and good sense when it comes tothe target market of this series(and of theThrone of Glassseries too, at this point) perfectly highlights a problem I haven\'t been able to wrap my mind around since it first arose.•First of all, I\'d like to take a moment to answer a question that no one asked but that I think it fair to take into account nonetheless, said question being, ""If you evidently don\'t like Maas\'s books, why do you keep reading them?""Very good point indeed.I used to consider her books a guilty pleasureuntil, well, yesterday. The word ""pleasure"" in that expression, though, baffled me very much even before. More correctly, reading her was an experience akin to getting your first period at school and noticing too late (mortallyembarrassing), while ranting about it later was an honest if inclement exercise in snark, just as reading other people\'s reviews with previous knowledge of the book was pure amusement, be them positive or negative, and this latter reason is probably what always convinced me to suffer a little for the greater fun. Sometimes I also enjoyed some parts, so mine wasn\'t all sadism, after all. ButA Court of Wings and Ruin? (I still have no clue about what this absurd title is supposed to mean.) This one wassheer torture.A bore. Like havinga pitchfork repeatedly shoved in the eyeballs.(I should refer you tomy review ofA Court of Mist and Fury, which already contains many, if not all, of the issues I had with this final installment too, because since I\'ve read that book with way more attention than I did ACoWaR, you\'d probably find that one more specific and generally accurate.)•The writing gets worse. It\'s a miracle -or whatever its opposite would be called. Saying that it\'smelodramaticdoesn\'t begin to describe it anymore; admitting that its basic rule isemotional manipulationwould be such an understatement, my fingers itch. Everything is amplified, everything is exaggerated, everything makes twice the noise that it should make proportionally to its dimensions. Which is to say,everything becomes grotesque.Ridiculousness abounds, especially when matters of the heart (you haveno ideahow much I struggled not to use some other word that would have been more fit to the case at hand there) are concerned. I\'ll make just two quick examples both taken from chapter 14.The examples may contain mild spoilers.“Where are my sisters?” The thought clanged through me, jarring as a pealing bell.Rhys paused, hand slipping from my hair as his smile faded. “At the House of Wind.” He straightened, swallowing—as if it somehow checked him. “I can—take you to them.” Every word seemed to be an effort.But he would, I realized. He’d shove down his need for me and take me to them, if that was what I wanted. My choice.It had always been my choice with him.”To spell it out, what Feyre\'s voice is implying here is that one point in the never-ending list of reasons why Rhysand is worth worshipping is that he is able to keep it in his pants ten minutes longer so that she can go say hello to her sisters, whom she hasn\'t seen in more than a month and who, last she saw them, had just undergone a devastating trauma. It is evident that Maas isstillshoving in our faces that wemustabsolutely love Rhysand... a pity she isstillpicking all the wrong reasons, because what I think when I read a scene like this is ""Someone please lock him away"" (and I\'m being kind).Example number two(trigger warning: this one\'s rather disgusting. I for sure gagged once or twice.), this oneto show what I mean by ""overwritten"" and ""grotesque"" and ""ew"":“You have a choice,” he murmured against my cheekbone. “Either I lick every inch of you clean …” His hand grazed the tip of my breast, circling lazily. As if we had days and days to do this. “Or you can get into the bath that should be ready by now.”I pulled away, lifting a brow. “Are you suggesting that I smell?”Rhys smirked, and I could have sworn my core pounded in answer. “Never. But …” His eyes darkened, the desire and amusement fading as he took in my clothes.“There is blood on you. Yours, and others’. I thought I’d be a good mate and offer you a bath before I ravish you wholly.”I huffed a laugh and brushed back his hair, savoring the silken, sable strands between my fingers. “So considerate. ThoughI can’t believe you kicked everyone out of the house so you could take me to bed.”“One of the many benefits to being High Lord.”“What a terrible abuse of power.”That half smile danced on his mouth. “Well?”“As much as I’d like to see you attempt to lick off a week’s worth of dirt, sweat, and blood…”His eyes gleamed with the challenge, and I laughed again. “Normal bath, please.”You see what I mean? Maas triesso hardto write steamy, sexy moments that she stopped noticing that the way she writes them became (a long time ago I dare say)utterly ridiculous. What sane person in their right mind would ever say ""I’d like to see you attempt to lick off a week’s worth of dirt, sweat, and blood off me?""Many, many,many, if not all, of the problems this book has are linked to the writing,silly,childish,bloated,cheesy. It sourseverything.•Not totally disconnected from this, there is also the insistence with whichFeyre\'s bliss with her Court of Friends and Familyis continually trotted out, especially if there\'s the opportunity to describe it through someone else\'s point of view, as it happens with Lucien\'s in the first part of the book.There is a reason if one of the axioms of storytelling is that talking about happiness is difficult: it\'s uninteresting, poor of nuances, syrupy: people don\'t want to hear about happiness. “Happy families are all alike,” after all.•One of the main points ofFeyre\'s character arcshould be her discovery of independence and of her inner strength, of the fact that she doesn\'t necessarily need anyone, especially a man, to guide and direct her every step. A shame the impression we get from the whole series isthe very opposite: Feyre\'s character growth (not automatically meant as an upward trajectory) seems to be irreversiblyconnected to the ""male"" who is (even virtually) at her side. In this book, she and Rhysand are pretty much a single entity. Can I feel a tinge of outrage at this, please? We women are very able to be complete on our own, thank you very much. The whole""mating system"" (I can\'t even, it\'s too ridiculous)has me not exactly convinced in this regard too. Various characters throughout the book keep having this attitude, especially towards Feyre, that impliesa vision of women as mere objects of sexual interest, pawns in a purely male game of lust and authority, and they are never challenged because their brain is full of crap, but simply because they insult Feyre–and not even Feyre as herself, but Feyre as Rhysand\'s mate, like during the meeting of the High Lords in chapter 46, when someone calls Feyre ""human filth"" and Rhysand\'s reply is physical violence plus a laconic“Don’t ever,” Rhys said, hands sliding into his pockets, “speak tomy matelike that again.”Again, everything, even on the level of language, revolves around a man and the girl\'s relationship to said man. I fail to see the women\'s empowerment in this.•I\'ve never seensuch a cheesy ending. It feltlike I had just swallowed a monumental bucket of melted sugarand I couldn\'t even breathe because the very air got stuck to the sticky back of my throat. Basically it made me finally understand that Maas\'s main interest was to make sure none of her precious babies got so much as a scratch.➽ I was trying to find a way to be tactful and diplomatic about this, but there is none. The first book was nice and very entertaining, the second was still entertaining but way less nice,the third is ignoble. Bottom line:this series is crap.Don\'t read it(and if you know me and my reviews, you know Ineveronce recommendednotto read a book, nor do I think I shall ever do it again, because the fact that I don\'t like something doesn\'t mean that nobody would or should. Besides, I don\'t really believe in second-hand opinions. So the fact that I think this book will actively damage your brains and that I\'m warning you off it should really speak volumes in itself).

It\'s unpolished, full of unnecessary repetition and lazy placeholder sentences.Maascanwrite. She\'s proved it over and over again, which makes ACOWAR seem almost criminal. I think the strain of writing two novels a year finally caught up with her. ACOTAR AND ACOMAF don\'t really count because they were written long beforeThrone of Glasswas published. All she had to do was clean up. But ACOWAR was written back-to-back withEmpire of Storms, which was a beefy number on its own.Fervent as I was for ACOWAR, I wouldn\'t have minded waiting another year if it meant getting quality content.Second is the ending.Rhys lives, Amren lives, everybody fucking lives.Where are the sacrifices? How it can possible that no one in this bloated main cast dies? (Don\'t you bloody dare point to Feyre\'s dad. He was barely a presence the entire series, and I remain firmly convinced Maas brought him back just to fill the death toll and shut up people like me.)I understand Rhys\'s resurrection—he\'s Feyre\'s mate and fan favorite and therefore too important to die—but Amren too? Her losing her godly power is not a sacrifice. She\'s still High Fae. Why not make her human? Why not have a human serve in the Night Court? Or why not have Cassian or someone else lose their wings? Quite a few reviewers (and me included) havementioned this already, but Maas undeniably has an obsession with inhumanly powerful characters.On the subject of Rhys, it would have been so, so cool for Feyre to be the sole ruler of the Night Court. The first High Lady in history. And it would have been a fitting end to her character arc. She was dependent on a man in the first book, was broken by the same man in the second, and then healed and made to see she could be powerful and independent by another man. In the third, she stands alone, back straight, strong and proud, without a man. Obviously I\'m oversimplifying things here, but you can\'t deny the pieces line up.Also, that deus ex machina army in the end. Oh, we\'re on the edge of losing! All is lost! BUT WAIT here\'s an army. And ANOTHER army!Another thing that bothered me is howunbelievably powerful Feyre is.There is feminism, which is an underlying theme for her character, and there is what-the-fuckery. Near the beginning of the book, she is able to take on two daemati (powerful fae) who have a thousand years of fighting experience over her. Later, after she accidentally ingests a drug that strips her of her powers, they still magically flare back to life to help her triumph over two seasoned High Fae fighters.Right, I think I\'ve bitched enough about the bad.Let\'s get to the good.I love the characters.The Inner Circle, Lucien, Nesta, Elain... they are a huge part why I rated ACOWAR as high as it is. Feyre and Rhys—in this book and this book only—aren\'t as interesting. Their story in terms of conflict was finished in ACOMAF and although I enjoy how Maas explores how normal couples argue and make up, I\'m not as invested in them as before. There are too many other stories begging to be told: Lucien\'s, Elain\'s, Nesta and Cassian\'s, Mor\'s, Tamlin\'s.Yes, Tamlin. This fandom is too hard on him—and too forgiving of Rhys. I will never forget what he did in ACOTAR. Yet because the story is filtered through Feyre\'s perspective, Rhys becomes a hero who makes mistakes and Tamlin becomes a monster who commits unforgivable sins. He genuinely thought the woman he loved had been abducted and was likely being tortured. I\'m not excusing his abusive behavior, but we have to remember he was suffering from PTSD too. He was trying to protect Feyre the best he could—just like Rhys by forcing Feyre to make that bargain with him way back in ACOTAR, fyi. Why does Rhys deserve dozens of free passes and not Tamlin?Hating the High Lord of Spring just because Feyre does is a disservice to the complexity of his character.I also like that Maas seems to bepulling away from the whole ""mates"" concept.Multiple characters within have strong romantic relationships without the mating bond, and those that do may not necessarily be right for each other.Much as I love the idea of Lucien and Elain, I get the feeling that she\'s setting them up for something different. Elain and Azriel, and Lucien and Vassa.The pacing is good, too.There aren\'t as many sex scenes as the previous book, which I was happy about, though not due to any misguided sense of propriety. I simply found myself bored reading about Rhys slamming his shaft up to the hilt or what not.Still lowkey mad the first thing Feyre did after coming back from the Spring Court is bang Rhys and not check on her traumatized sisters.While I liked them in ACOMAF, there are more important things going on here, like the war or the other courts.Final verdict? Bring on the spin-offs.My review of A Court of Thorns & RosesMy review of A Court of Mist & FuryMy review of A Court of Frost and StarlightMy review of A Court of Silver Flames'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I wish so much that I could tell you I loved this book... but I just didn\'t.After thinkingA Court of Mist and Furywas such a huge improvement fromA Court of Thorns and Roses, I was really excited for this third installment. I even preordered it. But I really struggled to get into the book from the very start. Frompacing issuestoawkward sex scenesthat did nothing for me, it was one disappointment after another.I\'ve said this before but I reallydislike Maas\'s sex scenes. At her best, she writes them strangely with words like ""branding"" and ""claiming"", but here they were just plain icky. With all the talk of ""mates"", ""growling"" and ""purring"", and the climaxing from stroking one another\'s wings, I felt like I\'d walked in on two animals rutting in the mud. Ugh.And another thing-- Feyre and Rhysand are already mated and loved up to their eyeballs so there wasno sexual tension, no will they/won\'t they, which made the sex scenes so boring.What\'s strange about these sex scenes is how they manage to somehow be both graphic and coy at the same time. Maas never actually uses explicit words. If a young kid picked up this book, they might assume Rhysand and Feyre were dancing or playing an instrument.His touch turned different. Exploring. Broad strokes and feather-light ones, arches and swirls and direct, searing lines.And her vagina is usually described as ""there"" or ""where I want him"". Then, at the same time, these scenes are weirdly overwritten, with her orgasm (obviously not called that) leaving her “skin glowing like a newborn star in its wake”. It\'s just really not my thing.I was disappointed with the writing in general, to be honest. Maas seemed to write a lot more ""tell"" and a lot less ""show"" than usual. I was especially disappointed at the wasted opportunity for some underhanded manipulation in the first part. After how the last book ended, Feyre was kind of ""undercover"" at the start and in a position for lies and sneakiness. Except it was mostly her swanning around and quietly seething to herself about how much she hated Ianthe and how much of a douche Tamlin is.I thought this whole part was boring when it should have been extremely tense and exciting.But I think the worst thing was the overall pacing. It\'s a long book, but I can normally sprint through Maas\'s works in a day, yet here it wassuch a slog. Especially the first half. It\'s taken up with a lot of character conversations and strategizing for the upcoming war with Hybern. It lacked a pull, a sense of urgency, some kind of tension to make me need to know what happens next.I cannot believe they\'ve announced anotherfour booksfor this series. Why??? I can only hope they are some kind of spin-off series because, otherwise, either a) we will have to suffer through who the fuck knows how many more awkward, unsexy Feyre/Rhysand sex scenes, or b) Maas will destroy Rhys\'s character and hook Feyre up with yet another hot fae dude. I\'m not sure which is more likely.The later chapters of this book picked up in pacing, but I think it wastoo little, too late. This is a whopping 700-page monster and it obviously didn\'t need to be. I will say that I liked how things were left with Tamlin, but seeing as that part was only a few sentences long, it doesn\'t make up for everything else.I\'m thinking this is where I drop out of this series.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Just published my latestBookTube Video- so excited to share it!The Written ReviewAfter that ending only one quote can adequately sum up my feelings:Something thumped in front of me.

Thank you for letting us dream and travel across the stars if only for a short time.I have been a massive fan of the ACOTAR series since the first book so I was highly anticipating ACOWAR.I was afraid I wouldn’t like the third book as much as I loved the second one but hell, I was so wrong. I swear, I don't know how many nerve cells this book cost me.Not only is the book thrilling and well-written. But it added a lot more complexity than I'd expected. Both in the characters and the plot.The progression brings aboutso many new faces(Have five to Helion, my second favourite High Lord), each of them unique in their own way.When Feyre was in the Spring Court, she was so over-powered like she is a goodness and no one can stop her -I was getting some unwanted Aelin’s vibe here– butthe plot was pretty well-driven after that, allowing each character to have its share of glory in Hybern Battle. And thank god for incredible plot twists or else I would have died a thousand times.The other thing that I really enjoyed is the fact thatthe book was unpredictable. I got all emotional becausethe story has a way of being built up and simply torn down piece by piece by a certain event and you are like “What the hell just happened?” and then being rebuilt once again.I literally went mental in one of the last scene – YES, THIS SCENE –my parents were actually concerned because of my change of emotions. I cried during the emotional moments, I got stressed during the battle scenes, I laughed so hard in others, I blushed during the bold sexy scenes, but most of all,I had – and still have believe me - embarrassing fangirling moments over the characters.I have a lot of favourite scenes.Like a lot especially those where a potential couple interact –You should have seen me during NESSIAN SCENES, I was a FANGIRL MONSTER– butone scene particular brought me to tear and that was RHYS’s SPEECH BEFORE the FINAL BATTLE.Overall, it wasan EPIC BOOK closing an AMAZING trilogy with immensely ENTERTAINING STORYLINE, characters TO LOVE and a DETAILED fantasy WORLD.Very much worth your time.What are you waiting for?""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Yay!

I have always been more of a fan of Sarah J Mass fan, but more towards her Thrown of Glass series. I think this is her best book so far. This book just has everything. Great characters, great story, secrets, betrayal, redemptions, ACTION!!!! You name it, it is here. 700 pages and not a line wasted. Hell, I would have been happy with another 700 pages of this standard. The character are great, but there is such great character development that no one is one dimensional the character are conflicted and complex with their own strengths and issues. Every time I learned something about one of the characters, I wanted to know more. Every character had their moment to shine in this book, and every character in this book could very easily star in their own book. That is the depth of the character in this story. Espicallly Rhysand, and anyone in the Court of Dreams.Since the last book, Feyre has returned to the Spring Court to destroy it from within. This is not Feyre crushed by her truma, suffocated by overprotection, or the powerless girl in a world of monsters/guardians. This is the angry, powerful, deadly calculating woman. I like the fact that Rhysand is every bit her match. I am actually interested to see which of them is the more powerful. So far, with centuries of experience behind battle, tactics, and studies, he seems to be a step ahead, but time will tell. However even with all this going on War is coming to Prythian and with all the High Lords in agreement (with their history of grudges and betrayal this is next to impossible ), they are still way out numbered against the King of Hybern and the power of the Calderon. Once again, it falls to the Court of Dreams to lead the charge not only against their enemies but the very thinking of many Prythians as well.This is just an awesome book. I don't think you have to read the other book in the series to love this book, but I would definitely recommend reading the whole series, but I definitely read this one. The more I read, the more I wanted to read. It took me through every emotion, the anger of betrayal, the pride in overcoming adversity, to the election of victory.

The tedious pacing, the lack of tension (and lets be honest action as well), along with the awkward, singular attempt at diversity, I just can’t give it more than 3 stars.

Maas-ish in a way that did not surprise me but still made me terribly emotional. It wasn’t the ACOMAF-emotion, it wasn’t the EoS-emotion, it wasn’t the KoA-emotion, it wasn’t the HoEaB-emotion.This book has had its own emotion, I swear. It was tough, but somehow it was milder than the others previously named.Except for what happened on page 666.I cannot forgive that.I almost had both a heart attack and a stroke at the same time. And I am still not over it and I still feel like SJM pulling shit like this on me is exactly why I might need therapy.After the pure emotion of the previous book in the series,A Court of Wings and Ruinshows the final battle and all its raw and powerful emotions and actions. The dirty and the bad and the ugly – there are all of them there.This battle though is also freedom. No one is above scheming anymore. One must do everything they have in power to win because the cause is holy. There are sacrifices that must be made and plans that must be developed.This battle is also about unity and the book shows us how important this is. When there is a common goal at stake, then pride must be left outside when entering the war-tent. And true masters of war know that. Everyone must work together because victory is in the numbers.Aside from the compelling emotions that charge a book deeply powered by the promise of war, there is another facet of the plot.Thecharactersdiscover alter-egos, personalities that they did not know they had. Or they knew and they tried to reprimand them as hard as possible. Everyone has to overcome their own selves and that is a battle too.“It’s a rare person to face who they truly are and not run from it – not be broken by it.”Every character has their own secret that springs out with the tiniest occasion it gets to have. We see different angles of Cassian and Azriel, of Mor and Amren, of Nesta and Elain, of Tamlin and Lucien. They all fight two battles – of freedom and of self.Rhys and Feyre get to discover and unravel themselves too, but where Feyre finds her vengeful self, her strong and determined essence of a ruler, Rhysand shows us his vulnerable, soft side. The side that determined him to sacrifice himself to keep the ones he loved free.In this book, Rhysand is his ultimate selfless self. And honestly, nothing in this world would make me not love this hell of male.Sarah hit the jackpot with this gem, I’m telling you.If I had to get through absolutely every single emotion this book gave me then I’ll need something stronger than infused water to keep me going, a big cone of chocolate ice cream and probably a re-read of the whole ACOTAR series just to be sure I get everything right.I love how cunning and ruthless does SJM get when writing her books and even though sometimes there is no need for something like this, ACOWAR had to benefit from that. How else could such a mesmerising story end but in tears of frustration and raw feelings, I’m asking you?I honestly fell so hard for this series it became one of the things I think I’ll love in my life forever and ever. Glad I could read it and right now, writing this sorry of a review, I am considering so hard re-reading all of the books because damn, this helps my mental health in so many weird ways I can’t even seem to understand it myself.If you haven’t read the beauty of the ACOTAR series, please just go for it. Your life will be complete and you’ll probably thank me later ;)“Maybe one day, when the earth had grown old and died, when the stars had vanished, too…maybe then, we would return to this place.”'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4.25/5 stars""Remember that you are a wolf. And you cannot be caged.""I want to print off a picture of this cover and keep it in my wallet. Just in case anyone asks me if I have children, I can just show them this.Because all these assholes are my children.I don’t even know where to start with this review. I’ve been writing things and then deleting them for weeks. Every combination of words just isn’t therightcombination I need to right the perfect review.Sarah J. Maasalways releases not one, but two gigantic books a year and I don’t even know how to write a thousand word review? Actual proof that SJM is a writing goddess. We have been blessed from the heavens.So anyways, I\'ve decided to write whatever the hell comes to my head. So this entire review is one huge train wreck. It\'s an unorganized mess. I\'m gonna apologize for that right now. It also contains unmarked spoilers because it is almost three thousand words long and I don\'t have time to go through and mark every single spoiler.ACOWAR had the unfortunate luck of having to proceed the epicness that was A Court of Mist and Fury. It’s like being given $1,000,000, spending it all, then being given only a $100,000. Both amounts of money are nice to have, but obviously the million is the better option. Or like watching Beyonce perform live in concert, then having to watch a youtube video of Beyonce. Both are nice, great options, but there is always going to be the preferable one. I actually feel sorry for ACOWAR. It didn’t deserve to be a follow-up toA Court of Mist and Fury, but it really didn’t have an option. ACOWAR is better than ,A Court of Thorns and Rosesbut if you were to look up the definition of “prefection” in the dictionary, there will be a picture of the ACOMAF cover.Let me just get some of my thoughts & feels written down real quick. Beware, some might be spoilery. Please proceed with caution.A COURT OF THOUGHTS & FEELS1. Rhys is actually the best fictional character ever and I love him2. Feyre is actually the best fictional character ever and I love her3. Mor is actually the best fictional character ever and I love her4. Lucien is actually the best fictional character ever and I love him5. Amren is actually the best fictional character ever and I love her6. Azriel is actually the best fictional character even and I love him7. Cassian is actually the best fictional character ever and I love him8. Tamlin is actually the worst fictional character ever and I hate him9. I hate him so much10. Seriously11. Who okay’d Tamlin as a character?12. They should be fired13. Ianthe sucks too14.I’m glad that bitch got destoryed by the weaver15. We could have done without the sex scenes though.16. Remember when they were in the library? And all they wanted to do was have sex and not read. Talk about unrealistic.17. Rhys is the most dramatic character in YA…...pass it on18. The beginning, when Feyre was at the Spring Court, was actually my favorite part of the entire book? I loved it.19. I was just like yaaas Feyre girl you destroy those losers20. Also when Feyre and Rhys were reunited that was cool21. I wanted that scene to be longer though with a lot less sex22.Also the Suriel’s death was not okay’d by me and Sarah will be hearing from my lawyers23. Also who approved the term “vulgar gesture???” They should be fired too.24. Also if I ever hear the word ""mate"" again I\'m gonna spontaneous combust25. Cassian + Feyre = A friendship you will never have26. Mor is gay and all is okay27.Also no one in the night squad died which is really unrealistic to me? Also kinda disappointing. I was preparing myself for a death that never came, which took time away from me preparing my funeral.28. Also Amren is the best thing to come out of this book29. If the sequels aren’t about her I’m sueing.30. Also does anyone know why we were fighting this war? I don\'t remember.31. And also does anyone remember how the high lord powers work and why they all happen to be the most powerful people their courts but they get their position through genetics? Because if I haven\'t learned anything from YA literature, at least I\'ve learned that there will always be a chosen one who\'s more powerful than any ruler. So why hasn\'t that happened?CHARACTERS! cHARACTERSFeyre.Feyre is the best? She has evolved so much since the first book. And she\'s so loyal to those she loves. But if she hates you, you are dead. There is no way to save you.Rhys.I don\'t know if you knew this, but in certain countries it\'s agaisnt the law to hate Rhys. He\'s the best.Tamlin.Remember that time when you used to like Tamlin? Hahahaha he\'s an asshole.Mor.She\'s gay! Which is also the only diversity we got in this book.But she\'s the best.Amren.I want to be her when I grow up. She\'s the best.Lucien.I am just so glad that Lucien found God in this book.Cassian.I just love Cassian? I just want him to wrap me up in his wings. He\'s the best.Azriel.I would leave my boyfriend Kaz for Azriel. He\'s the best.SUMMARY AND COMMENTARYI’m going to do something I never done before in a review. There are so many scenes that I just want to talk about, that I’m gonna summarize a lot of this book so I can talk about them. This entire thing is spoilery so please don\'t read unless you\'ve read the book.So we start off athellthe Spring Court and Tamlin is being is douchebag self like always. He’s just hanging around, doing his meninist things. Not realizing that Miss High Lady of the Night Court over there is slowly taking down his court.A nightmare, I’d told Tamlin.Iwas the nightmare.I was kinda hoping for more telepathic interactions? I wanted Feyre to say something like, “Oh Rhys was just terrible to me.” and Rhys to just pop up and be like, “Terribly good in bed.” or something like that. But that never happened. SJM really threw away her shot.Hamilton would be disappointed.I’m going to be honest here. I didn’t really understand how Feyre took down the Spring Court? Like I know she did it by gaining the people’s trust. But I didn’t understand that sunlight scene or all the uneventful trips to the wall. Also Ianthe didn’t die in the first part which was disappointing. BUT IANTHE DOES GET HER HAND SMASHED INTO LITTLE PIECES BY FEYRE WHICH IS SO FREAKING BRUTAL I screamed the entire time like wow I don’t like the bitch either but did she really deserve to have her hand continuously smashed? I am a good person who has morals and part of me is still like “yeah she deserved that”Anyways Feyre is eventually like #byelosers @ the Spring Court and leaves. She takes Lucien with her which is really cool because Lucien deserved better than those assholes. So Lucien and Feyre flee the Spring Court, which at this point is burning.In fact I have an actual, never before seen picture of the spring court taken shortly after Feyre leftSome stuff happens and there\'s fighting because it’s a high fantasy novel and not having any fighting would probably make it a contemporary or something. But anyhow, Cassian eventually comes and helps Feyre and Lucien with the fighting. And the Cassian/Feyre reunion is the best reunion in this book? Like what Feyre/Rhys reunion?I met those laughing, fierce hazel eyes.Cassian’s smile softened. “Hello, Feyre.""My throat tightened to the point of pain, and I threw my arms around his neck, embracing him tightly.“I missed you, too,” Cassian murmured, squeezing me.Honestly, that scene was the absolute best? Like after that, the Feysand reunion was so underwhelming. It happened just a few pages later but it wasn’t cute dialogue and hugs and ***friendship*** Their meetup was crying on the floor then having unnecessary explicit sex.SJM is great and all, but her sex scenes are the worst. I understand that sex is a thing that exist and Feysand participates in it, but I just don’t care about the details. I would rather have more Amren dialogue.So at one point during all this reunion sex, Feyre tells Rhys that he likes a dramatic entrance which has just won an oscar for “understatement of the year”. Because obviously, Rhys did not crash Feyre’s wedding in ACOMAFThe next part of the book is just like plotting and stuff. It’s kind of boring. I honestly almost fell asleep during the next two hundred pages? I mean I didn’t though because this is a SJM book but I could have. There was no action. No suspense. At least I had Amren and her I-don’t-give-a-shit attitude to keep me awake.There is the library scene which is the worst scene in the entire book. So Feyre and Rhys are in this gigantic ass library surrounded by books which is like life goals right? If you don’t want to be surrounded by books then gtfo of my review. But anyways, instead of appreciating the luxuries they have in their life, Feyre and Rhys spend the entire time flirting with each other? This annoyed me so much. It was the most unrealistic scene in this entire series. I don’t care if my High Lord mate was there with me. If I was in a library surrounded by books, then he doesn’t freaking exist in that moment.Also there is a giant monster thing that lives in the basement of this library that everyone is afraid of? #goals“If you hadn’t stolen my bride away in the night, Rhysand, I would not have been forced to take such drastic measures to get her back.”I said quietly, “The sun was shining when I left you.”So Rhys and Feyre and the rest of the squad decided to throw a party. By party I mean, they decided to get all the incredibly powerful, opinionated fae in one place and try to come to an agreement. This is such a smart idea. Just wow. They also invite Tamlin to be nice and then they act surprised when he shows up??? Like you guys sent him an invite to your birthday party??? It would be rude of him not to come???? Why would he turn down free cake like that?!?!?!Tarquin took him in. Then me. And the others. “I rescind the blood rubies. Let there be no debts between us.”“Don’t expect Amren to return hers,” Cassian muttered. “She’s grown attached to it.”So the greatest thing ever happened during this meeting? And I’m not talking about when Feyre destroyed Tamlin when he was being a prick. No, I’m talking about how Amren isn’t returning her ruby that marks her for death? She’s so iconic. I want to be Amren when I grow up.Then, while all these high lords were in the same place and wasting time fighting with each other,donald trumpthe King ofHybitchHyburn brings down the wall that they were all tryingnot sodesperately to protect. And again, they were all surprised.Like are you fUCKing kidding me? How did you not see this coming???? You are standing around, doing pratically nothing. Wasting all the time in the world. AND YO UARE SUPRISED THAT HYBITCH IS ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH WITH HIS PLANS. YOU KNOW HE WAS TRYING TO BRING THAT WALL DOWN. he WAS GONNA DO IT AND YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY WAS THE PERFECT OPPURTUNITY. Honestly, I am surprised he didn’t succeed earlier than this?So noW that the wall has been destroyed and is never coming back, all these high lords realized that if they are going to win this war, they are gonna all get off their asses to do something.Also what even are we fighting for? All I know about this war is that the King of Hyburn is bad and the Night Court Squad is good. How did this war even start? What did Amarantha have to do with anything? Who even is Myriam person and what does she have to do with anything? I know it was probably explained in ACOMAF but that was a year ago and I was too busy placing my attention on Rhys to pay any attention. So at this point I’m 469 pages into the last book of this trilogy and I don’t even know what we are fighting for? I’m emotionally invested in a war I know nothing about. Is this what politics are like?Anyways, the squad and their newly found high lord allies go to take down Hybitch.So then Feyre has this brilliant idea to go find out good friend the Suriel. I forgot the Suriel even existed tbh. He’s so creepy that I am sure my brain purposely block him out from my ACOTAR memories. So we go find Mr. Suriel and he is near the Weaver’s cottage.I also blocked the weaver out from my memories so, if you are like me, this is when you bust open your ACOTAR coloring book, flip to the picture of the Weaver, and then pretend to remember.So the Suriel is kinda helpful but unhelpful as always. But Feyre still cares about him becasue why would’t you care about the creepy monster that doesn’t even have a proper name and you\'ve only met like three times? So Suriel, that unhelpful yoda, is in the middle of giving Feyre vague advice when THAT BITCH IANTHE SHOWS UP AND JUST SHOOTS HIM WITH AN ARROW FOR NO GOOD REASON. Obviously having a crushed hand hasn’t affected her aim any.Someone should just kill that bitch already. Which is exactly what Feyre does. And she isn’t even easy on her. She takes Ianthe into the Weaver’s cottage and the weaver like eats her. Gross. I would have atleast chosen a less graphic demise. And something that kills her a lot longer.How fortunate are we that we caught the impossible-to-catch Suriel for the third time right near the cottage of a monster thing that likes to eat bitches? We are soooo fortunate.“Feyre Archeron,” the Suriel said again, gazing at the leafy canopy, the sky peeking through it. A painful inhale. “A request.”I leaned close. “Anything.”Another rattling breath. “Leave this world...a better place than how you found it.”So after murdering Ianthe, Feyre goes back to the dying Suriel and I haveThe Hunger Gamesflashbacks to Rue’s death scene. I was kind of expecting Feyre to gather flowers to place around the Suriel. And obviously, even though we are in a world surrounded by magic, there is no way to save the Suriel. He dies. I’m devastated. You are devastated. I still vaguely remember the Suriel from the past two books.And if I’m honest, this all could have been avoided if Feyre wasn’t so dramatic and just asked the Suriel to coffee or something.Oh also, I just happened to have stumbled upon this picture of Feyre that was taken one time after someone was shocked she caught the SurielMore stuff I don’t care about happens blah blah blah and then Feyre’s sister, Elain, is somehow kidnapped by the cauldron.Also making a cauldron the most powerful object in all the universe is the stupidest thing I’ve ever read.How did the Cauldron kidnap Elain? I don’t know it is never really explained how that inanimate object does anything. Remember, I still don’t know why the crap we are at war here. Anyways, Feyre gets really upset so she goes undercover as Ianthe and infiltrates the Hyburn army and saves Elain. Feyre goes through maybe one obstacle along the way and then returns to her mate Rhys.Also, if you are a person who participates in drinking games, then here’s a fun one for you while you read the book. Every time the word “mate” is said you drink. And get drunk during the first chapter. You\'ll be in the hospital by the third chapter. So actually don’t play that drinking game.And was I the only person who felt this entire thing was so unneeded? This is a 700 page book and we are nearing the end and now we are going on missions that run a little too smoothly? Like I know Azriel gets hurt but he’ll heal perfectly fine because we live in a world of healing magic that works on bat wings but not bitch’s hands.More fighting. There is a lot of fighting that happens. It’s like they are at war or something.Oh remember Feyre’s father? Yeah, I don’t either. But he comes back. I didn’t know he was gone but he came back with ships named after his daughters and Odette fromSwan Lakebut instead of a Swan, she’s a firebird which might just be a stupid name for a phoenix, oh and he name isn’t Odette. Anyways, her father finds this queen they just happened to be looking for even though there’s no way he could have possibly known that because he has been missing for 37297843 years. So obviously, because of this all his past sins are forgiven instantly. Then her father eventually dies because ofTrumpHybitch and we are suppose to be sad about it but I’m still standing here likeThen, on page 666, because Sarah is in fact the devil, the unthinkable happens. MY BABY RHYS WHO IS SUPPOSE TO BE PROTECTED AT ALL TIMES DIES. YES DIES. AND AT THIS POINT I’M CRYING IN THE CORNER AND WANTING TO THROW THE BOOOK INTO A VOLCANOAnd I’m just like, “If he ficking stays dead then at least all 700 pages of this book will make great kindling to warm my now cold heart”But then I remember ACOTAR and how Feyre here died and then was brought back to life so I start looking at the other high lords who happen to be near us at this moment and I’m just “Hey do a girl a favor here AND BRING BACK MY BOYFRIEND.”But then I also remember there’s a certain asshole who is also a high lord who has to help and I Start FREAKING out but then he comes through and he’s just like “Be happy, Feyre,” and SAVES RHY’S LIFEYou still an asshole Tam, but maybe just a little bit less.ANd I’m just crying in the corner even harder than before.Then somehow they defeat the King of Hybitch and Feyre and Rhys live happily ever after. Both are alive. The #NightSquad is still alive. Beause that is super realistic.Looks like the only person who is dead here is me. Oh well.CONCLUSIONSo while ACOMAF is still the best, this is still a great novel and I loved it? Being with all my children again is all I have ever asked for in life and I \'m just glad that they all ended up happy.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '4.8/5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️“Only you can decide what breaks you, Cursebreaker. Only you.”Let me talk to you about this book. This bookKILLED ME. This bookDESTROYED ME. This bookANNIHILATED ME. This bookOBLITERATED ME. This bookELIMINATED ME. This bookWIPED ME OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH. This bookEXTERMINATED ME. This bookERADICATED ME. I will never recover. How can I function after this fucking book? I was supposed to read it slowly becauseA Court of Frost and Starlightwill arrive here after a week and I have had serious issues waiting for those books in the past, but I couldn\'t stop. The last 300 pages were marvelous, they gripped me by the balls and took me with them on this amazing journey. I was reading till6amyesterday. No regrets. The feels are always heightened this ungodly time of day. And I\'m so happy I read this book at that time. But let\'s start from the very beginning.Looming war threatens all Feyre holds dear in the third volume of the #1 New York Times bestselling A Court of Thorns and Roses series.Feyre has returned to the Spring Court, determined to gather information on Tamlin\'s manoeuvrings and the invading king threatening to bring Prythian to its knees. But to do so she must play a deadly game of deceit – and one slip may spell doom not only for Feyre, but for her world as well.As war bears down upon them all, Feyre must decide who to trust amongst the dazzling and lethal High Lords – and hunt for allies in unexpected places.This book started off strong enough. I was extremely excited about Feyre infiltrating Tamlin\'s Court and taking him down. She would be such a badass. I expected this part of the book to be bigger, to be honest. About 250 pages, to be exact. I really enjoyed the scheming, the planning, the cleverness of Feyre, how she turned everyone against one another so brilliantly. I hated Tamlin and Ianthe more in this part of the book, obviously. They were both manipulative, controlling and toxic. They truly deserved each other. Lucien gained some respect from me in this part of the book. I was really disappointed in him inA Court of Mist and Fury.Afterwards, the pace of the book gets a bit slower than I would have wanted. I expected it to happen, because the ""format"" of these books is always the same, for me at least. A very powerful beginning, then the pace lags a little bit and in the end the trueBAM! But it was different for me in this book. I didn\'t feel the same excitement its predecessor gave me (till page 400). And I understand why. The previous book opened up a whole entire different world to me. From the Spring Court and everything we thought we knew was right, everything changed. And we start off getting to know everything in the Night Court, and it was all exhilarating. As much and even more as it was getting to know the entire world of everything in the first book. Getting to know Rhysand and his true incentives, the inner circle, the world, seeing the romance bloom between Rhysand and Feyre. In this book, everything is settled. We know everyone, the world, the romance is stable. There aren\'t as many new things happening, except when we get to page 400. Till this page, I would have given this book 4 stars, which is low for this series for me, because I LIVE FOR IT.I\'m going to talk a bit about the first 400 pages, before my favorite part of the book starts. After Feyre arrived in the Night Court with Lucien, everything took a certain pace. We got to feel Velaris again, the inner circle, Rhysand, the conflict, the problems. A gargantuan War is coming, and they had to deal with it. Gather allies, forge a plan, make actions, bargains. This entire chunk of the book was about the war and how they would end it. And I truly enjoyed that but it didn\'t keep me on my toes, you know? Till page 400.PAGE 400. THAT\'S WHERE THE REAL SHIT STARTS. And then we got to page 400. When the meeting starts. This is the part I couldn\'t leave the book down. The part where if anyone commanded me to leave the book down, I would have killed them. Like fucking Feyre would. This meeting was so enthralling. The tension was keeping me enraptured the entire time. I\'m content that we got to know the other High Lords of Prythian, we got a better understand of the world and its people. They were all truly incredible characters (except Beron), especially Helion. I loved his humor, his swag and that he\'s bisexual. I noticed something very important in this book. There was more representation. Not enough but more. We got to see black characters, bisexual characters, gay characters, lesbian characters (MOR I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, I\'M SO PROUD OF YOU GIRL). This series isn\'t known for its diversity, but it was nice to see some more examples popping up. It was refreshing.But anyway, let\'s continue with the meeting. I was so proud of all my Night Court babies, how they handled it. Each question a challenge that was met brilliantly.IF I COULD I WOULD STAND UP AND APPLAUD AZRIEL FOR ATTACKING ERIS. FUCKING ERIS.And also my Queen Feyre, who showed her true powers without fear of the High Lords. Of so many High Lords, who could easily kill her. And then Tamlin enters the Dawn Court room. I thought there was a limit to how much I hated him, but he surpassed that. His crude, distasteful and inappropriate comments were so unnecessary. Dude, we know how fucking butthurt you are that your girlfriend left you for a better man than you, but we\'re here to discuss how to prevent the War, your comments are fucking irrelevant. Be a better man for once and show some restraint. Now wonder even Lucien left you. Lucien. Oh man. Helion is Lucien\'s father. I was so fucking astonished. This book bestowed many plot twists for us, and this was one that gripped me tightly. I don\'t even know the reason, I just really like Lucien all of a sudden. More than I liked him in the first book. And I genuinely appreciated how he trusted Feyre, and how he acclimated himself to the Night Court. How he saw good in Rhysand and his people, after all the propaganda of the latest hundreds of years. How he wanted to be useful and help do something significant for the War.I WANT TO DISCUSS HOW FEYRE IS SUCH A SHIPPER, IT HURTS. Feyre is like us. She ships her friends with each other and tries to make the ship happen. I\'m so proud of her. I\'m so proud that she actively participates in her friend\'s happiness. She ships everything I ship, and I couldn\'t not notice it, it\'s so obvious. I want her to succeed. I want her to find the best fucking girlfriend for Mor, cause my girl deserves happiness. They all deserve it, but her more, in the relationship factor. I\'m very sorrowful that in this world, a lesbian woman can\'t thrive. It mirrors our own world, to be exact. Some people have the resources and the family behind to support them, and some people just, don\'t. Mor has been so unlucky in the romance department, with her cruel family stopping everything that she does. I want her to come out, and I want Feyre to be beside her and support her.I WANT TO TALK ABOUT NESTA AND CASSIAN. NESTA AND CASSIAN. The ship I was rooting for since the previous book. The ship that is killing my heart slowly and painfully.THEY HAVE TO BE MATES. PLEASE TELL ME THEY\'RE MATES. And even if they\'re not, their dynamic is so strong. Their scenes so utterly powerful, even them staring at each other had me dying in my seat. I want them to thrive. They are my favorite couple, after Rhysand and Feyre, and I want them to prosper. There was such a gradual progress with them. Sarah handled this couple\'s dynamic amazingly. How we started seeing, little by little, how Nesta started caring more about Cassian. How gentle he was with her, with her feelings. He didn\'t push her, he didn\'t drive her to the edge. I want more of them, I want them to take over the world. Nesta is such a favorite character of mine. Strong, unyielding, snarky, flawed, raw, true. She is perfectly flawed, the way I like my characters to be. This book series doesn\'t favor flawed characters. Most of them are impeccable, outside and inside. But Nesta isn\'t. She still shows her humanity and I love her for it.We talked about Nesta... now we have to talk about Elain. Useless, needless Elain. I didn\'t like her in this book. I loathed her moping around, her extremely extravagant sensitivity, her outmost obsolescence. I couldn\'t stand everyone defending and protecting her, all the fucking time. Oh poor little Elain, how bad must it be for you to be immortal, young and beautiful forever, aw I feel so sorry for you. She didsomethingin the end by stabbing The Hybern King, but not something miraculous. Nesta integrated the action. I just didn\'t enjoy her character in this book, she was utterly annoying to me.This War man... this War. It was the most tit gripping thing I have read in a very long time. The adrenaline was high up in heaven. It was jaw dropping, breathtaking, awe-inspiring. When the hope was lost, there would be hope, and when there was hope, it would be taken harshly out of our grip. There was so much shit happening, so many characters appearing, to help, to condemn. Strategies being thrown our the window, plans succeeding, failing, bargains breaking. There was just.. so much happening. I couldn\'t keep track of everything. The action was astounding, the plot twists out of this world, the thrill spectacular. I devoured these chapters in a heartbeat. I wasn\'t even looking at the pages or chapters, or even time, I was just reading. This book was a true and amazing ending to an incredible series. I\'m so happy I picked these books up. This series made me love fantasy again. I have stopped being a fan of fantasy for many many years, and these books reintroduced me to its virtues.I WANT TO READ MORE FANTASY BECAUSE OF THESE BOOKS YEAH.RHYS\'S DEATH GUYS. It happened in page666, how convenient. I didn\'t feel a heartbeat for a minute. I know he would survive because he\'s in the next book, but you know how it is. I was utterly heartbroken by Feyre\'s reaction. She made me feel what she was feeling. I cried. Literally. And hear me out a bit. This is a huge deal for me. I never cry with books. The only books I have ever cried about are theHarry Potterseries and theOutlanderseries. Which are my all time favorite books of all the fucking universe. When I started crying, I was so surprised at myself. I was so happy I did. Because Rhys has become one of my all time favorite characters, and seeing his demise broke me. Like Feyre\'s heart was broken. And then Tamlin gives his last speck of light and saves him. Let\'s talk about him and his redemption arc.You have seen my feelings about him in the fist part of this review. In the end, they shifted, just a bit. I truly appreciated how he helped Feyre, how he saved her. And how he saved Rhysand\'s life. I don\'t like him, but I value how he got over his grudge, and actually helped everyone, for the good of Prythian. I forgive you, Tamlin, you\'re still a piece of shit of a character with many unsolved issues, but as Feyre said“I hope you find happiness, too.\'""And I did. Not just for what he\'d done for Rhys, but...Even for an immortal, there was not enough *time* in life to waste it on hatred. On feeling it and putting it into the world.So I wished him well -- I truly did, and hoped that one day...One day, perhaps he would face those insidious fears, that destructive rage rotting away inside him.”You get a pass, bitch. I\'m curious of what will happen to his relationship with Lucien. It will be interesting.I have written 12000 words for this review. And 8000 are left. I will surpass Goodread\'s character limit. Lmao. I had so much to say about this book, the ending of a marvelous series. I couldn\'t help myself and I\'m very sorry for this chaos of a review. My feels are still raw and unedited. And if you\'re reading this right now, you\'re a true hero for going through all of this shittone. And I love you for it.To sum it all up, this book was a truly magnificent journey and an incredible ending to a wonderful series. I\'m literally speechless, and I will think about this book a lot. For a very long time. Nothing else more I can say, this review explains it all. I will crawl now to my bed and die peacefully of the feels. And till the next one... K BYE!7500 characters left out of 20000.LMFAO.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5/5 ✧･ﾟ: *""I would have waited five hundred more years for you. A thousand years.""This was the easiest 5 stars of my life, and for sure my favourite book in the series. I wish I could attach the video of me hysterically crying. I felt so much for this story, world and characters. So many things like tugged my heart strings, whilst being whimsical at the same time. I laughed and cried - this was just sooooo good. Getting into fantasy is really hard sometimes but this made it so easy. ⋆˙⟡♡╰┈➤PlotI think this book is a lot more plot focused than ACOMAF. They\'re dealing with strained political bonds with a devastating war on the horizon. It was so cool to see the other courts and all their personalities, how they all had their own stories that tie in with our main characters. As a certified romance hater, this was much more my style. There is stilla lotof romance to swoon for, between multiple characters and it was just *chef\'s kiss*.I will not stop talking about found family - these moments were responsible for me crying my eyes out.╰┈➤CharactersPersonally,Feyrewas a lot more likeable in this book. Less whining, more protective sister, protective family member. She\'s still not perfect and buts her nose into situations which I feel like she shouldn\'t, but it didn\'t make me dislike her, it\'s just a flaw. She has some very epic and real adventurous moments in this, and her anointment asHigh Lady of the Night Courtonly made me like her more.Rhysand, what a sweetheart. I love him to bits, he\'s soft on the inside but a bit of a powerful arrogant cheeky guy on the outside. He\'s sooooo sweet to Feyre and as someone who loveswords of affirmationI found him so loveable. He loves his family so deeply and that is represented further in this book. I loveCassianmore though. He\'s like a man man, also my style, but has a very soft spot for a girl. So adorable.BothNestaandElainmade me fall in love with them. They\'re so different, and they developed differently during this story, but the outcome was still the same. Nesta was starting to get on my nerves at one point because she\'s a bitice coldbut it grows on you, as it grows on a particular Illyrian warrior. I love the fact that they both have a special power that contributes to their overall adventure/mission. I\'m so excited to see them more in the next book. 𓍢ִ໋🌷͙֒╰┈➤World/SettingListen - this world was beautifully painted. The characters in this were painted so vividly, I could imagine each of them and they were all beautiful. As we see a lot more of the different courts, we see how different they are, both in attitude and visual representation, which was so well done. I could see Autumn court, Summer court, Winter court, Day & Dawn, and it\'s just so cool. I can\'t decide which one I would like to live in more, but I\'m leaning towards Winter.╰┈➤PacingSomething was always happening, there was always something to be interested in, laugh at, or cry at. There were some really tense moments at the ends of chapters that kept me hooked and this is a looooong book (703 pages). My ADHD struggled at times, but that doesn\'t reflect the story.╰┈➤EnjoymentAs you probably can tell, I enjoyed this so much. Like so so much. I felt the characters, was invested in the story, kept wanting to read it. Personally the story had everything I wanted, found family, epic battles and high stakes. So good.╔═════ ❀•°❀°•❀ ═════╗score card:plot: 5/5characters: 5/5world/setting: 5/5pacing: 5/5enjoyment: 5/5total: 5/5ੈ✩‧₊˚╚═════ ❀•°❀°•❀ ═════╝₊˚⊹♡ reading log09/05 9:30am ୨ৎgod damn I hate tamlin so much I hate the spring court so much what a sad sad man09/05 6:53am ୨ৎazriel and mor are positively killing me08/05 6:50am ୨ৎdid i get up at 6am to keep reading this? yes. is something awful about to go down in the story? yes.07/05 8:10pm ୨ৎi love this world, i love reading about these characters i love them all in their own unique way - but MAN this is long and my adhd cannot handle it - azriel is my favourite character so far, nesta\'s coldness is getting a little on my nerves but I\'m sure its for a reason07/05 4:31pm ୨ৎnesta be like 🥶🥶🥶05/05 8:35pm ୨ৎoh good i\'ve already cried, found family is my biggest weakness i can\'t05/05 6:44pm ୨ৎgod this book is long so much has happened and im only 13% of the way in05/05 12:02pm ୨ৎtamlin is stupid₊˚⊹♡ pre-readingit\'s tiimmeeeeee!! i\'ve been DYING to know how this is going to play out i\'m so excited the last one had me in an emotional ball on the floor - i expect nothing less from this one (although i know the second one is most people\'s favourite).i\'m so excited to see more of nesta and elain!! and of course everyone\'s favourite book boyfriend, rhysand.✦\u3000\u3000\u3000.\u3000\u3000. \u3000\u2008˚\u3000.\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 . ✦\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000˚\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 . ★⋆..\u2002\u2002 \u3000\u3000˚\u3000✭\u3000 \u3000\u3000*\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000✦\u3000\u3000\u3000.\u3000\u3000.\u3000\u3000\u3000✦\u3000˚ \u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u2008˚\u3000.˚\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000✭\u3000.\u3000\u3000. \u3000\u2008˚\u3000.\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 ✦may tbr:ಇ.salt to the seaಇ. powerlessಇ. house of earth and bloodಇ. everyone in my family has killed someoneಇ. brideಇ. listen for the lieಇ. she\'s not sorryಇ. love on the brainಇ. the familiarಇ.a court of wings and ruin'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""symptoms - sweaty palms, increased heart rate, calling everyone'mate.'diagnosis - rhysand withdrawals.treatment - rereading this book.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'A Court of Wings and Ruinis the third book in the ACOTAR series by Sarah J. Maas, and it\'s wild. The book starts with Feyre spying on the Spring Court for Rhys, pretending to be Tamlin\'s faithful wife again so she can undermine his Court from the inside.I absolutely adored the first part of the book. I love how clever Feyre was, setting up the destruction of the Spring Court while no one knew what she was planning. The way she tricked Tamlin was gold.After she returns to the Night Court, war breaks out between Hybern and Prythian. She goes on a quest to find the Cauldron, an ancient source of magic that might just stop the war. But not all of the Courts are willing to help her, and she will have to call on other magical creatures and forces to aid her in her search.I didn\'t like this part of the book as much. It felt very aimless to me, and drawn out for so long that the plot points lost all meaning. I wasn\'t bored, exactly, but the plot just feltwrongto me, as if something were missing. It was pretty straightforward in the beginning—find the Cauldron, destroy Hybern—but then a bunch of subplots were introduced. Feyre had to make deals with spirits and gods, she had to avoid Hybern—it was just... a lot, and yet too little at the same time. What do I mean by ""too little?"" Well...The pacing was dreadful. That doesn\'t mean I was bored.The plot built up far too quickly. Unlike inThrone of Glass,where the plot built gradually and climaxed in KoA, the plot here came out of nowhere. The villain, the King of Hybern, was so one-dimensional and uninteresting. His motives didn\'t make sense, the little history that was thrown in was so random and didn\'t help make him a better character at all, and his death was so unsatisfying. The character who killed him... well, I\'m not going to spoil it, but I don\'t think they were the right character to do the job. See the spoilery section for more on that.This series would have been better as just a regular romance, without all this...plot.I only really cared about the Inner Circle anyway. If it were just a faerie romance with great side characters and a found family, I would. Not. Care. That\'s all I want. Adding a whole epic plotline to the story just drags it down. I much preferred the more introspective ACOMAF.I really, really loved Feyre in ACOMAF, and now? Not so much. She has too many powers. She can do everything the High Lords can and more. I love how she\'s the first High Lady, but honestly, she has every power and it gets annoying when she can do basically anything.However, there are still times when I like Feyre more than Aelin. She\'s more mild and less overbearing, and I like that in a protagonist. She\'s persistent when she needs to be, and determined to learn. She understands the meaning of responsibility.Rhys before the mating bond is superior to Rhys after the mating bond. For one, he was less protective in the beginning of ACOMAF versus ACOWAR. I\'m tired of overprotective, aggressive male characters. I miss the Rhysand of ACOMAF, the one with a sharp sense of humor and patient respect for Feyre. He still has some of the traits he exhibited earlier, but they\'re dimmed in the face of his overpoweringmaleness that can sometimes turn into toxic masculinity. Thank you, next.🚨🚨🚨SPOILERS AHEAD, PROCEED WITH CAUTION🚨🚨🚨Elain killed the King of Hybern and I am angry.She\'s incapable of doing anything useful and everyone, including the other characters, consistently forgets she exists. How am I supposed to believe she sneaked up behind the big baddie and stabbed him? How is she the hero here? Okay, maybe this is her big moment, when she overcomes her fear and does something awesome, but... where\'s the buildup?I have a theory that NoBrain Elain is actually whip-smart and pretends to be meek and helpless just to manipulate everyone around her. And I have evidence.1. One of Elain\'s only lines of dialogue is, ""I hope they all burn in hell."" And everyone is shocked because she likes gardens and flowers and she hardly ever talks so they all think she\'s weak. But what if this is just Elain\'s true side showing through?2. She holds all of the characters in the palm of her hand. Nesta is obsessed with protecting her. Azriel is in love with her. Feyre will do anything to save her when she gets captured, and so Rhys likes her too just because Feyre does. They risked all of their lives just to sneak into Hybern\'s camp and save her, despite the fact that she has done nothing useful this entire book. What if she\'s manipulating them all, using them for her own gain?That\'s my wild theory. Have fun with it.At the end of the book, Amren sacrifices herself to destroy Hybern. This had the potential to be a really powerful, touching moment. But no. She got brought back from the dead because no one EVER dies in fantasy books. And this makes me mad. Her sacrifice lost all of its pain because there were literally no consequences.🚨🚨🚨SPOILERS HAVE ENDED🚨🚨🚨NoBrain ElainWritten by SofiaNoBrain Elain puts me in painHer stupid shenanigans make me mad againShe\'s a pointless character who does nothingBut add to my unending sufferingShe never talks, but everyone loves herMaybe it\'s trauma, but I still sufferShe gets into trouble and everyone criesI just smile and hope she diesShe belongs with Tamlin, that much is trueIf she ends with Azriel, I will sueNesta may be angering, but at least she\'s not thisI would banish Elain from this earth with my last wishElain, ElainNoBrain ElainNobody cares about your painThis may sound harsh, but rest assuredThe whole book community thinks you\'re absurd3.5 starsACOTAR reviewACOMAF reviewcredit'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'You know you\'re a dedicated fan when you mark an untitled book set to release in 2017 as a ""want to read"".

Maaswiped that sneer off my face and proved me wrong. Again.A Court of Wings and Ruinis a work of art that will make you run out of proper adjectives to describe all the pandemonium, magic and apocalypse it entails. The kind that will pull at your heartstrings right from the get-go and hold you with its sharp claws, imploring you to devour it.Intense action, delicious romance, backstabbing, ferociously deadly creatures, raw brutality, lies and disguise are all ornately woven into a tale that will cocoon you into the Fae world and soothe you, leaving you anchored by nothing but a tempest in your lungs.There was darkness and light, storm and calm, despair but also hope. You will see battles mired with savagery and viciousness, harsh and regrettable decisions and nerve-wracking adventures in a world where humans are perceived as weak and easily destroyable.Sarah J. Maas's world building is so exquisite that I felt detached from my own body, incapable of focusing on anything else happening around me, only flipping the pages with an acute yearning of what's about to happen. She delivers plenty of magic and mayhem, with a knack for perfect pacing of the story and character reflection.CharactersThe Inner Circle, my favourite squad ❤I love their devotion to each other. Their ability to be kind in spite of harsh circumstances, their ability to love despite enduring a millenia of cruelty. They're all so full of light, it makes we want to smile and simultaneously tear up at their unconditional loyalty. I was so attached to them, like I was bound to them by an invisible, irrevocable tether. When they struggled, I struggled. When they were hurt, I was hurt. I could feel their rage, loyalty and honour coursing through my veins, like a shrieking void.High LordsI don't think I would have enjoyed this book at all if not for them. I'm glad thatSarah J. Maasshowed them in a new light, something readers haven't seen in the previous books.As amusing as their banter was, I also feel deeply moved by their actions, their unwavering faith in one another during the battle despite their iffy past.Be itHelion,the Spell Cleaver;Thesan,the healer;Tarquin,the sympathetic and thoughtful leader;Kallias,the snow/ice manipulator andBeron,..... Never mind, I didn't really like him; I loved them with every echoing heartbeat. (Beron being the exception)\u200eOh andTamlin. I apologise if I've been harsh to him after readingA Court of Mist and Fury, but I have a new found respect for him. Despite his impropriety initially, the fact that he finally rises to be a better man by not dwelling on petty vengeance and retribution hit me in the gut and made my eyes burn with warm tears.WhereA Court of Mist and Furywas romance heavy (not that I'm complaining),A Court of Wings and Ruinwas action-packed and was cluttered with twists and magical intrigue and SJM definitely didn't let the romance aspect of the book obliterate the subplot, deftly exploring all the details.I feel weighed down by the intensity of this composition and I vow never to let it slip even from the deepest clutches of my mind ❤""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '4.75!""Night Triumphant- and the Stars Eternal.”I might be in the minority here but I liked ACOWAR more than ACOMAF but this has only happened during this reread before this reread the four times that I read this series I always preferred ACOMAF maybe because I loved the romance but reading this now really made me appreciate the plot and the politics in this book. This book was exactly 700 pages long and 700 pages have never felt this short because I actually flew through them and despite rereading this series every year there were still moments where I forgot certain things happen and the plot twists surprised me as well, the way it was written made it very easy to read a 700 paged book.“I see all of you, Rhys. And there is not one part that I do not love with everything I am.”FeyreI feel like Feyre is very underrated, her cunningness is overshadowed a lot by the fandom because of how compassionate she is because in this because people really rave about how cunning she was and how she made a fool out of the spring court and hey, believe me I loved that scene to probably me best part in this book but then I looked back and saw that Feyre has always been this clever and she made it till this book because of how smart she was and I just feel like its very underappreciated. I love her.“You do not fear... You do not falter. You do not yield.”RhysandI really like Rhys\'s character bur he is probably my least favorite bat boy lol. I liked him, he made rash decisions some I understood, some I did not but in the end it all worked out well. I love how cocky he was and how he presented himself with this calm composure and IDGAF attitude and I also like how he was actually nice and not a total bitch, how he helped everyone and would do anything for the people he loved. The romance between Feyre and Rhys was good as well and I liked how well it was managed in the span of three books.“We\'re all a broken, in our own ways - In places no one might see.”The Inner CircleAmren as always was the character I loved and my heart was beating so fast during those final pages because if ykyk, Cassian, him and Nesta in this book ATE and I loved him. Mor, I was justice for her, I need answers, I love her but I also want to know more about her because we only know bits and pieces about her past and nothing more and finally Azriel, I love that man so much, everything that he said and did was beautiful.“Only you can decide what breaks you, Cursebreaker. Only you.”I think the plot, the entire build up and how it all paid off was really well done and the action sequences were also detailed and really well written, The court intrigue was also something I appreciated. Especially that highlords meeting (prolly my favorite scene) and the bargains that were made, the satisfying endings that we got, the reunions and all of the massive forces aligning together with twists that you won\'t see coming and it was just really good as for the world building I am stunned how it still grew and morphed into something more beautiful.Overall, a really solid conclusion to this series and while tog remains superior, this series will have a special place in my heart!!____Listening to the graphic audio just so I can hear the loml Az say""Be careful of how you speak of my high lady""🤭Reread #4'}]"

Ormai a capo della segheria e punto di riferimento del clan, Miriam lavora instancabilmente per rendere i Caskey sempre più ricchi.Una scoperta sorprendente e miracolosa – eccetto che per una persona – distribuirà la ricchezza anche in città.

The characters aren't even that great. They're fully realized and fleshed out, but still very ordinary.

Lo mejor es dar tres pinceladas y contar lo mínimo. Os animo a adentraros en ella y descubrirla por vosotros mismos.En este quinto libro el ritmo narrativo es similar al del anterior. McDowell con pocos trazos y su maestría de siempre nos presenta el ambiente socio económico de la posguerra. Son años de bonanza. La guerra ha terminado. La recuperación económica que llegó de su mano se consolida. Los negocios de los Caskey se han convertido en causa y motor de la riqueza de Perdido. El pueblo, inmerso en su nueva prosperidad, ha olvidado los años de la depresión y las consecuencias de la riada de 1919. Los ríos Perdido y Blackwater llevan tres décadas fluyendo tranquilos. El mantenimiento del dique ya no es una prioridad para sus habitantes.En la familia Caskey, Elinor sigue siendo el eje. Sin detrimento de ello, la nueva generación va tomando el relevo. Miriam se revela como una mujer de negocios competente y sagaz. Su relación con su madre, sin ser cercana, se ha vuelto menos tensa. El carácter de Sister no va precisamente a mejor y el papel de Billy adquiere mayor importancia.Frances es el personaje, que más evoluciona en esta entrega. Algunas de las decisiones que toma están en consonancia con la trayectoria de materna de la familia, pero ese giro final no lo esperaba para nada.¿Y qué nos deparará el sexto?

La relación madre - hija aquí está muy patente y bien retratada, esa conexión entre ambas es única y traspasa el papel.También con su hija mayor; Miriam, veremos esa potente evolución, esas tensiones del pasado que parecen haberse limado.Y es que Miriam ha demostrado ser una gran mujer de negocios. Independiente y decidida.

No lo sé, pero tengo unas expectativas que espero que se cumplan.El título de esta entrega hace referencia a la fortuna material de la familia Caskey, y aunque es un tema que está muy bien tratado (sus finanzas y cómo hacerse más ricos), y explicado bastante claro, no es lo que más me ha gustado del libro. Además incluyo que aquí el personaje de Sister se me hace un poco cansino, llegando a estas alturas creo que es un pequeño bajón respecto a lo que veníamos viendo.Me gusta mucho que se centre tanto en los más jóvenes (no tanto ya) y sobre todo en Frances. El final me dejó muy loco y muy contento. ¿Por qué? Sentaos que os lo cuento:Uno que es un poco tonto, no lo puedo negar, estaba el otro día en un centro comercial y estaba ojeando libros. Como digo antes, a veces soy un poco tonto, y no tengo otra cosa que hacer que ojear el último volumen de la saga, y me encontré con una cosa que me dejó en shock. Por ese lado viene lo de loco. Pero pero pero, McDowell hace aquí una jugada maestra, y una doble pirueta, y eso es lo que me deja muy contento. El que sabe de lo que hablo, lo sabe.Para terminar dos cositas a comentar: El paso del tiempo en la propia trama a veces se acelera demasiado, y aquí tenemos un ejemplo claro de ello. Por contra, en el primer capítulo hay una lección magistral sobre el respeto y el trato a los demás, que escrito en 1983 daría de patadas a mucha gente hoy en día.Ya queda todo visto para sentencia, en nada el final.1.La riada⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐2.El dique⭐⭐⭐⭐3.La casa⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐4.La guerra⭐⭐⭐⭐5.La fortuna⭐⭐⭐⭐6.Lluvia⭐⭐⭐⭐💰🪙💴💵💶💷💰🪙💴💵💶💷💰🪙💴💵💶💷This is almost over, and I am completely immersed (wink wink) in the story, who could have told me that I would like reading about the daily life of a family in the first half of the 20th century so much. But here we go: volume 5 of this saga, all the pieces are now in place for the final play. How will it end? I don't know, but I have some expectations that I hope are met.The title of this installment refers to the material fortune of the Caskey family, and although it is a topic that is very well covered (their finances and how to get richer), and explained quite clearly, it is not what I liked most about it. I also include that here Sister's character is a little tiring to me, at this point I think she is a slight letdown compared to what we have been seeing.I really like that it focuses so much on the youngest (not so much anymore) and especially on Frances. The ending left me very upset and very happy. Because? Sit down and I'll tell you:One who is a bit silly, I can't deny it, I was in a shopping mall the other day and was looking through books. As I say before, sometimes I'm a bit stupid, and I had nothing else to do but look through the last volume of the saga, and I found something that shocked me. That's where the very upset part comes from. But but but, McDowell makes a master move here, and a double pirouette, and that is what makes me very happy. Those of you who knows what I'm talking about, you know.Lastly, two things to comment on: The passage of time in the plot itself sometimes speeds up too much, and here we have a clear example of this. On the other hand, in the first chapter there is a master lesson on respect and treatment of others, which written in 1983 would kick in the back many people today.Everything has been seen for the sentence, the end is near.1.The flood⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐2.The levee⭐⭐⭐⭐3.The house⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐4.The War⭐⭐⭐⭐5.The Fortune⭐⭐⭐⭐6.Rain⭐⭐⭐⭐""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Nel penultimo capitolo della storia dei Caskey si ha un impronta horror più accentuata, data soprattutto dal personaggio di Frances.

Lejano parecía el desenlace cuando cogí por primera vez la primera entrega “La Riada”, y que inminente es ahora mismo todo.La vida sigue para los miembros del Clan Caskey en Perdido con su inevitable flujo de defunciones y nacimientos. Y ahora, además, la familia está en un momento económico brillante como nunca antes habían vivido sus miembros, debido a la administración de Billy Bronze y al empuje de Miriam para que las tierras pantanosas e inútiles que posee la familia sean explotadas en búsqueda de petróleo, gracias a las predicciones de Elinor. Pero ahora que parece que la riqueza y la paz se ha instalado entre los Caskey, el oscuro secreto de algunos de sus miembros, empieza a salir a la superficie. Porque se pueden esconder muchas cosas, pero nunca la autentica naturaleza de uno.La gente suele decir que el tercer tomo de la saga, “La Casa” es el mejor de toda la hexalogía. Pero en mi humilde opinión, este quinto volumen, llamado muy acertadamente “La Fortuna”, me ha parecido el mejor de los que llevo leídos de “Blackwater”. Por lo menos creo que es el que más he disfrutado leer. Y es que siento que todos los elementos que se nos han presentado en las cuatro novelas anteriores están aquí muy bien equilibrados. Si habéis leído mi reseñas anteriores de estos libros, habréis comprobado que mi gran queja es que en ellos siento que los sobrenatural no ha tenido tanta importancia como te lo venden en otras reseñas o en la propia publicidad que la editorial ha preparado. Más bien, toda la historia me ha parecido una crónica familiar llena de intereses económicos, mujeres, de carácter enfrentadas entre ellas, engaños y tejemanejes varios y relaciones complicadas. Sazonada con un poquito de fantasía y muchas dosis de misterio y de tensión, todo hay que decirlo, las cuales dan mucho juego. Pero en este quinto volumen he percibido que los intereses y movimientos familiares están a la misma altura que el misterio que envuelve a dos de los miembros de la familia Caskey. Una de ellas (estoy intentando hacer los spoilers mínimos de la lectura, y la verdad es que me está costando mucho) ganará un peso muy importante entre estas páginas, y de su mano vendrán algunos giros de corte místico, que la verdad es que impresionan mientras los lees y te dejan con ganas de continuar con la historia. Y siento que al incidir más en este aspecto, la historia ha ganado más capas al permitirse al lector descubrir más datos y más cosas de uno de los temas más importantes de esta novela río, y al darle más protagonismo, que ya era hora después de cuatro novelas. En “La Fortuna” he encontrado más plenamente que nunca lo que esperaba cuando empecé a leer Blackwater y me dejé llevar por el Boom editorial que ha supuesto en España y en las redes sociales enfocadas en literatura.Por cierto, no me escondo y admito que mi personaje favorito de toda la historia es Miriam, que me parece una reina y de los que mejor esbozados están.Además, siento que todos los personajes que han poblado estas páginas, y con los que reconozco que no he podido evitar encariñarme, tienen la misma importancia unos con otros. Y eso es muy de agradecer en esta historia tan coral. No obstante, a estas alturas del partido, creo que ya es inevitable reconocer que tampoco es que sean personajes con mucha profundidad y capas. Tampoco me parece algo que sea especialmente frustrante por el tipo de literatura que nos presenta Michael McDowell, más enfocada en el entretenimiento y el misterio. Esto no quiere decir que los personajes estén mal enfocados o resulten indiferentes al lector, porque la verdad es que en pocas pinceladas uno acaba reconociéndoles como si fueran miembros de su propia familia. Pero en muchos de ellos me falta que se adonde más en su forma de ser. Lo mismo puedo decir a grandes rasgos de la historia, siento que hay momentos en los que me ha faltado mayor tratamiento y lentitud, que se incidiese más en ciertos hechos que solo se comentan de una manera muy somera.“La Fortuna” es, probablemente, de todos los tomos, el que tiene el nombre más acertado, como he señalado antes. No solo se refiere a la riquezas desmesuradas que los Caskey consiguen entre sus páginas, también se refiere a la gran cantidad de descubrimientos y de hilos sueltos que se entretejen en esta entrega. No sé si se deberá a que soy consciente de que al final está cerca, pero para mí ahora mismo la historia tiene una hora inmensa de decadencia. Uno siente que toda la paz y bonanza de los Caskey son demasiados buenos como para que perduren. Esa felicidad tiene algo de frágil, y es imposible no sentir de alguna forma que la desgracia acecha a este Clan en la siguiente entrega, como si todo lo que han conseguido durante todos estos años fuera a irse flotando junto a las tumultuosas y rojas aguas del río Perdido y las negras del Blackwater. Este aire de pérdida predestinada que se mascara bajo el aparente éxito y la paz. Entre sus miembros, tiene un olor pútrido que solo aumenta la oscuridad que siempre ha tenido esta historia .No sé si esto se cumplirá, solo que me pongo inmediatamente a leer ya el último tomo. Porque si algo le he reconocido a Michael McDowell el minuto uno, que es un autor que sabe perfectamente lo que hace, y ha manejado los hilos de la historia con gran eficaz.

In primis Elinor e Frances con la loro natura non umana, ma anche Miriam con il suo temperamento anaffettivo o Grace e Lucille con la loro scelta di vita.Quello che ho apprezzato maggiormente è proprio il non voler categorizzare i personaggi, a partire da Grace la cui identità sessuale non viene mai dichiarata espressamente, eppure il lettore ne diventa consapevole senza rendersene conto.È una saga in continua evoluzione, è iniziata in un modo e ha preso strade diverse ogni volta, tant'è che trovo difficile classificarla in un genere specifico.

Ancora una volta, in Blackwater tutto è architettato all’insegna del disattendere le aspettative, e questo pezzo di storia ne è un esempio lampante.La situazione viene avviata con allusioni che fanno ipotizzare che Frances, diventando madre di due gemelle, rifiuterà la figlia con caratteristiche mostruose, per fare da madre solo all’altra. E inizialmente sembra davvero così. Ci si aspetta dunque che sia Elinor a occuparsi della bambina-pesce, come profetizzato quando Elinor stessa parlava di sottrarre una figlia a Frances.Poi però gradualmente la situazione subisce un’inversione completa. Il bello della scrittura di McDowell secondo me affiora da questo tipo di operazioni, che non sono sfacciate ma anzi, fanno agire le trasformazioni in maniera graduale. Crea la possibilità di un’aderenza emotiva in noi che leggiamo, perché ci fa immedesimare con sensibilità, e lo fa con grande eleganza perché non sono passaggi telefonatissimi.Alla fine, la storia della maternità diventa la storia di Frances che abbraccia a tal punto la sua seconda natura di mostro acquatico da dover rinunciare a quella umana che sembrava dominante. Frances non è più davvero presente, quando è costretta a restare fuori dalle acque. Il mondo fluviale, che prima la spaventava, le diventa sempre più familiare attraverso la presenza della figlia-pesce. Frances si cala in questa alterità fino a desiderare di esistere solo in quel modo. Il suo mondo ordinario, tradizionale e normato, diventa una gabbia insopportabile, in quella che mi sembra molto prossima a una metafora di queerness, nel modo più esplicito proposto dall’intera saga. Alla fine Frances rinuncia alla sua identità “normale” perché quella seconda natura non era davvero “seconda”. C’è come un funerale simbolico per la persona che è stata, di cui viene annunciata la metaforica morte nel fiume, in cui in realtà si ritira per vivere con la figlia che sente più vicina.Riguardo alle altre trame, ci sono vari twist sempre basati sul disattendere le aspettative. Quello più importante per il senso del romanzo riguarda l’endgame della stessa Elinor, che sembra diventare un po’ più chiaro.Infatti, quello che all’inizio mi era sembrato uno spunto di ecofiction su Elinor come guardiana del fiume Perdido e della sua sorgente, viene svelato più o meno come il suo esatto contrario. Avevo spesso pensato che fosse strano il titolo “Blackwater”, visto che il fiume principale non è quello chiamato così, ma il Perdido. Secondo me è il quinto volume a fornire un nuovo senso al titolo: il “nero” importante per queste acque si rivela quello del petrolio.Elinor non ha fatto comprare tutti quei terreni alla famiglia Caskey per proteggere la sua sorgente, ma perché sa che sul fondo delle paludi c’è il petrolio. La ninfa-mostro acquatico Elinor sembra aver fatto tutto quello che ha fatto per portare le trivelle nella sua natura incontaminata e far diventare ricchissima la famiglia in cui si è inserita. Ecco, questo è davvero un colpo di scena che non avevo visto arrivare.Come predetto dal titolo del volume “La fortuna”, la cui aspettativa per ora non è stata disattesa, anche questo capitolo parla della prosperità dei capitalisti Caskey negli anni che seguono la liberazione dalla matriarca tradizionalista Mary Love. La loro intraprendenza finanziaria è stata importata dalla ninfa Elinor, e grazie a essa il clan diventa ricchissimo.Il matriarcato fondato da Mary Love non viene distrutto dopo la sua morte, ma si evolve in uno ancora più prospero. I legami importanti rimangono quelli femminili. Sono a volte romantici come nel caso di Grace e Lucille, ma sono soprattutto quelli di amicizia e familiarità, di “kinship”, e riguardano in qualche modo tutti i personaggi femminili: Sister e Queenie, Sister e Miriam, Miriam e Elinor, Elinor e Frances, e così via.Rimane tutto confinato nel suprematismo bianco, purtroppo, con le domestiche nere relegate a eterne serve che esistono unicamente in funzione del benessere dei Caskey, come se fossero di loro proprietà. Non è per attaccare la saga, però è indiscutibile che questa componente ci sia e che l’autore non avesse particolarmente voglia di provare a sovvertirla. Rientra in quegli aspetti che sarebbero irricevibili se la saga dovesse essere pubblicata di sana pianta oggi, nel senso che non sarebbero nemmeno accettati dall’editore in prima battuta.Nel complesso, del volume 5 mi è piaciuto molto tutto quello che riguarda la storia di Frances, mentre ho trovato in generale il volume un po’ più vuoto e sottotono rispetto al resto della saga. Forse si inizia a sentire la fatica di una narrazione così lunga, che suona sempre più ripetitiva quando non produce delle svolte significative. Penso anche che il vuoto lasciato dall’antagonismo di Mary Love in qualche maniera avrebbe avuto bisogno di una compensazione; il volume 4 è originale proprio perché non la crea, però nel 5 sarebbe stato meglio trovare una soluzione (non è sufficiente la macchiettistica trasformazione di Sister).'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Probablemente el libro donde la historia se sacude la modorra y pasan cosasssss...No entendí mucho algunos cambios rotundos de actitud y diría que hasta de personalidad en algunos de los protagonistas, pero ya no me importa, ese cliffhanger lo es todo...y tengo que leer el último.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""La fin de la saga approche...Toujours autant de plaisir (et de frénésie) à lire les aventures des Caskey, avec des personnages qui changent un peu, qu'on apprécie plus, qui nous surprennent aussi, et une bien trop bonne fortune pour que tout ceci se termine bien.Hâte de découvrir comment la saga va se terminer !""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Nel quinto volume i Caskey crescono economicamente, tanto che ciascuno di loro è scandalosamente ricco.

(and the morally-grey part but i’ll get to that)lauren said powerless was“if the child of the hunger games and red queen didn't look anything like its parents.”…see, if that were true, then this review wouldn’t exist.(and i know i’m the myopic bitch of the prime meridian, but this was exactly like it’s parents, as well shatter me and the selection)in fact, i was so angry about it, that i made a whole list. and then other people helped me add more to the list, and then, i realised that this wasn’t really an unpopular opinion at all.but before i get into all the ways this book was unoriginal, i’m going to criticise everything else. and if you don’t want to read about that,then scroll away.do not throw a tantrum in the comment section because someone expressed their criticisms about a book that you enjoyed. it’s incredibly immature, and quite franklyhilariousstupid because you’re wasting your time writing a comment that i’m just going to deleteafter screenshotting it and sending it on the group chat.anyway, let’s talk about something that actually wasn’t criticised that much: the writing.for a debut novel, it wasn’t that bad. for a book hyped up to the point where it could be mistaken as the greatest literary masterpiece this generation could ever bear witness to, it was trash.it read like an unedited draft that was both half-finished and yet too long at the same time, with the typos only making it worse. every sentence was so long-winded with synonyms upon synonyms being thrown into one sentence so whilst it might sound like this deeply thought-out didactic monologue about how inflation has affected the economy to the point that shakespeare's sonnets are no longer analysed correctly, it’s really just a horny teenage boy trying to sound edgy.and serious question: have recent authors heard of show not tell? i am not an idiot incapable of coming to my own conclusions, thank you very much. i don’t need to be told about just how morally questionable princekrabskai is, when i should just be able toinferfrom what the authorimplies. except the author didn't imply anything, for fuck's sake this dude barely killed anyone.on top of that, the sheer amount of times i read “blue eyes”, “smoky eyes”, “ocean eyes” was enough to put me off reading forever. billie eilish is crying through her “aquamarine orbs” right now. and the amount of times these characters were huffing and puffing - for the love of all that is holy, use!!an!!inhaler!! someone’s lips were always twitching into a smile, or someone was snorting/ chuckling/ blinking/ eyeing something or someone, or paedyn was being called “vicious little thing” by kai - which only succeeded in me receiving fourth wing flashbacks. kai was always flicking paedyn’s nose for no given reason, and one or the other was constantly in a “throng of people”. plus, the inner monologues were also the most repetitive things i have ever read which really helped make the book incredibly long and boring, with the pacing losing to a snail in a 500m run. it’s filled with so much banter and such eye-rolling dialogue that after a certain point, you begin to wonder how on earth the mcs would cope without hearing themselves speak, as well as so many trope-centred and pointless scenes.if you don’t believe me yet, screw you and read this list of tropes:knife/dagger/arrow to the throat (every other page), enemies to lovers (not on a single page), insta lust, slow burn, who did this to you, she's so smol, forbidden romance, cleaning each other’s wounds, comforting after a nightmare, the most unnecessary love triangle (only one love interest has a pov), some stupid trials that have no history and don’t even make sense, and the street thief trope (cue the eyeroll - i’m probably an outlier on this one, but i just hate how much the street thief trope has been overused. there was no way paedyn would have survived a day on the streets with the amount of stupid shit that she pulled. did no one notice her wonderfully-amazing-most-gorgeous-beautiful-stunning-oh-so-rare-never-seen-before hair colour while she was off pickpocketing the rich? i’m very sure no one did, seeing as it wasn’t mentioned on every.other.page.)now it's time for more stupid things.. so many stupid things. so many. and i’ve actually missed a lot so if you can remember anything i’m missing please let me know <3➳ a trained soldier is dancing in the middle of a deathly arena because he likes a girl -

me - as the greatest piece of dog sh*t that was dropped into this world), the darkest mind series (i’ve never read it), and the jasad heir (i enjoyed it). if you don’t want to be spoiled (although not all the similarities are spoilers, i just couldn't be asked to mark the ones that are) then you can skip to the bottom of this review where you will see a funny gif i found that pretty much sums up my personal experience with powerless.update:there is now a bonus section at the end (before the funny gif) with books that are similar/give the same vibes as powerless. note: i have not read all of these so please don't kill me if i'm wrong about any. if you have any info you want me to add then leave me a comment/dmyes, i realise that i have missed out on so many herethe selection:➳illéailya➳ a girl from the slums and from an undesirable position in society that rose up in the ranks➳ our fmc has different colour dress to everyone else➳ all the scenes where they're eating food➳ the queen likes the dancing in the balls➳ the balls➳ the safe room stuff that i’m not asked to go into detail about➳ the girl on girl hate -

i was rooting for her so hard. it was refreshing to see a fmc that didn’t have magic or special powers and had to rely on her wits to stay alive. she was an incredibly written character — the overlooked girl who constantly had to fight for what she has. her strength, wit, determination and preservation was just so admirable. getting to see her development and overcome so many obstacles was so lovely to read about. she is one of the best fmcs i have read about in a while!! she is the embodiment of “don’t underestimate the underdog.” watching her prove everyone wrong was so fun to read about, she always found a way to conquer a situation and be powerful in her own way. but girly was way stronger than me. constantly pulling away from someone you want is baffling to me, especially since it’s kai like girl that man is obsessed with you!!➳kai:the prince of Ilya and the king’s future enforcer hunts those like paedyn and kills them, yet pae somehow convinces him she’s a mundane, an elite who has a lesser power. kai has the ability to sense and use other elites powers and though he can’t sense pae’s “psychic” ability he goes along with it. from there we get to witness their palpable chemistry and snarky banter. aaa he is everything n more, i can’t get over him. this man just has a way with words. the way i was giggling like a little girl, blushing, twirling my hair and kicking my feet every time he spoke. kai was a complex character, and his struggle for redemption was interesting to read about despite who he had become. but he was just so sweet, charming, tortured, swoony, witty and perfect. when he braided her hair and called her “my pretty pae” I COMPLETELY LOST IT. I NEED HIM BIBLICALLY. the way he was so down bad for pae?? he was smitten with her from the very beginning — for him, she is the only girl in the room. the fact that he knew her capabilities and gave ‘that’s my girl’ vibes rather than forcing her into protection and hiding her away from the world. seriously, how can you not love him!!— what was the authors fascination with the characters fkn eye colour. like seriously take a shot every time you read “ocean eyes” and “grey eyes” (spoiler you will probably die from alcohol poisoning) like pls stfu about his grey eyes and her ocean eyes, i got it the first 10 times you said it and also pae constantly going on about kitt’s green eyes omg pls free me, enough is enough!! 😭➷ the slow burn is absolutely top tier, it worked so perfectly for the setting and the plot. how the author built up this fiery and heated chemistry between the mcs despite them not even sharing a single kiss was just so immaculate 😮\u200d💨 the banter and the tension was incredible, i just love the combination of a “who did this to you” boy meets “i will stab you” / “why do you care” girl. the banter and tension was good but their sweet and vulnerable moments together were even better. seriously the romance is just incredible, the way both characters navigate their own storyline but are so heavily intertwined at the same time, it was all consuming in the best possible way. the tension, knife to throat scenes, the longing stares, the lingering touches, the dance scenes, the yearning, the banter & flirty conversations is etched into my memory!!”mark my words, prince, i will be your undoing.” i lean in, ignoring the knife against my throat as i murmur, “oh, darling, i look forward to it.”— this book is marketed as “enemies to lovers” but it’s definitely more of an instant attraction as they were both captivated with one another from the very beginning. kitt (kai’s brother) and pae would be a true enemies to lovers since she didn’t like him bc of who he constantly reminded her of.— the world-building wasn’t the best and very much lacking as there wasn’t much description and depth and there was many repetitive phrases throughout this book but as this was a debut novel i’m not going to make any judgements on that as i didn’t mind and i didn’t expect this book to be perfect.this book was very fast paced which i appreciated since a lot of fantasy books tend to be slow at times. the world is easy to understand so this book is great for those who are new to fantasy books. the beginning was rocky for me but once i was into it i was really into it - you do get easily engaged and immersed, mainly because the romance is worth it. i felt so much devastation as i was reading the last few chapters. there was so much action, so much emotion and so many reveals. the author done an amazing job setting up book two because there is still so much left unsaid — I SERIOUSLY NEED THAT BOOK RN!!'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4 stars\'Who did this to you\'BOY\'why do you care\'GIRL.This book is literally a romcom with action scenes in it! It was not screaming FANTASY much, but I still enjoyed it a lot! This story was quite interesting, and I can\'t compare it withHunger Gamesbecause I haven\'t read that series, but it gave meShatter Mevibes (as in powers and some scenes).•Kingdom of Ilya is divided into two types of groups, ELITES (with powers) and ORDINARIES (powerless).Elites were gifted with different powers because of a PLAGUE, and the ordinaries were banished from the Kingdom because they\'re rumored to lessen the powers of the elites!The plot was plotting and IT WAS SO GOOD 😌 though, this book had a lot of repetition (flirting and banter), and was def tropey, it is still SO CUTE! The ending was so angsty, and I DAMN WELL KNOW THAT THE NEXT BOOK IS GONNA BE FULL OF ANGST!😭Kai Azer— PRINCE WHO KILLS PEOPLE WITH NO POWER, BUT IS OBSESSED WITH THE GIRL WHO\'S POWERLESS!!!!! What else do you want??? He\'s so hot for fuck\'s sake! 😭Dark hairs, Gray eyes with loose black shirts, cocky smirk AND DIMPLES.😮\u200d💨The reason this was more rom-com type to me because he was so flirty! He was so gentle and sweet with her. He so selflessly helped her so many times without caring about himself and constantly teased and had fun with her.like letting her pin him with a dagger to the throat, silently asking permission to touch her, braiding her hair, dancing with her, doing anything to protect her life, counting her freckles, stayed awake whole night just to watch her and being affected with just her putting her finger on him! jakshsjssb 😭😭 and...... HE WROTE ON HIS HAND ""she said I can touch her when I\'m sober"" WHEN HE WAS DRUNK 😭🧎\u200d♀️His character was kinda givingAaron Warnervibes because HE\'S A FREAKING WIELDER (he can wield anyone\'s power if they are near) also MAJOR DADDY ISSUES 👺Paedyn Gray— I\'m sorry but EW NAME 💀 She was cool, the way her fighting is described is amazing, and it was easy to imagine! How she fought and no doubt she was pretty strong and amazing on the fighting aspect and how she was trained so perfectly. Her backstory and all didn\'t quite hit me much just like Kai\'s.❝Promise me you’ll stay alive long enough to stab me in the back?❞yes she will LITERALLY and FIGURATIVELY! 👺She has both the prince (Kai and his brother - kitt) wrapped around her finger.THEY BOTH ARE SO SMITTEN 😭, and she was also trying to make Kai her enemy in the start, and ngl prettyyy forced, but glad they lost sight of that lol! I\'m so glad she wasn\'t horny and was pretty annoyed with Kai and wanted nothing with him! Her being attracted to him didn\'t happen quickly, rather it developed slowly but nicely.I won\'t say that her wearing a different color to a ball (where everyone wore green) was pick meHermione Grangervibes lol, but it was definitely cool of her though! Also, SHE\'S THE MAIN CHARACTER SO LET HER SHINE!Her saying \'Gonna stab you in the heart\' was literally the 288262th time. She\'sVicious little thingas he called her. (reminded me of Violet)❝They chose me to die. And all because I saved that prick of a prince.❞•Pae is a thief, and she robbed Kai when he visited the town, and Kai was drawn to her because of the fact that he couldn\'t sense any power from her.Then she saved Kai from a Silencer (one who diminishes power), She caught the eye of everyone as the silver savior, and got selected for Purging Trials — where different trials are taken place for an elite to win. And this year, Kai is a part of them! Now she has to figure out how to SURVIVE because she\'s without power.The whole trials plot was good, but everything was a bit descriptive, and the story was falling into repetition (flirting, banter, and fluff only), and the trials were interesting, but the pace of each of them was different. One taking a lot of chapters, and the other ending in just 3.Many errors in it so the author should def change her editorotherwise everything was fine.

OH MY GOSH~•~•~That ending hurt. A lot.*deep breath* Okay let\'s get started with the review.I absolutely adored this book.The world created is so mesmerizing. The characters and storyline are so compelling. Both the leads- Paedyn and Kai are lovable. I\'ll be honest, this book is not perfect but I enjoyed it regardless.✔️ Magic system✔️ Forbidden romance✔️ Angsty slow burn✔️ Mutual pining✔️ Knife to the throat✔️ Tending to scars✔️ ""Who did this to you?""✔️ He kills for herThe book imostarts off a tad slowbut it\'s completely understandable as we are getting to know the world, the fantasy elements and the characters. It picks up pace towards the middle and stays consistent.An issue I had with this book and which is why it wasn\'t a perfect read for me is the fact that it reminded me TOO MUCH of The Hunger Games.I appreciate when authors take inspiration from a book and make something new with it but the first half of this book was a bit too much replication. This is not to damper anyone\'s expectations but rather give a realistic approach. I still enjoyed it quite a lot which you can see from my updates but it would have been perfect had this issue not existed.I absolutely LOVED the charactersand the complexities that came with them. Kai and Paedyn were imperfectly perfect. They have so much depth and life to them, it was hard to resist them.Kaiis going straight to my book boyfriends list. The man is capable of making me swoon and feel things by merely saying a few words and they don\'t even have to be romantic. He radiates such energy, charisma, and obviously his powers intrigues me a lot. The way he is so smitten with Pae is everything. For him, she is the only girl in the room. For him, she is his and he\'ll do anything to keep her alive and safe.Paedynis no less. She is fierce, equally charismatic and full of zeal and the woman knows how much power she holds in her flirtations, touches over Kai. Her confidence and the ability to stay strong is so impressive. I loved how she holds her own. She tried so hard to resist the charms of the prince and yet found herself wanting him more and I absolutely loved it.The romance is deliciously angsty and slow burning.I get some people are on the surface cause it\'s YA and don\'t really want to give it a go cause of that but believe me you\'re gonna be missing out on the beauty of these two and their intense chemistry. I didn\'t find myself yearning for spice, everything about these two hit perfectly and I wouldn\'t change a thing about it at all.The side characters,Kittin particular, are deeply complex. I saw him destined to become the king that he did at the end, from the beginning. It didn\'t come as a surprise. I found myself sympathizing with him and Kai more so for Pae. I don\'t mind Kitt becoming someone he wasn\'t meant to be, it\'s going to make things immensely interesting. Jax and A were my other favourites.The ending was predictable imo.I saw it coming ages ago so although I wasn\'t completely shocked, it was still impactful and made me excited to read the next one.Overall, an enjoyable read and one I absolutely love. It has the potential of becoming my favorite series but will see how the next books go 😉 What y\'all waiting for? Give it a read!!Like Powerless? Read these-1. The Hunger Games2.

LET\'S GOOO'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'dnf p.308do you ever have the feeling while reading that a book is trying too hard to be something it isn’t?to phrase it simply\'powerless\'has zero originally in it. the book is a replica of many popular books, such asThe Hunger Games, butmake it a cheap and bland AliExpress version. it consisted of recycled scenes jam-packed with tropes that the author was unable to mold to enhance and improve the storyline with. In the end, it appeared that she desperately attempted to sew and combine multiple clichéd scenes to force the protagonists to be in a sort of forced proximity. & it simply did not blend well because the final patchwork felt everything but spontaneous.while the intrigue was compelling enough to dive into the book at first, the unclear and blurry world building made it quite boring after a few chapters. I was under the impression that the author would simplify and distill explanations throughout the story. (how many powers there’s in the wild, for exemple.) but the main question that puzzled the entirety of the book was\'why the trials?\'. i believed it was ancestral, but it wasn\'t. we were not given a concret clarification of why they had to go through them. (solely for the sake of money? sure.)the writing was mediocre to say the least, with an abondance of”blue eyes""not very well dispatched in the narrative. repetitive expressions that clearly underline that the author needs to urgently change editors. the predictability in the dialogues was a major issue for me. It appeared thatKai and Pae were constantly attempting to make the most stereotypical comments. even the king\'s speeches were not as majestic as they should have been.the lack of depth in the characters was the primary reason for my difficulty in going through these 500 pages. why didn\'t the author incorporate any other colors into Pae\'s character other than her still mourning her deceased father? or to Kai to aspire to be more than the future enforcer ? all he does is complain and mop about his obligation to kill people and his brother\'s inability to handle it if the roles where inversed. instead of it being a well depicted enemies to lovers with good character’s wisdom and portrayal it just wavered into them already thinking about each other in a romantic way. all that because the narrative forced them to spend a lot of time with each other.how do you persuade readers to want to continue a trilogy when they aren\'t that attached to the protagonists in the first place?⚠️⚠️⚠️spoilersi did not sign for a love triangle.the way pae inlassably brought up her father’s death and how Kai made strange comments about his first murder seemed like he killed her father not the king.——-here we go..'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'you should know i’m honest to my core when i tell you that i love the author - i think she is an angel of a human being - but i really did not love her book. tragic considering i went in expecting to enjoy it. one day i will stop getting bamboozled by this exact variety of tiktok hype but that day is apparently not today!!!similar to the hunger games i guess if you are ok with nothing making in-universe sense and the reasoning behind it all being “🤷\u200d♀️ i dunno, vibes?” instead of a thoughtful critique of capitalism, commodification, and spectacle.i think i could have gotten past that though (not everything has to be that serious lmfao i am an ali hazelwood fan…i would be throwing stones from a GLASS HOUSE) but the writing was just so over the top and longwinded-but-also-average-fanfiction-vibes in a way that is difficult to capture in a review but that you’d get right away reading the book. it is this very specific style where the author says something, and then says it again but with other words that start with the same letters, and then the sentence has ~parallelism~ but also it is so obviously baked in that it loses any impact. like: ""she was Bold and Beautiful and Beyond my Bountiful expectations."" but x1000 all throughout the book. i found it pretty hard to get through by the end.with that said - i am but one (1) girl, this is a minority opinion. most people i trust online like this book. i think if the writing style doesn’t bother you this could be mindlessly fun a la fourth wing. it doesn\'t take itself particularly seriously. the central relationship is very slow burn and has ample yearning/a decent foundation - though it is quite instalove in terms of their individual feelings, NOT legitimate enemies to lovers (they like each other lmao) and the banter (much like the writing) is often over the top. the story has a mountain of cliches - but they are cliches for a reason. sometimes you just want something silly that is full of all of your guilty pleasure tropes. this was not my experience. but it could be yours, and i hope lauren keeps writing!!!'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3 starsit’s time to be honest.let me start by saying that i didn’t (and still don’t) know who lauren is on booktok. sothis review is unbiased as possible. 🫶🏻(please don’t forget that a 3 stars isn’t a bad rating either.)the first half of this book was nearly a copy and paste of the hunger games.while some readers probablywantthat, it took away from originality for me. i could NOT stop comparing for storyline.

For this being Lauren’s first book, I was impressed. It has a solid storyline and great characters. Overall, I didn’t hate it and can’t wait to see how the story will continue.I will say I wish the world building was more in depth and expanded, along with the characters.

I don’t read much fantasy because im a romance girly but this satisfied me so much. not to mention i was helplessly in love with kai the whole entire time, so that introduced a little bias heheh.🌏 the world building:it wasn’t confusing at all, for once I actually understood what was going on instead of them having the most twisted storyline with the craziest names that you can’t even pronounce. I definitely think this is a good book to get into fantasy, and if you actually wanna see romance and not just crumbs🫂 romanceeee 🫂yall I guarantee youthis will be the best banteryou ever, ever read. it’s too good. they bounce off eachother so well, they flirt SHAMELESSLY and we love to see it hehe.“Promise me you’ll stay alive long enough to stab me in the back?” I laugh loudly. “That’s been my goal all along, prince.”lets ignore the fact thatshe does stab him in the back.. and think about how cute these two are 🤭🤭 seriously one of my new fav couples, the most chemistry ive seen in agess. if this book wasn’t so damn stressful, I’d reread this book until I have it memorised, but I think I’ll just go back and read my fav scenes.🩶 kai azer 🩶i think i read like 10 chapters, and then immediately ran to put him in mybook husbands shelf.I was that confident he was gonna eat, and tbh, without him this is just a mediocre book.“Mark my words, prince, I will be your undoing.” I lean in, ignoring the knife against my throat as murmur, “Oh, darling, I look forward to it.”like come on,how do you not fall in love right after that?if it were me, i’d fold the minute he called me darling. but hey, pae is strong, and we love that.she literally beat all the elites without any powers?that’s just embarrassing for them. i would crumble after task 1. not even after, like five minutes in.🗡️ paedyn gray 🗡️she’s my fav kind of fmc.so strong, but also super funny? and has a backbone whichwe love.only thing I didn’t love ishow badly she treated kitt. believe it or not, I actually liked him. he was kind, he was sweet, he just wanted his father to love him which like who doesn’t you can’t blame him for that. I hope he gets a good ending, maybe not with paeBECAUSE KAIPAE FORVER!!but like in general I don’t want him to die or anything.

Thank you🥰)❗️•It was a Red queen fan fiction.•Zero original ideas.•The last 40 pages were the only interesting and unique plot from the author.•Long boring (bad structured) paragraphs•Wattpad diologue.•Lazy writing.•The Characters reactions made no sense.•Enemies to lovers? More like: forced and lazy interactions to enemies (ig)•Quotes that felt repetitive or were directly written many times in the same page or chapter.⚔️ “Inspired by Red queen and The hunger games” = excuse to not say she copied everything about those two series and changed some aspects or characters in the most lazy way. Example:The cream that cures Katniss and it’s sent from Haymitch is changed into: Kai finding a remedy to cure Paedyn because it might’ve fallen from another person’s pocket. LIKE WHAT?⚔️Everything about the trials was boring and didn’t make any sense. When it first started I was like: Finally! 200 pages of nothing, maybe it gets better and then boom IT NEVER DID.⚔️Paedyn and Kitt had more chemistry than Paedyn and Kai (it felt so forced). They were ALWAYS finding each other (also another way to never develop the other characters that had a lot of potential since they all had different and interesting powers). The “I hate you” but I have no idea why was SO HARD IN THIS BOOK.⚔️When I got to Kai’s POV, he was always saying that she wanted to be enemies but in reality they were always flirting and touching each other because they have to have “quemistry” but apparently you also have to force an enemies to lovers trope because what is revealed at the end has to make sense but it never does. It’s very clear that there is NO reason for you to hate Kai because of his “beauty” and the fact that he remains you of his father. Which also leads me to talk about the king and queen:⚔️THE QUEEN was never there, she loved Kai but never did anything for him. Why? We are given a poor excuse that that was correct for him and he was always destined to become the enforcer and suffer.⚔️THE KING and his personality that didn’t make sense, bother me SO MUCH and let’s not talk about his poor dialogues. He was the reason of all the tragedies and traumas but he was even sharing dinner in the same table with everyone!!!😁You can do that, yes! My problem is that he doesn’t have a well developed personality leading his character to become ridiculous in the eyes of the reader.⚔️And I say instead of forcing Kai and Paedyn to find each other ALL THE TIME use all those pages to make her interact with the other characters like Lenny: cuz wdym he calls you princess and likes you out of nowhere (remember if you’re writing a book you are telling the story to the readers not to you! So even if it looks “obvious” you have to develop that relationship and write it directly)⚔️Also, let’s not talk about the amount of ridiculous nicknames🙄🙄🙄⚔️Adena was there at the beginning and at the end, leaving me like: ok you love her so much but she’s barely mentioned throughout the book.⚔️The father taught her how to fight and he was a healer 💀The characters had NO personality, only plain mid and typical backstories.⚔️If you haven’t read Red Queen then you probably are not going to understand why I said this book is a Red Queen fan fiction:•Adena: Mare’s sister. They both design clothes.•Kai: Cal but with a flirting personality (oh but let’s not forget that we have to force him into a dark “I don’t share my feelings cuz I’m a monster” character.) Also, what’s with Paedyn describing him as a cocky bastard and two pages latter saying that he was this mysterious guy 🧍🏻\u200d♀️.•Kitt: Naive prince who’s clearly becoming the villain at the end: Maven.⚔️And I could go on and on but honestly it bores me to tears to remember all of the characters because that’s what the story was: plain and boring(unnecessarily long).⚔️Like I said: a Fan fiction (dare I say that Red queen was at least more unique) and it felt as if the author wrote this and never check it before publishing it. It was like: here🤲🏻 theres this book that feels incredibly overwhelming and it has a lot of tropes that are a favorite on booktok but I didn’t develop them well.⚔️I’ve said this before and I’m gonna say it again: There is one book on Wattpad that includes royals and everything and it was 100% better than this “book”. So if you read books in Spanish you should definitely give it a try!!! It’s called EL PERFUME DEL REY. (And yes I read this recently so there is no: I read this in 2015 you’ll probably not like it now) The book is also in a physical copy!!! And has illustrations😍⚔️People recommend this saying that is very cheesy and it’s for a younger audience, when in reality there are BETTER books with VERY YA scenes like: Once upon a broken heart that were actually good (I’m 18)⚔️Anyway. I say, read this if you want to but I still think it’s not fair that you have to pay 20$ for something that copied basically everything from other popular books and everyone on booktok is hyping it knowing damn well this has a poor plot and it should be on Wattpad.⚔️Im gonna say this a last time: I paid for this book and I feel like at least I deserve to give my opinion on it and WHY I didn’t like it.I gave it 1⭐️ because Ik there could be more improvement and it’s also very impressive that somebody wrote 500 pages at 18!'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""What in The-Hunger-Games-Divergent-Serpent-and-the-Wings-of-Night-Throne-of-Glass-Young-Elites-Shatter-Me fandom mash-up is this?Disclaimer:I know nothing of the author and don’t keep up with BookTok books, so this review is unbiased in every possible way. Even in moments where I may diss the book, I have absolutely nothing against the author and am open to reading her future releases.That being said, I have lost faith in humanity.I truly do not understand the hype for this. At all. There are so many other, better written fantasy romance novels out there.It wasn’t just that this was unoriginal and bad writing, but the romance was awful, the characters bland, the plot pacing so damn slow with so many pointless scenes, and every plot aspect was absolutely RIDDLED with logistic issues. If you take the time to look at things for half a second, the whole thing falls apart irrevocably.This whole thing hinges upon tropes and other peoples’ nostalgia and love for to all the books I just listed above.People are actually recommending this to fans of The Hunger Games.For the love of God, if you are a true fan of The Hunger Games, DO. NOT. pick this up.This is SO bad that to compare it to that is to make a mockery of the franchise.The concept of The Hunger Games has a sick sort of logic to it that makes sense.This, whatever trials were in Powerless, did not make sense.So the whole conflict in this world is that the king basically kills all the powerless, called Ordinaries, and the Fatals, which are the those who have powers so strong they are a threat to everyone, Ordinary or Elite. He does this to keep the Elites strong and him in power, believing that reproducing with Ordinaries will deplete the Elite’s power overtime.Okay. Fine. But then why would you host the Purging Trials where many of your treasured elites might die?? Not only that, but to contradict again, it’s literally said multiple times that the trials are meant to showcase powers, not to kill other contestants. But with a name like the PURGING trials, what else do you think the contestests are going to do? Come on. Also, most of the contestants are literally childhood friends or acquaintances, and you’re telling me they’re nonchalantly killing them off, when it’s not even required to win the trials? I’m sorry, but I’m not rooting for or sympathizing with ANY of these sadistic characters. This isn’t morally grey, this is pure evil.Building upon the issues I’ve already brought up and my many questions that remain unanswered, the novel is a mess of plot holes.I’m sure most of this is due to the fact that the plot was not born from an idea—whether it be world, character, or plot based. It’s built from a trope, which is never a solid foundation for a book.I am so tired of this new trend of trope-dumping. Sure, tropes are nice, even amazing, in extreme moderation. And even then, thetropes should not be the driving force in a novel or even in plot progression.These are like literary devices, used to elicit a certain atmosphere or feeling, whether in the story or readers. Tropes do not a plot make. They are not a substitute, they are not character building, they are not even effective romance development techniques. So please, for all of our sake, let's move on!There are many more plot holes, but at this point my frustration over it all, while writing this, is becoming unhealthy so I’ll just stop while I’m ahead.There is nothing of substance to the characters.Nothing to differentiate them from one another and nothing to make them anything but the basic stereotypes of whatever role they’re intended to fulfill.Prince Kai is the worst of them all. He’s supposed to be some badass, monstrous assassin for the king. But nothing ever backs up these claims. In fact, Roberts goes so overboard on his charming nature (which is more cringeworthy than actually charming) and his romantic feelings for the FMC that he’s honestly softer than every other character in the novel. Result the exact opposite of the intention, I’m sure.Paedyn has the most pick-me energy that I’ve had the displeasure of reading in recent memory. She screams Wattpad fanfic on the basis of she has no flaws, her only weakness being her supposed love for others and her unparalleled heroism.The dialogue between characters is the worst.I could not keep my face straight when I read it; the secondhand embarrassment was worse than the experience of watching DUFF or Awkward. (Y’all know what I’m talking about, I know you do).The romance is terrible. I tried to think of a better way to put it, but I could not without altering the truth of the matter.Why, why, why do we follow this ridiculous love triangle between Paedyn and the two royal brothers, Kai and Kitt? For one, this screams heavily influenced by Red Queen. For another, the novel is literally a fantasy romance told from the perspectives of Paedyn and Kai. We know it’ll be their romance in the end, because Kitt’s POV is not included. So why waste our time? It literally adds nothing to the story.Onto the actual romance at the forefront of the novel, this is as insta-love as it can possibly get, folks. Sometimes, insta-love is called for, most of the time it’s not. Have I ever liked it either way? Absolutely the fuck not, there’s the door.🚪Kai and Paedyn have no chemistry. How could they when they’re lusting over one another from the moment they lay eyes on each other? Their romance goes from 0-100 REAL QUICK, and I’m talking 30% of the way in. Then, as if the author remembers that, actually, we need to slip the “slow burn” trope in, she decides the characters need to blatantly fawn over one another for damn near the rest of the book but do nothing about it. Literally, what is the purpose? The slow burn doesn’t hit the same if you’ve already solidified the romance in the first 100 pages.Anyway, I did not like this. Pick up some Carissa Broadbent instead, okay folks?""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'This was not good. As a trending booktok book, I didn’t really know what I was getting into because those are always a bit of a toss up, but it was still one of my most anticipated releases.The main issue with Powerless is that it was written FOR social media. It was written around popular tropes even if putting in those tropes was completely out of place and forced. Now listen, I’m not against using popular tropes or anything, but they’re only effective if they come naturally and actually have a reason to be there. It felt completely unoriginal because I had read it all before.And it wasn’t just the tropes that made this book so unoriginal. I swear that this was just a carbon copy of The Hunger Games x Red Queen. The characters were all 2D versions of characters from the Hunger Game, the world building was literally the exact same as in Red Queen except if the Red Queen Universe hosted an annual Hunger Games, and the plot was just a bunch of copy and pasted moments from both. I understand that with fantasy books you’re always going to see some parallels between books, but this was insane. It was so so bad. Every page was deja vu and not in a good way. As someone who loved the Hunger Games (not Red Queen as much but I can respect it), some of this honestly felt a little disrespectful because it was so similar yet there was no meaningfulness or relevance to everything. THG is a commentary on our modern-day capitalist society and so many of the scenes and premises that were blatantly copied in this book actually held incredible importance in THG but were just thrown in with no meaning or thought whatsoever here.Then there was the romance, the reason we’re all here. I feel kind of 50/50 on this because Kai and Paedyn did have some “chef’s kiss” moments, but the tension was so overdone. When you put in so much sexual tension, there comes a point where it’s no longer tense. I also hated how Kai was always calling Pae “darling,” not because I hate that name or anything, but because it was used all the time and felt really forced. I also don’t understand all the nose flicking. Why was Kai always flicking Paedyn’s nose for no apparent reason. That will never not be weird. Nonetheless, it was one of the book’s better aspects which is great because it is, in fact, romantasy.The writing also wasn’t too bad, especially considering that this is a debut novel. However, the use of the term “ocean eyes” was literally criminal and I don’t think I’ll be able to listen to that song again (iykyk). Oh, and “cocky bastard” too. We can do better than that.The world building, like I said before, was completely unoriginal, but it also made about 0 sense. I mean, the whole idea behind the Purging Trials is so that the kingdom can showcase the power of the elites, but the whole thing was so flimsy. Like, you’re going to have a bunch of people with powers go fight each other (and kill each other, although it was never explained if that was the actual goal or what) and film them for… entertainment purposes? Don’t even get me started on the whole history with the Elites and Ordinaries with the Plague and everything. So many plot holes in this regard.I will say that this book was very entertaining and bingeable. Despite the fact that I kind of hated it, it still would be one of my go-to’s for a reading marathon or a long trip or something like that.In the end, this was a huge letdown for me. It really is an interesting example of how social media is effecting the book industry and, while I think there are some good things that come out of this, I really have a lot of issues with it. Honestly, Powerless was so formulaic that it almost felt like it was generated by AI (I know it wasn’t- I’ve been following Lauren Roberts on social media for a while and I’ve seen what she’s put into this book). I know the that a lot of people love this book but it wasn’t for me. 2 stars.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '“But I’m never sober around you, Pae.

Sometimes it can be at the very end of the book where the two characters kiss and it\'s just hard to wait that longi’m kind of impatient when it comes to romance 🙉BUT…. this book kind of changed my perspective a little bit. To say I really liked this is an understatement. It’s such a beautiful, playful and humorous book. The plot the characters especially the characters specifically the female character, PAE!!! She is such a inspiration to all people especially girls!! I just love the way she carried herself and just went through the competition with such grace, passion, and determination. This book also reminded me a lot of my favorite dark romance series Blood and Ash series. The threats of how stabbing turns people on is just giving Casteel from blood and ash and it was like living deja vu all over again. But yeah this book had a little something of everything and I loved it sm!! I will say as someone who isn\'t really a slowburn fan I’m thinking about reconsidering after reading this. 💗 Infinity x Infinity stars all around!!!⚔Main Characters⚔☘Pae☘This girl is my heart and soul!! I love her sm!! She is such a powerful female character. I love how she doesn’t try to just fit in with the other girls. Every chance she got she spoke up and expressed her feelings. And even when she wasn’t trying to she was so funny. Her relationship with Kai is just so cute and so romantic. Ik they didn’t really get a good kiss but Ik they’re is definitely something special for them in the cards. I really hope that she is still able to continue to being herself no matter what even after what happened. Usually its rare to get this much female agency throughout a whole book let alone a series so I’m hoping that she is able to just be true to herself and keep fighting for her relationship with Kai no matter what. Also can we just talk about the dresses she wore with the high slit and the dagger on her thigh and didn\'t even bat an eye at the traditional dresses that everyone had to wear that was all the same color. I’m talking badass girl right there!! 🎀💘💖☘Kai☘Kai is literally the book guy everyone wants. 😍He is so funny and smart. He cares sm eventho he doesn’t seem like he does at first. He literally spared people when he was supposed to kill them And ofc he is absolutely so handsome. Like I was giggling and kicking my feet he was just so cute and so entertaining to read about. And the way he always put caring for Pae over his other duties was just so thoughtful and he is literally on of the best mmc in like book history. And I loved when he was so attentive to Pae and always found some way to crack a joke while flirting was just so swoonworthy. 😋 Like idk how I’m going to survive while Reckless isn’t here yet. And there was one scene I loved sm when they were talking about feelings and she was trying to put her walls up and he like next time don’t tap your left foot and lie to me. Like somehow he just knew.⚔Side Characters⚔The were all pretty decent the best friend was my favorite. She was so sweet and I wish things could have been better (if you know you know) I’m not even going to talk about the father I didn’t like him at all. But the brother ofc I ended up liking him too especially when he was flirting with Pae �� but midway I kinda just stopped idk why I just think he wasn’t that interesting like I thought.⚔Best Couple Moments⚔🌸Their 1st\xa0 meet up🌱Gifted her a knife🌸Kai putting food on Pae’s plate for her bc she was refusing to eat and she seemed shy🌱Their little fights🌸Their dance lessons🌱Everytime he called her darling🌸Her favorite color is blue bc she loves his eye color🌱He helped her through her panic attack🌸He wrote on his arm ‘she said I could touch her when I’m sober’🌱Pae comforting Kai during his nightmare🌸Their picnic in the garden⚔Favorite Scenes⚔▪︎“Do you always fall into the arms of handsome strangers, or is it a new thing for you?” (Kai)“No, only the cocky ones.” (Pae)“Well looks like I’ve made quite the first impression then. Your clumsiness found me, so I hardly call it a curse.” (Kai)▪︎”Kai, I’m not leaving.” (Pae)“Then don’t think I won’t throw you over my damn shoulder and carry you out of here myself. Is that what you want?” (Kai)▪︎”Maybe because you have to be a gentleman to be gentlemanly.” (Pae)“And who says I’m not?” (Kai)“I’d like to find someone who says you are.” (Pae)▪︎”Well maybe if you’d kept your eyes on the dance floor and your nose out of your glass, we wouldn’t be in this situation.” (Pae)“Oh, darling, my eyes were on the dance floor. They were on you dancing with my brother. Why do you think I’ve been drinking?” (Kai)▪︎”Do share her with the other gentlemen, wont you?” (Kai’s mom)“She’s mine for the night, Mother.” (Kai)▪︎”I could get used to you being a gentleman, Azer.” (Pae)“And I could get used to being one for you, Gray.” (Kai)▪︎”I’m a fool.” (Kai)“Only when you\'re around me?” (Pae)“Only for you.” (Kai)⚔Favorite Quotes⚔▪︎”Oh, don’t worry, Father, I won’t make the mistake of showing up to the throne room without a shirt. Again.” (Kai)▪︎”Every girl deserves something equally as pretty and deadly as they are.” (Kai)▪︎”I make it my business to know all the pretty girls who save my little brother.” (Kitt)▪︎”If it weren’t for my current situation, this could be a lot more fun.” (girl was sitting on his ribs covered in blood) (Kai)▪︎”For starters, I don’t appreciate my opponents going easy on me.” (Pae)▪︎”Oh, darling, as long as you still think I’m pretty, I don’t give a damn what I look like.” (Kai)▪︎”I don’t want your mercy. Next time we fight, impress me.” (Pae)▪︎”By all means, carry on. I’ll never deny myself the chance of watching you watch me.” (Kai)▪︎”Remind me to make you smile like that again, when you aren’t dying, and I have all the time in the world to memorize it.” (Kai)▪︎”I’m going to ask again. Who did this to you?” (Kai)▪︎“Oh, I’m not making you do anything, darling. You can leave me to bleed out if you must. Because I only want your hands all over me if you want them to be.” (Kai)▪︎”You know. I’m beginning to think that you enjoy getting hurt, if only so you can have my hands all over you.” (Kai)▪︎”Who needs a pillow when I have you?” (Kai)▪︎”You know you didn’t have to spill my drink all over me to get me alone.” (Kai)▪︎”It’s not the winning that I find fun. It’s you, darling.” (Kai)▪︎“But I’m never sober around you, Pae. Never not drunk on every detail that is you.” (Kai)⚔The Ending⚔The ending was so messy and heartbreaking and I was crying sm!! 😭 Like idk what to even say. I think it was kinda something we all knew partly bc of events that led up to it. However what happened with Kai was shocking bc usually stuff like that has gone differently but ih this was a new twist to the book which was so heartbreaking. And like the history with their fathers was crazy. I wish I could say more but I don\'t want to spoil it for those who haven\'t read it.⚔Hopes for Reckless⚔🌱More Kai and Pae romance🌸The ending resolved🌱More humor⚔Last Thoughts⚔I really liked this book a lot and I\'m hoping the next one delivers and it doesn\'t end up like the way Ruthless Vows was.

The plot remains consistent, a blend of mostly-ordinary family affairs and uncanny abnormalities--notably the increasingly restless brood of apparitions and river monsters. Though there was a revealing prophecy early on (Book #1 I believe), the ending still left me surprised and satisfied. I didn't realize how much I loved Blackwater until it was over and I had to return to the real world, with no more pages of Caskey history to follow.After some reflection I'll post a review of what I thought of the complete 1000+ page saga as a single entity, which is what it really is.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Sexta y última entrega de esta novela que McDowell sacó por entregas en 1983 y que la editorial Blackie Books rescató en febrero de este año en estas ediciones tan bonitas y cómodas, con unas portadas preciosas y minuciosas que al fijarte bien en ellas te das cuenta de la cantidad de detalles relevantes que contienen y que tienen mucho que ver con lo que tras sus páginas ocurre.Este volumen no solo concluye la historia de los Caskey sino que también ofrece una amplia visión sobre la naturaleza humana y el poder de la familia.Tengo que reconocer que me ha costado mucho asumir y darme cuenta que con este número se acabó todo; adiós a los Caskey, adiós a Perdido 🥹, me ha inundado (y nunca mejor dicho 🤣🤣) una sensación de tremenda tristeza tras cerrar la última pagina de este volumen, y eso que hubo algún número que se centró demasiado en hablar de los negocios de este poderoso clan; quizás La fortuna y La guerra son probablemente los que más se van por las ramas. Pero al fin y al cabo, no deja de ser una saga familiar con todo lo que ello implica; celos, traiciones de todo tipo, venganzas, amoríos varios y muertes a mansalva. Todo ello aderezado con las dosis justas de misterio y una pizca de terror que aunque poco, me han sabido a gloria. McDowell era un experto creando ambientes y atmósferas en las que muy poco a poco te va metiendo en situación, narrando el día a día de las gentes de Perdido hasta que de pronto te suelta una escena narrada al detalle con la que te deja la sangre helada y el corazón a punto de sufrir un paro cardíaco.Así es la escritura de este buen señor 🖤 Haciendo uso de una narrativa visualmente muy rica y donde lo real junto con lo fantasioso coexisten de manera relativamente armoniosa.Desde este mismo momento no pienso dejar de leer todo lo que tenga traducido. Blackie Books; ejem, ejem, ve poniéndote las pilas y traduciendo lo que falta 😂😂 En casa tengo pendiente solamente ""Los elementales"", por si quiero volver a ese rincón del sudeste de los EE.UU, Alabama😍 y ""Voces del silencio"". Esta última McDowell no pudo acabarla tras su muerte prematura en 1999 y fue su amiga Tabitha King (la mujer del gran Stephen King) la que le dio fin.Para quienes aún no se hayan aventurado a leerlos, les recuerdo el orden ⤵️1️⃣ La riada.2️⃣ El dique.3️⃣ La casa.4️⃣ La guerra.5️⃣ La fortuna.6️⃣ Lluvia.Han pasado más de cuatro décadas desde la gran inundación de 1919 con la que se abrió paso el primer volumen. Imagínense todo lo que puede ocurrir en este lapso de tiempo. Es por ello que no me voy a detener a hablar del cierre, no quiero caer en spoilers, por eso prefiero hacer una valoración global, que es francamente positiva, de la saga al completo. Sin extenderme demasiado, o al menos intentarlo 😅Este número da comienzo en 1958, y como su propio título indica, el agua aquí también será la gran protagonista.Y es que, como es lógico, el paso del tiempo acaba pasando factura y la muerte arrasa con todo al mismo tiempo que la gran protagonista aquí, que no es otra que la lluvia.Les pongo un extracto para que vean una pequeña muestra de su estilo, en especial cuando está relatando los cotilleos del clan. Este en concreto me parece que expresa la realidad de muchas familias 😂⤵️""[...] Pues sí, la quería mucho, mucho. Nunca he querido a nadie tanto como a ella. Pero gracias a Dios está muerta, y gracias a Dios nunca volverá. En su día ella dirigía el cotarro, pero ahora la que manda soy yo. Así que es mejor que no tengamos que pelearnos.""Cómo la vida misma 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣Como digo, pasamos de estos momentos de distensión familiar a relatar escenas de terror que me hicieron estremecer.Como pega que le encuentro es que a la parte más fantasiosa no se le llega a dar una explicación satisfactoria así como algún hecho en concreto que no me encajó del todo, pero llegado al final me he dado cuenta que ni lo he echado en falta. Así lo quería McDowell y con eso me quedo.Creo que tampoco era algo necesario para disfrutar y comprender la historia y le hubiera restado gran parte de la magia 💚🔝🌧️👌🏻Al final, tal y como la lluvia fue protagonista al abrir esta serie con la inundación de 1919, vuelve a hacer acto de presencia al cerrar la historia. ¿Previsible? Puede, aunque obviamente muchos aspectos me pillaron completamente desprevenida. Y eso no le ha quitado ni una pizca del disfrute que he sentido.Me ha parecido el cierre perfecto para una historia que me ha hecho pasar grandes momentos desde que la empecé en febrero.Con mucha pena me despido de los Caskey.Te echaré de menos Perdido 🥹https://m.facebook.com/profile.php/?i...📖🖤'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Nota global de la novela (las seis entregas) 4⭐Llegamos al tan deseado como temido final. Han sido tres meses con esta novela y más allá de la polémica de si las entregas han encarecido o no el producto final, lo cierto es que he disfrutado de los libros, de la espera quincenal y de lo bonitos que son. No sé si me apuntaría a otra (el bolsillo también hay que tenerlo en cuenta), pero voy a echar de mucho menos los miércoles de Blackwater. Dicho esto, vamos al lío.En esta sexta y última entrega, McDowell sigue el esquema de las anteriores. Cronológicamente va desde finales de los cincuenta hasta la década de los setenta. La generación de los Caskey que conocimos en 1919 envejece. La vida continua y, aunque la protagonista indiscutible sigue siento Elinor, el autor pone el acento en Miriam y en la nueva generación, Lilah, la hija de Frances y Tommy Lee, el hijo de Lucille.A estas alturas qué puedo decir de los personajes que ya no se sepa. Mujeres fuertes que manejan la familia y hombres que reconocen sus méritos. No son figuras en blanco y negro, todos son grises, diría incluso que gris marengo. Por uno u otro motivo, no hay ni un solo Caskey, de sangre o por matrimonio, que se salve de ese tono.Como siempre las escenas de terror nos pillan por sorpresa. Es el sello de McDowell, centrarse en lo cotidiano, conseguir que el lector se olvide que está leyendo una novela de terror y, cuando menos te lo esperas, el bofetón que sobrecoge. Hay varias en este último libro, todas de nota y todas trabajadas y gestadas desde entregas anteriores (qué bueno es McDowell). Una de ellas, tengo que decir que me dejó hecha unos zorros.¿Y el deseado final? A mí me ha gustado. Se le pueden poner peros, yo misma se los pongo, y aun con ellos McDowell resuelve bien. No es del todo inesperado, ya se nos anticipa en uno de los libros y, al menos una parte, se veía venir. ¿Los peros? Me deja con un montón de preguntas no resueltas del todo, al menos no resueltas desde mi perspectiva de lectora que necesita más detalles. Tampoco es exactamente que no de respuestas a los interrogantes que va diseminando a lo largo de la novela, sino que a mí me hubiera gustado que profundizase y saber más.En conclusión. Una novela por entregas a caballo entre el terror y el gótico sureño. Buen ritmo, buena trama y personajes atractivos. Recomendable.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'empecé a leer estos libros sin tener muy claro de qué iban y me encontré con una de las cosas que más disfruto en el mundo: la historia de una familia (que no os eche atrás la clasificación de thriller/terror. esos tintes están ahí, pero en definitiva es una historia de dramas y conspiraciones familiares)los caskey me han acogido como a uno más en una de sus numerosas casas y me han hecho disfrutar de unos personajes estupendos, testaduros, maquiavélicos y dulces. me lo he pasado como un niño chico viendo cómo crecían, se peleaban, se traicionaban y se reconciliaban.perdido y su río se van a quedar en mi cabeza mucho tiempo, y casi que al final del libro podía oler su agua enturbiada. 🫂'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""This has to be one of the most satisfying series I've ever read.A stunning multi-generational epic full of drama, mystery, familial obligations and secrets.

El libro es un resumen de algo más grande. Ese no contarlo todo, ese dar grandes saltos temporales, genera una sensación de angustia, como cuando estás escuchando un cotilleo y quieres que la historia termine ya pero a la vez no.En fin, ¡deseando comentarlo con amigas!'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'J’ai plutôt bien apprécié ce tome même si certains des personnages m’ont beaucoup agacé. Je pense notamment à Sister qui, petit à petit, devient comme sa mère, ou Lilah qui prend modèle sur sa tante telle qu’elle était dans le quatrième tome. J’imagine que c’est une façon de montrer que la boucle est bouclée ou que le passé finit toujours par se répéter (et c’est clairement la thématique de ce tome) mais ça donne forcément une impression de redite que je trouve un peu dommage.⠀En revanche, j’aime toujours autant le personnage d’Elinor et j’ai aussi beaucoup aimé l’évolution de Miriam. Très clairement, les personnages féminins sont bien plus intéressants que les personnages masculins dans cette série. ⠀Comme dans tout le reste de la saga, les rapports humains ne sont pas toujours des plus réalistes avec des relations de couples assez étranges et toujours un traitement bizarre des enfants, mais on commence à être habitués à tout ça je suppose.⠀J’ai trouvé que l’aspect fantastico-horrifique arrivait un peu plus tôt dans ce tome, notamment avec une scène dans la maison de Queenie que j’ai trouvé assez angoissante. En revanche, je suis un poil déçu que les différents mystères ne soient pas vraiment expliqués. La conclusion est tout à fait satisfaisante mais c’est vrai que quelques réponses n’auraient pas été de trop.⠀Pour conclure avec un avis global sur la série, je ne regrette pas de m’être laissé tenté par cette saga. Je ne pense pas qu’il s’agisse d’un incontournable de la littérature que tout le monde devrait absolument découvrir, mais il s’agit d’un très bon divertissement et c’est tout ce que je demandais pour ma part.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Pioggiaha confermato quello che mi è sembrato sempre più ovvio, nel corso della saga, e cioè che c'è mistero, cupezza, e orrore, ma non l'azione. E' un storia che non alza la voce, non urla, ma sussurra piccoli e grandi segreti. L'autore ha voluto mischiare quotidianità, periferia americana, persino eventi storici, a qualcosa di fantastico, legato al mondo dell'orrore. L'idea è piacevole, avvincente, e i libri sono di compagnia. Mi sono anche resa conto che non c'è molta profondità, nello sviluppo dei personaggi, ma è come se il lettore fosse spinto a rimanere sempre un po' a distanza. Sarebbe stato un lavoro di più ampio respiro, forse molto più godibile, se fossero state prese altre decisioni sullo stile. Senza questionare sulle scelte della trama. Arrivata alla fine della saga mi sento di dire che gli ultimi volumi, soprattutto il quarto e il quinto, sono pieni di eventi un po' noiosi. L'arricchirsi della famiglia, ad esempio, cioè il racconto sulla ricchezza, l'ho trovato un po' ridondante. Non voglio dire che ho disprezzato queste parti che critico, perché tirando le somme tutto è stato piacevole.Parte spoiler:Il finale distruttivo l'ho apprezzato. Nella parte conclusiva sono tornati gli elementi dell'orrore, che mi hanno comunicato un po' di inquietudine. Era proprio questa, la sensazione che è mancata nei libri precedenti, quando gli elementi cupi abdicavano in favore dei racconti sulla ricchezza della famiglia Caskey. Il mio personaggio preferito è stato senz'altro Elinor. Un personaggio coerente, ben descritto, che segue una sua maturazione. E' di sicuro il punto forte dell'intera saga, l'anello che lega tutto quanto. Gli altri personaggi, soprattutto quelli maschili, non mi sono piaciuti granché. Miriam e Layla vincono il premio come personaggi più antipatici dell'intera saga, e avrei gradito che venissero spazzate via dalla pioggia finale. Ho apprezzato le morti degli altri personaggi, come quella di Queeny, e di Oscar. Mi hanno suscitato qualche brivido. Come il ritorno dal mondo dei morti di Mary Love.Un'altra cosa che è punto cardine della storia, insieme al personaggio di Elinor, è il legame del mondo visibile con quello invisibile e subacqueo dal quale lei proviene. Nel farlo percepire, nel raccontarlo senza raccontarlo chiaramente, l'autore è stato bravo. L'idea della trasformazione di queste creature, che dal fiume giungono a diventare donne, è inquietante e stranamente credibile nell'ambito della storia. Una sorta di retelling della sirenetta, addirittura, in chiave dark, e una storia che ha elementi femministi apprezzabili.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '“Senza altri annunci e avvertimenti, l\'acqua si dedicò all\'opera di cancellare Perdido dalla faccia della Terra”.Con unapienaè iniziata, e con unapienaè finita.La saga diBlackwaterci saluta con un ultimo, memorabile volume,""Pioggia"", che ci fa dono di una certa,ineluttabile malinconiae del tempo necessario a congedarci daiCaskeye dalla piccola città di Perdido.Sono ormai passati50 annida quando la barchetta diOscar Caskeyha tratto in salvoElinor, dando inizio alle vicende familiari deiCaskeye segnando per sempreil destino della cittàe dei suoi abitanti.Tra guerre, fortune, figli ceduti (le risate che mi sono fatta) e misteriose creature del fiume, questa sagalascia qualcosa dentroal lettore: non la dinamicità, puttosto rara tra le pagine dei volumi, bensì laquotidianità familiaree la straordinaria capacità diMichael McDowelldi delineare decine di personaggi diversi, tutti conpersonalità unichee impossibili da dimenticare.Il mio voto va alla saga per intero, capace di guidare il lettore in unadimensione completamente diversa.Capace di trasportarlo verso quella confluenza tra i due fiumi in cui sorge la piccola cittadina di Perdido,misteriosa e unicaproprio come i suoi meravigliosi abitanti.5 stelle🌟'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Que pena me da despedirme de esta saga, si es que me he hecho durar todo lo que he podido este último libro.Blackwater ha sido todo un descubrimiento que me ha tenido retenido en Perdido.Súper recomendable para todos los públicos, en especial a los que quieran algo fácil de leer.

Moins palpitant, un peu plus sur la retenue, et parfois meme un frustrant dans le peu de réponses qu’il apporte autour du mystère entourant Elinor.J’ai cependant beaucoup aimé la fin, et en particulier le dernier chapitre, qui clôt magistralement la saga et fait un très bel écho à la première scène du premier tome.La boucle est maintenant bouclée.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5⭐️(10/10)He terminado “La lluvia” tal que así 🥺😫😭Le he dedicado 10 días a la saga Blackwater y le doy las 5 estrellacas que se merece.El vacío que me ha dejado Elinor y toda la familia Caskey es tremendo 🥹🟡Contenido sensible animal'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Y llegó el final, un final creo que a la altura de este viaje por Perdido y sus gentes, la familia Caskey y lo que habita en la confluencia del río Perdido y el Blackwater.

Un lujo.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Y para mi gran sorpresa, cuando ha llegado la hora de despedirme de los Caskey y del pueblo de Perdido, lo he hecho con bastante pena. El verano de 2024 a nivel lector ha sido bastante raro para mí. En estos meses, como tengo más tiempo libre, siempre intento leer libros más densos y complicados por la forma en la que están escritos y por lo que cuentan, de esos que me costaría más seguir el resto del año debido a las obligaciones y a la rutina (con deciros, que para este verano planeaba leerme de una santa vez “ El Quijote…). Pero este año, el cuerpo me ha pedido todo lo contrario, literatura, ligerita y amena, y sobre todo mucha fantasía y es por eso que la saga “Blackwater” ha sido una acompañante perfecto durante estos días de tanto calor o más por lo fácil que es leer estos libros y lo mucho que enganchan. Si os soy sincera, no apostaba mucho porque esta serie me gustará tanto tanto como lo ha hecho. Lo he dicho en todos las reseñas anteriores, no me parece tan perfecta como muchos lectores la han puesto en sus reseñas. Pero reconozco que tiene cosas bastante buenas y adictivas. Y al final, después de sexto me he encariñado con algún que otro personaje…Cada vez ha sido más difícil ponerla sinopsis de estos libros según iba avanzando la historia. Así que para “La Lluvia” intentar ser lo más somera posible. La familia Caskey sigue enriqueciéndose en una racha de bonanza económica que parece que no va a acabar con los años. El pueblo de Perdido seguirá siendo testigo de cómo la estructura de la familia va cambiando, según vayan muriendo, algunos de sus miembros y otros crezcan hasta cobrar mayor importancia . Pero viejas deudas a saldar y venganzas por cobrar se han cocido a fuego lento en las propias paredes de las casas del clan. Mientras la naturaleza sigue su implacable curso bajo una feroz lluvia…Sin duda alguna, si alguien me pregunta, le diré que para mí los dos mejores volúmenes de esta serie son con diferencia sus dos últimos “La Fortuna” y este que estamos reseñando ahora, “La Lluvia”. El elemento sobrenatural se convierte, prácticamente, en estos libros en el LateMotiv principal de la historia, junto al auge de la familia Caskey y no queda tan relegado como desengrasante de la trama, o para darle un poco más de tensión y misterio al asunto. En ambos tomos siento que lo cotidiano y lo sobrenatural, lo rural y lo terrorífico están mucho mejor equilibrados que en los anteriores volúmenes, de forma que la historia gana una intensidad que, no negaremos, siempre ha tenido, pero que en esta ocasión tiene algo de demoníaco. En “La Lluvia” se lucen como nunca las grandes indudables habilidades de Michael McDowell como narrador. Ahora que ya conocemos como si fueran nuestra familia a los Caskell, el ritmo narrativo se siente que es el mejor salud que nunca, siendo ameno y trepidantemente fluido. Si los anteriores libros, los elementos y escenas sobrenaturales aparecían de vez en cuando, como revulsivo a la trama, ahora realmente resultan efectivos y ganan en importancia. McDowell se apoya en ellos para regalarnos varios giros de guion que te dejan impactados y descolocados, y que se sienten como un golpe en la cabeza que te dejan anonadado y sin saber muy bien por dónde van a ir los tiros. Y la atmósfera, que en todos los libros siempre ha tenido algo de amenazante agazapado tras la aparente calma, en estos últimos compases alcanza unas dosis de tensión, pavor e, incluso, en algunos momentos, claustrofobia, como nunca antes habían conseguido, dando lugar a escenas y situaciones absolutamente terroríficas, de esas que te hacen sentir un somero escalofrío, recorriendo de la espalda. Y eso es algo muy difícil de conseguir. Por lo menos tan bien como McDowell lo hace en sus novelas. Pero en estos dos últimos libros, y especialmente “Lluvia” este terror rural se permite implosionar con toda su grandeza, atrapando, irremediablemente al lector.El costumbrismo rural de la Alabama de principios.-mediados del siglo XX ha sido siempre uno de los elementos que más sabor identidad ha dado a esta saga, y sigue siendo el gran protagonista de muchos de los momentos de este último acto en el cual nos despedimos de los Caskey. “La Lluvia” está plagado de despedidas de algunos de estos conocidos, con los cuales nos hemos encariñado a lo largo de estos libros, mientras los miembros más jóvenes de la última generación ganan espacio en estas páginas finales. McDowell demuestra gran tino, desarrollando muchas de las relaciones que hay entre sus miembros, lo que ayuda a dar más profundidad a la historia, a la vez que también se permite echar, en ciertos momentos, un vistazo algunos de los miembros que más desdibujados han quedado a lo largo de esta historia ( y sí, me refiero al personaje de Oscar, que tan importante ha sido para la familia, pero tampoco peso ha tenido en la trama. Por cierto, me reafirmo en que Miriam es mi favorita. Me encanta eso de que diga claramente que lo que le gusta es ganar dinero dinero y mandar, creo que es de reina absoluta).Pero sin olvidarnos de ella, la gran protagonista de la historia, la mano que ha movido todos los hilos de esta red de telarañas, cuyos misterios han dado tanta sustancia a la trama. Con la llegada de Elinor empezó el escándalo y los engranajes comenzaron a moverse, mientras que el misterio que albergaban los ríos Blackwater y Perdido iban marcando los destinos de Perdido y los Caskell más de lo que ellos podrían percatarse. Así que es justo que hasta sus últimos impulsos, el desenlace de “Blackwater” la tenga a ella en su punto de mira, que todo gire entorno a su persona. Elinor me ha parecido en muchas ocasiones, y aún tenía esa impresión mientras leía este libro, de que es un personaje tan envuelto en el misterio que no acaba de despegar. Incluso, aunque en este libro se haga más descubrimientos sobre algunos de sus secretos, algo que me hubiera gustado que se hubiera hecho con más profundidad y lo que le hubiera dedicado mayor tiempo, pero aún así hay que reconocerle que ella ha sido no solo el pilar de esta historia, también lo es indiscutiblemente de los Caskey. Y del propio Perdido… y como se verá, todo lo que ella ha hecho por su familia durante más de 40 años les ha llevado a la gloria. Pero también es una espada de Damocles, que de alguna forma amenaza con caer sobre ella. Las últimas páginas del libro desarrollan una escena que resulta brutal, aterradora, de esas que dejan sin respiración y pegadas a las páginas del libro, y que se siente como el cierre perfecto de un círculo macabro creado a lo largo de años y formado por mujeres de carácter autoritario, rivalidades, decisiones implacables y venganzas sobrenaturales. Y es que cuando parecía que una de las tramas más importantes de la historia ya estaba cerrada, de pronto resurge con fuerza del más allá para convertirse en el último canto que resuena por las calles plagadas de agua y lluvia de un pueblo de Alabama.De todas maneras, sigo insistiendo que para mí el principal problema que ha tenido toda la saga “Blackwater” es, que aunque tiene un argumento realmente interesante y complejo, que en su mayor parte está muy bien hilvanado, siento que en ciertas partes le falta profundidad, debido a que Michael McDowell mete a veces el acelerador y pasa de puntillas por ciertos aspectos de la historia. Y eso evita que se sonde más en ciertas cuestiones y hace que la trama no termine, en ciertos aspectos, de estar totalmente bien conectada o de conseguir la profundidad que hubiera alcanzado si el ritmo hubiera sido más tranquilo. Creo que en esto tiene mucho que ver que el elemento sobrenatural no está explotado del todo en los meros volúmenes de esta novela río, y eso hace que, en ciertos momentos, todo el conjunto no termine de despegar y que se sienta que la trama no está del todo perfectamente hilvanada. además, en esta última entrega, sinceramente y esto es algo muy personal, no he sentido el mayor interés por las andanzas de la quinta y última generación de los Caskey, ya que me ha parecido muy repetitiva todo lo que habíamos leído en volúmenes anteriores, con una trama que no termina de cerrarse bien del todo cuando se acaba el libro y, en su mayor parte (con excepción de una escena casi al final del libro que resulta crucial para el final), parece que esos personajes están ahí de relleno para alargar el asunto, y para justificar lo que acabo de deciros, una de las últimas y fundamentales escenas de la novela. quizás solo por eso se justifique la importancia que el autor da a esta generación en el último libro, pero yo no puedo quitarme de la cabeza que para llegar a eso se podría haber valido de algún de los otros personajes que ya tenía mejor asentados, y que incluso, hubiera ayudado a dar a más de uno final, incluso más redondo.En definitiva, ni que decir tiene que la saga “ Blackwater” me ha dejado muy buen sabor de boca. Terror del bueno dado en pequeñas dosis y de una forma bien medida, que se entreteje con la intrahistoria de la familia Caskey y sus luchas y relaciones internas. Todo hecho desde la sencillez y la eficacia. Y es que para mí “Blackwater” no es tanto una historia de fantasía, como como una crónica familiar salpimentada con sabias dosis de terror y misterios del bueno. Y escrita de una manera tan amena y con una atmósfera tan potente, que es imposible no sumergirte en esta historia.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Pues finalizo esta obra dividida en distintos libros con una sensación contradictoria, por un lado satisfecho de esos tremendos personajes femeninos sobre todo y una impecable ambientación, pero con un deficit de fenómenos paranormales o de terror, del que apenas han salido pinceladas en este último tomo.Con este tomo se cierra de una manera el circulo que se inició en el 1º.

Gli amanti delle saghe familiari non potranno che apprezzare questa serie e volerne sempre di più.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Ok, este sí que fue un viaje. Ya lo dije en otra reseña de la saga, peroen mi mente es como un gran libro en vez de una saga, pues es una historia que sigue y sigue y sigue a lo largo de los años. Confieso que al leer el primero lo pasé bien, pero nada asombroso para destacar, sin embargo, a esta altura puedo decir querealmente me encariñé con los personajes. Siento que en este libro pasaron demasiadas cosas, me está costando organizar todo en mi cabeza.Han pasado dos años desde que Frances decidió entregarse a su lado no-humano, mientras los Caskey sigue ganando y ganando dinero. Lilah, la hija de Frances y Billy, es como una Miriam pequeña y todos están a la espera de cuáles serán sus acciones. Al mismo tiempo, unos fantasmas del pasado buscan vengarse de Elinor y lo que les hizo.Me sorprendió mucho la evolución en el personaje de Miriam, creo que es mi favorito, a pesar de sus momentos más crueles en este libro. Me dio mucha risa Miriam al inicio de este libro cuando de golpe anunció su compromiso y los motivos detrás de este. Tengo que confesar que, curiosamente, sí que hacían una buena pareja y ambos estaban satisfechos. Como dije, Miriam tomó una decisión cruel en este libro que pretendía herir a Elinor por abandonarla de niña, por lo quemucho de este libro se centró en la relación de ambas y en Miriam decidiendo perdonar a Elinor y tratarla como madre.Antes me quejé de que me faltó de la relación de Elinor y Oscar, pero en este libro ambos tuvieron una conversación que me conmovió. La forma en que Oscar siempre intuyó que había algo que ella le ocultaba, pero la amaba, y decidía no investigar más y vivir con ella como si nada.Si hubo alguna parte en Blackwater que pudo sacarme lágrimas, fue en la conversación que ambos tuvieron en un capítulo que, literalmente, se llamaba ""Oscar y Elinor"". Por esofue tan terrible el siguiente capítulo y lo que le sucedió a Oscar, fue una de las escenas más aterradoras y crueles de estos libros.""-Oscar, nunca he querido nada en este mundo aparte de ti -respondió Elinor con evasivas"".Sister ya era oficialmente una Mary-Love, solo que sin el poder que esta ejercía sobre la familia por medio de la manipulación y el dinero.Así que es un personaje solo molesto que Queenie es la única que soporta porque no tiene a nadie más con ella. Me molestó lo terca que fue para el final, en especial con Miriam que vivía con ella, pero al menos Miriam tenía una personalidad para sobreponerse a su rechazo y terquedad.Me gustó la vida que se armaron Lucille y Grace con Tommy Lee, el cómo lo cuidaban y lo tierno que él era.Creo que el libro hizo mucho esto, ponernos a hombres Caskey tiernos y suaves (aunque no fueran Caskey de sangre), como sumisos, mientras que toda la personalidad fuera se la llevan las mujeres de la familia.Me gustó que la autora no repitiera lo de Malcolm con este personaje para el final, hubiese sido tierno, pero perdería la emoción. Aunque sí que fue interesante el tono de promesa entre ambos y el cómo terminaron desarrollaron algo como una amistad.Otra cosa interesante fue el cómo Billy fue enterándose del secreto de Frances y Nerita, y su actitud al respecto.Billy era muy similar a Oscar en este sentido, tenía esa pasividad y entendimiento de que era mejor no saber ciertas cosas y dejar el poder en otros. Por eso,me gustó la dinámica que se dio entre Elinor y Billy, me hizo sentido, por la personalidad que este tenía y todo su pasado familiar.Me pareció muy tierno que él estuviera en el final del libro, él que era parte de la familia por elección y no sangre, al igual que Elinor.""No importa lo que hayas tenido que pasar, no importa lo que hayas hecho o sufrido, ni tampoco los errores que hayas cometido, por terribles que fueran; no importa que te rindierascuando debías perseverar o que perseveraras cuando deberías haberte rendido, ni tampoco que sucedieran cosas que te hicieran infeliz: no puedes desear que tu vida sucediera de otra forma"".Creo que el final de la saga fue perfecto para la historia, fue un círculo perfecto y no se me ocurre ninguna otra forma en que pudo terminar que fuera mejor que esta.De todos los libros, este es el que tuvo más muerte, pero tuvo que ver con que muchos personajes ya eran mayores, entonces sus muertes significaban que ahora el poder pasaba a las nuevas generaciones de la familia.El final como romper el ciclo de los Caskey que comenzó con la llegada de Elinor y con el momento en que entregó a Miriam.Lluviafue el final perfecto para la saga, un libro en el que sucedieron muchas cosas, pudimos ver la evolución de los personajes y cómo algunos caían en repetir ciclos. Pero también pudimos dar el cierre a lo que inició con la riada y la llegada de Elinor.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Questa saga è un capolavoro.Narrativa scritta per essere letta, anzi, divorata, senza darsi arie e senza la consueta prosopopea di tanti scrittori contemporanei che non hanno nulla da dire ma vengono osannati.McDowell pensa solo ai lettori. E confeziona storie e personaggi che si intrecciano alla grande lungo l’intero arco narrativo, mescolando i litigi, le ripicche e le gioie di un racconto familiare pluri-generazionale con un tocco di mistero e horror, firmando pagine capaci di cambiare il ritmo all’intera opera, come fiammate nella notte che commuovono e atterriscono.Sarò per sempre #TeamElinor'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Adiós, queridos Caskey, se os echará de menos. Adiós, Perdido, ha sido un placer conocerte.Y se acabó. Seis entregas después, la lluvia llegó y el ciclo de Perdido se completó. Sin embargo, para el recuerdo, siempre quedará el fenómeno. Porque si Alas de hierro y sus cantos pintados marco el mercado editorial a principio de año, el fenómeno Blackwater quedará también para la historia. Imitando el ritmo original de publicación en 1983, aunque cada dos semanas en lugar de un mes, Blackie Books ha conseguido reunir a lectores (y no tan lectores) en las librerías buscando su dosis, cual droga culebrenesca y serie televisiva quincenal. Diría, que esa es una de las claves de su éxito: el de adoptar un modelo narrativo de consumo participativo, que agradece la conversación y se convierte, como por arte de magia, en moda. Sin embargo, debajo de esa ola publicitaria y espectacular acabado de las portadas y contraportadas de Pedro Oyarbide, diría que se esconde una novela (ya completa) más profunda, bien escrita, adictiva, y lo más importante, para (casi) todos los públicos.Y la lluvia llegó para arrasar todoLa generación de los Caskey que conocimos en 1919 envejece, como es natural en la vida. Los años pasan y nos situamos ya en la década de los años setenta. Sin embargo, la vida continua, como debe ser. Generaciones venideras toman el mando mientras las anteriores ceden el paso. De esta forma Lilah, hija de Frances, y Tommy Lee, hijo de Lucille, son parte del centro de la Lluvia. Sin embargo, aquí, es el momento de cerrar el círculo. Todo principio debe tener un final. Y, por supuesto, Elinor, sigue siendo la protagonista indiscutible. La lluvia llega a Perdido para cerrar el círculo que comenzó con una riada. Un final que parece arrasarlo todo por completo, como la lluvia que llega a su paso, pero que esta vez deja, al menos en nosotros como lectores, una sensación de satisfacción y melancolía, y también, una huella imborrable en el tiempo que hemos pasado junto a ellos. Adiós, familia Caskey. Adiós, Perdido.Más McDowell que nuncaVan cinco volúmenes a la espalda, pero no deja de ser relevante la habilidad de McDowell en cuanto a la escritura. Podemos hablar de que la historia es una sencilla trama generacional, pero no debemos olvidar la capacidad de Blackwater para centrarse en lo que necesita en cada momento. Si hace falta alejarse del foco, lo hace de manera elegante, si necesita ir al detalle, amplia más rápido que el zoom del ordenador, y si quiere ir a la parte más fantástica, no tiene inconveniente. La narrativa esta al servicio de la historia, manteniendo siempre el interés y siendo relevante para el lector. Y lo hace, con otra de sus claves: la sencillez. McDowell no necesita florituras ni segundas lecturas (aunque las tiene), sino que trabaja en cada entrega para construir su epopeya generacional sin grandes sobresaltos, yendo siempre hacia delante y poniendo el rumbo siempre hacia algo nuevo pero que podemos (casi) prever.Un melancólico adiósNo podía faltar en un volumen final como este cierta acumulación de muertes, de cambios en la familia y de sucesos que dan un giro a la situación. Sin embargo, es un final esperado y satisfactorio, acorde con todo lo contado. El drama folletinesco llega a su fin, dejando para el recuerdo una larga trayectoria familiar repleta de momentos tan estelares como inolvidables, como esa conversación sucedida en La casa, o el giro fantástico que nos ofreció La fortuna, mis dos volúmenes predilectos. Cada volumen ha sido una pieza más de una historia más larga y compleja, donde principales y secundarios han calado y tenido su relevancia, haciendo que la despedida, como lectores, sea más complicada que una simple separación. La Lluvia lleva el proceso emocional hasta su clímax y nos deja huérfanos. No hay nada novedoso en su estructura o su desarrollo, pero, sin duda, tiene algo, como el resto de la saga. Ese algo, inexplicable con palabras, que hace que Blackwater sea un fenómeno real y popular.Reseña en el blog:https://boywithletters.blogspot.com/2...'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Los Caskey se despiden, fieles a su estilo, al realismo mágico, a su dinámica familiar afectuosa pero sin exagerar y, cómo no, a su inundado destino.El final de una saga familiar, inquietante y querible.Adiós.

Sono ritornati gli elementi gotici e horror che sono venuti per lo più a mancare nei due volumi precedenti (ci sono stati dei momenti in cui mi è proprio salita l’ansietta) e ci sono stati anche alcuni momenti che mi hanno sorpresa.Cosa che non mi aspettavo proprio: ho persino fatto gli occhi lucidi!Alla fine alla famiglia Caskey ci ho legato quasi come mi lego solitamente alle famiglie di cui leggo. Dico quasi perché forse qui, rispetto ad altre saghe familiari, sebbene ci sia una chiara caratterizzazione dei personaggi, è come se tutti - o quasi - rimanessero fermi su sé stessi, senza evoluzioni particolari.Ma è stato un bel viaggio a Perdido, e se potessi lo rifarei, senza cambiare niente.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3,5. A lo largo de más de seis décadas, la saga de los Caskey ha vivido y crecido en Perdido, un pequeño pueblo de Alabama. Aunque la familia ha ido aumentando con el paso de los años, y por cada muerte un nuevo nacimiento tenía lugar, en los últimos años los niños han dejado de llegar, y pese a que los Caskey nunca fueron tan ricos como ahora y amasan tal fortuna que podrían vivir generaciones y generaciones sin mover un solo dedo, el tiempo pasa para todos, y la mayoría de sus miembros han envejecido, ya que contra le vejez, ni todo el dinero del mundo sirve.Si en su día sentí que la primera entrega era como un tomo introductorio para que el lector entrara en la historia y conociera a sus personajes, siento que Blackwater “Lluvia”, la última parte de la saga, se siente como una despedida. A través de las páginas el lector va despidiéndose de estos personajes, y el autor le da a cada uno su momento. Este detalle me ha gustado mucho, si bien es cierto que, al igual que pasa con el primero, esto provoca que en términos de contenido tenga menos que otros como el segundo, el tercero o el cuarto.Pese a que el desenlace ha sido bastante emotivo y cumple, llego al fin de esta saga de seis tomos, dejándola con una mezcla de sentimientos. Por una parte, me reafirmo en que es entretenidísima, que funciona a modo de culebrón sureño, con toques de terror gótico y algún que otro momento que calificaría de gore, y llena de personajes entrañables con los que es difícil no conectar, especialmente con su gran protagonista, Elinor. Sin embargo, por otra parte, siento que no es una saga que me haya dejado una impronta muy especial, por lo cual, me reafirmo en que su gran atractivo es su capacidad de entretener.Creo que Michael McDowell fue un adelantado a su época y aunque esta saga la escribió a principios de los ochenta, muestra un plantel muy extenso de personajes femeninos poderosos y potentes, cada uno a su manera. No muestra a una sola mujer sumisa o controlada por un hombre, y es una de las cosas que más he disfrutado. Asimismo, y esto puede ser considerado spoiler, es capaz de representar la historia de amor de una pareja lésbica, un romance que es aceptado por la familia y el pueblo, pese a suceder a mitad del siglo XX. El hecho de que el fuese gay sirve, claramente, de explicación para lo avanzado que es a la hora de representar estos personajes femeninos.Sin embargo, hay cierto detalle que aún no comenté, porque he estado las seis entregas esperando con la esperanza de que en algún momento ocurriera, pero nunca pasó, y soy incapaz de no mencionarlo porque me parece que desmerece la obra en cierto sentido. Viendo lo moderno y utópico (en ocasiones) que ha sido el autor en algunas tramas, hay cierto detalle en el que no lo ha sido y me ha chirriado. Resulta que la historia gira en torno a dos sagas familiares, la principal son los Caskey, todos blancos y ricos, y la secundaria, la saga de los Sapp, que son generaciones de familias negras que han prestado servicio en la casa de los primeros, siendo ambas sagas matriarcales.Teniendo en cuenta que a lo largo de las décadas, los Caskey se lían unos con otros, en relaciones que, en ocasiones, resultan hasta moralmente dudosas, me ha resultado especialmente rancio, que ni uno solo de estos romances haya girado en torno a un negro y un blanco. Al final, todo el tiempo estaban los unos en un lugar y los otros en otro. Algo que me ha descolocado totalmente con el tono adelantado del autor. Realmente pensé que en algún momento habría algún amorío que destrozara este límite entre unos y otros, pero nunca ocurrió, y eso me ha decepcionado el conjunto.En definitiva, ¿es “Blackwater” la historia definitiva? No. ¿Me dejará una huella imborrable? Lo dudo. Aún así, es una saga que recomiendo, principalmente porque es divertida, y pese a sus seis tomos, se devora, ya que tiene una prosa sencilla y directa, donde encontraremos un poco de todo, momentos divertidos, momentos de terror y momentos de salseo. Así que si queréis una saga para pasar un rato entretenido, pero sin más pretensiones, “Blackwater” es vuestra saga.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Nel sesto volume, in maniera magistrale Michael McDowell mette a posto gli ultimi tasselli che erano rimasti scoperti.“La diga aveva ceduto simultaneamente in due punti. Sul lato occidentale del Perdido, il punto in cui prima cominciava il ponte era sempre stato instabile.

L’acqua si era aperta brecce sempre piú profonde nell’argine, finché, alle tre e mezzo esatte del mattino, la forza combinata del Perdido e del Blackwater l’aveva sfondato del tutto. Nel giro di pochi istanti, la fila di negozi sul lato orientale di Palafox Street fu spinta dalla parte opposta della strada, fino a sbattere sulla fila di fronte.

This man is the most caring, reckless and loving creature that managed to work his way into my soul. He’s so thoughtful and his inner monologue is so funny. But their banter is even better 🤌❤️\u200d🔥He actually had his own life in this book too. Sometimes dual povs just feel like one because they’re both living the same thing. But this book showed the distinction between their thought processes and how they’re actual individuals, not the same brain.Gosh, 𝗔𝗡𝗔𝗦𝗧𝗔𝗦𝗜𝗔 𝗔𝗟𝗟𝗘𝗡 was so relatable. It was so hard seeing her go through all that shit but watching her grow stronger and healthier was so rewarding. I’m so proud of how she dealt with things.I loved how she became amazing friends with the team and cared about them like family. I loved her for saying what she wanted and sticking to it too. I’m so glad she had a spine and stood up for herself when it mattered.I’m genuinely so impressed this is a debut novel and I cannot WAIT to read more from Hannah Grace!!Whew!

I haven’t read something so unentertaining in a long time and only wasted my time for ten long hours.The book was way too long and too much. Too much drama, too much plot, too much was happening. I was half way into it when I already forgot what happened before because it.was.just.to.much, of everything. I wanted to dnf this book 10% into it, because it was so boring, but I never dnf a book before so I wanted to keep going. But it was just awful. I couldn’t wait until I finally (FINALLY) got to the end. (Have to confess I also skipped a few parts, mainly Anastasias chapters, halfway through the book because these awful, boring scenes weren’t bearable anymore after a few hours into it.)Aaron was a walking red flag since his introduction. I didn’t like him for a second (he gave me major bipolar disorder vibes with his mood swings). His character was awful und I didn’t enjoy a second of him being in this book. I understand that he was the main villain, but he shouldn’t have so much scene time. The main part of this book was for me hating him and I couldn’t enjoy anything beside because the next second he was back again and my mood fell. I don’t understand how people could keep up with him for so long, he clearly was a bad person (even if dumb Anastasia says other wise).Sabrine I liked just fine, but it’s doesn’t sit right with me reading about her behaviors while she is representing a muslim girl (or I suspect she is muslim because most of Algerians are), but I don’t know if she is for sure.Beside her there were too many side characters, I can’t even remember everyone who was there and why they were there.It’s shocking but the one person I disliked more than Aaron was Anastasia herself. Her whole character was so so so unlikable for me. Her freak-outs, how bad she treated Nathan even though he was always nice to her. The on, off, cold, hot she gave him and how she only liked him when she was drunk was annoying and irritating. Sometimes she acted like the biggest child and I hate how no one stood up to her and beat her in place, because she was such a mean person sometimes to the people around her (mainly Nathan who she always attacks without even knowing if he done anything wrong). She deserved to end up losing everything she worked towards. These „getting under his skin“ actions were unnecessary and childish. It was not funny at all and I hate Nathan for playing along with her every time she fucked him over again.It’s paradox how she is portrayed as a dominant, strong willed character with everyone else, but she lets Aaron walk over her over and over again till the last 2 chapters.I really hated her for every second she was present in this book more than I hated Aaron.What was Ryan’s purpose? He was a major part for the first half of the book but in the end he wasn’t even mention. Like he didn’t exist and the author just forgot he was there once. But he also is a person I didn‘t like. He was nice and all but he was interested in Olivia, wants more while laying half naked in a bed with another woman ? Kuddling her ? I wouldn’t want to talk to a boy who is seeing other girls beside me, let alone doing sleepovers with his ex-fuck-buddy.The only part of this book I liked was Nathan’s character. He was cute and polite, respectful, a green flag boy the whole time (even when he was mad that is girlfriend was fucked over and blinded by another man, as he should). He was attentive and always courteous. He cared for others more than he cared for himself. He took care of Anastasia, of his team, his sister. He was totally a golden retriever with a heart of gold. I wish he hadn’t ended up with Anastasia. He clearly deserves something so much better than her. Someone who loves him as equal as he loves, and Anastasia’s wasn’t that. She was just awful to him, treats him poorly and didn’t deserve him or his kindness.This one star is for Nathan and Nathan only.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'To sum up my thoughts very quickly… there was too much going on and yet somehow there was also absolutely nothing going on - so out of a weird mix of annoyance and boredom, I DNFd it at 50%But in case your interested in details…I should have realized right away that I wasn’t gonna like this book when I had a really hard time digesting the writing. There was something about it that wasn’t flowing smoothly from the pages into my brain and therefore I was reading it really slowly and found myself putting it down a lot (which is a very bad sign)Then there was also so much info-dumping for all the side characters. It felt like she already pre-planned out a multi book companion series and was trying too hard to get us invested in all of the side characters by giving them each so much detail and page time.We’ve got her best friend (Liv) who’s starting to get with his best friend (Robbie). Her skating partner (Aaron) who’s mentally and emotionally abusive to her (but she doesn’t realize this even though she’s been in therapy for years and supposedly is really good at expressing her thoughts and figuring out how she’s feeling… but okay.) There’s also a bunch of guys from the hockey team that end up becoming a part of this large friend group that’s forming (JJ, Henry, Russ, Bobby + more). Did I forget to mention Robbie? Yea, he’s Anastasia’s fuck buddy at the beginning of the book because she doesn’t have any interest in committing to a relationship because she just wants to focus on her training and skating career…. but it’s okay because early on he ends up starting a relationship with someone that Liv (Anastasia’s best friend) absolutely hates… so now her and Robbie are just best friends who sleep in the same bed together without shirts on sometimes… nbd (🙄)Then there’s Nate. He’s a sweetie and I liked him enough - but not enough to keep reading. Especially because I really didn’t like Anastasia. As for their relationship… I didn’t like that either. It was a-lot of tell and no show - and the few times there was show and they actually had a minute alone with each other, they would just get it on (yawn).As for the actual plotline - there was none. Yup. None — Basically all these characters meet for the first time when they are forced to start sharing an ice rink and that’s basically just a setup for them all to become friends… and then the rest of the story (from what I’ve read) is just watching them do everyday college shit like go to parties and bars and study and go to training and boring things like that.The funny thing is, is that right at the halfway point is when we get the second half of what was mentioned in the synopsis… where Aaron (the abusive skating partner) causes a ton of drama by getting injured and blaming it on Nate - so Nate ends up getting benched for a while and decides to fill in as Anastasia’s new skating partner…. and that’s right around where I gave up on the story.… and I’m just sayin… don’t put something in the synopsis if it’s not gonna happen until midway through - IMO the synopsis should only have information that takes place in the first 50-100 pages… but what do I know?So to sum all that up again… there were too many characters, too much drama, and somehow there was nothing actually going on other than all these people hanging out a bunch and Anastasia getting it on with Nate every time she was drunk and horny.Is it crazy to say that I have so much more I could complain about?? Even after my longest review ever?? It’s fine, I’ll stop myself here… but just know… I had more.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Is this what kids are into nowadays? Am I too ancient, too old, too out of touch with reality to understand what gen Z likes?""stop slapping your balls this loud""""her ass smells so good""""can Lola really hear my balls?""Yes, these are all quotes from this book.Well... there was zero plot. Every single character talked like they were 15 and just found out about sex through giphs on tumblr. And honestly, sex is the only thing they talk about. Every single page. There is nothing but: who\'s hooking up with who, how many kinky things they\'ve done, waking up and training while wasted from the parties they went to the night before, and how loud his balls are against her thighs when they\'re having sex.The FMC has a hardcore/severe eating disorder. AND THERE IS LEGIT A SENTENCE WHERE THEY EXCUSE A GUY KNOCKING SOMEONE UP BY SAYING:oh, it wasn\'t his fault, he doesn\'t know a lot about pregnancy. he\'s a good guy, he\'s just a 25 year old MAN who doesn\'t understand how sex works. so you gotta give him a pass.But yeah, if you want to know what this one is about, it\'s just a wattpad book that hasn\'t been edited. But I guess these are the books that get publisher deals nowadays.There are too many characters that are introduced in a very confusing way. They get yelled at by their coaches every 10 pages and talk about sex and alcohol for the remaining pages. Rinse and repeat. They all end up sharing a rink and spend a lot more time together, yatta, yatta.It\'s not the worst book I have ever read. But... It is written like a Wattpad story. Repetitive, long and childish.

Stupid instalove shit with a self righteous poorly executed “girlboss” mc who’s whole personality is being sassy and shallow but really she’s fighting demons 🥺🥺🥺🥺 SHUT UP and the love interest is somehow even worse at the beginning of the book he’s said to be in love with a girl and wants to marry her but completely forgets she even exists upon meeting Anastasia? By the way “Stassie” is one of the ugliest nicknames I’ve ever heard in my life. Bitch isn’t the Loch Ness monster.SECOND OF ALL the way he’s immediately like “omg I would do anything to hear Stassie’s laugh again 😍” SHUT THE FUXKKKKK UP YOU JUST MET HER PLEASE LIKE it’s actually painful and So Fucking Forced too. They don’t have two molecules of chemistry to rub together. You can tell the author was literally forcing infatuation on Nathan.THIRD OF ALL the plotline is ass. The author is clearly going for an enemies-to-lovers but Anastasia shouldn’t have even been mad at Nathan in the first place because it was over a minuscule predicament that wasn’t even remotely his fault. “I was planning on being mad at you forever” OVER FUCKING WHAT???? Id get it if she didn’t like him because he’s a useless pushover douchebag who’s literally obsessed with her but she doesn’t even gaf about that. It’s just cuz his teammates ex girlfriends boyfriend or some shit, who he has nothing to do with, fucked up their rink.FOURTH OF ALL nobody in this book has any decorum or home training. Why does Anastasia never wear any goddamn underwear to SOCIAL OUTINGS?Nessie went commando to someone’s BIRTHDAY PARTY. And I’m not sure about you but I wouldn’t want my boyfriend sleeping in another woman’s fucking bed because they’re “best friends” *COUGH* RYAN *COUGH*. And these bitches are talking about sex and literally Having sex in Ubers like MANNERS. THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE FUCKING CAR OH MY GOD.And for a final note: just how much I hate this stupid useless couple😊 Nathan saying he won’t fuck Anastasia when she’s drunk and 1) Nessie getting literally offended by him saying no and going back to being a complete self righteous bitch FOR NO REASON (for a modern day “woke” book the word “no” doesn’t seem to mean as much when you “don’t take rejection well”! (Stfu!!! No Consent is no consent!)) and 2) they fuck literally a couple days after even though she’s drunk AGAIN.

I didn't like the heroine because she was presented as someone determined and focused on her career as a figure skater, but all her actions towards that goal made her look childish and annoying for me because of the way she treated those around her, as if they were disposable, and almost as if she was doing them a favor by giving them the time of day, when at the end of the day she was always the one who came back for more because of that feeling of familiarity she didn’t had before.2. There were too many side characters that I couldn't keep track of, and at some points they stole the limelight in this book, while others became more and more annoying with each intervention (Henry please shut up, you stopped being quirky like 20 chapters ago). Also I don't wanna be like that, but I really feel like the author tried too hard to score those rep points while not even using google translate properly.3. And then the plot dragged and dragged, forever and ever, AMEN. I heard this was a Wattpad story before and maybe that's why the whole plot feels a bit cut off, but gosh, a new conflict after a few chapters? It was a few conflicts too much.

I’d throw my last punch defending you because you deserve to have someone be that person for you, and there’s no one more qualified for the job than me.”i’m embarrassed to say i was excited to read this book. am i being dramatic? maybe. but listen:i genuinely tried liking this book.i put up with the boring first few chapters. but wow!! all of a sudden it picks up! is that supposed to make me like it more? who knows. i have too much self respect to continue reading this series, even if it does get “better,” so this is the first and last book i’m reading of hannah grace’s. from the very beginning, i didn’t like the main character that much. she gave me pick me vibes and it’s clear the author tries to make her different from other fmc’s. while i appreciate this effort, i could not bring myself to like her.one thing i did like? ryan! they had a dynamic that i loved and they cared abt each other in a way that wasn’t overbearing. not to mention the way anastasia was supportive of his relationship with olivia! i have to admit it was a nice change and it was completely understandable. i found his character to be so sweet and i wish we got more of his and anastasia’s friendship. i also liked sasha & anastasia’s friendship despite the embarrassing things that happened when they first met. i am never getting over it.“I’m going to teach you how to be nice.”“I’m sure there are plenty of things you can teach me, Nathan, but being nice isn’t one of them. I’m a delight.”my main problem with the main character:she tried too hard to be grumpy.she was also super overdramatic and she swore to hate hockey players bc of a typical stereotype but one interaction and she realizes she starts to like them. the next thing she does is complain bc she was only willing to like henry. it was infuriating and annoying with how she tried hating all the hockey players. her inner dialogue was so hard to put up with because of the way she simply talked. she was WAY too stubborn for my liking and i did not like it at all. i’m so glad she gave up that behavior bc i wouldn’t have been able to stand the book if it continued like that.i thought there were times where i did seem to understand anastasia. she reminded me of monica geller with the way she was described! from her competitive nature to the way she was “compulsively organized”. it’s also clear how she cares a lot about the people she loves. however they differed in many different ways with how “grumpy” she is and her demeanor around new people.a small spoiler for this quote possibly!!“It felt good hearing him make plans for the future, and I could pretend I don’t know why, but denial is useless at this point. Everything he says makes me melt, and half the time I don’t know how to react, so I kiss him, then things escalate, and before I know it, I’m screaming his name and seeing stars.”—this was one of the many examples within this book that shows there’s no plot, it’s justsex driven.overall, this book wasso slow. it might seem fast paced with the events, but it slowly eased into a normal routine of them fucking every other chapter. it becomes so boring to read the same damn thing every time. it throws you off at the beginning just as an excuse to slow down the plot and focus on them doing it. however this book was great with keeping everything consistent. the amount of pages for each chapter stayed relatively the same and they didn’t favor one pov over another!if u saw my reaction while i read this book, you’d be familiar with these quotes.“I swear to God I will leave you in this airport,” Nate grumbles, slapping my ass, laughing when the noise causes an elderly couple to turn around and look at us, making my cheeks blush.”“It’s like he flicks a switch somewhere and suddenly it’s Niagara Falls between my legs.”mid way this book became entertaining. not for the plot, which remainedboring and gave us nothing. but i genuinely laughed out loud bc of how cringy the writing was sometimes & how it gave off wattpad vibes. the writing itself was entertaining. there was so much smut and usually i don’t mind but there was unnecessarily too much in this book. what was the purpose?? i was going to give this book 3 stars at this point. things were looking up and my rating slowly increased. i also liked the banter between the characters! it was pretty enjoyable on my part so there’s thatusually books that bring comfort involve the found family trope, but it’s not as present in this book mainly bc it focuses on friendships between the boys and anastasia, but even then it’s barely talked about there. plus, the main focus was the relationship between nate & anastasia, which in of itself is all abt sex. my favorite part is definitely the cooking lessons that jj and anastasia had together. cutest!!context: literally just gray sweatpants“He’s in a Maple Hills Titans T-shirt and gray sweats, and I hate myself for being a woman swayed by a man in gray sweatpants. Shit. No, there will be no swaying.””Gray, obviously, because Nathan Hawkins is a man who was most definitely written by a woman.”i hate nathan with a burning passion. this is the rare occasion where iWANTEDa third act conflict. i usually hate them butthey needed it!!he was below the bare minimum. i truly have no idea how anastasia put up with him. she likes a man who wears gray sweatpants and claims he is written by a woman. i wear gray sweatpants!! does that make me written by a woman? i would hope so but that’s besides the point.not every person who wears sweatpants immediately makes them written by a woman!spoilers from this point on“You think he’s going to manipulate her into forgiving him and then she won’t need you anymore. You like being needed by her. It makes you feel important. You know Aaron hates you and you think he’s going to keep her away from you. Which just shows you don’t know how strong she is, or truly understand how much she loves you.”“I shouldn’t have to scream that I’m not naïve or being manipulated for Nathan to trust my judgment. I shouldn’t have to beg him to understand that there is a difference between friendship and partnership.”these quotes single handedly ruined this book for me and made me hate nathan.nathan desperately needs therapy.i’m surprised she put up with the attitude that he showed her. i wanted him to be able to work out his feelings on his own so she would never have to put up with a man who cannot communicate his feelings bc communication is key!! instead they got pissed at each other and would put off arguements. then they don’t see each other for a few days and everything is fixed! i do appreciate the boys knocking some sense into him.“There’s a warm, full feeling in my heart when I’m around this team. It’s unfamiliar but familiar at the same time; a contradiction, I know, but so specific that it feels like it was specifically designed for me. It’s the feeling I didn’t know I needed until these guys crashed their way into my life three months ago.”speaking of the boys:i don’t see why people like henry.he made a LOT of backhanded comments to everyone and whether or not he can tell if it’s mean, i’m surprised they put up with him for so long. i do see that he cares for anastasia but from the beginning he was so blunt. there was ONE scene of henry being kind. he wasn’t even funny! he just had no filter and just cannot control his honesty. if he was able to control his honesty, i’d probably like him better.this book was so fast paced for the characters. this all happened within the span of 3 months.3 MONTHS.i get that the idea of the story is supposed to be that they don’t have any miscommunications and have a “healthy” relationship but i’ve found some problems within this situation. they move way too quickly and the way they address it as “we’ve spent so much time together so we’re built different” does not work for me. don’t get me wrong, they had their cute moments but it wasn’t enough to suffice for me.they don’t fight when they’re “frenemies” which i do appreciate but it’s obvious they wanted different things from the beginning. despite nathan knowing what anastasia wanted, they still got jealous whenever one hung out with another person and they didn’t address it. i feel like they sugarcoated everything and it’s clear anastasia doesn’t think on it much simply because she does not know how he feels. i’ve never met a man who’s happy to be her friend rather than upset that she just wants to be friends.here’s where the book gets confusing: they are obviously involved with one another but not exactly in a relationship type way. they don’t even get together until chapter 30. i honestly stopped caring for their relationship bc i was that done with this book. i thought nathan was desperate and i just did not like them together all that much. sure, they can be cute but their whole relationship and personality revolves around fucking one another and when they were away all they would think abt is alone time between them.the supposed “plot” on the back doesn’t happen until mid way. sure, the ice rink breaks as soon as u jump into the book abt 2 chapters in but the second plot point took too long to happen. i wish it would’ve happened sooner to let the book pick up quicker and become shorter. also i loathe aaron in this book. do i really need to talk abt him? i’m pretty sure everyone hates him.i personally would not forgive nathan for what he said at the end. that might just be me being petty but i don’t want to take shit from a man!! i’d deserve better than someone who can’t work out their feelings bc i got my own bullshit to deal with. sometimes i couldn’t see the reasoning behind the things the characters did bc of the way they justified it. sometimes justification works butnot in this case!TW WITHIN THIS BOOK: EATING DISORDERi want to address the eating disorder that is part of the plot within the book but i also don’t want to be insensitive just in case. i just want to say i’m glad it was addressed and talk about! i didn’t like how late they addressed it into the book thoone more thing: i’m convinced them “playing house” is another way of them boning and making it their entire personality for the entirety of a few hours. this book really pushed my limits. it also sounds like something roleplay relatedpre-reviewi had a nightmare i rated this book 5 stars. rtc'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'what in the insta-lovey-wattpad-pick-me-shit-every-trope-in-the-fucking-world did I just read?this review is longer than aaron’s dick yet smaller than his ego.dnf @ chapter 5update:i read wildfire. sometimes i wonder if my lack of brain cells will be my downfall'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Can we take a moment and talk about therealstar of the book?✨Henry✨He was the best character in this whole book, i was practically frothing at the mouth whenever he appeared, I swear if this man was real i would be on my knees.......to propose, get your minds out of the gutter.He literally so cute and rediculously funny, he says what he thinks in the moment and doesn\'t give a damn.For example Nate wanted to talk to Stassie and JJ said lets get some drink (to let them have some alone time) and Henry said why? you have a drink and so do iGod i love that man, and he got like maybe maximum of 20 pages of screen timeLets not forget :"" it was fun staying in Henry\'s room.

She’s come a long way from the small town where she grew up—she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. And when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life seems too good to be true.Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan—her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.","[{'rating': 2, 'content': '➥ 2 Stars *:･ﾟ✧""People spend so much time wondering why the women don\'t leave. Where are all the people who wonder why the men are even abusive? Isn\'t that where the only blame should be placed?""━━━━━━━━━━━ ♡ ━━━━━━━━━━━tw: graphic domestic violence, graphic attempted rape, suicide, depression, alcohol abuse, depressionUpdate:One of my Goodreads friends broughtthis articleto my attention: an article by domesticshelters.org that outlines the harmfulness of this book. Definitely worth the read.I’ve rewritten this review three times now, andeach time I’ve felt it necessary to lower my rating.I don’t intend for this to be a hot take. I’m not trying to be unique or quirky for disliking a popular book but every day I grow more and more concerned with the number of people who misinterpret and romanticize this book. There will be spoilers in this review.I’d like to begin by acknowledging Colleen Hoover’s intent with this book and how I believe it is a serious problem.Firstly,Colleen Hoover has expressed her disapproval and dislike for trigger warnings.She expressed that“as a fellow reader with my fair share of past experiences, I understand that there are issues some people do not want to read about. But as a writer, there are many things I don’t want revealed in the blurbs of my books.”This is extremely irresponsible and inconsiderate of an author.Furthermore, this book has been and is marketed as a love triangle andColleen Hoover employs the fact that Ryle is an abusive fucker as a plot-twist.In the author’s note, she states that “In the past, I’ve always said I write for entertainment purposes only. I don’t write to educate, persuade or inform. This book is different.”Yet, she continues to format this more serious book, similarly.Furthermore, although I understand that Colleen“wanted to write something realistic to the situation my mother was in – a situation a lot of women find themselves in”, I feel that Ryle was very different to her father.This coming explanation is just my presumption and random thought process. I could have greatly misinterpreted what Colleen went through and I do not mean to be disrespectful.I do not doubt that domestic abuse can be very different, but I believe the fact that Colleen’s father was an alcoholic has a huge impact on her final opinion of him. One could argue that her father needed help, and that although he is to blame, it did not come purely from malintent and manipulation. I am not saying that he is redeemable by any means, only that part of the violence can be due to an unintentional factor. Ryle still ends up having custody over the baby. This is infuriating to me.But we see that she wrote it this way because Colleen still had a relationship with her abusive father after her mother divorced him.Then we have the way that Colleen\'s father continues to (in my opinion) manipulate her by showing kind, good aspects of himself, like agreeing and encouraging Colleen’s stepfather to walk her down the isle rather than him. Just a thought or something to possibly consider.And in this book, we see Ryle presented as, not a bad person, instead, only a""person who does bad things"".Now, I\'ve been thinking about this line.I wonder if it was Colleen’s intention to have Ryle say this line to purposefully show how he manipulates Lily into having this mindset or if Colleen really does think this way.Ryle is indeed a bad person, and abuser who is irredeemable. I understand and agree that it is at times, difficult to label someone as “bad” or “good” as it is more complicated than that. But there comes a point, that person is a bad person (for instance, when he tries to horrifically rape her and guilt-tripped Lily with his trauma). Colleen attempts to evoke confliction in the reader by writing in that Ryle donates to charity. Yet, this is not enough. One donation does not make you a good person, especially when compared to the severe harm that you’ve caused others. I cannot believe that after Ryle attempted to rape Lily, there are still Ryle apologists out there. That moment was absolutely mortifying.Regardless, the general plotline of this book is supposed to be that Ryle starts off as being a kind, loveable man with whom Lily and the reader fall in love with. But, his abusive and manipulative tendencies are slowly revealed until it becomes clear that he is an abuser and that this is a case of domestic abuse. However,from the beginning of the book, Ryle is already portrayed as a concerningly violent and manipulative man.We are introduced to his character when Lily finds him kicking a chair out of anger, something unacceptable and very worrying. Later on,he begs and successfully coerces Lily into having sex with him, purely and solely because he wants to.Unfortunately, at this point in the story, many people still like, possibly even love, Ryle. This is not the ""turning point"" per se.I’ve also recently seen many people criticizing Colleen Hoover’s ability to write a healthy relationship and I’m beginning to agree. Although I remember enjoying Ugly Love, it was certainly unhealthy, specifically in the way that our female main character was treated. Then I began to read ""November 9"" and was utterly mortified by the way Ben, our love interest, acted. There are plenty of reviews with quotes etc. that show how horribly and scarily Ben treated Fallon from the beginning, before the plot twist.So, I conclude that Colleen’s failure to properly structure a base for the story to build upon was a main concern.In regards to Ryle’s trauma,it is something that he weaponizes to manipulate and guilt-trip Lily.It does not excuse the abuse and I think it’s gravely concerning for people to blame the abuse on his trauma. Although it’s understandable to feel bad for what he had to go through, it is all used to manipulate and abuse Lily.Then we have Atlas. When I first read this book, I was quite taken with how caring and sweet Lily and Atlas’ childhood romance seemed to be. But upon reflection, I’ve become more and more concerned by Atlas’ presence in this book at all.I’ve seen countless girls swooning over the“I know it wasn’t a pity fuck, Lily. I was there”line, yetAtlas had sex with Lily while she was a minor.I question why Colleen Hoover would choose to make it that way. It’s extremely unnecessary and the illegality of it could have been easily avoided had she chosen for them to be the same age.This again shows Colleen’s inability to write healthy relationships.Furthermore, I found that the side romance in general greatly took away from the purpose of the book.The fact that Lily had to be saved by another man is truly a damaging thing to portray. Many women who experience domestic abuse do not have the option to leave just because there is a better man out there and it’s also damaging to make it seem that Lily is simply picking between Ryle or Atlas.Moreover, this expands my discontent with howColleen chose to shove in aspects of her usual work to something so serious.A side love story was truly unnecessary for this, but I believe Colleen knew that if she wrote something without romance, it would not sell. Can I blame her for that? I’m not quite sure, but it certainly does not please me.Deriving from what I’ve mentioned so far, particularly about Ryle,it bothers me how little conclusion Colleen offers at the end of the book.I have had to have conversation after conversation with people who misinterpreted the book, who still forgive Ryle and who think of “It Ends With Us” as a romance book. For a while, my challenge question (for friend requests) was “What is your favourite (dark) romance book and why?” And I cannot tell you the number of times people answered with “It Ends With Us”. Some people write in their reviews that even though Ryle was not Lily’s ultimate partner and just because it “did not work out”, they will still have love for Ryle in their heart and think that he just needs help. And unfortunately, I don’t think these people are to blame.With Colleen still allowing Ryle to have custody, it almost allows for a small redemption for his character. And I believe at the end of the book, Colleen should have written one page with the cycle of abuse and how it was shown throughout the novel, and a conclusion expressing that if you love Ryle,you should not,because everything that he did, he did itconsciously and with purpose, through manipulation and guilt-tripping(weaponizing his trauma). I do appreciate however, that she included the domestic abuse hotlines.I also thinkit is unacceptable for people to be recommending this book as just a “sad book” or a “book to make you cry”, becausediminishing a book that explores such a difficult and serious topic like domestic abuse, to an object that simply serves the purpose of evoking emotions from you, is extremely disrespectful and shallow.Especially considering that this is such a personal book to Colleen Hoover.Another thing that I found to be really damaging about this book isthe audience.There is this#coquetteaesthetic on tiktok that I am sure you are aware of. I really to like the look of it etc. But it is a theme among this aesthetic to read books like ""It Ends With Us"" and ""Lolita"". I believe both of these texts are greatly misinterpreted, especially considering that it is often young girls who are reading these books from the ages of 11-15. Ignoring Lolita as that is a different topic,I am nearly certain that these girls buy books like “It Ends With Us” purely for the cover.It\'s pink. And it fits the aesthetic.I see people saying that they ""love"" “It Ends With Us” and I find it greatly concerning. What do you love about it? I see people ignoring Lily\'s plotline and just adoring Atlas and his whole ""I know it wasn\'t a pity fuck, Lily. I was there."" They\'ve transformed this as something to romanticise. Not to mention thatI also see girls giggle at what seems to be a little inside joke of theirs when they quote""where did you get the magnet lily""or""you fell down the stairs"".I am really beginning to think that this book has done more harm than good.The writing wasn’t something I had a problem with.When I see people criticize Colleen Hoover, it tends to be becausethey call her writing “wattpad writing” which is stupid, because people will say that any contemporary romance has “wattpad writing”.That’s not a great criticism, they should actually elaborate. Other than the quotes that I’ve disagreed with like“There’s no such thing as a bad person, only people who do bad things”, I found that Colleen Hoover’s writing flows well and that she has some iconic, well thought out quotes.I wasn’t a huge fan of Lily writing her letters to Ellenand I didn’t really care at first, but in the Acknowledgement section of “It Ends With Us”, Colleen actually says thankyou to Ellen DeGeneres saying that she is“light when it comes to darkness”. Considering what an awful person everyone knows that Ellen is, I again struggle to understand why Colleen chose this specific detail when she could have chosen someone that was a much better person and influence. *I have been informed that because this book was written in 2016, Ellen was not known to be a bad person,although I still question Colleen\'s decision to make Lily write letters to a talk show host.Veering off that topic and coming back to my problems with Ryle, is thatI strongly despised how he cared for Lily when she was pregnant.I felt that Ryle cared more about the baby than Lily, and it continues to portray women as baby machines who are made to serve a purpose.The way he cared for her stomach and touched her stomach rather than her. It’s disgusting.Something that also boiled my blood isthe internal misogynythat I see Colleen weave into her books.Lily chooses to not decide whether to divorce Ryle or not until after she has the baby becauseshe believes that her decision would be affected by her hormones.What the fuck?????? Was the fact that he tried to rape you and then he beat you not clear enough?Furthermore, when Lily is trying to explain to Ryle that she wants to divorce him, she tells him something along the lines of“what if this baby girl came home to you and told you ‘daddy, this boy hits me but he apologized and said he wouldn’t do it again’, what if she came home with bruises”, and only then does that garner any sympathy from Ryle.This situation parallels the instances when men only feel remorse for things like sexual assault when they are told ‘what if it was your mother and sister’.It’s horrible and it made me deeply upset that I’ve seen reviews admiring how Ryle was “understanding” after Lily explained that to him.I believe Lily was a strong character to a degree and I agreed with the way she responded to certain things (or I would have done the same), but there are times where I would have been gone, and Lily stayed (like when Ryle begged her for sex). Still, you can really tell she did have a certain level of logic and reason, and tried to confront Ryle.Something that really bugged me was the characterDevinand how Colleen Hoover writes him asthegay stereotype.He\'s overly touchy with Lily, touching her breasts and pulling down her bra without her consent. This is truly such a disgusting and rude way to portray characters of the lgbtq+ community, especially considering that Colleen Hoover rarely diversifies her books(very few poc + lgbtq characters). It mainly frustrates me because Colleen Hoover clearly has a huge income from the sales of her books, and that she cannot be bothered to get sensitivity readers or better editors for these things is so concerning.Another thing that was kind of unnecessary was this line:“A 2-year-old girl will have the same name even when she’s 22, Lily Bloom. Names aren’t something we eventually grow out of.”I understand the meaning behind this sentence, suggesting that parents should put thought into their children\'s names, and that it should suit an adult as much as a child. But I also understand that this can be seen as quite inconsiderate towards transgender people, and just people who change their names in general, because that\'s obviously possible too.There are just so many things that could have been easily avoided, and for these things to not be noticed and fixed is quite lazy of the author.Despite my problems with this book, I think the general idea that Colleen Hoover tried to present in this book was executed decently well at times, hence my two stars.This is a very difficult read, especially if you relate to any of it at all so please do check trigger warnings and be careful because it can be very uncomfortable to see yourself in someone like Lily, or in her position. Much love to anyone who has been through anything like this, I hope you’re okay <3━━━━━━━━━━━ ♡ ━━━━━━━━━━━'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""::: SPOILER-FREE REVIEW :::Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we’ll never get back.HOLY WOW!It Ends With Usis one of the mostpowerfulbooks of 2016 and one of the most raw, honest, inspiring, and profoundly beautiful stories I've ever read. It wasn’t anything like what I expected, but it delivered so much more than I ever hoped for. This is the kind of book that I want to give to every woman and just be like… READ THIS BOOK. NOW. Come to think of it, all the men should read it too. EVERYONE should read this book. Absolutely everyone. It's a story of unshakable love and finding the strength to make the right choice in the hardest situation. I honestly don't think I've ever been prouder of a heroine. I've loved Colleen Hoover's books for a long time because she always writes unique stories... and this one left a lasting mark on my heart. It is a MUST-READ!!This is a completelyspoiler-free review. I'm not even going to add the blurb or tell you what this book is about. It's a Colleen Hoover book. That should be enough to tell you it's amazing. But I really feel that you should just dive into this book without knowing anything about the plot. To be honest, I'm the usually the kind of reader who likes to know every little thing about what to expect in advance, but I've really learned to trust Colleen's writing and her storytelling so even I went into this book without knowing anything at all... and I was blown away by the story!This book isunputdownable. You'll notice as you read that there are no good stopping points. None at all. I began reading it late at night and every time I tried to put it down to go to sleep, I just had to get back up and keep reading because I couldn't stop thinking about it. I didn't finish until almost 5AM but my gosh was it ever worth it!Of all the heroines I've ever read, Lily was most certainly one of the ones I admired the most. I knew loved her from the first few pages, but having finished the book, I truly couldn't be prouder of her. Her strength and conviction over the course of this story made her into a heroine I'd want every girl and woman to read about and look up to. She was so real and vulnerable as we all are, but the strength with which she took control of her life was admirable on such a deep level. I just wanted to hug her and cheer. I don't think I've been this proud of a fictional character before.There's an incrediblypowerful messagein this book that is very subtly woven in from the start. It begins in the first chapter, but you don't yet realize howsignificanteach of these moments truly are... and as you read more, these pieces of the story come together forming a scenario that gives such a raw, honest portrayal of an incredibly relevant issue. I'm not mentioning it on purpose because I don't want you to expect it.The fact that it's unexpected for you as the reader is very important because it's also unexpected for the heroine.As she begins to realize what kind of situation she's in, so do you. And this realization very much allows you to experience her journeywithher.The only thing I want to address head on is the question of the 'love triangle' because a few of you have read the blurb and have asked about it. All I want to say is to please try and move away from that thought. I don't want to spoil the plot at all, but that is so not what this book is about. That is not the point, or the focus. Whatever it is you're thinking this book is, just trust me -- it's so much bigger than that. Seriously, trust Colleen. I did.As a romance reader, I found this book incredibly refreshing. As much as I adore the romance genre (and I really do), it sometimes can get a little repetative. As both an avid reader and a blogger, I'm always looking for books that step outside the lines a little; ones that do something different or take the issues a little deeper. This book represented exactly what I wish I could be reading all the time -- not this literal story, but just the fact that it went in such a different direction and gave me such an unexpected story that left me with such a strong message.One of the things that intrigued me the most and had me wondering when I heard about this book was what the title really meant -- and there's this very specific moment when the title is echoed in the story that just had such astrongimpact as I read it. That was my cheer moment. I just sat back and went 'woah!'. The title is truly perfect.In order to write this review, I went back over the book a second time and one thing I noticed strongly was how many intricate layers there were to the story that I couldn't possibly have known about in my first read. I loved that this is one of those books you experience differently (in a good way) both the first and second time though.I have to say that this book would make aseriously amazing movie. I could picture every scene so clearly as I read. This is also such an incredibly relevant story for many people -- whether they've personally been through what happened to Lily or they know of someone who has -- so I really do hope that one day this makes it to the big screen.My copy of this book is literally filled with highlighted quotes in every single chapter but I made a conscious decision not to add any to this review because I really truly do not want to give anything away about the story. Just trust me and jump into this story blind. I promise that it is a reading experience you don't want to miss.This began as one of my most highly anticipated books of 2016 and it is now of my top favorite books of the year. I was unable to put it down from the moment I started reading and I know that this is one of those profoundly beautiful and unforgettable stories that will stay with me for a long time. I highly recommend it toeveryone!That’s what fifteen minutes can do to a person. It can destroy them.It can save them.Rating: 5+ STARS!

My name is Kelly . . . .Also, I spoil things, so back away quickly if you don’t want this one to be ruined for you.My glaring 1 Star in a sea of 5s probably makes it pretty clear that I detested this book, but please refrain from fetching your torches and pitchforks for a moment and take note that not only did Ijust 5 Star a CoHo Story two weeks ago(as well as shoved it down everyone’s throats I possibly could), but also I want to make all of the sexuals with Miles Archer and will fight anyone for dibs on his imaginary lurv making. I didn’t pick this up in order to hate on it. I’m one of you . . . . sometimes. Definitely not this time, but lots of times. And this is why I don’t ever give up on Hoover novels. I never know how I’m going to react.Allow me to explain what went wrong for me with this one . . .Let’s start with the obvious annoyances that seem to be in nearly every NA book that drive me batshit before getting to the real nitty gritty. First, the character names. Ryle, Lily Bloom and Atlas???????Is it against the law tonotuse absolutely ridiculous (™Ron2.0) names in these books????Second . . . .“Your lips. I love how they’re as red as your hair.”According to Google (all hail Google) less than 2% of the world’s population has red hair, and yet 99.998% of all NA leading ladies do. Just stahp.Third, non-existent chemistry. In this story Lily and Ryle meet by chance on a rooftop after experiencing respective miserable days. In a matter of minutes Lily goes from worrying the stranger on the roof could be a psycho killer/rapist to getting into his super sexy (NOT) pick-up lines . . .“If you wouldn’t sleep with someone you just met . . .” His eyes meet mine again. “Exactly how far would you go?”Ewww. She already said thanks but no thanks freakshow so STFU.Now let’s move on to the real big issue. I took a gander at my friends’ reviews before I started typing this and noticed my buddyChelseawas the only other naysayer in the batch. She summed it upperfectlywhen she talked about the massive amounts of emotional manipulation that was forced down the readers’ throats in order to make them feel all the things.It’s a running joke with my friends/family/co-workers that I have a robot heart. And for the majority of the time it’s true. I generally experience two emotions – happiness and annoyance. But even a robot like me can be manipulated into having a feeling/crying the ugly tears like a Kardashian once in a blue moon (*coughMe Before Youcough*). This time, though? It was like a flashing neon sign . . . .To begin with, our first leading male Atlas is a homeless teenager who Lily befriends/eventually loses her virginity. In case you don’t get the writing on the wall, Atlas is being set up as the most perfect perfection that ever perfected. He’s also the way to getting the “raised in an abusive household” plotline uncovered. Like in all NA stories, Atlas and Lily are torn apart. Lily moves on with her life, graduates college, yada yada, and, as mentioned above, meet-cutessuper creeperMr. Right 2.0 on the roof. Mr. Right 2.0 is not only another most perfect perfection that ever perfected, but he’s alsorichand aneurosurgeonand very obviously husband material even though he’s never had a girlfriend (also after dating only six months),annnnnnnnddue to their mutually busy schedules not really knowing the guy.It wasn’t too hard to see where the story was going to go (and no, I hadn’t been spoiled because I didn’t read any reviews or the synopsis, I just auto-request everything by Hoover from both NetGalley and the library). Basically this was a story about domestic abuse and making excuses not only the first time he knocks your ass down “on accident” but also the second time when you wake up after “falling” down the stairs and hearing his sob story about a superbadawful that effed him up as a kid and then agreeing on a policy where“When you’re upset, just walk away. And I’ll walk away”(becauseTHAT’Sgoing to fucking work) and then saying“It’s okay, Ryle. It’s okay. You were angry, it’s okay”and making sure even when you’re bleeding profusely out of your fucking skull and are concussed and have quite possibly just been raped by your own damn husband that you get taken to an emergency room in a hospital other than the one where your bastard abuser works in order to protect his ass as well as explaining“sometimes the reason women go back is simply because they’re in love”and in case all that wasn’t e-fucking-nough you add in a whoopsie baby (another NA per usual) to serve as the wake-up call that maybe it’d be a good idea to ditch this zero and eventually find you a hero,buuuuuuuuuuuutyou just come to an agreement regarding visitation and whathaveyou rather than involving the court and much needed supervised interaction because youknowhe wouldn’t hurt the baby since it’s obvious he loves her . . . .Nope.I’m well aware I’m going against the grain here.

Reading this book will change your life. It’s so different from any of Colleen Hoover’s other books. You can tell it’s heavier, more personal, just more. This book is deep. It’s profound. It’s a book that needs to be read. I'll repeat:THIS IS A BOOK THAT NEEDS TO BE READ!This story is moving. It will make you think about things that are uncomfortable to think about. It will lift your heart, devastate you at times, make you proud, fill you with sorrow and make you smile. It will move you. It’s powerful and intense in the best way, but also has hopeful and lighter moments. The story itself is one that has been heavy on my heart from the moment I finished it.Sometimes, I read a book and it’s so beautiful, influential and emotional I will cry just thinking about the characters and their story. Not in a bad way necessarily, I just get that moved and that emotional while thinking about it. That is this book. Trying to find the words for this review is bringing me to tears. It’s hard to explain the story completely spoiler free, but this isn’t a ‘sad’ book. It’s a strength book. Because dealing with the issues in this story took so much strength.I’m not going to talk about the actual story at all, but I will speak a bit about the characters.Lily. Speaking of strength, Lily may be the strongest heroine that I’ve read about. Your strength is really tested when you are put in a hard situation where your choices are impossible. I loved Lily so much. I was proud of Lily and the choices she made. I want to be Lily when I grow up.Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we’ll never get back.There are two men in this story, but please don’t think this is a triangle book. It’s not. It’s hard to explain, but it’s not.Ryleis a charming guy. He’s a giving person. He’s got a lot of great attributes. I’m not sure if I’ve ever felt so conflicted over a character as I did him.Atlasis the type of man I always have a soft spot for as a reader. His story gutted me at times, but he is also a character with a lot of strength and so much beauty. I loved Atlas from the second I met him and that love never stopped throughout the book.“Lily?” he whispers, looking at me sincerely. “You just might be the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”Aside from the three main characters in the story, Lily’s mom played a prominent part. Their relationship played an even bigger part. Ryle’s sister and Lily’s best friend Alyssa was one of my favorite characters in this book. When things got hard she was there. One line she said in the book, to Lily just solidified the type of woman she was. Coleen always writes that one side character that you love so hard in her stories, and Alyssa was that character for me. I can’t not mention Ellen, because, well, it’s Ellen. That part was brilliant. It made me smile every time Ellen was mentioned.When reading this book, there were moments I struggled between not being able to tear my eyes away from the page, and others I had to take a breather because I couldn't handle what was going on.Parts of this story left me so heartbroken and others lifted me up so high. There are some parts that are just so powerful I could only read them in awe. This is it. This is why I read. Books like this.All humans make mistakes. What determines a person’s character aren’t the mistakes we make. It’s how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses.Colleen Hoover is an author who truly has a way with words. She killed this book. I’ve read and loved all of CoHo’s books. Some of her earlier books are some of my all-time favorites. I’ve enjoyed all of her latest books, but this is by far the best book she’s ever written. And it’s tied withHopelessas my own personal favorite book by her. And that is saying a lot, becauseHopelessis one of my top books ever.If you only read one book this year, let it beIt Ends with Us. Everyone needs to read this book. 5+ star favorite. Completely unforgettable and highly recommended!“It stops here. With me and you. It ends with us.”""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I honestly don't know how I feel.There are times I amangryand times I amsad. And then I'm both.

We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.”I did my best not to cry. I felt sick, but I clenched my jaw and forced myself to keep reading, trying in vain to ignore the tremors that ran through my body. But when the last chapters came, and Colleen's note in the end, I couldn't take it any more. I dissolved into angry, hot tears, and I checked my chest to make sure my heart was not bleeding. Lily's story had a lot to teach. I think I died a little when I realized that sometimeslove is not enough. Regret, good will, they're not enough to fix some wounds. On the contrary, they make them deeper.“Just because someone hurts you doesn't mean you can simply stop loving them. It's not a person's actions that hurt the most. It's the love. If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear.”It Ends with Usis the most personal and daring and painful bookColleen Hooverhas ever written. Abuseanddomestic violenceare a delicate subject, and when I found out they were this book's main theme I thought about not reading it.

In the end,I felt sorry for Ryle. For losing the love of his life, for destroying his only chance at happiness. I don't forgive him, I just wish that a magic wand would make everything better.“So much gravity, pushing down on my emotions. Everything shatters.My tears, my heart, my laughter, my soul. Shattered like broken glass, raining down around me.”Lily is a hero.She haddignity, andcourageandstrength. At first I was judging her mother for staying, but witnessing through Lily's eyes her challenges, feeling her heartbreak and her dilemmas, made me regret all the ugly things I thought. Loving the person who hurts you is a greater torture than the physical act itself. And damn it I loved Ryle, and I hated Colleen for that.I hated her for making me swoon and laugh when she was about to shatter my soul.The Katerina that startedIt Ends with Usis a different person than the Katerina that finished it.

When I re-read this in prep for the new one and then diving right in to it, I feel the need to change this rating to a 2. However, I will be leaving my original review up.It Ends With Us... Wow I really don\'t know what to truly say about this novel. This review will be a little light because, like most CoHo books, you\'ll want to go into it with little to no information. I went into this book thinking it was going to be this one thing, and it turned out to be the complete opposite.IEWUfollows Lily, a girl in her early twenties, who has never had it easy. Though coming from a family that was better off she has always had to work for the things she\'s wanted. After graduating college she gets up and moves to Boston and hopes to start her own business. While there she meets and falls for Ryle, a thriving neurosurgeon who is determined to be the best in his field. The two hit it off hard, and things seem almost too good to be true. Ryle is everything that Lily is not. He is forward, assertive, and stubborn. He is also a lot of thing Lily is; he is strong, passionate, and motivated. Though the two have an immediate connections and sparks fly, the two decided to take their time getting to know one another. Lily is such a beautifully written leading lady. I loved getting to grow with her and be apart of her journey. I loved hearing her thoughts and seeing how she processed things. When I was first reading and got to the point where she does her journal entries, but she does them so they are letters to Ellen DeGeneres, I thought I wasn\'t going to like that aspect of it. The first few had me thinking ""this is a little cheesy"", but the more I got into it the more I started to enjoy them. They really tied Lily\'s past and present perfectly together. As Lily\'s and Ryle\'s relationship pushes forward she finds herself looking back at those entries and thoughts of her first love Atlas resurface. Atlas was her first everything and was the biggest impact on her life. Atlas was the homeless boy who found his way into the abandoned house next door. Atlas and Lily as teens formed an unlikely friendship. Sharing everything and having a bond that no one around them seemed to understand. Spending every possible moment together and having so many stolen ones the two were kindred spirits. When Atlas reappears in the story it truly threatens everything Lily and Ryle have. (not a spoiler it\'s given he eventually will). Both Ryle and Atlas bring such important and different aspects to this story. I think CoHo manages to make them both such polar opposites, but at the same time manages to make them mesh so well.The characters in the book, main or side, all feel so realistic and authentic.When it comes to the plot there is almost nothing I can say about it. I hope everyone will do the same to keep things from getting spoiled. The story is an emotional roller coaster from start to finish. It\'s one of those books that you will have a thousand theories about and all of them will be wrong. I kept trying to guess what I thought might happen next and in classic Hoover style she managed to surprise me. This book was solid from page one and was steady throughout, but around the 80% mark is where things really took a turn (in the best way possible).IEWUhit me on such a personal level. I didn\'t expect this book to impact me so hard. It had everything I wanted from a New Adult read. It\'s very classic CoHo, but it also branches out somewhere she\'s never been before, but she does it with such ease. She manages to weave these heavy moments with ones that will make you swoon, laugh, and then cry. My favorite part of this book though, was the author\'s note. Usually author\'s notes are at the beginning of the story, however it is so important that this one was left for the end. It took a book that was good and made it exceptional! God, this note effected me like so few books have. It made me cry fifty times harder than the entire book or anything Colleen\'s ever written.Finding out how important this book was for her to write will hit you hard, but I hope she also knows how important it is as a reader to read. Knowing where an author gets their ideas from can change your whole outlook on a book, and this one... this one broke me.Thank you Colleen Hoover for continuing to gift the reading community with your words.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Dear Colleen,I find it fitting that I write this review as a letter to you the way Lily would write to Ellen. Don\'t ask me why, I really don\'t know. What I do know is that I haven\'t been on Goodreads in nearly six months and it\'s entirely your fault that i\'m here now. So, if i stumble upon a poor review on one of my books and end up in the fetal position on my kitchen floor surrounded by Ding Dong wrappers, well, I\'m blaming it on you. I\'ve even given my husband instructions to bill you for the psychiatry bill if that happens.On Friday I had a hysterectomy. It wasn\'t the worst day of my life, but it certainly wasn\'t the best. One chapter of my life--quite possibly the best chapter--ended. The surgery itself took twenty minutes. Twenty minutes. Can you believe that? Twenty minutes to take out the uterus that carried my three beautiful babies for a total of twenty eight months. Twenty minutes to change my life. Don\'t feel bad for me, that\'s not what I want. The offending organ had to come out, I knew this. But it didn\'t make it any easier. It didn\'t make the finality of the situation any easier. In all honesty, for a couple of minutes I didn\'t just feel like a chapter was ending, more like an entire flipping book. Maybe my life isn\'t made up of chapters, maybe it\'s part of a duet, or a trilogy? Either way, part of my story was over.Over a matter of several hours, I slowly woke up from surgery and at one point I remember sitting there and just staring at the wall paper in my hospital room.My uterus was gone.Mauve diamonds.The wallpaper was covered in mauve diamonds.That\'s the most hideous color, don\'t you think? Mauve. Not quite pink. Not quite maroon.I counted seven hundred and fifty three diamonds before I allowed the first tear to fall. But I wasn\'t just crying for losing a part of my body, and I wasn\'t crying for losing the ability to carry more children. I was crying because some women don\'t even get to experience what I\'ve gotten to experience. Some women never get to have babies. They never get to feel them grow in their bellies. They never get to see the slimy little monsters as they tumble their way into this world.And I did.I got to do all of that three times.So why was I so upset? What the hell was my problem? I should be grateful, right? Happy?My husband slept soundly in the chair, snoring softly, but at some point my cries must have woken him up. He stirred and I did the only thing I could do ... I grabbed your book. You see, it was sitting on my bedside table. I buried my nose between the pages and when my better half asked me if I was okay I simply peeked over the top of the book and whispered, ""Colleen. She did it again.""I didn\'t need to say much more, he knows my obsession with your words and I found myself grateful. Grateful that he knew your books make me cry and grateful that you inadvertently allowed me to grieve. And that\'s what I did. I read your book and I grieved. I cried when Lily cried. I cried when Ryle cried. And even when no one was crying, I still cried simply because I needed to and I could and no one thought twice about it because i was reading and that\'s what i do when i read. It was my outlet, my excuse for the tears that wouldn\'t go away, the tears that kept falling despite my desperate protest.I cried for all of the Lily\'s in the world, and the Ryle\'s too. I cried for the Atlas\'. And I cried for the Kirby\'s (that\'s my name. No i\'m not named after a vacuum, or a cream puff)But you see, I didn\'t want to cry. I didn\'t want to be upset. I have three beautiful children whom I love with my entire heart. My body did it\'s job extremely well and that is something to be proud of. But why wasn\'t I proud?Naked truth?I\'m selfish.I wanted one more baby even though my husband didn\'t. I wanted one more baby when there are women out there that can\'t have any at all.So why am I telling you this? My story is nothing like Lily\'s. Not even close.But maybe it is ...She wanted something she shouldn\'t want. I wanted something I couldn\'t have. She had a decision to make ... one that would change her life. So did I. She made a decision that was right for her and for her life at that particular time.Ditto.But the real reason I\'m telling you this is because for two days I was drowning and It Ends With Us was my lifeline. It\'s what I grabbed when I needed to stop thinking ... it\'s what I grabbed when i needed to cry ... and when i finally finished the book and put it down, it wasn\'t mauve diamonds that I saw ... it was my smiling children.My three beautiful smiling children ... and my niece Lily.-- Kirby'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '""We all have a limit. What we\'re willing to put up with before we break.""When was the last time a book just completely slayed me, cutting me so deep and evoking such strong emotions? It feels like my heart has been filled, then broken, filled, then broken. In the end, I\'m stunned by what I read.It Ends with Usstarts out innocently enough. We follow the courtship of Lily and Ryle. He is handsome, successful, and so thoroughly smitten with Lily he can barely think. He makes advances while claiming he doesn\'t do relationships. She rebuffs him while secretly pining for him. Really, it\'s all fun and a bit frivolous, your standard romance.But then we arrive at the crux of this story, which I\'ll try my best to be vague here so as to minimize the spoilage. (Though at this point, with all the hubbub surrounding the movie, I\'d be surprised if there is anyone out there who doesn\'t yet know what this is about.) Nonetheless, it\'s best to read it from Colleen Hoover\'s own words, and what an astounding set of words they are.Make no mistake, this isn\'t a romance even though it starts out as one. Instead, it\'s a considerably more honest look at relationships—their ups and downs, and what really happens when the rosy tint wears off and it turns out one person has bigger issues than the relationship can contain. As a result, it asks us readers the very uncomfortable question of just how much we are willing to put up with for love.I will say, the main topic in here is something that a lot of books try to tackle, but very few do right. Often books will go heavy-handed in making one character out to be the villain, as if afraid that a more subtle approach will somehow be misconstrued as condonement. But this does a disservice to the entire situation, making it difficult for us to understand the other character\'s perspective as well as their reasons for being in the relationship in the first place.What makes Hoover\'s portrayal so masterful is her nuanced approach. She brings a humanity to both sides that is sobering and heartbreaking, and it makes the whole thing ring true. It\'s brutal and compelling, and it\'s hard to look away.I think for those of us fortunate enough to never have been in a situation like this, it\'s easy to take the ideal road and turn our noses up at anything less than the puritanical view. But real life isn\'t like that at all; it isn\'t black and white. It\'s filled to the brim with all sorts of gray, day in and day out. And Hoover shades in the gray with a skillfulness that is so raw and visceral, it often made me forget where my lines are.Many people think that Hoover is romanticizing what is going on in here, but that isn\'t it at all. In making Ryle the complex person that he is with good qualities, and in making Ryle and Lily\'s relationship happy most of the time, Hoover actually manages to explain the most confounding paradox of abusive relationships—that they are good or even great most of the time, and that the victim is neither too dumb to realize they\'re being mistreated nor are they too lazy to affect change. But rather, the victim needs to be exceptionally strong and well-supported in order to leave behind so many good moments in order to cut out a few bad ones.I read this book years ago when it first came out, and I remember thinking highly of it, though not much else. So when I read it again this time, I admit I was shaken by how hard it hit me. I think it\'s because I\'m older now and have more experience with love and relationships, so I\'m able to appreciate this story even more.My suggestions if you\'re going to read this book—have a box of tissues ready and don\'t skip the author\'s note at the end. I sobbed my way to the finishing line, then read the author\'s note and sobbed some more. This is a riveting and worthwhile read, though at times difficult, and it showcases Colleen Hoover at her best, taking her contemporary new adult genre and elevating it to soaring heights.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:It Starts with UsVerityReminders of HimRegretting YouUgly LoveLayla~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Preventing your heart from forgiving someone you love is actually a hell of a lot harder than simply forgiving them.4 1/2 stars.Holy crap, what a book.This is unlike anything Hoover has written before. I have so many emotions right now that it\'s hard to know where to start, but I think everyone should read this book. That\'s right: everyone.I could easily give everything away. I could, but I won\'t. If you go looking for lots of reviews, it won\'t be hard to work out whatIt Ends with Usis about. And if you do, you should still read it, but I think it\'s better if you don\'t. I think you should go into this book knowing as little as possible. Just realize that this is something very different from Hoover\'s usual new adult romances (that I admittedly have hadallkindsofproblemswith).So I don\'t want to say too much, but this is anextremely powerful storyand it\'s not what most people will be expecting. It gets its power from the singular first person narrative (I\'m honestly not a big fan of the alternating male/female POV romances) and we experience everything through Lily\'s eyes. When she falls in love, we fall in love; when her heart is broken, our heart is broken; when she gets it all wrong, so do we.I cannot stress how important anddamn smartthis book is. There is no black and white characterization - it\'s much deeper and more complex than that, and therefore, far more emotional.It peels back the layers of characters and relationships to do something that so many other authors have tried and failed to do - to make you understand a situation that for most people makes no sense. It\'svery sad, painful and exceptionally honest. My heart hurt while reading it and I almost cried several times.As well as all this emotion and sadness that I\'m being coy about, Hoover also brings out some of her very best writing. Little gems of honesty about human nature and relationships that are all the more painful because of their resounding truth. It\'s such a quotable book, but unfortunately most of the quotes are spoilers, so I shall refrain from posting them.There\'s so many great things to mention, but I keep getting distracted by myfeelings. The narrative is interspersed with letters that Lily wrote as a teenager and they are addressed to Ellen Degeneres - a strange touch that ends up being absolutely perfect. Shit, just writing this review and remembering the story is an emotional experience.And then there\'s theabsolutely fantastic female friendship. I want Allysa to be my best friend. Hoover clearly knows her audience of 16-25 year old women, creating characters with their quirks and habits - Allysa, for example, is a self-confessed ""Pinterest whore"", which made me laugh. But seriously, she is the best friend ever and she says one of the most perfect lines in this book.Anyway, I\'m just going to start rambling soon because I read this book in a whirlwind of emotions throughout a single day. I\'ve been up since a ridiculous time and I need to go sleep now. But really, give this book a chance. I thought it was excellent.Trigger Warnings:Domestic abuse (physical, occasionally graphic).

I promise.""I\'m convinced anyone who gives this five stars is not sane. It contains the typical ~ I don\'t do marriage~ love interest, but somehow, he magically wants a committed relationship and kids with our lucky lady after a few interactions. We love being the only exception. It ends with us contains a lot of dark elements such as abuse, toxic relationships, and attempted rape. I understand this novel is based on the author\'s experience, but that doesn\'t mean it\'s good, nor am I obligated to like it. There\'s absolutely no justification for abuse, and why Lily continues to stay is beyond my comprehension. Throwing away your morals just because someone is hot has got to be the stupidest thing ever.The author added numerous poor book decisions; I\'ll list some of them here:1) The main character\'s full name is Lily Blossom Bloom, and she runs a florist shop. Do I need to say more?2) Lily is obsessed with Ellen Degeneres to the point where Ellen becomes the 4th main character of the story.3) Ryle knocked on 29 apartment doors simply to find Lily and proceeded to beg on his knees for her to fuck him.4) Lily\'s bedroom light turned on at the exact perfect moment, just as Atlas was about to commit suicide. Wow, what a mere coincidence. He thought she was an angel beaming in the light. He said, and I quote""I ~felt~ something,""that\'s the reason why he didn\'t want to kill himself anymore.5) Every repetitive""just keep swimming""reference.6) Ryle put a big picture of Lily on his wall after their first meeting.

It\'s difficult to leave someone you love in such situations, which are never black and white. It is so hard that you come up with excuses and can even make the truth sound like made-up lies. I previously stated that I couldn\'t understand why Lily never left Ryle after the first incident of assault happened. It contradicts what I said just now about the author\'s message, but that\'s because I\'ve never understood their chemistry. Lily said she couldn\'t leave because she loved him too much, which was strange. It was merely a case of physical attraction. There\'s also no reason for the author to randomly throw a bunch of serious topics (homelessness, guilt, infertility, abuse, suicidal thoughts) just for the sake of making the book forcefully emotional and not going more in-depth about them. Furthermore, I was not too fond of the plot and didn\'t connect with a single character. I don\'t understand why Ryle didn\'t get help, especially when he could do things similar to their daughter or another partner. That man better stay the hell away from me, or I will seal him up in a trash bag and hit him to the moon with a baseball bat. In conclusion, I will never touch another Colleen Hoover book.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'My additional thoughts on the book adaptation and my movie review:I love Colleen Hoover so much, I’d probably even read her shopping list if she published it—her perfect blend of angst and tear-jerking emotion always gets me! I also really enjoyed the movie—the performances were strong, the emotional depth was moving, and the powerful, liberating message against domestic violence truly resonated with me.However, I can’t stand the ongoing feud between the lead actors. It needs to end! They need to make peace, especially with the It Starts with Us sequel coming up. It’s time to put the drama behind them and focus on what’s next for the fans.Here are my thoughts on the movie:https://medium.com/@niluferyozmekik/i...———————-Oh my! Argh! This is me confronting my ripped apart heart pieces after reading this book! Actually, I read the book a long time ago. I was too scared to write a review because writing meant opening up about my feelings. This book hurt me a lot, and I couldn’t find the right words to describe the “hurt” it gave me.Honestly, this is my longest Coelho reading because I put it down several times. I got pissed! I screamed! I clenched my fists so hard! I cursed the entire family tree of Ryle Kinkaid! I haven’t wanted to hire contract torturers to kidnap a character and give them the punishment they deserved for so long.The things he did to Lily—the physical and emotional abuse—were impossible for me to absorb. I felt breathless and gave up several times. This book sledgehammered my heart and crushed my soul!I returned to my reading because the beautiful love story between Atlas and Lily was like seeing sunshine through dark clouds, giving me the only hope I could hold onto. I honestly thought of only reading the flashbacks to warm my heart!What if they had reconnected that night when they accidentally met again at the restaurant? What if Lily had gone back to him instead of choosing a path with Ryle? That scenario made me so happy, but it would never be the same without the tremendous angst Coelho threw at us because she is an expert at bringing out the dirtiest, ugliest cries of regular human beings! And without pain and suffering, so much sadness, we don’t feel like we’re reading an actual Coelho story, do we? Never!This book is being developed into a screenplay! It’s so compelling to read this heart-stabbing, soul-sledgehammering story without consuming tons of paper products to dry the tears we may shed. I cannot imagine how the movie will affect me. But sometimes words hurt more than actions, and I’m sure no screenwriter has the ability to reflect all the emotions Coelho made us feel during our reads.So my advice: stock up on all the paper products from grocery stores, lock yourself in a soundproof room so as not to scare your neighbors with your screams and howling sounds, and give your entire concentration to this lyrical, insanely heartfelt story.It’s one of the most compelling, sad, and sensational Coelho books. I could hardly digest the emotional turmoil it gave me! But it’s worth the pain. Especially that meaningful, sentimental, poetic ending melted my heart.I made some adjustments for clarity and flow, while preserving the original emotions and tone.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'I don’t believe in disliking things just because they are popular. I went into this with the intention of liking it, but ended up feeling uncomfortable by the tone of this book. Although I wholeheartedly respect the personal nature of this story, the author’s note does not exempt this work of fiction from criticism, especially when it comes to a topic as serious as domestic abuse.I empathize with the main character Lily and I appreciate the effort that was made to highlight how trauma distorts and lingers, but I don’t believe this captured the severity or nuance that a topic this heavy deserves in fictionalized work. This book is marketed as romance, and the synopsis makes it seem like a lighthearted love triangle instead of a woman’s experience with spousal abuse. In comparison to Kate Elizabeth Russell’s harrowing depiction of abuse inMy Dark Vanessa, the tone ofIt Ends With Usfeels acutely inappropriate. It reduces domestic abuse to a lovers quarrel and presents a tactless caricature of the realities of abuse. I can acknowledge this may not have been the intention, but the elaboration in the authors note does not absolve this book of its reckless and irresponsible marketing.It Ends With Ushas the bones of a powerful story but reads like a low budget Hallmark movie pushed forward by ridiculous plot revelations. Hoover’s attempt to make Ryle into a three dimensional character completely flops. At first, I thought the accelerated relationship between Ryle and Lily was meant to emphasize how witnessing abuse in early age might make you less likely to spot red flags in others; however, it turns out Hoover was really trying to create a deep relationship between these two. Her use of “Naked Truth” to build their relationship was a lazy ploy to circumvent true development and simulated an unsatisfying and unearned intimacy. I also found the use of teenage diary entries in the form of letters to Ellen DeGeneres to have aged really badly, and comes off as a corny device to tell rather than show readers about Lily’s relationship with Atlas.The single redeeming quality of this book is the empathy that Lily develops for her mother towards the end, but this moment, as well as the ending, lacks sufficient nuance. I wanted more discussion, I wanted more development, and I wanted less telling and more showing. Although the message that the cycle of abuse “ends with us” is personal for Hoover, I feel like this depiction is reductive and makes it seem like walking away is a choice all women have. Hoover maintains that this book was meant to show that domestic abuse isn’t black and white, but I don’t think it achieved that at all. She made the conscious decision to pit romance and abuse against each other, packaged it with a pink cover, a synopsis free of any mention of abuse, and marketed it to impressionable young adults. However well intentioned this cathartic passion project was, its reception as a work of fiction is devout of nuance, the white knight message ofIt Ends With Uscompletely undercut by its blatant romanticism of abuse.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""this book sends a really important and worthwhile message, but it's not necessarily enjoyable.IT ENDS WITH US was not what i expected it to be. i started the novel knowing next to nothing about the storyline except that it's a colleen hoover book (NA romance) and that it'sgood(my friends kept raving). but if i'm being honest, i wasa little disappointed.i was hoping for a light read with lots of ~FEELZ~ but instead i got something much more intense – not bad, just unexpected.the main plot revolves around abusive and toxic relationships within families. it really opened my eyes to the emotions of those in these types of situations and helped me gain a lot of perspective. because of this, i think it's important to read this, but it's not enjoyable. it's definitely a really frustrating process to read.for the majority of this novel, i DIDN'T like it. i was definitely interested and curious, but i didn't care for the characters as much as i thought i would. i was frustrated and annoyed at the situations, and some of it felt artificial, rushed, and stereotypical. it all seemed so... fictional. usually the romance satisfies me, but even that didn't do it. buuuuuut it wasn't so much that i didn't NOT like it. it was simply okay when i expected it to be ~amazing~.there were two romantic tropes that bothered me because i don't like the tropes themselves and because i didn't think it was executed THAT well: insta-love and love triangle.ryle was too good to be true; a hot, young, smart, compassionate, arrogant, sensitive, rich guy suddenly appears and falls head over heels for our main character. they – somehow!! – meet again and this time he's literally BEGGING to have sex with her. suddenly, this fuckboi wants to be in a committed relationship and plans on having kids with our lucky lady. um......... okay????? i didn't feel anything for their relationship and ryle seemed like a plot device to me. and when she didn't leave him the first time, i knew i KNEW he would do much worse again. and i didn't feel surprised when it happened; i didn't feel surprised when she asked for the divorce – a little relieved maybe, but not surprised.then there's atlas, who i felt had more depth than ryle and lily but also not thaaaat much. he was probably my favorite character, but i felt his story (the letters) were kinda.. anti-climactic? their relationship was confusing to decipher, but i still loved them. it made me sad to think lily didn't end up with atlas IN THE FIRST PLACE but i guess that would make the whole purpose of the book redundant.even though i didn't enjoy the process of reading this book, i'm grateful to have read it. there are some books you read for pleasure and there are some you read to gain knowledge and perspective. this is the latter.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Phenomenal!This book will make you fall in love, rip your heart out and force you to reconsider your preconceived ideas about abuse. This is the most moving book that I've read in a LONG time. It was absolutely addicting, but so difficult at times. I don't cry very often, but this one had me crying big, fat tears.It's been a couple of days since I finished 'It Ends With Us' and I'm still thinking about Lily's story. It's one that'll hang with you. In so many ways, her story gutted me. Yet, it was also inspiring.Lily grows up in an abusive household. After watching her mother suffer for years at the hand of her father, she tells herself that she'll never allow any man to treat her that way. She grows into a strong and independent woman, leaving behind the horrors of her childhood...Or so she thinks.Despite everything she's promised herself, Lily finds herself in an abusive relationship. The behavior and cycle is so insidious that you almost can't believe what is happening. Ms. Hoover manages to weave the violence into a relationship that is otherwise seemingly perfect. It is so skillfully written that you won't want to believe what you've read.I found myself making excuses for the abuser. I didn't want to believe that he wouldn't change. For the first time, I could understand why women make excuses for abusers. I can only imagine how strong that pull must be in reality if I felt so strongly about a fictional character.I am in awe of Lily. Her strength and conviction blew me away.

Im afraid it was not (imo) I just feel like this could have been 200-300 pages shorter?? because this book followed a repetitive nature, it had no reason being like that except for its page count. See, with book 1 you at least were engrossed in the story because you wanted to know what would happen but I didnt really have that feeling when it came to this book. The same dialogues were being thrown around, Johnny was more about Shannon and his whole athletic part went away until the last parts. Shannon's story dragged as it went on as well, like the start was so good and by start I mean the first 250 pages and last 150-200 pages were really good as well but that middle?? sucked so fucking bad. I am still giving it a higher rating because I enjoyed most of this book especially the start with how things picked up right where they left off in b13 and in the end when shit went down but, for a second book for Shannon and Johnny....they felt pretty dull.Shannon and Johnnyin terms of them as individual characters, I wanted more development on Shannon's part because tbh all the she did was talk back to her mother and Darren, and in a way I think this does contribute to character development because at least she was doing something but I wanted more. To sum it up she talks back (ok good for her) thinks about Johnny and whenever she's around him it's sex, sex and sex although I would admit how well her emotions were described and how the ptsd was shown through her point of view, I just wanted more of her overcoming it and one thing I specifically wanted was the confrontation with Bella which we did got but it was so diluted like actually so diluted smh atp. Johnny im a little conflicted because there were parts that I enjoyed so much and others were so disappointing, the disappointing one would be hi being consumed by the thoughts of Shannon like Shannon this and Shannon that and I love down bad MMC's but 900 pages is too much. I loved how Johnny treated Shannon's siblings, I loved their scenes so much and I liked how muchh cared for Shannon but I really wanted him to focus on his game as well. It was conflicting but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Them together were cute and I did understand the smut scenes like come on we literally spent a whole 800 paged book with slow burn seeping off it and even here it didnt really happen until 350 pages through but I liked their moments together. They were cute<33The side characters are who took the spotlight!! Claire, Lizzie, Gibsie, Hughie, Feely, Joey and Aoife, Mama Kavs and Papa Kavs. I love them sm. I actually ship Hughie and Katie and Lizzie with Feely so there better not be a cheating switch tropes or im literally gonna riot. I like Lizzie and I want her story. Gibsie and Claire I cant wait for their book because I love them, ESPECIALLY GIBSIE! I want Joeys books so bad and I know his story will have me sobbing. Also I loved Joeys Mam and Da sm they are actually so precious with everything that they did!!! also that Aoife and Joey vs Bella and Cormac scene!! It healed me.Overall, considering the hype and the avg rating, I was expecting something mind-blowing which I didnt get but I enjoyed it so much!__I just know this one will hit so hard, considering how things ended in the first one (or its justHodapraying that I cry because she's hell bent on making me cry >:( )""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'WOW. just wow. ❤️\u200d🩹'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Having THE BEST TIME with this series. Imo this one was not as good as the first one but it was much more emotional comparatively. I absolutely flew through this mammoth of a book and had such a great time. Am in love with Shannon and Johnny's story and their innocent, sweet, precious love.As the two main characters struggle with their traumas and pain, the love they find amongst each other is so pure and keeps them grounded and sane. I loved how they had such a strong support system around themselves. Their love is worth fighting for. I loved how the two battled their fights and gave unconditional support to each other. Reading this book, I realized that although I like Shannon, it's Johnny who is the stronghold and life of this book.🩷Shannonis a vulnerable teenager who has been bullied since she was a tiny kid tbh and for her to constantly seek reassurance makes perfect sense to me. But what did get to me in the middle of the book was how repetitive her quirks got, I wish that could've been better written or filtered out making room for more growth in her character arc.🏉Johnnyis the life of this book. He has such a big heart and he genuinely puts in effort, shows support and unconditional love towards everyone he cares about. I love those traits. I love how he was never shy of reassuring Shannon even though she asked him the same questions 100 times in a day. For him? It's all about what he can do to make her and her siblings feel safe and loved.Coming to theside characters,my heart breaks for almost all of them but I found the one I love the most in this series-Joey Lynch.I love the man he is. I love him and his broken parts, his big heart, protective self, his selflessness, and his being. He is a character that deserves the world the most and all the happiness. I can't wait to read his books. I really likeAoife,she is Joey's stability and all things good. The punch she landed on Bella was badass.Gibsie and Clairehave always been great to me. Their chemistry is chef's kiss. I don't likeLizzieat all so far. I love Shannon's cute sibling brothers and appreciate the Kavanagh family to bits.The only issue I had here was that some of the conversations were too repetitive.I didn't really care for it much in Binding 13 but in this one it was a bit too much for me to handle.The last 200 pages were wild. I never saw them come and it made me cry so much.The endingwas perfect. It felt real and things wrapped up pretty well for all. I can't wait to find out what lies ahead for Joey but am mentally not prepared to read that yet. I just know my heart will be going through it so going to take a short break before that.~•~•~I MUST read this right now after that ending in Binding 13 😭😭""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""“For keeps?” I breathed.He kissed my shoulder. “For keeps.”Did I finish this book or did it finish me?Heartbreaking, soul-crushing, profound but above all an unforgettable and a beautiful story. I expected this book to be full of sunshine and happiness, but it was so much intense, emotional and heartbreaking than B13. There were so many dark and heavy topics in this book and Chloe didn't hesitated to show us the raw, realistic and blatant vulnerability in this book. But above everything else, this book has one of the best, beautiful and genuine found family.The romance was tender, charming, adorably awkward sweet. K13 focused more on the family dynamics, characters' growth and development, trauma and healing of the Lynch siblings. Chloe delved deeper into Lynch's family dynamics, showed us the pain and darkness that lurked inside their house, showed us that not everything in reality is always black and white, and that sometimes freedom, forgiveness and happiness costs life and death. I can't even imagine the pain the Lynch siblings has suffered for the years and its incomprehensible until you step into their shoes and Chloe reflected their pain, trauma and unhappiness in this book and let me tell you it was gut-wrenching and heartbreaking in the worst way possible.“Well, I don’t want easy. I want you. Just the way you are. Every part and every piece.”“Even the broken parts?”He winked. “Especially the broken parts.”➸ Shannon LynchI really liked how Shannon tried to come out of her shell in this book. It was a small growth on her part but I don't expect her to do a one-eighty in just a few months because Shannon has been through hell in her entire life. She is finally trying to let other people in her life and I liked how she's not lying to anyone even when it goes against her surviving nature. She stood up for herself against her family and her bullies when it was needed. She's so precious and strong and resilient and maybe she doesn't know it yet but she is a survivor through and through who did everything in her power to climbed back up on her feet.“I’m here for Johnny the boy. Not Johnny the rugby player. I’ll stay for both, but I’m only in love with one.”➸ Johnny Kavanagh The BulldozerJohnny Kavanagh the gentleman you are 🤌🏻💘 It still surprises me that he's just eighteen-years-old, but the way this man treats everyone in his life is admirable. His unconditional support and love for the people he loves. The things he says and the things he do melts my heart every time. Johnny is a protector (and a bulldozer) and it goes against his nature if he can't help someone he loves and Johnny played a huge role in giving Lynch siblings the life they deserved. His ambitions and passion for Rugby makes him even more attractive and I love me a man who knows his worth. Johnny may seem like a perfect golden boy on the outside but he had his own insecurities and fears about life and he is doing his absolutely best to sought them out and with Shannon by his side, he feels more like himself when she is with him.“That from the very first day you walked into my life, you changed me. That very first time I saw you? You sparked to life something inside of me.”╰┈➤ Johnny and Shannon“You smell like home.”“You are home.”I loved the awkwardness between Johnny and Shannon whenever they were together, winging their way through their newly formed relationship, figuring out the physical attraction and love they have for each other. It was so pure, innocent, adorable and genuine and it was the actual representation of how teenage love feels like. I loved how they just couldn't get enough of each other and were always trying to be with each other and I hated every moment when someone cock blocked them and it happened so many times. Felt bad for Johnny and his Johnnies.“I like you because you’re you, Shannon. I’ve never met another girl like you. I mean a girl as kind, and caring, and trustworthy, and loyal as you. And beautiful. Jesus Christ, you are so fucking beautiful that it’s painful to look at you. I’ve never seen anything like you in my life.”Johnny and Shannon are the definition of “true love”.The way these two love and protect each other is everything. They are so ridiculously and irrevocably in love with each other that it's insane sometimes because they are just teenagers but I still want what they have. The tenderness and care they showed each other through their actions, patience, words, touches, and love confessions is everything. How Johnny always made sure she was safe and fought for her family and how Shannon was always there for him to support his career and his passion for Rugby even though she was affraid of letting him go was everything. I loved how they let go of their armor to let the other person see the emotional scars and vulnerabilities they hid from the world. Two people loving each other for simply who they are in reality, bringing changes and happiness in each other's life, supporting each other, making compromises and sacrifices to be together is the truest form of love and Johnny and Shannon understood that assignment.“You make me feel like I’m enough as I am,”“You are enough,” I breathed, wrapping my hand around his neck. “Just as you are right now.”➸ Joey and AoifeI loveJoeyso much and it hurts to see him like this. He was tossed into a role he didn't wanted to play. He was the father, mother, brother and the only person that brought balance and happiness in his siblings' life. He fed them, loved them, protected them. He is so selfless, always doing right by his siblings but nobody cared to do right by his side. Nobody cares for his feelings and his pain and it broke my heart because this boy deserves all the love and happiness in the world. I love howAoifeloves Joey and keeps him grounded. She was so badass when she fought Bella.Aoife and Joeyhad so many emotional and heartbreaking moments and honestly, I am not ready for their story because I know it's gonna ruin me in the best possible ways.“You’re in there, aren’t you? Hmm?” She pressed a kiss to the corner of his mouth. “I see you, Joey Lynch.” She stroked her nose against his and whispered, “You can’t hide from me.”➸ Gibsie and ClaireGibsie is my precious boy.He always brings the joy and happiness with his funny and entertaining personality but behind all that lies a very vulnerable person who wants to hide all his pain with humour and laughs. Him going all mama bear for Claire was so cute.Claire is our sunshine girl.She's the best bestfriend in their group. I love how she understands Gibsie so well, always humour his weird and funny thoughts.“You keep that head up,” he ordered, tipping her chin with his thumb. “Don’t you dare hide that angel face from the world.”➸ Mammy K and Daddy Kav are the best parents in the world.Their love, support and care helped Lynch siblings a lot and I love how they didn't hesitated once to took all of them under their roof, nourished them, fed them, loved them. I want them to adopt me too 😭🙏🏼 I'll be a good sister, I promise.➸ Lynch siblings:I love Tadgh's little bitch personality and his banter with Gibsie was so good. He's the only person who gets on his nerves lol. Ollie was such a cutie and Sean was the cutest kid. I love how he bonded with Johnny and how Johnny was so obsessed with Sean. Their small moments of happiness made my day.“I want all of you to stay with my family.”“But we’re a lot of trouble,” she whispered.“I like your trouble. I want your trouble and your complications and everything else that comes with you.” Leaning closer, I stroked my nose against hers. “I want you.”➸ Lizzie:I hated her in this book. She had no right to hurt Gibsie and then later on justify it with her trauma and pain.I hated how Darren was meddling in Lynch family's business and completely ignored Joey. I did felt bad for him and it made completely sense why he left his siblings behind but it was selfish.The scene where it all went downhill and the Lynch siblings were grieving the loss of their mother were heartbreaking. As a woman, I have so much sympathy for Shannon's mother, Marie. I hate her for not standing up for her children but I also understand her fears because when Darren said,“All she had in the whole fucking world was him. She was a baby having babies and it broke her!”, my heart broke for Marie. She didn't deserved that ending but atleast she chose her children and did the right thing for them in the end.The endingwas bittersweet but I was satisfied with the decisions Johnny and Shannon made and I am so ready to see more of them in next books!I hate Chloe for giving me swollen and puffy eyes but but atleast I found another fictional found family ❤️\u200d🩹 I did not expected to have this many crying sessions while reading this book but everything was worth it for Johnny and Shannon. I am never saying goodbye to this series and these characters because I will be reading this series for the rest of my life and that's how much I love them.“When it comes to you, Shannon Lynch, I’m all in.”“Me too.”“Where you go, I go.”“Promise?”“I promise.”——————Pre-read review:I missed my precious pookies so here we are 😌💗 finally found the courage after 3 months to continue this series""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '☆⋅⋆ ──1st read 2020: 5 stars☆⋅⋆ ───2nd read 2023:5+ stars""I love you,"" she whispered, fingers digging into my neck as she pulled my face down to hers and kissed my lips.

Be prepared for a rollercoaster of emotions.SONG RECOMMENDATION:Family Portrait - P!nkBruises - Lewis CapaldiJane - Picture ThisHurt - Christina AguileraBreath Me- SiaThe reason why this book (and series in general) deserves all these 5 stars is becauseit has HEART. It has so muchHEART, SOUL AND LOVEin it. The love is real.The most beautiful thing about The Boys of Tommen Series is, that it emphasises that love comes in many shapes and sizes.Obviously, we have the romantic love, which ofc is a big part of this series, but besides that,Binding 13andKeeping 13showcase all the different forms of love such as:the most amazing bromances, supportive female-female friendships, how strangers can become family, beautiful & heartbreaking sibling relationships, the love parents have for their children, the love the children have for their parents even though they can be quite embarrassingand more.WARNING 2:Each book in this series is long, like really long. That means a huge cast ensemble and lots of different relationships between them and I will say something to each characters & their relationship, because they are worth mentioning and the reason why this series is so great. Therefore this review is going to be a long one. (Decided to do a jointed review forBinding 13andKeeping 13)First of all, this series was addictive to read. Lately, I\'ve been having problems reading books in one sitting, but with Binding 13 and Keeping 13? No problem at all.I said fuck my life, fuck my responsibilities, fuck exam preparation, fuck it all, I\'m just going to read this series in under 48 hours and I did.As lengthy as these books appear, it doesn\'t feel long at all. I was so entranced with the story and characters that 900 pages fly by like nothing. After finishing these books, I even wished them to be longer.The reason why these books are so long is because you get a front seat to all these characters lives.Instead of telling you how these people do things, they get shown. Every milestone is shown. Every important conversation is shown. Was every scene in this book necessary? No. Would I delete anything if I could? Never.Because of how every scene was shown, I had the feeling of being right next to all these characters. All this talk about the characters, but I haven\'t told you anything about them yet. So here we go:↬𝐉𝐎𝐇𝐍𝐍𝐘 𝐊𝐀𝐕𝐀𝐍𝐀𝐆𝐇(H)OH MY GOOD!!! *SWOOON* OH MY GOD!!You\'re going to hate him, cause he just THAT perfect.Johnny is boyfriend material.He\'s every parent dream for their daughter. Smart, Gorgeous, Handsome, Future Rugby star, but most of allhe\'s KIND & GENEROUS. I\'m telling ya that\'s a lethal combination for my heart. Johnny was so sweet, I might cry because no guy in real life will ever compare to him. It\'s actually unfair, how unrealistically perfect he is 😭😭It\'s annoying how my mind can\'t come up with one single flaw. All I can say is that his mother and father have raised him right. His an overall great guy. No flaws detected.All his life, his only goal was rugby. All he focus on is training and playing rugby. A big part of the story is Johny finding himself and what he is outside of rugby. I love how from the moment he meet Shannon, he realises that he hasn\'t lived, because he was so focused on rugby. I don\'t know who his biggest fan was: Shannon, Gibsie, Mammy K or me? My money is on me. 😂↬𝐒𝐇𝐀𝐍𝐍𝐎𝐍 𝐋𝐘𝐍𝐂𝐇(h)Shannon is small, shy and extremely timid. If you look up \'damsel-in-distress\' in the dictionary, you would find Shannon\'s picture. All characteristics I don\'t look for in a heroine to be honest. My favorite heroines are more the type of \'Kick-them-in-the-balls-and-burn-them-alivekind of girls. The only thing I wished would be different is, that Shannon had more of a backbone and stand up for herself more. But the further I got in the story, the more I understood where she came from.I think it\'s so easy to judge a character by their behaviour just because you would act differently, but I know it\'s hard when you haven\'t walked in their shoes. At the beginning I was lowkey annoyed at Shannon for not telling her bullies to fuck off, but then I haven\'t been bullied and tormented my whole life in school. I don\'t have anxiety the way Shannon has anxiety, I haven\'t been mentally and physically abused by my father my whole life like Shannon. I haven\'t been separated with my family and got put into the foster system. That\'s just a fraction of terrible things that happened to Shannon. So who am I to judge how she\'s has or has not to behave?For what life has given her so far, Shannon is akind, strong & most of all resilientgirl. She endured everything as best as she could.She\'s a survivor.One of the best thing was seeing Shannon finding herself and knowing her strengths. I love the character development she went through.↬𝐉𝐎𝐇𝐍𝐍𝐘 & 𝐒𝐇𝐀𝐍𝐍𝐎𝐍URG... Johnny and Shannon were so adorable together. Their interactions are so damn awkward that it\'s sweet to watch. It\'s funny how a guy like Johnny, who has all these girls at his feet, fumbling with words and acting all awkward, because it\'s the first time that he has a crush on a girl.*sigh* Johnny treated Shannon with so much care and respect, just thinking about it makes me want to cry 🥺🥺🥺 he let her dictate the pace. He never rushed her to do anything. He was the most respectful guy ever. Did I tell you that I love him? I couldn\'t imagine a more perfect guy for Shannon. He\'s exactly what she needed.Their love was just so innocent and pure. 🤍🤍🤍↬𝐆𝐄𝐑𝐀𝐑𝐃 \'𝐆𝐈𝐁𝐒𝐈𝐄\' 𝐆𝐈𝐁𝐒𝐎𝐍(H\'s best friend)THE KING, THE MYTH, THE LEGEND, HIMSELF!!!This guy.. holy shit he is mental 🤣 I have almost every single line of Gibsie highlighted. He\'s that funny. Every time he opened his big mouth:Gibsie is hands down my favorite character in the whole series. This series has many amazing characters, but no one is on Gibsie\'s level. He\'s something else. He outshines everyone in every scene he is.The manwhore with the biggest heart.His relationship with basically every person on page was comedy gold. He\'s never serious, but when it counts, he knows exactly what to do. If someone needs his help, he is there no question asked. I\'m ready to build this man a shrine in my room. 🙌↬𝐆𝐈𝐁𝐒𝐈𝐄 & 𝐉𝐎𝐇𝐍𝐍𝐘They are the definition of platonic soulmates.Johnny and Gibsie are each other\'s RIDE OR DIE, or in their case RIDE AND DIE cause when you\'re riding with Gibsie, you\'re 100% going to die. 🤣Gibsie and Johnny\'s bromance is one of the best thing that happened to me in 2020. Their friendship is to cry for. I loved it so much. Their banter is hilarious. I don\'t know how many times I LOLed, because of these two. These two don\'t have any secrets and are constantly giving each otherunnecessarylife advises. I WAS DYING!The way they kept lift each other up during darker times. Their bromance was everything. One of the best male-male friendships in literature I\'m not lying.↬𝐂𝐋𝐀𝐈𝐑𝐄 𝐁𝐑𝐈𝐆𝐆𝐒(h\'s best friend)Claire is such a ray of sunshine. I was so happy that Shannon had Claire and Lizzie by her side who supported her all the way. Shannon never had the chance for a normal childhood, so when she transferred to the new school and had Lizzie and Claire with her that was a relief.It was good to see that Claire gave her a bit of normality. Doing girly stuff. Talking about boys. Going shopping. I love that Claire and Shannon had each other.↬𝐆𝐈𝐁𝐒𝐈𝐄 & 𝐂𝐋𝐀𝐈𝐑𝐄Gibsie and Claire are friends since childhood and clearly care for each other, but refuse to be together. I WANT THEIR BOOK NEXT AND THE FACT THAT I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL BOOK #5 IS A HATE CRIME AND PHUONG-PHOBIC 😭 Claire and Gibsie already bicker like an old married couple.Their books is the one I\'m looking forward the most. I\'m already so fucking invested in their love story, it hurts 😭 I hate the childhood best friends to lovers trope, but I already know that Claire and Gibsie are going to own that trope.↬𝐉𝐎𝐄𝐘 𝐋𝐘𝐍𝐂𝐇(h\'s older brother)My poor baby. Someone go and protect this boy who has the world\'s responsibilities on his shoulders. All he does is work, care for his good for nothing mother, protect Shannon from their father, care for the rest of the family, while dealing with the rest of his life. Somebody give this guy a gold medal and a break!Joey went through so much in this book and all I want for him is to be happy and healthy.I can\'t wait for the next book, which is Joey and Aoife\'s story. They are going to pull second-chance and accidentally pregnancy trope. Two tropes I\'m not particular fond of, but I know Chloe Walsh is going to pull it off somehow. I trust her.↬𝐒𝐇𝐀𝐍𝐍𝐎𝐍 & 𝐉𝐎𝐄𝐘The two amigos. The oldest siblings. The protectors. Shan and Joey got the worst end of the deal. Joey as the second oldest brother after their brother Darren walked out their house, had to protect all his baby siblings from his alcoholic & abusive father. Shannon as the only girl also got abused repetitively.It was them against the world.Their relationship broke my heart. Brother and sister relationships are normally not that close. When you\'re a teen, you find you\'re brother/sister annoying as hell and you constantly fight. Not these two. They are as close as how two siblings who went through hell together could be. Joey and Shannon had some really deep talk that was heart wrenching.With 16 and 18 years, you shouldn\'t be sitting in the car in front of your house crying and talking about leaving everything behind, cause reality is too hard. With 16 years, you shouldn\'t worry about your brother walking out the door and never coming back, cause the pressure of caring about your family is too much. Every time Joey and Shannon had to walk through the door to their abusive father, I just wanted to cry with them.↬𝐌𝐀𝐌𝐌𝐀 & 𝐃𝐀𝐃𝐃𝐘 𝐊𝐀𝐕𝐀𝐍𝐀𝐆𝐇Never in my life, did I have a crush on parents as hard as I have with Edel Kavanagh and John Kavanagh. I don\'t know on who I crush harder??? Mama K is a fashion designer and the most protective mama-bear. She wouldn\'t even think for a second to throw herself into a fire to save her son.She\'s a fucking badass!!When I grow up, I want to be her!! She was also extremely funny. If she wasn\'t busy embarrassing Johny infront of Shan, she was cockblocking him hardcore 😂 I love her so much.But John Kavanagh 🥵🥵🥵 I reached that age where it should be acceptable to crush on the son and the father at the same time LOL. If you read this book, you\'ll know. There is just something about successful lawyer, who are smart, kind and treat their family right that does something to me. Don\'t judge 🥵 😂 There is one scene where Daddy K is in the principal\'s office of Johnny\'s school and PLEASE the power play...↬𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐊𝐀𝐕𝐀𝐍𝐀𝐆𝐇 𝐅𝐀𝐌𝐈𝐋𝐘I WANT THE KAVANGHS TO ADOPT ME, PLEASE. I say that every couple of days and in real life it\'s not possible to get adopted that often, but you know we\'re talking about fictional families here so I don\'t see the problem. I\'m going to cry if they say no.Mother a fashion designer, Father a lawyer, Son is a popular rugby player. Smart, gorgeous & generous. How does it feel like to be god\'s favorite?I LOVE THEM I LOVE THEM I LOVE THEM.These three together are literally family goals. The way John & Edel kept supporting Johnny was nothing short but amazing.They are the best. I don\'t know better people.↬𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐋𝐘𝐍𝐂𝐇 𝐅𝐀𝐌𝐈𝐋𝐘Speaking of god. When god gave out luck, he ran out when he got to the Lynch family. It\'s sad how unlucky the Lynch siblings were.I hated their father and mother with a passion. I was so furious at the mother that she didn\'t protect her children better. Because of her they are all completely messed up. For the father I have nothing to say except that he deserves his ending.As messed up as they are, I love all the Lynch siblings so much. Joey, Shannon, Tadhg, Ollie and Sean. They are all adorable and I loved their relationship with each other. Siblings that went through hell together, stay together.𝐉𝐎𝐇𝐍𝐍𝐘 𝐀𝐍𝐃 𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐋𝐘𝐍𝐂𝐇 𝐁𝐑𝐎𝐓𝐇𝐄𝐑𝐒I\'m just trying to insert how perfect Johnny is wherever I can. To no one\'s surprise he was perfect with Shannon\'s younger brothers. Tadhg, Ollie and Sean adore him.I\'m missing so many other relationship dynamics that are worth mentioning like Gibsie + Tadhg, Johnny + his dog or all the guys in the rugby team (shoutout to Feely & Hughie), but I\'m running out of characters oops..If you made it until here, I appreciate it very much and thanks for reading, butwhat are you guys waiting for?If you can read this bad written, almost 15k review, you can also startBinding 13😂This book will not be for everyone, mostly because most people will see Shannon as weak, but everyone should at least try to experience this book.ALL THESE FEELS!!!!'}, {'rating': None, 'content': 'free palestine 🇵🇸(the author is problematic.)𓏲 . ˙ ˖ 🩷 ꒱[5 ★]i love them 🥹 my loves my soul my heart beats for them. this is one of those books you wanna savor reading as well as finish reading all in a go and then reread as soon as you finish. it was addictive as fuck. this is definitely one of those books which will stay with me forever.i’ve found my home with all these people - johnny, shannon, gibsie, claire, joey, aoife, tadhg, sean, mrs. kavanagh, mr. kavanagh, hughie, lizzie, katie and feely. i was living for joeyaoife crumbs. i laughed at every gibsieclaire crumb. i just love them so much.they’re everything. that’s all i can say. 💗'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""fuck this book, honestly. my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined 😔The beginning of this book was so good! I was literally so hooked and invested, looking forward to where Chloe Walsh was going to take us, and hoping and praying that it would be to great places so I could see what the hype was all about.Well, she definitely took us somewhere. And that was,in circles.If you ask me, I don't know her personally, but I think she lets all the intrusive thoughts in her head win and includes everything in the book except stuff that is actually necessary (read: character development, bonding moments, good dialogue). And she loves going in circles! You won't believe the number of times certain scenes are repeated in this book - truly blew my mind.I'll just mention all the positives first because there's just one: Joey Lynch. Being an older sister with a somewhat dysfunctional family, I understood him on an astronomical level. He was the only character that honestly got any kind of an emotional reaction from me. I could feel his pain, and multiple times I just wanted to get into the book and physically hug him 🥹Now the negatives. Oh boy, here we go:1. I do not appreciate it when you give me a book that's 900+ pages long, and the characters don't have any sort of development or growth: I so badly wanted to see Shannon grow as a person and come out of her shell. I wanted to see her go to counseling (no idc if she's broke, she goes to a private institution, and I bet they have counselors). I wanted to see her handle her anxiety. I wanted to see what interests her. But all I got was her being horny, and her codependency on Johnny. She's still the damsel in distress she was in the first book. Yes, getting almost killed made her talk back to her brother, and mother, but it doesn't help her in any way. They get into the same 'johnny' argument multiple times throughout the book. Not once did she learn how to fight back for herself. All the 'killing them with kindness' at the end was a load of bs, I honestly rolled my eyes so hard at that. Even Shannon's mother had a lot of scope for improvement, but we got nothing.2. Johnny: Just where do I start? What intrigued me the most about him was his dedication towards rugby in the first book (although we got a fat load of tell and no show there). Here, it all goes down the drain because he has a girlfriend, like seriously? We don't get to see his academy evaluation that he was freaking out about for the entirety of the last book. We get barely one or two paragraphs worth details of his first televised match. He isn't even fucking happy when he achieves something he has been working hard for the past 12 years of his life. Doesn't even crack a smile. Why? Because he's worried about 'leaving shannon behind.' Like, seriously, what the actual fuck?3. The romance: *disappointed sigh* I was not rooting for them as a couple. They seriously gave me nothing except exaggerated love confessions that weirded me out because I really did not see where and how the hell had they fallen in love. They were also codependent as hell. Once they got together, almost every single interaction ended up with them entangled with each other, racing off to hornytown. Half of the book was them kissing -> shannon being max horny -> johnny saying it was a bad idea -> them getting cockblocked in the middle of it -> repeat (I'M NOT KIDDING, this exact scene happened like 4/5 times). And their first time, such a cliché scene, honestly made me feel bad for shannon because ain't no way they're convincing me he's experienced in bed with the way that was written. Moreover, I did not need so many explicitly written smut scenes between two teenagers.4. The side characters: I loved Johnny's parents and Gibsie-Claire so much in the last book, I was seriously looking forward to seeing all their interactions. I'll just repeat anmol's words, because she put it perfectly - almost every single side character in this book was either a comic relief or a cockblocker or somebody who was against johnnyxshannon. That's it.5. The dialogue: Oh my god, you will not fucking believe this. Almost every. single. conversation in this book revolved around sex. Johnny and shannon are constantly horny. Johnny and Gibsie are always talking about johnny getting the 'hole' (Which, yikes). Claire wants to know all the details of their sex life. We have multiple conversations where johnny's parents after his dick, or his sex life, and preaching to him and shannon about how they shouldn't have sex at such a young age and all that nonsense. We get a scene of his parents fucking too, and they're just talking with the kids while being half-naked. We get a condom shopping scene. We get Shannon's BABY brothers talking about shannon and johnny shoving tongues in each others mouths, or him being allowed to touch her boobs. We get darren telling shannon to not have sex. We get shannon's mom screaming about how johnny is a r/pist to want to have sex with her minor daughter. We get an elaborate discussion about gibsie's dick, just afterthe fucking funeral scene. When johnny's drunk he's talking about his dick. Like I think I've made my point. But seriously, that's all everybody talked about in this book, and it frustrated me to NO END!6. Appearance: The way they talked about each other's physical appearance was borderline disturbing at some points.She's so small, Gibs. And she's only sixteen.I was painfully aware of the sheer size of him. I was so small in his arms. I was breakable to this boy and it was a troubling thought.He was big and strong and dangerously powerful. Given the chance, he could do some serious physical damage to my body.Yeah, no. I don't like this 😬7. The hero complex: Seriously, everyfuckingbody in the Kavanagh household has a huge hero complex, and I was not here for it. Johnny multiple times takes the blame on himself and burdens himself with guilt when it's not fucking necessary, and nobody is blaming him at all and he's not going to get into trouble, it's just overdramatic and gave me headacheslike the scene where he just took her brothers out to feed them and was acting as if he had kidnapped them, wtf was that😭🙏🏻8. Sob-stories: The way everybody in this book suddenly has a traumatic past or a story that we're just shown a 'hint' of riled me up. Multiple unnecessary conflicts happened at the end of the book, and situations where you just cannot justify what the characters were doing took place so we got those 'hints' for their books, and it really tested my patience.9. Shannon: I know I've talked about her, but I think what gets overlooked is how selfish her character is, and I despised her sometimes.I didn't understand why he had to leave, and I didn't want him to go, but he had signed the paperwork himself just before he stopped talking. He wanted to leave, and I was terrified of Monday coming, because I honestly didn't know how I was going to survive all of this without him.Her brother is going through addiction problems, but all she can think about is herself? Like girl bffr? Multiple times throughout the book, she sees how much joey is wronged and the mental damage he goes through from just being near their mother, but she faults him for leaving. Meanwhile, she isn't making any such choices for her younger brothers, nope.talking about the scene where her dad is back and she's running away and tells johnny to leave her brothers be in the house and not cause trouble 🙂I have much more to ramble about, but this is getting super long, and I just don't have the energy. Safe to say, nobody could pay me enough to read any of this author's books ever again.I know I'm all over the place here so you should readher reviewinstead.

Because, yes, while some of it had NO point whatsoever and did nothing to move the story forward, again: I loved spending more time with these characters.Plus, witty.Also, just as in the first book, this one dealt with hard-hitting topics in a way that didn't feel false or over-dramatized. Were some of the events VERY dramatic? Absolutely. But they never felt contrived.As I have already said, I loved all the characters, especially Johnny and Shannon's friend group.

If I never hear\'Shannon like the river\'again it will be too soon. But these characters wormed their way into my heart despite all of the flaws that I found with the books.So, I cannot even be a hater here- Johnny, Shannon and all of the others have won me over!╰┈➤I loved the growth of Shannon in this book.I will say, that even though I felt terrible for her in book 1 with everything that she had going on at home, and at school and well- in general. She frustrated me to no end. Okay, that\'s harsh, but I did find myself rooting for her to stand up for herself in some way when possible. I don\'t do well with frail FMC\'s so forgive me for some of my criticism of her.In this book, her growth starts to shine. She\'s still insecure and a little grating for me but I found that the more she felt comfortable and loved - she really started to thrive and I loved seeing that for her.╰┈➤Johnny is just amazing. What an amazing, loving, caring, understanding, green flag hunk of a man.I loved how no matter what nothing would deter him from being there for Shannon, and how tender and patient he was with her.Not only was he marvelous with her but with her family. Oh, that makes my heart sing! Her tight relationship with her brothers and despite being amidst all of the family turmoil - he held fast and was a true example of how a love interest should treat his woman/partner.╰┈➤Johnny\'s parents - omg. Shut the front door. They are the best and I love them so much!I feel like I\'ve been through such a long journey with these characters and I love them all so much - I can\'t wait to continue and read Joey\'s story because he is life and deserves all the best.Overall, yes. I have many issues with these books and the writing but at it\'s core it\'s a story about tragedy, love, sacrifice, resilience, growth, compassion, hope and family.

The writing style was fine and the story, while extremely repetitive, was interesting enough for me to finish it. At times I even cried. Though I can\'t imagine ever reading it again.Shannon and JohnnyThe main and my least favorite couple. They had cute and heartbreaking moments, but they are not my type of characters. Sometimes I had to stop reading, because their conversations were so awkward that I needed to take a break. If this book was only focused on them I don’t know if I could do it.I don\'t even want to start with the fact that they tried to do intimate things on almost every occasion they were together. And. Iespeciallydon\'t want to talk about their first time. I want to erase this scene from my memory. Actually, I want to erase every intimate scene from my memory, because reading them felt illegal to me. She was sixteen and he seventeen. I forgot why I stopped reading books about minors.I think the biggest disappointment of the book was when Johnny came back from a rugby trip and when he saw Shannon his first thought was her body. How it changed while he was gone.The last thing that made me finish this book in three months.""I bet he\'s huge and you\'re so tiny…""""She\'s really small okay?

""You don\'t wait, do you hear me?"" Sniffling, he cupped her cheeks in his trembling hands and looked into her eyes.

""I love you, too.""Gerard and ClaireI love Claire, but Gibsie was giving me shudders sometimes. I know he had no filter, but the things this guy said. I didn\'t know whether to laugh or be terrified. I\'m quite disappointed because the \'funny\' of the group of friends usually becomes my favorite.

I snapped, bristling. ""You don\'t hear me talking about any of yer Ma\'s like that!"" ""Because none of our mothers look like your mother,"" Gibsie snickered. ""Mammy K."" He sighed dramatically.

I’m terrified, because I heard Lizzie might cheat with Hughie, and Katie with Feely. I’m praying it’s a joke. Cheating is the worst thing that exists. Lizzie and Feely would be so cute. Lizzie is giving a black cat girlfriend energy and Feely was so sweet, shy and plays the guitar. They had some moments at the end of the book together and I would love to read about them. They have a good chance of being my second favorite couple here. After Joey and Aofie. I hope.""And I\'m so sorry,"" Lizzie sobbed. ""They know,"" Feely replied. Turning to Lizzie, he crooked a finger and said, ""Come here."" ""Wh-what?""""I said come here,"" he repeated in a no-nonsense tone of voice. ""Now."" Stunned, I watched as Lizzie complied without a word and walked over to him. ""Now, you and I are going to go for a walk and let them all cool off,"" Feely said, taking ahold of her hand. ""And we\'re going to come back when everyone here remembers that they\'re not perfect angels."" ""O-okay."" Sniffling, Lizzie nodded and let Feely lead her away from the campsite.""""I\'d leave right now if I had my way.""""Good choice,"" Feely interjected quietly, giving her a small nod. Lizzie blushed.

I'd say that i liked both of them for different reasons.⋆˚࿔shannon:𝜗𝜚˚⋆ she's still an okay fmc to me, i wouldn't say i love her bc at the end i think she didn't have a LOT of growth, she's very fragile, with little self-confidence, always doubting herself.This was our last chance to get to know her more as a fmc and I felt like everything that happened to her was tied to Johnny and she as an individual didn't exist. We know that the path for Johnny is rugby, but what about Shannon???? Literally in the last few chapters they give a hint that she might be interested in being a veteran, but that's it.Shannon never shows any interest in anything, she never has something else to move forward and do something in her future, it seemed like a waste of character development to me, and i don't hate her, because I think all of it is a result of how she lived up until that point, but I don't think she's a great memorable character either.“My binding 13.”I choked out a pained laugh, thinking about that stupid bet.“You heard about that?”“Yeah.”Half-sobbing/ half-laughing, Shannon smiled and nodded.“I won.”“Hands down.”I kissed her puffy lips.“Undisputed.”“Now, I'm keeping 13,”she told me.“So come home to me when you're done, okay?”“I will.”⋆˚࿔johnny:𝜗𝜚˚⋆ he's the star of this book, i will say that until the end of times, he's such a supportive bf, always caring and trying to understand her, he's there for her 24/7 and he's always willing to leave everything aside just to make sure she's okay, he just wants her to be happy, to feel calm and at peace, and that extends to the people she loves as well, like her siblings and even friends.And besides all of that i felt he DID had some character development, regarding how he saw himself and rugby tied together at the start of the story and how by the end he understands that rugby IS a very important part of his life, but also to know that he's so much more than that and he wants to enjoy other things in his youth before that and it's okay.I really loved seeing his dynamic with shannon's siblings, specially sean, like, that's his onny, and i swear i was just expecting him to call him daddy lmao.“I loved her more than I knew what to do with. I could see it all ahead of me: my life, my future, my career, and her. The girl I knew would play the leading role in all of it. I'd thrown it all in with her and I had no doubts. Not a single one. She was my teammate now.”⋆˚࿔joey:𝜗𝜚˚⋆ it was clear that everything was being set up to open up Joey and Aoife's story.As soon as I found out Joey's history with drugs my world fell apart. I just want Joey to have all the good things in this world, to be able to drop the weight on his shoulders, to be able to feel worthy of a happy ending, without worrying about anything other than his well-being and happiness.It broke my heart to see how he was slowly falling apart and the last straw was seeing how, despite having gone through the same thing with Darren 5 years before, he also left home and left his siblings.My only comfort right now is knowing that the next two books are his and that he will have a happy ending and I will be able to see him smile and have the family he deserves, but at the same time it BREAKS me knowing that first I will have to see him suffer (and suffer myself, of course).「 ✦ 𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬 ✦ 」With the first 30% i thought this was going to be 5 stars but then the story got very repetitive. Most of the middle part of the book was Johnny and Shannon having very intimate moments (some cute with deep, important conversations), then getting more and more spicy and finally being cockblocked for whatever reason. I swear it happened at least 5 times and it got tiring at one point.It was just after the fire that i felt everything moved a lot quicker, and i appreciated that. And about that... i joked about shannon's mom being killed off in this one but i was not expecting for that to ACTUALLY happen, so.. just imagine my face. I was too tuned to speak 💀The lack of character growth for Shannon and not having a personality besides loving Johnny also affected my rating. And, just like the previous book, some chapters were unnecessarily stretched and the book could have had 200 less pages without affecting the plot.But still, this book is 4 stars for me because I enjoyed it a lot, I love most of the characters, I care about them and I just want them to be happy.""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""|| 1.0 star ||This book genuinely gave me the biggest headache. It wasso slowandso repetitiveandso long. Not to mention, the non-stop drama and angst was really getting on my nerves, especially since it never actually led anywhere. Nothing actually ever happened; every relationship, every character, every situation, they all pretty much stayed the exact same from beginning to end.This whole book honestly felt like a big trauma dump without anything else happening. These characters are literally nothing more than the heroine HAVING trauma and the hero OBSESSING over her trauma. It got old very quickly.Johnny no longer seemed to care about any of his own future plans or passions and only spent his time worrying about Shannon, while she did nothing other than shiver at the big, bad world and needing constant reassurance about the most basic things. Which, admittedly, makes sense for a girl who went through as much trauma as she did, but she never grew from it. She stayed the same fragile and scared girl with no personality and no brain from start to finish.Furthermore, how is it possible that there have beenso manypages about this couple, and I still felt like there was NO DEPTH to their relationship?? There was no development whatsoever and all of their interactions were beyond dramatic or just about sex. There was no lightness, no romance, no true feelings. It was just non-stop intensity about her being a fragile mess and him wanting to bulldozer all over everything to save her. It was cute the first few times, but almost 2000 pages into their relationship, and I can safely say it became boring and annoying as hell. I just got the ick over her acting like a child 24/7 and him treating her like she was made out of glass all the time. It was definitely not a normal relationship dynamic; it was trauma bonding for Shannon and a savior complex for Johnny.Also, their dialogue was literally the exact same every single time; all of their scenes together were pretty much identical. I kid you not. It was insufferable and so badly written.I’m actually convinced every other relationship in this book was better written and developed than the main couple. I actually especially liked Gibsie. His friendship with Johnny was probably the best, and his potential romance with Claire was also full of life and banter. Shannon’s brothers had a few heartbreaking scenes with Johnny’s family as well. Ollie was a sweetheart, but Sean? Oh my, that sweet little baby broke my heart. The way Johnny took care of him was the sweetest thing.I also just want to say one last quick thing: The whole Bella storyline never made sense to me and just pissed me off beyond compare. The fact that nobody ever put this horrible girl in her place was just insane. You’re telling me the most popular guys in school can’t ruin a slutty, jealous girl who’s behaving like a deranged stalker? No way. I’m not buying it. She should have been at the bottom of the food chain at that school in minutes, but somehow it never happened? Insane.Anyway, long story short, this was just a very very bad book. The whole thing literally read like Wattpad to me and this author desperately needed an editor to skim the hell out of these million pages about absolutelynothing.'Boys of Tommen' series:1.Binding 13- 3.0 stars2.

Especially in the first half it felt quite repetitive, and like it wasn\'t really going anywhere.That is not to say that I did not enjoy this book. I still desperately love this series and it\'s characters. There are definitely some scenes in this book that I will keep in my heart forever.However, for this being a romance, I will say the romance is not what stood out most to me.✦“I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone like him before.”“That’s because the world can only handle one Gerard Gibson.”✦I need a moment for Gibsie. His comedic timing, insane mind and unconditional love towards Johnny is everything and more. I loved seeing the snippets of him and Claire as well, as understanding his motivators a bit better. I am so looking forward to reading his book to understand what goes on inside that mind of his. He was such a highlight for me throughout this book, even if the pacing was slower at times you could always count on Gibsie to say something inappropriate to bring a smile to your lips.✧""“I made it worse for you” he strangled out.“You made it bearable” I whispered.”✧Another major highlight was Johnny\'s parents. Their endless support and love made my heart feel all warm and toasty. Their instant welcoming of Shannon and Joey made me sob my heart out, as well as with the rest of the family.There are no other fictional characters that compare in the utter goodness those people emit.They did absolutely everything right in how they raised Johnny, becausewhat a man, what a man, what a mighty good man.🎵Everything from how he communicates, to how he acts. Even when he fucks up he does it right.This man can do no wrong.I love how reassuring he is with Shannon, knowing her situation, being unsure what the right things to say are but always manages to get the right words out.Their love is clear as day and they truly bring out the best out of each other. Even though it\'s young love, their first love, they both share the experience of growing up too fast. You can tell how this also have an impact on their relationship, in how seriously they take it, how they respect each other and how theyplay for keeps.✦“I felt the shift; the switch from this being something sweet and innocent, to deeply complicated with the hint of forever.”✦✧“You promise?”“I promise a million, billion promises.”✧_________⌞pre-read:⌝Yeah, we\'re gonna have to start this right away🥲'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'ᯓ★「“i can only tell you what i know, that from the very first day you walked into my life, you changed me. that very first time i saw you?

(don\'t torture your ass guys it\'s not pleasurable, trust me, trust this book.)as much as I loved the first book, this one came with disappointment so immeasurable, my day is completely ruined.this won\'t be a long review, well bcz there\'s nothing this book offered to talk about in the first place.1.REPEAT AFTER FUCKING REPEAT.i\'m telling y\'all if this ain\'t a copy paste of the first book- except johnny apparently no longer cares about rugby since that factor was completely shoved under the carpet, L bombs here and there since the start of the book, two horny idiots humping each other every chance they get and then running off bcz ""no sex rule"", gibsie whoring around sexualising people\'s mums and sisters, more dick talk, and yes, the heroic brother is back with his milk: Darren.2. the character arc was not arcing. the fact that the side characters were wayyy moreee interesting than the main couple was beyond embarrassing💀 i absolutely adored shannon+johnny in binding 13, i\'d sell my soul for them, but sorry my comrades, they did not do it for me in this one. i was dragging my pathetic ass through their povs, hoping for another glance of gibsie, clarie, mammy kav, daddy kav, joey, hell anyone except these two. their private interactions physically pained me. here\'s how it always went:J: Hi Shannon.S: Hi Johnny.J: are you okay?S: um... idk i guess? what do you think?J: you\'re literally so tiny lolz, but it\'s about what you want, are you okay?S: ig not... i\'m so so scared johnny, my father is back in da town💔 also, you\'re so big.J: i love you. anyways, are you okay?S: um i- i- yeah?J: you sure right?S: yeahJ: are you okay? don\'t lie to me, you tiny little toddlerS: chile anyways let\'s kiss*cut to dry humping*J: no we should not be doing thisS: you\'re literally so bigger than me, my tiny little body wants all of you.J: you sure?S: no actually i\'m not lol. yk i can\'t say yes, how else will i repeat this cycle?J: you okay shan?S: johnny i\'m so scared-AND THIS IS HOW IT WENT EVERY SINGLE FUCKING TIME. IT NEVER ENDED. MY MISERY NEVER SUBSIDED.shannon\'scharacter arc is what dissatisfied me the most. she was the most plain boring character ever. i get her past, her trauma. i understand her and i get why she reacts to things the way she does, i get why she\'s so scared all the damn time, but by the end i wanted her to stand up on her feet and fight her own battles. throughout the book she was so codependent on joey and johnny, and i understand why, but i wanted that to change by the end. that\'s the character development i was expecting, but all the girl ever did was kiss and hump johnny.johnnycompletely lost his individuality in this one. his sheer passion for rugby, his drive, his craziness for the sport, all poof in the air like that. it was as if being shannon\'s support system was the only role he was programmed to play. and ofc, role no. 2 was to sexually please her. why do we even need men for anyway?joeyslayed as always. he\'s the only one that kept me going. he\'s the protector we all need in our lives. my poor baby has been mentally ruined, COMPLETELY, and i love it bcz that means he\'s gonna serve well in his book babyy!ik this was going downhill when my lovegibsiealso started annoying me to no ends. he was hella weird in this one. i still do love him (i think?) but he needs to stop seriously. the repeated sexual comments that he passed to others mothers and sisters gave me an ick. all he ever does is make sexual innuendos and talk about fucking and fucking and more fucking. and i don\'t blame claire for the insecurity she has in their relationship, gibsie\'s a manwhore, every woman he meets, his very first thought is how fuckable she is. i see no depth in his character. but ik that\'s not the case (taming 7 is coming soon babyy), ik he has some past and humour is his coping mechanism (he just like me fr). but as far as this book is concerned, he was annoying as hell.i\'m so afraid to continue this series. these books are longer than my will to live (which is a lot), but if they continue the same way, it won\'t be long before my will to live would be cut short and this series would bore me to death!until next time folks xx.'}]"

The Midnight Library
",Matt Haig,3.99,2023247,8177,"Fiction, Fantasy, Audiobook, Contemporary, Magical Realism, Science Fiction, Mental Health",288,13-08-2020,"Between life and death there is a library.When Nora Seed finds herself in the Midnight Library, she has a chance to make things right. Up until now, her life has been full of misery and regret. She feels she has let everyone down, including herself. But things are about to change.The books in the Midnight Library enable Nora to live as if she had done things differently. With the help of an old friend, she can now undo every one of her regrets as she tries to work out her perfect life. But things aren't always what she imagined they'd be, and soon her choices place the library and herself in extreme danger.Before time runs out, she must answer the ultimate question: what is the best way to live?","[{'rating': 2, 'content': 'I liked this book until it suddenly decided to moonlight as a self-help manual, replete with messages that would look great and profound on an Instagram post next to a well-posed cup of coffee with those foam pictures on top. Or embroidered on a pillow — pick your poison.“She realised that she hadn’t tried to end her life because she was miserable, but because she had managed to convince herself that there was no way out of her misery.”And these messages have the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Forget the readers figuring it out for themselves — no, the moral and the take-home points will be (didactically) in your face, loud and clear, even if it’s awkward and clunky and stops narration in its tracks. Case in point:“As she switched to freestyle she realised it wasn’t her fault that her parents had never been able to love her the way parents were meant to: without condition.”Some of these platitudes would also feel right at home in the Hallmark holiday special movie:“And … and the thing is … the thing is … what we consider to be the most successful route for us to take, actually isn’t. Because too often our view of success is about some external bullshit idea of achievement – an Olympic medal, the ideal husband, a good salary. And we have all these metrics that we try and reach. When really success isn’t something you measure, and life isn’t a race you can win.”And I’m just not big on self-help or motivational books. I find most of them cheesy and corny and really awkward and often so painfully earnest that I just can’t take them seriously. It’s just me - I guess I don’t have the right personality to appreciate them. And so I was not too happy with the turn the story took.—————The premise was interesting, and the beginning actually had me captivated. It’s a story of a woman who’s had her final straw - a whole bunch of final straws, really - and when gripped by the oppressive darkness of depression decides to commit suicide.“Maybe she was just really crap at it. At life.”“She wanted to have a purpose, something to give her a reason to exist. But she had nothing.”This may be why so many of even middle-aged people like reading Young Adult books — there’s something quite comforting about seeing a brand-new person, right at the cusp of adulthood, when all the possibilities are still there and no clocks have yet started ticking, and there is enough time and energy to regroup and move on to the road not yet taken. But Nora is thirty-five, an age considered way too late (especially for women, with that damn idea of a biological clock) to not have it all figured out. It’s not the time (at least for women) when the world is considered to be your oyster —it’s the time when you really are expected to have your shit together. And Nora most certainly does not.“Well, don’t hang about. Tick-tock tick-tock”,says a well-meaning stranger in that unasked-for-but-nonetheless-given bit of advice.“When she thought about it – and increasingly she had been thinking about it – Nora was only able to think of herself in terms of the things she wasn’t. The things she hadn’t been able to become. And there really were quite a lot of things she hadn’t become.”In that moment between life and death Nora finds herself in a library full of books that are the alternate lives she could have had — lives that would have stemmed from one different choice, one different decision. (Jo Walton’s quiet gemMy Real Childrenhad a similar premise, and it was wonderful). And the point is - once Nora finds a perfect life for herself in this endless tapestry of parallel and “perpendicular” lives, she can choose to stay in it and live it as her own.The logical place to start is to revisit all those regrets that weigh her down. And Nora has quite a few of those.“Between life and death there is a library,’ she said. ‘And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices … Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?”And then, after a great beginning (which was not always easy to read given how well Haig was able to capture the snowballing depressing crap happening to Nora)we careen right into the didactic self-help book where each parallel life exists to teach Nora a lesson that sooner or later will be unambiguously spelled out so that we don’t get it wrong.“She realised, in that moment, that she was capable of a lot more than she had known.”And if you had any doubts about the ending, doubt no more. It ends exactly like anyone would have predicted at the beginning of that self-help turn, exceptit’s even more unrealistically saccharine than I even dared to anticipate. It takes a turn into that meaningless “let you be you” drivel that seems to say so much while actually saying very little. It becomes the cotton candy of advice - sweet but of little value.“She didn’t need a vineyard or a Californian sunset to be happy. She didn’t even need a large house and the perfect family. She just needed potential. And she was nothing if not potential. She wondered why she had never seen it before.”And all that relentless hammering of the “profound” message into to readers’ psyche interspersed with tired cliches makes the whole book eventually seem bland and repetitive and tedious and, honestly, a bit trite.“I mean, it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other.”2.5 stars. I did not sign up to read a self-help manual.But my opinion is decidedly in the minority — maybe I’m just a crusty soulless cynic. Oh well.————“You don’t have to understand life. You just have to live it.’Nora shook her head. This was a bit too much for a Philosophy graduate to take.”It’s a bit too much for this science graduate over here, too.——————Also posted onmy blog.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '""That is just me. I add nothing. I am wallowing in self-pity.""No truer words have been said by Nora, the world\'s largest wet blanket. Woe is her, folks.Nora ends up at the Midnight Library, a place between life and death, because she doesn\'t want to live anymore. The library is full of books, each representing a life she could\'ve had had she made different choices. Now she has a chance to undo all her regrets (of which there are many) and try out all the lives she\'s missed out on, to see if there\'s another one she would\'ve liked better.Lest you think I\'m a cold-hearted reader for not loving this, I mean, sure that does sound like me. I count coins in my bathtub, chase children off my lawn with my gnarly walking stick, and club seals for laughs at least once a day, if not more. So what\'s to like? No no, I\'m just kidding. Really.Normally I love sappy, cheesy, inspirational mush. I watch Hallmark movies. I believe in soulmates and happily ever after. I cry during every sweet scene in every movie. And yet this book left me so cold inside, I got absolutely zero feels unless you count frustration as a feel.For one thing, this story doesn\'t come across as fiction so much as self-help disguised as fiction. The lessons to be learned in here are pretty obvious right from the beginning, yet they are presented like some sort of epiphany that can only be discerned if explained slowly and repeatedly. We are forced to endure these same lessons over and over every time Nora goes back to the library. Either Nora is the most dim witted of characters, or the author thinks us readers are.Another problem is that it\'s really hard to connect with Nora. She\'ll take any situation, suck every ounce of joy out of it, and interpret what\'s left in the most negative way possible. She\'s full of regret for every decision she\'s ever made, and thinks the grass is always greener. However, other than being negative, she literally has no other personality traits. She\'s a blank slate, dull and uninteresting.I also have issues with the core messages in this book. Nora finally learns her lesson, but it\'s only after having fixated on each regret, remade every decision, and lived all subsequent lives. Like come on, at some point, you just have to be okay with who you are and the decisions you\'ve made without knowing every single possible outcome.But my biggest issue is that I\'m really uncomfortable with this book\'s implication that if you\'re depressed, you only need to change your mindset and you will feel better. That goes against everything we understand about mental illness, including that it\'s important to seek professional help, that it can be chemically based, and that it\'s not a matter of not trying hard enough.We already have enough trouble as a society getting depression and mental illness taken seriously, without a ""feelgood"" book coming along and implying that you need nothing more than an attitude adjustment to cure it. That puts the blame squarely where it doesn\'t belong, on the hundreds of millions of people who are suffering from depression. But it isn\'t just the layman who harbors such misunderstandings. It also includes people who work in the mental health field, and even some therapists and psychiatrists. So you can understand my dismay at the continued popularity of this book, which further perpetrates this extremely toxic point of view.Please don\'t get me wrong. The message in here about having a positive attitude is a good one, and I\'m all for it. But that worthwhile message slowly but surely got overshadowed by the implication that depression is nothing more than a mindset, and that\'s where I fall off the bandwagon. At times, I\'m left wondering if the author started with the intention of the former and, over the course of writing this story, it somehow got away from him and he ended up with the latter instead.Obviously many readers loved this book, as evidenced by its overwhelmingly favorable reviews. But it\'s decidedly not for me. This is the second book I\'ve read by Matt Haig, and I\'ve pretty much hated both. So I think it\'s time I part ways with this author and just accept that we\'re not compatible.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:How to Stop Time~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""“The only way to learn is to live”Fuck, this book hit me so hard. I finished this book a few days ago and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. It has one of my favorite themes or tropes in a book, where we follow a main character who at the beginning of the story is very depressed and possible suicidal and doesn't see the point of life, but then slowly throughout the story begins to build an admiration toward humanity and life. This book was so beautifully written and I love the way this book asks the question: what is the best way to live?“Between life and death there is a library, and within that library, the shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices… Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?”It's a really cool concept, that between life and death you enter the midnight library, where you get the opportunity to see how your life would've been different had you made different decisions. I think a lot about this, what my life would be like had I made different choices and wondering if I'm the happiest version of myself? This book forces you to ask hard questions, like what makes a life worth living? And are your dreams for yourself really something you want? I love the way this book talks about regrets and how most of the time our regrets are a load of bullshit of things that are out of our control and they are causing a major burden on our life.“A person was like a city. You couldn't let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole. There may be bits you don't like, a few dodgy side streets and suburbs, but the good stuff makes it worth-while.”Matt Haig is such a talented writer and there are so many passages and quotes I'm obsessed with in this book. Much like The Humans (one of my all time favorites) this book has you questioning what the point of life is and thinking how truly absurd life can be. But I feel like this book is much more serious than The Humans, there are trigger warnings for depression and suicidal thoughts in this book, and it was very very heavy on my heart to read this book, where as The Humans feels a lot more light-hearted and hilarious.“It is easy to mourn the lives we aren't living. Easy to wish we'd developed other other talents, said yes to different offers. Easy to wish we'd worked harder, loved better, handled our finances more astutely, been more popular, stayed in the band, gone to Australia, said yes to the coffee or done more bloody yoga. It takes no effort to miss the friends we didn't make and the work we didn't do the people we didn't do and the people we didn't marry and the children we didn't have. It is not difficult to see yourself through the lens of other people, and to wish you were all the different kaleidoscopic versions of you they wanted you to be. It is easy to regret, and keep regretting, ad infinitum, until our time runs out. But it is not lives we regret not living that are the real problem. It is the regret itself. It's the regret that makes us shrivel and wither and feel like our own and other people's worst enemy. We can't tell if any of those other versions would of been better or worse. Those lives are happening, it is true, but you are happening as well, and that is the happening we have to focus on.”But god damn, I loved this book. I cried a lot at the end. I'll be thinking about this book for a long time. I also filmed a reading vlog and I included this book, you can see that here:https://youtu.be/9NiJtrbogyo""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""Everybody probably knows the premise of this book by now (I mean this book iseverywhere): a library with an infinite number of books. The books of regret. You open one and it transfers you to the life where you didn’t make that particular regret. Was it marrying someone or traveling or maybe other little things.While I admit I don’t actively pursue parallel universes kind of books on one hand, and on the other, the main reason why I read this book is that I was choosing the best fiction this year (to vote in the GR awards), I was actually looking forward to it. Most of my friends on GR gave it 5 glowing stars. A book beloved by the majority... I had a high chance of enjoying it. Sadly, I didn’t.First, it was boring. I listened to the audiobook and the narrator wasn’t the best, honestly. Not that her voice was annoying but it was kind of monotone. It certainly didn’t help either that I was listening toEleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fineat the same time, in which the narrator was so animated reading the book.I also found all of Nora’s revelations and enlightenment typical. Like sure I already know that. The ending was also painfully predictable from the start. So when you can guess where the book is going, everything in between becomes not so interesting anymore, especially if you don’t care about the main character. Unfortunately, I found Nora dull. She wasn’t interesting as the main character and I couldn’t relate nor care about her and empathise with her story. I can’t believe she was this multitalented in fields that aren’t related whatsoever to each other. She could’ve been an athlete, a scholar or a musician. All successful. All are based on life decisions. I also think that she had the privilege of choosing such different options. Many don’t. I don’t mean by that the book of regrets but rather focusing on a particular career path from the start. For example, many parents don’t nurture their children’s interests like music or gymnastics for several reasons maybe they can’t afford it or they just don’t care. But Nora had so many options.Luckily, the book was short. I also didn’t hate anything about it, hence the 2-star rating. But at the same time, I can’t name anything I liked. Maybe one of the lives, in particular, was more intriguing than the rest because of the two characters we met and.. the concept. It didn’t help that the book got repetitive sometimes. The premise was much more promising than the book itself. The “message” was also pretty plain obvious. Yet many likedThe Midnight Library, however. So it might be more of a “me and not you” kind of book.But let me tell you this: if you don’t find the parallel universes interesting to read about in stories, don’t read this novel. Don’t be fooled with “LIBRARY. MIDNIGHT LIBRARY. BOOOOOKS.” The library is just more of a metaphor. Most of the events in this book take place in the real world. And unless you’re interested in kind of self-help books (or motivational ones), don’t read this novel either. Because it’s more about what Nora discovered about herself and life, of course, by dealing with/trying to escape from her regrets.But then again, themajorityliked this book so you might too and it's simply notmycup of tea.Yet, itwasa dreadfully boring.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'So, first of all, HUGE thank you to goodreads for featuring my kindle highlights and notes for this book - wow.I never would\'ve expected such an amazing opportunity to share my love for this book NOR would I have expected to ""meet"" so many wonderful people through the comments.It\'s been so much fun and I\'m definitely doing more highlights/notes soon!!The Written ReviewLife has just gotten to the point where it\'soverwhelming and all-encompassingand above all, Nora can\'t see a possible situation where it gets better.Everyone she\'s ever known has pulled away, her job is gone and her best friend in the world passes.All she\'s left with is herself and acripplingly black hole.She slips herself a few too many pills and then drifts...andfinds herself in a library.Not just any library though, the Midnight Library.Guided by a person who may (or may not) be Mrs. Elm (young Nora\'s favorite teacher), Nora begins to take a look at the shelves.And every book is her.

His acute observations and experience of his condition informs this exquisite, inspiring, compassionate and empathetic novel where he creates the concept of the midnight library, to be found in the spaces between life and death, to explore life, the issues that afflict our world, through philosophy and more, endeavouring to tease out what might make life worth living and a joy and what gives it meaning. The device used to implement his goal is the ordinary Nora Seed, who has lived her life trying to please others, who has hit rock bottom, suffering the loss of her cat, her job, overwhelmed by the burden of a lifetime of regrets, seeing no light in her life whatsoever. She is tempted by thoughts of suicide that has her ending up at the midnight library.The midnight library is magical, for a start, the library has a limitless number of books, and these books are far from ordinary, Haig sprinkles gold dust in each book, offering Nora the opportunity to see how her life would have turned out if each and every decision at every point in her life had been different. The books illustrate the endless possibilities that life holds for Nora and all of us. Nora explores each book, with inquisitiveness and curiosity, the widely disparate lives that could have been hers, no easy task as she has to slip into each new life with the complications of being unfamiliar with it and do so without alerting the other people present. It soon becomes clear that there are pros and cons to each book/life, to each decision and choice made, each life containing its own mix of despair, pain and regrets that must be accommodated and handled.Haig offers a touching narrative that speaks of the joys to be found in living, attained through Nora's eyes as she tries to untangle what really matters in life, putting life in context and perspective with all its ongoing changes, complexities, and an understanding no life is perfect in itself. In some ways, this is a version of It's A Wonderful Life, a favourite film for so many people. What I was so struck by is just how many readers might find this helpful for our lock down times, so many have suffered unbearable losses and illness, have had to face not seeing all those we love and mean so much to us, whilst being weighed down with worries and concerns about how to cope with fears regarding jobs, childcare, money and more. A beautifully nuanced novel that I am sure many will love as much as me. Highly recommended. Many thanks to Canongate for an ARC.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Okay! No more words! This is one of the best sci-fi and fantasy mashups of the year, with an added layer of philosophical depth. I LOVED IT!

If you’ve read the song lyrics to “Howl” in the book, you’ll probably understand why I’m so enthusiastic and why I’m writing this loud, passionate review!)This book isn’t just about Nora Seed, a woman trapped in her life, seeing herself as a failure, as disposable, with nothing to achieve and no one who would miss her. It’s about regrets, unfinished plans, “what ifs,” seeking family approval, drugs, mistakes, giving up, living out others’ dreams, self-loathing, insecurities, self-harm, love, passion, and hate.When Nora attempts to end her life, she wakes up in a library filled with books—each one containing a different version of her life story. If she finds the right book, the life in which she’s truly fulfilled and happy, she can be saved.Thankfully, the librarian, Mrs. Elm, is there for her—just as she was when Nora was a little girl grieving her father’s death.Nora could have been so many things: a swimmer, a rock star, a philosopher, a wife, a traveler, a glaciologist, a mother, a winery or pub owner. She could have said “yes” to her ex’s offer to move to a small town and run a pub together. Or she could have accepted a coffee date from Ash, the charming doctor, in pursuit of love and happiness. She could have won Olympic medals or tasted the alluring fame of performing her music all over the world. She could have been anything.But after living through nearly a thousand different lives, will she discover which one is truly the best for her? Which life will allow her to capture real happiness?Can she live without her family, or bear the pain of losing her friends?What does she truly want? What does she expect? And most importantly, will she learn to face the things she regrets most? Because no matter how ready she is to start fresh, the grip of her regrets always pulls her back, preventing her from seeing what she’s truly searching for.Beautiful, meaningful, dazzling, emotional, heart-wrenching, poetic, and realistic—these are the words that come to mind after reading this book.

Or is it the case that depression is a consequence of environment, one’s less than sane immediate family perhaps; or possibly genetics, an historical aberration passed down from family far distant in space and time? Is the world an objectively depressing place; or made so by our attitude towards it? The philosopher Schopenhauer thought depression was an heroic human condition and promoted it by writing about it; Freud thought it was an illness and tried to cure it by talking about it.Haig thinks depression has something to do with regrets, that is, thoughts about what might have been if we had done things differently. And perhaps he has a point. In his view, regrets occur because of alternative histories we fabricate for ourselves in which disappointment with one’s lot is reduced or eliminated because life would be more fulfilling/successful/happy than the life one actually has. Depression, in other words, is a literary phenomenon. It’s a result of the what-if stories. Imaginative, articulate people, therefore, would be particularly susceptible to the condition. There is in fact substantial anecdotal evidence that this might be so (see, for example,https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...)Based on this essentially linguistic theory of depression, Haig has a suggestion for therapy. At this point he crosses the line from playful fictional speculation to a less than savoury quackery worthy of Ayn Rand and Tim LaHaye. Haig thinks that some down-to-earth horror stories are just the thing to augment the happily-ever-after alternatives in our heads. Re-write the script, he implies, picking up all the tiny contra-indications of bliss because“undoing regrets was really a way of making wishes come true.”Or just remember that people, jobs, relationships, and desires change. Perhaps what was the case about these things when the alternative history was written hadn’t persisted. Or the outcomes remain the same despite different choices. Haig’s point, I suppose, is that things could be worse; that maybe Leibniz had it right: this world could be the best of all possible worlds. Disappointment with one’s regrets as a cure for regrets, and therefore a therapy for disabling, suicidal depression?Things could be worse!? That’s your therapeutic message? Are you serious, Matt?Haig even makes a pitch for a sort of group therapy in which those formulating alternatives to the alternatives get together for solace and encouragement. And of course he feels compelled to bring in quantum mechanics to bolster the non-literary reality of simultaneous lives - a cliché I was mightily hoping he might avoid. And the allusion to YHWH as the master of ceremonies (very Leibnizian), in the guise of a benevolent librarian, keeping all the disparate quantum selves in line is pretty cheesy. Ultimately Haig opts for the cheesiest of all criterion for the story one must have about one’s life: authenticity, we must be our realest, bestest, truest self.“Aim to be the truest version of you,”the godly librarian suggests, as if a depressive has a choice in the matter. I think Haig may have been to one too many EST seminars, or at least spent too much time in Southern California reading Heidegger on the beach.Of course in creating these new personal stories another issue eventually arises if one���s authentic self is the depressed wreck one started with. Then“It is quite a revelation to discover that the place you wanted to escape to is the exact same place you escaped from,”says Haig’s protagonist, brought back from the brink of suicidal death. But the important point, according to Haig, is“You just had to never give up on the idea that there would be a life somewhere that could be enjoyed.”Can one help thinking of Eric Idle’s magnificent rendition of ‘Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life’ in theLife Of Brian? Did I mention cheesy.I think it clear thatThe Midnight Libraryis a grave insult to those suffering from depression. It is a facile, trivial, misdirected, and (did I mention?) cheesy book. Am I entirely off-base in thinking Haig wrote it as a feel-good piece for those who just need a little pat on the back for their recovery from a bout of the blues, or a failed love affair?

Nora Seed might seed our mind with melancholy and heart with love in her quest for perfection. Can perfection be attained through the careful movement of the pawns in this deliberate game of life? Through the underlying current of sadness, this literature transcends us to a library between the universes with a librarian who is a mental metaphor that can be fathomed only by a few.“Aisles and aisles of bookshelves, reaching up to the ceiling and branching off from the broad open corridor. Books were everywhere. The shelves really did seem to go on forever, straight and long to the far off horizon. There were no title and names adorning the spines of the books.”The library between life and death with a vagabond poacher through multiverses, who gave an open invitation to death and didn’t want to be preserved from death as she can’t decide how she wants to live.“You don’t go to death, but the death comes to you”The fact that the day never ends due to the never-ending light is like living one terminal day. It is exceptionally depressing for an already depressed person who decided to die by traveling with her best companion - solitude from a society so lonely owing to the detachment due to the extreme social media attachment.Does life seem more attractive in the face of death? Is death the one that makes life beautiful? Is death an obligate parasite that wants to change the relationship to a symbiotic one with life?Is the simplification of the three-dimensional worlds by humans making it more complicated?“This is the wrong life. It is really, really, really wrong. Take me back. I do want to avenge.

She is mugged, loses her job, blamed for other’s people’s failures, and her cat is run over by a car. She is also seriously depressed. This day is one of many bad days that Nora has experienced over the last decade of her life. She can’t take life anymore and attempts suicide.Nora wakes up to discover that she is in the space between life and death known as The Midnight Library. Here, Nora is given the opportunity to take the paths she didn’t choose and undo her regrets. She travels into the multiverse, getting to experience her other lives.What she finds is that the grass isn’t always greener, and in order to live, one must push aside their regrets and embrace their potential.“She just needed potential. And she was nothing if not potential.There are many versions of Nora, but she finds she is the same person in every life she chooses. She might be happier, but she doesn’t have what she needs, which is love. She cannot heal until she can open up and accept the love of others, but also love herself and recognize her value.I love Nora’s character. I felt all of her emotions, the dark, and the light. She is fragile, desperate, adventurous, a rockstar, a loving sister, a good friend, a kind neighbor, a good teacher, and, most importantly, a survivor.This is my first book by Matt Haig and I love how he weaves in bits of magic, fantasy, and whimsy alongside Quantum physics, literature, and philosophy.This is an emotional read. Reading about a character who is in such a desperate state of mind that they attempt to take their life wasn’t easy, but the other side of this book offers a lot of love, warmth, compassion, and healing. It was surprisingly heartwarming and uplifting.Nora��s story inspired me to turn off the channel of regrets that often fill my head and embrace the here and now.I received an ARC of this book from NetGalley and Penguin Group in exchange for an honest review.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is the ultimate “what if I had done it differently?” story. I guarantee it will make you think and might give you some new perspective on life. Also, while it starts a bit dark, I think people who are looking for a way out of a dark place might find this story uplifting overall.I have been sitting here thinking about how to review this book and I don’t want to say too much about it because after 10 pages or so, everything little thing would be a spoiler! That, in itself, should probably pique your interest; it is so packed with interconnected and surprising content I can barely even talk about it! So, just read it because all the stuff that happens is totally worth it . . . I’ll leave it at that.I was hooked by this book from page one.

Trigger warning: suicide attempt. 😬 She’s pushed into The Midnight Library, where her school librarian greets her and explains the books of regret.

I’d recommend this to anyone and everyone!! It is AMAZING!! ❤️📚'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'This book’s message could have been inscribed on an inspirational poster or a very large coffee mug.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I ABSOLUTELY, TOTALLY, UNEQUIVOCALLY LOVED THIS BOOK!!!Who hasn\'t had regrets - wished they\'d taken a different path in life, loved more and hated less, studied a little harder, applied themselves a bit more, had more faith in themselves, wished they\'d liked themselves for who they were instead of what others wanted them to be?I\'m certainly not immune, and I\'ve actually fulfilled a couple of my life\'s ambitions, but life is not easy for any of us. As Nora was to discover, we all ""fear life"" to some degree - we learn pretty young that actions can have pretty painful consequences.Some of us stare that fear in the face and do what frightens us anyway. Many more of us, however, will step back and opt to take the safer road. I loved the notion of Nora being able to insert herself in a parallel timeline and see how her life would have been like had she taken a chance on all of those potentially life changing events. The whole parallel universe notion was so tantalizing! Imagine if you, too, could examine and then finally burn your own Book of Regrets and just move on with living your best life now?The first third of this novel is heavily mired in depression. If you\'ve never felt stuck or depressed, you will certainly get a clue of what it feels like after you\'ve read or listened to those first few chapters leading up to Nora\'s attempted suicide. There was a history of depression in Nora\'s mother\'s family. I was not surprised that Nora fell into depression after taking care of her mother during her long, protracted illness. Death has a way of stopping the clock for the survivors and making them examine the value of their own life. I suspect there will be many who will identify with most of what Nora thinks and says in this novel.Nora\'s Midnight Library is guarded and managed by her beloved childhood mentor and high school librarian, Mrs. Elm. There are several chapters devoted to Mrs. Elm\'s struggle to get Nora to try to experience one of the parallel lives in her Midnight library. This reflects the very real battle that a person with depression must face to get to the point where they can finally admit that they need help to get ""unstuck."" Matt Haig has given a whole new meaning to the word ""potential."" I totally agreed with Nora\'s final decision at the end of the book. In fact, I saw it coming even before she had completed her first journey. We can\'t live someone else\'s life. The choice must truly be our own if we want any abiding sense of fulfillment.This author - this book - has a lot to teach us. I am so very glad that I decided to check out what all the hype was about: turns out, all that hype was fully merited ! Loved every bit of it, including the sad parts. A full five out of five glowing stars for this heart-stirring, sanity-saving novel.

",Sarah J. Maas,4.47,1530793,8152,"Fantasy, Romance, Romantasy, Fiction, Fantasy Romance, Audiobook, Fae",757,16-02-2021,"Nesta Archeron has always been prickly-proud, swift to anger, and slow to forgive. And ever since being forced into the Cauldron and becoming High Fae against her will, she's struggled to find a place for herself within the strange, deadly world she inhabits. Worse, she can't seem to move past the horrors of the war with Hybern and all she lost in it.The one person who ignites her temper more than any other is Cassian, the battle-scarred warrior whose position in Rhysand and Feyre's Night Court keeps him constantly in Nesta's orbit. But her temper isn't the only thing Cassian ignites. The fire between them is undeniable, and only burns hotter as they are forced into close quarters with each other.Meanwhile, the treacherous human queens who returned to the Continent during the last war have forged a dangerous new alliance, threatening the fragile peace that has settled over the realms. And the key to halting them might very well rely on Cassian and Nesta facing their haunting pasts.Against the sweeping backdrop of a world seared by war and plagued with uncertainty, Nesta and Cassian battle monsters from within and without as they search for acceptance-and healing-in each other's arms.","[{'rating': 1, 'content': '✨hardcore Nesta and Cassian fans need not engage. shoo !!✨She drew up short. “I’m not afraid of anything.”but you will be afraid of me when I rant about you. bitch.Now on to the point which is this book. Oh, this book. Oh, this damn, freaking pathetic book. This has been: One of the worst experiences of my life. I\'m freaking salty and I need a refund of my expectations.Let me make something clear. This book actually made me realize that iusedto like the original trilogy a lot. But - SJMruined every. single. thing.She ruined everything good about those precious, loveable books and characters. So, now I just hate everyone 😊Now, what are the actual good things in this book you may askanything that is not Cassian, Nesta, Mor, Amren, Feyre, Rhysand• LUCIEN• AZRIEL•He said Feyre Darling and she told him no goodbyes Rhys• the endThis book was entriely useless. Things this book has include:• cringey talk• Nesta and Cassian (what\'s their ship name?) scaring me to death.• bad, horribly redundant writing• Nesta\'s inner fire blah blah• Nesta eating my brain•Cassian\'s cock rubbing against the seam of his pantsevery two pages (literally i\'m not even joking)• bad sex• Nesta screaming about how she sucks• mate• Nesta thinking she owns the world• everyone looking at Nesta and falling to their knees (hulk smash)• everyone looking at Nesta and sayingmother save you(i will gouge my eyes out if i have to read ""mother save you"" ever again)• Nesta getting a new superpower every 50 pages. i mean it.• NESTA AND CASSIAN BEING OH SO PRETTY• a lot of boring girl talk• Cassian and Nesta doing it everywhere• boring Nesta things which i skipped• Nesta being a bitch the entire book and doing inexcusable shit and then apologizing in the last 50 pages or sth and suddenly everyone forgives herrr• some boring side characters• an absolutely boring plotline (non-existent is a better word)• and as soon as things between Nesta and Cassian are resolved, the plot was dissolved into thin airBasically, this book sucked. badly. I wanted to crawl into a freaking hole and die. My eyes are literally bleeding from the amount of stupidity in this book.AND THE SIMILARITIES I CAN DRAW BETWEEN THIS BOOK AND ACOMAF(but let\'s be real ACOMAF is superior with a really good plotline, an actual love letter for people to heal, good chemistry, excellent characters and with an amazing ending).Firstly - Nesta and Cassian:Nestaaaaaaaaaaaa. THE BITCH. She did nothing, nothing while Feyre provided for them AND STILL, SHE BLAMES EVERY SINGLE PERSON. Like she was mad that Feyre found a new family but basically Nesta did everything in her power to push Feyre out of the picture when they were human. I do get it that some people protect themselves by using angry words or whatever BUT to me she just seemed like aselfish bitch. And when everyone finally grew sick of her bullshit she\'s like: oh my god everyone hates me.Yes, I do. I do hate you.(Update:Someone told me i was being disrespectful towards people who suffer from PTSD. Well, it certainly wasn\'t what I was saying but if, in anyway, my words have hurt you then I\'m extremely sorry.BUT Nesta\'s PTSD doesn\'t justify her behavior. Let me take an example from this book. Isn\'t tam-tam suffering from PTSD? But the way she treated him? Was that perfectly fine? The point is that this isn\'t only about her PTSD. She wasn\'t suffering from such a thing before going into the Cauldron. If you read ACOTAR from the beginning, you\'ll see what kind of character Nesta was from page 1. If she treated other people suffering from depression like Feyre, Tamlin, oh the way she talks to Lucien then how can anyone even expect that I give her space - when she doesn\'t give that to others?)and just to show her ✨superior powers✨we are constantly told that:• Amren shivered (ohhh scary)• her power ... is death herself (dramatic much?)• Rhysand\'s face grew white (*eye roll*)• Mother save you all (okay but pls shut up with that line)At this point, I am fucking begging SJM on my knees to stop making every single person in her world the epitome of power.and her POV was so boring. IS THIS CHARACTER GROWTH? :’) I could watch the grass grow instead of this. It was so bland after she had mentioned about 1000 times in only the first 200 pages thatshe is angry. Okay we get it. Now stop. But sadly Nesta didn\'t stop. All she could think about was: Cassian\'s cock, how unworthy she is (for his cock),the fire within her wanting to burstttttt or sth. ffs. I have never read a book more redundant than this.We were at the 600+ page mark and still Nesta didn’t change ONE BIT. All her character growth came out of the blue in the last 50 pages which just felt like the dumbest, most miserable attempt at making her seem better (it failed btw).the girl said to Elain:“Spare me the bullshit, please.”I read in a review that Elain didn\'t try to help Nesta. SHE DID. She was there for her. but Ms. Prissy Princess was too into herself to see that. And then she kept raving about Elain choosing Feyre yeah yeah shut up.and she literally said Cassian tastes like crackling embers?? C R A C K L I N G E M B E R S. and then fire roared in her blood and there was an extremely cringey makeout scene after that. Oh, the sex scenes were so cringey, i skipped them whole 😌✊and then there’s Cassian. I used to LIKE Cassian, I LIKED his jokes and attitude.But SJM being SJM turned him from an interesting character into a sex addict. He makes such stupid jokes the entirety of the book, and there is a single thought in his head: his cock. 👏👏👏 he has zero sense, idk why people even like him in this book. I was so sick of reading every two minutes that he wants to fuck Nesta OKAY WE GET IT NOW MOVE ON THINK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. MY GOOD SIR YOU ARE A GENERAL OF AN ARMY OF THE BIGGEST COURT IN PRYTHIAN. DO YOU SERIOUSLY NOT HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO DO?Secondly – the plot that never was:Their world used to be so interesting to me and I don’t gaf what anyone else says, the entire concept of courts and worlds and gahh I loved it and I wanted to know more about it.But instead of discovering more about this world, we spend 700 pages reading Nessian fucking each other in every position instead of discovering more about this world. I WISH the plot was given the attention it needed but sadly – it wasn’t. Basically, everything that happened in the (non-existent) plot was to give Nesta more superpowers *rolls eyes*This is in no way a fantasy, even labeling it as such is an atrocity. NOTHING HAPPENS IN TERMS OF PLOT.Thirdly - Rhysand:And then there\'s the elephant in the room.Rhysand. I cannot for the life of me believe this is the same person from the previous books. If a man treated me the way Rhysand treated the women around him in this book, i would eat him alive. And this is a major statement coming from me since I loved Rhysand to the point of pasting his face all over my house and I spent all my teenage years worshipping on his shrine.SJM gave his character a 180 degree turn from the man we all met and fell in love with in ACOMAF. Is this the same man who helped Feyre heal in ACOMAF? YOU\'RE ACTUALLY TELLING ME THAT RHYSAND WOULD DO THIS TO FEYRE? Do y\'all remember chapter 54 of ACOMAF? Do y\'all remember all the things he did for her? How in seven hells is this the same person?I will never in a million lifetimes forgive SJM for destroying one of my favourite characters. A character i genuinely loved, a character i cried over, a character itrusted- now forever destroyed. RIP Rhysand.And this isn\'t just the problem with Rhysand. SJM made the entire Inner Circle go from people who suffered and were full of empathy for others to these immature childish bastards whose sole purpose is to somehow berate Nesta.Conclusion:Lucien and Azriel are the only good things left in this book, they are my precious babies whom i will protect till the day i die AND IF SOMEONE SAYS ONE BAD THING ABOUT LUCIEN AGAIN, YOU BETTER BELIEVE I WILL RIP THE FABRICS OF THE WORLD TO EAT THAT PERSON ALIVE.I\'ve said it before, i\'ll say it again. Mass is not a bad writer. I love her ToG series (her superior series btw). She\'s good when she wants to be and I just wish she bothered writing ACOSF and writing Nesta’s character and her journey in a more believable way.You can\'t argue with the fact that Nesta is a pretty toxic character whose redeeming qualities came at about page 600+ after doing inexcusable shit the entirety of the book and for me that\'s too late. And then there\'s the matter of everyone around her being so fuckingdisgusting, i don\'t even know who I dislike more.What this world needs is for these 500-year-old hooligans (who haven’t learnt a single thing in their entire millennia of living) to step aside and let ME rule the Night Court (I’d be a better leader than any of them anyway) with Azriel by my side.Let\'s just hope the next book is A HUGE BOOK ABOUT AZRIEL because no one deserves it more than him 😭 Pls SJM give him the book he deserves.------------that cover is 2020 in the flesh'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Spoilers hidden because I’m not a dickThis review gonna be a lili bit of raving about this book by itself VS ranting how it was as a continuation of Maas’s seriesHonestly, my biggest challenge going into this book was all my preconceptions of this world and its characters.The stakes were high.Cassianis one of the biggest favorites in the fandomWhereas Nesta has a reputation for being a....So going into it, the book was better when I tried to block out all the nasty shit in previous books and high expectations.This isn’t the start of a new ✨Maas✨series, just a standalone romance happening in same world.I highly recommend that mindset cuz then it's less disappointing. Moving on,꧁The Characters꧂I have never likedNesta Acheron. sorry not sorry. I didn’t like her much in the previous books but I acknowledge that her character has potential for such depth that Maas really tried to develop here.But did it work?Typically these characters dynamics would usually have me ✨screaming✨with a bloodthirsty heroine and spitfire cocky guy who always comes back for her!!I’ve always loved Cassian. But i didnt*quite*love his POV.I felt like thru an attempt of making his character more dimensional, we lost some of his key characteristics as the flirtatous badasswho uses humor and adrenaline to cope... Yes it was amazing getting insight into his thoughts and Maas’s writing style easily adopted this dual perspective. I just wish we got more of the Cassian that trained Freye and let her punch out as needed while cracking jokes at Rhysands expensive.Maas is known for her growling, purring, overprotective, asshole, alpha males. BUT I LOVEEE ITTTTAnd his relationship with Nesta was so well developed. He knows Nesta as a victim, killer, broken girl, self-sufficient woman, and general badass.He's seen it alll and he keeps coming back for her.Together, these two were the perfect combination fora hot chaotic relationshipthat had you swooning, cackling, and gasping.I don't think Nesta will ever be my fav characterhowever her story really speaks to mental health for someone who reacts/protects themselves with sharp words and angerSome describe Nesta as ambitious and authoritative character but to me she was veryselfish, cold, and distant. She did nothing to help Feyre provide for their family and spent the money Freye earned on frivolous items. THEN in fey world went on whole refusing to train/ help others but demanding they protect ONE of her sisters?!*fuck off*In this book, She*finally*had moments of -well i’m tired of not being able to protect myself. LIKE YES BITCH THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL BEEN SAYING THIS WHOLE TIMESo on that element, I was sooo glad she was actually making progress and decisions!At the same time, I found myself disappointed with the Inner Circle*gasp*I know, I was sad about it too. I understood why they were done with her shit. Because, same.But the constant bashing of Nesta's drinking, sex, and weight were low blows especially compared to the violence and weight loss Freyre went thru. hypocrites much? I fully recognize this isn’t reflective of the characters we knowbut its Nesta’s perspective of the charactersacting towards her...*Shrug*꧁The Maas Quality꧂Honestly, sad to report no major twists. It was just a really good, borderline dark, romance driven by character development and lottttasexy sexy fun timessince its not longer YAIf I had just randomly picked this up, then this book would’ve been off the charts with such dynamic characters, beautiful worldbuilding, and an okay plot.But in comparison with her others, this book seemed kinda basic and was missing some intricate detail plot twists that you usually can count on with Maas.To sum up it was an epic story of redemption-- Of a girl finding herself again after tragedy. And along the way she makes friends, and a lover who listens to her who supports her rough recovery, and not always her actions.Somehow this book felt soooo long and overly descriptive.. but also was not enough. No idea how that happens but there it is.The next threat/enemy makes logical sense. So I liked thatI wanted Nesta to get fierce FOR her sisters and be finally willing to fight FOR them. I lovesome badass sisters dynamicsof teasing each other, bitching at each other but would do anything for each other in the end!Didn't really quite get that.I was constantly underwhelmed by Nesta. She talks lotta shit but what has she actually done?She has continuously refused to show initiative in her own life and failed to provide for herself. Instead, she constantly chose to lean on the resources of others for her survival.All she has done is complain.Complainabout her human life while refusing to work and save herself or her sisters.Complainabout the happiness her lili sister found while refusing to be part of it.Complainabout the only people willing to fight and save humans while refusing to train or learn to fight FOR HERSELF.iM bOrEd and AnGeReD by the dismissive bullshit that defined her character up to this point in the seriesThis book showed some sparks of greatness! Taking initiative in her life! Using all that spitfire and backbone to make something for herself! But in the end, it kinda failed to live up to the fierce powerful Nesta I was hoping she would transform into.Reading this book you can’t help but compare to Maas’ other great heroines.I think the big difference is that Aelin always kept moving forward. And Bryce was a little shit. But Nesta handled her depression by freezing and becomingnasty.Which is just really hard to read sometimes.Overall, I’m glad I read this book but it won’t be a major re-read like most Maas books. The book stands on the friendship the characters build, Nesta overcoming her despair and FINALLY developing her interesting powers. I greatly enjoyed the character dynamics of how Cassian and Nesta are such strong complex characters, but I wanted their romance to be more epic and to sweep me away. I love this world and all the creatures and BADASS FEMALE WARRIORS but the plot was lacking and I hate the power change that a lot of Maas’ characters are undergoing.If you are teetering whether to read this book, I gotta tell you to lower your expectations and try to forget the bullshit of Nesta’s past in order to just fully enjoy this book. It was pretty great seeing the Inner Circle’s relationships in the aftermath of Wings and Ruin, especially through Nesta’s harsh eye that hardcore READS THESE BITCHES and all their flaws. Plus it gives some foreshadowing and builds excitement for which characters might be next.It was a good romance, but it wasn’t a great Maas book.ALSO I’M STIL FRIGGEN PISSED ABOUT THAT COVER-------------------------------------------------------------------------Pre-Book thoughtsI have never likedNesta.sorry not sorry. I didn’t like her much in the previous books but I acknowledge that her character does have potential for such depthSome describe Nesta as ambitious and authoritative character but to me she was veryselfish, cold, and distant. She did nothing to help Feyre provide for their family and spent the money Freye earned on frivolous items. THEN in fey world goes on whole refusing to train/ help others but demanding they protect ONE of her sisters?!*fuck off*Just the idea of a sister knowingly fucking over another in how she treated Freyre as human for YEARS ... it actually hurts my heart a little bit .... that kinda selfishnessBut Cassian liking her will probably MAKE me like her more*god i hope so cuz he deserves the best*I just sick of Nesta's unrelenting nastiness while also hoping she resolves her trauma and that Cassian finds the happiness he deservesWish listIt’d be kinda cool to find out that she was doing something—sacrificing—to help the familythat Freyre never knewback when they were humans behind the wallShe just needsSOME redeeming qualityfor all the times she constantly bitching and lashing out at everyone. Some reason for why the whole Cassian ignoring thing and treating her sis Feyre like dirt*shaking my fucking head*Also generally she way 2 protective and angry towards people for there not to be some sorta backstory or event behind it hahahCover:ehhh I not really a fan of this style... also don’t think it really suited for Cassian with the hardcore Autumn court theme and colors. This just seems like such a let-down and step-down compared to the artful creativity and beauty of Crescent City*frowny face*But its Maas so of courseeeee imma read it*duhhhh*""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""EDIT: this kind of blew up so I just wanted to say that if you're one of those people writing essays in the comment section to try to change my mind: I don't care lol 😭 good for you for being passionate about something but I'm not here to read a think piece on why you disagree, stream red velvet tho xThe following will contain major spoilers.Nobody is surprised. I knew absolutely nothing would make this book good, save SJM deciding not to write it altogether.Now, I have to make it clear upfront: IloveNesta. I really resonate with the way that she deals with her own emotions and is consequently treated by the people around her. That being said, I loathe SJM’s books. I only begrudgingly pushed through this for Nesta, and even that wasn’t worth it.Nothingcould have made this worth it.I’m not here to give a criticism of the plot or politics, because I’m sure nobody cares (I don’t). I’m also not here to judge the sex aspect of this book, although I know many people have chosen to critique that. Instead, I’d like to cover the three cardinal sins this book committed:respect, rebirth, and rhysand.RespectACOSF starts off with our heroine using drinking and sex as her coping mechanism. The third book in the ACOTAR trilogy left our main characters, especially Nesta, heavily traumatized. She witnessed her good-for-nothing father come back after he didnothingfor her or her sisters as children and try to fight Hybern. She watches as he dies in front of her. She watches as thousands of Illyrian soldiers die. She watches as Cassian is nearly killed multiple times in front of her. She’s underweight, depressed, has PTSD, and gets shit all because of it.No, in fact, she’spunishedfor it.The straw that broke the camels back is the fact that she spent 500 gold on beer and gambling. Now, the problem isn’t that she drank or gambled. It’s that she used this money-which is HILARIOUS considering that Rhysand owns five houses and pays each Inner circle member a salary that is so grotesquely huge it’s described in previous books as being more than they’ll ever need in their lifetimes. Rhysand is even completely fine with the fact that Velaris is full of so-called “slums” but oh, no, NESTA can’t be living in one! It’s fine if poor people exist, she’s just not allowed to be one of them because it’s “embarrassing” to them. Obviously, they cut her off completely, DESTROYED the entire neighborhood she lived in (has anyone wondered what the fuck happened to the other people living there lmao? are they just homeless now?), and ship her off to a sexist, homophobic war camp with the one person she doesn’t want to be around because being depressed is just /such/ a sin.She is repeatedly berated by every member in the court. Some lovely examples:>Cassian tells her that everyone “fucking hates (her)” and later makes this out to be “oh, I just said that but I didn’t really mean it.”>During one of their sex scenes she asks him if his friends won’t be angry with him for sleeping with her because she’s so aware of the fact that they hate her.>“Perhaps you can find it in yourself to try a little harder this year.”>He jokes that she might order him to kill himself, and she asks him if he really thinks she’s capable of that. Because this entire time they’ve made her feel like sheisa monster.>Mor tells her that she “never deserved the benefit of the doubt that good people like (Cassian) give her” and also says that she should be thrown into the court of nightmares. For anyone unaware, the court of nightmares is where her homophobic and abusive family is.>Amren constantly makes fun of her appearance and berates her for having sex. She tells her she looks awful at every opportunity, and always chalks it up to be because she sleeps around and drinks too much.>Rhysand gets his own section for abhorrent comments.There is no end to it. Every chapter brought a character insulting her for justexisting.Her weight problems are described fucking atrociously. The first time Cassian even sees her in the book he comments on how she’s “skin and bones” but guys, he still wants to tap that. Every time her weight is mentioned is either to insult her for starving herself because, need I remind you, she’s DEPRESSED, or it’s for Cassian to point out while he talks about how hot she is.All of this. All 768 pages of insult after insult after humiliation and pointless paragraphs forNestato apologize tothem.Because it’s /her/ fault she’s depressed. It’s /her/ fault she has PTSD. It’s /her/ fault and she needs to change for everyone else. Because everyone forced her to leave against her will because theylovedher, something they make sure to remind her of every single damn chapter. Nesta is disrespected by everyone throughout the entire book and is rewarded for it by being the one who must respect them instead.RebirthYou have no idea how excited I was back when I was an ACOTAR fan and Nesta was rebirthed as a High Fae and got her powers from the cauldron. It was like watching someone so similar to me-someone who was mean, and opinionated, andboldhold all the power in the world. I wanted to see how SJM would write her journey of becoming physically and mentally strong-of mastering her powers.We see glimpses of it. How her eyes shine with fire. How she sears the stairs she walks on with a single finger. The light emanating from her. The way she is single-handedly more powerful than Rhysand, who was said to be the strongest High Lord. It was incredible.And then she gave it all up.That’s it. Journey’s over. She gave up all of the power she had, but not before using it to mutate her pelvis so that she would be able to birth an Illyrian baby without dying.Yeah. That’s all.RhysandI have never met a character whom I loathe more than Rhysand. Perfect, feminist king Rhysand who loves giving women a choice so long as they pick the one he wants them to. He’s the most worthless, pathetic, egomaniac asshole I’ve ever read about. His name is mentioned 791 times, which is 791 times too many.It’s made very clear from the get-go that he hates Nesta. He’s aggressive toward her in a way that makes me want to strangle him every time he speaks. Every comment toward her or about her is an ill-intended remark.Nesta makes what he knows of him clear early on: “Any offering Rhysand threw her way was solely out of love for Feyre.”Wait for it, things are about to get comedic.When Nesta finds out about Feyre’s pregnancy, Rhysand looks at her threateningly, because of course he thinks she’s a danger to his kid. It says, “Rhysand was not only male, but a Fae male, and he would eliminate any threats to his mate and child.”Here comes the funny part—Absolutely hilarious to me that Rhysand wants to be the white vanilla king who loves women (and is definitely not misogynistic) and his wife SO MUCH that he hid from her the fact that her giving birth could potentially kill her.Oh yeah!Because wanting to protect your mate (gag) involves lying to her about her own body and child. He strictly forbids anyone tells her about it, so, naturally, Nesta tells her.Now, I’m not going to sit here and pretend like she had good intentions. She was just doing it to be an ass. But at least she told the god damn woman that the kid inside of her was going to KILL HER! And then, Feminist king Rhysand declared, and-I-quote, “Get Nesta out of this city. Right now. Before I fucking kill her.”Round of applause for our cracker saltine lord ruler Rhyse Hall, everybody.I have no other words. No words for how every single time Nesta dared to stand up to the awful way she was treated by him Cassian would get angry ather.As if Rhys was some infallible God who could do no wrong and must never be criticized. No matter how large his wrongdoing was, it was always her fault. Always her who was the problem.I just feel like...I don't know. I like Cassian, or I did, at least. I think that a good love interest should both support the heroine and call her out when she's being a dick, but relentlessly siding against her is just so ??? What's even the point? His entire family hates her guts, and he doesn't do much to make her think otherwise or to comfort her about it. He definitely doesn't act like he doesn't share some of their views. I don't see how a male lead placing his family over his girl could be very romantic?Concluding thoughts and my 13th reasonThis is the worst book Sarah J Maas has ever written, and that’s saying a lot. From her worthless white feminism to the complete and utter mind-numbing torture I had to face through this Bible-length tome, I could not have thought of a worse thing to read. It’s sad because I truly love Nesta Archeron so much, but this book made it evident that Sarah Janet hates her and wants to give her the worst story ever. Also, Feysand baby had a stupid name. SorryEDIT:frequently asked questions so that you can stop asking them:Why would you read something you know you'll hate?It's a free country! Why did you read this entire review if you knew you would hate it? (Yes, I /am/ a miserable person. I enjoy writing hate reviews. I think it's funny)It's a fiction book, it doesn't need to be realistic.By mistreating mental illness and eating disorders in fiction you perpetuate the idea in real life. The thing is, writing about something is not an endorsement, but neither is it a condemnation. SJM could have written about these situations in a way that was respectful, but, at least in my opinion, she completely missed the mark. I'm not saying she shouldn't have written about Nesta's mental health and weight issues. I'm saying that the way she wrote about them made it seem like they were just...her fault? Do you know what I mean? Like, as someone who has received comments about my weight many times, I felt deeply uncomfortable by how people treated her.If that's what you think then what do you think about... (enter character/ship I didn't mention)?I like Gwen? I don't have any further thoughts.Do you think having mental illness excuses someone to be a bad person?Mental illness is an explanation, not an excuse. It /explains/ why Nesta wants to be left alone. It /explains/ why she has a hard time being around anyone in the Inner Circle. It /explains/ her complicated feelings toward them. Nesta was already a mean person before this book—the actual question is whether or not any of her rude behaviorneedsto be excused in the first place. And that's for you to think on. Personally, I don't care.What Red Velvet song?All of them!""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5 - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️It feels like coming home after a long journey.That is precisely what I feel whenever I read aSarah J Maasbook. WhileThrone of Glassis my favorite series butACOTARis special to me. It helped me during one of the most difficult periods of my life and in particular,ACOMAF.I have no words to describe the beautiful familiarity of returning to a world you know you have always missed.I swear I could almost feel the gentle breeze of Velaris caressing me, welcoming me back while knowing that the story will start from a very dark place.Because this isNesta\'sstory.In the beginningAnd in the endThere was DarknessAnd nothing more.I will be writing two sections of the review soon:• a non-spoiler section that will come first• a spoiler section because I DO need to highlight some points.----------Non-spoiler review----------Nesta\'shealing journey was not a smooth one. I did not expect it to be. She clawed her way out of the the darkness that engulfed her ever since she had turned into a Fae.For her to heal, Nesta had to rip her soul apart to find her self again.I will tell you that I disliked Nesta so much in the ACOTAR books, I just kept a tight hold on the grudge against her.But Nesta is not a person that was meant to be liked. She is vicious and her sharpest weapon has always been her tongue. She could inflict a wound so deep with a mere word. But I came to realizeNesta is the most ""human"" character among all of them.Humanity does not equal good morals necessarily, Nesta is heavily flawed and her flaws are what makes her human.She is guilt-ridden to the point she allows her guilt to rot within her, poisoning most of the traits that makes her a good person. She carries such a deep disdain towards herself that she acts on it and you often see it in the form of lashing words.Why does she allow this to happen to her? Because she holds onto one belief:She deserves it.When I started seeing Nesta\'s soul more clearly after she began to tear it open, I felt my soul resonate with hers to the point that I cried.She was a prisoner in her own head, reliving certain deaths and nightmares that she can no longer see the light in the world. She can no longer see the goodness in her.It was powerful. It was raw. It was ugly.It was devastatingly beautiful in a way.That is what Nesta\'s healing looked like. She was such a damaged person inside that she gave up on the hope of healing herself.Does that mean all is forgotten about Nesta\'s past behavior? About the fact that she hurt and wronged many people? That she at many moments was a horrid person?The answer is No, and this is what makes Nesta\'s healing journey so impactful and emotional.Her trauma after the Cauldron and the War wrapped its adamant chains around her. The devastating war still haunts her and pulls her back from that light at the end of the tunnel where her family await her, a family that are bent on believing that she chose to remain in the darkness.No one was willing to go deep into the darkness to her and gift her a fragment of light that will guide her steps out.No one was willing to go as far as to shatter those chains and spare her from that misery.No one except forCassian.Nesta and Cassian\'s romance was maddening, passionate and wild.They were feral with each other, they were mad for one another, they were perfect for each other. I expected no less of them.Sarah J Maaswas not kidding when she mentioned that this was the filthiest book she has written so far.I was very impressed with her writing style, I really enjoy seeing an author\'s journey throughout the years and how much they grow. Of course, ACOSF comes with its own set of flaws and issues but it does not ruin the overall experience for me.If it shredded my emotions, if it made me cry, if my heart felt attached to this world after turning the very last page. It deserves a 5-star rating from me regardless of the issues and flaws that I will highlight in the spoiler section.Not to mention now that I adore Nesta, I adore the person she had become in the end and this is coming from a person that never liked her in the previous books.A Court of Silver Flamesis sexy, emotionally gripping and powerful.WARNINGI will go into detail about the book in the other section of this review below which will contain MAJOR SPOILERS, so please this is a heads up for those that have not read the books to not continue further unless they are willing to be spoiled.--------MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD--------Spoiler-review:The following review will be summed up in points because this is the best way to sort my thoughts and make sure I left nothing out.Yes people I am about to let it all out.Also, this is my own experience and my opinion should not be treated as a fact. To each of us their own unique reading experiences. I do not want to ruin anyone\'s experience and I do not want someone to ruin mine.So, let\'s get on with it!*ACOSF\'sbackbone wasNestaand her found family:Gwyn and Emerie. I adore their precious bond and the fact that they are badass female characters whom are also passionate readers of smutty romances. I love that Nesta found other friends outside the IC, they all found something in each other and helped one another heal.* TheHouseis my new favorite character.* Unpopular opinion but I am glad to seeRhysandplaying the High Lord role. Of course we\'d find him to be more broody since we are no longer seeing him fromFeyre\'sperspective, we are seeing him in his true element. I\'ve noticed that a few readers said they didn\'t like Rhys in this book, well.. Rhysand isn\'t the epitome of perfection many make him out to be and I appreciate that because he is heavily flawed too and yes I do like Rhysand.* My heart bursts with so much love forCassian! He wasn\'t without flaws too but I finally saw the raw version of him.* Although I was in no rush to seeFeyre\'spregnancy, yet it warmed my heart because Feyre deserves that kind of happiness after everything she went through. Of course I cried when she announced that she was pregnant I already suspected it early on.* It\'s refreshing to see theInner Circlefrom two other perspectives especially Nesta\'s and their treatment of her as if she was a hopeless case. Not saying that Nesta wasn\'t at fault here but they too are not cutting her some slack.* I think in regards to theromanceI have a few things I want to address: there were some romantic scenes that felt repetitive from ACOMAF + the intimate scenes were sometimes spicy in a good way and sometimes sloppy with weird descriptions.* I loved seeingNesta\'sgrowth because it was beautiful and ugly at the same time and you can easily notice the shifting points in her healing.* I rolled my eyes at theNessianmating bond, sorry everyone. I let it slip because I grew fond of them both but I do not want the romance to always be attached to some invisible bond. It\'s supposed to be rare we already had that with Rhys and Feyre.* Theplotdid not feel stable, it felt like it went to so many different directions. I was kind of hoping there would be more politics and human queens involved but it\'s not like I wasn\'t happy to where it ended up.* I was missing the open-conversation I was looking forward to between Nesta and the Inner Circle, both acknowledging their wrongs.* The rareRed starblasting through the sky that rattled Rhys, freaked out Cassian and the Priesstesses is none other thanAelin!.* Can we talk about the fact thatHelionwanted to enter the Night Court in a Golden Chariot led by four white horses with manes of golden fire and Rhys was like no so he settled for a Pegasus still having the best entrance of any character in the book.* the whole High King situation is a big No No. I love the dynamic of the Seasonal and Solar Courts and that what makes Prythian unique. Making Rhys a High King would ruin that and the fact that each Court is associated with its High Lord\'s power. I\'ve had it with Rhys beingthe most powerful high lord in historyso I do not need him to be upgraded to a High King especially not with using weapons that are the products of Nesta\'s power. That\'s giving Rhys way more power.* The scene that hit me the most was when Nesta let it all out. I cried because I am familiar with that level of self-loath.* I cried at the scene when Feyre was giving birth, it was intense and so emotional. Deep down I knew SJM wouldn\'t just end it here but it did not stop my heart from breaking.* The aftermath was so precious.* I do not mind thatNestalost the power she took from the Cauldron. She will lead the Valkyries whom she revived with her two other friends. She will grow even stronger without relying on powerful magic that makes her a target of other enemies. Her power has been a heavy weight lifted off her shoulders, and she gave them away in the most emotional and beautiful way.* Unpopular opinion: I have no issues withAzriel\'s POVbecause this is the first time we are exposed to his thoughts and he definitely was not OOC. Azriel is not some dark cinnamon roll, he is a deep inner turmoil. I find his notion of love and thoughts of Elain to be unhealthy. He has no experience with love besides the 500 year old unrequited love for Mor which brings me to ask... how come Az would get over Mor, his 500 year old crush just for Elain? They have not even spoken about their feelings. Anyhow, I do believe Azriel to be at a very dark place and it saddens me that many readers disliked him after this. Azriel has always kept to himself, he was never brought into the light, he does not know what love truly is. Having an Archeron sister does not guarantee the happiness his brothers found, this is a very wrong mindset.* Yes, I\'ve said it before and I\'ll say it again:Azrielneeds a ray of sunshine kind of character and we find that inGwyn. I think she is perfect for him and there is a reason SJM gave her the spotlight in his POV. Her name literally means happiness, blessing, white, fair while Az\'s is God is my help and Azrael the Angel of Death. Such a stark contrast, like yin and yang.* I hope SJM won\'t useGwyn, a SA survivor, as a plot-device for Elriel and then discard her that is too cruel.* Yes, not all Illyrian brothers should end up with every Archeron sister so I\'ll be rooting for Azriel and Gwyn in the next book.* Also, many people calledRhysa hypocrite for his actions with Azriel. No, what he did makes sense and he is pulling rank because this is how Rhys asserts his role as High Lord with a responsibility toward his court. Az ignored the Mor question, Az did not express his love or feelings towards Elain only his desire to have her and I\'m pretty sure there would\'ve been a different reaction from Rhys if Az told him that he genuinely loves her. With a baby on the way, Rhys won\'t risk any more conflicts that targets him and his family nor will he risk alliances with the other courts because of Azriel. How many times throughout the books did Rhys ask something of Azriel like to stop spying or not engage in a battle and he refuses until Rhys pulls the High Lord act on him and tells him that\'s it\'s anorder, people forget how stubborn Azriel can be.* I appreciate the fact that this book gave us a new perspective to theInner Circleand their flaws. I still adore them.I may add points later on, I\'m not quite sure I covered everything but I hope I did.Another note I would add is please be careful with posting spoilers in the comments. Try to be vague about it because it will still show on Goodreads feed to other readers that haven\'t read the book.Remember that this is my own personal experience of the book and my own personal opinions that in no way invalidate your own, so please do not invalidate mine if you do not agree with it.ACOMAF remains at the top but ACOSF managed to take over the second place, I will definitely be rereading it some time in the future.This is the longest review I have written so far, so thank you for sticking around.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '*This review contains no spoilers.*(very scared and had to edit my review after i pressed control + f and saw how many times i used the word ""fuck""). i have grammatically de-fucked this review. enjoy.)Ranting and RavingLet\'s get one thing clear: I am a hard core SJM fan. I have read and loved every book this woman has ever written. But can I be real a second? This book was shit, and I hated everything.CharactersI hatedevery single personin this book. Well, except Azriel (he can have me any day). But everyone else can die.I don\'t understand how you can make a fantastic, wonderful trilogy about love, friendship, healing, and everything beautiful in this world, and then come out with a disgusting, trashy, smutty ""romance"" that has absolutely no plot, shitty character growth,and an overall shitty book.Not to mention the cover. What is that, anyway??? An orange mask? A tiger?SJM took her perfectly developed characters and pretty much just let them rot. From the first three books, I loved every single person. Everyone. Now I hate Feyre. I hate Rhysand. I hate Cassian. I hate Amren. I hate Mor. For ** sake, IdespiseElain. Why is she a character? Why does sheexist? What does she add to the book? What role does she play, other than to collect people’s sympathy and make them feel sorry for her? I’m sorry (not), butElain is a ** idiot.I cannot STAND this hoe. Sarah, please write her death. I can\'t deal with her constant whining and bitching, running to Rhys and Cassian and telling them she wants to go back to the human world, just because of Nasty Nesta. Elain, you\'ve been living with your sister your entire life, and you choosenowto complain about how much of a bitch she is? Where were you the past eighteen years? Please, sweetie, grow a spine.I loved Feyre and Rhysso much(note *past tense*). I would\'ve done anything for them. Now I despise them with every atom in my body. The entire book is just themfucking, and Rhys bragging to Cassian that they’re fucking. And nowFeyre and Rhys have a childand now my life is over. I hated this book. I hated everything. No way I\'ve already mentioned that.On to the next bitch of the month: Cassian. Why the ** do I hate Cassian now (who I ADORED in ACOTAR)? For a simple question, there\'s an equally simple answer. Mostly because Cassian doesn\'t know how to keep his ((())) in his pants, and all he can think about is Nesta sUcKinG it and fUckInG it and doing whatever kinky shit they did that I can\'t even mention with a straight face. I hate you, Cassian. Ihateyou. Get me characters whose livesdon\'trevolve around their OTP and who think about thingsotherthan fucking, bucking and yucking the love of their life. Which—not to mention—Cassian and Nesta don\'t even seem to love each other. It\'s all about the rElEaSe for them, because apparently, these fictional bitches have so much sexual tension that they can\'t help rubbing up on each other every twenty ** pages. Bye. Every one of you nasty lil bitches disgust me.Wait, you\'restillnot done talking about the shitty characters? No bitch I\'m really not, because I\'m so angry at how many trees died for this pathetic book.The next shitty character I’ll be talking about is none other than Amren the hoe and Mor the bird. I honestly feel a little bad talking shit about them just because I adored them so much in the trilogy, but this shit has got to betalkedabout!Heads-up to all those authors out there: when you are describing a character and how pOwErFuL they are, please. please.pleasedo not get other powerful characters to ""shiver"" or ""pale"" when they are around the character you want to MAKE powerful. It is the cringiest thing I have ever read in my life. It’s so painful. Come up with some unique way to describe their power and make readers admire them, NOT get powerful characters like Amren to ""shiver"" and Rhys to ""pale"" when they are around Nesta. I don\'t necessarilyhateMor and Amren, but they’ve become so ** irrelevant in the fourth book that there\'s really no point talking about them anymore.Character ArcThe character growth in this book actually made me laugh. It was so minimal that it was astonishing. It was just Nesta apologizing to everyone because she realized everyone ** hated her guts and she had no one to go to. How can apologies possibly show character growth? I agree, Nesta\'s bitchy behavior throughout the book was inexcusable. However, that was why I liked her.It would\'ve been better if she continued being the bitchy little shit she was, but rushing her character growth towards the last 100 pages is stupid and inexcusable and straight up lazy, and it was a complete waste of my time.Love InterestNow let\'s get into why the ** I hate Rhysand\'s guts. Mind you, I used to love this hoe. I would’ve died for him. Now? I’m just glad I was never faced with that decision. If I was in Prythian, I would rather breathe raid smoke than the same air as him.First, Rhys is the only form of character growth in this entire book. I\'m sorry, did I say character growth? I meant characterdepletion. Rhysand has accomplished it, y\'all. He has accomplished his Unbecoming. Where was that sweet, kind, playful man that helped heal Feyre and helped her and everyone around him? Where the ** did he go, because I sure couldn\'t find him.Throughout the book he also brags to Cassian about fucking Feyre nonstop. You have sentences like:""\'Feyre initiated this round.\' Cassian could hear the pure male satisfaction in Rhys\' voice as he said it.""""I dismissed the maids bc I don\'t want them hearing what we\'re up to.""Cassian, laughing: ""Give the poor female a break""Rhysand: ""We\'re taking a break.For now."" (Did this bitch really just sayfor now?)But really though, why the FUCK is this necessary? Does Sarah J. Maas think it\'s attractive for a male to talk about his partner like that? What has she done to perfectly amazing characters? I am confusion? And disappointment? Now he is an egotistical jerk, a typical overprotective alpha male (*coughs* did someone say Rowan? - I despised him in EoS), and a ** shitty ass friend.I wouldn\'t go so far to say that ACOTAR was one of my favorite fantasy series ever, but it was definitely up there. Now, it is down there. I don\'t ever want to read about these thirsty whores ever again.PlotHold up, there was a ** plot? Unfortunately, there was nothing in this book resembling anything of the sort. There was no plot whatsoever, to the point that there weren\'t even any plot holes. In order to have plot holes, you must havesomesemblance of a plot. I was justwaitingfor some crazy SJM shit to go down, for her to pull some astonishing bullshit on us, for some hoe to declare war on another hoe. But then the book just ended. And I was confused. I didn\'t understand. I thought someone had ripped the last 200 pages from the back of my book. Alas, it was not my book\'s fault. It was the author\'s.Additional PointsI woke up at 9:38 AM to write this hateful review because the hate is overwhelming. I wanted to die reading this. Nesta is oh-so-powerful because her power is ""pure death,"" as Rhys puts it. I couldn\'t stand this. The only person that was tolerable in the slightest was Azriel, who I would probably marry. But everyone else in this book has turned shitty and disgusting. The other character who Isort oflike is Nesta, who everyone says is a selfish bitch, but that\'s really the only reason why I like(d) her.I was going to reread ACOMAF and the rest of that damn series before I started this book, but now I can\'t even bring myself to, because then I\'ll just end up remembering the utter failure that was ACOSF. I\'m not putting up with these characters anymore. Y\'all can all die and I would laugh. Which is certainly a surprise, since I balled my eyes out when I thought Rhys was dead in ACOWAR. Now Imyselfwould brandish the knife on him. I’d gladly throw him in that ** cauldron while cackling and sit there watching that bitch burn (that sounds really evil and i should delete this sentence but i won’t because i’m feeling resentful and bitter)Overall, i you\'re looking for a book with some steamy, smutty romance, then by all means, this might end up being your favorite book! But for those of us who have brains and who are sensible human beings and actually likecontentin a book, with likable characters, a plot driven story ... go home. Get your money back. Don\'t even get yourself hype for this book. I walked down that path, and honestly, there is no going back.And trust me, I know how popular SJM is. I can\'t scroll through the GR homepage without seeing some unsuspecting victim starting ACOSF. People probably won\'t stop talking about it for the next few months, which is unfortunate, because it\'s trash. I genuinely feel like this dumb shit is overshadowing some really top-tier books, so I\'m going to redirect y\'all to my favorite series of all time,An Ember in the Ashes. Read all four books, it\'ll do you some good, especially after shit like ACOSF fucks with your sanity. AEITA will put this trashy, slutty book to shameful tears.-1,000 starsCheck out my new blog'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '1 STAR.Nesta Acheron is the only interesting character that SJM has ever managed to write and yet she was treated like complete and utter shit throughout this whole book.THIS IS NOT A REVIEW OF THE STORY BUT INSTEAD A DISCUSSION OF SJM’S HORRIBLE “FEMINISM” AND HOW SHE DID NESTA ARCHERON DIRTY.SPOILERS BELOW.I knew before even starting this book that I would dislike the journey that SJM had obviously planned for Nesta but I elected to power through because I genuinely liked Nesta’s character and she resonated with me on a personal level. I shouldn’t have.Within the first few chapters of this book, I was already infuriated beyond belief. Not even 20 pages into the damned thing and we have Cassian, who is worried about thin and unhealthy Nesta has gotten when he suddenly goes off on a mental tangent about her “magnificent breasts”. What the fuck? Unfortunately for us all, this is not even the worst thing to happen to Nesta in the first chapter. We are immediately greeted with Nesta being furiously slut-shamed by her once-friend Amren and our captain feminist Rhysand agrees.“ “Though I bet it’s hard to look good,” Amren went on, “when you’re out until the darkest hours of the night, drinking yourself stupid and fucking anything that comes your way.” … Rhys seemed inclined to agree with Amren. “It seems Rhysand, who is famous for always LETTING women have a choice, does not agree when it comes to women he doesn’t like. Furthermore, Amren’s blatant slut-shaming is brushed off;“ - did Nesta notice the faint glimmer of worry in Amren’s smoky eyes-understand how rare it was? ”Who literally gives a shit. I don’t care if this is the first time Amren has ever been concerned for someone, you don’t say that type of shit to your supposed friend.Poor Nesta is then evicted from her home and ordered into doing what Feyre and Captain Feminist Rhysand want or she will be forced into the human world where she has no place and would be shunned. Some sister, huh? Not only this but Feyre and Rhysand take it upon themselves to tear down a whole block of APARTMENTS where PEOPLE LIVE just because they don’t like that Nesta stays there. SJM has not even tried to stop her privilege from seeping through her characters and if I didn’t already loathe Rhysand I would most definitely be leading the mob to his door at this point. And so Nesta is forced to obey Mr “You always have a choice” Rhysand and attend training with Cassian.We’ll skip a few chapters; Cassian whines and lusts and does a remarkable performance as a “Nice Guy” tm until Nesta insults his precious perfect High Lord and he tells that her everybody hates her. Everybody. Now, it’s remarkably obvious to even the characters in this god forsaken story that Nesta has been struggling after the war (after all it was the supposed reason they sent her away) and yet dear old Cassian gets upset that Nesta doesn’t like his bitch of a High Lord and tells her that everyone hates her. Everyone, you can assume, includes her sisters and himself. This gets resolved in typical SJM style with a “I didn’t mean it, I was angry” apology that is literally faker than me in my online lectures.We move on to some sort of conflict and Rhysand and Co. decide to “ask” Nesta to do something incredibly dangerous, the last time she had done it resulted in the capture of her younger sister Elain. Of course, Nesta doesn’t exactly want to do that and so our quirky inner circle quickly remind her that her aforementioned sister can do instead. The sister that Nesta would die to protect, that one? Yeah. And so, our lovely little Nesta is once more forced into doing what President Feminist wants because her only other option is to sacrifice her sister’s safety. But yeah, you always have a choice, right?Speaking of choices… time for the big one.It’s revealed to us that our darling couple Feysand are with child, cue cheers! Except, the baby has wings and giving birth to him will probably kill Feyre. Rhysand obviously goes around and makes everyone swear not to tell Feyre for… reasons? Captain Choice not telling his wife, mate whatever, that the child she’s carrying will pretty much kill her? Feminism.Now, this stays a secret for a while until Nesta finds out that the glamorous Inner Circle have been discussing her and taking votes on what is or isn’t essential for her to know about her own powers. So, Nesta’s pissed (as she very well should be) and has a confrontation that leads to her telling Feyre the truth about her little fae baby. Shock horror, Rhysand isn’t pleased. In fact, I believe his exact words were:“Get Nesta out of this city. Right now … Before I fucking kill her.”Charmer.Sure, Nesta only told Feyre the truth because she was angry and wanted to hurt her, but I hardly think Nesta is the villain in this situation. Yet she’s treated like one by everyone except Feyre (this is perhaps the only time Feyre has shown some sense). Not only that, Rhysand literally threatens to kill her. When I tell you, I had to put this book down because I was SO INFURIATED, I could barely breathe. If a man ever did that shit to me, he’d be dead in a ditch. But unsurprisingly, SJM pins the blame on Nesta.When I tell you, I could rant about SJM’s purported “feminism” for hours I am not lying. This review could go on for another 20 pages if I wanted to. However, spending that much energy on SJM would be a new low, even for me. So, a wrap-up.A Court of Silver Flames is potentially the worst book I have ever read, especially in terms of character development. We start with Nesta, traumatised and lashing out, and what do we finish with? A Nesta who had to go and beg for everyone’s forgiveness and nobody, not once, apologised to her despite everything I’ve just discussed. I think maybe Feyre apologised once and Rhysand buys her dresses at the end like … are you SHITTING me?!Throughout this story, Nesta finds her own little group of friends and this is probably the only good thing about this stupid fucking book. Nesta’s friendship with two other women was surprisingly heart-warming at times and perhaps the only thing SJM did not screw up completely.This book was a complete and utter fucking monstrosity and I sincerely hope SJM never writes another book again.Fuck you,Allana'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4.25 stars“So Nesta had become a wolf. Armed herself with invisible teeth and claws, and learned to strike faster, deeper, more lethally. Had relished it. But when the time came to put away the wolf, she\'d found it had devoured her too.”I am irrationally annoyed by how much I enjoyed this.I read the reviews and was prepared to snicker my way through the purring, the ridiculous sex scenes, and constant assertions of ""my mate."" However *sigh* this series just does something to my cold cynical heart. I laugh at it, but I am incapable of hating it.So take my hand, lovelies. Let us venture into my detailed thoughts, which I have thoughtfully assembled into a list with no discernible pattern or theme:-Nesta is so bitchy sometimes. I get that it\'s complex and there\'s a certain feminism in portraying someone like her as a protagonist instead of a villain, but jeez, girl. Learn some basic manners. I occasionally wonder if SJM went too far in making Nesta the selfish stepsister in ACOTAR. It\'s hard to shake off that image. She does attempt to justify it in this book by explaining that Nesta was angry at her father for giving up and not providing for his daughters. Nesta was ready to let them all starve to prove a point-Rhys says to Nesta, “Of course you have a choice. You always have a choice here,” like he didn’t force Nesta out of her flat, force her to live in one of his residences where she can\'t leave, force her to train with Cassian, force her to work at the library, etc. Surely there are better ways to stage an intervention. I know they did it out of love, but Tamlin did what he did out of love, too-Speaking of, everyone hates Tamlin because he gave Nesta and Elain to the King of Hybern (which he did to save Feyre), but when Rhys threatens to kill Nesta if she hurts Feyre, that’s somehow okay.Nesta literally had to flee for her life after telling Feyre the truth about her pregnancy-Rhys and Feyre are supposedly equals, but he refuses to tell Feyre about the dangers of her pregnancy. Nesta is portrayed as the bad guy for telling her sister the truth-Can we stop worshiping Rhys now? Please?-I like that Nesta asks Cassian how he likes his blowjob. It normalizes communication during sex-SJM is too lazy to think of actual names for magical places and items. Under The Mountain sounds ominous if you think about it, but then there’s the Harp, the Mask, and the Crown-Ireally liked Nesta\'s character arc: her struggle with trauma and depression, her cold rage at her father for refusing to provide for them and the steel pride that prevents her for apologizing to Feyre for her past behavior, the self-loathing and insecurity, the female solidarity with other victims of sexual assault and misogyny. On that last note, I\'ve never understood why Nesta and Elain were so upset with being being transformed into beautiful, powerful High Fae back during ACOWAR. SJM explains it more by linking the violent act of being forced inside the Cauldron and changed against her will with rape/sexual assault.-While I adore the themes mentioned above, SJM writes the same arc over and over. All of her female protagonists (Aelin, Feyre, that girl from House of Earth and Blood) wrestle with crippling depression at some point. She recycles plots and characters and writing phrases. Gets pretty old-The ending is thematically confusing.Nesta and her friends are thrown into the Illyrian Rite of Passage thing, which has traditionally forbidden female warriors because sexism. They get through it together without magic, symbolically smashing the patriarchy. This ties in with all the themes ACOSF has been pushing.Feyre\'s childbirth near the end is where it gets confusing. Both Feyre and her kid die, but Nesta saves them by stopping time and bargaining with Death (or the Cauldron, can\'t remember). She alters the shape of Feyre\'s pelvis so a kid with wings can pass through and transforms hers as well for her far-off future kid with Cassian. In exchange, Nesta gives up some of the power she took from the Cauldron, but gets to keep a little because God forbid a SJM character is anything less than overpowered.Thematically, the childbirth scene doesn\'t make sense in terms of the book\'s overall plot. What is the implication? That women have to sacrifice power in order to have kids? That doesn\'t fit the whole feminist angle.Maybe the scene can be interpreted as Nesta finally repairing her bond with Feyre? ASOSF has seen Nesta feeling disconnected from her family (guilt over her dead father, anger towards Elaine for supposedly turning her back on her, both rage and guilt regarding Feyre). Here, Nesta is restoring family by saving her sister and nephew\'s lives. She communes with the Mother, the harbringer of life. It contrasts her power of death, which is connected to her feelings of rage and desolation. Nesta believes she is too prickly to love, but through her hand (and better mental health), life blooms.That\'s a better interpretation than SJM had a baby in real life and wanted to work in motherhood somewhere. Also, Feyre has been resurrected twice now.

Rhys and Feyre are annoying to me because they are perfect and have no flaws and that's boring. I literally could not care less about any of the other characters besides Nesta, Cassian, and Azriel. SJM also uses repetitive language, and I swear she gets paid per ellipsis. There are many things I don't like about these books.But dang it, are they entertaining! And I would be lying if I didn't say that I shipped Cassian and Nesta like I never have anyone before!I was so ready for this ship to sail. And now that it has, I gotta say, I'm disappointed. I wantedmore. I can't even tell you what I wanted more of. I just wanted more of it. I think I hyped this up in my mind so much that there was no way it could ever live up to it. I wasn't consumed by the romance the way I wanted to be.I wanted an epic love story and I didn't get one.The whole romance felt 'meh' to me, which sucks since it's the main reason I read this book. I wanted the angst, the longing, the pining, the yearning! You romance readers know what I'm talking about. Instead, I got a lot of sex scenes. And while I don't mind it, I wanted more romance than sex. It didn't live up to my expectations.I also liked but didn't love the characters. I used to love Nesta, and while I liked her growth and seeing her overcome her trauma, she didn'tfeellike the Nesta I liked so much in ACOWAR. Maybe it's just my disappointment, but she and Cassian felt off to me. Just slightly out of character when compared to what I'd seen before. Then again, people are different from different perspectives.Having seen it all before from Feyre's POV means that we got a biased, not necessarily accurate representation of who they are.That brings me to the fact that I actually liked the Inner Circle more in this book than before. I still don't love them and think they're all lowkey horrible in their own way, but I was more ok with them. Maybe because unlike Feyre, who saw them as perfect people who could do no wrong, Nesta isn't afraid to point out their flaws. Unfortunately, Cassian is blind to the fact that Rhys has flaws at all. It bothered me so much how angry and borderline violent he'd become whenever Nesta mentioned she didn't like Rhys. I also hated how Cassian was so unbothered when Rhys threatened to kill his mate. I kept waiting for Cass to stand up for Nesta in front of Rhys. It didn't happen. I don't know why everyone in this series insists on acting like Rhys is the greatest thing since sliced bread.All of that said,I did enjoy watching Nesta come into her own, and find happiness with her new friends.\xa0I also loved Nesta's relationship with the House.\xa0The House and Nesta is a friendship I didn't know I needed. By far the best relationship in the book.!!!THE FOLLOWING IS A SPOILER!!!I hate that Nesta had to lose her power. She was death incarnate and could wield insanely powerful objects as no one else could. Then it was taken away. It's like SJM didn't want her to be a match to the ever-perfect and powerful Rhys. Same with Amren in ACOWAR. Why can't powerful women stay powerful? Also, while I'm all for girl power, Nesta and her friends shouldn't have won the Blood Rite. How do girls who have been training for three months win against warriors that have been training for years? It makes no sense.!!!SPOILER OVER!!!Also, this had a weak plot.All of the books in this series do if I'm honest. It's definitely a character-focused novel. The plot feels distant from the story. It's worse because the plot of this is very obviously a setup to other novels. The villain in this story was irrelevant, they didn't even make an appearance until the end.It feels like the introductory book in a series,which I suppose it is, but I still didn't like it. This made the book feel longer than it was, and it was already pretty gosh darn long (not that it stopped me from reading it in one go).Overall, this book was OK. Nothing more. Nothing less. I am still eagerly awaiting Azriel's book.Also!! Apparently, Feyre doesn't suck at painting! Shocking right! This is the first time that her paintings were described in detail and people actually commented on their beauty rather than just vaguely acknowledging them. In my mind she still sucks though.Ok, now I'm about to get controversial. Don't come for me, I don't have the energy for it.Apparently, all the SJM haters have been bullying people for buying this book because it's not diverse enough? WTF.If you don't want to read this book, don't. If you don't want to buy this book, don't. If you're mad because the author is writing the story she wants with the characters she wants, go read other books. It's truly that simple.Don't bully people for spending their money how they want and for reading what they want.\xa0As far as I know, Sarah J. Maas hasn't disrespected anyone in her books. Sure, her books are hella white. But if it bothers you, go read more diverse books. Don't be an asshole to people who want to read this. And don't be a hypocrite and tell people that you don't support the story but then say you're gonna pirate it because you're still interested in reading it.Read it or don't. That's all there is to it.- Sincerely, a person of color who is entirely impartial toward SJM""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Whilst ACOMAF will always remain elite, ACOSF is superior in my eyes.Yeah, I said it. 🤷🏾\u200d♀️Especially in terms of the mental health representation.Especially in terms of character study and growth.And the girls that get, absolutely fuckin’ get it!Nesta’s arc was incredibly well done.I really fuckin’ like that she wasn’t likeable.We get a lot ofheroesthat are as much of a dick as Nesta is.

Armed herself with invisible teeth and claws, and learned to strike faster, deeper, more lethally. Had relished it. But when the time came to put away the wolf, she\'d found it had devoured her, too.""Just out of respect for this book, I feel like I should be going through a mourning phase, sit with this story a little while longer and let it simmer, rather than trying to move on. I can\'t even begin to tell you how much of a therapeutic reading experience this was.It had all the SJM trademarks, great friendships, great emphasis on found families, great character development, and even greater sex. Of course.I\'d call this Part 2 toA Court of Mist and Fury. It echoes that book very much in terms of the themes discussed, i.e. depression and going through the process of healing from trauma, which she very much highlights is never linear.With Nesta that depression took on a different, more aggressive form:•\tNesta is a stone-cold bitch. I relate.•\tHer anger was fierce. I relate.•\tShe pushed people away with her attitude. On purpose. I relate.•\tLack of self-worth. I relate.•\tExtreme discomfort to emotions so anger is the easiest option. I relate.Do we see a pattern developing here?”Did she count–was she worth being counted? It was the question that sent everything crumpling inside her.”She had every right to be one (anyone that has carried this much anger and depression on their shoulders knows how much this weighs you down and debilitates you), though I initially hated how her anger would attack anyone that remotely showed any care. But your circumstances shape you. Trauma leaves an imprint. Hurt people hurt people. She was trapped in a vicious cycle of self-loathing and hatred and grief and it took a tremendous toll on her mental well-being. All due to her dysfunctional childhood, her body being invaded without permission and being thrust into a world she was conditioned to hate.I could write essays on Nesta’s character. I adore what Sarah J Maas did with this. There was so much attention to detail when it came to Nesta’s overall well-being, all which attributed to her growth and healing and it blew me away. It became about the little things, celebrating the small growths, embracing setbacks and moving forward in your own way and your own time.This is very much a character driven book, which is probably why I loved it so much. I’ll take that over plot any day, especially when it’s done well. However, there is a plot present. The world-building become even more epic in this book. It was so much more solid, since it was built upon from the other books in the series. I mean, that House? I want one!I didn’t want this book to end – it could’ve been longer. This almost felt like an extensive prologue. We just got to see the cusp of her capabilities asNestaand I’m craving more of her. It was incredible to see her personality come forth and shine through, behind all the layers she hid behind for so, so long.———————————————TITLE! 😭😭😭😭 I can’t believe we get to go back to this world again soon.

Still human, and I nearly went to my knees before you."" His breath caressed the shell of her ear and she couldn’t stop her eyes from fluttering shut. His smile brushed against her temple. ""Your power is a song, and one I’ve waited a very, very long time to hear, Nesta.""I didn’t have a clue how much I would love this damn book! It’s my favorite out of all of the series so far.I’ve been deeply hurt mentally and physically in my life. I used to be in a fighting school until my physical/medical shit has mostly taken things away from me. I have a couple real life girl friends, but nothing like this book, oh how I wish!! So, this book hit all of the feels for me!Nesta is an asshole, but she has some reasons with mental trauma - I can relate - I’ve got a lot of mental issues myself but not for the same reasons.I loved the fighting and strengthening scenes, I so much loved this in my life and miss it tremendously. I love the girl friends made and the girl empowerment in the book. These women went through hell!!I love Cassian so much. I love Nesta! I love all of the family and I love that damn house! Oh if I could have a house like that!!I love some of the things Sarah said in the acknowledgments.This book made me cry tears of sadness and happiness!The strength these women showed through the help of Nesta and Cas and Az were amazing. But ultimately they did it themselves. I love finding characters that are like this as I can try my hardest to be the same way. Among the many things I deal with I fight wanting to kill myself. It’s been really bad lately and I’m working with my doctors and my nature. These characters made me so happy, which I don’t have a lot of happiness and I’m so grateful. There’s only so much a person can hide about themselves trying to act all happy on the other side of the internet.Anyway, I loved this book dearly.And if it didn’t have enough action for you or was too smutty or written without certain characters and bullshit you wanted, f*ck off and write your own damn book and quit your damn bitching.

But to adequately rant (like, truly rant) about all the ways this book didn\'t work for me we just need to air it all out without an vague mentions of what went down in this book.My biggest problem with this book started and ended with Rhys and Feyre. Y\'all, I truly doNOTcare about them anymore. They had their time to shine and they did...so can we please move on? The second I read about Rhys having his shield up around Feyre so no one could detect her scent I was 1000% sure she was pregnant and pissed the fuck off because I knew somehow this was going to circle all the way back around them. And sure enough Rhys went off to be an absolute piece of garbage and not tell Feyre that she would die delivering their child since it had wings. So, when NestaFINALLYhas her big moment to show how much she\'s grown as a character it\'s overshadowed by Feyre going into labor and almost dying. Which pissed me off in itself, however, I made it 730 pages and nearly put this book down because of how triggering it was. A warning would have been nice instead of having to read about a lifeless child being born because some of us have actually been dealt that shitty card in life and would rather not have to relive those moments. I was truly ready to vomit and ended up having to skim those pages.Next up, and almost just as disappointing was the romance between Nesta and Cassian. I have loved them since day one and was so looking forward to watch their love story unravel. On one hand, I loved the physical aspect of it. SJM upped her smut game for sure in this one but that\'s pretty much where it ended. There was something major missing between the two of them that left me feeling next to nothing for them and all the tension between the two of them in the prior books was so far out the window. Truly a letdown and please don\'t even get me started on how abysmally underwhelming the ""mate"" reveal was.Third, was Nesta\'s growth. Just like I loved Nesta and Cassian together, I loved Nesta by herself. She\'s always been one of my favorite characters in this series even when she was a shitty person. So, I was always looking forward to the day when we would get Nesta\'s story because she needed a major glow up growth wise and usually SJM is really great at writing good, solid growth in her characters. But again, this fell so short that majority of it just seemed physical instead of mental. While I\'m aware she has a lot of growing to do and this book was essentially her realizing that it leads me to wonder...did we really need 750 pages just to get to that point? I think not.The only, and when I say only I really mean it, thing I thoroughly enjoyed in this story was the ""Valkyrie"" training and the friendship that Nesta, Emerie, and Gywn had. I was flying through the part were the girls were thrown into the Blood Rite and cheering them on to make it all the way to the top of Ramiel. But that\'s basically it...and to get that little enjoyment in 750 pages is just a total fail for me.Of course, even though this book totally didn\'t cut it for me and left me beyond furious (Rhys & Feyre, I\'m looking at you) I\'m still a clown and will buy the next book when it comes out because I need to see what in the hell SJM is doing with these characters. Specifically Mor..why was she nonexistent this entire book? And Azriel... are him and Elain mates or not?

It’s so unfair to the other books :((Quick Warning:Have an aspirin handy because what goes down in this book will mess with your heart.Reading this book felt like having a cold breeze brush my face after being out in the hot sun; of honey-ginger tea making its way down my sore throat. It gave me an adrenaline rush I don't think even confronting a Polar Bear would've given me.This book was definitely flawed and I wasn’t a huge fan of the plot (if there was one). Nesta and Cassian’s relationship however was like a weightless joy. Every conversation, every emotion had so much depth and every character grew in their own roundabout way.This book highlights the ramifications of the War with Hybern- Nesta's trauma and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. After losing her mother at a very young age, having to watch her father's neck being snapped right after he told her how much he loved her, being turned into a High Fae against her will, and the pain of almost losing her sister Elaine, broke something in her. Everybody has their own way of dealing with trauma. Nesta deals with it by building an invisible wall around herself and pushing away the people that love her the most by hurting them with her acid words.As she embarks on a journey towards self-development, she finds that the only one who can decimate the wall around her isCassian- A fierce Illyrian warrior and the General Commander of the Night Court.As her wall keeps degenerating over time, a deliciously romantic and sex-drenched relationship develops between them. There's obviously LOTS of steamy, ragingly passionate scenes but what is most appealing in their relationship is the minor displays of affection and the respect they have for each other and will set your soul on fire.They each challenge the status quo and reveal themselves to be stronger than anyone imagined through rigorous training and practice.I love howSarah J Maasredeemed Nesta's character in tiny steps and not like how she redeemed Rhysand in ACoMaF. Nesta's journey toward self-love wasn't smooth. She kept falling down, picking herself back up only to realize she fell deeper. This falling-down-climbing-back-up-thing went on for a while and it was so raw and real that my tear glands vowed to empty every drop from my body.For all those who hate Nesta after reading ACoFaS, let me tell you: I come from the same place. But do not let that stop you from reading this book because what's the worse that can happen, hmm? You will either hate it in which case you can always DNF it or get back to it later.

So many theories were proven and the filler chapters were giving me life. It’s perfect for those who’ve followed her series as they come out and have had to endure the torturous wait for more.But first thing’s first:what thehellhappened to the conflict that was building up in ACOFAS?I can’t have been the only one bamboozled with the way Sarah conveniently just resolved The One Big Thing that could have been the center of ACOSF. You should’ve seen my face when Cassian mentioned that Kallon DIED IN THE PREVIOUS RITE without a fuss. Like? What? Isn’t…that… why… we’re here…. ? No? Okay?And alsowhat happened to the “You’re coming with me to the Illyrian Mountains” bit?Again, another misdirection (for lack of a better word) on what we were expecting ACOSF to be. Soooo many people, me included, were expecting Nesta to move in with Cassian in a small cottage to actually live in the Windhaven Camp! I’m actually pretty sad that that didn’t come to pass BUT I’m not complaining with how things turned out.WITH THAT SAID;1. Put simply, the wait was worth it.I loved this book.I loved the plot.I loved NessianI loved the smut!!!!!!I loved the House of Wind.I loved Eris.I loved MOR (I know I’m surprised at how that turned out too).I loved Azriel-the-chaperone!“You two need a chaperone up here?”Yes. No. Yes. “I thought you were the chaperone.”Az threw him a wicked smile. “I’m not entirely sure I’m enough.”The full quote is even better than I could have hoped for!2. Another thing I love about ACOSF was the passage of time!The entire book spans about a little over a year, which justifies the crazy amount of events that happen in this behemoth of a book.Remember when the entire TOG series was said to have happened in onlyone year? Yeah I didn’t like that.3. I have a feeling that the red star that shot through the sky was Aelin falling through Prythian in KOA!PLEASE TELL ME YOU GUYS SAW IT TOO.“The mood hadn’t been helped by a rare red star blasting across the sky one day—an ill omen, Nesta had heard the priestesses muttering. Cassian reported that even Rhys had been rattled by it, seeming unusually contemplative afterward. But Nesta suspected that the omen wasn’t the only thing contributing to Rhys’s solemnity. Feyre was only two months from giving birth, and they still knew nothing about how to save her.”4. I’m just gonna take a minute here to talk about the smut.So ACOSF is officially an adult book and it shows in the smut! There is so much of it and I have only one complaint - that SJM did not flesh out a particular 34+35 scene. She no longer uses her oh-so-famous “velvet wrapped steel” innuendos. We go straight to the point with “cock” and even the word “cunt” now.It also goes without saying that the smut is decidedly more intense than what we've seen from her previous books. SJM was not kidding at all when she said she's descended into new levels of filthy when writing ACOSF.I did, however, still have some slight issues with the bookFor one, I didnotlove how Feysand hijacked certain parts of this book *cough cough the ending cough cough* It’s a Nessian book and yet Feysand is still the center of their world. No, I’m living in Nesta’s world. I want it to be all about her!I also had a slight disconnect with Nesta’s character although I can’t tell if she was acting out of character or if she was just grossly misrepresented in books 1-3 since we read it from Feyre’s POV. Nevertheless, I still love how she arced as a character and how she healed.START MAJOR SPOILERS SECTIONEnding spoilerI’m very sad that Nesta pulled an Aelin and lost majority of her powers in the end. I loved powerful!Nesta. I loved that everyone was afraid of her. I loved that she was rewriting Prythian history by merely existing. Gods that are older than Prythian itself were afraid of her. I hate how she gave that up in the end. What is it with women being rendered powerless in these books (Aelin and Amren)?Nesta spoilerI am also upset that Nesta ended up melding back with the IC? Everyone was expecting her to move out to Illyria and have her own family outside of the Night Court - I wanted that for her too. But, oh well.Azriel POV spoiler (Bonus scenehttps://drive.google.com/drive/folder...)I’m SO excited to see where his story goes. I’m not a heavy shipper for Elriel or Moriel or Azgwyn (??) but I’m interested to see who gets to be with Azriel in the end!Feysand POV spoiler (Bonus scenehttps://www.reddit.com/r/acotar/comme...ORhttps://wetransfer.com/downloads/abec...)THAT TEASER OF RHYSAND’S LAST NAME??? GIVE IT TO US SARAH WE ARE SO CLOSE.Generic spoiler…..And is anyone else scared that not even one minor character died… That’s kinda sus….END MAJOR SPOILERS SECTIONAll in all, I would give this 4.8 stars because it was just so good, save for the extremely high expectations which were kinda curbed with her sudden plot change.The Azriel bonus scene was also super interesting and I’m excited to see what book 5 has in store for us!So I'm gonna go and digest this for a few days before rereading it all over againbecause I am a slut for Nessian.———PRE ACOSF RELEASE PREDICTIONS BELOWBecause Feb 2021 is coming nearer, I'm going to post my expectations for ACOSF because I'm a simp for Nessian.These will be a mix of stories from ACOTAR 1-3 I want told from their POVs as well as their own character arcs!FOR CASSIAN> More about his upbringing and his mother> Him wrecking oneBUILDINGin the Summer Court that resulted in him being banned lol> His first encounter with Bryaxis> Cassian taking Mor’s v*rginity> What the hell was in that box he threw into the Sidra 😭😭😭😭> Training the female Illyrians and Nesta> Seeing him more as a General Commander and not the class clown/comic relief in the IC that we saw him from Feyre’s POV. I need to see Warrior!CassianFOR NESTA> Learning more about her bond with her mother> Exploring her powers and what she is> Her initial days in Velaris after being Made> Acknowledging her destructive habits and learning to heal> I want to see Amren vs Nesta OR Mor vs Nesta and have Nesta KICK THEIR ASSES> Nesta and Emerie bonding>NESTA IN ILLYRIAN LEATHERS AND WALLOPING CASSIAN IN THE RING> Nesta taking the Rite!!!!> Kicking some Illyrian butts who try to make her feel inferior> Finding her own Inner Circle because I’ll be damned if she works for Rhys> Speaking of Rhys, I wanna see Nesta make him cry (I love Rhys but we all know he and Nesta hate each other lol)> Have her let go of Elain and finally be her own person with her own life that isn’t all about protecting her younger sisterThese are just off the top of my head but obvs there are more angsty Nessian scenes that Ineeeeeedto happen or else I will die""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""1.)A Court of Thorns and Roses★★★★2.)A Court of Mist and Fury★★★3.)A Court of Wings and Ruin★★★3.1)A Court of Frost and Starlight★★★[2024 reread]★★★★i feel like this book is very polarizing among readers, but i think i land on the unpopular side with believing this book is maybe sjm’s best. this is truly close to a five stars for me, and i think i was able to appreciate even more rereading it.in this first book of the acotar spin-offs, we see nesta and cassian, both doing immense healing and growing. this book does star nesta, and truly seeing her reclaim her life, her safety, her agency… it was so beautiful. the very basic premise of this book is that nesta and cassian are tasked with tracking down three magical items, one of which one of the human queens may be using. we get to see nesta learn her own powers, we get to see her train with cassian, we get to see her love - both herself and new friendships… and yes, cassian - and we get to see her heal the way she needs to heal. it was honestly very powerful and, again, i really do not think sarah gets the credit for this book that she deserves.oh, and there is a romance novel loving sentient house who stole my heart all over again. sometimes, all you really need is a friend who knows how to keep you warm in the way you need to be kept warm. i just loved this with my whole heart, friends.i have now finished my reread of what is out in the acotar series and… i had such a good time rereading all of these. I think my biggest takeaway is… i didn’t love rhysand (this feels wild to even type). i feel like he was truly book boyfriend status back in the day, but now? i feel like he made me upset way more than he ever made me swoon during this reread. And this book really solidified that, and i think it was extra amplified because cassian is such a good boy. but again, this was such a fun reread that i really enjoyed doing, and we will see if i can rereadthrone of glassvery soon!trigger + content warnings(with minor spoilers for this story!):ptsd, grief, loss of loved ones in past (parents, siblings), blood, domestic abuse in past, child abuse in past, sexual assault in past, talk of rape in past, murder, death, talk of war, sexism, misogyny, nightmares, talk of captivity in past, drowning, attempted assault and rape, talk of suicide ideation, withholding very important medical information, high-risk pregnancy, ableist and dated language for people with disabilities, emergency child birth scene (involving death of both mother and baby… this world has the power of magic so things end up okay, but i think this could be very triggering to some readers, so please use caution.)[2021 first read]★★★★listen, i can't believe we are here either. but this just truly impacted me (and made me cry) so much. i will say I feel a little biased because nesta and cassian are two of my favorite characters from this entire series but... i still didn't expect this to be so beautiful. and nesta finding these friendships and seeing them heal together, see their worth together, love unconditionally and unapologetically together? regardless of how hard and scary the journey to those steps were to even get to? seeing nesta realize she's not a bad person, no matter what the world makes her mental health believe? i really loved it.blog|instagram|youtube|kofi|spotify|amazon""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'This book made a lot of choices. Most of them were bad.A Court of Silver Flamesfeels like poorly written ACOTAR fanfiction. It has all the tags and features: making you hate the canon main characters, an uncomfortable pregnancy, the incorporation of lore you didn’t ask for and don’t need, ridiculously toxic love interests, and an unnecessary 200,000 word count.Let’s talk about the High Lord of the Night Court, a character who was a villain, then an adored main character, and now a villain again. Rhysand is so violent and overprotective and his only personality trait is “I will shred you to bits if you touch or breathe on or think about Feyre.” He literally put a shield around her so even her friends couldn’t be around her. Rhysand is only respectful to women who are submissive to him and obey his authority. He was nice to Nesta only after she made a huge sacrifice at the end for his sake. He’s so bitter, and I don’t know why Feyre finds that attractive. I liked him before because he wasn’t overprotective. He let Feyre do what she wanted. But now…“Cassian knew [Rhysand would] shred anyone who so much as blinked wrong at Feyre into a million bloody ribbons.”lol.Feyre is just a decoration in this book. Although she does have power, we don’t see her use it like she did in the previous books. What happened to that important and empowering fight to make her High Lady? Now she has no agency.I’m especially angry because this is so out of character for the Inner Circle. Mor’s development horrified me in particular. She was abused badly in the Court of Nightmares, so she knows how terrible and sick they are. Azriel even describes the way she “savored every moment in the sun… as if the first seventeen years of her life, spent in the darkness of the Hewn City, still lurked around her.” But then Mor says this:Mor sipped her tea, the portrait of elegant innocence. “We’d be better off throwing Nesta into the Court of Nightmares. She’d thrive there.”What happened to the Inner Circle who accepted Feyre with open arms and helped her heal from her sorrow and trauma? Is Feyre’s grief more palatable to the Inner Circle than Nesta’s? The sisters process their hurt in different ways, but Rhysand acts like Nesta is an embarrassment to the family because of it, like they would be the perfect family if it weren’t for her. In contrast, Feyre gets all the support she needs. There are ways to build up new protagonists without turning the ones we already love into villains.I haven’t even talked about the worst part of the book yet: Feyre’s situation. (I think this was revealed pretty early in the book, so it isn’t a spoiler. But you can fast forward to the next paragraph if you don’t want to know.) Feyre is in the middle of a life-threatening pregnancy with a baby that could literally rip her apart. Guess who decides by committee that it would be better not to tell her this vital information about her pregnancy, her health, her life, and the baby inside her body. That’s right: Rhysand and the Inner Circle. A really important theme of ACOTAR is individual, personal freedom. But this threw that all away. I cannot describe how infuriated this made me. And when Nesta made the decision to tell Feyre that childbirth would kill her (a decision made out of spite, but still a good one for Feyre), the response from the other characters was bizarre. From what I remember, Feyre was upset but ultimately supported the Inner Circle’s decision to hide this from her, and Nesta was forcibly and emphatically rejected by her family. I can’t make this stuff up.Parts ofA Court of Silver Flameswere good, although they were few and far between. The Blood Rite was pretty cool. The tension and high stakes and character development and the way the Valkyries bonded in their struggle was amazing. I really liked Emerie and Gwyn, and I’m invested in their backgrounds and their journeys to come. They are refreshingly unproblematic and normal. They are easy characters to love.Besides the ending, the plot wasn’t very good. The search for the Crown/Harp/Mask felt arbitrary and too random for my taste. It also got sidetracked constantly, so it wasn’t satisfying to me. However, this gripe seems so minor compared to the rest of the dumpster fire that isA Court of Silver Flamesthat I don’t even care.“My mate” every other pageHas filled me with unending rageBreaking Dawn-esque pregnancyFeels like a fanfic fever dreamAzriel, he shadow-singsCas doesn’t have the longest wingsFeyre does interior designNesta walks a narrow lineGwyn and Emerie are true heroesCassian’s over five zero zeroSister’s sick?

I got so much to say, so jumping right in.Why I rated it 1 star when I read it the first time-1. I read the whole series in one go instead of pacing myself or giving a break in between the ACOTAR world. Reading it immediately after ACOWAR and ACOFAS backfired. It led me to bebored.2. I thought it wastoo smutty.Which it still is fyi but this did not concern me in my reread oddly.3. I hadnot liked Nesta.Jumping straight from Feyre's journey was not an ideal decision. Feyre had a trilogy, so spending a lot of time with her compared to just one book of Nesta's did make an impact. I was still angry with Nesta and her treatment of Feyre.4. I simplyforgot about the majority of eventsthat were correlated to the Crescent City series when I made my GR account and rated it.Why I give it 5 stars now-1. Ipaced myself.Gave myself some time in between ACOWAR, AOCFAS and ACOSF. This worked brilliantly for me. There was proper balance.2. Idid not expect muchas I was concerned about how this reread will go. With my expectations low, the reread ended surprising me.3.I ADORED Nestathis time around. I found her journey admirable, relatable and far more understandable. Her struggles were portrayed in such a raw manner and the way she overcame them bit by bit was chef's kiss. I too, like the other characters had not given her a fair chance but when I did the way she blossomed into a wonderful character was worth rereading!! Nesta is such a badass and although I am not saying she was not wrong before (she was) but I understand now.I see Nesta Archeron, her being, and she is worthy.4.Romance and banterwas so fun. Cassian is such a softie and marshmallow at heart. I swear I just wanna give him a big bear hug.5. I loved reading about thepossibilities of different worlds connecting.There's so much that can happen.6. Theendingwas so emotional. I swear I was sobbing.Some things that might be controversial but I wanna state my take on it-1. I see people call Rhysand an arrogant asshole a lot in reference to his persona in this book.I disagree.Sure, he was harsh a bit but never arrogant, never an asshole. Rhys was always honest, never lying to anyone or Nesta. He has his mate to look after, his court to look after. People think that just cause he is Feyre's mate that's all there is to him. Wrong! Rhys is also High Lord. Trained to be a leader and warrior, he talks and acts like one. He doesn't have to act soft towards others he doesn't know well. And Nesta was that one person, he did not know.Just cause someone criticizes you, does not mean they are your enemy.The amount of hate Rhys gets is just uncalled for imo.2. This might not be so controversial butNesta's powers???The thing that happened at the end should not have happened. That's all I'll say to keep it spoiler free lol.Without elaborating much on my private life, I just wanna say- I felt Nesta's journey deeply and it resonated with me. There have been some changes in my own life since the last time I read this book and all I say to Nesta is, I get it.Man, I just had a completely new experience reading this lmao. Am sitting here as I draft my review, thinking wtf did I read the first time😂🙈~•~•~It's time to give Nesta another chance.

How strongly and personally it touched me.This is not an easy book to read and understand.I guess that part of its rawness and bittersweet tones are to blame on the fact that it's told from Nesta's pov, a character who was firstly written to be hated and who probably hates herself more than the audience ever could and eventually did.She's a very intense fictional person, and I'd lie if I said she didn't frustrate me to no end in more than one occasion.But I guess that's exactly what SJM wanted from this character.I could literally feel the self-hatred exude from the pages. The self-sabotaging, the way Nesta, who's never been a saint but who maybe was programmed to feel like she was one, denies herself everything that makes her feel even remotely worthy of light.I know how that feels, and I wanted to see what she would do to use her pain, her trauma and her past to mold herself into a new, damaged yet not spoilt, perpetually-evolving creature.I wasn't disappointed.I actually got more than I expected, because I eventually ended up falling in love with all the nuances this character possesses.Not one of them had offered to help save the Archeron family from poverty.They had thrown them all, mere children and a crumbling man, to the wolves.So Nesta had become a wolf. Armed herself with invisible teeth and claws, and learned to strike faster, deeper, more lethally. Had relished it. But when the time came to put away the wolf, she’d found it had devoured her, too.I must admit I never really was a fan of Nesta, but I didn't really ever hate her, either. I was simply indifferent to her and her antics, especially considering I knew being ACOTAR a Beauty and the Beast retelling, at least one of the sisters must be an asshole, and that's Nesta for you.I started getting interested in her as a character at the start of ACOWAR and, confession time, I mainly did it because of a pretty awesome Nessian fanart I've seen on instagram.Oh, don't judge me.The point is, as weak as I am for a good and steamy romance, it takes more than fantart and a few stolen glances to make me appreciate a difficult character, and if SJM managed to steal my heart with her Nesta, in the end, it means she did a great job that goes way beyond ships and smut.For the majority of the previous novels, Nesta is an unlikeable character, and for obvious reasons, the author doesn't want you to like her, so that it feels even more genuine when you start seeing there's good in her, and that she's perfectly nuanced, just like a real person.“There can be nothing more than sex, Cassian.”His jaw tightened, and he seemed to struggle with some internal battle before he said darkly, “Then I’ll take whatever you offer me.” He leaned in, his body still not touching hers, and said against her ear, “And I’ll take you however you wish me to.”Her toes curled on the stones, her hair dripping. “And if I wish to take you?”He smiled against her ear. “Then I’ll beg you to ride me into oblivion.”I want to discuss her character's journey in this review, because the book itself was good and the plot -the amount that was there, at least- was okay, but A Court of Silver Flames is a charcater-driven novel where the protagonist wasn't always a good person.For example, I've read at least a dozen reviews complaining about how this book makes you love Nesta and hate the rest of the original characters, or the opposite, and I can't say I don't see wher they come from, but I was lucky enough to fall in neither of these two categories since I've ended up loving Nesta and loving the other characters, as well, at the same time.They didn't always treat her with kindness, but I feel like they treated her in a very realistic way.When someone keeps pushing their luck, it's only a matter of time before people lose their patience.I loved how they each had a chance to connect and tangle their story with Nesta's, getting to know her, getting loved and understood by her, all of them finally getting a second chance at redemption and healing.One of the scenes I loved the most, is in fact, towards the end when Rhys kneels in front of Nesta after she's saved both Feyre and her baby's life. I lost it completely when they hugged.Nesta isn't an easy person to get along with. She's got a past that pretty much justifies her actions, but the way she choses to handle the consequences is all her own. And that's the point I feel like we need to remember. All her flaws are on display right from the start and there are moments when it even gets worse, but it's all part of her journey.It's only when you reach rock bottom that you can do anything but go up, right?“You could have ruled the world with your power,” he said carefully.“I don’t want to rule the world.” Her eyes were unguarded in a way he had never seen. Mate, she had called him.“What do you want?” Cassian managed to ask, voice rasping.She smiled, and damn if it wasn’t the loveliest thing he’d ever seen. “You.”“You’ve had me from the moment you met me.”She tucked a strand of hair behind an arched ear. “I know.”I loved how Nesta's relationship with Elain and Feyre was addressed. Elain could never do anything wrong in Nesta's eyes and the moment she (presumably) turned her back on her, Nesta was forcefully faced with a truth she wasn't ready to see, or better, that she didn't want to see.Same thing with Feyre. I felt like the sybolism of Feyre hanging paintings of everyone but Nesta in the new, opulent house she and her husband created, was for Nesta worse than any offense the inner circle ever thrown her way (and not without merit).One of the things Nesta resented most about about Feyre, in fact, is the fact that Nesta needed her to survive but Feyre didn't need her in return. Feyre was nothing but kind to her, all the time, but she hit her in the most subtle of ways, in a way that is more important to Feyre than words.Mind it, I don't mean what Nesta did and how she acted in the past is condonable, I'm just saying there's a reason behind her actions, reasons that will definitely help you (I don't say like, because you're allowed to still not like a character even if their past is justified) understand her a bit more.Nesta, as I see her, didn't like the hate and anger she felt all the time, especially towards her little sister. She, in fact, hated it and hated herself for feeling it.I've seen reviewers claim Nesta's friendship with Gwyn and Emerie made no sense, since she already had two sisters she could connect and make up with; I see their point, but I feel like Nesta was re-discovering herself and creating bonds tentatively presenting herself as the new person she was trying to become.Her relationship with the House, for example, was my absolute favorite. In my opinion, the fact that the House was stubborn, sweet, sarcastic in its own special way, warm and curious, added to the knowledge that Nesta Made it, makes me wonder (and hope) if that's exactly how Nesta sees her true self, if that's what she'd like others to see her.Rhys lifted his head. “This is a bad idea.”Cassian winked. “That should be written on the Night Court crest.”I loved seeing her through the eyes of someone who didn't fully know the darkest sides of her trauma and grief; I feel like it gave Nesta a glimps of what her life with her sisters could have been had her mother not gaslighted her into needing to be perfect at all costs, filling her head with conjectures and prejudices and depriving her from being free to decide what to do with her personality and future.And that's where Cassian finally jumps in. God bless that guy, honestly.I absolutely LOVED how he wasn't afraid to call her out on her bullshit but still knew (my god, he justknew) she needed some love despite it all, simple as that, and without asking anything in return.And sure, both Feyre and Elain loved Nesta, but I feel like the relationship the three sisters always had was always taunted by what they had to endure for and with one another.Feyre and Rhys will always own my heart, but Cassian and Nesta gave me the best emotions and I will never forget how beautiful they are together.And, holy shitNesta at the end, deciding she one day will want to have a baby with her Cassian completely destroyed me in the sweetest of ways. I don't consider motherhood as something essential, something you need to experience because it's mandatory to feel like a real woman. If a person feels complete and accomplished without ever having kids, I totally support it, but as a mother who has a problematic mother, I think it's one more proof of the fact that Nesta's journey is heading to a genuinely happy path.“I’ll be with you every step of the way,” he whispered into her palm. “Just don’t lock me out. You want to walk in silence for a week, I’m fine with that. So long as you talk to me at the end of it.”Plotwise speaking, there wasn't much going on, but I enjoyed it, nonetheless.One of the chapters I liked the most is when Nesta, Cassian and Azriel (instert Brooklyn99 BoyleMy fantasy threesome!gif) went to the Bog of Oorid looking for the Mask.I was fucking terrified by the whole Kelpie encounter.And the gift sharing moment was e v e r y t h i n g.I love Az with all my heart sigh.Also, I adored basically every scene with Gwyn and Emerie, especially when they were together.Maas's writing is exquisite as usual. I'll never stop being amazed by how vividly I can picture in my mind the scenes she describes.The only plotline I wish was handled a little better was the Rhys/Feyre andyou know whatone. Every choice Rhys made fromthatpoint, felt a bit uncharacteristical and not well thought enough.I decided to blame it on the emotion, because I refuse to think our Rhys would be anything but pragmatic when it comes to his Feyre's safety.Sorry if all of this makes little sense. This book and this character in particular made me really emotional in a way I'd never thought I'd feel toward a fantasy book carachter.Oh, and to lighten up the mood after this sob fest...this book also taught me something I've suspected for a while now, and that is, that everyone in acotar wants a piece of Azriel. Who am I to disagree.Nesta could hardly remember words. But she found them when she whispered into the darkness, “Stay with me.”A shudder rocked through him, but he only smiled as he tucked her into his side.And warm and safe and home at last in Cassian’s arms, Nesta slept.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '”Your power is a song, and one I’ve waited a very, very long time to hear, Nesta”.Aviso: la primera parte de esta reseña va a estar libre despoilersy les diré cuando empiecen a aparecer para que puedan dejar de leerla si no quieren saber qué pasa.No sé por qué me sigo sorprendiendo de que Sarah J. Maas lo logre una y otra vez. Es absolutamente impresionante lo que esta mujer puede llegar a transmitir con sus palabras. De verdad, leyendo ACOSF sentí que me destrozaban hasta lo más hondo y que luego, poco a poco, me iban reconstruyendo y poniendo cada pieza en su lugar.Como muchos aquí, debo confesar que no estaba tan emocionada por este libro porque se centraría en Nesta. Pero, así mismo, tengo que admitir que me comí todas y cada una de mis reservas y que, leyendo cada página, entendí profundamente a Nesta, sus traumas, su sufrimiento, su personalidad, la culpa que siente todo el tiempo y la sensación de que nunca eres lo suficientemente bueno para nadie. Y no sólo la entendí, sino que me sentí jodidamente identificada. Y, claro, luego me di cuenta de que odiaba tantísimo a Nesta porque reflejaba las partes más horribles de mí misma.ACOSF es un libro tremendamente intenso y lleno de emociones, de momentos de confrontar los sentimientos más oscuros, de arrepentimientos, rabia y odio. Pero también es una historia que lleva a Nesta en un camino que le permite enfrentar todos los demonios que tiene por dentro, todas las cosas que se ha guardado durante años, las decisiones que le quitaron de las manos y su odio hacia sí misma. Y, a pesar de lo oscuro que es el pozo en el que está y de lo duro que es el camino, Nesta se va a dar cuenta de que siempre va a existir alguien al otro lado de esa oscuridad para tenderle una mano, para caminar junto a ella y para recordarle una y otra vez que sí que se merece el amor de sus amigos y de su familia. Que nunca va a estar sola.En serio, no les puedo decir con palabras lo hondo que me llegó esta historia al corazón. Sí, es el libro máshotde Sarah J. Maas y todas esas escenas están diseñadas para ser leídas mientras estás en una tina llena de hielo porque… joder. Y obviamente las marqué todas y casi me da un infarto leyendo otras. Y también mucha envidia. Pero más allá de eso, creo que eran una forma súper poderosa de comunicar lo mucho que Nesta necesitaba una distracción, salirse de sus pensamientos durante unos momentos… u horas (because Fae lovers, jajaja) porque estar dentro de su cabeza era demasiado doloroso. Y la entiendo.Y Cassian… ay, ¿cómo puede existir alguien tan bueno, valiente, sensible y paciente? Si amaron a Cassian en los libros anteriores, en este van a querer abrazarlo (y más cosas, ejem) hasta que todo esté bien para él. No se pueden imaginar todo lo que conocemos sobre Cassian en ACOSF, sobre su pasado, sus sentimientos, sus miedos y, sobre todo, cómo es tan genuino como para siempre demostrar lo mucho que le importan quienes son cercanos para él, todo lo que estaría dispuesto a hacer y soportar por ellos. En este libro, Cassian enfrenta toda la tormenta de proporciones épicas que significa estar cerca de Nesta, pero lo hace porque sabe que ella está en un lugar oscuro, que está luchando por salir de allí y él la entiende… porque ha estado él mismo en ese camino antes. Joder, es que, de verdad… después de leer este tipo de cosas, ves a las personas del mundo real y te das cuenta de que eso no existe. Ojalá todos pudiéramos tener la certeza de que, cuando salgamos de nuestros momentos más oscuros, siempre va a estar alguien allí esperándonos para decirnos que todo va a estar bien o incluso sólo para sonreírnos o abrazarnos.Ahora, obviamente todo el libro no se centra únicamente en Nesta y Cassian, sino que Sarah J. Maas nos presenta una nueva amenaza que puede, nuevamente, destruir todas las Cortes e incluso afectar al mundo de los humanos. Pero esta es una amenaza mucho más antigua, poderosa y letal de lo que el Rey de Hybern pudo llegar a ser. Más adelante hablaré de ello, pero me gustó que hubiera una historia paralela de conflicto, de magia arcana y de monstruos que no pueden volver a caminar libremente por el mundo.Antes de empezar con la sección despoilers, tengo que decirles que amé profundamente volver a ver a los personajes que adoro. Feyre, Rhysand, Mor, Amren y Azriel no son solamente sombras en el fondo de las escenas de ACOSF, sino que siguen siendo importantes y están allí para los momentos más críticos. Ahora, que ellos sean ligeramente menos importantes en este libro que Cassian y Nesta no quiere decir que Sarah J. Maas no los vaya a usar para rompernos el corazón, triturar los pedacitos, sumergirlos en ácido y luego incinerarlos. De verdad, es tremendo… Y lo único que diré, y que discutiré más a fondo más adelante, es que les juro que no pude parar de llorar con el último 10% del libro. Y no precisamente de felicidad.Vamos con losspoilersy con Isa perdiendo la cabeza… de nuevo.•••1. Sí, vamos a hablar de la dedicatoria del libro. Cuando la leí al principio dije como “oh, vaya, bueno”, pero ahora que la estoy releyendo y estoy escribiendo esta reseña, puedo decirles que casi lloro. Dice”For every Nesta out there, climb the mountain”.2. Las pesadillas que tiene Nesta nos dan una pista de todo lo que está batallando por dentro desde que la sumergieron en elCauldrony, joder, poco a poco entendemos por qué es como es. Nadie que lidie con pesadillas que describe como el frío antes de las estrellas, el vacío antes del infierno, puede siquiera fingir estar bien.3. ¿Cómo me atreví a juzgar a Nesta sin saber que ella sentía la inmortalidad como un fuego eterno y no como una serena juventud? Son estas pequeñas frases las que nos dan, incluso en las primeras páginas, las pistas que necesitamos para ver lo destrozada que está, que toda su mala actitud es una coraza para protegerse.4. Me rompe el corazón ver a Cassian al principio del libro admitiendo que el fuego helado de los ojos de Nesta siempre había sido una tentación para él. Y es que justo lo piensa cuando está en su apartamento destartalado en donde ella se ha estadofuckinga cuantos machos Fae quisiera y bebiendo hasta perder el conocimiento… Y lo peor es que Nesta tiene a un macho en su cuarto en ese momento. Agh.5. Y luego ella admite para sí misma que todo ese sexo con desconocidos, el alcohol y la música la ayuda a apagar un poco ese fuego frío y oscuro que la consume desde que la forzaron a entrar alCauldron. Nesta siempre ha estado muy rota y siento que la hemos juzgado demasiado sin saber exactamente lo mal que lo estaba pasando dentro de su cabeza.6. Lo triste es que hay una cita que dice que ese sexo no la hacía sentir nada más allá de un momento fugaz de liberación de ese poder cataclísmico que hay dentro de ella. Pero luego se ríe un poco y dice que incluso los siglos de experiencia que algunos machos Fae tienen no los hacen buenos en la cama, jajaja.7. EL HORROR del momento en el que Cassian vuelve a ese apartamento y le dice que se nota que ni siquiera se ha dignado a cambiar las sábanas entre sus visitantes PORQUE PUEDE OLERLOS. Dioses, en serio Nesta está en un punto muy bajo en ese momento.8. Es tremendo cuando Feyre y los demás le dan un ultimátum a Nesta: o accede a entrenar con Cassian por las mañanas y a ayudar a las acólitas de la biblioteca por las tardes e intenta enderezar su vida o la van a enviar de vuelta al mundo humano. Esa pelea y esa conversación son durísimas, pero tenían que darle un empujón para que empezara a salir de ese pozo.9. AMO A RHYSAND. Hay un momento en el que está hablando con Cassian después de la “intervention” de Nesta. Y Cass le dice que tiene que volver a entrenar porque no querría que Feyre, sumate, encontrara partes blandas en su cuerpo. Y RHYS RESPONDE QUE ELLA NUNCA ENCUENTRA NADA BLANDO Y OMG, JAJAJA. Y luego hablan de que Rhys les dio el día libre a los sirvientes y Cassian cree que es para que no los escuchen pelear después de lo de Nesta, pero Rhys le dice que no son las peleas lo que no quiere que escuchen, AIUDA.10. Se me rompió MAL el corazón cuando Cassian vio el retrato de Feyre y Rhys juntos, sus anillos y a ellos mismos y lo invadió ese sentimiento de querer lo que ellos tienen, a alguien especial a su lado. POBRECILLO MÍO.11. Ay, dioses, y más adelante Cassian dice que tiene que alejarse mucho de la casa del río porque no quiere ni oírlo ni sentir su poder cuando Rhys… acabe. PERO ES QUE ESO NO ES TODO. Luego menciona como quien no quiere la cosa que, cuando eran más jóvenes, Az, Rhys y Cassian se f*llaban a muchísimas hembras Y GENERALMENTE EN LA MISMA HABITACIÓN. ¿ES QUE NADIE VA A HABLAR DE ESTO? O sea… dioses. A mí nadie me puede quitar de la cabeza que esos tres…you know. QUIERO UNFANFICDE ESTO YA MISMO.12. AMO cada vez que Cassian molesta a Nesta recordándole lo mucho que le gusta leer novelas eróticas, jajaja.13. Uf, también me rompe el corazón los momentos en los que Nesta admite para sí misma que sabe lo desagradable que es con los demás, lo dura que es la coraza que la rodea y lo asustada que está ella misma de ese pozo infinito de poder oscuro que tiene dentro de ella. Y hay una cita en la que dice que siempre se sintió cómoda siendo como un lobo, como un depredador, pero que cuando llegó el momento de eliminar a ese ser feroz, se dio cuenta de que la había devorado incluso a ella.14. Ehhh… ¿podemos hablar de que Rhys sigue siendo un loquillo? Es que le habla por el vínculo mental a Cassian en medio de dos… eh…roundscon Feyre,if you know what I mean.15. A ver, todos sabemos que, tarde o temprano, Cassian y Nesta van a hacerlo sobre todas las superficies de la Casa, pero es que toda la tensión previa es la que me matabaaaaaa. ¡La tensión y las frases con doble sentido y los gruñidos bajos! En el primer día de entrenamiento, Cassian le dice a Nesta, con voz súper grave, que le alegra que se haya levantado lista para jugar. Y ELLA SE DERRITE AUNQUE NUNCA LO ACEPTARÁ EN VOZ ALTA… todavía.16. PERO LO QUE SÍ RECUERDA ES ESE MOMENTO EN LA BATALLA FINAL, ahhhh. O sea, cuando pensaron que iban a morir y él la besó y le dijo que desearía haber tenido más tiempo, pero que la encontrará en esta vida y las siguientes. Es que me muero. Y Nesta admite mentalmente que nunca deja de pensar en ese momento. Ayyyyyy, ya bésenseeeee.17. Sarah J. Maas me quiere matar porque luego Nesta dice que si Cassian cree que todo esto de entrenar va a terminar con ella subiéndose a su cama, que está muy equivocado. Y él dice que eso está clarísimo, que él no se va a subir a la cama de ella, PORQUE ES ELLA QUIEN VA A SUPLICAR ESTAR EN LA CAMA DE CASSIAN. AYUDA, NECESITO AGUA FRÍA.18. Y no soy la única que necesita hielo porque cuando Cassian ve a Nesta en losIllyrian leathersde entrenar, que son pantalones y equipo muy ajustado, el pobre casi muere y empieza a fantasear sobre todo lo que haría quitándole esos pantalones y… uf.19. Y justo después de esas fantasías Cassian recuerda que no ha tenido más compañía que su mano desde hace más de dos años, cuando lo hizo duro y rápido contra una pared de ladrillo con una hembra cualquiera que encontró en un bar. O SEA, CASSIAN ESTÁHORNYY LA QUE NOS ESPERA EN ESTE LIBRO… MADRE DE TODOS LOS DIOSES.20. Esos primeros días de entrenamiento cuando Cassian lleva a Nesta a Windhaven y ella se niega a levantarse de una roca y entrenar son tremendos. Y es obvio que todos losillyrianse están burlando de Cassian por dejar que una mujer tan terca le gane… y aunque Nesta sabe que lo está haciendo ver débil y lo odia, no puede ceder porque siente que es mejor que la odie a que se acerque. MI CORAZÓN.21. Parte de la razón por la que este libro me enseñó a no odiar a Nesta es que entendemos mucho más cómo piensa. Y me identifiqué un montón, de verdad. Verla a ella era verme a mí en los momentos más horrorosos de salud mental. Cuando ella dice que odia todo lo que es, que está absolutamente exhausta y que está cansada de querer estar en un lugar que no sea su cabeza… wow.I felt that.22. Me encantó la conversación que tienen Amren y Cassian en la que ella le dice que deje que Nesta cave su propia tumba, pero que al final le ofrezca su mano. Que no se rinda y siga ofreciéndole su ayuda para salir de ese lugar oscuro.23. FAAAAAAAN de que Lucien diga que Tamlin está sufriendo y que desde el final de la guerra no ha adoptado su forma Fae, sino que está vagando por su corte como la bestia que es.Fucker.24. Sabes que se vienen problemas cuando empiezas a enterarte de que las criaturas poderosísimas que inclinaron la balanza en favor de la Corte de la Noche tienen hermanos. En este caso, nos presentan a Koschei, el hermano delBone Carver. Y que parece que está aliado con Briallyn, una de las reinas que entró alCauldrony que ahora quiere recuperar laDread Trove, una colección de objetos poderosísimos, hechos por elCauldronmismo, que tiene el poder de empezar otra guerra y borrarlos a todos del mapa.Oh, joy.25. Hay una mañana en la que Nesta casi no puede moverse porque la noche anterior intentó bajar las 10.000 escaleras que separan a la Casa de Velaris. Y Cassian se da cuenta en el desayuno y la molesta con que no se puede ni parar. Y ella lo hace apoyándose un montón en sus manos, pero él le dice que no cuenta si son las manos las que están haciendo todo el trabajo. Y ELLA LE DICE QUE SON SUS MANOS LAS QUE DEBEN ESTAR OCUPADAS TODAS LAS NOCHES, OMG. Entonces Cassian le responde con voz grave que si es eso lo que le enseñan sus libros eróticos, que sólo se hace por la noche. Él nota Y HUELE lohotque se pone ella y sigue diciendo que se puede hacer en cualquier momento, con la luz del día, durante un baño o incluso después de una LARGA Y DURA sesión de entrenamiento. En serio, lean este libro con hielo a la mano.26. ¡Lo peor es que toda esa conversación sucede mientras Az también está en la mesa con ellos! Y al final, cuando Nesta se va, Azriel le dice a Cassian que lo va a tener muy jodido, pero él ya no lo está ni escuchando porque en su cabeza se está imaginando todo lo que las manos de Nesta podrían hacer con él y JODER, LES DIJE QUE ESTE LIBRO ES DEMASIADO CALIENTE. Y ESO QUE NO HA SUCEDIDO NADA.27. Uf, golpe bajo cuando, en medio de una pelea porque Nesta sigue negándose a entrenar en Windhaven, Cassian también explota y ella le responde diciéndole que genial, que menos mal ya no lo va a tener babeando detrás de ella y que le costó mucho entender las señales de que ella no lo quería. Y MALDITA SEA, OBVIAMENTE LO QUIERES. Y ÉL A TI. Pero también entiendo la reacción de querer alejar a todo el mundo cuando ni tú te soportas a ti misma.***SIGUE EN COMENTARIOS***'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""3.5 stars.here comes the post-series hangover.it's safe to say that this series has my entire heart.nesta’s redemption arc is 751 pages of smutty illyrian desperation (maybe slightly too smutty?!) and self discovery. i now like nestabecausei’ve also disliked her. the ugliest parts of nesta are things that i recognize in myself and that’s the beauty of this book.✨a court of smut and self-help.✨and, of course, men with wings are just superior in every way.🤍 i need azriel to get his own booknow(though preferably not with elain lol)(acowar & acomaf remain my favorites from this series, but i can’t wait to see what sjm has in store for books 5 and 6.)""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '[2022] edit:changed my mind this is more of a 4 star than a 5🙃_________________I\'m sobbing that was so beautifulAll hailQueen Nestaand SJM for making melove her so muchI don\'t know what to do with myself now.Like actually, I think I\'m gonna be in a book hangover forweeks— no,monthsomg I cannot.

There wasn\'t a single scene where I didn\'t feel likemy heart was breaking.This was such an emotional ride. I could actually relate to Nesta and while it isn\'t as severe as her, there are times where I\'d also hate myself and feel like I deserve nothing. And seeing Nesta deal with all of this --it broke me in so many ways. To have her in so much pain and think that she herself has to change in order to be ""fixed""... ohmygod no I swear I cant.😭🤚Then there was Cassian. I love how he wouldn\'t give up on Nesta and even while trying to help her, he still didn\'t let her get away with everything.He kept reaching out his handthroughout it all.

Honestly, it had to be my favourite part of her story.Nesta\'s friendship with Emerie and Gwyn was so, so,so wholesome and sweet.Each of them had their own past that haunted them and were afraid for the other to find out.But that\'s exactly what made them fit so well together.That moment where they all shared their secrets with each other, realizing that the other wouldn\'t be judging them...I cried so muchnot surprisingomg it was so beautiful to see them open up.Their love for each other was tested especially when they had to participate in The Blood Rite.

I was dying on the inside. Just thinking about him crying, is making me cry.

It\'s just like we all think of her and hate her for that. Everyone expects Elain to be one thing, so she acts like that BUTis that truly Elain?So yeah, I judged her too early. (Feysand\'s POV really helped with this too) I shouldn\'t hate her right away because there\'s still her story to be told. I\'m actually excited to see that.But even knowing all of this, I still don\'t like Elain.🤷\u200d♀️ I understand it and everything but just something about her rubs me off the wrong way. I don\'t hate her, but I don\'t like her either. I have no doubt Sarah will make us love, or at the very least, like Elain next book.Also, I seriously do not ship her with Azriel.I believeAzriel and Gwynwould be such a beautiful pair ohmygod I\'d love that so much. If the three brothers get with the three archeron sisters...no no no,pleaseno. And I absolutely love the Azriel POV. My heart is hurting so much for Azzy🥺 He needs the love he deserves.Omg every time he\'d appear as the""chaperone""for Nesta and Cassian--omg I was dying of laughter. I loved those scenes. Poor Azzy having to deal with Nesta and Cas, tsk tsk naughty Fae. But the friendship between Nesta and Azzy ohmygod my heart, im crying it was so beautiful. Azzy have NestaAlso, something else as to why I think AzrielxElain wont be endgame is because during the solstice dance, both Cas and Eris talk about how smothered/plain Elain is wearing black, which I feel like is SJM\'s way of saying thatElain isn\'t compatible with The Night Court and it\'s darkness & shadows.ahhh I truly feel like she\'s going to go to another court in the next book.Also Azzy\'s shadowsdisappearwhen they\'re around Elain. Meanwhile, the shadowsdontdisappear around Gwyn...they come alive around her.

And for Lucien to find out the truth🥺 We need a Lucien book so bad omg so many books needed.I\'m so curious as to what really was going on when Nesta asked about Jurian & Vassa and Lucien replied sharply HMM I may be reading too much into that, but something\'s going on ughhh I wanna know more about those three.ALSO,ERIS. There is SO MUCH MORE to Eris then is shown. I really want to see more Eris and his story. I believe there\'s a lot more to him and Cas even sees that he\'s a decent guy.Oh, another thing I forgot to mention was the fact thatNesta Made three magic weaponsand one of them she named the swordAtaraxia, which meansInner Peace...I\'m in love. I stan Nesta so much. She grew to be so much stronger than she was before annnnnd the tears are coming in again.😃✌This reminds me of Feyre and Nesta\'s relationship. *sobs* It brings me joy to see thetwo finally understand and show their love for each other. No matter what, Feyre wouldn\'t give up on her either. She tried so hard to help Nesta and I love Feyre so much for that. Unlike *cough* some people *cough* Rhysand. I actually despise him SO MUCH, it was so messed up. The way I hate this guy with every fibre of my being😃Although, I have to say that when Nesta apologized to everyone it irked me. Like yeah, she did say harmful things to them, but the Inner Circle did too?? Honestly, they should\'ve apologized too, mainly Rhys and Amren but ah, that didn\'t happen *rage* they should grovel at her feet.OMG WAIT. JUST ONE MORE THING I REALIZED.THIS:THAT WASAELIN.

",Sarah J. Maas,3.74,1598824,8048,"Fantasy, Romance, Romantasy, Young Adult, Fiction, New Adult, Fantasy Romance",272,01-05-2018,"Feyre, Rhysand, and their friends are still busy rebuilding the Night Court and the vastly altered world beyond, recovering from the war that changed everything. But Winter Solstice is finally approaching, and with it, the joy of a hard-earned reprieve.Yet even the festive atmosphere can't keep the shadows of the past from looming. As Feyre navigates her first Winter Solstice as High Lady, her concern for those dearest to her deepens. They have more wounds than she anticipated-scars that will have a far-reaching impact on the future of their court.Bridging the events ofA Court of Wings and Ruinwith the later books in the series,A Court of Frost and Starlightexplores the far-reaching effects of a devastating war and the fierce love between friends.","[{'rating': 3, 'content': '”Mother above and Cauldron save me.”Yep, that’s exactly what I thought when I read another one of Feyre and Rhy’s naughty scenes! The words might have been the same; my thoughts came with an eye roll instead of pleasure though. As did a lot of other things while I read this novella. Don’t get me wrong, I still enjoyed almost every second of this and it was really nice to spend some time with all those characters again BUT (yes, it’s a big but) there were a lot of things that didn’t sit well with me and you can bet your lovely behind on the fact that I’m going to point them out later on when I get to the spoilery parts of this review.Generally speaking this wasn’t bad. We got to see a little bit of our characters normal lives and I think we can all agree that after everything they went through they deserve some normalcy and happiness. It was nice to walk through Velaris, to go Solstice shopping with Mor and Feyre and to see those beloved characters interact with each other. They all survived the war and each and every single one of them is trying to cope with the aftermath. There are plenty of wounds that still need to heal and I’m kind of grateful Sarah decided to give her characters some room to come to terms with everything. So yes, this novella might not have a huge plot but definitely provides a good transition into the next series. ;-)Still, there were quite a lot of interesting dialogues and a bunch of things that either made me happy or caused me to get angry. Mostly it was the relationships between the characters and so this is exactly what I’m going to write about. Buckle up! This is going to be a hard ride! *lol*From here on out, I’ll talk about the relationships and ships of the characters, so this isn’t only going to be rant and gush feast but also a spoiler celebration! If you still continue to read and haven’t read ACOFAS yet, it’s at your own risk! Don’t say I didn’t warn you! ;-)The relationships & ships:Feyre & Rhys:”But you are bothering – you’re both still working to make this peace last. Peace, Rhys. We have peace, and the true kind. Enjoy it – enjoy each other. You paid the debt before it was ever a debt.”I totally agree with Cassian and even though this might sound harsh now I still need to say it: I want them to enjoy each other too, but please not as the MCs of the following books. I love Feyre and Rhys, I really do, but I think from ACOWAR on out their character development was kind of detrimental. I already mentioned it in my review of ACOWAR and I’ll say it again Feyre’s and Rhys’s holier-than-thou attitude is beginning to get on my nerves. Feyre and her friends weren’t the only ones that suffered and it would be really nice if she’d get out of her pink bubble and would acknowledge the fact that others hurt too! It’s good that Rhys and her have each other but not everyone is as lucky as them and it would help to remember that they made mistakes too! Also if I read about “toes that curl” in Feyre’s boots one more time I’m going to be sick. Yes, we got it, Rhys is such a sexy male and they really love each other. If you ask me their story should have ended after ACOWAR because right now I have more negative feelings towards them than positive ones and this is actually kinda sad. >_< Okay, Feysand shippers are allowed to take out their pitchforks and torches now... Just give me a little head start, will you? ;-PFeyre & Lucien:”And what, exactly, does this Band of Exiles plan to do? Host events? Organize party-planning committees?”Lucien’s metal eye clicked faintly and narrowed. “You can be as much of an asshole as that mate of yours, you know that?”I think Feyre was a real bitch to Lucien in this book. And no, I’m not sorry for saying it out loud. After all someone has to do it and I don’t mind it being me. I mean if she really wants him to be friends with her, she has to accept that he has his own life and doesn’t want to depend on her and Rhys. If she’d be honest to herself she’d realize that Lucien isn’t welcome at her court and that he has his reasons to stay away from them. I think the only two people who feel real sympathy for Lucien are Az and Amren and they only do it to some extent. So yeah, she can’t expect him to be happy with the situation. Lucien lost so much over the centuries and now he even lost Tam and his second home. It’s not Feyre’s call to decide what’s best for him! Especially because she’s actually the reason why Lucien isn’t welcome at Tam’s place anymore. So nope, take care of your own court and leave Lucien be! Thank you very much! And a huge YAY for Lucien! Because he dared to call Feyre and Ryhs out on their bullsh*t and didn’t back down! That’s my man!!! <333 Also I totally agree with him! Rhys shouldn’t have said what he did and the way he treated Tam cost him a lot of my sympathy.”Your mate should have known better than to kick a downed male.””I can’t stand to be in the same room as her for more than two minutes. I can’t stand to be in this court and have your mate pay for the very clothes on my back.”Elain & Lucien:”He hadn’t mentioned Elain, or his proximity to her. Elaine had not asked him to stay, or to go. And whether she cared about the bruises on his face, she certainly hadn’t let on.”So if you already put away your pitchforks and torches, guess now is the right time to draw them out again, because this isn’t going to be nice and tell you what: I actually don’t care! I’ll say it as it is: I HATE Elain! There, I said it! And I’m not even sorry for it! You think Nesta is a witch? Oh well, guess Elain is even worse because she hides it behind her super sweet appearance and gentle actions. By now I’ve reached a point where I despise her and I’m sick and tired of everyone defending this woman just because she is so sweet! Where was Elain when Feyre was taken by Tam? What did Elain do when Feyre went out hunting for them? Nesta might be a witch, and I can’t even believe I’m saying this, but at least she went looking for Feyre. What did Elain do? She got engaged to Grayson! YAY! Way to go! Also everyone loving precious and dear Elain! WTF?!!! Did Elain ever do anything except of looking lovely?! (Yes, she might be a great cook and good at gardening but seriously is that all!???!!!) AND WHY THE FREAKING HELL IS EVERYONE DEFENDING ELAIN WITH THE WORDS “Elain is Elain”!??? ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?? WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN!!?? I’m sick and tired of her getting away with everything because she’s everybody’s darling! Lucien deserves so much better than that! She can’t even talk to him for a few minutes? She can’t even thank him for the present he got her? Where was her present for him?! And just for the record: LUCIEN DIDN’T WANT HER TO BE HIS MATE!!! He’s as innocent when it comes to their mating bond as Elain! It’s not his fault that they are mates and people better remember this when they judge him for trying to get to know her! She doesn’t even give him a chance to get to know her so she’s just cruel and mean in my eyes. If she doesn’t change her attitude in the next trilogy I’ll never ship her with anyone. Not even Az. No one! For all I care she can live with her precious flowers and become one of them! GRRRRRRR!!!! AKDFASDFJASLDFJKASDFLK! Okay, I’m fine now. XD”Elain, at least, would be too polite to send Lucien away when he wanted to help. She was too polite to send him away on a normal day. She just ignored him or barely spoke to him until he got the hint and left.”Those doe-brown eyes turned toward me. Sharper than I’d ever seen them. “And that entitles him to my time, my affections?”“No.” I blinked. “But he is a good male.” Despite our harsh words. Despite this Band of Exiles bullshit. “He cares for you.”“He doesn’t know me.”“You don’t give him the chance to even try to do so.”Cassian & Nesta:”A storm is going to hit in a few days. I’d like you to distribute this amongst those who might feel its impact the hardest.”Cassian is so, so damn precious and he’s stuck with Nesta! That’s not fair! I think when it comes to me disliking characters in this series it’s a tie between Nesta and Elain. I just hate them both. (I know I’m making a lot of friends with this review. *lol* But I just can’t help it!) I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to ship them but after seeing that Nesta still didn’t change... Well, I just can’t ship them. By now I don’t even know if her character can be redeemed and if Sarah doesn’t work her magic with her I’ll never board this ship. And it will take a HUGE amount of magic to make her character at least a little bit more likable! And to everyone out there who likes Nesta and thinks I’m mean: I know she has PTSD too and I know that she suffers at least as much as all the other characters around her do, but that’s no reason to lash out at the others. If she wants to be secluded from them, live in a cheap apartment, drink all day and sleep with every fae male that comes her way: Okay! But to hurt the others, to fight them even though they are trying to help her, to spend Feyre’s and Rhys money without asking them: That’s not okay!! How many people have to offer her help until she accepts it? How often will she hurt poor Cassian because she’s just too proud to acknowledge that she has a serious problem? Just like Lucien, Cassian deserves so much better than her and I think I’ll make a petition for both of them! #FreeCassian&LucienFromTheClutchesOfTheCruelArcheronSisters”Nesta is Nesta. She does what she wants, even if it kills her sister. I’ve offered her job after job, and she refuses them all.”Tamlin & Rhys:Forgiveness could be a gift to both, but what he’d done... “Do you want her to?”His green eyes were empty. “Do I deserve it?”No. Never.He must have read it on my face, because he asked, “Do you forgive me – for your mother and sister?”I’m not okay with the way Rhys treated Tamlin! Yes, he made mistakes, yes he hurt Feyre, but that doesn’t mean that they have to hurt him too! Rhys should have known better than that, he should have been better than that and he shouldn’t have kicked Tam when he was already on the ground. Everyone can see that Tamlin is hurting and to treat him like that? To say what Rhys said to him? WOAH!! That was just cruel, mean and uncalled-for. I’m feeling really sorry for Tam now and Rhys helping him with the elk doesn’t make this any better. He only helped him because he might need him in future, not because he actually cared. Where is your compassion for Tam, Rhys? Where is the Rhys of ACOMAF I fell in love with? I don’t see him anymore. *shakes head*”I hope you live the rest of your miserable life alone here. It’s a far more satisfying end than slaughtering you.”Elain & Az:Cassian sat up, the portrait of outrage. “No?”Azriel tucked in his wings. “Would you want people betting on you?”I think the only reason Az reacted like that is because he might feel guilty for liking Elain. It’s so obvious that Sarah wants them to end up together and all those little tense moments between them speak volumes about her intentions. But as I said: I can’t ship Elain with anyone right now. Az is too sweet and gentle to end up with her and I really don’t want them to be together. Not because I would begrudge him a relationship with her, but because I think that he deserves better than her. After Mor played with him for centuries Az deserves the world, and then some! If Elain doesn’t change and acknowledges her misbehaviour against Lucien then I can’t ship this ship. And quite honestly, if I’d be Az I wouldn’t want to be with someone who treats their mate like that.”Azriel emerged from the sitting room, a glass of wine in hand and wings tucked back to reveal his fine, yet simple black jacket and pants.I felt, more than saw, my sister go still as he approached. Her throat bobbed.”Rhys & Lucien:”I can let go of the taunts,” he said, scanning my face. “And the fact that he still harbors some hope of one day reuniting with Tamlin. But I cannot let go of how he treated you after Under the Mountain.”I’m just glad that Lucien became friends with Vassa and Jurian because as I already mentioned above, he obviously isn’t welcome at the Night Court. Rhys still doesn’t like him and Lucien deserves more than to be tolerated. He deserves to be respected, to be loved and cherished and not to be treated like sh*t! Also what the hell does Rhys even mean with how he treated Feyre after Under the Mountain? Lucien did nothing wrong, he was there for her, tried to help her, defended her against Tam, spoke up for her and confronted Tamlin. And what did he get in return? Tamlin reprimanded him and might have even physically hurt him, Ianthe abused him and Tam let it happen because he refused to take part in the ritual, and Feyre?! Do I really have to point out what Feyre did? She lied to him, claimed that Rhys had turned her and even after she came back to the spring court she continued to lie to him and hurt him even more by destroying the only place he called home. Hell, she even used him to antagonize Tam and to destroy his friendship with Lucien. A great friend she was to him! And this after everything he did for her Under the Mountain. Hell, he even got whipped because he helped her and almost died as well. To destroy your friends’ life is a great way to show him gratitude. Well done, Feyre! So WHO EXACTLY TREATED WHOM LIKE SH*T AFTER UNDER THE MOUNTAIN, RHYS???!!!! Mhmm??? Care to enlighten me? And one more thing before I come to the end of thisrantreview: Lucien was in no position to help Feyre because he suffered from PTSD too. That’s something everyone always seems to forget. You can’t help someone else if you’re drowning yourself. And people better keep that in mind before they talk badly about him.Conclusion:I really thought I’d enjoy this novella and then move on to the next trilogy but for some reason those 229 pages kinda irked me. Big time. *lol* I guess that’s mostly due to the fact that all the things I already criticized in ACOWAR seemed to be even more prominent in this short story and I just couldn’t ignore it any longer. Also all the chapters we got from Mor’s POV didn’t contribute anything to the story, which is the main reason I didn’t even mention her in my review. All told this was a nice addition to the first trilogy and a good segue into the next one and I really hope that Sarah J. Maas will tackle all those issues I just pointed out. After all, “Hope dies last”! ;-PThis fanart was made by:https://twitter.com/Niruskyart'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '✨Hardcore SJM fans need not engage, kindly move along without reading this review.✨Me after finishing the book:IM FREEEEEE!!!!!!!! WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY FUCKING LIFESo let’s start by sayingthis book wasalmostentirely useless.Things this book has:• lots of walking around Velaris• shopping for presents• lots of bad innuendos• me physically rolling my eyes every two pages• way too much internal monologue about who had fucked whom, where and in which position• one really long and really cringy sex scene•somehow galaxies were involved in the sex scene and that’s not even the weirdest thing that’s ever happened in a sjm sex scene• mate mate mate mate mate m a t e ma te ma t e mat e m ate mAtE mATe MATE matE M a te• ""gentlemales""• I repeat:g e n t l e m a l e s• a few cute moments• a few funny moments•a tiny bit of actual fucking foundation for the next booksBasicallyFeyre and Rhys need to retireand let secondary characters finally have the spotlight.* The only POVs I genuinely enjoyed were Cassian’s and Nesta’s, which, surprise surprise, will be the focus of the next book. Fucking finally.*except SJM has a talent for ruining main characters so what happens when secondary characters become the main ones? Uhhh we shall find out I guess.Speaking more generally,this book was just mostly bad.I’m not only talking aboutthe writing, whichneeded a lot of editing, but the general feeling surrounding it all. Starting from the blurb, which is just a few sentences from the first chapter copypasted together. People, the blurb doesn’t even make sense. That extra sentence about snow? It shouldn’t be there. They obviously needed one more sentence to make the blurb longer and didn’t know what else to pick. It’s just bad. Whoever did that did a very poor job.* And that makes me angry.*EDIT: oh boy they changed the blurb!!! More than a full week after the book released! But I got receipts. #NeverForgetTheBlurbAuthors, even big ones, still have to fight hard to see their books picked up by publishers, be sold, and then be read and hyped by readers. But apparently that rule doesn’t apply to SJM.The publisher doesn’t even put any effort in pre-release things like writing a decent blurb, because they know her books are going to sell anyway. And I mean, I’m here writing this review because I’ve read this book despite swearing that I was done with this series after ACOWAR, because she has a talent for making you want to know what happens to the characters, even if (especially if) they’re not the main ones.But the least the author and the publisher could do is put some fucking effort and deliver a product that’s better than this. Instead, it feels likeeither SJM is a rare case of writer who gets worse every book she writes, or the publisher has decided that she’s still going to sell regardless how many rounds of editing her books get,so they might as well never edit them, thus never delivering a polished book.Because, folks, we might have started making fun of the wordm*tefor shits and giggles, but it’s become a big fucking problem, especially in this book. You know the writing advice that says to just use someone’s name when talking about them, instead of saying, idk, “the French girl,” or “the red-haired boy”? SJM has never heard of it. Think about your own internal monologue. Do you think of your spouse as “my spouse” all the time? Or do you simply think about them with their name?Cassian and my mate’s sister did not speak to each other at all.This sentence just does not flow. And it’s just one of about 70 times the word m*te was used (and keep in mind this is a 200 pages book).I wonder how many creative writing students failed their assignments for doing exactly what the most hyped YA fantasy author these days does constantly.Do we also want to have The Talk about theweird connotations and implicationsthat this word has? Oh boy, this conversation is about three years late, but I absolutely Do Not like all this animalistic shit, starting with m*te, moving on to how many times people purr, referring to people as males and females (ah, the good ol’ binary) (YES I FUCKING KNOW SHE CAN’T CALL THEM MEN AND WOMEN BUT JFC JUST STOP), to the weird possessiveness that the whole m*ting system entails. Also!!! Toxic masculinity!!!!!!! Weird unchallenged sexist comments!!!!! Trying to make Rhys sound soooo feminist when apparently his job is being horny 24/7!!!!!! Have Rhys (a literal sexual abuse victim) talk about how hecan’t standto be next to his m*te without, and I quote, BEING BURIED INSIDE HER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ohhhh now you\'ve done it, you got me mad. If you read a SJM book it seems like thinking/talking/having sex for most part of your day is the normalcy. Which it can be!!!! But guess what! Ace people exist!!!! People with low sexual drive exist!!!!!!!!!! That’s normal too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh no I’m using too many exclamation points let me hire an editor. When every single character you portray acts the same exact way towards something like sex, you’re telling your readers (mostly teens) that that’s what’s expected of them, that that’s how everyone is like. It’s no secret that diversity doesn’t exist in SJM’s world, and that involves how people view sex and romantic relationships too.It’s amazing that YA books have sex positivity.But books need to also acknowledge that ace people exist too. Protagonists and love interests that aren’t some sort of sex gods need to be there too. Thin boys, fat boys, trans boys need to be there too.If after >10 books a writer can’t get out of her own self-insert fantasies about what type of men she likes, maybe she isn’t a great writer after all.Maybe she needs to listen to the (still too small) part of her readers that demand More, that demand Better.I went on a HUGE tangent and I don\'t even fucking care. There were parts of the book that I liked. I even enjoyed most of its central part. I enjoyed Nesta’s PTSD portrayal and she’s the only reason I’m going to read the next book because parts of her trauma and her way of dealing with it have the potential to mean so fucking much to me. But I’m going to lower my rating to 1 star because I’m tired of all the things I mentioned above,I\'m tired of being treated like shit by an author and her team because they expect me to worship her when she doesn\'t even try anymore.My 1 star isn\'t even gonna change anything because everyone’s giving this the usual five stars, but I don’t care. I’m here and as a readerI demand better, I demand the bare fucking minimum, and I don’t think this book even tried.This was a buddy read withmy bon m@te(I’m sorry)____Correct me if I\'m wrong but shouldn\'t blurbs, like, tell you something about the book..........why is this one just a recap of the previous ones lmaoAlso shout-out to sjm for managing to squeeze the word ""mate"" within like 100 words of bad blurb'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '#1A Court of Thorns and Roses★★★★★#2A Court of Mist and Fury★★★★★#3A Court of Wings and Ruin★★★★★#3.5A Court of Frost and Starlight★★★★★First of all, let me just express my total devastation that an entire year of counting down the days until this book’s release isgonein two and a half hours of reading. I mean, I knew it was only going to be a novella, but… *sobs quietly*I didn’t expect it to go by THAT fast!This amazing little series has pulled me through some really dark times and brought so much joy into my life that I know I will treasure it, always. ♥Even now, with that bond again flowing between us like a river of star-flecked night, the echo of its vanishing lingered.ACOFAS definitely doesn’t read anything like the 3 main novels; the chapters switch perspectives occasionally, featuring POVs from Feyre, Rhysand, Cassian, and Morrigan. What struck me as particularly odd about this was the fact that Feyre and Rhysand’s chapters were in first-person, while Cassian and Morrigan’s were in third—a slightly jarring writing style, but nothing too detrimental.In his stare, I could have sworn galaxies swirled. In the shadows between his wings, the glorious depths of the night dwelled.We do get some really sweet and domestic Feysand moments, but I was actually surprised at how little time they actually spend together during the novella (and how little sex there is—who is this author and what did she do with Sarah?!). We did finally get the infamous wall scene! There are some incredibly sweet moments, at least a few scenes of Rhysand being his lovable cinnamon roll self, and a completely expected but adorable turn of events for their little family.Shadows different from anything my powers summoned, spoke to. Born in a lightless, airless prison meant to break him. Instead, he had learned its language.Feysand obsession aside, I loved how much time we got to spend with Cass and Az, learning more about their respective histories and how they’ve healed from the war. With Cassian’s perspectives especially, it felt like this was written to be a legitimate “bridge” between the ACOTAR series and whatever comes next, which I was honestly fond of, even if the next book’s focus on Cassian and Nesta does have me pretty nervous.Lucien had not come here to make amends during Solstice, I realized as Tamlin opened the door to the dark library. Lucien had come here out of pity. Mercy.Perhaps the most unexpected bits were the ones in which we visited Tamlin—with a novella this short, I honestly didn’t expect to see him at all, and certainly not in the state in which Rhysand found him. I never thought I would feel sorry for him, and I still think he’s a walking, talking garbage can, but I still couldn’t help being at least a little bit sad to see how far he’s fallen. I truly do hope that Sarah will write more about him in the future, because I can’t help but always feel that, no matter what a jerk he is, there’s something interesting about his potential as a character.Cassian set me down at last. “What’d you get me for Solstice?” I smacked his arm. “A heaping pile of shut the hell up.”Was ACOFAS everything I hoped and dreamed it would be? Honestly, no. This is more of a 4.5 rating, but you can believe that I did not hesitate to round up to 5 stars, because at the end of the day, I got to spend a few hundred pages with my precious bat babies, and watch this adorable little family interact and taunt and fuss and cry and laugh with one another, and that was all I reallyneededthis novella to offer me. I have missed the inner court so damn much since ACOWAR ended, and it just felt SO GOOD to fall right back into this world for a little bit longer. ♥Bonus list of tiny things that made me squeal:→ the sauna scene→ snowball fight traditions→ more “the power of art” scenes→ Morrigan reminiscing (ow, my heart)→ Amren’s newfound jigsaw puzzle obsession→ “Illyrian babies”→ Rhys cooking Tamlin dinner, like… what even?→ all the fuzzy scarves and winter holiday vibes→ Amren receiving a million pieces of jewelry as always→ Mor’s terrible taste in gifts→ SHAMELESS reference to Cass’ wingspanYou can find this review and more on myblog, or you can follow me ontwitter,bookstagram, orfacebook!'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Just published my latestBookTube Video- so excited to share it!!The Written Review*cue the undiluted screams of joy*Okay. Okay. I willtryto be objective about this one but I just finished ACOWAR and I am still riding that emotional high.To summarize:for a companion novel - not bad at all. It's full ofcotton-candy fluff,and I devoured every single bite.Now, this one was a bitheavy on the smutand a bit light on the Nessian but it definitely hadall the right feelsin all the right places.Stars flickered around us, sweet darkness sweeping in. As if we were the only souls in a galaxy.For those who don't know (and are curious) this novel sprang from avery drunk conversationbetween Sarah J. Maas (aka the Maaster) and her publisher.Maas confessed that in her free time that she wrote fanfiction of her work. Just little drabbles of what happened in between ACOWAR and her next novel. The publisher thought,we could sell that...And thus, this novel was born.So, keeping the origins in mind,I really liked this novel.There wasn't a big-bad or end-of-the-world subplot, not much plot development happened BUT this was afun and lightheartedread.And honestly, after ACOWAR, these charactersdeservea fewmonthsyears off from the doom-and-gloom.“Dangerous words, Rhysand,” Amren warned, strutting through the door, nearly swallowed up by the enormous white fur coat she wore. Only her chin-length dark hair and solid silver eyes were visible above the collar. She looked—“You look like an angry snowball,” Cassian said.Feyre and friends are spending theirfirst winter solstice(aka Christmas without Christ) together. And despite the warmth of the hearth, not all of the winter chill is kept out.Feyre frets aboutreuniting her family.Rhysand freaksout about what to buy her (Solstice and birthday presents!!).Mor isabsolutely terribleat expressing her feelings (and gift-giving in general).And Amren makes outlike a bandit(mostly cause everyone knows what to buy her - priceless jewels).And, of course,Nesta being Nestamade this novel shine.Every time she and Cassian are in the same room the dynamic between them is just perfect.He'd seen Nesta in that particular pose, too. He called it her I Will Slay My Enemies pose.Cassian had named about two dozen poses for Nesta at this point. Ranging from I Will Eat Your Eyes for Breakfast to I Don't Want Cassian to Know I'm Reading Smut. The latter was his particular favorite.I know this is just a companion novel and that there won't be much development in terms of relationships but c'mon Sarah J. Maas.Throw us a bone.(Actually, if you read the sneak peek at book 4 included at the end, I suppose she does offer us a bit of relationship hints).I am soemotionally investedin this series right now. I wish I could just time-machine myself into next year for book 4. But until I get that working, this companion novel will certainly tide me over.P.s.

But if you read this just as an epilogue to the ACOTAR trilogy, it\'s just pointless and cringy fan service. If I have to read the words ""illyrian babies"" one more time it will actually induce vomiting.-----Original review, May 2018:we were all played like a violin in investing in this book. It’s $18 for lazy, messy fanfiction. This is 200+ pages of complete emptiness. There’s no purpose to any of this other than a money grab and longwinded, unnecessary epilogue to the original trilogy.This literally reads like someone from Tumblr wanted a scene with all the ACOTAR characters having christmas together so sarah whipped out her laptop. There was no substance or set-up to a new series at all. 90% of this book—and I wish I was kidding—is just the characters all going shopping for each other\'s presents--multiple times. The other 10% is Feyre and Rhys speaking in each other’s heads through the bond about how much they want to fuck each other. Additional scenes include the characters getting drunk every 30 pages, weird side POVs from characters who add nothing to the story, and a snowball fight between warriors. I honest to God am not joking when I say if I read this on fanfiction.net, I would laugh at it and say it’s unrealistic and poorly done. It’s just pure stupidity and vapid smut for the fans’ wish fulfillment.The writing in this is so messy. “Gentlemales” brought me to a depth of hell I haven’t seen before, so thanks for that, Sarah. Every time a female character says something “softly, but not weakly,” I feel like plunging a knife into my chest. Take a shot every time Sarah’s written that into one of her books. The sex scenes have so much potential to be steamy or whatever but Sarah ruins it by having the characters CONSTANTLY horny for each other, so it dampens any tension or angst. And the amount of times that sex is referenced in Rhys’s POV is utterly repulsive. At one point he justlooksat a table and is like “mmm I’d fuck Feyre on that” ... [john mulaney voice] FUCKING WHAT?? Even in Feyre’s POV when I could get away from his gross thoughts, he’d always talk shit to her down the bond and try and get in her pants or say something “sexy” but it’s just so corny and stupid and gross and it ruins the scene and I wanted to throw my book it was so irritating.I just think it’s funny how Feyre is the high lady and in Velaris, apparently women—oh, i’m sorry, FEMALES—are toootally equal to men *ahhem* males, and yet this entire book, Rhys is traveling to different courts and talking treaties and strategies with people and going off on business and Feyre does what? Cleans their home, goes shopping (no less than 4 times), cooks meals, and maybe if she’s feeling frisky, paints a little or has sex with her husband—oh, i’m sorry *ahhem*mate…. Sarah, don’t pretend that women are so equal to men but then literally only have female characters who love jewels and shopping and cooking and serving men and having sex. Even Amren didn’t slit a throat in this—she just complained about pooping and then had sex with Varian. Nesta and Lucien are the only vaguely interesting characters in this and I don’t like either of them. Their anger and distance made them more interesting than the characters in this getting shit-faced, making lame sexual jokes to each other, and referencing characters from the original trilogy I don’t care about.I wanted there to be something good about this because I genuinely loved ACOMAF and I’m waiting to feel a glimpse of the mastery that went into that book, but these new books just fan wish fulfillment at this point. This book was COMPLETELY unnecessary and the fact that Sarah is only extending the world to exploit the characters people like and get more money is just low. Let this series die, the world is done.

Not in the slightest.Granted, this is all opinion based; there\'s nothing inherently wrong with this book, I just found myself bored from beginning to end. In fact, I felt like the chapter excerpt for book #4 in the back had more to offer than this entire ""novella"" provided in 220+ pages. If you loved this one, I truly am happy for you, but I felt the need to provide some honest feedback in case there are others who may have the same expectations that I did here. I\'m going to keep this as spoiler free as possible, but if you haven\'t read the previous books in the series I would stop here.********************I\'m actually having trouble writing anything about the plot because nothing really happens in the story, aside from one decision that is made between Feyre and Rhysand. I did appreciate that the author was trying to offer a brief entrance back into the world she had created, and if this had been the beginning to a larger, 700+ page novel then I would have looked at this in a completely different light. I hate that I was expecting something to happen because it detracted from my ability to just enjoy being with these characters again as they shop for presents for each other and describe the food they are eating and recap everything we just read in the previous novel. But truly, if all you are looking for is atmosphere then you will likely enjoy this much more than I did. The descriptions of Velaris and the Illyrian war camps are breathtaking and exquisite.I did wholly appreciate the bit of backstory we get into Cassian initially, and my heart bled for Mor as she kept having to deal with her father and Eris and the Court of Nightmares, but every time I thought we were finally getting somewhere it would switch back over to shopping and food discussions. So I have to give credit to the fact that I was engaged in those moments, regardless of how the flow affected my absorption of the story. I was so disappointed in this disjointed lack of connection that I couldn\'t believe I was reading about the same inner circle I had once held so dear.Have I possible ""outgrown"" this series? I would hope not, because it\'s one of my favorite escapes, so I\'ve come to the conclusion that a big factor is this:I\'m tired of Feyre and Rhysand.It\'s not like I never want to hear about them, but I am so done with their narrative. It has come to the point where it feels repetitive and stale and dull and every single other character in this book, aside from a little bit of Cassian/Mor/Nesta was mostly left out. I wanted to hear more from all these other characters, from other courts spread across the continent, fromANYTHING BUT FEYRE AND RHYS.You know what I think the strongest point this novella has going for it?SJM actually made me feel a bit of conflicted sorrow for Tam Tam.I will never excuse abuse or the things he did wrong previously, but she managed to touch a tiny place inside my heart that wished for more for ole Tammy, that he could find someone to accept his brokenness and help heal him into a functioning member of fae society.I\'m sorry as I\'m completely aware that this review is just a bundle of disjointed thoughts (how\'s that for irony?), but it\'s the best I could do under the circumstances. Guys, I\'ll still read the next book, as I\'m interested in the Nesta/Cassian deal, but I sincerely hope that we see more Elain/Lucien/Azriel, because I missed my precious babies. I really did.Ok, NOW you can throw your pitchforks and knives at me, I\'m done!;)'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Rereading this again filled me up with all kinds of warmth and goodness.

Her books have brought about this sense of utter calm and happiness within me every time I read and think about them.This novella was everything we needed to potentially see the direction the other books will go in. And boy, am I beyond excited for it!I'm sure we'll be getting more of Cassian and Nesta in the next book and Sarah J Maas does character development ridiculously well and my god, being able to look forward and dream about their character exploration makes me too excited for words.I loved that we got see more of the Inner Circle. They are, hands down, my favourite bunch of fictional characters. I feel like I'm part of the family. I'm so glad some lighthearted, happy and sweet, tender moments were included in this. The family aspect between them all felt too real, and so good to read. And so worthy of them to have after the events of ACOWAR.And the emphasis on art in this book and seeing Feyre getting back into it as a form of healing for herself and others was a dream. Her dreams were finally actualised.The progression from ACOWAR to this felt natural and the cities and its people (including our main lot) were still healing, still too traumatised from the war. But progress was being made and I can't wait to see how that will be looked at in the upcoming spin-off series.I think at this point people are more interested in the progression of other characters.

I know many people weren\'t happy about getting another book about them but they still hold a special place in my heart soa new whole canon book about them?It felt like Christmas morning for me lol.Besides that, from my point of view the book is more aboutseeing the inner circle heal after the warthan feysand. Some dealt with it better than others but everyone has its own scars.I loved seeingthe progression of Feyre and Rhysand\'s relationship,they\'re my all time favorite fictional couple and seeing them happy and making plans for the future was amazing, after everything they went through they deserve it and no one can convince me otherwise. Plus, it was good to seeold Rhyscoming back, he was kind of less funny and flirty in acowar (understandably).It\'s true,the plot was basically non existent but I mean ... uhm what were you expecting?I lost count of how many times Sarah said the whole book\'s purpose was giving a deserved ending to the feysand arc and creating a bridge between the two series. That\'s exactly what she did so I don\'t get the amount of hate I\'m reading about this topic.Plus, the final excerpt confirmed thatthe next book is gonna be nessian\'sand I liked how Sarah set up the two of them (especially Nesta, her story arc in acofas is soooo dark).

EXPLICIT SEX SCENES of heroine with both love interests: winner RhysandBook 3: NO LOVE TRIANGLE!Feyre and Rhys remain together, but there are other love triangles around and Rhys proposes a Male-Male-Female threesome to Feyre. Maybe he was joking, either way her reaction was unnecessarily enthusiastic for a woman who has already been sexually involved with 3 different men in the series and who is basically a newlywed. FeyRhys is still in their honeymoon period so why are they already joking about threesomes?♣ IF YOU DON\'T LIKE ABUSIVE LOVE INTERESTS AND ABUSIVE WOMEN-Tamlin love interest of book 1? ABUSIVE!-Rhys, secondary love interest of book 1 andprimary love interest of books 2 and 3? Rhys tortured the heroine(there was a reason, though)ABUSIVE!- The sisters? Everyone talks about how Tamlin should apologize. When will the sisters apologize?Feyre\'s elder sisters let Feyre hunt for the family from a very early age, but they were always there reaping the benefits of Feyre\'s effort. When Feyre was going through an abusive relationship they kept receiving money from Feyre\'s abuser and didn\'t bother to find out how she wasABUSIVE!♣IF YOU DON\'T LIKE WHEN sexual assault victims ARE THROWN UNDER THE BUS TO MOVE THE PLOT FORWARD. CAREFUL WITH DANGEROUS RAPE MESSAGESIt happens so much on New adult and adult literature (game of thrones, the girl with the dragon tatoo, the second book of the outlander series) a sexual assault victim gets the ""oh-you-were-raped?- don\'t- bitch- about- it- and- move- forward treatment. So many books trivialize the worst aspect of PTSD and sexual assault and try to ""sovle it"" either with revenge or the magic romantic relationship that will make everything go away. Or the experiences just get ignored and brush aside! This happens to Mor, a secondary character in the 3rd book who is a rape survivor whenshe\'s forced to work along with her attacker and the one who puts her through that was the hero of the story!To be fair, I can understand the circumstances, doesn\'t mean I have to like that kind of story line, especially when that\'s something that good editing could have taken care of. That kind of disrespect for rape was unneccessary IMO. It didn\'t move the plot forward and it\'s out of character for Rhys to act like that. I love Rhys and didn\'t like the way SJM made him act.♣ IF YOU BELIEVE ANY BOOK YOU PAY FOR SHOULD BE PROFESSIONALLY EDITEDI\'m not a grammar nazi and my spelling is terrible, but I can tell you, even some fanfiction I\'ve read has a more polished editing than this book. There\'s the overuse of words like mate. There are also problems with pace, repetitiveness, flow and consistency of the voices when changing from a narrator to the other and from a first person POV to a 3rd person POV. The characters sound too modern. The worldbuilding is not high fantasy at all. The setting of this series is pretty much like a modern series. All these are things that a content editor and a proofreader could have taken care off, but the publishers rushed publication lowering the quality of the editing and the writing. Even so they are selling this at full ebook price.My ratings for the series so far♣A Court of Thorns and Roses ACOTAR 3/5because abusive relationships, false advertising (it\'s new adult dishonestly marketed as young adult) and love triangle. My review is currently censored and hidden from the third page of review. It should appear somewhere between page 2 and 3.♣A COURT OF MIST AND FURY ACOMAF4/5 because I didn\'t appreciate the explicit sex scene with OM, but I highly recommend this book to my friends who don\'t mind safety issues and like explicit scenes in slow-burn-romance. This book is EROTICA (according to the goodreads description of the genre) marketed as YA.♣A COURT OF WINGS AND RUIN ACOWAR2.5/5 because poor editing, f bombs, repetitiveness, unnecessary sex scenes and dangerous messages. No, glorifying revenge and abusive women isn\'t female empowerment. No, in most marriage it isn\'t always the woman\'s choice, it\'s always the choice of both of them.

It could be unintentionally. It could be intentionally. The reason doesn\'t matter. They\'re contributing to the false advertising.A fewbooktubers are being published or aspire to be published by the same IMPRINT of this new adult series. Others booktubers and bookbloggers seem to want good relationships with the publishing industry. They won\'t say anything that can hurt the marketing agenda of the big publishing houses.Note: Bookables, Benji Alderson and Polandbananas have mentioned this series is new adult , so of course a lot of booktubers are somehow honest, it\'s not cool calling out an entire community of readers because the dishonesty of a few bad apples. Distrust only the reviewers who call this series young adult.On the other hand, The Goodreads choice awards editors ignored the shelving system when they selected the categories for the goodreads choice awards last year. In the goodreads feedback group they told me that\'s how editors select categories: based on shelving.At the time of the awards this series was shelved primarily asfantasy and romanceby GR users, but still the editors made it compete on the young adult category. Not in romance (second most-shelved genre), not in fantasy (first most-shelved genre). They made it compete in young adult (third most-shelved genre followed closely by New adult)This review isn\'t meant to discouraging people from reading/buying the book. On the contrary. I\'m inviting you to read this series if you don\'t have problems with sexual content and abusive relationships.Despite all the problems I have with the false advertising I enjoyed the trilogy. But again I\'m warning you:♣ NEVER trust the information that you see on Goodreads, Common sense media. and booktube. Not all reviewers are independent and unbiased. Do your research.Life is too short and TBR piles are too big to just ignore the kind of information that can help us decide what we will read next. Goodreads shouldn\'t try to hide that information.People who pay $15-18 for a hardcover and $8-15 for an ebook of a young adult ""high fantas"" book have every right to expect:♣ 12-18 YO Main characters,♣ no F bombs♣ no explicit sex.♣ A profesionally edited book.That\'s not what any book of this series delivers.Update 02-24People aren\'t expecting something like this:For a series that is supposedly about women\'s choices,when Goodreads, Booktubers and Publishers hide this information from young girls they are taking away their right to decide when or if they would read erotic content.

This is the equivalent of a fluffy fanfic with no plot. Honestly, the plot of this series wasn\'t great in the first place, so ACOFAS is basically what happens when SJM makes the good decision to scrap the plot and just focus on the part I actually care about - the characters.This novella is infamous for, uh...My reviews are rated G, thank you very much.Let\'s just say... stuff happened in the sky.I had nearly sent us crashing into the rooftops like an Illyrian whelp.If you listen carefully, you can hear my wheezing.But that\'s not the main problem I had with this, even though it was, well - a littlestrange.I hate the treatment of Tamlin.I hate it so much.In case you somehow have no idea what Tamlin did in ACOMAF, here\'s a summary.He locked Feyre in the house and emotionally abused her. It was bad.But Rhys was such a jerk about it when it wasFeyre\'sresponsibility to talk to him.Rhys just assumed that what he said was what Feyre wanted. He was needlessly cruel to someone who was suffering from PTSD.Tamlin\'s mental illness doesn\'t give him an excuse, obviously, but I\'m still angry that Tamlin didn\'t get the help he needed. He was traumatized, scarred; but everyone focused on Feyre, leaving him to become the person he is now - broken, depressed, scared. Believing he is only worthy of hate.Look at how jerky Rhys the Beast is being literally after Tamlin saved his life:No, Tamlin deserved what he\'d brought upon himself, this husk of a life. He deserved every empty room, every snarl of thorns, every meal he had to hunt for himself.That makes me sad. That actually makes me physically upset. No one deserves that. No one. And it\'s not even Rhys\'s place to say this stuff to Tamlin:""You deserve everything that has befallen you. You deserve this pathetic, empty house, your ravaged lands. I don\'t care if you offered that kernel of life to save me, I don\'t care if you still love my mate. I don\'t care that you saved her from Hybern, or a thousand enemies before that.I hope you live the rest of your miserable life alone here.""WHOA.CALM DOWN.Look at how depressed poor Tammy is:Tamlin didn\'t have shields around the house. None to prevent anyone from winnowing in, to guard against enemies appearing in his bedroom and slitting his throat.It was almost as if he was waiting for someone to do it.Let\'s be clear - I don\'t like Tamlin. He\'s a manipulative jerk. But he needs help. He clearly needs someone to take care of him like Rhys did for Feyre in ACOMAF. And he was not given that, so everyone hates him because of it.This also ruined Lucien\'s life. Now he\'s not welcome anywhere. And he says it like it is:""You can be as much of an asshole as that mate of yours, you know that?""I mean, he\'s not wrong.My other big complaint with this novella is the random ""feminist"" stuff that\'s thrown in so awkwardly? We get it, males can cook and clean. It\'s not that revolutionary. It should have been incorporated better into the story, rather than stated outright....cooking, cleaning, child-rearing, clothes-making... There was honor in such tasks - pride and good work to be found in them. But not when every single one of the females here was expected to do it... Traditions going back thousands of years, left mostly unchallenged.Until us. Until now.Rhysand is such a Feminist King™I appreciate what this is trying to do, but it\'s so cheesy that... I really can\'t, I\'m sorry.""The boys can help decorate, clean, and cook. They\'ve got two hands.""Wow, Cassian\'s a Feminist King™ too.Added to the random tragic backstories that strangers confessed to Feyre at the oddest times, this novella felt rather weak.Oh, yes, they wererandomall right.""My husband didn\'t return from the war.""Miss Girl, Feyre does not know you.Oh, and here was an absolutely stunning analogy that just... shook me to the core.This same random weaver person had a tapestry and she explained that the black thread was called the Void and that the white thread was called Hope. And then...""If I were to stop, if I were to let this loom or the spindle go silent... Then there would be no Hope shining in the Void.""Wow, so the Hope thread symbolizes hope and the Void thread symbolizes emptiness!!!Speaking of on-the-nose, Feyre has a weird relationship with money. As she reminds us, over and over and over again:The sums we allocated were sizable, more money than I\'d ever dreamed of possessing.This would be okay if it were only said once. But no.It didn\'t feel real, those numbers and figures. Like it was children\'s play money. I only bought what I needed.She says this so. many. times. Basically every time she buys something.Decadent - it felt decadent, and selfish, to shop.I didn\'t like how the side characters developed (besides Nesta, her trauma was just haunting). No one forgives Nesta for making Feyre hunt before Prythian, and yet everyone forgives Elain when she did the same thing. It doesn\'t make sense. There\'s no explanation.""You still can barely talk to Nesta,"" I said. ""Yet Elain you can talk to nicely.""""Elain is Elain.""""If you blame one, you have to blame the other.""""No, I don\'t. Elain is Elain.""What kind of explanation is that? ""Elain is Elain."" And? Are we supposed to forgiveherinstead of Nesta because she\'s so gentle and kind and sweet and blah blah blah? I don\'t think so.My theory is that Elain is not actually nice. She only speaks maybe 2-5 times during this novella, and most of the time, she\'s speaking coldly. Everyone is surprised, but... This is just how she is. She takes advantage of her family and friends thinking she\'s weak and needs protecting. But she\'s actually just a colder person than Nesta.Elain\'s voice was colder than usual.I\'d never heard Elain\'s voice so cold.Also, what is Feyre painting? No one knows. This entire novella is about her painting and I literally still don\'t know what she\'s painting.""What sort of things do you paint?""""The things that need telling.""How very descriptive.I painted and painted and painted.I painted until my back cramped... I\'d known what needed to come out of me the moment I perched on the rickety stool...But it began to emerge. Began to take form.I lowered my brush and stared at what I\'d created.Me.Or how I\'d been in the Ouroboros, that beast of scale and claw and darkness; rage and joy and cold. All of me. What lurked beneath my skin.But...But what is it??I painted through the grief that lingered at the weaver\'s story, painted for her loss. I painted all that rose within me, letting the past bleed onto the canvas, a blessed relief with each stroke of my brush.I still don\'t know.I hadn\'t any idea what to get them, other than this. The [paintings] I\'d worked on recently - glimpses of their stories. None of them explained what the paintings meant, what they beheld.Imagine knowing what Feyre is painting.For on that painting I\'d shown him what I had not revealed to anyone. The creature inside myself, the creature full of hate and regret and love and sacrifice, the creature that could be cruel and brave, sorrowful and joyous.I\'ll leave you with that mystery to figure out. If anyone knows what Feyre\'s painting, tell me and I will thank you profusely.1.5 stars; the word ""mate"" was used 71 times. this is not Australia, thank you'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3/5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️“Stars flickered around us, sweet darkness sweeping in. As if we were the only souls in a galaxy.”I\'m sorry. I\'m so fucking sorry.THIS BOOK FUCKING KILLED ME WITH BOREDOM. I swear to God, I\'m dead now. My ghost is writing this review. I\'m fucking dead because this book had no point in even existing. This book isn\'t even filler. It\'s nothing. I can\'t even describe it. This book was SUPPOSED to be the bridge between the old series and the new series. But like??? This book was just messy archiveofourown.org fanfiction. And not a good one. Not one I would give kudos to or write a comment under. One I wouldn\'t read at all. But now let\'s go to the summary of the book, which is also inadequate.Feyre, Rhys, and their close-knit circle of friends are still busy rebuilding the Night Court and the vastly-changed world beyond. But Winter Solstice is finally near, and with it, a hard-earned reprieve.Yet even the festive atmosphere can\'t keep the shadows of the past from looming. As Feyre navigates her first Winter Solstice as High Lady, she finds that those dearest to her have more wounds than she anticipated--scars that will have far-reaching impact on the future of their Court.See? Even the summary has nothing to prepare us for. As you all know, because I\'ve been raving and raving about those books for a million years, this is the series which has reintroduced me to fantasy. This series holds a very special place in my heart and I have come to loveSarah J. Maasas an author, too. This book was unlike anything she has written. This book was clearly a money grab, fanservice sort of fanfiction book. Which added almost nothing to this series. Everything that happened in this book could be included in a 30 page snippet at the beginning of the fourth book of the series, and it would all be ok. But let\'s talk specifics.The plotLet\'s talk about the non-existentPLOT. This book was: shopping with Feyre, shopping with Mor, cooking with Elain, hardcore negotiations with Rhys, Az and Cassian, some good ol\' fucking with good ol\' Feyre and Rhys, and then again shopping, and then again some fucking, and some tension featuring Nesta,ARTwith Feyre, brooding with Tamlin, sexual tension with Cassian and Nesta, and let\'s not forget the epic new single....MATES, included in the new album byFeyre ArcheronandRhysand(who still doesn\'t have a surname)M.A.T.E.S.(masturbation anal testicles ejaculation sex) (wtf was that). Let\'s be real here. Every time I read this fucking word I want to off myself. This word is ruined for me. I can never hear a dudebro call another dudebro ""mate"" and not remember this. Let this word rest. Let this word die. Let this word becomeFrost and Starlight(see what I did there). JUST LET THIS WORD GO. WE KNOW THEY\'RE MATES THEY\'RE MATED FOR LIFE THEY\'LL BE TOGETHER FOREVER AND FOREVER NAH NAH NAH. Ugh. If I had one euro (yes I\'m changing it from ""if I had a dollar"" if I had a fucking dollar I couldn\'t use it for anything) for every time the word ""mate"" is in this book, I would go to vacation to Santorini. It\'s expensive guys. You have no fucking clue how much.The POVsThis book added multiple perspectives of characters, which I found pretty interesting, but also unnecessary because nothing happens in this book and we don\'t need to see that nothing explained from multiple people, but you know, it happens. It confused me, though. We mostly see Feyre\'s and Rhys\'s POVs, in first person, and then we see some more characters\' POVs like Cassian and Mor but... in third person. Which is really unsettling and baffling. And those chapters are such heartwreching and heartbreaking moments from their past, and in this book, it feels our of place. A book about the Winter Solstice which is basically Christmas, shopping, gifts exchanging, happy times, scenes like these seem unnecessary. I couldn\'t take them seriously, and I wanted to. Also, it seems like we\'re gonna get the next series with third person narration. Which is fine by me, but what\'s the point?The romanceI\'m not a big fan of established and domestic relationships. Feyre and Rhysand literally murdered me in ACOMAF. The sexual tension, the eye fucking, the actual fucking, the ""things"" before the actual fucking, they made my little shipper heart die with happiness. And then... they became so canon, it hurts my soul. They don\'t interest me anymore. It\'s all sex and fucking and ""oh mate, my mate"" and ""oh how much I love you my Feyre"" and sky sex which was disturbing and like??? People can see you dude! You can fucking winnow and fly, just get her on a bed, or a wall (lol) or a sink or whatever floats your boat. I believe these characters\'s circle is over now. I\'m truly excited for them to have a child but I guess we\'ll see everything from another people\'s POVs now. It\'s time now forCASSIAN AND NESTA. Oh man, how much I ship this. I\'m so fucking board for this. They are my new Feyre and Rhys. I want this to happen so badly, I want to scream. Nesta pissed me off a lot in this book, but I will handle her for this ship. And because Cassian obviously loves her and I love Cassian with my entire soul. Furthermore, I don\'t know what to do with Elain, in terms of shipping. Az and Elain are cute af but I kinda want to explore the whole Elain and Lucien factor. Elain pisses me off, but I love Az and Lucien and I want to see them happy.TamlinThis book made Tamlin an unnecessary villain. It\'s like this book didn\'t have a plot or anything or someone to blame shit on so just blame it all on Tamlin. Don\'t get me wrong, I fucking hate his guts. I appreciated what he did in ACOWAR, he kinda redeemed himself, but I still don\'t like him. Nonetheless, there is no point in what\'s happening to him. Everyone is casting him out. He doesn\'t have any friends, his home is a graveyard, his people hate him. And you know, he isn\'t the worst. We\'ve seen worst villains redeem themselves. He\'s just a controlling and manipulative asshole who can\'t control his temper. He didn\'t hurt Feyre or Rhys. I want to see what will happen to his character, but Sarah has villainized him too much.The humorThis book was funny af. Hence my rating. The Amren peeing scene, the sauna scene, the ""Illyrian babies"" scene, the painting Rhys nude scene, the Feyre and Cassian drunkly decorating scene, the gifts exchange scene. It was all hilarious and fluffy and happy and it\'s something I needed. I have come to love these characters so much and I feel their inner circle as my home. I was truly happy to see them domestic and healing their wounds after the war. But, nonetheless, there was not a book needed for this. All these scenes could have been included in the fourth book. But, you know, money is important.Basically, this book was a character driven tease which gave us nothing! Honestly, we see things beginning and then we are given NOTHING. I want to know, I want to know everything. This book was diverse to anything Sarah has ever written. I was expecting this BOOM to happen but nothing. A big huge pile of shit and nothing. The book fourth snippet at the end was the most interesting part of this book. We kinda see what the next series is gonna be about. But still, not ENOUGH. Honestly, people, don\'t pay money for this book. It was too expensive for its size and importance. This is why I never read novellas and extra books to series. They mostly add nothing to the story. ANYWAY, till the next book in the A Court of Thorns and Roses series, which will be late af, K BYE!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is a great catch with the main heroes of the series. The last book was an all-out epic. This one, though a lot shorter, is still filed with SJM’s great storytelling and character development.So far, I have seen all these characters in the worst possible situations and facing incredible odds. Making great sacrifices and the legendary lengths they would go through to achieve their goals and protect those they love. Now, when they have “won”, the work of rebuilding, forgiveness, and moving on from the losses suffered.Yes there is no where near as much action in this book, and the characters are not moved along as much as I would have wanted but the are definitely important issues uncovered her that need to be explored later. This is more of “wet the appetite” for the next huge chapter, but almost as importantly a much need to assess where the characters are right now in themselves and to each other.Though Feyre and Rhysand embrace their fate together. Others rebel against a fate they have not chosen with their very souls. These are the first steps in building a new world. A great point to catch up with everyone as they set their path for the future, to forget their past, or simply (stubbornly) deny fates chosen path.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'First, technically speaking, why was this book necessary? What was the plot?Was thereeven a plot? SJM said this novella is a bridge between Feysand’s story and the next story in this world, but what exactly did it bridge?All I got from this book is anger and a gag reflex.If you’ve seen my ratings, updates, or followed me at all on here, you know I wasobsessedwith ACOMAF. It was all I talked about for about a year, from the moment I read it.I basically hated the other two books, but I loved the second one, and got so attached to feysand.But, good god, it is justnot possiblethat the person who wrote ACOMAF is the same one who wrote ACOWAR&ACOFAS. (Yes I’m hinting at a conspiracy theory).Like, ACOWAR was bad, but I still had some attachments to Feysand, even though Rhys was kind of a douche even then.But this? This wasbad.let me just saythis book is not a fantasy book. It’s a contemporary set in a different world. no fantastic elements other than flying (and even that was only mentioned for the purpose of a sex scene) were present in this book.Feyre didn’t use her powers even once. You’d think she’d use this time to practice and perfect her abilities, but no. She might as well be human.Butwhat annoyed me most about this book (and ACOWAR too tbh) is the complete regression of the characters.Feyre went back to roaming around the house doing nothing all day, Mor isstillhiding herself for no apparent reason— homophobia is not even a thing in this world and even if it were we all know the Inner Circle would accept her no matter what, so what’s the point?, Nesta went back to her old self (though I kind of get that), Amren lost all her strength and fierceness and just sits around doing jigsaw puzzles, and Rhys, oh god, Rhys. HOW IN THE WORLD is this sleazy, sex crazed douchebag supposed to be the same loving, caring, supportive Rhysand from ACOMAF? He couldn’t gotwo sentenceswithout making some unnecessary innuendos, talking about how good Feyre feels, how he can’t stand being around her without fucking her or how he dicked her in the sky while flying (???).His entire first chapter in this was him sulking and whining because he doesn’t get to fuck Feyre daily.*insert the world’s smallest violin*But putting that aside, let’s talk about how “”feminist”” he is.(I just wanna note that I know I still loved Rhys (less, but still loved him) after ACOWAR even though all those issues were present there too. It was just a little more subtle and I was still on that Feysand rush since I’d read ACOMAF only a month before. Now enough time has passed and ACOFAS has really solidified Rhys’ problematic behavior in my mind and I can see it for what it truly is.)In ACOMAF, he said [about Feyre]”My equal in every way; she would wear my crown, sit on a throne beside mine.Never sidelined, never designated to breeding and parties and child-rearing.My queen.”(page 621).And what do you know, in ACOFAS she isconstantlysidelined,andtrying for a child.In fact, the beginning of this bookreallyparallels the beginning of ACOMAF. I mean, yeah, Feyre’s in a better mental state for sure, but she still sits around the house being bored, or painting, or designing a house, while Rhysand is out there dealing with all the politics. Direct quotes from the book-”perhaps I’d use the day to organize things. Find room for everything.““High Lady of the Night Court, Defender of the Rainbow and the … Desk.”[Rhys walks in while Feyre’s in bed] “Right where I left you”... “Isn’t it all I’m good for?”Like, are you fucking kidding me? Yeah, you crowned her High Lady, but the reality is that you never involve her in anything big. You just have her clean and do some paperwork. She’s a housewife. That’ssoooofeminist of you! High Lord of the Feminist Court!Basically,Sarah J Maas made Rhys such a supporter of women in ACOMAF to make the difference between Tamlin and him even clearer, and once we all switched to Rhys’ side she figured she could just drop the act.Well, I got some news for you Sarah. It doesn’t work that way. Your readers aren’t dumb.And also, can we talk about the whole period thing? It was really cool to see such an open discussion about it in a book (no sarcasm this time) but... the idea that it makes women completely incompetent? Not so much. And that cheesy scene of him stroking her hair while she’s in pain? I almost puked.Oh and for god’s sake don’t get me started on the sisters!!!First of all- Leave! Nesta! Alone!She’s been traumatized, and she doesn’t wanna be around the Inner Circle because it’s a constant reminder of what she’d gone through. Feyre of all people should know what that feels like. But no, she keeps pressuring her and practically blackmailing her so she would come.And Cassian chasing her down her street even though she asked him to leave her alone multiple times.These people can’t respect a woman’s simple request for privacy. but hey, they have a High Lady! Yay Feminism!And I am just disgusted by how Elain is treated in this book.She is constantly pressured by Feyre to give Lucien a chance even though she repeatedly and explicitly says she’s not interested. But Feyre doesn’t let up because he’s a “good male”.Again, Feyre is such a feminist Icon!Not to mention how much Elain is belittled and ridiculed in this. She may be naive, but she’s not dumb! she’s not a child! They all (excluding Azriel, the only pure soul in this mess) keep treating and speaking to her like she’s a four year old!!!I have more thoughts but I’m so angry that I can’t even make them into a coherent sentence and this is getting too long anyway, so the bottom line is, I only care about Azriel now, but even if there’s a book about him, count me out because I’m done. I’m just done with Sarah J. Maas books.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3.5 StarsSo...I\'m not in a reviewing mood at ALL; but I figured I better lay something down here before I completely forget any thoughts I have about this book and my experience reading it.I had a hard time rating this.Because, well, it just didn\'t blow my mind.That said.While I didn\'t love it...While I didn\'t really, really, reallylikeit per se...I didappreciateit.And here\'s why.Prior to receiving my copy in the mail and, obviously, reading the book, I received Maas\' subscriber newsletter email. In it she had the usual ""woo hoo, it\'s release day"" fodder they all send out, but it also contained - what I would later discover upon finishing the book - was exactly what was depicted in the ""Acknowledgements"" section.In it, she talked about the process of writing this book and how hard it was because, in the midst of it, her father had a major health scare and almost died. Still, despite this trying time - she also found out she was pregnant - and, despite not really always ""feelin\' it,"" Maas trudged through the writing process because DEADLINE.As someone who loves to write and also lost a parent in the past, I just really empathized with the creative struggle Maas probably had here.Now, am I saying that an author\'s personal life issues should be taken into account when rating/reviewing or considering your own enjoyment of a book?Hell no.Of course not.Absolutely not.I\'m just saying that, FOR ME, reading about that just changed the mindset I started the book with.I went in knowing that, by her own admission, Maas struggled writing it.So I guess you could say that 1) lowered my expectations bar, and 2) made me read the book knowing Maas had been experiencing personal pain while writing it.And I think that emotion was definitely captured in the story.This book will NOT blow your mind.It does NOT really move the plot forward.But what it did do, in my opinion, was move the CHARACTERS forward.It really drilled down into a lot of their inner thoughts and longstanding issues and baggage and - as someone who loves character driven stories - I really enjoyed that aspect of the book.Also, I mentioned this in a status update while reading, but for some reason, I am REALLY intrigued by Nesta\'s character.She was totally selfish in book one and has continued to be heinously bitchy throughout the series, but there is just something about her strength, stubbornness, and just plain fucking resolve that I love. For whatever reason, I am just sometimes drawn to complex, fucked up, misunderstood female characters that everyone else hates. And I can\'t WAIT for the next book.In fact, I think the character development done in this book is going to act as a veritable buttress to the next books in the series and make them even better for its existence, as meh as it might have been plot/action-wise.So yeah, I guess I had more to say than I thought.

Anytime those people were mentioned, my interest in the book rose. Unfortunately, since they are indeed not part of the inner circle, their presence in this was either non-existent or minuscule.This book was said to bridge the gap between what happened in previous books and the next ones. I somewhat agree that there is a sense of direction as to what the next book is going to be about but most of what happened in this had no bearing on that. Honestly, I believe this novella wasn’t necessary and SJM should have written a full book. This book had so many unnecessary fillers.What to expect- Feyre shopping- Feyre and Rhysand having dirty thoughts about themselves all the time/doing dirty things to themselves. The sex scenes/thoughts in this series used to give me anxiety because I did not want to read about that but in this, it was just annoying and old- Feyre painting- Feyre being sad that she was rich- Rhysand being ‘perfect’- To mix things up: Illyrian drama, Tamlin being sad, Nesta being annoying.Things I liked- My kind, loyal Lucien: I loved reading about him (mostly from other people talking about him) and I loved his brief appearance.- I liked reading about Tamlin even though it was mostly depressing. I have a feeling his situation is going to change soon.- I think among the inner circle, Azriel is my favourite and I loved reading about him. I’m curious about his shadows.- I like Eris… I don’t know why, I tried not to but I can’t help it. I think there is more to him than meets the eye.- I liked Feyre when she was not with/thinking about Rhysand. She’s actually a really nice and caring person.Now to get to some details- I know ACOTAR was beauty and the beast retelling but Tamlin in this gave me 'pre-belle' beast vibe with how lonely and depressing him and his court is. So hopefully, his belle would come soon 💕- I honestly don’t think Feyre did that much damage in the spring court to warrant the current state- I used the ship Nesta with Cassian like most people do but while reading this, I realized that I only shipped them because of the tension they have together. I used to like Nesta because I found her intriguing but she was so annoying in this and I honestly don’t know why Cassian still likes her. He deserves better and I honestly started shipping him with that girl at the shop smh- I also used to Ship Elain with Lucien but she’s so rude to him. No one is saying you have to be with him but at least be nice. He also deserves better- I don’t ship Azriel with Elain because their relationship gives me family vibe and not romantic. Especially with the comment about his mother- I still can’t believe Mor hasn’t told Azriel the truth..Until she does that, I don’t think I can like her.- I’m tired of being sad for Lucien. I really hope in the next books, we see him being happyOverall, if you’re a Feysand fan, you’ll probably really like this but I’m not so it was eh.This book wasn't worth my excitement and not just because Lucien was there for like 2 pagesP.Sare we ever going to know how rhysand became the most powerful high lord in history? or at least how that was provenPre-readingThis comes in exactly 2 weeks.

The Love Hypothesis
",Ali Hazelwood,4.13,1541733,7915,"Contemporary, Fiction, Contemporary Romance, Adult, Audiobook, Chick Lit, New Adult",373,14-09-2021,"As a third-year Ph.D. candidate, Olive Smith doesn't believe in lasting romantic relationships--but her best friend does, and that's what got her into this situation. Convincing Anh that Olive is dating and well on her way to a happily ever after was always going to take more than hand-wavy Jedi mind tricks: Scientists require proof. So, like any self-respecting biologist, Olive panics and kisses the first man she sees.That man is none other than Adam Carlsen, a young hotshot professor--and well-known ass. Which is why Olive is positively floored when Stanford's reigning lab tyrant agrees to keep her charade a secret and be her fake boyfriend. But when a big science conference goes haywire, putting Olive's career on the Bunsen burner, Adam surprises her again with his unyielding support and even more unyielding... six-pack abs.Suddenly their little experiment feels dangerously close to combustion. And Olive discovers that the only thing more complicated than a hypothesis on love is putting her own heart under the microscope.","[{'rating': 1, 'content': ""I want to say this is a case of “It’s not the book, it’s me.” But then again, isn’t that the case for every book we end up disliking that everyone else enjoyed?The Love Hypothesisfollows Olive, a PhD student who wants to prove to her best friend that she has moved on and is dating. With no way to prove it, she kisses the first man she sees, which ends up being none other than Dr. Carlsen, known as one of the most unapproachable and critical professors. With his own reasoning, he agrees to become Olive’s fake boyfriend. But what starts as a fake relationship and fake feelings later turns into what Olive wishes were real instead.Olive is a woman in STEM, but that is really all she is. I admit, I loved this representation, and her experience as a scholar conducting research felt realistic, especially considering she’s not American (she’s Canadian), she’s not male, and she’s pretty young (26). Most of these end up being boundaries for young folk pursuing PhD careers in America, and it’s impressive to see representation like this. This was probably my favorite part of the book because Olive tells us how it’s been difficult for her to participate in a rigorous program like this, from being denied opportunities, not being believed in, to being seen as inferior, all because she’s a young woman in a predominantly male-dominated curriculum. While I’m not a STEM student, I even see it myself in the political field I study in. Men teach most classes, most advisors and major professors are also male, most students in classes end up being men, and everything else is usually male-dominated.Other than that, there was nothing.One part of the problem is Adam himself. Adam felt very, verybland.It was difficult to understand his personality and the type of person he was other than moody and sullen because it’s something we are constantly and repeatedly told, especially from Olive. I usually like fictional men like him, even if the way he acts and looks is nothing new, but this case didn’t work for me.You could say he needed much more seasoning.Not only that, but by visualizing what I read, I couldn’t picture Olive for the life of me. All I remember from her is that she is a PhD student in the Biology Department at Stanford University, is Canadian, 5”8, and I guess she has brown hair based on the cover. And . . . yeah, that’s it. Visually, I could envision Adam more than Olive, yet we spend the entire book in Olive’s mind (since it’s told from her point of view). This all ties back to the writing and how difficult it was to enjoy the book more because of how little description was given to the characters. Adam, for instance, felt like he needed more personality. I understand him being sullen and broody is part of it (which, as I’ve said before, is perfectly fine with me and understandable), but I feel like it has to do less with that and more with just the mere fact that Adam is just . . . Adam. The whole book, we don’t really know what Olive looks like or what she likes, and all we know about Adam is that he is ayoung, hot-shot professorwho hardly ever smiled and went through tough situations as a PhD student himself. Oh, and we can’t forget that he’s big, especially when you’re reminded every fucking page.That was it.Speaking of, Olive’s personality also felt a little childish sometimes.The situation that led to Olive kissing Adam (without knowing, of course) is completely unrealistic, so it’s one you need to put your logic to the side for.It made no sense to me how a PhD student, one who is researching pancreatic cancer in one of the best Biology departments of the United States, would kiss a random man she saw in the hallway because she wants to prove to her best friend that she truly is over the boy her best friend wants to date.Because . . . yeah, that’s the actual situation.Olive’s best friend, Anh, wants to date Jeremy, Olive’s ex. Olive is over him and wants nothing to do with him, but Anh thinks it’s breaking the girl code by dating Jeremy, even though Olive knows Anh really likes Jeremy. So to prove that she’s over him and is dating someone else, she kisses Adam when she sees the opportunity that Anh can see them.Pretty unrealistic scenario for a PhD student, if you ask me.Also, it’s not exactly stated, but Olive may or may not be in the asexual spectrum, specifically demisexuality. It’s briefly mentioned in the beginning (even the term is used) and when she and Adam are about to have sex, she mentions to Adam,“It’s not that I want to not have sex. I just . . . don’t particularly want to have it. There is something weird about my brain, and my body, and—I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but I don’t seem to be able to experience attraction like other people. Like normal people. I tried to just . . . just to do it, to get it over with, and the guy I did it with was nice, but the truth is that I just don’t feel any . . .” She closed her eyes. This was difficult to admit. “I don’t feel any sexual attraction unless I actually get to trust and like a person, which for some reason never happens. Or, rarely. It hadn’t, not in a long time, but now—I really like you, and I really trust you, and for the first time in a million years I want to—”For starters, I literally got second-hand embarrassment, and second, I can’t help but wish it was was expanded more on. It was as if the author just wanted to add more to Olives lacking personality so she sprinkled some pretty damn humiliating ace representation.Many people might not realize how ignorant it really is when you take a misrepresented and underrepresented sexual orientation and make your character say “there is something wrong with [her] brain,” making it seem like she “isn’t normal” because she experiences sexual attraction differently than “normal people”. Saying this is stereotypical, ignorant, and generally rude.Part of these quibbles made the romance more unrealistic and less believable. I had everything I love: professor x student, grumpy x sunshine, and fake dating.But all good things must come to an end.Because of the inability to imagine Olive, not appreciate an unseasoned broody man, and express concern over a PhD student's attitude at certain times, the romance also failed. There were definitely some of the good moments I love in a romance: the firstrealkiss, feeling the comfort of the other’s touch, realizing you’re falling for for someone you thought you would only see for 10 minutes, but the chemistry felt off. It takes a while for the two to kiss with real feelings inside the two, and while I love a slow-burn, I am still always about that emotional connection, and Olive and Adam felt like they didn’t have it. I firmly believe part of it has to do with the fake dating itself. Some of their moments felt awkward and even forced that I wondered how the two would develop feelings. They were also in moments where they had been “dating” for a while now, in a way the two would really know what to expect, yet they still fumbled like two teenagers experiencing love for the first time. In a way, they were, but I didn’t like how it played out for a PhD student and professor with a PhD. It just made it too unrealistic. There weren’t enough moments between them that made me root for them as a real couple and hope for the best. I even feel as if they weren't friends just because everything they were doing together was part of their whole “We're dating, so we need people to see us” scheme. Their moments felt completely forced, and not even because they’re fake dating.They just felt boring.While I had no problem with the writing style itself, I expected to be told more about Olive and Adam. I couldn’t understand how or why Adam liked Olive. Other than her being nice and intelligent, there wasn’t anything to appreciate.Olive first had a crush on Adam, but based on her inner monologue, that crush quickly turned into “I love him” mode, which I was unable to understand where it came from. Most of the moments Adam and Olive have are part of their fake dating scheme (they want Anh, other students, and faculty to see them for reasons. Don’t ask). While they talk professionally and personally, it made her crush on Adam realistic and understandable (a crush is easily made, anyway), but the whole love thing felt like it came out of the blue.And the sex scene?We don't talk about it.I wish I could say I laughed at the humor, but I truly didn’t laugh at anything. Well, I did laugh at the stupidity of this book.The side characters also felt too immature for me, especially Anh. She forced Olive to interact with Adam, like the sunscreen situation, the car situation, and the lap situation. Some of the situations (like miscommunication) were ridiculous and could have been solved easily if they literally just talked like the ‘adults’ they were.Overall,The Love Hypothesishad zero appreciation from me. I hoped to see some of the relationship development grow on me, but it just felt tedious. I hardly found myself smiling and laughing (like an idiot), which I usually do with books like these, but this one only felt dull.So if you’re still interested in reading this, please ignore me and my emotionless heart right now and give it a chance. You might end up finding a new favorite if you think about it. If not, then you can join me, and we can question our feelings together.ARC provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Instagram||Threads||Facebook||Amazon||TikTokUpdate: I made a TikTok about this book!https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8F6eLXf/Previous review: Why does that look like Kylo Ren and Rey wearing lab coats thoI have a reputation for being a harsh reviewer, but honestly-- I\'m just immune to hype. If I like a book, I like a book, whether it\'s popular or not. Usually, I find myself not liking hyped books, so I tend to avoid them, but as someone who works in STEM and did lab research, something about the premise of this book was constantly beckoning me. I NEEDED it.Now that I have read the book, I have some thoughts.LIKES✔️ The STEM angle.I did get the impression while reading this that the author was on comfortable and familiar territory. I felt that way about reading LOVE ON THE BRAIN, too. It blends into the narrative in a really nice and satisfying way. You get the, ""Oh yeah, I\'m reading about science! SCIENCE RULES!"" vibe, but it never feels inaccessible. You\'re in on the joke. That\'s not always easy to do with technical writing, so I admired that in this romance.✔️Adam.Look, he might have the personality of a sour glass of milk, but do we stan a gentle giant of a consent king? Yes the fuck we do. I\'m starting to suspect that Ivy League Professor love interests are basically celebrity romances for stuck-up dark academia girlies. The way people swoon in this man\'s presence like they\'re at a Daisy and the Six concert in Daisy and the Six just cracks me up.✔️The food descriptions.I\'m a sucker for a food-friendly romance. And if you\'re going to have a book set in Palo Alto, you gotta dig in (literally! nom nom nom) to the California food scene. Which this book did. To my appreciation.✔️ The weird cheap dates.They\'re students and supposed to be broke. So I don\'t know, I thought it was kind of cute how one of their dates was a stereotypical coffee date and another was a trip to get their flu shots together. I don\'t know, it just felt very college. (Plus, pro-vaccine!)✔️ The sex scenes.Were honestly fine! But BookTok would have you believe that this isFifty Shades of Science, though, and it is not. On the spice scale, this ranks so low that a Midwestern housewife might actually use it to season her mashed potato casserole. This isn\'t even a chili. It\'s black pepper with a kick. Yes, it\'s open door, but it\'s very vanilla and pretty brief.DISLIKES❌️ My sense of disbelief has been thoroughly snapped.The entirety of this book hinges on Olive kissing Adam (not consensually) to trick her friend into thinking she\'s over a guy. Then they fake date to (1) continue this ruse of lying to her friend and (2) trick Adam\'s superiors into thinking that he isn\'t going to move away and get a better job. I haven\'t read this much pathological-lying-for-fun-and-profit since Sophia Kinsella\'sShopaholicseries. Lying is not just a cute little misunderstanding. I know people can be nonconfrontational but this really did feel pathological.❌️The demisexual(?) rep.Olive appears to be coded as demisexual because at one point she tells Adam that she has a low sex drive and can\'t really have sex with people unless she feels an emotional connection. But then, ofc, she becomes a total size queen who\'s horny for Adam... and it starts to feel kind of like she was ""cured"" by sex. I will not understate the value of a sexual relationship that makes you feel emotionally and psychologically ""seen,"" but if Olive was demisexual, I wish she had used the label and there had been more context for her sexuality, and why she feels the way she does.❌️He can fit her whole boob in his mouth.I did not need to know this. But now, alas, I do. Also she\'s the tiniest smol-smol pixie girl to ever stand at a mighty 5\'8"" and there\'s like several mentions of how Adam\'s monstercock and monsterhands are so BIIIIIIIG that he might, idk, snap her like a wishboner. I rolled my eyes over all of this a lot. I know it\'s a kink, but it\'s not mine.❌️There\'s a lot of hate for the sciences in a book that\'s supposed to be empowering to women.I wouldn\'t say this if it weren\'t also present in the other book by the author that I read, but... for a ""STEMinist"" book, it kind of feels like this book hates women in the sciences. Both this book and LotB had conflicts that revolved around the heroine suffering some HUGE (police-involvement-level) harassment campaigns as a result of her gender that interfered with her work. Both this book and LotB feature heroines who seem almost disillusioned with their work and aren\'t really sure they\'re in academia for the right reasons. Both this book and LotB kind of give the impression that it\'s every girl for herself in the science world, which P.S.sucksby the way, so it ends up giving not-like-other-girls.❌️BIG MISUNDERSTANDINGS EVERYWHERE.If you like this trope, you\'ll be happy. But I\'m not a fan of big misunderstandings where both otherwise reasonable characters are deliberately and out-of-characteristically obdurate for the sole purpose of furthering the plot.So overall, this book was fine. I\'m surprised the author gets as much hate as she does for her books because they do what they set out to do. LOVE ON THE BRAIN is definitely a superior work, though, so I\'m actually super curious about her most recent releases because she does seem to be improving with each subsequent book. My advice is to go into these expecting an airport chicklit sort of read, except with a hefty seasoning of some easily digestible science facts.I know I\'m probably forgetting to say more stuff but I think my review more than substantiates the rating.2.5 to 3 stars'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""idk what kind of drugs y’all are on but i evidently did not receive my portionmaybe manvi is right and i just really hate popular booksbut, this was just… not good?the pureagonyof having to read this. yes, i was held at gun point and forced to finish it, do not ask questions, i am not allowed to talk about iti actually picked this to have something fun and easy to read in-between studying but instead i got this infuriating reading experience and a massive spike in my heart rate just from sheer annoyance. you will hear from my cardiologist, believe me, he’s not happy.this was just plain boring. do i care about the couple? no. they could have not ended up together and it would have made no difference to me. why would i root for people who can’t manage to open their goddamn mouth and just talk to each other about their feelings? how does anyone even have relationships? the miscommunication in this was just *chefs kiss* and not in a good way. everyone and their mum knew that adam was in love with olive and yet. yes this man who let’s you coat him in sunscreen and buys you your disgusting pumpkin spice latte (yes, i am with adam on this one. but. hear me out: i’m allergic, so.) and looks at you like the sun shines out of your ass is definitely head over heels for another woman. makes sense.also, the whole spiel about adam being this huge asshole when in reality he a. wasn’t and b. was actually right in that one specific instance and just doing his job of „raising“ good future scientists by giving them pointers how to do good research. and yet i had to sit through that whole drama of „buhu, how dare you date this mean prof, who made me do actual work on my dissertation, i will now hate you, because you are enabling him by dating him“. first of all, have you considered that you’re just doing shit work. second, how the fuck is it olive’s problem. why did i have to read this. it was such an unnecessary conflict.there’s this thing in romance books where they have to hyperfocus on one of the man’s physical attributes and if it’s not the eyes it’s his fucking size. we get it. adam is big.

I just have to give myself a little pep talk. Won\'t take more than a paragraph or two.Okay, Emma. I know you - gag - felt...feelings during this book. I know you were invested in the romance in a way that you have rarely been invested in anything that can remotely be construed as warm and cozy and positive. Your most-watched movie is Spotlight and when you were at home alone for a week you spent it rewatching Mindhunter and You. Your heart is typically shale-esque, in hardness and brittleness and darkness.So I know that you\'re tempted to give five stars for the fact that it cracked your Grinchy shell and made your heart grow three sizes or whatever, but no.This is not a perfect book even though reading it was, like, a near-perfect experience.Even I, who thinks the miscommunication part of any romance is the best part due to the fact that is the most angsty and suffering-based, thought there were about 7 miscommunications too many here.And I could have used a bit more personality from our love interest. Maybe, I don\'t know, actually I take that back because men should leave being fun and characterized to women, who do it better.Okay. End pep talk because it isn\'t working. This is an insanely cute and skipped-heartbeat-inducing book and I want to give it five stars for that alone.Maybe I\'ll come back to it.Bottom line: Yippee!

Be still, my heart!Olive is a third year Ph.D. candidate, filling her pipettes and titrating like a boss, when she somehow manages to land herself in a fake relationship with the ever glowering Dr. Adam Carlsen. She really can't believe her bad luck. Unfortunately, she has spun her lies, so she has no choice but to see them through. But the more time they spend together, the more Olive starts to realize he might just be the one she's been looking for all along.This was just a hoot and a half! A lot of romcoms manage to get the romantic part exactly right, butThe Love Hypothesishits the comedy bit out of the park too. Olive's dialogues are witty and snarky, and she pretty much cracked me up from beginning to end. I couldn't stop giggling and snorting, even while reading in public, which definitely got me some weird looks from strangers.I absolutely loved that Ali Hazelwood chose a woman in STEM as her main character and highlighted the difficulties they encounter as part of this story. As a woman in STEM myself, it warms my heart to see someone like me take center stage in a romance. A lot of what Olive went through, including how intimidating it is to be in a field surrounded by men and how unsure she is of her worth and her ability, I understand intimately.The romance between Olive and Adam developed slowly, with plenty of tension and sizzle. The premise to set up the trope of fake dating was a little silly, but once you get past that, the rest is nothing short of sweet and satisfying. Adam is reticent in the beginning, but he soon thaws and warms up to Olive's relentless cheer and good-natured teasing. His support of her in their shared field is particularly touching and it made me root even harder for this couple.With romances, there's always the question of whether it contains explicit, open-door scenes. And whichever way the book chooses to go, it inevitably alienates half of the readership who wants it the other way. That's why I was particularly fond of the way it was handled in this book. All those scenes are in one contiguous chunk (spread across two chapters), so it's easy to skip if that's not your thing and you can still enjoy the rest of the story without having to worry about missing anything crucial.This story totally checks all the boxes for me. It's sweet, smart, and uproariously funny, and it touched my heart and my mind. No doubt about it, anything Ali Hazelwood writes from now on will be devoured by me posthaste.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:Love on the BrainThe STEMinist NovellasUnder One RoofStuck with You~~~~~~~~~~~~This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

The number of miscommunications and misunderstandings and deliberate withholding of information truly boggles the mind.With such a skilled narrator and such a great start to the book, you would think I would be riveted to the story, but by the end I had to speed up the narration a ton just to force myself to finish.

Have you read therightWattpad stories? Some of them are masterpieces and no, I don\'t take criticism. And no, I\'m not talking aboutAftereither 😌The Love Hypothesis will go down as the biggest surprise of this year and no one is more surprise than me. This book has been EVERYWHERE I go. I couldn\'t outrun this book, even if I wanted to. And you know with hype comes great expectations. And with great expectations comes even greater disappointments. Therefore, I made it my mission to go into TLH expecting nothing and received everything.I\'ve read the prologue and I WAS HOOKED!!!When do you ever stumble into a stranger\'s bathroom blinded, because you\'re wearing lenses that has been expired for years and said stranger is going to be your biggest motivator for the years to come?Olive and Adam\'s meet-cute already had me on a chokehold.""It\'s fine."" She waved a hand. She\'d have rolled her eyes, if they hadn\'t been on fire. ""The burning usually lasts only a few minues.""""You mean you\'ve done this before?""She frowned. ""Done what?""""Put in expired contacts.""""Of course. Contacts are not cheap.""""Neither are eyes.""Followed, the story was brimmed with so many rom-com tropes. SO MANY. Maybe Ali Hazelwood tried a little bit too much to bring all of these tropes in one story and maybe it was a bit too much. Personally, I didn\'t mind it, cause every Olive x Adam interaction just made me smile like a fool. But here is a list of all the tropes, you can expect when reading The Love Hypothesis:💫 age gap (Olive, 26 & Adam, 34)💫 sunshine-grumpy💫 fake-dating💫 slow-burn💫 workplace romance💫 Ph.D student x professor (but it\'s not forbidden)💫 mutual pining💫 friends-to-lovers also known as dumbasses-to-lovers💫 one-bed trope (kinda)💫 Hero sees heroine in his clothes and is can\'t talk for a second💫 guy simping for the girl first💫 dimples💫 asshole-ish Hero who is only soft for his girl💫 endless banter and teasing""Come on. Maybe we\'re lucky and the chair will spot us. And I\'ll buy you an ice cream sandwich afterward.""""Will I be paying for this ice-cream sandwich?"" He sounded resigned now.""Likely. Actually, scratch that, you probably don\'t like ice cream anyawy, because you don\'t enjoy anything that\'s good in life."" She kept on walking, pensively chewing on her lower lip. ""Maybe the cafeteria has some raw broccoli?""""I don\'t deserve this verbal abuse on top of the flu shot.I\'ll spare the subpar summary of this book, cause y\'all can read the blurb for yourself and jump right into everything else 😂｡･ﾟﾟ･The Romance･ﾟﾟ･｡Just look at the list above. It literally has all of my favorite tropes in one book. From the first interaction between Adam and Olive I was clued to the pages. I love their easy banter with each other. Olive teasing him about his age. Adam\'s hate about everything sugary (but especially Pumpkin Spice Latte).""Are you going to be less harsh, then?""""Unlikely.""She sighed. ""You know, when I have no more friends and everyone hates me because of this fake-dating thing, I\'ll be super lonely and you are going to have to hang out with me every day. I\'ll annoy you all the time. Is it really worth being mean to every grad in the program?""""Absolutely.""Adam is notoriously known as the campus asshole professor who makes every grad student piss their pants. He\'s super strict when it comes to research and calls his student out on their bullshit when someone is not good enough. But when it comes to Olive, he is a soft harmless kitten. He believes in her so much. Adam always encourages and praises Olive for her brilliant work. Adam Carlsen is Olive\'s #1 fan.""I wish you could see yourself the way I see you.""Women in STEM are underrepresentated and it was refreshing to see Olive being one of the few women working there and making a difference with her research on pancreatic cancer. It was interesting to read Olive\'s frustrating with being a grad student.. all the struggles and insecurites that come with it. All these priviliged white men that think they are some hot shot, but doing the bare minimum work.Olive\'s smart, a great friend, but you know when I fell in love with her? When Olive and Adam went on their first fake coffee date and Adam offered to pay for her coffee, cuz he knows she\'s a poor student and what does that girl do? Adds chocolate chip cookie, a banana and a pack of gum to her coffee 😂😂😂 the audacity lmao yes girl get that luxury package lunch 😂""You\'re so big."" He groaned into her neck. His entire body was vibrating with tension.""You can take it.""The Love Hypothesis was very low on the heat level, but that one sex scene we got. I looooved it 🥵🥵🥵 Every time a Hero has such a big dick that the heroine doesn\'t know if she can take it and he assures her that she can I\'M SCREaMINg 🥵🥵🥵 When Adam tells her that he wants to go down on her until she passes out 🥵🥵🥵🥵 When Adam asked Olive if he can fuck her... I\'m on my knees for my consent king 🛐🥵Adam Carlsen, ik hou van jou 🛐🛐🛐Adam: My arm hurtsOlive: From the flu shot?Adam: It\'s really painful.Olive: Oh, Adam. I\'m so sorry.Olive: Should I come over and kiss it better?Adam: You never said it would hurt so bad.Olive: As someone once told me, it\'s not my job to work on your emotin regulation skills.Adam: 🖕｡･ﾟﾟ･The Friendship between Olive and Anh･ﾟﾟ･｡Anh is Vietnamese and I never see Viet rep in romance book so ofc I\'m going to love this girl. Not biased or anything. Anh was a queen anyway and it wasn\'t hard to stan her 💅""No matter how many pounds of spoiled shrimp cocktail you projectile vomit, you can trust me. We\'re a team, you and I. And Malcolm, when he\'s not busy screwing his way though the Stanford population. So if Carlsen is secretly an extraterrestrial life-form planning a takover of Earth that will ultimately result in humanity being enslaved by evil overlords who look like cicadas, and the only way to stop him is dating him, you can tell me and I\'ll inform NASA–""Find yourself a best friend who would marry you if she thinks you will get deported back to Canada and need a green card. 🥺You don\'t understand how much I love Anh. She was probably my favorite characters from this whole book (no offense to Olive and Adam, cause I love them a lot).My love for her already started that she didn\'t want to date Jeremy, because Olive dated him and gave her approval. This girl knows the girl code too well and it\'s for her that Olive had to come up with this ridicilous idea of kissing the first guy she sees in the hallway to convince Anh that she\'s over Jeremy, so these two can get it on. But then, Anh is also the best wingwoman without knowing. All of her demands for Olive and Adam to show their PDA (Olive using Adam has her chair ✔️ Olive putting sunscreen on a half naked Adam ✔️ Olive kissing Adam ✔️) The list of sexual harassment Adam could compile, I\'d love to see it. 😇｡･ﾟﾟ･The Side-Characters･ﾟﾟ･｡The rest of the secondary characters like Holden and Malcolm were awesome too. I love Adam and Holden\'s friendship. How Holden tries to embarass Adam and Adam pretending to be annoyed and tolerating him even tho their bromance is more than solid. Most of all Holden has Adam\'s back.""I have access to your Google Calender, asshole. You\'re not busy. If you don\'t want to hang out with me, you can just be honest.""""I don\'t want to hang out with you.""""You little shit. After the wee we just had. And on my birthday.""Adam recoiled slightly. ""What? It\'s not your birthday.""""Yes, it is.""""Your birthday is April tenth.""""Is it, though?""Adam closed his eyes, scratching his forehead. ""Holden, we\'ve talked daily for the past twenty-five years, and I have been to at least five Power Rangers-themed birthday parties of yours. The last one was when you turned seventeen. I know when your birthday is.""""You always had it wrong, I was just too nice to tell you.""Malcolm and Olive had a cute friendship too. Loved how Malcolm was so support of Olive\'s feeling for Adam even tho he didn\'t like him. Malcolm with Anh probably the only characters with some brain cells. He gave Olive some good dating advise, but did she listen noooo.｡･ﾟﾟ･A Book not without its faults･ﾟﾟ･｡Like the clown that I am, I really thought this book might be a 5 star read after only reading the prologue lmao that\'s how much I loved Olive and Adam\'s first meeting 😂 But of course I jinxed myself, cause there were a couple of things that I annoyed me.I call this book dumbasses-to-lovers for a reason. Olive and Adam had clearly feelings for each other, but were too chicken shit to confess them. Olive had confessed to Malcolm that she was falling in love w Adam and Adam heard it and when Olive said she was talking about someone else, that dumbass really believed her. I mean it makes for good angst for exacly 3 seconds cause I could feel my boy\'s pain, but how could he not known it was him all along. Same with Olive and her thinking the ""amazing girl"" Adam was pining for all these year was some random women in his faculty like 😭😭😭 guys I thought you were SMART 😭And that ending was so unsatisfying. I hate it when a romance doesn\'t have a proper love confession scene. I know Adam loves Olive and he told it to other, but we never got his ""I love you"" that he said to Olive. There was her confession and then it was cut right to the epilogue that wasn\'t all that satisfying either..｡･ﾟﾟ･Conclusion･ﾟﾟ･｡Should I study for an exam that I have tmrr and instead have read this book? Yes. (1)Will I fail said exam because of this book? Also yes. (2)Will I blame Ali Hazelwood and fictional characters for my inability to manage my life? Y-E-S. (3)Would I do it all over again? See answers (1) to (3)No regrets, I love Olive and Adam so much and The Love Hypothesis will be in my favorite books I\'ve read this year. ♥️P.S. this book taught me to carry myself with the confidence of a medicore white man if I wanna reach my goal and I\'ll always remember that. I\'ll go into the exam with that mentality, I\'m suing if I\'m still going to fail 😌'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'someone forgot to take the wattpad out of this book 💀'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '***TODAS LAS ESTRELLAS DEL UNIVERSO***”I’m going to kill you. If you say another word about the woman I love, if you look at her, if you even think about her, I’m going to fucking kill you”.Este libro es uno de los más bonitos que he leído en mucho tiempo. ¿Saben de esos libros que, cuando los leen, de verdad los hacen volver a creer en el amor? Pues, por muy cursi que suene, eso fueThe Love Hypothesispara mí. Sí, leo un montón de libros de fantasía romántica que tienen unos ideales del amor espectaculares, pero a la vez se sienten tremendamente inalcanzables. PeroThe Love Hypothesises una historia de amor entre dos personas que no son perfectas, que comenten muchísimos errores, que tienen miedo de dejar sus sentimientos al alcance de cualquiera y que, sobre todo, se sienten muy, muy reales.Aquí nos encontramos con Olive, una científica que está intentando encontrar fondos para su investigación sobre un tipo de cáncer y, al mismo tiempo, está tratando de que su mejor amiga se anime a salir con un chico que le encanta, pero que resulta que es su ex. Para impulsarla, Olive decide que su amiga debe verla feliz con un hombre, pero el problema es que su vida amorosa está más desolada que el desierto del Sahara. Sin embargo, un día, en un impulso y aprovechando que su amiga la está viendo, Olive se lanza a besar a uno de los profesores del departamento… que resulta ser nada más y nada menos que Adam Carlsen, a quien básicamente todo el mundo teme porque es frío y despiadado con los estudiantes. La cosa es que, contra todo pronóstico, Olive y Adam terminan entrando en un acuerdo defake dating, cada uno con sus propios motivos, pero todos sabemos cómo acaba esto.Si me conocen, saben que a veces suelo ser supremamente impaciente con los libros que tienen romancesslowburn… yThe Love Hypothesises la definición de eso. Sin embargo, les juro que no había disfrutado tantísimo un libro en mucho tiempo. Toda la historia de Olive y Adam, la tensión que se fue desarrollando con cada encuentro incómodo, con cada situación loca en la que se metían, con cada malentendido, con cada escena en la que se notaba que ambos tenían un poco oxidados sus capacidades de relacionarse con otros seres humanos, con cada pequeña sonrisa que Olive le sacaba a Adam, con los chistes internos que empezaron a aparecer, con las miradas, con la angustia, con el miedo de estar enamorándose del otro y quizás no ser correspondido… wow, todo eso fue como una flecha que se me iba clavando cada vez más hondo en el corazón, que me recordaba eternamente mi desgraciada soltería y que me hacía quererlos a ellos cada vez más. Es absolutamente demente lo mucho que uno puede llegar a involucrarse emocionalmente con dos personas que ni siquiera existen. Pero esa es la magia de los libros, supongo.Y sí, hubo momentos frustrantes en los que quería golpearlos a los dos y encerrarlos en una habitación para que dejaran de pensar cosas idiotas y, por fin, aceptaran que estaban locos el uno por el otro… En serio, hay momentos en los que me sacaban de quicio. Pero al mismo tiempo todo era hermoso y parte de sus procesos. Sobre todo con respecto a Olive. Y me gustaría muchísimo hablar de un aspecto de ella con el que me identifiqué a niveles estratosféricos, pero eso sería unspoiler, así que dejaré que lo descubran ustedes cuando lean el libro.¿Y el final? ¿Qué puedo decirles? Esos últimos capítulos son perfectos, increíbles,spicy, llenos de sentimientos, de más malentendidos, de momentos épicos y, sobre todo, de muchísima, muchísima felicidad. No les puedo decir mucho más, pero sepan queThe Love Hypothesises uno de esos libros que, aunque te pueden frustrar por momentos y que pueden tener escenas tristes, siempre van a quedar como unhighlightde felicidad en tu memoria.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Olive plants a giant kiss on a random person in the hallway.

Will Olive and Adam be able to convince everyone that they are a couple? Will they discover any real feelings? Plus, Olive is about to graduate....As far as romance novels go, this one was pretty sweet and funny. It was also a quick read. Although I do wish that Adam wasn't always described as essentially an underwear model. Isn't it enough just to be ridiculously smart with a decent job? Do you have to have six-pack abs too? Setting expectations a little high? This might have alienated some readers but if Adam and Olive are both scientists, why don't they have more scientific discussions? I'm not a very scientific person, but I would assume that it would be like two literary buffs quoting book phrases to each other.Overall, this was an enjoyable book with some quality plot development.

Oh, well, I didn\'t enjoy this book whenever I think of it. And it makes me anxious to think that I rated it with 3 stars, lmao... After this, I might be able to rest in peace, knowing that I rated as I thought when I first finished it. Straight to ""big hype, big lie"" shelf. :D“He’d clearly never seen a rom-com or read a romance novel in his life.”Buckle up, bitches, there are some spoilers ahead!I honestly haven\'t read a lot books with ""miss sunshine and mister grumpy"" trope, but I kind of know how the thing goes, so yikes.For what I know, this book was a Reylo fanfic, so picturing Adam as Adam Driver wasn\'t complicated. But it made it hard for me because. . . Idk, it\'s not that I think he\'s ugly, but I don\'t think either that he\'s sexy. If you find him attractive and that stuff, then you know your reasons.I\'ve seen a LOT —y\'all know that I don\'t lie with this— of hype for this book. *looks at booktok, booktwt, bookstagram* So, I had to give it a try. . . Every single day appears on my feed at least 6 times in a row friends\' updates of this book, so, I thought ""this book must be good"".Anyhow, I don\'t actually know how to feel about this book. . . It was. . . weird? Sweet? Awkward? Immature?Idk, you name it.I\'m fan of nerd and smart people who\'re not smug, arrogant and assholes. Actually, there\'s more probability that I fall in love with some nerd (I\'m not straight, so, lol) like Adam or Olive than for someone like Tom (he was hot, but he was such a fucking dick).I hadZEROexpectations from this book because lately ""great"" and overhyped books tend to disappoint me to the point of not wanting to have high hopes (don\'t start with the ""then why do you read them?"" because I\'m not a nice person when it comes to insult people, lmao) aND YET, HERE I AM, WRITING THE REVIEW OF THIS BOOK.I need to check up on my life choices. . . Which makes me go to the thing that drove me mad in this book: eVERY SINGLE FUCKING TIME OLIVE WAS LIKE ""YES, THIS IS MY LIFE BECAUSE OF MY DECISIONS"", YES, SIS, WE GET IT. YOU\'VE MADE SOME SILLY AND POOR DECISIONS, BUT BUCKLE UP, AND MOVE THE FUCK ON.Also, I was so fucking tired of the“carry yourself with the confidence of a mediocre white man”Yes, we get it, white men are mediocre. Most of them are. I just don\'t know why, but that phrase pissed me off.Chapter 16 was so hyped. Bitch, no. It was awkward and it seemed very very very forced. It is mentioned (briefly, but there it is) that Olive might be asexual, which is fine and I don\'t judge that because I am ace and I totally get how it feels. Nevertheless, I did think that was forced:Iperceived her uncomfortable doing that, despite the fact that she agreed. I honestly don\'t know how sex works, lol. Totally unnecessary. I get the hype for some things, but not for chapter 16. It wasn\'t spicy in any single way. It made me feel uncomfortable and I was cringing every 10 seconds. I thought that something good was gonna happen, and I was left with empty hands because I received nothing from that chapter.Idk why, but Olive seemed VERY immature and Adam was flat? Yes, Mr. Grumpy and-I-hate-everything-black-is-my-color-because-black-is-my-soul-and-I-make-my-grades-cry. I get the trope, I really do, but give him some personality???Adam it\'s perceived as someone complicated and who loves their own personal space (again, I don\'t judge because I enjoy my own personal space as no one) and Olive describes him as ""antagonic and unapproachable"" aLL THE TIME. If people told me that, I\'d take it as a joke, but deep down that shit hurts, even as a joke or random comment, but, yeah, us, grumpy people, are like that. I get that Adam is huge, that have big ass hands, big body, big shoulders and big dick. wE GET IT. Just please stop repeating it every damn time the damn man appears.Sometimes, I disliked Anh. I didn\'t know if she was around 26 or 15. She basically forced Olive to do things that obviously she didn\'t wanna do, despite the fact that Anh thought that Olive and Adam were dating and she didn\'t know the whole truth. She was very flat and at the very end we didn\'t have a lot of her.After the big disappointing that chapter 16 turned out to be, I was even more disappointed than ever. I mean, as I said: I had very little —if none at this point— expectations, but chapter 16 made it go from 0.01 to -00000000000000000000 in a span of 5 minutes, and I didn\'t wanna read anymore.When Adam said, and I quote:""If you say another word about the woman I love...""I lost my shit. I was fucking melting and no, I am not ashamed of it, lol.The romance was okay I guess??? I don\'t know why, but I expected more. Please don\'t ask me why, because even I don\'t know the answer to that... Perhaps it was all of the hype on booktok and bookstagram, but it was a flop to me, lmao.Overall I guess it was fine? Idk dude, writing this review made me realize that I didn\'t like this book as much as I wanted.Tho I\'d fake-date / fake-marry someone to get out of Latin America (third world country issues, lol) and get the citizenship in another country, perhaps Europe or Canada? Idk, love can come with time, lol.Tom was an asshole and I wish Adam would have punch him in the face :)In overall, as I didn\'t enjoy a lot of romance (or think that actually was romantic, cute and that stuff) makes me think that I\'m a heartless and cold bitch who can\'t feel a single thing or will never fall in love. bUT I\'M ALSO A HOPELESS ROMANTIC.

So I thank my lucky stars that the Garricks miraculously give me a job, cleaning their stunning penthouse with views across the city and preparing fancy meals in their shiny kitchen. I can work here for a while, stay quiet until I get what I want. It's almost perfect. But I still haven't met Mrs Garrick, or seen inside the guest bedroom. I'm sure I hear her crying. I notice spots of blood around the neck of her white nightgowns when I'm doing laundry. And one day I can't help but knock on the door.

I can protect Mrs. Garrick while keeping my own secrets locked up safe. Douglas Garrick has done wrong. He is going to pay. It's simply a question of how far I'm willing to go...","[{'rating': 4, 'content': ""In a Nutshell:The good news is that this is just like ‘The Housemaid.’ The bad news is that this is just like ‘The Housemaid.’ A fun thriller, as long as you don’t overanalyse it. Better if you read the series in order.Story Synopsis:Millie is back, still working as a maid, and still struggling for finances. She is in a steady relationship with Brock, a lawyer who doesn’t know anything about her past. Not that she loves Brock, but as Enzo isn’t around, he will do.After Millie loses her current job, she gets a call from Douglas Garrick, a wealthy tech specialist. He wants Millie to clean and cook, but on one condition|: she is NOT to interact with his wife Wendy, who is ill. As Millie is desperate for a job, she agrees. However, things are, but obviously, not as declared, and Millie finds herself in a quandary; risk her job by helping Wendy, or go against her values by ignoring what’s happening?The book comes to us in the first person perspective of two of the characters, one being Millie.This sequel doesn't exactly continue from the end of the first novel, but provides enough of context to help us bridge to the events of this book. Though this can work as a standalone, I recommend you read the series in order, because Millie’s personality is much better explored in the first book.Since I complain about Bookouture blurbs quite often (Sorry, Bookouture! I still love you though!), I think I should also give them credit when they nail the task. The blurb of this book is spot on, revealing just as much as needed and creating enough interest without spoiling the fun or misleading. Good job!On the pro side, the story has every positive element that was present in the earlier book:👉 Quick-paced writing.👉 A storyline that keeps you invested even when you know what’s to come (or so you think.)👉 An intriguing prologue.👉 Characters who say one thing and do something else.👉 Twists – some foreseeable, some out of the blue.👉 Some funny moments, courtesy Millie’s snide remarks in her first person pov.👉 An ending that works well for the story.On the flip side,⚠ The pattern of the book is exactly the same as the first book. (And many other thrillers.) So the minute the prologue began, I knew it was not narrated by whom we would assume it to be. The appearance of the second character’s pov created a huge déjà vu moment, as I knew it would contradict everything Millie had told us so far. I was still interested in the proceedings; it is just that instead of enjoying the story as a fresh tale, I found myself playing detective and figuring out the twists based on the similarity to the first book.⚠ Millie didn’t endear herself to me this time around. Her attitude towards Brock was quite irksome, and her thoughts very repetitive. While she shows her true spirit by the end, I wish it had been more evident throughout.⚠ The writing is also somewhat basic, though, to be honest, I don’t read a thriller for its prose. But the overdose of foreshadowing and the back-and-forth rambling by Millie were somewhat disappointing.All in all, this is still gripping enough to provide an entertaining ride. I liked the first book much better as it had plenty of dark undertones. This one offers standard fare in comparison.I finally have the chance to use a phrase so many of my reviewer-friends do: it’s a popcorn thriller! Treat it as such than as a literary classic. As long as you read it with your logical side kept aside, you can have fun with it.3.5 stars, rounding up as it allowed me to complete it within a day.My thanks to Bookouture and NetGalley for the DRC of “The Housemaid's Secret”.

Clunky, repetitive writing. Cringey dialogue. Predictable plot with a “twisty” part 2 retelling the same boring story from another perspective. Skip this.(( SPOILERS BELOW ))................................(( SPOILERS AHEAD ))....................(( LAST CALL - SPOILERS ARE COMING ))..............................(( HERE ARE THE SPOILERS ))..........After the events of The Housemaid, our girl Millie has earned a reputation among rich white ladies as someone who can take care of business (ie help them get away from their shitty husbands AND clean their houses and babysit - she’s the full package). Despite all of her Good Samaritan-ism to the uber-wealthy (because who needs help more than the 1%?), Millie is still super poor and struggling. So poor that she is forced to live in the South Bronx! THE SOUTH BRONX!Millie’s hot Italian groundskeeper boyfriend and Samaritanizing associate Enzo has a-gone-a back-a to-a Sicily to a-take-a care of his a-dying mama so Millie is living alone in her SOUTH BRONX apartment. But she has inexplicably scored herself a super hot and rich and nice lawyer boyfriend named Brock (which, side note: omfg don’t name a character BROCK, unless he’s, you know, a rapist swimmer douchebag), who loves her soooooo much and wants her to move into his swanky apartment OVERLOOKING CENTRAL PARK because he’s ready to settle down because of his heart condition (?) even though they’ve only been dating for six months and Millie stands him up constantly and doesn’t seem to even remotely like him as anything other than an abstract concept. She also hasn’t told him about her past, but really, really means to, eventually. But until then, she’ll just act shady AF and keep skipping their dates. Sounds like a solid plan.Millie gets a new job cleaning for another super-rich couple, Douglas & Wendy Garrick, who live in a fancy PENTHOUSE APARTMENT on the UPPER WEST SIDE, JUST WEST OF CENTRAL PARK which is super different from her poor person neighborhood (the SOUTH BRONX in case you’ve forgotten). Douglas seems vaguely hot-ish in a rich guy way, but Wendy stays hidden away in a guest room. Uh-oh.Then Millie thinks she’s being followed and she gets attacked by her skeezy neighbor dude (in the stairwell of her apartment in the SOUTH BRONX) and she stands up Brock a few more times and buys some weird rich people groceries for the Garricks. Then she sees Wendy with a busted up face and at some point Millie gets Wendy out of the PENTHOUSE APARTMENT ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE and to a cheap motel that is even worse than the SOUTH BRONX, but Douglas finds her and brings her back to the PENTHOUSE APARTMENT and continues to escalate the abuse.Then it turns out the person following Millie is none other than-a Enzo! He’s-a back-a from-a Italy and his mom is dead so he thought stalking Millie was the best plan to restart their relationship. He calls Brock “Broccoli” 197 times, and it was funny-ish the first time, but it got old real quick, and his accent a-comes and a-gos and he speaks grammatically perfectly for a few sentences and then-a goes-a back-a to not understanding English. It’s a real-a rollercoaster.Anyway, the two of them hatch a plan to save Wendy. Blah blah some stuff happens and Millie shoots Douglas and he’s dead.But.Then.The twist.The dude Millie shot is not Douglas! The real Douglas is a schlubby goober and not the handsome-ish man Millie killed. Oh dear.So then we have part 2, told from Wendy’s perspective. Turns out, Wendy is a gold-digging skank who only married schlubby Real Douglas for his money. She has an affair with Fake Douglas, who is married to Real Douglas’s secretary, Marybeth. Wendy and Fake Douglas make a plan to kill Real Douglas for his money… and to frame Millie for his murder, which really seems like a lot of trouble to go through.Jesus H. Ok. So, the gun Millie shot was full of blanks. Fake Douglas was fake dead, so then Wendy killed Real Douglas and made him real dead. Millie hides from the police because they are after her. Wendy and Fake Douglas go to his wife Marybeth’s remote cabin to hide out and do some hot-tubbing, but then a very angry Marybeth shows up and Fake Douglas gets his throat slit (!!) and Wendy gets killed with digoxin heart pills and is forced to write a suicide note explaining everything, so now Millie is off the hook. Yay.Then we jump ahead a few months, and Enzo is muscularly moving into Millie’s SOUTH BRONX apartment, and then Broccoli shows up to to pick up a box of his shit, and I guess it’s another twist that Millie gave Broccoli’s heart pills to Marybeth and that’s what killed Wendy.So, now Enzo and Millie live together in the SOUTH BRONX, and I guess she’ll find another cleaning job? Sigh.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""2.5 starsThat was... interesting.Not as good as the first book, that's for sure.It started off slow with not much happening in the first 30% of the book. It seems very similar to the first book in the beginning. Things started picking up around 50% of the book with the thriller genre coming in to play massively and since then, couldn't help but binge. Thetwists and turnsup till part 2 are really interesting and then it went downhill for me.After part 2the issues I had were all because of the two female characters.Am sorry as good asMilliewas in the first one, she is SO ANNOYING in this one. The fact she keeps on using Brock??? Like girl just stop please. I feel so bad for him throughout the book. If you don't want someone or don't love someone, just let them go!! Her inner monologues are so repetitive.Then comesWendy,I HATED her so much. She is such a narcissist, all I wanted was Douglas to just tell her her reality and find a life of his own. I wouldn't even mind if her pathetic little gold digging arse got killed off in a brutal manner. What she got was so mild compared to what she deserved.*insert multiple swear words here*Theendingwas underwhelming. The men in this book deserved better!!

Like UFFF I was in the edge of my seat and I would be lying If I said that I didn't enjoy it because I did. It kept me hooked throughout, so I have to praise freida for that atleast and the plot for this one was really well thought. I liked how everything was set up and how everything wrapped up. However, there were some plotlines that were weak but I would say I liked how strong part 1&2 were even part 3 till it's middle but from there onwards it started to go spiraling down.Millie was very annoying here. Too nosy for her own good and treated her bf like shit who was nothing but good to hear and had the audacity at the end to say that he left her when she needed her the most while she wasn't even present for most of their relationship, this part of Millie's actions was so infuriating but her being nosy and extra curious while working for Douglas was actually very smart from Freida's part because it completely took my attention from one thing and i broke my one rule 😭 but anyways, I enjoyed reading abiut Millie and by the end I didnt mind her being annoyingly curious or nosy because it served a purpose but the way she treated broc 🙄🙄 bffr Millie, bffr.As for the plot, I think Freida did a really good job at some parts especially the twist because I was not expecting that and I did enjoy it a lot but I found the start to be a little slow and part 4 to be very underwhelming and there was one thing that I'll discuss below that made no sense to me but other than that I liked the whole story.SPOILERS‼️So my one rule about reading thrillers is the first suspect is never the culprit and I broke it here 😭😭 by suspecting Douglas and hey I have to blame Millie's annoying nature because iw as so annoyed at her being nosy and all and with how Wendy (what a bitch tbh) and her constant gaslighting that I thought it was really Douglas 😭😭💀 until part two 💀 where my jaw was literally hanging on the floor. Wendy was one twisted woman like she was so insecure and tried to justify so many of her actions and pls the way she murdered Douglas at the end like 😭 my man just wanted to live a happy life but no you were too greedy and were trying to be so posh 🙄 like stfu bitch anyways, Wendy got what she deserved but hats off to her for orchestrating everything also her audacity to cheat and destroy another marriage?? 😭 Wow. Loved Douglasbecuase he had two balls and one brain to actually exclude Wendy entirely from the will. Now see this part one and two which was amazing but then comes part three where everything was not that much drawn out and then we get to the resolution and??? How??? Why??? Myrcabeth? Was that her name? It made no sense how a secretary managed to slit her husband's throat and also kill Wendy because 😭 like ik they both were having an affair but still it was so out of the blue and I didn't like it that much, it didn't feel satisfying. I also DO NOT understand like this made ZERO SENSE to me how when myrcabeth (wtv her name is) was making Wendy write a letter where she confessed to framing Millie and where she accused her of killing her husband and also herself, I didn't understand why she didn't say no because that way Wendy may have had a chance to escape or take down both millie and myrcabeth like why would she write that she was attempting to kill herself knowing that myrcabeth would kill her 😭😭😭 where she could bribe her way out or take them with her. It baffled me and that's what made lower my rating to a three.SPOILERS END‼️Overall, I had sm fun with it but the last part sucked.___Let's see where Millie ventures off to here...👀""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3.0 stars. After loving everything but the ending of “The Housemaid”I dove right into the sequel “The Housemaid’s Secret.” Although I always enjoy Ms. McFadden’s fast paced writing style, I didn’t enjoy “Secret” near as much as its predecessor. The primary distinction between the two books, in my opinion, was the tone of the book. “Secret” seemed to be written in a tounge-in-cheek style that began to grate on my nerves the more I read. For instance, at the very beginning of the book Millie gets fired from her job because the baby she was the caretaker for called her mommy in front of the baby’s real mother. It was written so over the top I couldn’t believe the author wanted me to believe this was a real scene in the book. Many other scenes (even ones depicting violent acts) were written so unrealistically, I never became invested in any of the characters. Because of the tone I would rate the book as just average even if I was able to fly through it. At times it felt like I was reading an early rough draft of the novel as the scenes were described in a bare bones style that were over before they could build any suspense. I never felt this way about “The Housemaid.” As you could probably tell from my very disjointed review, I had the hardest time explaining what I didn’t like about the book. The whimsical writing style on what could have been a great sequel to a great book left me unimpressed. I will definitely read Ms. McFadden again because admittedly her books are never boring and I’ve never had an issue with the tone of her books as it relates to the story before. Please be kind in your comments when you tell me how delusional I am in not liking the sequel as well as “ The Housemaid.”'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Book Two3.5 🍿STARSMillie is back and cleaning for a new wealthy couple,the Garricks.

Wendy Garrick is behind closed doors, recovering from an illness.Millie discovers more than she was prepared for and makes a swift decision regarding Wendy.This was an entertaining popcorn read. Seasoned thriller readers may want less ""telling of the plot"" and more discovering of the reveal (at least i did), but we still get some major twists, a nail in the coffin moment and a lifetime movie end.

I like the characters Millie and Enzo and would read more featuring them.Thanks to Netgalley for my arc. OUT February 2023'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""“The Housemaid's Secret” by Freida McFadden is another classic psychological thriller that will have everyone talking about it in 2023. A little backstory, “The Housemaid” was the first novel I read by her and I was instantly hooked. She is an exceptional author as I’ve read some of her other books as well but I was anxiously waiting for the sequel to “The Housemaid” because it was one of the best novels I read in 2022.Now, before I jump into my review, I want to let you all know about two trigger warnings in case they could affect you while reading. McFadden does a phenomenal job not describing anything in any kind of detail which is great but there are insinuations of violence against women and self-harm. Again, nothing is too detailed or graphic, just insinuated so I wanted to give everyone a heads-up about that. McFadden gets major props from me for not going into any specifics in both potential trigger warnings.I was very happy to get right back into what is going on with the main protagonist Millie since the ending to “The Housemaid” was pretty wild. Millie is awesome and I truly loved all the New York vibes in this novel. Being born and raised in Queens, NY, I loved all the references, especially to the NY Mets. It just felt so authentic and added another layer of immersion to this novel for me being a New Yorker and all.Besides that, all the little references to the first book in this series were also brilliantly done. I’d recommend reading the first one and then jumping right into this one to see what I mean. McFadden is a great storyteller that delivers some incredible suspense, mystery, tension, and my goodness, her plot twists are on a whole other level. She’s fantastic when it comes to them and they will literally have your jaw on the floor with how crazy they are once revealed. That’s exactly what happened to me and I still can’t believe them.This sequel delivers in ways only McFadden can conjure as it’s another incredible psychological thriller of a read. I love how all of her books are so fast-paced and addictive, you simply can’t put them down even if you tried. Her writing is so seamless that this novel was a genuine page-turner, especially when you get to the second half towards a crazy ending I never saw coming. Seriously, I’m still completely blown away by the ending.I give “The Housemaid's Secret” by Freida McFadden a perfect 5/5 as it’s another amazing novel by her that I’d highly recommend to anyone that wants a wild psychological thriller with crazy plot twists, mystery, and an incredible reading experience. McFadden is truly making a name for herself and I look forward to reading every single thing she’s written and all her future novels. She’s that magnificent and is an author I look forward to reading for many years to come.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""After thoroughly enjoying the first installment, I eagerly dove into this book, hungry for another whirlwind adventure in the world of Millie the maid. I can't help but keep my hopes high for the next installment, perhaps one where we follow Millie the social worker, assisting individuals caught in tumultuous relationships and dealing with dangerous spouses who mistreat their significant others. Personally, I'd love to see the narrative shift to focus on a husband's perspective in the second half of the book.I've come across several comments stating that the second book doesn't quite match the excellence of the first. However, I don't entirely agree with this sentiment. There are still incredible twists in this book that caught me off guard—not just one, but three brilliantly executed twists that took me by surprise. The first twist, while slightly more apparent, is not due to the author giving it away but rather because the book's concept encourages readers to think outside the box, fostering doubts about everyone's motives and leading us to suspect every move made by the other characters, all in an attempt to deceive us (or perhaps not-so-poor Millie, who retains her big heart to help others).In this new book, we find ourselves nearly five years ahead, witnessing the developments in Millie's life.At the end of the first book, she embarks on a journey to work in special homes, thanks to the highly-regarded references from Nina. Her mission is to aid housewives who have endured abuse at the hands of their husbands.Yet, within a few years, it appears that Millie has distanced herself from this perilous business. She particularly feels the void left by her partner in crime and her lover, Enzo, who had provided crucial resources to help abused women. Enzo's abrupt departure to Sicily to care for his ailing mother, coupled with his reluctance to specify when he'll return, leads to an amicable parting of ways. Millie begins dating Brock, a kind and caring lawyer with a critical heart condition who is eager to tie the knot soon. She also juggles cleaning and nannying jobs that come her way through word-of-mouth recommendations. Furthermore, she embarks on a journey to become a more effective social worker by enrolling in social psychology classes at a community college to better assist those in need.However, her latest gig ends abruptly when a misunderstanding with a child results in Millie being mistaken for the child's mother. The child's self-centered biological mother takes offense, leading to Millie's dismissal. Faced with no other options and fortunately without the need to move in with Brock (not broccoli), Millie manages to secure a promising job at the last minute. Douglas Garrick, a wealthy and influential business magnate, hires her to maintain his sprawling duplex penthouse, which he shares with his wife. Unfortunately, his wife's severe health condition confines her to her room for the majority of the day. The penthouse is largely spotless, with minimal chores for Millie—dusting, laundry, and preparing meals from recipes featuring obscure ingredients she's never encountered before. However, the pay and conditions are too tempting to refuse, and as the saying goes, beggars can't be choosers.Millie's plan is simple: follow her employers' instructions and avoid getting entangled in any family drama. But when she stumbles upon bloodstains in the bathroom and uncovers the reason for Wendy Garrick's seclusion—a battered and bruised face—her anger ignites. Despite the faint warning voice urging her to stay away from the family's issues, Millie can't resist intervening. Wendy Garrick, trapped with a monstrous husband, desperately needs saving, and Millie is determined to do everything in her power to rescue her. However, this time, the villain she confronts may prove to be more formidable than she ever imagined. To make matters worse, a relentless stalker is watching her every move. Is this threat connected to the Garrick family, or is something even more sinister lurking in the shadows, poised to threaten her life?Anticipating the big twist due to the first book's concept, I found the execution of these twists to be incredibly clever, with certain aspects even surpassing those in the first book. Upon finishing the book in a single sitting, I was so close to screaming and demanding another installment! I'm keeping my fingers tightly crossed that Freida McFadden won't keep us waiting too long for the next dance—or perhaps many more dances—in Millie's thrilling adventures. These books have become my new addiction, and I wholeheartedly recommend them to any reader in search of riveting, exhilarating, and breathtaking page-turners.I'm upgrading my rating from 4.5 stars to a solid 5, thanks to the clever twists, and eagerly looking forward to delving into more of the author's twisted tales sooner rather than later.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Dare I say that I liked this book more than The Housemaid?! Once again, McFadden delivered with some mindless entertainment (if you’re looking for a literary masterpiece, this isn’t the book). I was kept turning the pages, and not seeing all the different twists coming (like I did in the previous book).A brief summary… Our favorite housemaid, Millie returns to work for the very wealthy Garrick household. Douglas Garrick seems to be a nice man, but his wife Wendy does not leave the guest room. This seems very odd to Millie, and some strange occurrences start to take place.Once again, is Millie imagining things? Is Millie overstepping her boundaries once again? And why does she feel that someone has been following her? Don’t worry- all will be revealed with some surprising twists!Yes, there were a few discrepancies that I caught while reading this (but who’s counting, 😉), so I’m going with 4.5 stars rounded up. I will say that I do hope we see Millie again in a third book 🤞.

Freida McFadden has shown she can engage readers with suspenseful and surprising plots. The author followed the same formula here, but I didn't find it as compelling as the first book. The characters were mainly unlikeable, except for Brock (Brocolli). I found myself feeling sorry for the way Millie treated him. She needed someone more exciting and considered him boring and too predictable.Millie has a great deal of sympathy for abused women and will do anything to ensure they escape from harmful situations and by using any means necessary. Unfortunately, she often goes too far, further complicating the situation. She felt greater entitlement this time, and I found her more annoying.She is working in a fabulous penthouse apartment owned by a wealthy man. The home is immaculate, with little cleaning necessary, only cooking, laundry, and shopping for groceries. Her wages are generous. The man of the house has warned her never to enter his wife's room as she is ill. Of course, Millie's curiosity and contrary behaviour causes her to open that door.

No suelo ser fan de las segundas partes y empecé este libro... con miedo. El primero me había sorprendido muchísimo y no sabía por dónde la autora sería capaz de innovar. Pero, a mi gusto, lo logró 100%.En esta segunda parte, Freida mantiene su estilo característico: capítulos cortos con finales enganchantes, narrativa fácil y una sensación de suspenso constante que te tiene con el alma colgando en un hilo... PERO a eso le sumó, mayor misterio (mucho más que en el primer libro), más terror (por suerte no leí las últimas 30 páginas en la noche) y le agrega más frialdad al personaje de Millie en una combinación que me pareció mega acertada (De verdad es un personaje al que ""amodio"" por sus rarezas/torpeza y su buen corazón).Probablemente, este no sea el thriller más complejo y completo que leerás en tu vida. Pero me encaaaaanta como entretiene y que la autora sea capaz de mantenerme con ganas de seguir leyendo TODO el tiempo.

Just when I thought I had things figured out, McFadden shocked me with brilliant twists and turns. This book was a well written fast paced thriller which I devoured.If you have not read,The Housemaid, I highly recommend it. This book does work nicely as a standalone but reading the first book gives you more insight into Millie and her need to help others. Millie is an interesting and fully fleshed out character. She has a prison record and takes whatever jobs she can to make ends meat. She it tough and vulnerable at the same time. She also tends to get into some interesting and tense situations.I found this book to be captivating, well thought out, perfectly paced and tense.

La mala costumbre
",Alana S. Portero,4.55,16533,7663,"Queer, Fiction, LGBT, Spain, Contemporary, Feminism, Spanish Literature",252,03-05-2023,"Narrada desde una singular y desgarradora voz en primera persona, La mala costumbre recorre la adolescencia de una niña atrapada en un cuerpo que no sabe habitar, que intenta comprenderse a sí misma y al mundo en el que vive, desde su infancia en una familia de clase obrera en el barrio de San Blas, arrasado por la heroína en los años ochenta, hasta las noches clandestinas en el centro de Madrid de los noventa. Como en una versión bastarda del viaje del héroe, yonquis, divas pop y ángeles caídos la acompañan en un viaje vital en el que, al final, serán otras mujeres quienes le ayuden a superar la violencia que encuentra a cada paso.La mala costumbre es una novela cruda y feroz, pero también poética y conmovedora, en la que los extremos se tocan para mostrarnos por qué el resentimiento y la rabia contra el sistema son completamente válidos para sobrevivir en una sociedad que no acepta a los que son diferentes.","[{'rating': 5, 'content': '«Esto es lo nunca visto». Ese es el primer pensamiento que se me vino a la mente una vez leídas las primeras páginas de esta novela. El resto del libro me confirmó que mi primera impresión era acertada. Esta novela es lo nunca visto (porque pocas veces he leído textos tan bien enhebrados, tan afilados, tan acogedores) y, por lo que habla, podríamos decir que trata de lo nunca visto (porque sus personajes, sus marginalidades, sus vivencias y sencillas aspiraciones no son casi nunca protagonistas de la gran literatura). Mil, dos mil páginas habría leído de esta novela que me he tenido que dosificar (solo dos capítulos por sesión de lectura y solo los días en los que tenía los sentidos al 100%) por ser consciente de que solo una vez la podría leer por primera vez.A modo de constelaciones familiares de gente que no se toca nada pero que ha vivido lo mismo, Alana Portero cuenta una historia de clase social, adolescencia y descubrimiento de la propia identidad de género en el Madrid de los años 80. Y lo hace de una manera única: convirtiendo lo más ordinario, lo más prosaico, lo más gris... en único, extraordinario, legendario. Una chica trans va creciendo y asumiendo quien es y, en su camino, como en una novela de caballerías, como en un folletín de aventuras, se encuentra con personajes que le susurran verdades, que le muestran el futuro, que le enseñan el camino. «La mala costumbre» es una novela eminentemente social, en la que la clase y la cuna son las canalizadoras de casi todo lo que pasa, pero es también, de alguna forma, un relato mitológico. Un aire de leyenda le da vida al gris escenario en el que nos hemos criado todas las personas de clase trabajadora y hace que la barriada se convierta en un escenario mítico. Porque cualquier lugar es Delfos cuando está habitado por hechiceras.En «La mala costumbre» está Allen Ginsberg y Capote y Camila Sosa y Lemebel, sobre todo Lemebel. Porque Alana nos ha regalado a una nueva Loca del frente: tan frágil y decidida, tan lúcida y desastrosa, tan valiente y asustada. Portero ha hecho historia. Su libro se va a convertir en el éxito internacional que merece ser. Y ella está a punto de entrar al Olimpo de quienes escriben algo que cambia un poquito el mundo.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Me he quedado colgadísimo de este libro y de su autora. Se pueden decir tantas cosas de él que no sé bien por dónde empezar, así que solo señalar que fue una compra impulsiva tras escuchar en algún lado que era bueno, leer un par de páginas de las que se ofrecen de muestra para testarlo y recibir un puñetazo de los gordos en todos los sentidos. No es que el libro fuera bueno, es que era buenísimo. Excepcional. Y pensé: bueno, son solo unas paginas de vértigo, después bajará a la biblioteca de los libros mortales, como los demás. Pues no. La novela no se cae del paraíso y encima no te empacha.Adelanto que no sabía cuál era la temática y mejor, porque habría pensado que era una novela de moda y oportunista y habría pasado. Es un libro excepcional y delicioso y muchas cosas más que mejor que el lector descubra por sí mismo, que no soy yo de spoilers.Un gran acierto. Ojalá muchos más.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '""La mala costumbre es una novela cruda y feroz, pero también poética y conmovedora, en la que los extremos se tocan para mostrarnos por qué el resentimiento y la rabia contra el sistema son completamente válidos para sobrevivir en una sociedad que no acepta a los que son diferentes"".Dura, desgarradora, tierna y conmovedora.¿Qué me ha gustado del libro?Nos dice Alana S. Portero Alana S. Portero:""No dejaré que le pongan la etiqueta LGTB a mi novela para hacerla pequeña, porque no lo es"", y lleva razón, porque es una gran novela.La autora nos narra lo que fue crecer en San Blas, un barrio obrero de la periferia de Madrid, considerado conflictivo, en los años ochenta y noventa del pasado siglo. Viviendas humildes, falta de infraestructuras y el azote de la heroína que acabó con toda una generación. En este contexto, transcurre la infancia y adolescencia de la protagonista, una niña trans, que no se atreve a decir que lo es. Alana S. Portero hila ambos temas de maravilla, lo que es la vida cotidiana en el barrio y los sentimientos de una niña de ese barrio atrapada en un cuerpo que no sabe habitar.El libro está escrito en una primera persona muy potente. Nos transmite la dureza de las situaciones que describe, pero también emotividad y ternura. Es una novela que narra y es una novela de retratos.El retrato del San Blas de aquellos años es impecable. El barrio y sus gentes, un microcosmos en sí mismo. Como ya he comentado, Alana, lo describe con crudeza y cariño a un tiempo. Gente obrera, como los padres de la protagonista, que trabajaba de sol a sol para sacar adelante a su familia. Gente diversa, aceptada por unos y señalada por otros. Y mala gente, maltratadores y abusadores a los que la cultura patriarcal imperante, dentro y fuera del barrio, dejaba campar a sus anchas.Igualmente bueno, el retrato del Madrid de los ochenta y los noventa. La estampa que nos dibuja es realista, describe Madrid como era, como es, con su grandeza y sus debilidades, y lo hace desde su sentimiento de ser madrileña. El amor de la autora por su ciudad es innegable y contagioso. Me quedo con su descripción del Chueca aperturista naciente y sobre todo con los paseos de vuelta a casa de la protagonista que recorría a pie el camino que la separaba del centro hasta su barrio.El retrato de la infancia y la adolescencia de la protagonista, cuando todavía no tenía un nombre con el que identificarse. Me deja una infinita sensación de tristeza la soledad con la que crecían los niños y niñas trans. La protagonista sabe del rechazo que suscitan y la violencia a la que se exponen los que no caben en la categoría de binario y heterosexual. Durante muchos años opta por no hablar de ello con su familia, por no salir del armario. Lleva una doble vida, la de quien no es en un cuerpo que no comprende de día y la de la noche cuando se transmuta en quien quiere ser. Esa doble vida la desgarra y, desde su adolescencia, le repercutirá a nivel escolar, laboral y de salud mental.El retrato de los personajes secundarios, Margarita, Eugenia, Jay, Antonio. Esa otra familia que sabe quién es ella, con la que sí puede hablar.El final. El retrato de una catarsis.En conclusión. Una novela dura y conmovedora, que me ha tocado la fibra y me ha gustado más de lo que esperaba cuando la compré. Recomendable.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Obra maestra, si pudiera le pondría 10 estrellas. Qué manera de escribir tiene Alana, qué manera predicas y filosa de hacernos llorar con una niña que no quiere ser niño.

Ojalá pudiera desleerla para volver a leerla.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Dicen que leer te hace mejor persona.Personalmente diría que leer algunos libros en concreto tienen el potencial de hacerte mejor persona si te abres y consigues conectar con lo que te cuenta la historia. Y este es uno de ellos.No sé muy bien qué decir de este libro que me ha emocionado en muchas de sus partes, me ha hecho ver la vida de otras formas que me eran ajenas, me ha hecho sufrir con las injusticias que en él aparecen, me ha hecho desear con todas mis fuerzas un mundo mejor para todas las personas que habitamos en él.Cómo una persona puede contar semejante sufrimiento con una sensibilidad y un cariño hacia todo lo que representa la vida y la libertad como lo hace la autora. Cómo se puede mantener viva la llama de la esperanza en un mundo tan hostil. Cómo puede hacer que se te caigan las lágrimas no sabes muy bien si por tristeza, rabia o belleza, o todo a la vez. Cómo puedes salir de esta historia indemne.Imposible mirar para otro lado después de leer esta novela.Imposible negar lo que es tan real.Maravilloso libro, maravillosa autora.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '“La mala costumbre” narra la vida de una niña trans desde su más tierna infancia hasta que alcanza la madurez, plasmando el proceso que conlleva sentirse atrapada en un cuerpo que no siente que le pertenezca, rodeada del desprecio de los demás hacia la existencia de otras mujeres como ella. Esta niña crecerá en los años 80 en un pequeño barrio obrero asolado por la heroína. Una época de cambios pero aún llena de prejuicios, no tan alejada aún de la dictadura y de la represión que esta produjo, y que sigue teniendo consecuencias a día de hoy.Me va a costar explicar lo especial que me ha parecido este libro. Alana maneja la palabra como pocas veces he visto, su escritura te absorbe completamente, te lleva de la mano por todas sus páginas, estrujándote el corazón a cada momento. Hace magia con cada palabra, con cada frase, con cada párrafo. Sumergirme en su escritura ha sido toda una experiencia, todo un revoltijo de emociones, te lleva de la felicidad a la tristeza, de la ternura a la impotencia, de la ilusión al dolor. Me alucinan esos autores que son capaces de provocar en el lector tantas emociones a la vez.Me he sentido completamente comprendido por las reflexiones que compartía la autora a través de su protagonista. De alguna manera he encontrado respuesta a las ideas y las reflexiones que el Jesús niño se hacía sobre muchos temas, especialmente en relación a como las personas te tratan cuando te sienten diferente, lo vulnerables que son los niños ante muchos de los comentarios y actitudes de los adultos, ya que estos pueden llegar a destruir la confianza y la seguridad de una mente que aún está formándose, que aún está buscando encontrarse, descubrirse.El libro ha conseguido emocionarme en cada capítulo y no han sido pocas las lágrimas que me ha sacado. A través de las páginas, conoceremos a diferentes personas que influyeron en la vida de esta niña de alguna manera u otra, y, en especial, se centrará en varias mujeres en las que nuestra protagonista encuentra un espejo donde mirarse. Parecerse a estas mujeres primero la asusta, ya que ve como la sociedad las trata, pero pronto se convierten en su aliento, en su refugio. A través de ellas va aprendiendo a conocerse, a aceptarse. El libro desprende sororidad a raudales, mostrando de una manera increíblemente dulce como se apoyan y quieren estas mujeres las unas a las otras.Es un historia muy dura, escrita con una prosa muy bella, pero muy cruda, que resulta de vital importancia en la actualidad. Pese a que a veces no lo parezca, por la barbaridad de cosas que aún tiene que aguantar la comunidad LGTBIQ+, es cierto que se ha conseguido mucho, pese a que la amenaza de tiempos más oscuros siempre aparezca por el horizonte. Por eso, libros como “La mala costumbre” son tan necesarios, porque consiguen mostrar a la perfección todo lo que podemos perder, a donde podemos volver. Es imposible no empatizar con nuestra protagonista, con esa voz que quiere vivir con ilusión, pero siente que se la tratan de quitar a cada paso que da. Sin embargo, sigue avanzado, como ha visto hacer a muchas otras mujeres. Porque si algo define a la comunidad LGTBIQ+ es la resiliencia, esa capacidad de seguir, de sobreponerse, y la autora expresa esto muy bien.Solo me queda ya recomendarlo encarecidamente a todo el mundo. Se lo recomendaría a todo el que viva la lucha en sus propias carnes y a todo al que la comprenda y la apoye, pero también se lo recomendaría a todo aquel al que la empatía se le resiste, al que todavía no lo entiende o no quiere entenderlo. Si ni siquiera se curan de la falta de empatía con la prosa de Alana, con su habilidad para darle sentido y significado a todo lo que muchos hemos sentido o pensado mientras crecíamos, es que no tienen remedio. Leed este libro, por favor, leedlo.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'No hay palabras suficientes para describir el viaje por el que esta lectura me hizo vivir.En un principio sentí que estaba leyendo relatos organizados cronológicamente, cuyo propósito era contar los episodios claves en el crecimiento de una niña y cómo ciertos acontecimientos terminan formando a un ser humano. Sin embargo, a medio camino me di cuenta que este era un libro cuya historia iba más allá. Hay un punto sin retorno, en donde la infancia se desvanece hacia una dolorosa adolescencia, y sin darte cuenta te encuentras leyendo el escondite de los sentimientos y miedos íntimos de una chica reprimida.Me vi conmovida por cómo una persona expresa sin tapujos su necesidad incipiente por pertenecer y ser amada, aunque eso implique ser infeliz. Me vi conmovida por una historia de la que, aunque no fuera escrita para mí (una chica normativa más), me llenaba el corazón que fuera para todas aquellas chicas cuyas historias son olvidadas o invisibilizadas. Me gustaría destacar, personalmente, todas esas referencias mitológicas que servirían como parta aguas e incluso de presagio, de lo que algunos personajes tendrán que pasar. Fue un detalle que me encantó leer y que le otorgaría un toque místico a la narración, casi como si se tratara de una leyendo solemne. Muy bello de leer.Una vez estas dentro del contexto social, el libro te come. Está tan bien situado y descrito que te sientes dentro de él. Las calles de Madrid se vuelven protagonistas, más allá de ser el escenario en que el se desarrolla esta historia, para darle forma a una protagonista formidable, sensible y compleja, una cuya fuente de aprendizaje son las personas que va conociendo por el camino y que se vuelven fundamentales para descubrirse así misma. Son las calles quienes la forman, le dan un lugar seguro e incluso son testigos de sus más dolorosos golpes.Esta es una novela atronadora, que una vez la terminas se queda contigo días.

Es un libro pertinente y necesario en los tiempos que vivimos, un libro que se adentra en lo confesional y lo confesional no puede ser evaluado en términos habituales. ¿Cómo voy a juzgar yo si las experiencias de alguien no son valiosas?¿Cómo decir que lo que alguien quiere decir es malo o feo?Ahora bien, si nos centramos en lo literario este libro me parece bastante limitado. Por momentos incluso mal escrito, con expresiones manidas, incluso con errores de expresión, con redundancias... me sorprendió que un editor no propusiera modificar determinados fragmentos que, bueno, no serían aceptables en cursos de escritura. Por ejemplo, esa visita de la protagonista al café de Chueca con su primer amante. No puedo plasmar lo poco que me gustó ese momento. O, y esto ya quizá es personal, que en un libro de diga ""es bajo de estatura"" ya me saca por completo. ¿De qué va a ser bajo en una descripción física?¿De batería?Otro error desde mi punto de vista es que la protagonista siente mucho, sí, pero me lo explica. Me dice cómo se siente con muchas palabras, le da vueltas, lo adorna... pero yo de una novela espero que me lo muestren y no me lo expliquen. Además, tengo problemas con la voz en primera persona, sobre todo cuando narra la infancia (que por otro lado es lo mejor de la novela con diferencia). No me queda claro si me lo cuenta elyo niñao elyo adulta, y hay momentos en los que la niña tiene pensamientos y reflexiones que no son propios de una niña. (Qué difícil es escribir con la voz de un niño/a, en cualquier historia)También me ha parecido que los personajes que rodean a la protagonista son bastante planos, unidimensionales, son malos malísimos o buenos buenísimos sin apenas entender sus motivaciones. Lo del Marrano, por ejemplo, parece una caricatura sin más. La Moraíta es retratada casi como una santa, una hagiografía.

Y sobre todo que sean voces autorizadas por su experiencia vital.No te atrevas si:para ti lo literario debe prevalecer sobre lo testimonial o confesional y no te gusta que te digan obviedadesTe gustará si:(esto cogedlo con pinzas, porque no estoy seguro) vibraste con la serie Veneno o Las malas, de Camila Sosa (aunque cualquiera de las dos es mucho mejor)'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Mi mejor lectura en lo que va de año.La manera de escribir de Alana, cruda pero poética; directa pero alegórica; me ha cautivado; y la historia que cuenta, prácticamente autobiográfica, tiene la capacidad de conmover y de interpelar directamente al lector, aunque sus vivencias y circunstancias no coincidan exactamente con las de la autora. Y es que hay algo universal que se entreve en todas las historias de desarrollo que se centran en los detalles más mundanos (el barrio, la familia, los vecinos, el primer amor...). De esta historia se pueden extraer muchas lecturas pero quizá una de las más importantes es la de darnos cuenta de que todos somos muy similares, que nuestros miedos, anhelos, necesidades no distan tanto unos de otros, que sin referentes no somos apenas nada, y que solo siendo nosotros mismos podemos aspirar a vivir de verdad.

Set in a working class area of Madrid in the 1980s forwards, this has something of the vibe ofMy Brilliant Friendwith added queerness.The writing is frequently gorgeous, the voice alternates between the sassy and the oppressed, and characters are delineated with impressive vividness, even when they are only sketched in like a bar owner, Antonio, in the gay district with his photos of all his beloved friends lost to, it's implied, AIDS/HIV.There's so much pain, confusion and anguish in this book but the suffering is offset by the love of the narrator's parents, her brother, and her own joy in beauty. Margarita is a standout character whose own tragic constraints serve as both conduit for the narrator's healing compassion and catalyst for her own final embracing of herself.Lyrical, big-hearted without being sentimental, and involving, this feels like a breakthrough voice that we don't often hear in mainstream literature.Many thanks to 4th Estate for an ARC via NetGalley.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Tenía razón todo el mundo cuando decía que este es uno de los libros no ya del año sino de la década.

Pues que es tan bonita como dura, triste y desgarradora. Su viaje es inolvidable. Y la gente de los barrios madrileños que la acompañan también. Hacía tiempo que no leía un libro que retratase tan bien la vida de barrio española de los años 90. Recomiendo muchísimo que os hagáis con una prueba gratuita de Pódimo o Audible para que podáis disfrutar el audiolibro, porque lo que vuelve a hacer Alana poniéndole voz a sus palabras escritas es algo mágico y conmovedor.

Mientras leía recorrí un barrio obrero lleno de esquinas grises, donde la protagonista intenta encontrarse mientras el entorno se empeñaba en aplastarla. Alana logra retratar ese contexto con crudeza y una sinceridad brutal, mostrándonos de primera mano el odio, la incomprensión y la violencia a la que se enfrentaba alguien que se salía de la norma de la época.Alana tiene una forma de escribir que va directa al grano, sin maquillar el sufrimiento ni endulzar la realidad. Lo que ella plasma es tan visceral y tangible que a veces quería cerrar el libro y tomar aire, pero al mismo tiempo no podia dejar de leer. La protagonista va navegando entre el rechazo de su propia familia, la dureza del barrio y el desprecio de una sociedad que no sabe aceptar la diferencia. No es una historia para quienes busquen un relato optimista o fácil; es un golpe en el estómago y, a la vez, una invitación a mirar de frente una realidad incómoda.Pero no todo es sufrimiento en esta historia y ahí está lo que la hace tan especial. Entre tanto dolor y enfrentamientos, aparecen lazos humanos que sostienen a la protagonista. Son esos momentos de amistad y apoyo mutuo los que me aliviaron la lectura y le dieron un toque esperanzador, porque, al final, la novela trata también de la resiliencia y del poder de las relaciones que uno elige. Alana nos muestra que, aunque el entorno sea hostil, uno puede construir una familia de quienes eligen quedarse y compartir la carga.La mala costumbre es una novela que vale la pena leer si uno está dispuesto a exponerse a una historia dura, a momentos tristes, pero profundamente real.

""El Animal Salvaje"" se despliega ante nosotros como una intrincada tela de araña, tejida con hilos de apariencias engañosas, envidias de clase, complejas estafas y atracos audaces. Esta novela es un thriller que te atrapa desde la primera página, creando un vértigo literario que hace imposible soltar el libro. Confieso que devoré sus páginas con avidez, consumiendo cien tras cien en cada sentada, hasta terminarla en menos de 48 horas.Sin embargo, lo que distingue a ""El Animal Salvaje"" de sus predecesores no es solo su trama absorbente. En este libro, Dicker nos sorprende con dos cambios notables respecto a su estilo característico. Primero, el elenco de personajes es sorprendentemente reducido, lo que nos permite profundizar en ellos. Segundo, aunque Dicker mantiene su firma narrativa de jugar con múltiples líneas temporales, en esta ocasión, los saltos son notablemente más intuitivos y fáciles de seguir. Este ajuste es un alivio bienvenido y un cambio en su técnica que, para mi modo de ver, enriquece la experiencia de lectura.Totalmente recomendable, Dicker mantiene su esencia en esta novela. La historia ofrece diversión y suspense en medidas iguales.

Dicker non mi ha mai colpito per la prosa (sempre piatta e banale) ma questo libro non solo sembra una bozza ma manca anche di ciò che almeno si trovava negli altri romanzi e che compensava la debolezza dello stile di scrittura : i colpi di scena, la suspance e il ritmo serrato delle indagini che rendevano i suoi romanzi dei pageturner.

No estamos ante una novela de negra con una investigación, sino que la trama gira en torno a un atraco, pero el tema principal de la historia es poner de manifiesto, por un lado, el peligro de vivir de las apariencias, y por otro, el de quien se cree solo conociendo una parte del todo, que la vida de los demás es mejor que la propia. Una novela sobre la insatisfacción, la rutina (con su lado bueno y su versión más oscura) y las parejas de larga duración.Aun así, el estilo característico de Dicker sigue más que presente: capítulos cortos, muchos personajes todos con algo que esconder y algún giro más o menos inesperado. Para mi, ha sido quizá su obra menos sorprendente en relación a plot twist, pero no me voy a quejar porque en otras ocasiones he sentido que abusaba del elemento sorpresa para dejarte con la boca abierta a base de “trampas” o que renunciaba a verosimilitud para conseguirlo. ¿Puedes intuir más o menos lo que va a ocurrir? Si. ¿Eso me fastidió la lectura? No.Un par de apuntes sobre la trama… Todo sucede en Ginebra y los protagonistas serán dos matrimonios afincados en un barrio lujoso, aunque uno “vive mejor” que otro. La amistad entre ellos devendrá en una obsesión y… pasan cosas.Entonces, ¿está aquí “el mejor” Dicker? Pues cuestión de gustos. Para mí no, porque disfruto más las novelas donde construye personajes que son lo que acabo recordando más allá del misterio. Pero esta novela sin dudas da lo que promete, es un libro que no puedes soltar y muy entretenido. Entonces, si buscas acción y que pasen muchas cosas todo el rato, es tu libro.

Serán necesarios varios viajes al pasado, lejos de Ginebra, para hallar el origen de esta intriga diabólica de la que nadie saldrá indemne.Entretenimiento puro y sin otro interés, cómo ver una película un sábado noche en la que los giros se suceden sin parar y terminas satisfecho, pero que a las pocas horas ya has olvidado incluso el título de la película.Eso es lo que pienso de la nueva novela del autor superventasJoël Dicker, del que tampoco soy demasiado fan, tan sólo había leído la indispensable y muy disfrutaba""La verdad sobre el caso Harry Quebert”y""Los últimos días de nuestros padres”, una novela con un cambio de registro hacia una trama bélica en la que se mezclaban espionaje, amor, amistad y una reflexión profunda acerca del ser humano y sus debilidades, quizá la mejor novela que he leído de Dicker hasta la fecha.Con su nueva novela titulada“Un animal salvaje”, el autor suizo nos traslada a Ginebra y Saint Tropez, con acercamientos a San Marino, Londres o Zaragoza, a través de una trama que gira en torno a un atraco y a 2 parejas (y un ""añadido"") con muchos secretos.Narración en tercera persona, con prosa muy ágil y continuos saltos temporales (antes y después del atraco, desde 2007 a 2022) que hacen que la lectura sea muy rápida y que el interés no decaiga en ningún momento, de ahí que el libro se lea de una sentada (6 o 7 horas y te lo ventilas).No hay mucho más que decir en cuanto a la profundidad de los personajes ni de la trama, pues todo se ve reducido a esos continuos giros que se producen en los papeles que juega cada uno de los personajes, sobre todo de las 2 parejas protagonistas y del “tercero” en discordia, todos ellos personajes muy misteriosos y llenos de secretos, que poco a poco se van desvelando y nos van dejando alguna que otra sorpresa. El final es más o menos esperado, aunque es cierto que por el camino las sorpresas se van sucediendo, todo hace esperar ese cierre de la trama. Las descripciones de las localizaciones y de cómo se realiza el atraco y la investigación no tienen ninguna fisura y se ve que Dicker ha hilado una trama intrincada de una manera muy sutil y sin nada que reprochar, la verdad es que hay que reconocerle el gran trabajo a la hora de planificar un libro con tantos saltos temporales y en el que nada queda al azar ni ""suena raro"".Novela para pasar el rato, sin pedir nada más ni pretender encontrar un novelón, lo cierto es que el gran poder de la novela recae en la habilidad de Dicker como “contador de historias”, y aunque en esta novela cambie un poco de registro -y se pase demasiado con el salseo amoroso, demasiado para mi gusto- el resultado es aceptable y muy disfrutable, aún así 3 estrellas muy justitas son más que suficientes.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Nici de această dată Joël Dicker nu dezamăgește!

Escrito en capítulo muy cortos, divididos a su vez en subcapítulos, intercalando los sucesos actuales con flashbacks de hechos anteriores que nos van dando contexto, su lectura se hace muy ágil y entretenida, consiguiendo que las páginas (y la historia) avancen sin darnos cuenta.Dice la sinopsis: “El 2 de julio de 2022, dos delincuentes se disponen a robar en una importante joyería de Ginebra.

Serán necesarios varios viajes al pasado, lejos de Ginebra, para hallar el origen de esta intriga diabólica de la que nadie saldrá indemne”.Dicker nos presenta una historia con pocos personajes, donde todos están perfectamente definidos y podemos identificarlos sin problema. En la trama nos encontramos un par de giros de guion que debo reconocer que me esperaba pero que cuadran perfectamente. El final, adecuado, no digo nada para no hacer spoiler pero se siente que todo queda en su sitio. En resumen, una lectura perfecta para entretenerse, sin más pretensiones, ideal para estos momentos de verano.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'A veces disfrutar de la lectura pasa por algo tan sencillo como encontrar un buen contador de historias que, además, cuente buenas historias. Parece básico pero no debe ser fácil, la mayoría de los libros que se publican están lejos de atrapar al lector al nivel de Dicker. Y más difícil aún debe ser sostenerlo en el tiempo, aunque existan borrones (por ejemplo, a mi la Desaparición de Stephanie Mailer me parece un desbarre).""Es un escritor de fórmula"" me han comentado más de una vez, lo mismo sí, mi conocimiento no me da para adoctrinar sobre esa cuestión. Pero si es así, que vengan más y escriban libros siguiendo el mismo patrón, quiero más lecturas de verano como esta. Tampoco debe ser sencillo, a veces las matemáticas están lejos de ser exactas.Esta vez Dicker nos sitúa en Europa, principalmente en Suiza, para contarnos la historia de un robo a la vieja usanza, creando tensión desde el primer minuto, sin que necesariamente esta esté centrada en el plan, ya que las relaciones entre los personajes se llevan la palma para hacernos morder sus anzuelos. Y los mordemos, quizás no todos, pero varios si que van a la boca. Como en toda su obra, en esto sí es reconocible, abundan los giros, regiros y trampas, y va zarandeando la simpatía de la persona lectora que tiene que esperar más de la mitad del libro para identificar el personaje por el que desea decantarse.Que le voy a hacer, una vez más me lo he pasado muy bien leyendo a Dicker y descubriendo los personajes que va tejiendo y las experiencias que los explican.Por poner un pero, esta vez sí que he sido capaz de anticipara algunas de sus sorpresas.

Ahora debajo del paraguas voy a intentar explicarme.Después de una irrupción llena de buenos augurios, casi todo lo que ha venido después ha sido sustentado por un primer libro bastante acertado y un fenómeno fandom desproporcionado (todo siempre desde mi opinión más subjetiva). Hay escritores que evolucionan y otros que se dedican a reescribir una y otra vez la misma historia con distinto envoltorio. La escritura puede tener alma o seguir unas pautas. Uno que es rarito prefiere la primera, y en este libro lo único que tenemos es una presentación, un nudo y un desenlace de lo más estándar. El jugar con el tiempo no es mal recurso, pero existen otros muchos que no estaría de más explorar.Los escritores no nos deben nada a los lectores y nos lo deben todo. Yo sé que no soy nadie para exigir y que cada uno cuenta sus historias como lo siente y como quiere. A mí me da ¿Pena?¿Rabia? que un talento como el de la escritura, al alcance de muy pocos se diluya en la comodidad de saber que su próximo libro se venderá solo con llevar su firma.Pero dejaré de divagar y voy a ir al libro. Se nos cuenta un atraco, pero más sobre las personas que se verán implicadas en ello. Gente perfecta con problemas de gente perfecta y gente mediocre con problemas más mundanos. Personajes con los que es difícil empatizar y más difícil aún cogerles cariño. Todo avanza hacia un desastre que parece imposible de evitar y que será resuelto sin profundizar en nada.No sé la intención del autor, si era presentarnos a personajes reales, o que en la vida no hay ni ganadores ni perdedores, solo gente actuando... Estas dudas, de si hay más de lo que he podido ver, hacen que no le dé solo dos estrellas a este libro que al menos se lee rápido y hace que quieras seguir avanzando.

El libro mezcla el presente con constantes flash backs para comprender los comportamientos de nuestro tres protagonistas.

",Sarah J. Maas,4.18,1844831,7536,"Young Adult, Romance, Fiction, Magic, Young Adult Fantasy, High Fantasy, Audiobook",406,07-08-2012,"An alternative cover edition for this ISBN can be foundhere.In a land without magic, where the king rules with an iron hand, an assassin is summoned to the castle. She comes not to kill the king, but to win her freedom. If she defeats twenty-three killers, thieves, and warriors in a competition, she is released from prison to serve as the king's champion. Her name is Celaena Sardothien.The Crown Prince will provoke her. The Captain of the Guard will protect her. But something evil dwells in the castle of glass—and it's there to kill. When her competitors start dying one by one, Celaena's fight for freedom becomes a fight for survival, and a desperate quest to root out the evil before it destroys her world.","[{'rating': 1, 'content': 'Are you kidding me? What the hell is this shit? How do you screw up your story quite so badly after starting from an INCREDIBLE premise involving the most notorious assassin in the land - now a slave - being offered the chance to win back her freedom, sort of, in a ""to-the-death tournament - fighting the most gifted thieves and assassins in the land"" [says the back of my book, conveniently forgetting that (a) right before the final duels, the king specifically states that the competitors ""can win only by trapping [their] opponent[s] in a position of sure death ... andno further"" soto-the-deathmy foot, and (b) apart from thieves and assassins, a number of the competitors are actually ex-guards and random other criminals, for the most part disposable enough not to warrant names, and I\'d only consider a small handful of them to begiftedat anything]? I mean, you really have to be TALENTED to go from all of *that* Exciting Sounding Awesomeness to - well - toThrone of Glass.After reading the Q & A included in the back of my book, though, it all started to make sense, and I wish I\'d knownbeforebuying this stupid-ass book that it\'s inspired byDISNEY\'S CINDERELLA, of all things. I know what you\'re thinking:Where the fridge tart doesCinderellacome in? Isn\'t this story about, like, a TOUGH-AS-NAILS former-assassin-now-slave competing for her life in, like, the most badass tournamentever?Well ... actually, no. And I\'m happy to spend the next few hours of my life quoting this most dumbass book if it means AT LEAST ONE PERSON might decide not to waste their money on it, no need to thank me.\'""Wake up."" Not surprisingly, it was Chaol.She shimmied beneath the blankets, pulling them over her head, but he grabbed the covers and threw them to the floor. Her nightgown was wrapped around her thighs. Celaena shivered.""It\'s cold,"" she moaned, holding her knees to her body. She didn\'t care that she had only a few months to beat the other Champions - she neededsleep.[Nope, this isn\'t your bratty kid sister, but the most notorious assassin EVAH! You know, the one who - after slaving away in the salt mines for four months - was so desperate to escape that she even tried a mad suicide dash. What the hell, though; they\'reonlyoffering herher freedom.]It would have been nice if the Crown Prince had considered springing her from Endovier earlier so she could havesometime to regain her strength; how long had he known about this competition, anyway?[Sheesh. I know, right? Silly Crown Prince, not considering the feelings of, like, one of the most terrible criminals his men have ever captured. I mean, he gives you large, comfortable living quarters in his castle, a billiards table, a chance to change your life, even apuppy, and - what - he thinks this is enough?!]""Get up."" Chaol ripped the pillows from beneath her head. ""Now you\'re wasting my time."" If he noticed how much skin she was showing, he didn\'t react.[That wasn\'t irrelevant at all ... ]Grumbling, Celaena slithered to the edge of the bed, dangling a hand over the edge to touch the floor. ""Fetch my slippers,"" she mumbled. ""The floor\'s like ice.""[Yeah, put those servants in their place, Cinderella!]...From the doorway, Chaol asked, ""Why, might I ask, are you so tired?""She gulped down the rest of the pomegranate juice and wiped her mouth on a napkin. ""I was up until four reading,"" she said.\'[Why do you even have to ask, Chaol? It\'s only the start of the tournament of Celaena\'s life; of course she stayed up all night reading. SLEEP WHEN YOU\'RE DEAD, YO!! If the competition barely merits any page time, why should the competitors actually give a shit about it?!]\'A few minutes later, Celaena frowned at herself as she hurried after the captain into the foyer. ""I look ridiculous! These pants are absurd, and this shirt is awful.""\'[Way to be descriptive, Cinderella! Generic complaints FTW! It\'s not like you\'ve been slaving in the salt mines for a year, or anything like that, OF COURSE YOUR CLOTHES MATTER and HOW DARE THEY?! DON\'T LET THE BASTARDS GRIND YOU DOWN!!?!!?!!]\'""You expect me to use a mace an hour after sunrise?""\'[The horror!]\'She bit into an apple. It was tart, with a sweet, honey-like aftertaste. ""Oh? And what books do you love?"" He named a few, and she blinked. ""Well, those are good choices - for the most part. What others?"" she asked, and somehow, an hour flew by, carrying them on the wings of conversation.\'[Jesus. This paragraph isn\'t a pointless waste of space at all.]\'There was something girlish about her, too. Oh, he couldn\'t stand her contradictions!\'[INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS!!! Because *my* Chaol doesn\'t have a va-jay-jay ... ]\'Celaena bit down her laugh. Archery? It was anarcherycontest?\'[Yeah, that was my reaction, too ... ]\'Pelor, the gangly assassin, wasn\'t yet strong enough to manage a longbow, and barely made any shots. When he finished, his eyes gleaming with resentment, the Champions sniggered, and Cain laughed the loudest....Despite herself, Celaena felt badly for the boy. His shots hadn\'t beenthatbad.\'[Yeesh! If barely making any shots isn\'t *that* bad, I can see howCINDERBRATis the world\'s scariest assassin.]\'""Why would she kill me? I think she likes being pampered.[*snort*]If she hasn\'t attempted to escape or kill anyone, then why would she do it now?"" He patted his friend on the shoulder. ""You worry too much.""\'[ZOMG! U NVR HERD OFBIDING UR TIMEB4? This Crown Prince is clearly not the brightest crayon in the box.]\'Sam. What would he make of all this?\'[Since he\'s never been mentioned before, I really can\'t say. Sorry.]\'Dorian peeled himself from the wall. For all her assassinating experience, she didn\'t notice him until he sat down on the bench beside her.\'[Yeah, I can see why she\'s Most Baddest Assassinator EVAH! And who glued you to the wall, anyway, Crown Douche Bag?]\'""No. I can survive well enough on my own - if given proper reading material.""He looked at the fire, trying not to think about where she\'d been only weeks before - and what that kind of loneliness might have felt like. There were no books in Endovier.\'[I find it hard to believe thatlonelinessis your biggest problem when you\'re a beautiful seventeen-year-old girl slaving away in a salt mine, but ... what do I know? A BOOK!! A BOOK!!MY KINGDOM FOR A BOOK!!!!]\'It wasn\'t until later that Philippa brought the news. The Champion who hadn\'t shown up for the Test had been found dead in a servant\'s stairwell, brutally mauled and dismembered.The new murder cast a pall over the next two weeks, and the two Tests they brought with them. Celaena passed the Tests - stealth and tracking - without drawing much attention to herself or risking her neck to save anyone.\'[When your plot\'s so boring that you\'re summarizing it all, you\'ve got a problem ... ]\'He remained in the doorway, fearful that she\'d wake up if he took another step. Some assassin. She hadn\'t even bothered to stir.\'[I know, right? Also, you\'re a stalking stalker, Crown Douche Bag!]\'She smiled at the young chevaliers they passed - and smirked at the court women who eyed her pink-and-white gown. She couldn\'t blame them; the dress was spectacular. And she was spectacular in it.\'[Bloody hell, you\'d think a year of slavery would knock the vanity right out of a girl ... ]\'The assassin pivoted around the table and took aim again. She missed. Gritting her teeth, she considered snapping the cue in half across her knee. But she\'d been attempting to play for only an hour. She\'d be incredible by midnight! She\'d master this ridiculous game or she\'d turn the table into firewood.\'[Now, now,CINDERBRAT. Temper tantrums are, like,sounbecoming.]\'""For the world\'s greatest assassin, this is pathetic,"" said Dorian, stepping from the doorway.\'[Because assassins are widely known to be proficient at billiards. What, you didn\'t know??]\'She had often wished for adventure.\'[If you spend seven years as an assassin and somehow managenotto stumble headfirst into all sorts of adventures,you\'re probably not doing it right.]\'So she\'d cheated a little, but she\'d won.\'[LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, HOLD ON TO YOUR SEATS; WE\'VE JUST HAD OUR FIRST GLIMPSE OF CELAENA ACTUALLY BEHAVING REMOTELY LIKE AN ASSASSIN!!!! And it\'s only page 240 ... ]\'It had been over three weeks since her last encounter with Elena, and she hadn\'t seen or heard her at all, despite the three Tests she\'d had, the most exciting of which being an obstacle course, which she passed with only a few minor scratches and bruises. Unfortunately, Pelor hadn\'t done so well, and had been sent home at long last. But he\'d been lucky: three other competitors had died. All found in forgotten[well, obviously notthatforgotten]hallways; all mutilated beyond recognition.\'[The plot overload! It\'s ... it\'s ... positively ... unbearable ... ]\'Amidst her worrying, another Test passed without incident or embarrassment - though she couldn\'t say the same for the soldier who\'d been sent home - and she kept up her intense training with Chaol and the other Champions.\'[WOW: So Much Story! How can I process it all?]\'""Candy!"" A large paper bag sat on a pillow, and she found that it was filled with all sorts of confectionary goodies. There was no note, not even a name scribbled on the bag. With a shrug and glowing eyes, Celaena pulled out a handful of sweets. Oh, how sheadoredcandy!Celaena issued a jolly laugh and crammed some of the candy into her mouth....""Someone,"" she said in between chews, ""isverygood to me.""\'[I just ... oh God ... I have no words! :D Cookie Monster strikes again?]\'""Of course I want her,"" Celaena said, then realized what the implications would be. ""But I want her trained. I don\'t want her urinating on everything and chewing on furniture and shoes and books. And I want her to sit when I tell her to and lay down and roll over and whatever it is that dogs do. And I want her to run - run with the other dogs when they\'re practicing. I want her to put those long legs to use.""Dorian crossed his arms as Celaena scooped up the dog. ""That\'s a long list of demands. Perhaps I should have bought you jewelry after all.""[Hold your puppies, Dorian,CINDERDIVASTILL isn\'t done.]""When I\'m training"" - she kissed the pup\'s soft head, and the dog nestled her cold nose against Celaena\'s neck - ""I want her in the kennels, training as well. When I return in the afternoon, she may be brought to me. I\'ll keep her in the night."" Celaena held the dog at eye level. The dog kicked her legs in the air. ""If you ruin any of my shoes,"" she said to the pup, ""I\'ll turn you into a pair of slippers. Understood?""\'[Jesus Christ. Is it bad that what *I* want is for someone to rend Celaena limb from limb? And why does she have a bunch of shoes, anyway? Am I the only one who remembers that she\'s a fucking FORMER-ASSASSIN-NOW-SLAVE?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!]\'Philippa huffed. ""Just don\'t tell themIhelped you when you get dragged back here.""\'[Sure, because if Celaena says nothing, they\'ll probably assume it was one of her other, non-existent maids who helped her navigate her way into her dress.]\'Frowning, Chaol watched his friend dance with the assassin. He wouldn\'t have danced with her, anyway. And he was glad he hadn\'t worked up the nerve to ask her, not after seeing the color that Duke Perrington\'s face turned upon discovering the pair.\'[WTF isthe authorChaol talking about? What actually happens five minutes prior to this is that Celaena asks him to dance and he says no. Also, this guy\'s kind of a wussy-with-a-""p"" for a Captain of the Guard. He\'s never even killed anyone before. Yeesh. Captain of the Guard, my foot.]\' ... Cain was little more than a pawn in a game to amuse the king ... \'[That\'s what they keep saying, but the king isn\'t evenpresent in the castlefor the majority of the competition, so ... ]Oh, one more thing: THE NAMES! How the heck do you pronounce Chaol? Kale? Like the cabbage? And Kaltain Rompier has to be one of the stupidest names I\'veEVERcome across. It makes me think of frolicking unicorns, or ... something. As for the main character, well, I don\'t even know what to call her. Selena? Kay-lay-na? (that\'s the one I eventually settled on, after spending half the book mentally mumbling her name) I mean, what in Erilea kind of a name is Celaena? Is it really any wonder that Nehemia eventually renames her?! Other people get normal enough names, such as Dorian and Grave and Sam and Elena and Xavier and Cain and Philippa and Verin and Ned; simple names, really. I guess the special snowflake needs a special name to go with her very special personality impairment. Don\'t even try to get me started on the place names, because I tuned them out after Eyllwe, so I have no idea how these countries / lands / coffee beans relate to one another, but I\'ll probably live.And what is even the point of the glass castle? Or the non-existentthrone of glassthat the book\'s apparently named after? Thinly-veiledCINDERELLAreferences FTW!!!! If you ask me, the author should have gone forCinderella in Candyfloss Land!, because you certainly don\'t get much more than that. I don\'t even know what Celaena spends most of the second half of the book doing. The tournament trials and murders are mentioned in passing here and there (Yesterday we threw knives! Another three people were eaten over the past three weeks!) and the book focuses on - I don\'t know what - Celaena sitting in her room, Celaena fawning over herself in front of one mirror or another, Celaena boasting about her amazing assassin skills that you\'d otherwise never know she had, Celaena going for walks, Celaena admiring pouffalicious dresses,CinderellaCelaena wishing someone would invite her to the ball, Celaena eating sweets, Evil King being evil, and Frolicking Unicorn being high. It\'s ... exciting stuff. Really.Also, since when do slaves have possessions? Why does some random slave (whoimmediatelygets murdered by some random people, so yay for the Drama Llama) have enough salve to pass around as required? Who makes this salve? From what? Who are these slaves allowed to associate with that they can procure salve? What do they trade for this salve? Their bodies? Their hair? Salt they\'ve squirrelled away from the mines? Yeesh! Explain yourself, Sarah J. Maas!UGH! Terrible, terrible, horrendous. Nonsensical, stupid, pointless. Fluffy, pathetic, ridiculous. Need I say more? Really? Need I?Throne of Glasstries to emulatePoison Study... and fails ...spectacularly. Save yourself the torture and go straight forPoison Study. If you\'ve already readPosion Study, read it again.

Happy Reading:)'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'It feels likeThrone of Glasshas been a book I\'ve been thinking about maybe reading for a million years. The reviews and ratings from my GR friends on this book are very mixed and I can easily see why after finishing this entertaining but disappointingly tame and romance-y young adult fantasy.Throne of Glassis likeShadow and Boneround two. The premise is awesome for both: full of hardcore warriors/assassins, royal/noble secrets and scandals, a touch of magic... but each one, though entertaining, quickly hangs up its weapons and becomes far more concerned with dresses, bitchiness and whether or not that sexy dude thinks the MC is hot (he does).This book is to the fantasy genre whatTwilightis to vampires; though I have to stress that it is a fast-paced, compelling read and Maas does tame fantasy as well as it can be done. Despite my frequent eyerolls and disappointment at the romantic turn the story took, the pages seemed to fly by. I tend to read several books at once; I\'ll spend a few chapters with one and then mix it up by moving on to another, butThrone of Glassmanaged to hold my attention from start to finish with no time for interference from another book. This, in itself, was quite an achievement.Celaena Sardothien is the star of this show. A former assassin turned prisoner, she spends every day in the salt mines prison of Endovier. Having given up on hoping for freedom, she wishes only for death. That is, until one day The Crown Prince (Dorian) and his Captain of the Guard (Chaol) arrive with a proposition for her - fight in a competition, win, become the King\'s Champion for four years, and finally earn her freedom. It\'s an offer Celaena can\'t refuse. But, of course, things aren\'t that simple. Some dark evil is at work inside the King\'s castle; something that is killing off the competitors one by one. Plus, there\'s the handsome Prince and moody Captain to deal with too.I don\'t think Celaena is in the King\'s palace for a day before she starts obsessing over her looks, her new dresses and whether or not either or both of the aforementioned men find her attractive. She still manages to have more badassery than Alina inShadow and Boneand the book is, in my opinion, nowhere near as boring asGrave Mercy. But, still, I couldn\'t help being like ""BUT you said ASSASSIN!"" when she\'s there swanning around in front of the mirror. I like that she\'s ""feminine"" (whatever you want to take that to mean) as well as a brutal killer, but there\'s only so much high school changing rooms behaviour I can take. I think there\'s an excellent quote, a question that Celaena wonders to herself, that basically sums up what was running through my head for a lot of this novel:""How had she gone from the most feared prisoner in Endovier to this sappy mess?""How, indeed. But, that being said, I really enjoyed the banter between her and Chaol. And Dorian wasn\'t bad either. I\'ve said it before but I\'ll say it again for the benefit of this review: I actually don\'t mind love triangles when they\'re convincing and both candidates for the MC\'s heart are on equal footing so there\'s some tension over who they\'re going to end up with. Though I may have to do all kinds of evil things - like... stomping around my bedroom angrily or letting library books become overdue - if Celaena doesn\'t end up with Chaol. Ms Maas, you\'ve been warned.So, yes, I will be readingCrown of Midnight, god help me. I\'m hoping it will please me more than the sequel toShadow and Bonedid, but the ending of this does make me think the second book could have more action and nastiness (yes!). I think you can enjoy this book if you go into it knowing exactly what you\'re letting yourself in for. It isn\'t high fantasy. It isn\'t mind-blowing. But it is kinda fun *grins*'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Madre mía, ¿por qué no he leído esto antes?Por fin, y después de casi diez años, me he puesto manos a la obra con el primer libro de la sagaTrono de Cristalde Sarah J Maas. ¿Me arrepiento de no haberla comenzado antes? Rotundamente sí. Qué pedazo pistoletazo de salida para una obra tan grande, y qué de sorpresas me he llevado… Venga, vamos por partes.En líneas generales,considero queTrono de Cristaltiene un buen ritmo.No recae demasiado en descripciones pesadas, porque si lo hace es usualmente importante en algún momento más adelante. Hay unmuy buen equilibrio entre la duración de los capítulos, las escenas, los diálogos, momentos de introspección de los personajes y momentos de acción.Creo que está todo cuadrado al dedillo y hace que te sumerjas en la historia sin ninguna complicación.Celaena es un PEDAZO DE PERSONAJE.Enamorado de ella desde el primer momento, en serio. No solo es decidida y se la sudan completamente cosas como la monarquía, sino que es despiadada, sangrienta, extremadamente inteligente y curiosa, y la mejor asesina del reino.Es brutal.Sin embargo, también tiene su corazoncito, y ese punto de inflexión en su personalidad me ha terminado de encandilar.Personajes como Nehemia, Dorian o Chaol construyen un universo alrededor de Calaena que me fascina.Cada uno de ellos está muy bien definido, conectas con ellos, sus emociones y sentimientos, y creo que todos aportan algo a la trama de una manera u otra.Quizá he echado de menos más personajes como Nox, es decir, campeones de la competición con los que Calaena se acercara, pero lo que aportan personajes como Nehemia creo que lo compensa de sobra.El estilo de Maas no es nuevo para mí. Ya había leídoUna corte de rosas y espinas.En este caso, sin embargo, me ha entrado más fácil por los ojos. No sé si es porque es su primera novela, pero no creo que sea tan rimbombante como lo es en ACOTAR. Va más al grano, perono deja en ningún momento de escribir con esa pluma tan característica de la fantasía épica(con esto me refiero desde a uso del lenguaje a estructura concretas). Todo un acierto. La misma historia escrita de otra forma no me habría gustado tanto.Respecto a la historia...DAMN GURL!No me esperaba para dónde iba a ir la novela. Me encanta todo el tema de persona elegida que va a una competición a destacar, que es un tropo o cliché bastante visto. Sin embargo, los momentos donde se comienza a incluir magia o historia ancestral del universo donde se desarrolla la historia...Gloria bendita.Menuda sorpresa.Se me eriza el pelo pensándolo, porque no me esperaba para nada que la historia realmente tratara sobre eso y que se vaya a dirigir hacia ahí.Sé que esto es tan solo una introducción, pero estoy deseando ver hasta dónde puede llegar, porque de momento estoy fascinado.Creo quela autora presenta los elementos necesarios para comenzar a dibujar un imaginario sobre el universo creado,desde la magia hasta criaturas o leyendas antiguas, dinastías monárquicas y casas, relaciones de poder, estratos sociales o incluso economía y política. Plantea todo de una forma sencilla, fácil de captar, para desarrollarlo más profundamente en las siguientes entregas.Agradezco que no entre a trapo con esas cosas y que se centre más de momento en el personaje principal y los secundarios,porque creo que una historia sin buenos personajes, pues chica, me da igual. Así quewell done.Y bueno,el triángulo amoroso...Mira,nome ha disgustado. ¡Para mi sorpresa lo he disfrutado! Creo que las dinámicas no solo entre Calaena con los chicos, sino entre ellos mismos están muy bien pensadas y contadas.Todo es justificado y creo que Maas no peca de enamoramientos a primera vista o cosas extrañas que podemos ver en otras novelas juveniles del estilo.Las relaciones y romances parecen surgir con delicadeza pero de forma natural, y es algo que he agradecido enormemente. Deseando estoy -al igual que con la magia- de ver cómo se desarrolla.En definitiva,Trono de Cristalme parece una espectacular manera de comenzar una saga de fantasía tan extensa como esta.Me ha sorprendido y superado mis expectativas. De hecho, cerré el libro y de seguido abríCorona de Medianoche,la continuación.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""4.45/5 ⭐Full review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolf🐺I am an occasional liar. I don't lie often, but when I do lie, trust me, I might pass as a lie-detector scammer, don't test me, I'm ruthless. But in general, I prefer to be brutally honest and direct. That's my true nature.Today, I could've easily lied and said that I've wanted to read this book,Throne of Glassby Sarah J. Maas, for as long as I remember, but I’ve chosen to tell the truth instead: two months before actually reading it I’ve heard about this book and it didn’t appeal to me, mostly because of the cover somehow?? I know, I am a hypocrite (don’t judge a book by its cover, remember?), but the cover itself has (in my opinion) a crucial role in my own personal pick of a reading. And this particular cover felt like it wanted to intimidate me so bad.I actually tried to readThrone of Glassonce before, earlier in the year, and I managed to stop after preciselytwo words, change my mind and read something else. I don’t know what got into me then, but I dropped it like it’s hot, really.But boy was I wrong because I actually enjoyed it and it was VERY readable.I can’t say that I particularlylovedany of the characters, at least at the beginning. They all seemed to be so stereotypical that I quit trying to bother: the narcissistic prince, the oppressed heroine with a shady background, the wicked king scared of magic, the hard-core right hand of the narcissistic prince, the misogynistic brute etc., etc. But as the plot developed, I started liking this hard-core gorilla bodyguard with the name of Chaol, this narcissistic prince with a flirty nature, but with a real love for knowledge, this oppressed heroine which made a name for herself, but preferred to use it just to cover herself because that was a choice she could make.To be completely honest, the most beautiful relationship of them all is the one between Celaena and Princess Nehemia of Eyllwe. Their friendship is so pure and so natural that it seems like their souls have been friends since the moment the world was created. If I’d had to truly ship someone, I’d ship them both, because, let’s be real, they are, on their own, passionate, dedicated and strong women, but together, they make the perfect team. As I heard some lady in a bus saying once: “Us women are stronger when we stick together” and yes, it is so true and so accurate for Celaena’s and Nehemia’s situation too.There are two important things about a book:it has to teach you somethingandit has to help you escape your own reality. I don't know about you, people, but I read books in order to escape my own cruel reality (because that is the reality – a cruel and devious lifetime lasting wake-up call) and I recently discovered that fantasy books are the best remedy for an ordinary life. There is another life to live in a fantastic story, whenever the presented world is amazingly constructed and erected before our mind’s eye.To claim that and also deep, 7-D characters with some serious wisdom passages attached to the neatly done plotline is totally just a whole load ofbull, if you’d pardon my fluent French.I, for instance, do not judge a book by the lack of one of those aspects, but I judge it by the way it makes me feel and by how wholesome it is as an entity (and by its cover, of course!). This is maybe why almost every time I find something positive that I liked in a book that contributes to my general opinion about it. And this is also the case for this one!As the plot develops, the storyline becomes more and more intriguing until it reaches a point where things turn out dark and fantastic. What seemed to me at the beginning asokay-ishturned out to be, towards the end, a great, imaginative story. I am beyond happy that I was wrong! (That means the book is good because I rarely am wrong and I even rarely admit that Iwaswrong!).Celaena Sardothien, world’s best assassin, proves everyone that, after all, no matter how hard life beats us down, we must raise our head high up and keep fighting, because we all are beaten down by Life, but not all of us show this the same way:“We all bear scars, Dorian. Mine just happen to be more visible than most”.P.S.

Tragic past, check. Pretty, check. Amazingly good at something, check. Has more than one love interest, check.Don\'t even get me started on theloveinterests.There is absolutely no difference between Dorian and Chaol except for the fact that I\'m more leery of the name Dorian. Maybe it\'s because I just recently finishedThe Picture of Dorian Grayso whenever I see his name, I think of this:It could be me but then again, you wouldn\'t name your kid Lolita, would you?And the endingwhere Calaena breaks up with Dorian because she\'s the King\'s Champion and it would beinappropriate? We all know it\'s a ploy to squeeze in some kissy-kissy time with Chaol in the next book.

After enticing me with its promises of a reading experience reminiscent of Megan Whalen Turner and George R.R. Martin, Throne of Glass ultimately let me down. Having been excited for this novel for weeks and actually liking the sample I read, I have been brought back to earth now – with a jolt. This YA fantasy is a rather sorry example of its genre.I have the notion that a big part of this book did not work for me because of its heroine. Celeana is smart, athletic, talented and beautiful. She loves music and reading. She is fluent in different languages. She is great. And she knows it. And rubs it in your face repeatedly. As do her suitors and admirers. I had the feeling that Sarah J. Maas tried everything to make me love her heroine. How do you make readers love someone? Present them with a book lover! But somehow, she accomplished the opposite. I did not loathe Celaena, but she grated on my nerves. I wished someone would tell her off, would for once not grant her every wish; I wished the characters I liked would not fall for her charms and good looks.The little romance Celaena had (I won't say with whom) was laughable at best and mostly resulted in me rolling my eyes at the fact that the only attraction that existed between those two stemmed from them both being beautiful.In terms of plot, I cannot deny that there was always a level of suspense present. I did want to know how this story ended, and yes, there were actually parts when I feared the whole thing would not end well – partly because my beloved heroine did not deem it necessary to inform certain people about what she had witnessed in the castle. Overall, though, the story remained a tad too juvenile and simple for me. Important events were mentioned only in passing and the mythology did not go any further than what was important for the main story line. Many things remained unsaid – doubtlessly for the sake of sequels yet to come – but it was not the subtle way of remaining unsaid but hinted at I love in fantasy novels, it felt more like remaining unsaid to lure me into reading on.There were aspects I liked - Celaena's friendship to Nehemia, the Eyllwe princess, and Chaol, the loyal and fierce captain of the guard – but in the end, there isn't enough to make me interested in reading any sequels.In short - what I wanted: A less is more mentality. World building that does not only cover what is necessary to follow the main story arc. Subtle romance. Villains in different shades of grey. Assassins that actually assassinate. And do not only sit in their room talking or thinking about clothes and boys. What I got: A vain and mostly unlikeable heroine. Two men absolutely bedazzled by her presence. Hints of a love triangle. Lots and lots of descriptions of clothing. Flimsy world building. An overall poor execution writing-wise. Thank you.

I never liked the first cover, and am infinitely grateful that they changed them for the sequels. But as far as how Celaena herself is? I would say she\'s a bit of both. I feel like these covers portray two very different extremes, and Celaena seemed to possess a quality from each of them. That\'s actually what I loved about her. She\'s fast becoming one of my all-time favorite YA heroines.I\'ll admit that a long while ago, I hadn\'t expected the book to be this good.

The characters were well formed and excellently developed. There are recognisable and enjoyable twists on the classic Cinderella. Example Celaena Sardothien's fairy godmother is a ghost of an ancient warrior queen. There are also slight touches, such as Celaena having an innate charm with animals.I was also very impressed with the pacing and evolution of the story. Honestly, the 406 pages just seem to fly by. Just because Celaena was the greatest of assassins after being in a death camp for over a year, she needed to capture her old form, but her skills are still intact. Also, I like the way the author plays with her feelings. Even though she is an assassin, she is still very young and prone to her feelings and ego getting hurt.The book does leave a lot of questions, many of which are for the second novel, but as much as I hate prequels, I will have to read the backup stories on the Kindle version. I can't wait for the next book and am really looking forward to what is going to happen next.

I take full offense at badassery being missed.But seriously, guys, this book suffers from fuckingterriblecharacter work.Thesis Statement:Celaena is a badly written character.She is arrogant as hell, really petty, and somewhat obsessed with her own appearance. Andthat\'snot even the problem - a horribly unlikable assassin as a lead character could be amazing. But Celaena doesnothave enough character depth for her unlikability to be tolerable. Her alleged tragic past? Pretty much not represented on page. Frankly, tragic pasts need alotof fleshing out to be compelling and believable, and I don\'t even think Celaena\'s trauma is acknowledgedoncein this book - come on, at least do the bare minimum?Listen, okay, you want to get me started on my #1 pet peeve in YA for all eternity?Heroines that have less sense than the audience. I like my heroines to be one step ahead of me, or at my level. Let\'s talk about the fact that Celaena is just... a complete idiot.Some assassin. I am 98% sure I have more sense than this character / prop for love triangles does. Like, I\'m sorry, but how am I supposed to be intimidated by someone who 98% of the audience could outthink?I am so disappointed by all this character could have been and all this character is not. completely lighthearted. Again, that could be super enjoyable to read about! I\'d LOVE a book about a slightly unbalanced girl who murders people with a smile on her face. This could be Celaena if she were cleverer and a bit - okay, a lot - more fleshed out. But she\'s just an unbelievable, annoying heroine.And Jesus,I am so annoyed by the love triangle. Dorian is just flat as hell and has no character. Chaol is... okay, I know someone is going to fight me over this but I do not care.Chaol is an overprotective ass. I can\'t believe he\'s supposed to be the good romantic interest compared to Rowan. Jesus, how bad is Rowan?

Maas novel, and I don’t understand the hype. Warning: extremely sarcastic book review coming up!Celaena Sardothien is the world’s most famous assassin. However, she has been captured and is doing hard labor in a mine. Today is her lucky day though. The kind and absolutely dashing Prince Dorian arrives to save the day! Celaena can enter a competition to be the King’s Champion. If she wins the competition, she then has to serve four years of service under the king, and then she is free! Yippie!The concepts in this book sound right up my alley. Female characters? Yes. However, my gosh, this is probably the most unlikeable character that I have ever endured. I was hoping that someone would finish her off.Celaena is one of the least humble characters ever written. She is the female version of Gaston from Beauty and The Beast but worse. So much of the book is about, “Oh, I could take this guy down with one bat of an eye.” Give me a break. When she finally arrives for the competition, she does not seem to do any training other than what is forced on her by Prince Dorian or Chaol. If you want to be the best at something, you usually have a routine. Each day, you know exactly what to do to train and prepare.Celaena likes to sleep in and dream of kissing. I really wish that I was still producing Booktube videos because this book would make a great spoof video. I will just have to do my best to state the overexaggerated nature of Celaena.If Celaena was a book influencer, she started reading when she was three-months old. She has read a book in every state and country. She has read every book on every checklist, and she has a photographic memory. When she gets ready for a book quiz, she doesn’t even open the book to refresh her memory. And she giggles and dreams of boys kissing her. Tee-hee!The “romance” in this book is absolute cringe. One of her suitors is so struck by her beauty. Apparently, Celanea should have a GoodReads account, because nearly every day she could have the opportunity to receive creepy “hey beautiful” messages from fake accounts. This would make her swoon. Although someone can compliment a person on his or her beauty, so what? Beautiful is primarily about winning the genetic lottery. If you want to really compliment a person, say something about their work ethic, their kind and gentle nature, their thirst for knowledge, their passion to change the world.Throne of Glass is so boring. The King’s Champion has various stages to the competition. Because of the writing style, the suspense did not build. There is a stage of the competition, and it is described in a paragraph or one page. And people die in this book. However, our “world-famous” assassin Celaena does very little about it. Sucks to be them I guess. She is too busy thinking about kisses. The characters aren’t developed enough so when they die off, no one cares.This book completely lacks the strong female characters that I love. This is a love-sick assassin who doesn’t really show her full capabilities. It is really hard to take her seriously when she spends more time pouting about festivals and dreaming of kisses than preparing to win the championship.Also, anyone who has less than perfect skin is “bad” in this book. I have a real problem with this. Beauty is only skin deep, and I would rather have a partnership with someone with bad skin and has a bit of sense than someone who is “gorgeous” and can’t hold up their end of a conversation. But personal preference.Overall, the concept of a strong female assassin in a slightly fantasy setting sounds appealing; however, Sarah J. Maas did not execute it properly in Throne of Glass. If you really want a strong female character in a fantasy setting, I highly suggest The Golden Compass or Northern Lights by Philip Pullman.

I can see that. I actually could see a writing style development between the first and the second half of the book.This to say that, since from the beginning, I didn’t expect much.But since I’m here do discuss books and not to dig into the author’s background, I’ll admit I’m not a huge fan of the writing. Too many exclamation points!!!!!!too much self-indulgence in the characters descriptions and actions, and, definitely, too much walking around the edges.Sometimes I like it when a bookshowsits contents rather than shoving them explicitly into the writing as to say “hey, here’s how you’re suppose to interpret said emotion and fact”, and so on.I don't like that, nuh-uh.Plus, most of the time, it really looked and felt like a thirteen-year-old fangirl wrote a fanfiction based on scratches of books she's seen her big sister read.The plot is not bad. There’s magic and princes and the right amount of stabby-stabbing.Not bad, but not breath-taking, either. I'm not giving up, though, because I trust my fellow readers and I believe it when they say it's gonna get better.Well,Now, another thing that threw me almost completely off the Throne of Glass Train, was the main character, Celeana Sardothien.Oh, boy. I had such a hard time with this one.Not only I didn't connect with her and her way of thinking before the very last chapters, she's also made it into my Top 3 of most annoying characters thanks to her immaturity.I think only America Singer fromThe Selectionand Zoey Redbird fromMarkedcould top that, and this is saying a lot.She’s like that popular chick in high school who thinks she’s head and shoulders above the others. She’s like Regina George with daggers and an even snarkier holier-than-thou attitude.Basically Celeana in every single line ever:For someone who's supposed to be a deadly assassin, she's pretty weak and dull. I get it that she's a girl who likes being pretty and wearing nice clothes and dating hot boys (I actually love it when a female character can be girly and badass at the same time), but she's just so narcissistic and stubborn, she never (or rarely) speaks without thinking first, that you can't help but put aside her best sides and focus on the tooth-cringing ones. Sometimes, she really lacks tact, not to mention good manners, and, for the most part, she walks around feeling like she invented the concept of being a badass. I’ve got news for you, Cece. You still have a lot of road ahead.So flipping frustrating.Sure, she had her good moments, I actually appreciated her spirit and braveness in many occasions, but they were rare and ephemeral enough that they couldn’t have overcome the flaws even if Batman himself joined the collab.I really hope she’ll redeem herself, or at least, grow some sense into that little superiority complex-affected brain of hers.To be completely honest, sometimes I even enjoyed this book, but I couldn't help but notice they were chapters or paragraphs in which Celeana was silent or absent or too busy fighting for her freedom to care about other stuff.Ahem, I'll leave the math to you, peeps.Bless the multi-pov option! I really didn’t mind at all those Dorian or Chaol chapters.And, yes, feel free to read this as: I really didn’t mind Dorian nor Chaol.Which brings us to the romance side.Guess what? There was a love triangle! *fakes shock* I know.So. Original. And. Unexpected.Even if Huey, Dewey, and Louie engaged in some sort of inevitable, twisted and confused love triangle, which I’ll never be a fan of, I still couldn’t care enough to let it bother me. Just give me some substance, I don’t care who sucks whose face.Now, at the question, do you ship Celeana with Dorian or Chaol, I'll reply: WHAT EVEN IS SHIPPING ANYMORE.Since, y'know, I think it'd too much to hope Dorian and Chaol will both dump Sardothien, grab a dozen puppies each, and ride their way into the sunset, together.The other characters didn’t really convince me that much (although no one got nearly on my nerves as Miss Main Character did), I felt like there could have been more work behind, just like the whole story didn’t exactly engage me from start to end for the very same reason.You can tell someone didn't really do their best at researching. The setting and the way all characters behave could have been a little more authentic, and, holy crow, theooc-ismwas too much, even for a mediocre book.Still, I think after a good 60%, both the writing and the plot really improve right before my eyes.I’m convinced, maybe, I would have loved this book better if I read it when it first came out.I have too high standards now. really, it's like a curse.I’ve never really followed SJM but I feel like I should give her another chance (brain screaming: I WANT MORE DORIAN AND CHAOL). I’ll try not to let it influence negatively my coming judgment and consider this book an isolated case, and also this series’ chance to prove how sometimes books can upgrade in reverse, and put some more hopes intoCrown of Midnight.Until then, two and a half stars are more than enough.ACTUAL RATINGS 2.5/5{update July 2021: while my opinion on this book hasn't changed at all (Throne of Glass was and still is a let down with insufferable characters and cringey writing) I wanted to make this little update to tell whoever will read this review that I ended up caving and I continued the series, and I'm glad I did, because it really does get better. The plot in particular. SJM stepped up her writing game and I also ended up liking celaena's character development. This to say, don't be surprised if you step upon another of my THG reviews and find it more positive than this one.

I heard it being sold as GRR Martin\'sGame of Throneswritten for the female audience --- well, as a female audience, I am offended. As an avid reader of the fantasy genre, I am saddened that this is marketed as a fantasy-for-females. Thisbeing a YA does not excuse it from being riddled with clichés, painfully obvious foreshadowing, and a ghost of a fantasy worldruthlessly overshadowed by romantic overtones.Fans of fantasy -actualfantasy - I don\'t suppose would much enjoyThrone of Glass, either. And even though the synopsis makes it soundHunger Games-esque, I\'m afraid on that front, you\'d be disappointed, too.I would say, if you enjoyedThe SelectionbyKiera Cass, but long for a lessself-abasingcharacter than America, then I think you might enjoyThrone of Glass.I must warn you:this review will be long, and most of it dedicated to a bit of a character study if anything; and whySarah J Maas failed at her character of an assassin. But let\'s start at the beginning.Celaena Sardothien has spent years in the death camps of Endovier, where she will ultimately spend the rest of her life. Until, that is, crown prince Dorian appoints her to enter in a competition for the title of King\'s Champion, who will be tasked to do the King\'s secret bidding. But when one by one, the competitors turn up dead, Celaena knows that something evil lurks the castle.Instead of the action-packed novel I was lead to believe I\'d be reading, all I got were ... balls and dances, and then some fight scenes are thrown in there just to make sure we don\'tforgetthat this is supposed to be a story of an assassin. No,Sarah J Maas, I hopeyoudon\'t forget what we came here for.When I say thatThrone of Glasslowers the standards of Fantasy, I mean that it doesn\'t seem to know much about its own setting.Royal Households everywhere, at every turn of the century, have a set of rules dictating things such as etiquette; what is proper and what isimproper. And these rules don\'t exist for the sake of it - there arereasonsbehind etiquette: to prevent affronting your peers, for instance. To prevent harmful court gossip. To prevent a crown prince from running around and fathering a thousand bastards before he is even dubbed King, creating more than enough future claimants to the throne.I assume the same applies inThrone of Glass; for instance thereareetiquettes mentioned that deem a prince dancing with only one partner something considerably rude.Soit threw me way out of time and placewhen I found out that Chaol, Captain of the Guards, would enter Celaena\'s chambers at any time of day he wishes - even when she\'s still dressed in her scanty nightgown.Even the Prince does this; visiting her whensoever he pleases. You may call me a prude, you may call me many anti-feminist names, but this is not acceptable. Not because I give two cents on what the court would say about Celaena; not that I give two cents whether or not the prince was copulating with her; butbecause this is simply not done. Especiallynotwithout repercussion, if even in the form of social stigma.Celaena had a maid waiting on her - but it seems that all she was good for was putting her clothes on. It wasChaolwho barged in her room, underdressed as she was, just to wake her up. He is aCaptain of the Guards. This should not even be his task!These small, ridiculousignorance of Royal Household etiquetteanddivision of labourmade it seem as if the whole thing was poorly researched. You may argue that this wasnotfeudal England; that this world was built entirely ofMaas\' imagination, but things such aslogicshould still apply. And when has iteverbeen logical for aCaptain of Guardsto be responsible for waking up guests? When has it ever beenacceptablefor a Prince to come and go, without repercussion, into a common girl\'s chambers?But that is exactly the problem withThrone of Glass.The entire premisewasn\'tlogical.By this I am of course talking about the King\'s competition.""(...) He\'s hosting a competition. He invited twenty-three members of his council to each sponsor a would-be Champion to train in the glass castle and ultimately compete in a duel.""... and this Champion of his is tasked ...To work for the King of Adarlan as his loyal servant. She raised her chin. To kill for him (...)But where is the logic fail?you ask me. Allow me to reiterate. He wants aloyalsubject to kill for him, without question, with the utmost secrecy. Yet he chooses thisloyal subjectthrough acompetition. Not only that, he makes hiscouncilmenchoose the competitors for him.I may not be a direct member of a royal family myself, but I know there are things such as courtintrigueandhidden agendasand hell, there are hundreds upon thousands of discrete allegiances and plots being made left, right and centre.Do youreallywant yourfuture, ""loyal"" Championto be handpicked out of a number ofcriminalsand entrusted to yourcouncilmen?The whole competition thing wasn\'t at all very thought through. In the end, it felt as if it was just there to get the story going, to get Celaena into the castle.The competition itself was a let downnstead of some fight-to-the-death (or similar) trope, we get ... a race. An archery competition. Wall-climbing. And a lot of others that happened off screen.Amidst all these competitions and training programs, the plot scattered into flirting banter, gatecrashing parties, and some girl-on-girl hating; as ifthe author wasn\'t quite sure whether she wanted her novel to be the story of a ruthless assassin, or the romances of a ruthless assassin princess-wannabe.And now I get to Celaena, the princess-wannabe. Allow me to present a number of quotes I\'ve highlighted:She loved clothes--loved the feeling of silk, of velvet, of satin, of suede and chiffon--and was fascinated by the grace of seams, the intricate perfection of an embossed surface. And when she won this ridiculous competition, when she was free ... she could buy all the clothes she wanted.*Everything was wet and half-frozen, and while she could bear sodden hair, she couldn\'t withstand the agony of wet shoes.*There were more Champions seated at the tables--even the pimply-faced Pelor sat near Chaol! A half-rate boy assassin! She bared her teeth. How dare she be denied an invitation to the feast?You read all that and tell me, do you imagine these thoughts coming from a renown, world-classassassin?An assasin complaining about her wet shoes?About not being invitedto a banquet?No. Two things strike me here: First,she had just spent years at adeath camp, but her behaviour upon leaving it did not portray any humility or gratefulness of being far away from all those whippings and forced labour. You\'d think she\'d just be glad to be away from the mines and pickaxe to becomplaining about wet shoesSMH.Second;this sounds more like something a ditzy princess-wannabe would say. Oh, after I win this competition,I\'m gonna buy myself some clothes. For someone who has spent years suffering, who spent her childhood being trained as a ruthless killer, she comes across sounding soprivileged.Now, I\'m not an assassin. I\'ve never beentrainedas one, but for years Ididgo through a whole series of martial arts before finding one that suited my small stature. And ofallmartial arts -- from karate to jiu-jitsu to wushu to the one I finally settled with -- there wasone thingwe were taught was the foundation of any great martial artist.Discipline.And I\'m sorry, Celaena. Butyou don\'t have it.This is her reaction tofailing at a game of pool:A shriek of rage ripped from her throat, and Celaena ran over to the pocket. She first screamed at the ball, then took the cue in her hands and bit down upon the shaft, still screaming through her clamped teeth. Finally the assassin stopped and slapped the three ball into the pocket.This is her discipline at training:""It\'s cold,"" she moaned, holding her knees to her body. She didn\'t care that she had only a few months to beat the other Champions--she needed sleep.""I\'m afraid it doesn\'t work that way; you don\'t get to tell me that this girl is an accomplished, feared assassin at the age of.... sixteen?.... buther entire mentality, her entirepersonalitydoes not ring true of an assassin.Do you think the realm\'s greatest killer would be afraid ofwalking in a glass house?""Only an idiot would walk in a house made of glass.""(...)The thought of standing on floors of glass made her queasy.....afraid ofheights?She had a terrible headache around her left temple. Everything was sickly and frail. They were so high up, so dangerously high ...Do you think they moan and whinge and complain at the drop of a hat?Once they\'d finished their run, they trained in a private room far from her competitor\'s eyes. Until, that is, she collapsed to the ground and cried that she was about to die of hunger and fatigue.*Celaena frowned at herself as she hurried after the captain into the foyer. ""I look ridiculous! These pants are absurd, and this shirt is awful.""For heaven\'s sake, you\'re an assassin, not a supermodel. No. Discipline doesn\'t just mean getting up every morning and training every day. It also means adiscipline of the mind. It means self-restraint. It means keeping your head low. What kind of assassinwantsto be the centre of attention?? To have her skills known?? If you want glory, then you\'re in the wrong career path. Be a damned knight.But Celaena isvainandself-absorbed. Shewants to be in the spotlight.""I hate all these guards and nonsense; I hate you telling me to hold back when Brullo sings Cain\'s praises and I\'m just there, boring and unnoticed in the middle.""*""Do you know how insulting it is to pretend to be some nobody thief from a small city in Fenharrow?""Not only that, but she\'s also very contradictory and hypocritical:What was a ""Champion"" but a dressed-up name for murderer? Could she actually stomach working for him?And I suppose ""assassin"" is just a synonym for mercy-killer? But enough of her faults.Let\'s take a look at her more positive attributes.She\'s beautiful. In factsobeautiful that she drains the blood out of peoplewho sees her:Celaena smiled smugly to herself as she nodded to a passing noble-man, who raised his eyebrows at the sight of her. He was immensely pale, she noticed as he opened his mouth to say something, but Celaena continued down the hall.In factsobeautiful that other ladies envy her and she has to shove that in their facesbecause you can\'t have a YA novel without other girls being envious of our heroine!:She smiled at the young chevaliers as they passed--and smirked at the court women who eyed her pink-and-white gown. She couldn\'t blame them; the dress was spectacular. And she was spectacular in it. Even Redd, one of the handsomer guards posted outside her rooms, had said so.Also shallow, as it seems, because if Reddhadn\'tbeen handsome, his opinion wouldn\'t have mattered, right?Still not convinced that she\'s shallow?Why did Chaol never joke with her as Dorian did? Perhaps he truly didn\'t find her attractive. The possibility of it stung more than she would have liked.You see,because people can only like you if you\'reattractive. Oh, sorry, I got sidetracked. We were talking over herpositiveattributes. Well, she\'s a great dancer:She didn\'t falter a single step, nor did she seem to care about the many angry female faces that watched as dance after dance passed and they didn\'t switch partners.She also plays ameanpianobecause music is like, the way we show just how deep and artistic our heroine is:Celaena eyed the pianoforte. She used to play--oh, she\'d loved to play, loved music(...)Shelovesdogsbecause that\'s how we know she\'s a kind-hearted person. No evil person is an animal lover!:""Of course I want her,"" Celaena said, then realized what the implications would be. ""But I want her trained. I don\'t want her urinating on everything and chewing on furniture and shows and books. And I want her to sit when I tell her to and lay down and roll over (...)Oh, but she doesn\'t want to beinconveniencedso she doesn\'t want totrain it herselfof course! She speaks foreign languages,and!just so we canallrelate to her-- she also loves books!I could go on andpoint out her inconsistencies, but this is getting much too long for my liking. In short,Celaena Sardothien is a Mary Sue. But even worse --she is anunlikeable, vain, shallow, self-centred Mary Sue. And if you expect me to believe she\'s a deadly killer, then you better think again.But that is the final problem I had with this book -- the narratorconstantlytells us what to believe.There was something great and deadly concealed within her, and he didn\'t like it.while moments later, she\'s rolling on the ground, crying and whinging that she\'s gonna die of starvation. Yeah, no.Also,""Because it looks like he\'s in love with her,"" he said, and walked away.(...) His shoulders were straight, his back erect. He looked like a man. Like a king.Yeah, if you say so.But,you say to me,there must besomethingyou liked?Well, Ididlike Celaena\'s relationship with the err, Indian princess. I forgot her name. Because I didn\'t like the actual princess herself -- she doesn\'t know tact. She doesn\'t know diplomacy. She comes to a foreign realm and all she does is whinge and insult their language and clothes and court.So, no. I didn\'t like the plot, I didn\'t like the characters. The only stars go to Chaol for being a beacon of sanity amidst all the awfulness. It\'s a pity he, too, fell for our Mary Sue.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '""I swear on my crown that the pup shall live.""The five Throne of Glass novellas did a great job convincing me to push toward the main series. I mean what\'s not to like: A mysterious new world, a set of interesting characters (in novellas) and a lot of potential plot-lines to explore. But, after reading this first book, the only reason I\'m rounding up what felt like a 2.5-star read to 3-star (instead of 2) is, me not belonging in the intended audience. But even for a young audience, I believe some of the stuff here are too shallow and rudimentary, especially in the first half of the book.Though it wasn\'t much original, I still found the plot to be interesting. The unfairly convicted protagonist trying to make a change by fighting on multiple fronts, and some politics to keep things heated among characters, while adding a bit of dark magic to have a little mysteriousness. Story starts with Celaena being conditionally released from prison, to participate in a competition which expects to select a champion for the king. I was under the impression that this competition would be the main plotline, but it was mostly on sidelines. Politics played a major part, and I think that\'s what I enjoyed the most here. As for magic, there wasn\'t a whole lot of revelations in this one, however I\'m hoping everything would become clear in time. But after a few chapters, it quickly becomes apparent that the main theme here is romance. Everything revolves around Dorian - Celaena - Chaol trio, and leading up to a too obvious love triangle. But at least, it\'s not one of those terrible ones, where one of the three being a complete villain. The pace of the story was also okay, and even though the book wasn\'t much impactful, it was kind of a fun read overall. But the prose has a lot of room to improve, especially by moving beyond the pure melodramatic conversation.However, I have to admit, it did get better towards the end. Even though the villain turned out to be the obvious one, I loved the detailed final battle, until the very end.From the very first page, I didn\'t expect much from Celaena. It was clear from the novellas, aside from being fun, she had a number of conflicting traits, and was not very congruous with being an infamous assassin. Trying to squeeze in this many qualities to a single character is hardly a good idea, even if the character is of an age suit to be full of wisdom, and experience. But when you try that with an eighteen year old girl, who is the definition of impulsiveness, it is not surprising that the character turning out to be an annoyance. Even if the author had intended to create a strong role model for readers of the intended audience, I think the character came out looking too shallow, and inconsistent. I\'m not giving examples to avoid spoilers, but one does not have to look deep to find her shortcomings. Celaena might be a very popular character but she is anything but a role-model in my opinion.If it wasn\'t for the novellas, I probably would not have finished this book. And even with the novellas, I still might\'ve discontinued, if it wasn\'t for the shared opinion among many that first couple of books being the weakest in the series. I hope, at least in time, these qualities would fade away. At this point, I cannot say that I liked the prose that much either, but I\'m hoping that\'d improve as well.""So, I highly suggest, Miss Sardothien, that you get your arrogance in check.""'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'This book was sooooo goood!

She was taken from Endovier (the death camp) and brought to the castle to fight with other Champions. If she wins then she has to kill for the King for 4 years and then she is free. I have a feeling that\'s not to be. Prince Dorian is the one that chose her as his champion to fight against the others.

Maas! This is a very popular series. An extremely popular series, an exceptionally hyped up series, a tremendouslyOLD AF SERIES. Listen to me here, if I were a fantasy fan when I was a teenager, I would have definitely read this book. But you know, my relationship with fantasy hasn\'t been lit for the last2583 years, so I hadn\'t picked it up. I started loving fantasy again this year because ofA Court of Thorns and Roses, a book I bought because I needed it for my uni thesis, not because I was interested in reading fantasy again.SO YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH WORK I GOT WITH FANTASY BOOKS. I haven\'t read fantasy since 2010. I have a million fantasy series to catch up to. I\'m nervous.I WANT TO READ ALL THE FANTASY NOW AND NOTHING BUT FANTASY.ANYWAY, LET\'S TALK ABOUT THIS BOOK.After serving out a year of hard labor in the salt mines of Endovier for her crimes, 18-year-old assassin Celaena Sardothien is dragged before the Crown Prince. Prince Dorian offers her her freedom on one condition: she must act as his champion in a competition to find a new royal assassin.Her opponents are men-thieves and assassins and warriors from across the empire, each sponsored by a member of the king\'s council. If she beats her opponents in a series of eliminations, she\'ll serve the kingdom for four years and then be granted her freedom. Celaena finds her training sessions with the captain of the guard, Westfall, challenging and exhilarating. But she\'s bored stiff by court life. Things get a little more interesting when the prince starts to show interest in her ... but it\'s the gruff Captain Westfall who seems to understand her best.Then one of the other contestants turns up dead ... quickly followed by another. Can Celaena figure out who the killer is before she becomes a victim? As the young assassin investigates, her search leads her to discover a greater destiny than she could possibly have imagined.I had very high expectations for this book which were partially met. As I said before, my firstSarah J. Maasbook isA Court of Thorns and Roses, which is the her latest series. Most of you have readThrone of Glassfirst and thenA Court of Thorns and Roses, and you have experienced her writing flourish. I haven\'t. I read her better book first. I can see now that she has improved so much, her writing is so much better now. Some things in the writing of this book weren\'t my thing, like repetitions of some phrases, ""assassin"" being referred to Celaena the whole entire time (which bugged me a bit), poor choice of words at some parts. But I recognized Sarah in this book. I can recognize her writing style now, and I truly love it.This book gave me suchGame of ThronesandHarry Potter and the Goblet of Firevibes! From the badass main character with the hard to pronounce name which reminded me ofDaenerys Targaryento the championship which was like theTriwizard TournamentinGoblet of Fire, the vibes were fucking lit yo! The worldSarah J. Maashas created in this book was so immersive, I was so into it when I was reading the book. I wasn\'t even confused with all the names and places and words, it all came natural to me. I can see how after this book, the world will expand to an enormous extend with magic and Fae and so many new characters appearing, and I\'m here for it!The multiple character perspectives was a surprise to me. Celaena owns the most chapters, but we can see things told from mostly all the characters, (even the fucking King) which is something I was surprised about as it does not happen in her other series. I loved it. This is what I missed from theA Court of Thorns and Rosesseries. The multiple character POVs. And I relish in the fact that we can explore things from numerous viewpoints.CELAENA GUYS. CELAENA SARDOTHIEN. I LOVE YOU TO THE MOON AND BACK. I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY AND FIND THE BEST MATCH FOR YOU AND UNDERSTAND YOUR PAST AND YOUR LINEAGE AND BASICALLY CONTINUE TO BE A BADASS QUEEN. I didn\'t expect her character to be like this, to be honest. The book description suggested a ruthless, cold-hearted killer, and I expected as much. But her compassion and her kindness and her passion for multiple things showed from the very first pages. She is a merciless assassin who can end you with a snap of her finger but she has also kept her personality. Her humor, her quirkiness. She loves beautiful dresses, she loves to eat good food, puppies 🐶, and she loves books.SHE IS A READER GUYS. I absolutelyADOREwhen book characters are readers. Especially in fantasy. I can relate to them so much easier.I immensely appreciated her friendship with Nehemia and that it wasn\'t ruined at the end. I was so scared about this. I loathe when they make female characters hate each other in books, especially about a love interest! Just don\'t, please.Girls need to stick together!I want to see more of her in the future books. I\'m sure we will, but it was left kind of wonky in this book. I suspected her too, in the middle of the book, and I was certain it was her, orchestrating everything. But it was Cain. The obvious choice. It was anticlimactic, to be totally honest. I wanted it to be someone else. We all expected Cain, and it was Cain. I didn\'t believe it would be him, I was certain there would be a plot twist, at the end, or something. But no.AND NOWWWWWWthe romance. I love both Dorian and Chaol, both for different reasons. I\'m so fond of the relationships Celaena holds with both of them. They\'re so different, and yet they both mean so much to her.I SHIPPED BOTH THOSE SHIPS THROUGHOUT THIS BOOK.But I lean like 51% on Dorian. Their scenes were cuter, and I think they have more things in common. Their passion for books, the billiard scenes, the music scene,THE FUCKING PUPPY, the dance, the kisses, the candy. They made me feels so many things! And then we have scenes with Chaol and I was back in that train again.COME ON CELAENA, DARLING, JUST CHOOSE. I will choose for you, but for myself. I have no problem with that, sweetie 😉 I was conflicted about her train of thought, to be frank. The one moment she found Dorian extremely attractive and she wanted to kiss him, and the next she found Chaol handsome and she wanted to spend more and more time with him. I was as much confused as she is. But I\'m delighted that the author didn\'t make the romance the main part of the book. She didn\'t portray Celaena as a character who depends on a man to save her, or to make her feels special or anything alike. She would have been fine without them as love interests in her life. Furthermore, I have to talk about Nox. What a sweetheart. What a wasted opportunity on a character. We basically saw nothing of him. I thought he was gonna be a third love interest in the beginning and I was like""WOAH WOAH THERE SARAH HON SLOW DOWN""but luckily he wasn\'t. But I kept thinking about his character.YOU\'RE THE TRUE AND UNDOUBTFUL EPITOME OF THE WORD ""FRIENDZONE"". I hope we see him again.The final battle... oh man. It dragged more than it should, to be honest, but it was breathtaking. Sarah knows how to write a good jaw-dropping ending. There was so much information throughout this whole battle, that I had to reread some parts to totally grasp what was going on. It was so intense and magical and out of this world. I was so proud of myGIRLfor still being strong and trying to fight even though she was drugged. She made me believe, at some parts, that she would win. Kaltain. UGH. May we never see this bitch again. I WAS SO HAPPY WHEN WE FOUND OUT THE DUKE WAS SCHEMING BEHIND HER BACK ALL ALONG. I know we will see her again, but fuck her. I don\'t want to see her lying ass point of view again.To sum it all up, this was a pretty strong beginning to a series. I only gave it4 starsbecause it didn\'t overwhelm me. I keep comparing it to A Court of Thorns and Roses, which is like my favorite series, at the moment. I can\'t stop comparing these two series, damn it. But I loved it nonetheless and I\'m waiting for the next book,Crown of Midnight, to arrive. I\'m actually pretty excited, cause I have heard these books get so much better. and I can already see that. So till the next one... K BYE!!'}]"

It's book one in the Twisted series but can be read as a standalone.","[{'rating': 3, 'content': '2.75 stars✩⋆when i saw that this book has groveling, best friend\'s brother, grumpy/sunshine trope,touch her and i\'ll kill you,i hate everyone but you, a bed-sharing scene, great friend group, and revenge plan (???), i ran so fast and downloaded this real quick. plus, this was being hyped in booktok so might as well read it.i don\'t know why but this book just made me evaluate my life-myself. why do you ask? well,WARNING FOR NON ROMANCE READERS THIS ⤵ QUOTE IS SPICY OK BYE:""And your pussy is mine. Every inch of you belongs to me, and if you ever let another man touch you- he\'ll end up in pieces, and you\'ll end up tied to my bed and fucked in every hole until my name is the only one you remember. Do you understand?""and at first i was likebecause there\'s things you need to know about me when it comes to my taste for irl men:1.i hate bossy men (pls- i\'m bossy enough as it is)2.toxic? i rebuke this negative energy.3.if you threaten to kill someone if they so much as touch me, therapy or 911?4.if you call me questionable nicknames while having sex, BYE ✋and normally, my attitude iswhy do menbut when i read this? i don\'t know myself anymore.i don\'t know what came over me but suddenly i... i um.. that quote above... i LiKe it... so if you know me, no you don\'t.but anyways, going back to the book, i like bothAva(h) andAlex(H) as individual characters. Alex is literally THE definition of a ""fictional character"" because that man is too perfect. basically, he has an IQ of 160, created a software thingy that made him a multimillionaire in high school and became the COO of a real estate agent development or something and has Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory aaand knows Krav Maga AAAND apparently fucks like a porn star? i-that\'s too much perfection ma\'am.i thought Ava and her friend group were also fucking perfect because✧Bridgetis a literal princess (i\'m not joking)✧Julesis jessica rabbit (??) apparently (also, fingers cross for a Jules and Josh book)✧Stellais this influencer who has 400k followers (???)can i be a part of this fictional friend group pls and thx.i thought the romance was cute in the beginning. usually, in a brother\'s best friend book the girl isalwayspining for the guy while the guy plays a martyr act and becomes a ho to ""push"" the girl away even though he has feelings for her. i\'m glad that\'s not the case here and love the fact that Ava was even a little indifferent towards him at first. and honestly? the smut scenes were kinda hot.overall,this is a very chill book. at least for me. though there are sometw (spoilers) // parental deaths, violence, and child abuse-`,✎WHY NOT A HIGHER RATING?➳since uh, when?i really did think the romance and the wholeOperation Emotionthing in the beginning was cute, though, their feelings for one another went from 0 to 100 very fast because Alex really went from not caring that Ava was having a nightmare and acting all cold and ""heartless"" to:""She was mine. She just didn\'t know it yet. I hadn\'t known it myself until I saw her in Colton\'s arms and every instinct raged at me to tear her away. To claim what belonged to me.""i only sensed attraction but i didn\'t get the feeling they were already at the ""she\'s mine, he\'s mine"" stage. one chapter he\'s acting all nonchalant and cold and then in the next he “desires” her and tells us how badly he wants her and i was like bish when? most of the things he talked about in his pov was about his revenge and a little bit of attraction and with ava\'s pov it was all the operation emotion so them having intense feelings for one another felt kinda quick.their banter was cute the scenes were cute but personally it wasn’t enough for me to be convinced with his new macho man personality towards her. there wasn’t enough depth to be honest. like i didnt get the vibes he cared enough for her to call her “his” because even when he saw her having night terrors in the beginning, i got the vibes he didnt care for her that much and still acted like she was a nuisance.➳telling >>> showingwhen they got together after the first time they had sex there was a lot of telling >>> showing of how they are as a couple and that really bugs me because i\'m the type of person who wants to knoweverything. apparently, they went on dates, alex was suddenly making jokes (?), and they talk through the night but because of the 0 to 100 energy and telling >>> showing, I. STILL. DONT. SEE. THEM. DOING. ALL. THAT. like- what do they even talk about?? and because of this, i wasn\'t really convinced with their “love”, i just didnt feel it becausei wantedallthe details of how they are as a couple and we didn\'t really get that. once they have sex, most of the romance were written in the inner monologue and it\'s mainly because the last half focused more on the revenge plot. also, even the the grovelling was telling >>> showing. noo, i need more.➳Viciousreincarnatedno, but everyone is right tho- i can definitely see the Vicious in Alex. he likes fucking classy women, has insomnia, and has a revenge plan that includes the heroine. i see no difference.➳OW dramadon\'t worry, it\'s nothing bad but i just find it icky when Alex says that the OW fucks like a porn star or when he was about to go on a ""date"" with the OW (don\'t worry, Ava ruined his plans) or when the OW says this to Ava\'s face:""Alex doesn’t do either of those things. It’s well known amongst a certain segment of D.C.’s female population. No kissing, no face-to-face contact during sex. But he will take you from behind. Choke and fuck you till you see stars. Call you the filthiest names and treat you like a slut.""and then Ava thinks this is hot. personally, if someone says this to my face about the guy i\'m into, i will dip because that\'s an ick for me (please blame my virgo sun and my high standards). you\'re telling me you\'re gonna fuck your girl the same way you\'ve fucked your past hookups? ew no thx.-`,✎OVERALL THOUGHTSagain, i thought the romance was cute but it was just ok. the first half was full of cute moments but the last half kinda went down with all the telling >>> showing and i was kinda disappointed with the groveling because of this. like- you\'re just gonna describe how Alex has grovelled for a YEAR in just a page? no ma\'am i want to seeeverything. also, i wanted more scenes of them of how they are as a couple because i just don\'t see Alex being all soft towards Ava.i\'m excited for the next book, aka Bridget\'s book tho! i love the whole princess/bodyguard, forbidden trope. plus, her future mans name isRHYS. that name will forever be sacred so this fictional man who has the privilege of being named after that sacred name better live up to my high af standards.»»━━Twisted series━━««#1: twisted love— ava x alex ➳2.75 stars#2:twisted games— bridget x rhys ➳tbr#3:twisted hate— jules x josh ➳tbr#4:twisted lies— stella x christian ➳tbr'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'OH BOYYYYYYY! LET\'S GOOOOOOOOLet me hype myself up before I write this one.Another absurdly overhyped book. Everyone tells me this series is good and the later books are better. I don\'t doubt it. I don\'t think Ana is a bad writer, her writing is tolerable and sometimes even enjoyable.Can\'t say the same thing for her characters.NOTHINGin this book or even it\'s cover are congruent. Ana thought it would be fun to attemptevery single trope in the history of the universewith a single story, so you can\'t really tell if this is a romcom, a dark romance or just a joke.You get brother\'s best friend, neighbor, nightmare tropes, who did this to you, my parents died or tried to kill me, ex psycho boyfriend, billionaire CEO who doesn\'t date, grumpy-sunshine, family members who want to steal your money and not a single one of these were executed properly. I honestly felt like I was watching a Spanish telenovela.However, I HAVE TO MENTION thebesttrope of all. The one that brought tears to my eyes. The""I AM NOT LIKE OTHER GUYS!!!!!""but I will talk exactly like Christian Grey every time I get the chance. (so he kind is like one guy)Alex, our main character. CEO, billionaire, with an IQ of 190, hates beer, he is not scared of anything, not even bears. Won\'t kiss during sex, because he hates intimacy. He hates birthdays because everyone has one. He thinks everyone wants him for his magnificent shlong. He has been controlling his family\'s company since he was 14, because he was always knew he would be CEO one day and his uncle would listen to his 14 YEAR OLD DEMANDS. He also slut shames his own friends.IT IS LIKE I AM READING THE WORST TINDER BIO EVER WRITTEN.But yet quite possible to exist out there somewhere, the bio under some guy named Rey who lives in Florida and is a republican who hates women.He also says people feared him at 11, because his parents were killed and he swore revenge. It\'s like a wish version of Batman.Except Batman is actually cool.He apparently had a therapist after his parents died. Someone PLEASE GO TAKE THAT GUY\'S license, because it obviously didn\'t work.Alex, and I quote:""Is not a TOY, so don\'t play with him unless you want to get hurt"" WHAT KIND OF FUCKING TOYS WERE YOU PLAYING WITH WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD YOU PSYCOPATH.But yeah, Alex\'s broken record was to please: ""stop trying to humanize me, I am your bad guy."" He also guarantees people that""biological reactions can be mastered""Good fucking luck next time you have to sneeze BRO. Hope you don\'t fucking explodeOur female main character was the SUNSHINE OF THE PARTY! The most giggly adorable girl who apparently ""fucks like a porn star"" (this author had a really really really weird obsession with porn stars since she mentioned them not once, but four times during her entire book)Our FMC had her own mother try to drown her, then proceeded to kill herself from guilt. Her ex cheated on her multiple times, abused her physically BUT SHE IS SUUUUUUUUUCH A SUNSHINE and all she needs is to get dicked down to still see the good in people. Fuck therapy.It\'s so hilarious that in the desperate need to make this book a tiktok sensation... she added so many things that absolutely don\'t go together for the sake of hype, but guess what? Tiktok is that predictable.She succeeded.Now, moving on to the sex scenes. Probably the most hilarious thing I have ever read in my life. Christian Grey comparison aside, we get the most AMAZING LINES I HAVE EVER READ in my book blogger career.""I am turning you into my fuck doll""(?????????????? I mean if you want herunresponsive... I have something to tell ya...We might need to call you a new therapist, or maybe get you into jail.I haven\'t decided yet.)He literally describes the view of her on his bed as a:""sacrificial virgin waiting defilement""Every time she puts her hand on his dick, she""can feel the power it emanates"".I mean, by all means, put a cape on it and give it a marvel contract.Well, anyways... a bunch of stupid things happen, this book is MASSIVELY long for some UNKNOWN reason, just like Alex\'s penis. Near the end, our HEROOOOO threatens the mean girl to destroy HER company, because he has that sort of power, if she doesn\'t tell him where his girlfriend is. It has the same energy as:""my daddy is a lawyer""in third grade.It pains me to say this entire review constitutes of quotes from this book, because honestly? It\'s all I needed. It\'s embarrassing enough on it\'s own. I hardly did any work here.Maybe I will read the next one since you guys love it so much, let\'s see.Anyways, my stomach hurts from laughing.*wipes sweat off brows*'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'the red in the flag that is alex volkov is from all my brain cells he has murdered, and the blood of the people he has actually murdered 😍everybody who said he begged and grovelled for a year LIED, i hope you guys have to wear wet socks for the rest of ur lives 🤠 he spends half a year preparing to stalk ava, and then does that for the next half. no tears were shed on his end, i demand my money back.i wanted to be nice to this book just because of howunintentionally hilarious and satiricalit was, but then hesangand all of that was out the window.i respectfully don\'t care enough about the plot to go into details about it, but if you must know, it was very poorly executed and i did not care one bit for anything that was going on.i do want to elaborate on the absolute JOY that alex and ava are though 🥰 apparently miss huang agrees bec they\'re her favorites.meet,Alex(H): he has a god complex you can\'t rival, a dick for days, a massive ego, works as a full-time stalker for six months, will get jealous of a fly if it dares to hover around ava for more than a second, thinks he\'s the most special mf on god\'s green earth, isn\'t scared of anything not even wild animals, has HSAM (Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory) that he uses to relive a traumatic event of his past bec he\'s weird like that, is a walmart version of Christian Grey, and he\'s so freaking smart that he quadrupled his investments and also became a millionaire in high school because of a technology he invented 🥺💅🏻 doesn\'t he sound like an absolute bombastic slay?let me tell you he\'s acc not. alex isa man written by a woman who has probably never had any interaction w a man beforehe\'s so cringey you won\'t believe it - but I\'ll let him speak for himself 😵\u200d💫╰─▸ ❝Nothing turned me off more than desperation, which reeked stronger than their perfume.❞says the guy that left his job and followed ava around for six months like a pathetic loser 🙏🏻╰─▸ ❝Besides, everyone knew I was the power behind the throne, anyway.❞power, throne, kingdom - shut ur fucking mouth fr 🤡╰─▸ ❝It was the same thing that would’ve gone through any red-blooded male’s mind.

On one hand, I really liked this book but on the other, I really didn’t. I will try to be as thorough as I possibly can in this review so let’s get on with it...🔹What I liked:✏Characters:〰 Here’s the thing, I liked the characters, I really did. Both Ava and Alex were loveable and the side characters were also interesting and intriguing. I even liked Bridget and wasn’t bothered by the fact that she was aliteralprincess (which, granted, is utterly unbelievable but I still found that aspect to be amusing despite its utter incredulity).✏Tropes:〰 The writing style was good and the book literally had all the tropes that I usually adore (brother’s best friend, grumpy/sunshine pairing...) and they were actually well done.〰 I really liked the fact that Ava’s brother did not forgive Alex at the end. Honestly, I thought that was very realistic considering Alex’s betrayal of their friendship and the way he manipulated both Josh and Ava. I also found that aspect quite refresh since it leaves their friendship open for further development later on in the series (in Josh and Jules’ book).✏Representation:〰 We have a beautiful Asian heroine and a hero of Ukrainian descent, which we just love to see. I also really appreciated all the small details that the author included to help us learn more about the Chinese culture; that aspect was honestly well done and seamlessly integrated in the story.〰 The first half of the book was really entertaining and I was sure that this would become a very fun and quick read for me. The second half however is where things started to go south in my opinion and this is why...🔹What I did not like:✏Plot:〰 During the second half of the book I started getting the feeling that I was watching a bad soap opera. Things started becoming incredibly unbelievable and cheesy. For instance, the whole thing with Ava’s father was such a cliché that I was honestly surprised that none of the author’s beta readers had told her to cut out this “plot twist”. The writing in these instances also needed rework since they reinforced the feeling that I was watching a Disney villain giving his speech and congratulating himself on his wickedness. This is an example of what I mean:“Michael’s face remained anguished for several more seconds before it twisted and morphed into a hideous mask. His eyes gleamed with delighted malice, and his mouth spread into a mocking smile. [...] ‘Bravo’. He slow-clapped. ‘I almost had you,’ he told me. ‘You should’ve seen yourself’I swear, Mrs. James was real,’he mimicked, laughing.”〰 And don’t even get me started on how Micheal was the man who supposedly killed his parents only to find out that Alex’s uncle was actually behind the whole thing. I would genuinely be shocked if anyonewasshocked by this “turn of events”.✏Aspects of the writing style and characterization:〰 And this is what I personally think was my biggest issue with this book. The novel does an awful lot of ‘telling’ instead of ‘showing’. Both characters go from not knowing each other to being madly in love in a short amount of time. And the thing is? They’ve supposedly been seeing each other and getting to know each other for months by that point. But we as readers are only told of this passage of time instead of shown the moments that they spent together. This is not something that can work in a romance novel. We need to see the main characters slowly opening up to each other and starting to like each other in order for us to believe in their romance. This is why some romances that are set within the span of a single week work. Because its not about how many months the main characters have known each other, it’s about how valuable and detailed each interaction between the two is.〰 This happened once again when it came to the groveling aspect. A literalyearpasses in which the hero is supposedly groveling and begging the heroine to take him back. However, readers are once again not shown any part of said groveling. This is what I mean:“Alex and I had developed a new... well, I wasn’t sure if I could call it a friendship, but it was a step up from whatever we had when he arrived in London a year ago.”〰 Ummm, I’m sorry what? You can’t go from having the heroine say that she will never forgive the hero to having her say something like ‘Alex and I developed a friendship over the past year’. If you do that then you can’t expect your readers to believe in the legitimacy of said friendship because guess what (and I cannot stress this enough):👏Passage of time alone does not a convincing relationship make.👏We need to see the development between the characters in order to root for them because frankly? By that point I neither believed in Ava and Alex’s love nor did I believe in Alex’s remorse because I hadn’t been able to see him truly grovel. That said, I honestly hope that this aspect of the novel gets better in the second installment.🔹Final thoughts:〰 If you read any of my ‘pre-reading’ updates then you know that I had incredibly high expectations for this book. I had never read any of this author’s works before but this novel contained all of the tropes that I usually adore. The snippets that I saw on the author’s instagram page also reinforced my belief that this was definitely a book that I would enjoy. Hell, when I first added this on Goodreads it literally only had about 20 or 25 other people who had also added it (so I truly found it very early on). That said, while I wouldn’t necessarily say that I was disappointed or let down by the execution in this book (because, as I previously mentioned, I enjoyed many aspects of it), I will still say that I think many things needed rework and further editing.〰 Finally, I do think that I might read the sequel since I truly enjoyed the friendship group in here and I do think that this author has a lot of potential. So do I recommend this book? I think this could be the perfect example of a guilty pleasure read in my opinion. Many things needed to be done differently but this wasn’t a horrible read in any way.———————Instagram:https://www.instagram.com/rose_books2/—————————————————————————-PRE-READING UPDATES:———————-Ok but I just stalked the author’s instagram and now I’m pretty freaking excited about this😩———————-Mmmm I think I’m intriguedFr tho, gotta love the grumpy/sunshine trope loll.'}]"

It was all anyone could talk about. And five years later, Pip sees how the tragedy still haunts her town.But she can't shake the feeling that there was more to what happened that day. She knew Sal when she was a child, and he was always so kind to her. How could he possibly have been a killer?Now a senior herself, Pip decides to reexamine the closed case for her final project, at first just to cast doubt on the original investigation. But soon she discovers a trail of dark secrets that might actually prove Sal innocent . . . and the line between past and present begins to blur. Someone in Fairview doesn't want Pip digging around for answers, and now her own life might be in danger.","[{'rating': 5, 'content': 'Yesss! The BBC series adaptation is announced to be released on Netflix on August 1st! It’s a date! Cannot wait!Applause! Applause! Applause! This book offered one of the quickest and most exhilarating roller coaster experiences the moment I laid my hands on it. I’m still shaky, incoherent (I’ve even requested a translator to articulate my thoughts properly), my nails have seen better days, and I’m both confused and dizzy. But I’m also smiling and filled with happiness! I wholeheartedly give it a perfect five out of five mysterious shining stars!The storytelling is exceptional, the plot keeps you hooked, the character development is fantastic, the pacing is fast and heart-pounding, and the ending is immensely satisfying. What are you waiting for, folks? This book won’t just fall from the sky into your lap. Go ahead, buy it, and send me thank-you letters for my encouraging words!We have an incredible heroine in Pippa (don’t mistake her for Pippi Longstocking). Fitz-Amobi is a talented, smart, nerdy, funny, social, friendly, brave investigator who stands somewhere between Nancy Drew and Veronica Mars, a slightly older version of Harriet Walsh, possessing technical skills but without tattoos, leather, or chains, a more restrained version of Lisbeth Salander, and a younger version of Dana Scully without Mulder and alien conspiracies!The blurb is tempting, intriguing, and immediately pulls you in, making it hard to let go of the book, as I found out. My dogs are even jealous of the book, barking at the moon in protest, but I couldn’t put it down, as it’s one of those books that grabs you from the very first page.Five years ago, Andie Bell went missing, and Sal Singh, who committed suicide after confessing to her murder in a text message, was presumed responsible. Yet Andie’s body was never found. The case was closed, but Pippa is determined to reopen it for her school project. She starts by interviewing Sal’s 20-year-old brother, Ravi, who naturally becomes her partner in crime. Their project evolves into a mission to prove Sal’s innocence and find out who might have really killed Andie.As they dig deeper, Pippa’s list of people of interest grows longer, even including her best friend’s sister.There are numerous burning questions in your mind: Who truly killed Andie? Is Andie really dead? Did she deserve her fate? Because as we learn more about her, we discover she was a bully, a drama queen, a drug dealer, and a blackmailer. Her less-than-stellar attributes made me want to give her a piece of my mind. It’s strange because I’ve never felt the urge to confront a presumed dead person—or someone I’m not even sure is deceased! But this character is a living, breathing (or not) scoundrel!Who framed Sal? Did Sal actually do it? His portrayal as a nice, humble, angelic guy led me to nickname him Castiel, like the angel from ‘Supernatural.’ But we can sense he’s been hiding something. His friends changed their testimonies regarding his whereabouts and the time he left their gathering, refusing to be his alibis. So where was he at the time of the murder?Who was sending threatening messages to Pippa, trying to stop her investigation?I devoured this book, and my detective skills failed me completely until the final pages. The author always stayed ten steps ahead of me! I feel blessed to be outsmarted by her brilliant writing. I can already picture this as an amazing YA mystery movie or a limited Netflix series (anything to replace the third season of ‘13 Reasons Why,’ which might as well be titled ‘13 Reasons Why Did You Even Make a Third Season?’).It was an emotional, enjoyable, nail-biting, mind-bending, thrilling, and ultimately satisfying read. I savored every page, every clue, and every heart-pounding moment of this book. I highly recommend it! It’s even better than ‘One of Us Is Lying.’And the best news is there are three more sequels to look forward to! I’ve already started my excitement dance, which is a blend of Beyoncé’s ‘All the Single Ladies’ moves and John Travolta’s ‘Staying Alive’ grooves. Yay!medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""You heard it here first, folks. I have found a newfavorite YA Thriller. I am stoked by how much I loved this!!For her Senior Capstone Project, Pippa Fitz-Amboi, an extraordinarily-focused high school girl, decides to solve a murder.Andie Bell, disappeared five years ago from Pippa's hometown; foul play was suspected.The police, and thus everyone else, believe Andie was murdered by her boyfriend at the time, Sal Singh, who subsequently disposed of the body.Their biggest piece of evidence, a purported confession Sal texted his parents, days after Andie disappeared. This confession was sent just prior to Sal's death, an apparent suicide.In spite of this, Pippa does not believe in Sal's guilt. Andie's body was never recovered and there is no real physical evidence linking him to her disappearance.Pippa is such a great character. She's an overachiever, who works tirelessly towards achieving her goals.You can tell, once she sets her sights on something, she will not give up and that's exactly how she tackles her Senior project.I think one of the things that connected me so much to this story was Pippa. I found her super relatable and loved reading from her perspective.She ends up befriending Sal's younger brother, Ravi. That additional commitment to him, and clearing Sal's name, makes Pippa even more steadfast; in spite of very real danger.Additionally, the format of this was creative and engaging. The use of mixed media sources, including the transcripts for the interviews from Pippa's investigation, and a present day narrative, made me feel like I was a part of the action.As Pippa is evaluating what she has learned along the way, she recaps things, as you actually would if you were working on this type of project; including a running list of current suspects tracked on her murder-board.The stakes were high and there were times Pippa was legitimately in very real danger. Through it all, she stayed true to herself and fought for justice for Andie and Sal.I loved this so much, as I said. I could go on for many more paragraphs of all the positive attributes of this story, but don't just take my word for it, PICK THIS UP!!!If you love it even half as much as I did, you're in for a good time! Well done by Holly Jackson. I am so excited to get more mysteries from her!!!""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '""Who do you think I am, an amateur?""Move aside, Nancy Drew! There\'s a new teen detective in town. And she won\'t rest until she\'s unearthed all your secrets and gotten to the bottom of a mystery that has long held her town captive.Pip never truly believed what all of Fairview has accepted: that Sal Singh murdered his beautiful and popular girlfriend Andie Bell and then killed himself. Five years later, Pip is a senior in high school, and decides for her final project that she\'s going to find out once and for all what really happened that night.I\'m always in the mood for a good whodunnit. Give me a small group of suspects, everyone hiding secrets, more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at, and red herrings galore, and I\'m in heaven. I loved putting on my detective cap and puzzling out the clues alongside Pip as she investigates and solves this mystery.For me, in order for a mystery to be successful, it has to be so riveting that there is no room for me to think. Once my mind gets going, it has this annoying habit of supplying me with random unsolicited guesses, some of which inevitably turn out to be right, and ruining the surprises. So it\'s best if I\'m so taken with the story that I\'m only surfacing to turn the pages as fast as I can. And this story was exactly that.I grew up on Nancy Drew, and have been looking for an older version of that for as long as I\'ve outgrown it. And how wonderful that this story turned out to be all that I\'ve been looking for and more. Pip is clever, spunky, and fearless, the perfect teen detective staring down secrets and murderers. And the fact that this is a series means I won\'t have to say goodbye to her just yet.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:#2.Good Girl, Bad Blood#3.As Good As Dead~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Rating: 1 star.Genuinely asking myself why I read this. This book had it all - bad writing, a completely unrealistic plot, white savior trope, ""I\'m not like other girls"", and probably the most annoying main character I have ever read about.For some reason, this teenager is allowed to start a massive murder investigation, where every possible witness tells her everything without her having to work for it, and - of course - she ends up doing what the police couldn\'t. The whole premise was just so unrealistic and unbelievable that I was annoyed from the very first page.The mystery itself was also barely a mystery at all, the pacing was off, things made no sense and everything was terribly convenient. Pip kept making random decisions and suspect basically everyone until she finally guessed the right person. At that point in the book, I was just counting down how many pages I still had to suffer through.Pip had no personality traits aside from her constant need to save everyone because she was such a good person and better than everyone else, which the reader was reminded of every second page. It\'s never explained why any of these people talk to Pip and basically tell her their entire life stories, or even why she cares enough to launch this entire investigation. Her character has no development and at the end of the novel, she\'s still exactly as annoying as she was on the very first page.I wish I hadn\'t read this, it clearly wasn\'t for me and a massive waste of time.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""can i sit at the cool kids table?i enjoyed a popular book. i think i'm well past due my invite at this point.this is a fun book that is sometimes really repetitive and sometimes really boring and only has half of a satisfying ending, and yet it's still a quick read.that is literally all i expect or desire from a popular YA mystery.bottom line: i'm going to read every book in this series until i ruin it for myself <3""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""This was good but just good.I think I'm getting too old to suspend my disbelief.

I\'m a busy mom of two, so it is rare for me to find a book so special that I can finish it in two sittings, but that\'s exactly what I found withA Good Girl\'s Guide to Murder.Pippa Fitz-Amobi is a true crime loving teen who aspires to become a top-notch journalist one day. So naturally, she decides to focus her senior capstone project on her small town\'s most buzz-worthy, unsolved crime: the murder of Andie Bell.

Here me out I got my reasons 🫣So I had a lot of fun reading it, the mystery surrounding Angie and Sal was really awesome. Pip and Ravi are likable characters and with intriguing personalities. The amount of work Pip put in to unravel the mystery was commendable and it's all for a school project 😅It's awell written and extremely well thought out book,no doubt, so kudos to the author there. Also the way she exposed racism via characters like Stanley is something I really liked. Let's be honest, people like him still exist. That was the only part in the book where the author was realistic...Cmon you expect me to believe a school girl solved this murder case when the big guys police, detectives can't do shit. I get there can be some sort of corruption involved in cases but no way a school kid is solving a murder that complicated without the consistent assistance of someone with experience. I don't care how intelligent Pip was, it's justextremely unrealistic.Also, it was kind of a bummer that Ravi didn't get that much of time in the book. I wanted to see him involved more often.Don't even get me started on the dog. Thelast 100 pages were really wild.So much happened, so many exposed and new questions arising. Am keen on starting with the next book already.It's definitely worth checking out but it's not anything special. Maybe the expectations got to me but I would suggest to anyone who reads this for the first time- go in with lowered expectations. I personally believe thatFive Survivewas the better book.~•~•~Y'all.. Am gonna do it🤞 Really hope it's worth the hype""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""Well, it appears, I've been reading YA mysteries all wrong these past years. Evidently, I should not expect plausibility, believability, character development or strong motivations in these books, like I do when reading adult mysteries. No wonder there is only ONE teen mystery that I think is good, and actual teens don't even like reading it, from what I hear. (It'sSadiein case you were wondering).A Good Girl's Guide to Murderstarts off as a Serial rip-off, with upstanding Pippa swooping in Sarah Koenig-like to clear the name of a poor brown guy accused of the murder of a popular girl whose body remains missing. You see, it's only Pippa who believes in Sal's innocence, and she will save the day, because she is a GOOD GIRL and Sal was once nice to her years ago! I was already annoyed at that point.However, from there this story devolves into a sleuthing adventure where Pippa manages to have every Tom, Dick and Harry confess all their misdoings to her, because PIPPA IS WRITING A SCHOOL PAPER ABOUT THE MURDER. She catphishes people, breaks into houses, blackmails drug dealers, discovers 5-year old evidence in plain view, because she is just so much better than the police at everything. I can understand why police wouldn't care to pursue a case of aWho Drew The D!cks or The Turd Bulrglarvariety, but a suicide and a presumed murder? And the victim is still missing and nobody but Pippa cares? Have you heard of Natalie Halloway? She disappeared 15 years ago, and she is still on TV. The whole investigation was one giant eyeroll for me.Anyway, to put it short, this book has nothing that I look for in a mystery. I am not reading any more YA mysteries if suspending disbelief entirely is the main requirement to get through them. I am just going to stick with Courtney Summers from now on. Thankfully she has another one coming out next year, and it's about cults!""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""The dad wouldn’t allow boys in the bedroom but was fully OK with Pip going on unsupervised co-ed sleepovers…….The best audiobook of the year!

Those lies were allowed.”I LOVE THIS SERIES SO MUCH 🫶I had the sudden urge to reread this series after reading a different murder mystery book and realizing that I am so good at reading those types of books quickly, so I was hoping and praying that they would get me out of my terrible reading slump, and since I just reread this entire series, I\'m really hoping it worked 😭🤞This is also such a good series to reread if you first read it a long time ago, because going into this I remembered nothing except for the basics and who the murderer was, but it was almost like reading it for the first time all over again which is such a good experience.∘◦ ✂ ————–✂ ◦∘The PlotAll of Holly Jackson\'s books have wild plots 😭 even in this reread I was gasping and feeling so confused and then almost crying.Murder mysteries always have a way of making me super stressed or tense or nervous but this trilogy is something else when it comes to that, there\'s just this certain undertone to them that make me so wrapped into the story-line that I forget about the real world and literally everything spooks me 😭I love that this book isn\'t super predictable. During my first read I was so confused, but I had so many guesses as to who the murderer was, or who any other suspects for any of the other small plot-lines were, but I never guessed who it was, which is always a good feeling. Though I get a good feeling when I get it right too, so either way, it\'d have been great 🤪Still never getting past acertainevent in this book.Thatscene has always stuck with me 😒“Pip wished she was strong enough, but she’d learned that she wasn’t invincible; she too could break.”∘◦ ✂ ————–✂ ◦∘The CharactersI know that we only really begin to see it in this book but Pip is an actual like psychotic genius or something. She is so smart and such a good detective, and she can solve mysteries in the amount of time that it would take for me to even start collecting the clues. Excluding that, she is also just such a relatable character, like if you disregard the fact that she solves murders and stuff then she\'s just a normal, relatable teenage girl! 🤷\u200d♀🤷\u200d♀ way better than me though, I wish I was more like Pip (only in this one though) she\'s also like crazy brave, I would not be able to do ANY of the things she did.Ravi is my KING. I\'ve always loved him, he\'s just so adorable and friendly and EVERYTHING. He\'s so loyal and seeing him try so hard to prove his brother\'s innocence is just so amazing, just showcasing his determination and passion. I also ADORE the fact that he\'s not afraid to show his emotions; like I\'ve read a lot of books about stone-cold guys who don\'t show emotions, like their grumpy and blah blah blah but Ravi is definitely not the grumpy one, I\'d say Pip is more of the grumpy one if that\'s the case, but Ravi tries hard to be sunshine and rainbows and I love it 👑🫅FUCK MAX HASTINGSI love Pip\'s friends (except for two people), they\'re just so fun and have a wide range of personalities 😃Yeah I didn\'t really care for them much, except I did really love Cara.“They were each other’s crutch to lean on when life got too much to carry alone.”∘◦ ✂ ————–✂ ◦∘The RelationshipsNow, there wasn\'t really much of a romance but it\'s kindaquiteobvious where one ""friendship"" is headed, so you\'ve been warned if you don\'t wanna see.I loved Pip\'s relationship with her family, it felt real and authentic, and they were all so cute, as well as her friendships, they were all just so loyal.All of those are insignificant in comparison to Team Pip and Ravi, my dream team. They mesh so well together that it\'s actually insane. They are the ONLY romance I have ever accepted in murder mysteries, which is saying a lot because I actually despise despise despise romances in murder mysteries, so these two are waaay up on a pedestal that even I can\'t reach right now.Also, the nickname Sarge is the cutest thing ever.“We’re a team, remember. You and me.”AH∘◦ ✂ ————–✂ ◦∘Overall, this was probably the last time I can ever read this book ""for the first time"" because I usually remember everything after the second read, which is unfortunate, but whateverI LOVE THIS SERIES SO MUCH5 stars(note: and if this stupid show isn\'t available in the US I\'m gonna scream my head off.)“Maybe laughter was one of the very first things you lost after something like that.”<><><><><><><>rereadeither Pip is some sort of genius or the cops in that town are actual idiots. i think it\'s bothanyways i\'m on a roll, two books in one week is great for someone who hasn\'t read since december AND i read this in 2 daysrtc 😜<><><><><><><>Y\'ALL I HEARD THEY\'RE MAKING A SHOW OUT OF THIS, THIS BETTER NOT BE A JOKE AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I NEED PIP AND RAVI HELP<><><><><><><>Holy cow, I did not expect that ending.

And it\'s also one of the first I\'ve read entirely in English, and as you know that Spanish is my native language, I assume you\'ll know that it was a bit complex. Although, I\'m adapting a bit more to reading in English. Wish me luck, folks.In A Good Girl\'s Guide to Murder we follow Pippa Fitz-Amobi, a 17-year-old student whose final year project is the case of Andie Bell, who was murdered by her boyfriend, Sal Singh and taken for granted by the police. But Pippa knows Sal is innocent, so she decides to find out what happened five years ago and whoreally killedAndie Bell.Pippa discovers that Andie had many secrets, that she was not the beautiful and tragic victim that the people of Little Kilton martyred and idolised, branding Sal Singh a murderer and a monster, treating his family very badly for it. In addition, Little Kilton holds even more secrets that intrigue Pip and make her want to keep digging to solve the mystery.Writing.I don\'t think I remember reading a book like this, with diary-like entries speaking in first person and then in third person. It was a bit strange, if I\'m honest, and it took me a bit longer to adjust. However, it was an easy read in some respects. And, I don\'t know if it\'s because of the difference between British and American English, but there were phrases that I had to look up because I didn\'t understand them, lmao.Plot.The plot kept me glued in my seat, not wanting to put my phone down, wanting to know what would happen next. I mention that I was late with this book because college is eating me alive, though I made time to keep reading because I was consumed with thoughts of not knowing what would happen, who the killer would be and if Pip was going to find out. There are a lot of plot twists that I wasn\'t expecting and a lot of things that made my brain almost melt from thinking about it so much.Pacing.It was a quick and light read, and I take back that I was late because of college: I would have finished it sooner if it weren\'t for homework. It\'s not that complicated to understand and the pages turn very quickly.Characters.Pip is a good girl, addicted to homework and determined to solve the Andie Bell case and prove that Sal Singh is innocent at all costs. So eager is she to find out what really happened, that she finds herself lying to others so that they won\'t worry about her and try to stop her from abandoning her project.Ravi is the younger brother of Sal Singh. He has been the target of criticism, and is known as the brother of Andie Bell\'s killer. Ravi knows his brother is innocent, and when Pip shows up at his door asking him a few questions, he thinks it\'s a joke. And soon, Ravi becomes Pip\'s partner in crime, both looking for answers about his brother\'s sudden death and his innocence in the case. Ravi is a beautiful little baby, don\'t touch him I want to take care of him.Also, Ravi: marry me.Andie was a bitch and it doesn\'t surprise me much that bad things happened to her. Everyone held her in such high regard, believing she was a good girl whose boyfriend murdered her. Andie ruined several people\'s lives, and although I thought I would feel bad that she had died, I didn\'t really. When you find out the truth about Andie Bell, what she did and didn\'t do, you don\'t feel any empathy for her.Cara is Pip\'s best friend, her older sister is Naomi, who was in turn Sal\'s best friend and who also keeps a big secret that makes Pip dig very closely into her and her life, including her family.(Bonus and unnecessary fact:Cara translates from Spanish to English as: \'face\' and \'expensive\'.Unnecessary examples:Sucaraes hermosa= her face is beautiful.

She\'s a good girl who starts to lie for her project and she doesn\'t feel the same anymore. I mean, idk, I can\'t put it into words, I just hope she felt morerealand not flat.Second, how quick all of the possible suspects told Pip the truth, when they lied to the police or omitted information. I found it quite unbelievable and a little bit ilogic. Also, Mr. Ward confessed really quick and it felt dry... I don\'t quite know how to explain it, but I was expecting more. Becca Bell also confessed really quick, and spilled her secrets out as she were talking about the weather, which also felt a little bit bitter.aND THE FINAL STRAW: BARNEY. NO. NO. NO.

Ustedes saben que llevo tiempo interesada en leer thrillers y este me lo habían recomendado un montón, luego vi las reseñas y terminé por convencerme, ¡no me arrepiento!Pippa, la protagonista, es un ser fácil de querer, jajaja. Sí siento que a veces era demasiado impulsiva y no medía las consecuencias de sus actos, pero aún así solo quería que todo le saliera bien. No sé, como protagonista me pareció dinámica y divertida y carismática, en ningún momento me cansé de seguirla en su investigación :). DIGO, sí llegué a pensar que estaba llevando las cosas muy lejos, pero se me hizo un personaje tan bien construido, que sus acciones tenían sentido (tipo de: ""¡eso es tan Pippa!"").AWWW, además no me esperaba al interés amoroso y, aunque la historia no se centra para nada en el romance, se me hizo una parejita súper bonita AND I WAS ROOTING FOR THEM.El elemento principal de la historia es el misterio y está súper bien llevado. El libro te atrapa desde el primer momento y es imposible de soltar. Además, a mí me pareció poco predecible. Teníamos a varios sospechosos y TODOS PODÍAN SER CULPABLES. Todos tenían sus razones muy fuertes. ¿Y adivinen qué? Obviamente no le atiné, jajajaja.Eso sí, no sé si continuar con la trilogía porque creo que este libro terminó muy bien así. Pero quién sabe, no estoy cerrada a las posibilidades.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'I’m very concerned for this author, it appears they have never once met a real human being in their life…..'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'this story is giving off such strong ‘serial’ vibes that i can only imagine how amazing listening to the audiobook version would have been.a re-investigation of a cold case, including detailed diagrams and evidence files, with a really interesting mystery and suspects - what more could you want? this is every true crime enthusiasts dream story.the one thing preventing me from giving this five stars is the same thing i tend to find obnoxious about most YA mystery/thrillers - the need to include every crime imaginable. this murder revolves arounddrugs, rape, pedophilia, underaged drinking, cyberbullying, child abuse, vehicular assault,and a lot more. by the end of the story, its just too farfetched to be realistically believable. such a shame.but overall, this story is solidly entertaining, one that i would have absolutely no problem recommending to people. now excuse me while i go redownload the entire first season of ‘serial’ to listen to again.↠4 stars'}, {'rating': None, 'content': '❥07/09/24i’m honestly drowning in pain reading boys of tommen so i just need a little break🥺a big thanks to my brother for gifting me this series🥹🫶🏼i better love this😩'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'OMG QUÉ WHAT WOW.Tenía ganas de leer este libro desde hacía tiempo. No es que hubiera leído muchas reseñas positivas ni nada por el estilo, perome daba esa sensación misteriosa que algunos libros te dan y sabes que necesitas leerlo y que te va a gustar.Sabéis a lo que me refiero, ¿no?EnAsesinato para principiantestenemos una trama que sinceramente me ha sorprendido muy positivamente.Losthrillersjuveniles de este estilo, a lo Natasha Preston o incluso Sara Shepard, suelen quedarse a veces un poco en la superficie de todo. Bueno, quizá no es la superficie, pero sí queme suele faltar un poco que me construyan mejor todo. Y es que Holly Jackson no escatima en detalles.A ver,el libro te agarra desde el primer momento.Yo normalmente leo el primer capítulo de un libro para decidir si va a ser mi próxima lectura o no, y en este caso es que llevaba página y media y dije pOR DIOS, SÍ, ESTO TIENE QUE SER MÍO.El estilo de la autora hace que te introduzcas de lleno en la historia, y lo mejor de todo, es que no es solo unthriller.Para que un libro de estas características funcione, o por lo menos para mí es esencial, tiene que tener una buena protagonista con la que conecte, entienda y quiera luchar por ella. Pip es así.La construcción del personaje no es algo accesorio, al contrario. Holly Jackson se centra bastante en tener una protagonista muy definida, conociendo detalles de su vida privada, relaciones con amigos y demás.No hace que el ritmo del libro bajey no hace tampoco que te impacientes para descubrir qué está pasando en el pueblo. La manera en la que Jackson maneja el espacio entre escenas me ha gustado mucho.No es muy normal para mí ponerle 5 estrellas a un libro de este género. No sé por qué, la verdad, peropuedo recordar pocas ocasiones donde unthrillerme haya volado la cabeza tantísimo.Pero es que enAsesinato para principiantestenemosuna historia que está perfectamente hilada, que se desarrolla lentamente pero con decenas de giros, y que te atrapa cada vez más porque se va convirtiendo en una locura cada vez más increíble.De hecho, le han visto el increíble potencial que tiene y los derechos audiovisuales han sido comprados. Esperemos que la cosa fluya y tengamos a Pippa y Ravi en la gran (o pequeña) pantalla, porque de verdad,este libro es increíble.Tenemos toda la trama de misterio, sobre qué pasó con Addie Bell y Sal Singh, cuyas averiguaciones van poniéndote los pelos de punta cada vez más.Los métodos para descubrir mentiras o verdades a medias de Pip son de aplaudir, porque es una chica muy inteligente y que no le tiene miedo a nada: tan solo persigue la verdad y la justicia.Una de mis cosas favoritas del libro es lowokeque es la autora.Pippa tiene un padrastro -al que llama padre- de origen nigeriano, su nuevo mejor amigo es indio y una de sus amigas es lesbiana. Y dirás: “¡pero la protagonista sigue siendo blanca! ¡Es una privilegiada!” Y así es. Y, de hecho, es tan así que hasta ella misma lo dice.Hay situaciones de racismo en el libro en las que Pippa habla sobre tener privilegios por ser blanca, sobre cómo puede tener actitudes racistas pese a haberse criado con un padre negro…Me ha encantado que en un libro de misterio aparentemente solo de eso, se debatan o comenten este tipo de temas sociales.También se habla de machismo, abusos sexuales…En general, es un libro con temas de actualidad, y quizá la excusa para tratarlos es el misterio. (Aunque tampoco es que la crítica sea una pieza central, no nos confundamos.)Sin embargo,con lo que más me quedo deAsesinato para principianteses con la pedazo de trama de Holly Jackson y cómo está organizada. Os prometo que es increíble la cantidad de capas que tiene la historia, la cantidad de personajes relacionados… Es que sigo sin palabras.Qué maravilla.Ahora solo queda esperar a ver si traen el segundo pronto a España, porque si no…Amazon, is that you?(También os digo, que me da mucha rabia hacer la reseña sin spoilers. Se me queda corta comparada con todo lo que quiero hablar, pero no quiero joderos la experiencia. Confiad en mí cuando os digo que os va a flipar este libro.)Tw: tramas sobre suicidio, asesinatos, violaciones, abusos sexuales, pedofilia, muerte de animales, consumo de drogas y alcoholismo.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""⋆｡˚ 💌 ᝰ .ᐟ4.80 stars–no spoilers˗ˏˋoverall thoughts´ˎ˗this book still holds such a special place in my heart—from the characters, to the mystery, to the found-family, to the entire fandom and everything else. 💗💗💗 PIP, RAVIIIII 🫸🫸🫸˗ˏˋcharacters´ˎ˗✦pip:she's such a queen!! she was so smart!✦ravi:OMGGGG, RAVIIIIII!!

But Pippa Fitz-Amobi thinks that Sal is not the killer. She chooses this case as the topic for her final year, Senior Capstone Project. She is trying to find the mystery behind Andie Bell\'s case. Was Sal the real killer? If not, is Pippa\'s life in danger? Will the killer try to hurt Pippa so that she won\'t be able to solve the case? Holly Jackson will answer all these questions through this book.What I learned from this book1) What is hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia?This is an interesting new word I learned from this book. Its meaning is fear of long words.“Pip knew a great many things; she knew thathippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobiawas the technical term for the fear of long words.”2) What happens to all the missing people?The author shares some interesting statistics related to the missing people in this book. This will help us to know what actually happens to the missing people.“I found these statistics: 80% of missing people are found in the first twenty-four hours. 97% are found in the first week, and 99% of cases are resolved in the first year. That leaves just 1%. 1% of people who disappear are never found. And just 0.25% of all missing persons cases have a fatal outcome.""3) What is toxic productivity, and how can it hurt our life?Few of my friends and patients are obsessed with watching productivity videos on YouTube. Productivity is always good in our life. But when it reaches such a level that we always try to be productive in all areas of life, it might reach toxic levels. Are the online productivity gurus hurting people\'s lives instead of helping them? This serious question can only be answered after more profound research and understanding.The author indirectly mentions toxic productivity in a couple of areas in this book.“What\'s wrong with me? ... I might seem like the ideal student: homework always in early, every extra credit and extracurricular I can get my hands on, the good girl and the high achiever. But I realized something just now: it\'s not ambition, not entirely. It\'s fear. Because I don\'t know who I am when I\'m not working, when I\'m not focused on or totally consumed by a task. Who am I between the projects and the assignments, when there\'s nothing to do? I haven\'t found her yet and it scares me.""“Your efficiency offends me.”My favourite three lines from this book“Half less of a bad thing meant there was room for half good.”“The people you love weren’t algebra: to be calculated, subtracted, or held at arm’s length across a decimal point.”""But sometimes remembering isn\'t for yourself, sometimes you do it just to make someone else smile. Those lies were allowed.""What could have been better?If you are someone who attended Med School, you will know how some patients try to avoid Med School students saying that they are not Doctors even after knowing they will be Doctors in a couple of years.If we look at the world from the angle of the people I mentioned above, it will be difficult to believe that a teenager is going for an important murder investigation like this, and almost every person connected to it treating her like a real grown-up police officer/ detective and fully cooperating with her and telling her everything they know. It, in fact, looks totally unrealistic from any practical human being\'s point of view.Rating3.5/5This is a real page-turner with many twists that will satisfy most of the readers.—————————————————————————You can also follow me onInstagram ID - Dasfill|YouTube Channel ID - Dasfill|YouTube Health Channel ID - Dasfill - Health|YouTube Malayalam Channel ID - Dasfill - Malayalam|Threads ID - Dasfill|Twitter ID - Dasfill1|Snapchat ID - Dasfill|Facebook ID - Dasfill|TikTok ID - Dasfill1'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""3.5/5 ✧･ﾟi have finally finished this and i'm not sure entirely how i feel - i think i'm going to give it 3.5 stars for now? i definitely enjoyed it, but the ending was a little... i don't know maybe i wasn't following as closely as i should of? 𓍢ִ໋🌷͙֒︶︶︶ ⊹ ︶︶︶⠀୨♡୧⠀︶︶︶ ⊹ ︶︶︶╰┈➤Plot:This was overall enjoyable, it was YA so I didn't feel a gripe in my stomach (but I did in Five Survive).

A lot of the points Pip (the main character) though 'oh that's suspicious!' - I think a normal person wouldn't have thought that and all. I get that's the point of her character, she 'overthinks', finds leads and chases them down like a bloodhound. To me, whilst this book discusses some really important topics, I didn't find it thrilling.I also didn't guess who did it, but I was hoping Sal would have a bigger part to play, considering how him and Andie's relationship is pictured?.I know I've just trashed on the plot so you might be wondering why it's still such a high rating -╰┈➤Characters:All the characters were loveable.Pipis your typical quirky and super intelligent female YA MC.

",Sally Rooney,3.81,1567053,6986,"Fiction, Contemporary, Literary Fiction, Audiobook, Ireland, Adult, Coming Of Age",273,28-08-2018,"At school Connell and Marianne pretend not to know each other. He’s popular and well-adjusted, star of the school soccer team while she is lonely, proud, and intensely private. But when Connell comes to pick his mother up from her housekeeping job at Marianne’s house, a strange and indelible connection grows between the two teenagers - one they are determined to conceal.A year later, they’re both studying at Trinity College in Dublin. Marianne has found her feet in a new social world while Connell hangs at the sidelines, shy and uncertain. Throughout their years in college, Marianne and Connell circle one another, straying toward other people and possibilities but always magnetically, irresistibly drawn back together. Then, as she veers into self-destruction and he begins to search for meaning elsewhere, each must confront how far they are willing to go to save the other.Sally Rooney brings her brilliant psychological acuity and perfectly spare prose to a story that explores the subtleties of class, the electricity of first love, and the complex entanglements of family and friendship.","[{'rating': 4, 'content': ""“Life offers up these moments of joy despite everything.”(see my instagram review:https://www.instagram.com/p/C2zr6VgLlVN/)The first time I read this, I rated it three stars. While this can be considered relatively high for me (don’t check my average rating, it will only bring despair to us both), it is approximately two stars lower than what I expected to rate this book.I adore Rooney’s prior novel, Conversations with Friends, to a degree that is almost disturbing. Or possibly just disturbing.But this one fell flat for me. In a way that was difficult, at the time, to put a finger on. While I encountered the same stellar, almost painful writing, and the same reading experience so all-encompassing that it felt like it changed something fundamental about me, while I loved the characters so much that my concern for their well-being stressed me out, I did not come away from this book in love.I put a finger on what the thing keeping me and this book away from eternal love and matrimony was.It’s because I was sad.The first time I read this, I was so wrapped up in the characters and their lives and my concern for them that I overlooked...everything else. To me this was the story of Connell and Marianne and nothing else, and while I adored them both I missed out on the multitude of nuances and themes and symbols at play. The treatment of privilege and wealth, the examination of capitalism through relationships, the look at what love and self-worth mean, the submission and sometimes humiliation that is love.This is a gorgeous book, and a beautifully written one, and the second read of this enthralled me so much I lived in the story for a week.For once, I’m at a loss for what else to say.Bottom line: I was wrong, okay!!! There’s a first time for everything.p.s. In the original review I say that I'll never reread this book. That wrongness counts as the same one.---------------------reread 2 updatesi am swiftly abandoning this reread because i'm not enjoying it and i'm scared.update: resuming in light of how soon sally rooney's next book is coming out. still scared.update to the update: this stays 4 stars!---------------------reread pre-reviewraising this from 3 to 4 stars upon reread, so guess i have to rewrite this review.oh, the twists and turns life takes.review to come / 4 stars---------------------reread 1 updatesmaybe someday i will be the kind of person who doesn't take every excuse to reread, but today is not that day---------original reviewWhen I finished this book, I didn’t even rate it. I couldn’t. I had no clue how to even approach such a thing.I still don’t.That’s because I loved reading every single word of this (because every single word of this was written by Sally Rooney), but I also, in a much more real way, did not enjoy at all.Conversations with Friends, which I five starred, reread just a few months after my first read, and have not stopped thinking about, is not an easy book to read. I adore it, but I did not enjoy every second of it.Far from it, actually. That book’s characters are part of my heart, but I didn’t necessarilylikethem. I felt intensely and deeply known by its story, and that process doesn’t necessarily feel like a walk in a park.Well, maybe it is. But on one of those days where when you first go outside the temperature is perfect in a long-sleeve shirt, but then you spend every minute outside growing slightly chillier to the point of discomfort. And you’re excited to see the park has little ice-cream carts, but then you realize the process of eating the ice cream ultimately won’t live up to your imagining of it, and you don’t really like ice cream all that much anyway.If that’s Conversations with Friends…Normal People is a walk in a park during a blizzard. Without a jacket. And to distract yourself you have an ongoing internal monologue that’s actually sort of brilliant, you’re in rare form, and that’s great and all but it’s not quite enough to distract from the fact that all of this seems pointless and rather painful.It really seems to me that Rooney abandoned the gorgeous, deep characterizations and slow-moving stories of Conversations in favor of making characters vessels for themes.And I’ve simply never been that kind of a reader. I read FOR the characters, not around them.I didn’t much care for Connell and Marianne, nor their romance (if you can call it that). I couldn’t click with their arcs or their escapades or much of anything, besides Rooney’s writing. (Which was unchangedly amazing and possibly even better.)There were also some things about this that made me feel...icky. Sexual submission (specifically Marianne’s) is used as a metaphor here, and never kindly. This behavior of hers is presented as negative, usually, but it’s also inarguable that Marianne is submissive in her relationship with Connell, and that is never resolved. Connell feels unhappy several times over about the degree of her power over her, and while they return to their relationship contentedly towards the end, this is not at all resolved.I missed the lovely, tied-strings ending of Conversations.Conversations made me feel heard, made my heart and brain feel full, and Normal People made me feel...almost dumb. As if I was missing something that would have helped me put it all together, and without it of course it felt incomplete, silly, because I didn’t have the intellectual capacity to complete it.It’s possible this just isn’t the book I needed, when Conversations with Friends certainly was.It was still written by Sally Rooney, though.Bottom line: I will never reread this. Also I desperately need more Rooney.Update: I reread.---------------------pre-reviewi......cannot even rate this right now.review to come, when i regain the ability to think---------------------tbr reviewi want Sally Rooney to write my internal monologue""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Disclaimer: I understand thatNormal Peopleis very popular and much beloved. While I recognise that Rooney has talent, I foundNormal Peopleto be a mediocre read. If you dislike reading reviews expressing opinions different from your own, well, I suggest you skip this review. There are plenty of glowing reviews out there for this novel so there really is no need for you to waste your time leaving me a comment along the lines of \'you are wrong and here\'s why\'. Also, note that I wrote this review in 2018 and not recently.If you believe that characters who dislike themselves, shrug a lot, and say ""I don\'t know"" 24/7, are very deep and realistic, well this may be the perfect read for you.Or if you enjoy reading about ""in"" authors...look no further.If you are thinking about reading this novel, I suggest you listen toCrywank\'s \'Song for a Guilty Sadist\'instead, since it will take you less time and you will get the same story.At first I enjoyed Rooney\'s style, the way in which she juxtaposed ordinary moments with emotionally charged ones and the uncertainty that pervaded her story, but I soon found her style rather hollow and impersonal, in a manner that soon became predictable. There was a flatness to her voice that seemed affected, and gave her story an artificial quality. I had the impression that Rooney was trying to conjure a certain millennial ""vibe"" through her characters and their experiences, one that isn\'t all that effective or interesting.The central figures of her novel, Connell and Marianne, lacked depth and, as stupid as it might sound, character. Their looks were emphasised in a way that made them ""stand out"" from others: they are skinny and beautiful, they smoke, they make languid movements, they are smart, and unlike their peers they actually care about world politics. Throughout the course of this novel we are told howdifferentandspecialthey are, that\'s literally me type of characters.Marianne comes from a wealthy and abusive family (we are supposed to feel bad for her), Connell was raised by his mother and suffers from bouts of anxiety and depression (we are also supposed to feel bad for him). That they have issues that they can\'t cope with is realistic, but what I didn\'t appreciate is the romanticising of their difficulties. What I didn\'t like is that being ""alienated"" is synonym of ""cool"" and that seeking sadomasochistic relationships is understandable/inevitable if you come from an abusive family (i understand that this happens, and a lot of media manages to portray this reality, that of being a victim who either choose or fall into toxic relationship, or actively seek partners or friendships that emulate old patterns of abuse, with nuance, depth even. but rooney doesn\'t, for all her attempts at candid reality, her depiction of this struck me as sentimental and simplistic).Rooney handles serious issues (eg. an abusive family, depression, etc.) very badly (a book that handles trauma and self-harming incredibly well isWhat Red WasbyRosie Price), there we seewhythe characters behave in self-destructive ways, but in NP these things seemmerely props).Marianne and Connell aren\'t terrible people but god, they are so self-involved. Their relationship is made to appear fraught but I didn\'t always understand why. Drama for the sake of drama? They enter forgettable relationships with equally forgettable people but they remain fixated on each other.Why?No one knows...Marianne is depicted by the author and the other characters as being the sort of person who does not to care about others\' opinion of her but soon after a breakup with a cliched dick boyfriend she is obsessed with what people are saying about her...Connor is...intelligent? Indecisive? As interesting as a stale sandwich?!Secondary characters and family members are barely sketched out, they have little to no purpose other than creating more ""drama"" for the main characters. Marianne\'s family was so badly written that I had a hard time taking any of them seriously. Her brother is laughably cruel and her mother is uncaring and snobbish (they are rich so...). Friends from college serve very little purpose, other than making the main characters seem ""different"" and ""real"" (they are special, not like other people).What I disliked the most is that by the end neither Marianne or Connell show any sort of character growth/change. Not that I always want to read about characters who learn from their mistakes or gain some sort of insight from their experience, I can appreciate characters who keep perpetuating their \'bad\' behaviour or even those who get worse or regress into \'bad\' habits/behaviour, some of my favourite novels feature characters unable or unwilling to put an end to their self-sabotaging ways. But they have to be believable. Marianne or Connell were not. They were merely an \'aesthetic\', more befitting as subjects of a black and white grunge photo than anything else.The only reason why I finished this novel is that I listened to the audiobook and the narrator managed to make this otherwise unappetising storyline sort of okay.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Let it be known that I found this book both exhilarating and almost unbearably frustrating. About halfway through the book I literally lied down on my couch and screamed to my empty apartment, “Connell, you aresuchan incompetent communicator, I swear to God herself if you don’t help yourself I’m going to loathe every person named Connell I ever encounter for the rest of my life.” Even though I’m giving this book 2 stars, it’s more out of how invested I felt in the characters and how little I felt Sally Rooney capitalized on their potential, and not out boredom – I felt anything but bored reading this novel.I will start with what I liked aboutNormal Peoplebefore I continue roasting Connell. Now having read bothConversations with FriendsandNormal People, I find Rooney’s dialogue so, so sharp and entertaining. It’s witty and interesting and realistic, smart yet sincere enough so that it rarely feels pretentious. Some combination of how she writes dialogue and scenes is just so compelling, like I felt propelled to keep reading even when I felt tired of Connell and Marianne and their poor choices. Rooney also weaves in astute commentary about class and socioeconomic status. A few of the passages about class really made me pause and reflect on my own socioeconomic privilege, which I appreciate. At the same time, my best friend pointed out how ultimately Marianne and Connell’s whiteness both afford them the opportunity to be continually mediocre in ways that people of color are often not given, which I agree with.Which brings me to my main critique of this book: Connell and Marianne’s relationship felt so, so annoying and inhibiting. It honestly felt like reading an interpersonal train wreck that I could not look away from, even though I would have much rather looked at anything else (e.g., attractive actors like Steven Yeun, BlackPink music videos, the ceiling of my apartment, etc.) On one hand, I totally get and appreciate that people miscommunicate with one another and experiencing or working through miscommunications is part of life. But Connell and Marianne’s miscommunication literally drives the plot of this book for like, the first 200 pages, and even after that they never really have an explicit conversation about their communication and its indirectness? The majority of this book felt like: Marianne and Connell are intimate, then they have a miscommunication (probably caused by Connell), then they somehow reunite and are intimate again, but then they have another miscommunication (also probably Connell’s fault, like yes I get class factors into this but dang he’s a poor communicator), then they’re intimate, then they miscommunicate, etc. until the end.Finally, I felt like Marianne’s character had so much unexplored depth and potential. She goes through so much: abandonment, familial abuse, trauma and disordered eating, to name a few. Rooney did such a nice job showing some of the effects of her experiences on her psyche and view of relationships. Yet, instead of really going deeper into her struggles or her potential path to healing, Rooney dedicates the majority of the book to Marianne’s relationship with Connell, which I found almost insulting to Marianne’s character. I recognize I may be being a bit harsh here, on one hand I get that Marianne is desperate for some form of healthy connection as we all are to some extent, yet I so, so wish Rooney had given Marianne the chance to heal or develop more within the scope of the novel, so we could see that on the page and feel that hope for her. Instead, toward the very end of the book, Marianne essentially attributes all the goodness in her life to Connell, which made me blanch a little (while sitting on the same couch in which I cursed Connell’s name).Despite my 2-star rating of this novel and my 3-star rating ofConversations with Friends, I still feel somewhat compelled to try out whatever book Rooney publishes next, just because of the sheer addictiveness of her dialogue. There is some quality content inNormal People, about consent and power within sex, about mental health and help-seeking as well. I wish there had been more growth for these characters, outside of their relationship, especially for Marianne.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'No one can be independent of other people completely, so why not give up the attempt, she thought, go running in the other direction, depend on people for everything, allow them to depend on you, why not.This is going to be a polarizing book. I mean, IthinkI liked it. And I say ""liked it"" in the sense that it made me very miserable. It is a quiet character study, almost a YA novel but not quite, and it is aprofoundly lonely and depressing love story.I didn\'t begin by liking it.Normal Peoplefollows two characters - Marianne and Connell - through adolescence and into early adulthood, and they begin by being the kind of uber-precocious teenagers who read Proust and Marx for fun. It took a while for me to settle into their story. My initial impression was that this was going to be some kind ofJohn Greenfor adults, which is not something that floats my particular boat.Without fully realizing it though, this book had crept quietly under my skin. The relationship between Marianne and Connell is angsty, sure, but it felt painfully real. They are so flawed, marred by unlikable characteristics, and yet,I could not stop caring about them.Not for the first time Marianne thinks cruelty does not only hurt the victim, but the perpetrator also, and maybe more deeply and more permanently. You learn nothing very profound about yourself simply by being bullied; but by bullying someone else you learn something you can never forget.The story is really just about the two of them and their relationship. In high school, Marianne is a smart and wealthy girl, but is socially ostracized and emotionally abused at home, whereas Connell is working class, but very popular. Connell\'s mum works as a cleaner for Marianne\'s family. They begin a secret sexual relationship that falls apart when Connell fears his friends will find out. The compelling dynamic between them drives the story-- issues of class and social status cause much conflict.In college, the two meet again. This time, Marianne is popular, and Connell is feeling increasingly depressed. The two of them lean on each other time and again as they move through a social world filled with social expectations. There\'s a bit of aWhen Harry Met Sallyvibe, except that this book is more soul-destroying.Nothing had meant more to Rob than the approval of others; to be thought well of, to be a person of status. He would have betrayed any confidence, any kindness, for the promise of social acceptance.There\'s clear criticism of our constant need to impress and perform for others in a world that grows ever more connected. Much of the tragedy that befalls Marianne and Connell is caused by other people, peer pressure and social expectations. It is very sad to think that someone might give up who they love the most because they can\'t deal with how it makes them look to others.The pair\'s inability to adequately communicate is frustrating but feels realistic. I was on the verge of tearing my hair out at all the things left unsaid in this book, but I think it was a good kind of frustration. The kind that comes from caring too much.I feel like there are any number of reasons I could have hatedNormal People, but I didn’t. I actually kinda loved it. It\'s a weird, awkward, depressing novel about a connection formed between two very different people who find exactly what they need - and perhaps a lot that they don\'t - in each other.CW: sexual assault; domestic abuse; drug use; casual racism (called out); depression; anxiety; suicide & suicidal ideation.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""***NO SPOILERS***This is one of the most overrated books I've read in a long time, and I'mstunnedit was long-listed for the Women's prizeandthe Booker prize (but then, I usually dislike what's chosen for that). The critics are gushing over it too. A professional review I saw in “Book Page” calls it “wise and wondrous.” I ask this:How? How is Rooney’s message “wise”? Show me what’s “wondrous.” I’ve read wondrous and wise many times before. Those are the transportive books I never forget. They overwhelm me in the best way. Everything aboutNormal Peopleunderwhelmed me.Although Rooney’s simplistic prose makesNormal Peopleeasy to read, the book is poorly organized, overly sexual, plot-less, and ultimately never comes together in a satisfying way. Considering how ordinary, often boring, most people’s lives are, her book actuallyisabout “normal people,” but I expect authors to dress up the everyday. I expect tension, some drama, maybe a little suspense. I need a plot with a compelling reason for being. Normal people’s lives don’t make for good stories as they are; they require tinkering. A story about two friends-with-benefits who are confused about what they mean to each other isn’t a story. It’s merely the rough outline for a layered, more meaningful story.Rooney’s intention was a story about miscommunication between close friends as they grow and have various life experiences—except there is no miscommunication. The characters are clear about how they feel. They profess their love for each other more than once. They have sex all the time. They show each other care and consideration. What I saw was unexplainable hesitance. In high school Marianne is unpopular and rich; Connell is popular and poor, so early on this difference drives their hesitance and makes sense. I thought then thatNormal Peoplewas going to be an exploration of how class and social difference can harm a relationship, a kind of contemporaryRomeo and Juliet. Instead Rooney dropped this as soon as the characters move on to college, and their hesitance no longer makes sense.Where these characters’ class differences are concerned, development is shallow. Rooney didn’t illustrate how Marianne is unpopular and Connell popular or how Marianne is rich and Connell poor. She said that Marianne lives in a big house; she showed Connell’s housekeeper mother working for Marianne’s family a few times. That’s it, and Rooney could just as easily have made them the same level of popular and of the same class.I was continually confused about, or forgot, most of the secondary characters because none have distinguishing features or much, if anything, to do. Marianne’s mother isn’t shown, just talked about matter-of-factly a few times. A cruel brother pops up here and there to dole out cruelty, then disappears. A boyfriend is callous and doesn’t stick around long enough to do anything interesting. A sub-plot about abuse is mildly intriguing, but it’s also arbitrary and ends in a flash. They all tease, hinting atNormal People’s unrealized potential to be phenomenal.Of course normal people have lives that can change drastically and in unpredictable and sad ways, but translating that to the page necessitates a concrete story arc. I understand why some critics have called this book “stream-of-consciousness.” Rooney didn’t employ thatwriting technique, but the events, jumping as they do from one disconnected thing to the next, flashing backward and forward confusingly, are stream-of-consciousness in plot form. As a writing style, stream-of-consciousness is horrible, but in plot form it’s disastrous. I’ll give Rooney another try withConversations with Friendsbut with the lowest expectations.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Sally Rooney is the real dealNormal Peoplehas been lavished with praise from critics, longlisted for the Man Booker prize andadapted for television by the BBC. And that\'s just in its first week of publication!All that attention will, no doubt, attract quite a few readers who would not ordinarily touch this subject with a barge pole. Because this book:A)\tIs about young peopleB)\tIs a love story (but not a \'romance novel\')C)\tContains a fair bit of sex (which is crucial to the storytelling, btw, and is not graphic)All of which (possibly also the fact that the author is a 27-year-old woman) means thatNormal Peoplewill inevitably be dismissed by some as frivolous. It isn’t. This is a confident, accomplished and serious work.Of Rooney’s debut,Conversations with Friends, I said in my review it ‘occasionally scrapes close to the bone’. Well,Normal Peoplecuts to the core.Normal Peopleis not out to inspire, instruct, entertain or talk down to anyone, which makes it something of a refreshing anomaly in current fiction about young people. It is a novel (for anyone, young or old) that simply presents the truth of youthful experiences without the filters of nostalgia or sentimentality. It invites you to inhabit the psyche of someone else – two someone elses: Connell and Marianne – to identify with them and to feel their pain and turmoil. For the reader who connects to that, it is wracking.The story focuses only on the pivotal moments for these two characters, jumping forward three weeks, six months, or five minutes, as needed, to excise all the uneventful bits of life and leave us with the most emotionally intense supercut possible. It follows them from high school in a small town, through their years at university in Dublin, as the dynamic between them shifts with their surroundings and social circle. They’re not officially \'together\' the whole time, or even most of the time, but they always figure in each other’s lives in a significant way.Sally Rooney writes with such precision that this all feels painfully true. She conjures the tension and emotion in a scene just from the way someone wrings out a dish sponge; she conveys the full weight of feeling from a look or a shrug. In Rooney’s imagining, Connell and Marianne as separate entities are less important than the interplay between them – their relationship dynamic and the influence each of them has on shaping the other, that’s the real stuff of this book:""How strange to feel herself so completely under the control of another person, but also how ordinary. No one can be independent of other people completely, so why not give up the attempt, she thought, go running in the other direction, depend on people for everything, allow them to depend on you, why not.""There’s irony here, and self-conscious posturing (though not nearly as much as in CWF), but earnestness, truth and kindness as well. In addition to the central relationship are issues of class and intellectual integrity. It\'s a particularly astute look at the rebuild of self that teenagers undergo in the transition from school to uni, how it allows some to thrive while others stumble, and in some ways is just an illusion after all.So there’s hype and there’s backlash to the hype, andNormal Peopleis sure to resonate powerfully with some readers and not at all for others. If you like a minutely observed novel about people and feelings that isn’t mawkish, I\'d say give it a go.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""On the second page of Sally Rooney’s universally acclaimed, Booker- longlisted novel is the following paragraph:‘He puts his hands in his pockets and suppresses an irritable sigh, but suppresses it with an audible intake of breath, so that it still sounds like a sigh.’What?I get the hand in the pockets bit, but how the hell does the rest of it work? A sigh is an exhalation and I have no idea how any attempt to suppress a sigh by inhaling could possibly sound like one. I’ve tried hard to imagine it, but no luck. I’ve tried even harder to do it, but even less luck. In fact, in an effort to understand this twaddle I have tried it so often that I have come close on several occasions to hyperventilating and passing out.What have those Faber editors been doing? Maybe they have no problem with it because they are all so much cleverer than me and know how to read properly. Or maybe they also tried to do it and actually did pass out, which might explain why they have failed to apply the editorial pencil with any intelligence in the 264 pages that follow.The more likely explanation, of course, is that the problem is mine – and I offer the following gems from Normal People on that understanding…• ‘He looks down into his lap, and exhales quickly, almost like a cough’.It’s hyperventilation time again. I’ve imagined it and I’ve tried it, but I still don’t get it.• ‘He can’t even visually imagine himself as a lawyer, wearing a tie and so on..’Do we really need that ‘visually’?• ‘It’s true she is Connell’s type, maybe even the originary model of the type:’Originary? What does that mean? Am I the only one who had to look it up? (It’s not in Chambers, by the way, so you’ll need the OED)• ‘Peggy, watching, took a performatively large mouthful of Cointreau…’Can anyone explain what ‘performatively large’ actually means?• ‘Enraged now, Alan wrenched her back from the sink by her upper arm, and, seemingly spontaneously, spat at her.’Seemingly spontaneously?I could go on. It’s not often that I feel the need to read with a pencil in my hand but Normal People drove me to it, and my copy is now covered with question marks and annotations. I retired from teaching last year but reading Sally Rooney’s feted novel felt like I was marking again - in this case marking the work of a precocious, but overindulged, talent.In 'Normal People' alternating points of view are combined with an inconsistent and confusing authorial presence, voices are often difficult to differentiate in an ineffectual free indirect style, the comma splices (Ferrante this isn’t) and the unpunctuated dialogue, far from creating an impressionistic flow, suggest a lack of precision, and the prose shifts from past to present for no apparent reason and even within paragraphs, creating a chronological blur. In short, it's a bit of a mess.If I cared about the characters or cared about the story, these things would not matter quite so much but on the few occasions when I saw through the writerly mess I found it difficult to care about them at all.The novel, though, has been so well received that its very reception has become a news story. ‘Salinger for the Snapchat generation’: critics unite to praise 27 year-old novelist’ was the headline in last Saturday’s Guardian.So the problem is clearly mine.Maybe I've read a different book from the one everyone is raving about. Maybe I've read the same book but don't know how to read properly. Or it could be that I'm the child's voice at the back of the crowd politely suggesting that the emperor might not be wearing any clothes.""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'I am not sure how to write this review because I seem to be so far beyond the pale on my antipathy to this book. In simplest terms I didn\'t connect with this work at all and I would be best to chalk this up to a ""reader/writer"" mismatch and move on but I will try and articulate some of my reading experience.Some of my perplexity withNormal Peopleis that I just couldn\'t relate to the twenty something, highly educated, politically aware and cynical young adults that populate this novel. I am not sure how reflective these voices are of young Irish making their way in the world, but as presented here I found them exasperating to listen to and not particularly nuanced.It is possible that even if I didn\'t enjoy the novel I might like the writing but in actual fact Rooney\'s style is perhaps the single biggest thing that bugged me. I found some passages of interest sandwiched between a lot of wooden dialogue and these flat descriptions ...Marianne goes inside and comes back out again with another bottle of sparkling wine, and one bottle of red. Niall starts unwrapping the wire on the first bottle and Marianne hands Connell a corkscrew. Peggy starts clearing people\'s plates. Connell unpeels the foil from the top of a bottle as Jamie leans over and says something to Marianne. He sinks the screw into the cork and twists it downwards. Peggy takes his plate away and stacks it with the othersThis kind of writing really gives me nothing.Others have cited the two dimensional nature of her secondary characters and I would concur. Barely any of them made much of an impression on me. Alan - Marianne\'s brother, seemed particularly badly drawn. He appears to be a key part of understanding Marianne and yet he warrants only a few pen-strokes of unexplained malice and cruelty. The opening of a wine-bottle and pouring of cups of tea receives much more page space.I tried to understand Marianne, who seems to be both ugly and beautiful, popular and friendless. Her hinted at troubled family life was suppose to underpin her need to be a submissive. I remain unconvinced that this is really how dominance and submission works and I would think experts in BDSM might strongly take issue with some of the cliches here.The relationship between Marianne and Connell should have kept this book afloat at the very least. The intense emotional and physical connection, the will they / won\'t they stay together, all the drama of YA love is here but it is in an eye-wateringly navel-gazing form. I found it all exactingly po-faced. The number of inexplicable break-ups, largely based on mis-communication was about three or four break-ups too many for me. I just wanted to yell at this novel most of the time. Say what you mean and stop being so insufferably difficult !, either split up or stay together, both your friends and I really don\'t care !. Marianne and Connell were of most interest to me when they started emailing each other, discussing novels and politics thus preventing them breaking up over some new emotional minutiae. Perhaps this should have been a novel of their email exchanges.Oh well, I guess I will never be a Rooney fan and I have doubtless missed the point of this book entirely but that is ok not every book is for every reader.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Normal Peoplestarts out beautifully. Marianne is a loner in high school with no friends, while Connell is the popular football player. His mom works as a cleaner at Marianne's house, so they run into each other when he stops by to pick up his mom. Over time, they start to thaw around each other, growing closer as they realize that they can be their true selves when they are together.Rooney captures so well the vulnerability and awkwardness of teenage years, along with its exuberance and infinite possibility. It was sweet to follow along to Marianne and Cornell's developing relationship. Even though there is the stress of school and the pressure of being teenagers, when they are alone together, they can be free to express themselves and be who they really are.Then they are off to college, and the dynamics change. Marianne becomes the popular one, and Connell becomes the loner with no friends. At this point, I start to realize Rooney captures a very black and white version of high school and college. You are either part of the popular obnoxious crowd or you are a nobody with no friends, and there is nothing in between. And everyone's ultimate goal was to be in the popular crowd. But that isn't the school experience I remember, so it became harder and harder for me to connect with this book. In my experience, people had several different groups of friends, and no one liked obnoxious people. Most were working so hard that they didn't have time to worry about popularity and how others regarded them, especially in college.This story has a very YA feel to it, where the characters are filled with angst and lack emotional maturity. While that made sense when Marianne and Connell were in high school, as the story progressed through their college years, it didn't anymore. The two seem to love each other, and yet, they are so sensitive to perceived slights that innocent conversations would quickly escalate to a breakup. Honest communication would clear this up immediately, but they don't do that. Instead, they circle and prod each other until they are back together again. Then the cycle repeats. It's all very dramatic, but it left me pretty apathetic by the end of the book.This book also tackles the subject of abuse, but I think it was a missed opportunity here. Rooney portrays abuse as if some people just want to be abused, so they will let anyone abuse them, and even go around looking for it until they find it. That's not right. Victims have trouble escaping because abusers are often the people they love most, who treat them well most of the time and express regret after an incident. But there is no love or good treatment in this book, so it doesn't make sense that the victim would just put up with it.In the end, I thought the first half of this book was wonderful, but everything stagnated in the second half. The main characters never really grew up, so they repeated the same mistakes over and over again. Their lack of maturity and insight into themselves and their relationships grated on me.

Ugh.Save yourself and your time, go read something else.#ThankMeLater'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Wow! Check out Hulu’s marvelous adaptation! They did amazing job by adapting this lyrical, poignant, sad and realistic story with remarkable, heartfelt performances! It is a real soul crusher, heartbreaker! Get ready to set your ugly cries free!!!!This really reminded me of those tear jerkers, Oh God I cannot breathe, all my happiness swept away by emotional vampires vacuum cleaners inc., come on, that’s kind of nerve bending story that one of the protagonist has to die from a deadly disease ( or both of them needed to die sometimes! Oh no another crying torrent coming up! I cannot hold it! I can’t)or one of them has to commit suicide kind of, depressive, sad, exhausting, giving you anxiety attacks kind of John Green books. (After looking for Alaska, I felt the a dark cloud always following me for one month and my husband fed me with soap and Chardonnay, as you can imagine I couldn’t eat solid food at least two months because I bit the pages of the book and chewed so hard, destroyed my dental implements!!!)So yes this book is sad, horrifyingly bringing your dark clouds and vultures above your head and interesting fact is nobody dies! But yes there are so many heavy, harsh, heart wrenching, brain cell boiling issues make you feel like hit by a truck several times, then suffered from waterboarding and torture conducted by American Psycho’s Patrick Bateman and finally thrown away into the swamp,eaten by crocodiles. The characters deal with drug addiction, bullying, sexual assault, suicidal thoughts, severe depression and it is really heartbreaking to see them not to have a regular teenager lives.And you know what after all those torturous feelings, my kindest part of soul( also my masochist brain cells and my vulnerable heart) loved those two characters, Connell and Marianne and witnessed their literally growing up, their adolescence and early adulthood times, forming friendship, special- sensitive bound. At first when they were in high school, Marianne is outcast, social pariah, bullied by mean girls as Connell is shiny, popular star of the school community. The part he didn’t take her to the prom was harsh, mean move and Connell lost his all his brownie points and earned slapping contest championship’s high rated asshole statue.But when they were in college, the balances were changed now Marianne is intellectual, independent, smart social queen and Connell loses his spotlight and sentenced to be an ordinary, invisible college boy which makes him more depressed and lonely.Their friends-lovers- again friends- again lovers kind of complex relationship and their story’s revelation should be called : “Restrained screams” or “Unsaid Words” , or “Bottled Up Emotions!” or “I think I’m really pissed off those two characters so much for breaking my heart !”I know the realistic conclusion was necessary, logical, reasonable but it doesn’t mean it is not hurting you so much!As a result, if you can deal with feeling blue by reading sad, sad, sad, OH GOD WHY THE HELL I CARED SO MUCH ABOUT THOSE CHARACTERS kind of book, this is just for you.I liked the captivating, realistic, poignant story telling and I truly accepted those broken, flawed, complex characters but I think sometimes their story made me suffocated a little.

Never have I read a young-adult romance book that feels so realistic to what happens in real life sometimes. It\'s not always boy meets girl and they live happily together with hardly any issues. This book has depth and complexity, which sometimes is lacking in romance books. The interactions and conversations that Rooney writes about feels so real and true. I loved how she touches on real issues that young adults experience as they enter a new era of life (college). While reading I kept wondering.. ""Will they even end up together?"" Both Connel and Marianne (the main characters) are exploring new intimate and sexual relationships outside of their own. This is a compelling modern love story, one that deserves all of the attention it gets.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I thought I’d do the Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge, even though it’s just about winter here in Sherwood. But I think I’ll get away with it, you never see any police around here from one year to the next. Anyway, standards really aren’t what they were, I don’t even think anyone would care. In the old days if you did a summer reading challenge in winter you’d be out the door so fast your feet wouldn’t touch the ground. But these days people have neck tattoos and name their children after brands of paint remover so you can get away with anything.When I looked at the categories of the reading challenge I had to ditch a couple – “Read a Goodreads Choice Winner” was one – I mean, sorry Goodreads, not to eat the hand that feeds you and all but those Choice Awards are not my cup of tea at all. Fortunately the other categories fit neatly on to several stubborn denizens of my real life to be read shelves, so off I go.The category I’m doing here is “Read a ‘most read’ book” so I consulted the list and I found a copy of one of these popular works in my local Oxfam, andNormal Peopleit is.NOT THAT NORMALThis turned out to be a kind of romance but at least it was the unromantic modern version, where we follow a couple from school (she’s rich and unpopular, he’s working class and beloved by all) to university (where it’s the other way round suddenly) and during this long peregrination they’re on-and-off shagging and loving and BFFing and pinging from one thing to the other like pinballs whilst at the same time recoiling in horror from acknowledging the plain fact that they’re made for each other, so they attempt and fail to have actual real boy/girlfriends and the real boy/girlfriends have no idea what’s really going on so this golden couple of Marianne and Connell have a permanent status of IT’S COMPLICATED.They have angst in their pangst.The short version of all that is to say thatNormal Peopleis the unfunny updated version ofWhen Harry Met Sallyor that it’s like if Ross and Rachel had absolutely no sense of humour or any charm at all and were all strictly gloomsville I-am-suffering because life is suffering, woe is us, woe is all of us.THE MASOCHISM TANGOIn the middle of this wall to wall fraughtness and gnashing of laptops we get to find out that the lovely Marianne has a masochistic streak. When she’s not with Connell she likes her boyfriends to beat her up.I think it’s now possible to construct a rough and ready scale of female masochism using novels I happen to have read or movies seen. Here are seven female protagonists rated out of ten on the masochism scaleAnastasia Steele in Fifty Shades of Grey...………………………….3Eileen Dunlop in Eileen......................................................…….4Lee Holloway in Secretary...………………...…………………………...6Marianne Sheridan in Normal People...…………………………….7Nora in Topping from Below\t......……………………......…...……….8Erika Kohut in The Piano Teacher...……………………......………..9O in Story of O...…...…………………………...…………………………….10O is the gold standard of female masochism. I can’t see O ever being beaten.THE WATER FROM THE TAP GOT WARMERThe soundtrack toNormal PeopleI think would be a jarring mixture of Kraftwerk, Leonard Cohen and late Billie Holliday, when her voice was all hoarse and ruined. WhatNormal Peopledoes is to describe at length a hot mess of a relationship in cool, affectless sentences, some of which go way too far with their cool and affectlessnessThe outside door closes and Marianne re-enters the kitchen. She rinses her water glass and leaves it upside down on the draining board.Many pages laterThe water from the tap got warmer and Marianne put the plug in the sink and squeezed a little dish soap onto a sponge.And many pages laterMarianne drank a single cup of black coffee and ordered a croissant which she didn’t finish. Connell had a large ham-and-cheese omelette with two slices of buttered toast, and tea with milk in it.Meanwhile, our tall handsome working class star student Connell suffers from a book-length inarticulacy that is distressing to witness. He’s all “that was weird”, “I don’t know”, “I’ll have to think about it”, “Kind of” and “That was weird”.As regards the plot, there’s not much to see here, it’s really just beads on a string. One thing - I had a problem with Marianne’s family, only a mother and a brother, but they both seem to hate her, for reasons never explained. I mean, give us a hint, Sally. Just a little hint. But you know what, I read this in two big gulps, it was weirdly compelling, similar to another much beloved and not that great campus novelThe Secret History. So that’s something. I read many novels that I find extremely putdownable and unpickupable. This was not one of those.SO, DID YOU LIKE IT?It’s complicated.2.5 stars.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '‘Life offers up these moments of joy despite everything.’The directions our lives take are often shaped by those around us, particularly actions made out of love. Normal People, the second novel by the acclaimed writer Sally Rooney, is a moving narrative of the steps and missteps of young love as two people grow into themselves in a troubled world of class divide and social pressures. The book follows Connell and Marriane from their first days as secret lovers in high school through their tumultuous friendship--often sexual--at Trinity College, Dublin. Normal People is at its best when addressing the social issues of class, which she brilliantly uses sex as a medium to elaborate on the power dynamics and dehumanizations of capitalism. While there are a few problematic moments regarding Marianne’s preference towards submission that seems to disregard her autonomy in her own sexuality and assume that the preference is the hallmark of being “damaged”, Rooney manages to very accurately describe modern love in a way that expresses the complexities in all their untidy beauty, as well as the social posturing and emotions of college years. Through using sex as a navigational device across society and told in a sparse, matter-of-fact style that doesn’t impose an authorial judgement over the events in favor of acknowledging the reader’s ability in being able to decode for themselves, Normal People is a success that is nearly impossible to put down.Great news, Rooney more that lives up to the hype. The press releases marketed Irish writer Sally Rooney as the “first great millennial novelist”--a fairly eye-rolling label clearly intended to hit nerves and spark conversation in what also seems a constant attempt from the gatekeepers of older generations to minimize or infantilize the millennial generation--and her name has achieved pop-culture accolades recalling Elena Ferrante from a few years ago. Even Taylor Swift recently came out of the woods to recommend Rooney’s first novel,Conversations with Friends. Speaking of eye-rolling marketing, Conversations was hailed as the “Salinger of the Snapchat Generation,” which seems like something impossible to proclaim unironically. In all this misguided and lazy-label hype that seems half intent on wishing for her downfall, Rooney is an utter delight to read and Normal People is a wonderful achievement. If she is a ""Salinger of Snapchat""? That is up to you to decide (personally I hate that label too much to make a judgement call), but isNormal Peoplean original and insightful accomplishment? Definitely.Normal People begins with Connell and Marianne in high school as what seems like caricatures of themselves. If initially their characters feel a touch cliche, it is because we are all a bit of a cliche at that age. Connell is the smart, athletic type concerned how others think on him whereas Marianne is an outcast who is considered strange for daring to be an intellectual woman and not caring what others think of her (okay, maybe it is alittleoverly cliche, but bear with me here). After a secret relationship--Connell being concerned his friends will know they are sleeping together in a way that is outright abusive--they part ways only to reunite at Trinity College where now Connell is the quiet outsider and Marianne the center of attention. A turning of the tables he deserves as in high school he had a sense his social status made him too good for her and he deeply hurt her because of it as ‘his attraction to her felt terrifying, like an oncoming train, and he threw her under it’. The novel launches from here into many turnings-of-the-table, complicated friendships and near-misses, with each seemingly caught in each others gravity no matter what they do or who they are with.‘It\'s funny the decisions you make because you like someone, he says, and then your whole life is different. I think we\'re at that weird age where life can change a lot from small decisions.’It is truly moving seeing the ways a person’s trajectory in life can be so shaped by those around them. Being set at the start of this decade, the artifacts of the era--such as a scene discussing economic policy while listening to the first Vampire Weekend album--were deeply nostalgic for me and reminded me what life was like in the age of the characters. While some might decry them as overdramatic or bold representations of themselves, remembering who you were at the age of 19 and all the social posturing of that period is a good way to really appreciate how well Rooney captures the age frame of her characters. The social dynamics of a college campus are really well done. Marianne, for example, is honestly interested and invested in social justice and politics, but a girlfriend of Connell’s assumes her discussions about it at parties as a grab for attention. Connell, on the other hand, is very well read but doesn’t name drop books the way others do and is suspected of being uncultured and dumb by Marianne’s male make-a-show-of-being-cultured friends (you know the type: the guy that will tell you information about Ian Curtis without you asking, corrects someone’s pronunciation of Sarte, and casually leaves work-in-progress art lying around but acts annoyed if you comment on it, as a friend recently put it).He did gradually start to wonder why all their classroom discussions were so abstract and lacking in textual detail, and eventually he realised that most people were not actually doing the reading. They were coming into college every day to have heated debates about books they had not read.The society at the Uni is very much indicative of social class, Connell at one point telling his therapist he has actually witnessed students argue over which of their father’s make more money. Being a working class outsider, or a ‘culchie’ as the slang goes, he observes that many of the excessively rich students like the notoriety of intelligence more than actually having tobeintelligent.It was culture as class performance, literature fetishised for its ability to take educated people on false emotional journeys, so that they might afterwards feel superior to the uneducated people whose emotional journeys they liked to read about.It becomes an act of superiority to state you’ve read a book or have a stern opinion on a political topic, which, actually having a working knowledge of these and caring about them does give Marianne an easy “in” with this culture and luckily Rooney spares the reader an impression of C & M as authentic and the rest as Salinger “phoneys”. It’s implied, but handled well.While Rooney occasionally dips into caricatures of college-types for minor characters, her primary characters are nuanced and complex in a way that, by the end of the book, you feel you shared your time with real people. Both Marianne and Connell are problematic at times--especially Connell and his sexual hangups or his impressions of Marianne as “damaged”--but Rooney invests emotional insights into them that grants them a real sense of authenticity. Unlike the first person narration ofConversations,Normal Peopleis told from a very unaffected third-person omniscient perspective that refrains from making judgements on the characters. You see their faults and their inner-justifications or griefs but the reader is left on their own to decide what to make of them. There are times when either character will disgust or frustrate you, and others when you really feel for them. Like life, nothing caught in a social web is simple. As the novel progresses, so does the insight into their emotional well-being, which reaches a climax of sorts when Connell is having suicidal thoughts and Marianne feels insignificant in the world. Luckily, Rooney handles these topics with grace that captures the feelings of depression without glorifying them or using them merely as a plot device. Similarly is Marianne’s homelife, with a now-dead abusive father, an all-but-absent mother and a weak yet abusive older brother who takes out his anger on her. The way these elements shape a person is done quite well--aside from some of Rooney’s presentation of sexual dominance to be discussed shortly--and the impact that people have on each other’s growth and identity is shown as both a sadness and a joy throughout the novel.‘That’s money, the substance that makes the world real. There’s something so corrupt and sexy about it.’It is easy to get invested in the non-relationship of Marianne and Connell, which really pulls the novel forward through authentic raw emotion, but what really makes the novel work is the ways their relationship, and sex, becomes an avenue to examine power dynamics. What is particularly interesting about Marianne and Connell are their particular social classes and how these shape the way they interact with their world.He and Marianne never talked about money. They had never talked, for example, about the fact that her mother paid his mother money to scrub their floors and hang their laundry, or about the fact that this money circulated indirectly to Connell, who spent it, as often as not, on Marianne.While the two rarely discuss money, the influences of late capitalism are very much a part of their identities. Marianne stays on in Dublin and never has to work whereas Connell spends his weekends back home working in a garage and he is looked down upon at Trinity by his peers due to his working class status. It even causes a “breakup” between him and Marianne after their first year when his pride in not asking her to stay at her place since he cannot afford rent is seen by her as him wanting to go home to see other people and disguising it as not having the money to stay in Dublin for the summer. To her the idea of simply not being able to pay rent seems like an aberration from reality. When they are both awarded a scholarship, Connell is irked that for him it is a necessity to fund school but for Marianne it is just a status symbol (and her being awarded the money means a student who actually needed it was denied the money). It is then pointed out to Connell that he is accepting being served dinner at the award ceremony by his own working class peers, essentially throwing guilt back at him as a working-class traitor. This is a typical knee-jerk reaction of a dominant class, repositioning guilt to create in-fighting within the subordinate classes as the dominant class continues on unimpeded.Guilt manifests itself in many ways throughout the novel. Self-doubt and shame enter into many of the characters in the later portion of the novel and there is even a suicide of a character Connell remembers most as someone who built their personality out of trying to be accepted by others. The social posturing and societal guilt that drives it becomes toxic at a point. Most pronounced is Marianne’s self-guilt and the ways her history of trauma still keeps her in it’s grasp:Denise decided a long time ago that it is acceptable for men to use aggression towards Marianne as a way of expressing themselves. As a child, Marianne resisted, but now she simply detaches, as if it isn\'t of any interest to her, which in a way it isn\'t. Denise considers this a symptom of her daughter\'s frigid and unlovable personality. She believes Marianne lacks \'warmth\', by which she means the ability to beg for love from people who hate her.Central to the novel are the sexual growth and identities of Marianne, which Rooney has pegged as a deviant, and Connell who is motivated by privacy, shame and supposed normalcy. Connell views sex as a very private act--he is very flustered when Peggy suggests a threesome with Marianne and Connell--and forces his and Marianne’s relationship to be secret in fear of other’s thinking him abnormal for being with her. He is bothered by her desires for submission and thinks of himself as better than being able to go along with them. As sex is often a metaphor for capitalism in the book, Connell is attempting to be “ethical”, but it is also an issue that he consistently views her prior history and sexuality as constituting abnormality and being “damaged” (as he often puts it). There is a sense of the classic Catholic guilt at play and his revulsion towards her wishes to be hit puts a wedge between them.‘Is the world such an evil place, that love should be indistinguishable from the basest and most abusive forms of violence?’Marianne, as mentioned earlier, tends towards a more devil-may-care attitude towards sex and has a preference for being abused. A major criticism of the book are the ways that submissive preference and being damaged are overly entangled. Using sex as a critique of capitalism, the submissive behavior and those who eagerly dominate over her is an insightful examination of power dynamics, but I do concede the argument that it minimizes the possibility of an aggressive sexual relationship founded on love and mutual understanding instead of only being an avenue for abuse and actual sadists like all the examples in the novel. Moving on. Under capitalism, the female body is inevitably commodified and her dominators tend to see her more as an object to control rather than an equal partner. Her boyfriends are all abusers of power: the first is hosting a fascist to speak on campus, the second is the son of a banker central to causing the economic collapse in Ireland (he also tells stories about his friends working in the US banking industry as if the housing bubble collapse is funny anecdote), and the third is an artist who enjoys photographing torture. It is best stated when the Swedish artist coerces Marianne into being tied up more, ignoring her pleas to stop by telling her he knows she’ll do it because she loves him and he loves her. She wonders ‘Could he really do the gruesome things he does to her and believe at the same time he’s acting out of love?’The need to possess her and abuse her is mirrored in the social class aspects of the novel. While the likely-sociopathic Jamie does not physically abuse her outside of bed, his emotional abuse is far worse--much like the way the wealthy class gaslights the lower classes into remaining submissive. Unfortunately, Rooney’s answer to the sexual questions raised by the book are a bit of a let-down compromise that gives masculinity unnecessary applause. At two pivotal moments in the book, Connell stands up to an abuser--one in high school when she is groped and the other at the end when her nose has been broken--by swooping in through a display of being more masculine than the abuser. It feels overly traditional, much like the sexual roles, in a novel that would be better served by pushing limits. The sexual compromise of the two at the end, with Marianne basically submitting to his love and masculinity, feels like a cop-out for an ending that is already far too tidy than it need be.Despite this, the novel registers as a success overall. Rooney leaves the novel on a note of uncertainty, a similar tone that fueled the infectious nature of the novel, which makes up for the overly tidy emotional climax and resolution. It seems inevitable that there will be a miniseries of this with Ed Sheeran\'s Castles on the Hill blasting over a montage of Connell and Marianne--this idea almost makes me want to drop a star, though I won\'t--and while this work is imperfect it achieves what it sets out to do and I very much enjoyed reading it. I couldn\'t put it down to be honest. These characters are easy to care for, the story is engrossing and the undercurrents of themes and social criticisms are well executed. This novel is a serious dose of early romance nostalgia that doesn’t sugar coat anything. The imperfections and complexities of love and identity are what makes this novel function at its best and I will be eagerly awaiting her next book.4.5/5Her eyes fill up with tears again and she closes them. Even in memory she will find this moment unbearably intense, and she\'s aware of this now, while it\'s happening. She has never believed herself fit to be loved by any person. But now she has a new life, of which this is the first moment, and even after many years have passed she will still think: Yes, that was it, the beginning of my life.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I had been influenced by a friend - whom I adore & respect - by her 1 star review.... way before this book started gaining momentum and hit the stores a month ago.This book wasn’t for my friend - but it sure was for me.I’ve own an ‘Advance Reader’s Edition’, of Sally Rooney’s paper copy for a year and a half. It sat on my shelf, unread.Rooney’s first novel “Conversations With Friends”, was wonderful.I admit having a thing for the type of writer Sally Rooney is:*Addicting* thought-provoking reading for me. “Normal People” is contemporary - romantic-tragic - comic - fresh - psychologically sharp - emotional - and very perceptive.Rooney leaves me lingering in her characters. They are flawed and frustrated.I ‘felt’ flawed and frustrated reading it! At times I wanted to scream at the characters - other times my heart just broke.I knew I wanted to read this novel. I even knew it would most likely drive me into my head. ( it did).I’m not sure why I didn’t open it last year.The book-cover alone has that ‘curl-up-and-get- sucked-in- feeling’, to it.And that’s exactly what happened.I COULD NOT STOP READING. ‘Addicted’!I will never doubt my own gut desire again when it comes to a Sally Rooney novel.I’m a fan here to stay.Totally love what she creates.SOMETHING HAS SHIFTED IN ME, too, with respect to romance novels. I can no longer say...“Oh, I don’t read romance novels”... It depends...Heck, “Crime and Punishment”, had romance. Loaded with power and cruelty... but still some romance.“East of Eden”, by John Steinbeck was filled with juicy romance...( destructive force)... but still...lust and romance was present.Helen Hoang’s book, “The Kiss Quotient”, more modern, had romance written all over it. I loved it, too.Laugh at me if you wish...but in the same way that I got hooked on the two main characters, ( Tessa and Hardin), in Anna Todd’s “After Series”.....( also a young author like Sally Rooney)....I was hooked on the relationship’ between Connell and Marianne in “Normal People”.I’m sure that Rooney would not turn this book into a series… but if she did, I’d read it.The electricity and entanglement between this Connell and Marianne - was soooo complex. I wanted to join their conversations about their families—about the way each felt about themselves, and each other.... and all the things that were happening to them.When I finished the last page, my mind continued swimming in thoughts.Most, I was sad to leave them.Soooo many fabulous sentences - page after page. Gorgeous reflective and intimate writing.Sally Rooney is an ‘it’ author for me.LOVED IT!!!! ....Ha... if you can’t tell.I’ll end with one expert:“All these years they’ve been like two little plants sharing the same pot of soil, growing around one another, contorting to make room, taking certain unlikely positions”.'}]"

i went into this book blindly and had no idea what to expect with this story, and to say, im so glad i did bc i was pleasantly astounded by what unfolded.. the hype surrounding this book is very much justified. this was an enchanting story, i just adored watching roman and iris find love through a magical connection. their love was so tender and emotionally raw.➷ this story weaves an enthralling tale of war and the blossoming romance intertwined within its turmoil. divine rivals unfolds within the world war I-esque setting, a raging war happening between two gods who are using humans as their troops to cause devastation. there are elements of trench warfare and the overall impacts of the loss through war. the descriptions were realistic and brutal.➷ the letters are no doubt the best part of this book, they were so intimate and i simply can’t get over them. the writing in each letter just had so much raw honesty and an undercurrent of longing. you could feel their emotions pour out of each letter!! they formed a connection through loss and grief and sought solace in one another through letters. rebecca ross has the most beautiful, poetic writing style ever, she is an expert in lyrical prose, it completely enchanted me—i absolutely adore the way she delicately crafts her words, it was so exquisitely beautiful.“if there’s anything i can should say in this moment when my heart is beating wildly in my chest and i would beg you to come and tame it—is this: your letters have been a light for me to follow. your words? a sublime feast that fed me on days when i was starving. i love you iris.”➳ this story follows iris winnow, an ambitious journalist who dropped out of school after her brother went off to war to fight for the goddess enva and she does her best to care for her alcoholic mother — she gets a job at a local, prestigious newspaper writing obituaries to earn money to pay the bills. after a devastating incident happens, iris packs up her life, leaves oath and travels 600km away to the front lines of the war to find her missing brother. she gets a job as a war correspondent and uncovers the harsh truths on the devastating war that is occurring. this is where the story truly comes alive as it explores the experience of trench warfare.iris is well-crafted character who is the easiest character to root for!! her vulnerability and struggles with abandonment and fear of never being good enough were tangible. she is very strong-willed, compassionate and empathetic — i adored how she always goes out of her way to help others were in need, befriends them and listens to what they have to say. she’s faced many challenges but she is still very earnest.➳ roman, charming and witty and the polar opposite to iris. he comes from a wealthy family and is much more privileged compared to iris but he wants to make his own way in life. but omggg i want this man for myself. the way he abandoned his family obligations and followed iris into the war zone bc he couldn’t bear the thought of being without her?! the way he loves iris so deeply and shows up for her every single time?? when he was in immense pain and couldn’t walk so he crawled just so he could reach her.. now that broke my heart into tiny lil pieces!!

Why did y'all not warn me 😭😭Did I love it?Absolutely with my whole heart.Was it perfect or flawed?It was absolutely perfect. I wouldn't change a thing.Does it end on a brutal cliffhanger?A BIG FAT YES. Am gonna be crying for days.In a slump after Fourth Wing?Grab this book.THIS IS YOUR SIGN TO BUY IT. IT IS WORTH THE MONEYYYYYYY'all can probably tell how much I loved this book. The people are not lying, this is worth the hype.✔️ Read if you like Shadow and Bone✔️ Historical fantasy romance✔️ Rivals to lovers✔️ Pen palsIris (FMC)andRoman (MMC)have been working and competing for the position of a columnist alongside each other at the local newspaper. There's no denying that there's spark between the two but can they overcome the rivalry as the war of gods loom over. Amidst the brutal war and magical creatures, finding solace in letters, in each other's company seems to fill them with hope and something more.Theworld buildingis not too complex, it might seem that way in the beginning but the author sets the stage brilliantly. Never info dumping, she paces the history of the towns, the platoons, the creatures and the gods-Enva and Dacrebeautifully. The typewriters sure are an interesting feature. It came so naturally and was so easy to read, love when authors do it right. Thepacingis consistent, not too fast not too slow. I was so mesmerized by her writing, the story and the characters, I was envisioning it all and didn't know where the time went.One of the underrated things is the way the author dealt with heavy topics-war, grief and loss of lifeplay a big part in this book. So if any of the things feel uncomfortable, do reconsider as it is a very emotional book. The way it's depicted and the sheer raw emotion written wasbeautifully heartbreaking to read.There were side characters who were just there for a few pages but they made me cry. They made an impact. The words they carried were powerful.Thecharactersmade this story so amazing.💠Iris-She is such an interesting and lovable FMC. Although she is just 18 but there's so much maturity to her. The way we see her struggles, battling emotions and presenting a tough exterior for her brother, for her mother and whoever close to her- is commendable. The way she is ready to protect others and put others first is beautiful to see.✒️Roman-I loved him from page 1 itself. A 19 year old with zeal. A bit grumpy in the beginning but there are reasons for that. The way he was dead set on doing anything and everything for Iris 🤌 The way he was never shy to show love. The way he was never held Iris back. The way he fell for her ❤️\u200d🔥 He is full of charms and wit and ready to be with Iris no matter what.Need me a Roman 😭His story about Del made me sob NGL.Thesupporting charactersare a nice addition to Iris and Roman's and the gods story. I likedAttiea lot and am sure I will love Lilac too. I likedMarisoland her 'mom energy' andKeegantoo however short a while we see her for.Forestis sure an interesting character and I won't elaborate on it further due to spoilers. Y'all but I really want to seeSarahachieve her dream 😭Theromancewas PERFECT 🤌 It's so deliciously sweet and swoon worthy, I fell in love with their love. The chemistry is present right from the beginning. I loved how both of them are so into each other and especially Roman, who is never afraid to show it. The sweet spicy moment in a YA book was beautiful to read. I loved how their relationship developed and grew stronger and stronger.Theendingabsolutely broke me. I knew something would go wrong but had no idea of the intensity of it. It was such a brutal cliffhanger and with the epilogue, am crying again just by thinking about it.I cannot recommend it enough y'all. Easily one of the best books I read this year. It's definitely going to be one of my favourites ever and I already cannot wait to reread it. Books like these make me realise why I love reading so much 🥺❤️ I honestly want to protect and cherish my copy of it.HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDGuys, just trust me.~•~•~LET'S GOOO 🙌🤞~•~•~Eep my copy just arrived and it is so beautiful. Cannot wait to get to it, have high hopes""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""How did the promise of a war between gods turn into a middling historical fiction with a lackluster romance and nary a whiff of fantasy? I'm honestly a bit stunned.I went intoDivine Rivalswith high expectations. I'd seen the gushing reviews and the deluge of 5-star ratings. And I'd gotten a taste for romantasy and I wanted more. In fact, I was so certain I was going to love this that I saved it for just the right moment when I'd need a little extra zing in my reading repertoire.So I settled myself in, ready to be swept away in a fantasy of epic proportions, with an enemies-to-lovers romance for the ages. And how can it not be amazing, with gods at war and two rivaling journalists who don't fight with their swords but with their words. Yes! Except no, because this didn't really deliver on any of it.Instead, what I got was more or less a historical fiction. The fantasy element is so diminutive, I felt like I could blink and miss it. You see, the gods were unhappy with each other, and they're recruiting humans to fight in their war. And that's pretty much it for the fantasy part. Oh, and there's some magic in old houses and typewriters. You can see how that would be disappointing for a reader expecting, well, more than that.The majority of the story is told from Iris's perspective and she never really gelled into an interesting character for me. At every step, she does what you would expect a character to do, nothing more, nothing less. Her brother is fighting in the war, so she misses him. She sees an opportunity to join the war effort, so she does. There's a cute boy at the office, so she's attracted to him. But there's another nice boy she writes with, so she's attracted to him too. At no point did she surprise me in any way. I found Roman to be the more compelling character, but his perspective is only a little bit here and there.As for the romance, it was serviceable but ultimately uninspiring. There was no real chemistry, no banter, no spark, nothing that made me swoon or crack a smile. The majority of it played out via Iris and Roman's letters to each other, and they felt distinctly YA. The writing was deep in the way of teenagers, but much ado about nothing for old folks like me. In fact, it reminded me of AOL chat logs from back in the day. I wonder if I were to dig up my own from my teenage days, it would come up similarly bland and overwrought.That isn't to say I didn't enjoy any of it because I did. But I kept waiting for that moment when the words I'm reading on the page would turn into an immersive experience, and it never did. Every element in here—the war, the fantasy, the characters, their writing, the romance—was pleasant enough to while away a few hours, but in that take it or leave it kind of way.No one's more disappointed than me. Compared to what I had imagined in my head, this story paled in comparison. But to be fair, part of that was my fault. What I wanted and what I got were complete opposites. I'm a huge fan of romance and fantasy, which this isn't really, and not a fan of wartime historical fiction, which is all this is.For all my complaints, I did get some enjoyment out of it. And since it's a duology and I already own the second book, I'll go ahead and finish the series. Fingers crossed that the second book has more of the exciting elements I'm looking for.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

I’m tired of having to rearrange my life after the people within it depart, as if I’m a puzzle and I’m now missing pieces and I will never feel that pure sense of completion again.”iris:incredible protagonist. the way she thinks, acts and speaks is so amazing, and her love for people she cares about is so so beautiful. also she is incredibly mature, the way she takes care of her drunk mother and works to keep them alive is so heartbreaking. she wears an armor everyday, hiding her family’s poverty, never asking for reassurance even though she feels alone in the world and trying to stand up on her own feet by working her ass of for a job she wants so passionately is so admirable. her seeking the truth at all costs, staying strong while her mom’s showing reckless actions, putting her family above her, not needing anyone and defending herself by her own, knowing her value, wanting to be beautiful just for herself, telling herself she doesn’t needs her mother’s reassurance but gets bolstered when gets it, not crying in front of people, hating when her boss made her resignation sounds like she is giving up, remembering small details about her friends, afraid to love people because she always lose them.. if i see someone saying she is unlikable, watch under your bed bc i’m hiding there.. with a knife 🔪”But if I’ve learned anything from those fools, it is that to be vulnerable is a strength that most of us fear. It takes courage to let down your armor, to welcome people to see you as you are. Sometimes I feel the same as you: I can’t risk having people behold me as I truly am. But there’s also a small voice in the back of my mind, a voice that tells me, ‘You will miss so much by being so guarded.”her mind is spectacular, she talks about how much she was hungry, not just for food but for sober conversations with her mother. and the way she uses words; she ‘bled’ herself in her articles and letters, not having motivation and describing the blank page as ‘nothing more than stars and smoke and word pressed on a page’, her writing to roman but also writingfor herself, her understanding how close she can be to people, yet how far away and lonely she can fell.. she is so mature and i get chills every time we get a scope of her articles and letters.“I don’t think you realize how strong you are, because sometimes strength isn’t swords and steel and fire, as we are so often made to believe.

What I do have to say is that it never bored me.

How one little thing like typing a letter can open a door you never saw. A transcendent connection. A divine threshold.” ✨This truly was such agemof a book.I can’t get over it.Divine rivals couldn’t be any more true to its name as here you have two journalist rivals — Iris and Roman. Both of them find themselves competing for a coveted spot at the newspaper they work at and of course Iris finds her rival infuriating to be around yet handsome but she fails to realize the connection brewing between them.Two enchanted typewriters that are linked, both characters in the midst of an ever growing mystical war among gods, shared grief in their losses, and a divine unbreakable connection that even Roman believes to be true“I think there is a magical link between you and me.” A bond that not even distance can break.”that is what you can expect from thisNow on to what I loved about the characters:Iris and Romans rivals to lovers build up was done as well as could be even if I wanted more . I was relishing in how annoyed he made her and their banter along with the love and vulnerability each shared with each other esp in those letters — letters that only one of them knew who was on the other end and that made it all the more intriguing to see unravelThe letters held such vulnerability yet strength written in them, it was everythingg to read each. Even more when they started signing off their letters as“—Iris and —CtoLove, Iris and Your Kitt”💌I loved loved loved their admiration for each others work and hyping each other up — more so Roman when it came to Iris herself and her words.“Your letters have been a light for me to follow. Your words? A sublime feast that fed me on days when I was starving.”My Iris,"" he said, ""there is no question that you are the brave one, all on your own.""I absolutely loved and adored Iris’ character sm. One of my favorite fmcs. Rebecca’s way of portraying her was amazing to see unfold and develop. The tone for her dialogue felt so wise, mature and strong willed. I felt the need to protect her and let her know she wasn’t alone even though she felt that way. But she didn’t need that bc she was self sufficient all on her own“But I realize that people are just people, and they carry their own set of fears, dreams, desires, pains, and mistakes. I can’t expect someone else to make me feel complete; I must find it on my own.”She exemplified such strength, bravery, selflessness and determination despite the loneliness and hardships she experienced. I felt like I connected with her and saw her in myself (we love the relatability) and all the way through I was rootingg for her“Get a grip on yourself, she thought, hands on her knees, eyes closed. This is war. This is what you signed up for. Don’t look away from it.”Roman was just so kind, so soft with her, so infuriatingly handsome (in my head), mine and everyone else’s book husband as of now, and so selfless as he dropped everything to follow her! as if I didn’t already love him and he goes and does that while also protecting her with his life. **Roman really made it difficult for me to enjoy a romance when it comes to my expectations in how a man speaks tomethe fmc in a book 😩 I legit melted every time he’d say her name (I imagine it’s soft)“Iris,” he whispered.”soo much whispering but I get why“You and I … we need to stay together. We’re better this way.”“I think you and I are simply better together, Kitt.”I loved the addition of the small found family she found in Marisol and Attie. It warmed my heart to know she had this as she really deserved to have itShe realized this was her family now. That there were bonds that ran deeper than blood.”There were minimal fantasy elements in this but the story on its own was amazing to not to care sm for it. But I have hope the inclusion of the gods is expanded upon further in the next book esp as their characters felt more like an introduction to them in this———————————————Ultimately, this was written so impeccable with such a compelling plot and I was in complete awe because of it. The romance wasexquisite, as was the characterization and the connection between them in their trauma and grief endured. The war aspect was also written in great detail as well with the angst of it depicted for how it truly is and what it’s like.I’m gonna need the next book asap as I have so many questions than answers in what happens next after that cliffhanger??Thank you emara for putting me on to this <33Quotes I loved:“I am coming to love him, in two different ways. Face to face, and word to word.”“The way you show up, day after day, even when you are weary or afraid or simply uncertain. That is strength, and I see it in you.”“Little flower,” I see it now. The name suits you.P.S. Hi, Iris.”“Kissing him in the dark was entirely different from kissing him in the light.”“I can’t risk having people behold me as I truly am. But there\'s also a small voice in the back of my mind, a voice that tell me, You will miss so much by being so guarded”“I rarely share this part of my life with others, but I want to tell it to you now. A piece of armour, because I trust you. A glint of falling steel, because I feel safe with you.”“Roman Cheeky Kitt. Roman Cantankerous Kitt. Roman Conceited Kitt.”“I want to know everything about you, Iris. I want to know your hopes and your dreams. I want to know what irritates you and what makes you smile and what makes you laugh and what you long for most in this world.”“He began to see the invisible threads that drew him to Iris. It didn\'t feel like fate; Roman didn\'t quite believe in such fancies. But it certainly felt like something. Something that was now stealing his sleep and making his chest ache with each breath”“Your grief will never fully fade; it will always be with you — a shadow you carry in your soul — but it will become fainter as your life becomes brighter. You will learn to live outside of it again, as impossible as that may sound”'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '""What the hell are you doing here, Kitt?""she demanded, shoving his chest.""Have you lost your mind?""She felt his hands slide down her back, resting on the curve of her hips.

The sweet romance? The story? Was it the fact that, despite not being part of the age group this was targeted at, I saw myself in both the main characters and could relate to their personal arc, both individually and as a couple?I have no idea, but if I had to try a guess, I\'d say it\'s simply a combination of all these things, plus the fact that Rebecca Ross is a crazy talented author.I\'ve had the chance to discover her just recently, after reading a book that\'d been on my tbr since 2017, and I\'m glad to conclude she\'s gotten even better with time and experience.Divine Rivals is abook I recommend going into blindly and one I definitely can\'t see anyone savoring slowly. Once you get into it, stopping is as hard as breathing under water.Rooting for the main characters to find themselves will become a new hobby, but rooting for them to find happiness by finding each other, will become an obsession.The progression from rivals to lovers is so smooth, almost soothing in its naturality.The setting is atmospheric, described so perfectly you can almost smell the stinging scent of gunpowder, hear the crinkle of the paper and the click of Iris and Roman\'s writing machine\'s keys.I don\'t know why, but while reading it, I couldn\'t stop thinking of one of my favorite movies,Un long dimanche de fiançailles. They have really similar vibes and not because they both take place during a war and tell the story of two very unfortunate lovers, but also because of the gray-ish undertones, the raw portrayal of reality, and the bittersweet romance.I like to consider myself pretty experienced when it comes to the reading scene, but those last pages made me feel like I was on a literal rollercoaster, even though I kind of saw it all coming.I didn\'t expect the pain to be so powerful, probably. It wasn\'t until the end that I realized just how invested I am in the magical realism of this story and the delicious pain that comes with this romance.Speaking of romance. I\'m at a loss of words for how perfect it plainly was.These two simply can\'t not be together. THEY CAN\'T.Roman is adorable, a real gentleman and the most cinnamon roll to ever roll, but for me, Iris stole the show. I admire her so much and my heart cried for how strong and brave she always was, despite everything she had to endure.I can\'t wait for the sequel to come out, even tho, I\'ll admit, I am also a little scared of what will and could happen in it.I hope that, if Rebecca Ross eventually decides to break my heart with Ruthless Vows, she wrecks it neatly so that it\'ll have the strenght to heal properly.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'world building ? don’t know her'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'alexa, play the great war by taylor swift.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""”their names would be entwined—roman and iris or winnow and kitt because could you truly have one without the other?”i fell in love with this book the moment i saw it and reading it made me fall even harder. the beauty of this book is unreal.”a piece of armor, because i trust you. a glint of falling steel, because i feel safe with you.”this book had such beautiful writing. the descriptive imagery had me so easily immersed in the story. it felt like i was a part of the book. the magic fascinated me. and most importantly: i adored roman and iris. they are one of my most special couples.one thing i did not expect going into this experience was for it to make me as emotional as it did. i had tears in my eyes during many chapters. the words on the pages spoke to me. i connected with these characters so much more than i thought i would.“i think about how effortless it is to lose oneself in words, and yet also find who you are.”my favourite part has to be the letters between roman and iris. anyone that knows me knows that letters make me go weak in the knees. reading their exchanges really touched and warmed my heart. there’s something about writing your deepest thoughts and feelings without any eyes on you, and knowing the person on the other side isn’t judging you, that you are not alone. the letters gave us so much insight into roman & iris. we really get to feel their emotions with them, and a lot of it is so relatable.iris winnow-”i’m not afraid to be alone, but i’m tired of being the one left behind. i’m tired of having to rearrange my life after the people within it depart, as if i’m a puzzle and i’m now missing pieces and i will never feel that pure sense of completion again.”she is honestly such a lovely character. i think anyone can see themselves in iris. her emotions and life experiences are very relatable. one of the things i love so much about her is that she’s not afraid to take risks. with her life or her heart. she puts herself out there and she’s ready to accept whatever the consequences are. she doesn’t shy away from anything. and roman is right, she is brave and strong. she went through so much in this book and she is still fighting. she is still surviving. she’s very inspiring.roman kitt-”i don't think you realize how strong you are, because sometimes strength isn't swords and steel and fire, as we are so often made to believe. sometimes it's found in quiet, gentle places.”now where do i find me one? im being so deadass. anyways i need him. he’s a little more apprehensive to open up, but when he does you really see he’s the biggest softie on the inside. the way he would drop anything for her, he would die for her, he lives and breathes iris winnow. he rereads her letters every night. he constantly uplifts her. he knows exactly what she needs at any given moment and its so sweet. iris says jump he asks how high?! he would actually do anything for her and i love that for my best girl.”i think there is a magical link between you and me. a bond that not even distance can break.”i love how when we get each of their povs, they always mention how much they love the others’ laugh and how much joy it brings them. its so small but its always the little things that stick with me and win my heart.“you will miss so much by being so guarded.”i loved this book but i do have to say the world building and the description of the gods was definitely lacking. but the characters themselves don’t even seem to understand their world or why they’re at war so i guess i shouldn’t really expect too much from that. maybe in book 2?also, i felt a disconnect between iris / attie / marisol. i was not picking up what they were putting down. i see that they formed some sort of bond during such a stressful time, but when iris was calling them “home” and her “found family” i was like what? is the found family in the room with us? did i miss a couple chapters because yall were giving roomates at best. there was more telling than showing in that aspect if im being honest.anyways i just know when i think back on this book its always gonna be beautiful memories because what will stick with me is how much i adored the writing and irisroman together. ♡”you are worthy of love. you are worthy to feel joy right now, even in the darkness.”""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '♾/5 ☆“you are worthy of love. You are worthy to feel joy right now, even in the darkness. And just in case you’re wondering… I’m not going anywhere, unless you tell me to leave, and even then, we might need to negotiate.”I honestly didn\'t know what to expect going into this book. I went into it knowing that it is listed as a YA fantasy but didn\'t expect to fall in love with it this much! I had seen so many good things about this, but the reviews just don\'t do it justice. This has become one of my favorite reads for this year!Divine Rivals is the first book in the Letters of Enchantment duet. This is my first book by Rebecca Ross, and I fell in love with it from the very first word, which surprised me since I usually don\'t enjoy third person. Her writing is so beautiful and poetic that it just captured me. Though this is a fantasy, there are some missing pieces to the world building, but as I was reading, I completely overlooked it due to the romance that was present. It\'s a slow burn, work place academic rivals to lovers, where he falls first and harder this always makes me swoon so hard, romantacy that is emotional with angst, tension, grief, death and so much pain that I hadn\'t been expecting.Iris Winnow and Roman Kitt are two young rival journalists. They work at the same newspaper the Oath Gazette and find themselves competing for the same columnist position. While the rivalry between them grows, so does a war that is between the two gods, Dacre and Enva. The two find solace within each other through two magical typewrites that are linked through their letters. Iris begins sharing her daily thoughts and her deepest griefs, and he does in return.""Sometimes I’m afraid to love other people. Everyone I care about eventually leaves me, whether it’s death or war or simply because they don’t want me.""""I realize that people are just people, and they carry their own set of fears, dreams, desires, pains, and mistakes. I can’t expect someone else to make me feel complete; I must find it on my own.""Iris Winnowis so strong, brave, and just precious and needs to be protected at all costs. I absolutely adore this woman. She\'s so mature for her young age and has so much to deal with in her everyday struggles, but she doesn\'t let it affect the way she carries herself and cares for others. I was so happy that she found her own family since all the people she\'s loved have left her in one way or another.\xa0 I just want to wrap my arms around her and give her the biggest hug.""But just in case you were wondering… I’ll gladly read whatever you write.""“You mentioned the other day that you think I’m only here to ‘outshine’ you. But that’s the furthest thing from the truth. I broke my engagement, quit my job, and traveled six hundred kilometers into war- torn land to be with you, Iris.”Roman C. Kittis grumpy and stubborn in the beginning, but when the layers start to peel back and we are left with the sweetest, kindest, gentleman that I swear you will ever meet. He had me absolutely swooning. His life seems so perfect from the outside, but he has so many struggles that make me love him even more. I won\'t go into detail as I want you to fall in love with him as I did. He goes through great lengths for Iris to show how much she means to him and cares for her. I mean, he stands outside her door and waits for her to lock it before he leaves. He raises the bar for real men, and I\'ve just added a new book boyfriend to the long list.""He didn’t want to live in a world without her and her words.""""She couldn’t bear to live in a world without him.""""“I think you and I are simply better together, Kitt,”""Their names would be entwined—Roman and Iris or Winnow and Kitt because could you truly have one without the other?""RomanIrisare the definition of soulmates. Their chemistry is so palpable from the very beginning, even as they were still rivals. Iris gave Roman the following nicknames Roman Cheeky Kitt. Roman Cantankerous Kitt. Roman Conceited Kitt and I loved them all. They had me giggling and kicking my feet. The way that he would do anything for her and the love he has for her words had me on my knees swooning. Their love for each other was felt through every moment on the pages. And the letters they wrote to each other are everything and so much more! They were making up some of my favorite parts. I need someone to write me love letters NOW!Side charactersI absolutely adored the love and found family that Marisol, Attie, and Keegan shared with Iris. They are the family that Iris never knew she would need. The way that they became close knit so quickly and will always look out for and do anything for one another is so precious. Now Iris\' mother Aster and her brother Forest I\'m not sure how I feel about them. They both did things that I couldn\'t fully agree with. I\'m hoping for some redemption from Forest for what he did in the next book.""It’s odd, how quickly life can change, isn’t it? How one little thing like typing a letter can open a door you never saw. A transcendent connection. A divine threshold.""That cliffhanger has me feeling so much. I was not expecting that ending at all.

Someone you trust. You remove a piece of armor for them; you let the light stream in, even if it makes you wince. Perhaps that is how you learn to be soft yet strong, even in fear and uncertainty. One person, one piece of steel.""“I don’t want to wake up when I’m seventy- four only to realize I haven’t lived.”""I don’t think you realize how strong you are, because sometimes strength isn’t swords and steel and fire, as we are so often made to believe. Sometimes it’s found in quiet, gentle places. The way you hold someone’s hand as they grieve. The way you listen to others. The way you show up, day after day, even when you are weary or afraid or simply uncertain.""She unfortunately had to sit on Roman Kitt’s lap, nearly all the way to the front lines.~~Oh, how I would gladly take her place...“I prefer salty over sweet. I prefer sunsets over sunrises, but only because I love to watch the constellations begin to burn. My favorite season is autumn, because my mum and I both believed that’s the only time when magic can be tasted in the air. I am a devout tea lover and can drink my weight in it.”“I have the worst sweet tooth imaginable,” Roman began. “I prefer sunrises, but only because I like the possibilities a new dawn brings. My favorite season is spring, because baseball returns. I prefer coffee, although I’ll drink whatever is placed in front of me.”""It’s not a crime to feel joy, even when things seem hopeless. Iris, look at me. You deserve all the happiness in the world. And I intend to see that you have it.”“I think we all wear armor. I think those who don’t are fools, risking the pain of being wounded by the sharp edges of the world, over and over again.""“I pray that my days will be long at your side.

I wholly, truly and irrevocably fell in love with these two andtheir love.They areso so so preciousand I love them with my whole heart.“He didn’t answer, but his gaze held hers, and she thought she saw something flicker through him, like a star falling from the cosmos, or a coin underwater, reflecting the sun.

I mean how could I not whenRebecca\'s writing is this beautiful and exquisitethat I have no words to describe it. She just became one of my favourite authors with this book only. I loved the wayRebecca dealt with heavy topics like grief, loss of loved ones to war, healing and everything.The characters were well written that I could feel every emotion they felt.The connection between the main characters and side characterswas amazing. I liked Attie and Marisol and they both were amazing side characters.“I realize that people are just people, and they carry their own set of fears, dreams, desires, pains, and mistakes. I can’t expect someone else to make me feel complete; I must find it on my own.”It hasRivals to Loverswith""She is glaring at him but he is grinning at her.""trope. I mean its essential if its a rivals to lovers book.You know whats better than a book written in third pov?A well-written book in third pov and Rebecca just proved it.And I need more of Roman\'s povs but mostly I need the scene in his pov where Iris had to sit in his lap for 3 hours while they were travelling 🤭“She was glaring at him now. That fire in her eyes could have brought him to his knees.”The fantasy and the world building about the gods in their world was a bit underdeveloped.It was more about people and their fears related to war and how they fought and survived. Their world divided in two parts- Dacre\' s followers and those who were called upon by the goddess Enva to fight her wars. There was a little story mentioned about Dacre and Enva\'s feud and also the other gods but I wanted to know more about Dacre and Enva\'s story and exactly what happened between them that led to this war. And I still don\'t understand that why Enva was not their fighting in the war like Dacre was doing that. But I\'m also hoping we get all the answers in the sequel.➸ Iris WinnowI love this girl.She is so archer coded 🏹I loved reading her povs the most and as much as her inner monologues were painful they were also so damn relatable. She\'s been through the worst but I admire her for her strength, her kindness and resilience. She\'s just 18 but she\'s so mature and brave and I liked we saw her growth throughout the book. I saw her struggles and how she grew out of them and always found a way to be there for others and her family. I was also happy that she now has her own found family. Even if she lost everything she got a job as a war correspondent because she wanted to see her brother. She isone of the best FMCs\'I\'ve had a chance to read about this year.“I rarely share this part of my life with others, but I want to tell it to you now. A piece of armor, because I trust you. A glint of falling steel, because I feel safe with you.”➸ Roman Carver KittYes I\'m obsessed withRoman Cheeky Kittor was itRoman Cantankerous KittorRoman Conceited Kitt?!Whatever it was I just love this man so much. He is such a sweetheart and perfect in every way. He was a bit grumpy in the start but that was also hot.He\'s just 19 and well mannered and he waited for Iris to lock her door.I mean no real man would ever do this and its the basic thing everyone should know about. He is intelligent, charming and also witty. Where do I find him because I wanna marry him!! The way he fell for Iris and then took care for her whenever he could and the way he shared his story and his secrets with her even though he was a bit reticent to share them at first. I loved it.“Your letters have been a light for me to follow. Your words? A sublime feast that fed me on days when I was starving. I love you, Iris.”╰┈➤ Their relationshipThey had been working and competing against each other for the same position but they always had this spark between them and this undeniable chemistry.The rivals to lovers wasn\'t there muchbecause they were already attracted towards each other but I loved that they still bickered and bantered even after felling in love with each other. Roman brings out the fire in Iris and he protected her with his life everytime.“Going easy on me, then?” He arched a brow. “That’s surprising. We’re supposed to duel to the death.”“Has anyone ever told you that you squint when you lie?” His scowl only deepened.“No, but only because no one has spent as much time looking at me as you do, Winnow.”The letters they shared, the secrets and pain they wrote about in those letters, the way they let their armor fall one by one to be vulnerable with each other, the way they earned each others\' trust, the way Roman followed her to the war sight to be with her, their morning runs, the way they fell in love with each other, the way their loved grew stronger and stronger everyday. It was just mesmerisingly beautiful.They truly are ✨️SOULMATES✨️“I broke my engagement, quit my job, and traveled six hundred kilometers into war-torn land to be with you, Iris.”Their love was just so sweet and wholesome and aching and even the war couldn\'t taint it.Did everything between them was rushed after they fell in love?Yes.Did I mind it?Absolutely Not.Because it was war time and they didn\'t even knew if they had a chance to see each other next morning, so they did what they could do and it was perfect and reasonable. They can\'t just wait for the war to be over or be adults in their early 20s to get married when they already saw the brutal reality of war and what it could do to people.“You and I … we need to stay together. We’re better this way.”“I am coming to love him, in two different ways. Face to face, and word to word.”The ending completely shattered my heart in pieces.Why would Rebecca did this to me. They just found their happiness after so much pain and trauma and Rebecca just ripped it away from them and left them with so many regrets and pain. Iris couldn\'t even tell him how much she loved him and that asshole brother of her didn\'t even tried to save Roman?? I hate Forest and I don\'t believe a word he said and Rebecca better give us a happy ending for them in book 2 or I\'ll riot 🤺— Some other beautiful quotes —➸ “It takes courage to let down your armor, to welcome people to see you as you are. Sometimes I feel the same as you: I can’t risk having people behold me as I truly am. But there’s also a small voice in the back of my mind, a voice that tells me, “You will miss so much by being so guarded.”➸ “I am so afraid. And yet how I long to be vulnerable and brave when it comes to my own heart.”➸ “There are good days and there are difficult days. Your grief will never fully fade; it will always be with you— a shadow you carry in your soul— but it will become fainter as your life becomes brighter. You will learn to live outside of it again , as impossible as that may sound.”➸ “I don’t want to wake up when I’m seventy-four only to realize I haven’t lived.”➸ “Kissing him in the dark was entirely different from kissing him in the light. When the sun had gilded them hours ago, they had been eager and clumsy and hungry. But now, in the shadows of night, they were languid and thorough and curious.”➸ “I think about how effortless it is to lose oneself in words, and yet also find who you are.”To my emotional buddy read partner Rae 🫂 thankyou for hearing all my ramblings and screaming in our dm. You are the best and I can\'t wait to read another heartbreaking book with you.———————————————————————————Rae and I are definitely alergic to books with happy endings 😃 so here we are again to fall in love with this book just to let it break our hearts in the end.Br with my most beautiful girl Raerae 💗'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'DNF at 57%. I feel like I’ve read a completely different book to everyone else?I went in with high expectations due to the hype but ended up being disappointed. A great concept but it was poorly done.The lack of world building made me feel disconnected from the entire story.The characters lacked depth and the dialogue was cringy, especially the letters 😖The plot stumbled along, and the central war element was majorly underdeveloped. There was no suspense whatsoever from what you’d expect whilst living through a war.I just don’t get it 😞'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""This book had such a strong start. I was so intrigued by the mythology that for the first time maybe ever I really didn't care much about the romance. The middle of the book took me quite a bit of time to get through, but the end picked back up in a way that has me excited to read the sequel. I hope that the next book deals more with the myths and gods etc. Overall I'd say the plot was much stronger than the romance, which I didn't find myself particularly invested in.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Reread 25/12/2023:I stand by everything I said last time and more.

I\'m going to savour it as much as I can because I don\'t want their story to end...⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆First read review 22/11/2023:★5 stars""He didn\'t want to live in a world without her and her words"";“She couldn\'t bear to live in a world without him""Probably the most surprised I\'ve been with how I felt about a book after reading it. I went into this book without really knowing what it was about, other than that it\'s a YA fantasy and super popular. What I wasn\'t expecting was howbeautifullywell written this book is. This book made me feel like I was wrapped in a warm blanket and Rebecca Ross\'s words gave me a big hug the whole time.To me, the concept of this book felt like it was a mix ofThe Hating Game, Beach Read and the Book Thiefwith elements of a dystopian fantasy.★The plot★This book follows Iris and Kitt who are both reporters working together and competing for the position of columnist at a newspaper called the Oath Gazette. This book is set in a historical period and a war between the gods Dacre and Enva is escalating and getting close to their homes in Oath. Iris is less fortunate and is experiencing hardship while Kitt initially appears to be a well educated, high society pretty boy with a sense of entitlement. The twist? Both Iris and Kitt have magical typewriters that send letters to each other and Iris doesn\'t know who the recipient is.╰⪼ThoughtsI was tossing up giving this book between 4 and 5 stars. Overall, I think the plot was probably 4 stars. I found it incredibly interesting and a unique take on a fantasy book intertwined with a historical fiction/romance. For a fantasy book, some people might find the world building wasn\'t massively present but I personally didn’t think it needed to be as it wasn\'t the main focus of this book. This book was received exactly the way it was intended to and was so much more than just another fantasy or romance book. The writing was a masterpiece and pushed this book to 5 stars for me.I loved that Rebecca didn\'t try to overwhelm the characters with a heroism or saviour complex concerning the war like most fantasy books would have done. By making Iris and Kitt correspondents you experienced the war and its effects through a raw lens. This book speaks to larger social issues, the importance of appreciating what you have, processing grief and shows the characters strength and resilience. Most importantly, this book showcasesthe power of words.The letterswere my favourite part about this entire book, you just have to read them for yourself to appreciate this.★Iris Winnow★Iris Enchanting Winnow, Iris Ethereal Winnow, Iris Exquisite Winnow, Iris Elizabeth Winnow.Ohh Iris I just wanted to give her a big hug the whole time. This poor girl went through so much at just 18 years old and was so emotionally mature. She had a lot of insecurity and had a hard time believing anyone could love her or do something kind for her without thinking they were making fun of her. She was so strong and compartmentalised her feelings to help others and do what needed to be done without question but she also had the ability to be so open to Kitt about her struggles and feelings. Her vulnerability when she had every reason not to be was so refreshing.""I am so afraid. And yet I long to be vulnerable and brave when it comes to my own heart.""★Roman Kitt★Roman Condescending Kit, Roman Upperclass Kit, Roman Confounded Kit, Roman Competitive Kit, Roman Chaffing Kit, Roman Cheeky Kit, Roman Cantankerous Kit, Roman Conceited Kitt and Roman Carver Kit 😭💗Again, Kitt was so emotionally mature for a 19 year old. His upbringing might have looked better than Iris\'s on the outside but he was battling an internal war with himself over the grief of his sister\'s death and his father\'s suffocating expectations of him. I loved that he fell first and his initial actions just reiterated how much she meant to him - that her words were hisinvisible stringholding him together. I loved watching his facade slowly crumble around him throughout this book, it was written so well.He followed her to war 😭 and the best part? He didn\'t go to convince her to go home or to sideline her. He just went to be with her because he couldn\'t stand to be away from her. He understood the importance of what they were doing and despite the risks, he didn\'t want to take anything away from her, just support her.""Iris! Iris, it\'s me, Kitt.""(sobbing) 🥹🎶I kept listing tothis is me trying, invisible string and tis the damn seasonby Taylor Swift while reading this and they just fit so well for Kitt and Iris🎶QuotesI honestly could keep rambling on about this and it\'s starting to feel like an open love letter but I\'ll leave you some of my favourite quotes:➸ “I’m tired of having to rearrange my life after the people within it depart, as if I’m a puzzle and I’m now missing pieces and I will never feel that pure sense of completion again.”➸ ""An then when you nabbed the first assignment and I read your article... I realised you were far more than I imagined.

Something fierce and vulnerable and very unexpected.""➸ ""While he had always been moved by her words to Forest, he realised that he felt pierced by all the words she had written for him. They made him ache.""➸""He began to see the invisible threads that drew him to Iris. It didn\'t feel like fate; Roman didn\'t quite believe in such fantasies. But it certainly felt like something. Something that was now stealing his sleep and making his chest ache with each breath.""➸ “I don’t think you realise how strong you are, because sometimes strength isn’t swords and steel and fire, as we are so often made to believe. Sometimes it’s found in quiet, gentle places.”➸ “The way you show up, day after day, even when you are weary or afraid or simply uncertain. That is strength, and I see it in you.”➸ “I rarely share this part of my life with others, but I want to tell it to you now. A piece of armour, because I trust you. A glint of falling steel, because I feel safe with you.”➸ ""If she wasn\'t so exhausted and stiff from the harrowing encounter they had miraculously survived, she would have knocked away his touch. She would have slapped him. She might have kissed him.""➸ ""What is a synonym for sublime? Transcendent. Divine."" 😫➸ “I want to know everything about you, Iris. I want to know your hopes and your dreams. I want to know what irritates you and what makes you smile and what makes you laugh and what you long for most in this world.”➸ ""A transcendent connection, a divine threshold.

By day, she’s an adjunct professor, toiling away at grading labs and teaching thermodynamics in the hopes of landing tenure. By other day, Elsie makes up for her non-existent paycheck by offering her services as a fake girlfriend, tapping into her expertly honed people pleasing skills to embody whichever version of herself the client needs.Honestly, it’s a pretty sweet gig—until her carefully constructed Elsie-verse comes crashing down. Because Jack Smith, the annoyingly attractive and broody older brother of her favorite client, turns out to be the cold-hearted experimental physicist who ruined her mentor’s career and undermined the reputation of theorists everywhere. And that same Jack who now sits on the hiring committee at MIT, right between Elsie and her dream job.Elsie is prepared for an all-out war of scholarly sabotage but…those long, penetrating looks? Not having to be anything other than her true self when she’s with him? Will falling into an experimentalist’s orbit finally tempt her to put her most guarded theories on love into practice?","[{'rating': 4, 'content': 'edit:the word \'big\' in relation to jack was mentioned 12 times which is 11 times too oftenBefore I even think about starting this review I need you to know two words:lesbiansandSTEMDo I have your attention now? I should hope so because those two words are going to blow your fucking mind.i need you all to know and advocate forGeorge and Dorato get thier own romance book written by Ali herself,they are the most iconic people ever. George (Georgina) is a awesome physics women in stem and Dora makes souvolaki, people who know how to make suvolaki are next level cool. Nothing can change my mind.AND George is friends with Bee from Love on the Brain,HELLO Bee and Levi cameo.We can have a STEM Cinematic Universe where the character are all friends in some way. That would be epic. But im getting carried away.We need to advocate for a queer queens to get therelesbian women in stem romance.I NEED THIS IN MY LIFE no you dont understand its not a want, but a needSo, with that out of the way onto what you are actually here for, my thoughts on the books. And imma tell you right now that they are messy. Like toddler painting kinda messy.Sograb your popcorn, take a seat in front of the fire and let\'s get ready to RUMBLLEEEE*at this point imagine two boxers in a fighting ring, both representing my differing opinions*Okay so first lets not start with the positive because pshhh that soooo boring so lets start with what I found similar to the other two books which is an overarching theme in the Ali Hazelwood Cinematic Universe.Honestly, it\'s not as similar as i thought it would be (referancing my previous review down bellow)butwith that said there were still a heap ton of tropes and similarities to her other books.Lets have a chat about aroace chat and the spectrum hmn. I have noticed ali includes this in almost all of her novels. It was included inThe Love Hypothesisand god forbid we mention that sex scene inUnder One Roofit still remains with me no matter how much i try to purge it from my brain. And now im this book, now i am no expert when it comes to aroace rep but i feel like she always goes with the: ‘ive never wanted to have sex i dont know whats wrong with me’ line and that is so wrong.Now, there is one word that i cannot get behind and that is the use of the word “Daddy” I hate it so much. And i sould not be reading the word ‘daddy’ in a science romance book! It is simply unnacpetable and Iwill notstand for it. It was used inLove on the Brainand now this book. It will stop with this book. You hear me Ali Hazelwood?From me to you, we can both agree that miscommunication and down to earthstupidityis something we both wholeheartedly hate right? Yes well, funny you should agree because in this book and inLove on the Brainthe male love interest very patently tells them: “I DO NOT hate you I AM NOT WHO I WAS ALL THOSE YEARS AGO” somehow the amazingly smart and illtellegent women in stem still think these men hate them after literallythree whole freeking pagesof him telling her he doesnt and how he felt the entire trajectory of their relationship (from meeting to current) and i swear to you all the girls brain power must be directed towards academic because the havenone, nada, ZEROemotional intellegence EVEN AFTER BEING TOLD STRAIGHT TO THERE FACEWoah, this really rubbed me the wrong way, because it happened in TWO BOOKS and the guy is always so patient and nice. If i was in the situation god knows what I would do. Screw their heads on straight probably. They definatly need it.We all know that Ali Hazelwoodlovesto tell us every.single.page that the love interest is big and tall and ginormous and takes up all space. Granted she still did it here but toned it downa lotmy personal favourites were:“like how could i miss him when hes standing next to Adam Carlson. Theyre the Mount Rushmore of STEM academia”“He is……well, he is big. And well muscled, very well muscled”And saving the best for last:“His giant paws tightened around me”Think about that for a while won’t you?Lets talk about what I liked hmn? Why don’t you refil your popcorn and water you’ll be needing it.So, the thing I loved the most is that I had fun. I had so much fun reading the physics jokes and the story as a whole. The writing was so much better than her previous books. Praise the lord that they both had a personality and we got to know stuff about them (i didnt even know Adam was an evolutionary biologist until this book(how freaking cool is that as a job? OgkjdfjefbdhbdhjskI would kill to talk to someone with his knowlege and intelligence) like that\'s how little we got told about Adam) but in this book we got Jack\'s job upbringing and morals. It was good to have a more layered story than usual and still have fun. Usually Ali throws tropes into a mixing bowl and hopes for a delicious cake but thankfully it was a flowy story and that was not the case. InThe Love Hypothesisthere was trope after trope, as if to make readers happy and it did but gosh there was a lot jam packed in there.George was my favouite character of this entire book. She\'s my idol in life. She has many publications in physics, is super cool and has a wife that can make souvlaki. Now if you cant tell i really live Dora and George and i need their story now. I am deeply in love with both of them.I loved Elsies character development from extreme people pleaser(coming from a people pleaser) to her own person. It was so fun to see, especially with Jack helping her and calling her bullshit out.My most favourite thing of all was ofc the cameo from Adam and Olive and the friend group with all the cool science people.thatin my opinion was the best part of the bookand that\'s why we need a george and Dora book so we can have more of thatNow that all the boring stuff is out of the way let\'s get into what I didnt like because this is the real juicy stuffIhatedthe main characters actual name: Jonathan, but only because thats name of a close relative of mine and it\'s weird to read a romance with their name in itAnd that name? Jack Smith? I still stand by my clain that that sounds like the most old white man that throws money at stuff to make it go away guy. Honestly add some spice, some paprika, lemon peper, cinnamon to make it taste better on the tongue.I got the scene, that as a millennial Ali was trying to be ‘hip’ and be ‘down wid it’ as the first few chapters really showed meIn the very first chapter we got told her favourite movie was Twilight (pop culture reference is not good, we dont like that) and honestly her professor should have failed him because she liked twilight. I strongly dislike that movie and so personally i agree with the proffesor. there i said it. and yk what idc if its wrong.I think Ali is trying to live through her characters, I can see her personality come through her books and not in a good way. She includes ‘quirks’ because women in stem have to be unique and quirky. (as a woman in stem i can tell you i\'m not. I read, study, and listen to Taylor Swift. So not very quirky at all) There was a quote she put in that made me feel like Ali was justifying her opinions:”Not that there would be anything wrong: sex work is legitamite work, and people that engage in it are just as deserving of respect as ballerinas, or firefighters or hedge fund managers”I mean she\'s not wrong, but we didnt need to include it in a romance novel did we? So that\'s now my biggest problem, that she includes her own shit into romance novels. but i guess thats how i perceve it. Like social issues in books i dislike because i want a whole different world without all the shit that happens in this book.NB: Riddle me this: miss people pleaser can\'t tell her best friend her favourite movie was twilight but can tell her client???Okayyyy, I think I\'m done, now get up and stretch your legs, it\'s been a long read. Go to the wharepaku (toilet) and i will leave you with this:we need lesbian women in stem romance book, george and Dora are right there Ali, USE THEM.....{About this review below, yes it was insensitive for me to write a review before I read a book, but it was my opinion from reading the blurb so I am not sorry I did it}{this review is based off the synopsis i have not been given an arc}I asked and Miss Hazelwood did not deliver.This book looks like an exact carbon copy of Love on the Brain and The Love Hypothesis mashed together""Rival physicistscollide in a vortex ofacademic feuds and fake dating shenanigansin this delightfully STEMinist romcom""Sound familiar??In The Love Hypothesis Adam and Olive fake datedIn Love on the Brain Levi and Bee were rivals in collage""By day, she’s an adjunct professor, toiling away at grading labs and teaching thermodynamics in the hopes of landing tenure. By other day, Elsie makes up for her non-existent paycheck by offering her services as a fake girlfriend""Again InLove on the BrainBee was a scientist by day and a social media STEM infulence by night. Seems like all her characters have two \'personas\'Jack Smith,the annoyingly attractive and broodyolder brother of her favorite client, turns out to be thecold-hearted experimental physicist who ruined her mentor’s career and undermined the reputation of theorists everywhereagain, sounds familiar??In The Love Hypothesis Adam was known for turning people thesis down because \'they wernt good enough\' he was known as cold hearted and scary.In Love on the Brain, Bee thought Levi ruined her career.Also what kind of simple ass name is Jack Smith, please choose something more interesting for flavour.Elsie is prepared for an all-out war of scholarly sabotage but…those long, penetrating looks? Not having to be anything other than her true self when she’s with him? Will falling into an experimentalist’s orbit finally tempt her to put her most guarded theories on love into practice?I bet you that this book will be that the girl finds out how soft and sweet he is under that scary persona and he\'ll only be nice to herEven the covers look the sameI rest my casethank you for coming to my TED talkp.s i will still be reading this because well women in stem what am i to do? already not enough around so despite my hypothesis (get ittt) i will still be reading and lets hope that I am dead wrong.........................this looks like every other Ali Hazelwood book ESPECIALLY THE LOVE HYPOTHESIS IT LOOKS THE EXACT SAMEBut at least he doesn’t have black hair right?

And she\'s returned with my all-time favorite trope: enemies to lovers!I can honestly say this is my favorite book of hers because it\'s funnier, sexier, and quirkier! Did I mention that Jack Smith is the best book boyfriend she\'s ever created? That sulking, intense, intelligent man knows how to make a girl happy! He\'s passionate, but he perfectly controls himself to put Elsie\'s needs first. He\'s caring, patient, and gentle. I loved him!Let me introduce you to dear Elsie, who deserves ten thousand hugs. She has a Ph.D. in theoretical physics. When she couldn\'t get an academic position, she resorted to fake-dating to pay off her student loans. Even though she still lives in a crappy apartment with her bestie Cece, she remains hopeful that she\'ll find a better position in the near future. She still manages to keep her head above water as an adjunct professor, teaching five different classes, grading labs, and reading her students\' very sincere emails (those emails made my week! I laughed too hard!). Meanwhile, her mother forces her to become a negotiator to solve her big brothers\' extra immature problems they\'ve gotten themselves into!Elsie\'s weakness is that she doesn\'t know the meaning of ""no""! She can never say the word! She molds herself into a different character for each person in her life, putting their needs first. That\'s why she never thinks about what she really wants from the universe!Then, her path crosses with her nemesis. She finds out that Jack Smith, the brooding but charismatic brother of her best fake-dating customer Greg, is the same person who wrote an article that ruined her mentor\'s career! Unfortunately, he\'s also the man who\'s in charge of the physics department at MIT and one of the decision-makers who will decide if she\'s the right candidate for her dream job. Jack supports another candidate for the job and is shocked to find out that Elsie is not the librarian girlfriend of her brother, as he was led to believe. As an experimental theorist, he has every intention of rejecting to work with a theorist!Elsie has no intention of giving up her dream job without a fight. She\'s determined to fight against the man who gets under her skin. Yes, she finds him very attractive. Yes, she wants to rip his clothes off and kiss him senseless, then punch him in the face. But she can restrain her feelings to be professional, right? Oh, you already know the answer!Overall, Elsie and Jack were dynamite! I loved their dialogues, hilarious banters, and blazing chemistry! This is my favorite work of the author! I wish I could give it more than five stars!Special thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing this amazing digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest opinions.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology:medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '""You could be my entire world. If you let me.""""I think I will.""So conflicted thoughts.. It\'s not a bad rating, I did enjoy it but there were things which could have been better.✔️ Enemies to lovers✔️ STEM romance✔️ She is dating his brother (in a way)✔��� Witty banter✔️ Slow burn✔️ Twilight references (lots of them)✔️ Adam and Olive cameoFirstly, let me start by saying this one wasso much better than Love on the Brain.I hated that one so much.*sigh*Or maybe it\'s the fact that it\'s been long since I read The Love Hypothesis that this was enjoyable. Although,there are few similarities to TLH but it\'s not overbearing.Like Adam and Olive, and unlike Bee and Levi Elsie and Jack are unique and true to themselves. But if you are looking for them to recreate the same magic as in TLH, you will be disappointed. Cause the two here, are quite forgettable and bland.Elsie,is not a bad FMC, she is quite relatable in some places and such a pushover in others that it gets a bit frustrating. However she stays true to her personality- being a people pleaser. I did like how she was able to be her true self around Jack.Jackis not like Adam and that\'s simply put. Don\'t get me wrong, he is nice, kind and respectful but he is also boring. I like that he\'s paying attention to details, calling Elsie out on her bs, and always so open to her but there\'s no firepower in him. He\'s just there.""I have these elaborate daydreams that Im feeding you a five course meal I hunted, field dressed and prepare all by myself.""Coming to theromance,it was okay-ish. I enjoyed some of their moments together. I LOVED the Twilight references. I enjoyed the first half when Jack was trying to figure Elsie out, especially when she was involved with Greg. But the two had very little heat. It was not angsty.The slow burn was too slow. The spice was not spice, it was just salt and pepper.The fact that the two kept talking and talking and talking and talking and talking while trying to figure out where to put his fingers and dick in..it was too late. Look, I appreciate he wants to be sure she wants it but how many times does she have to repeat herself 😭😭 Also the fact she kept pushing him for sex after knowing how clear he made it that he wants things slow- 🚩🚩 In my opinion,I would prefer that Ali Hazelwood writes a clean romance rather than whatever tf she thinks is smut.I really loved the Adam and Olive cameo, even for a short while they radiated power, chemistry and all things good.

No one can possibly be this much of a doormat, can they?Elsie is slaving away as an adjunct professor teaching too many classes to make ends meet. She supplements her meager earnings by being a fake girlfriend, putting her people-pleasing tendencies to good use. When a chance at her dream job arises, the only thing standing in her way is Jack, the annoying older brother of someone she\'s fake-dating, who also happens to be on her interview committee. But do they really hate each other or is it more like they secretly have the hots for each other? Ha!I really enjoyed the first half of this story. It starts strong with all of the hallmarks I love from Ali Hazelwood—snark, banter, science, smart female in STEM, and puns. I was breezing through it, smiling and chuckling to myself on pretty much every sentence. No one does funny situations and dialogues quite like Hazelwood, and she had me in stitches.I\'ll grant you that the premise is a bit out there. What are the odds that the guy Elsie is hating/lusting after, is also the brother of a guy she\'s fake-dating, while also being the only person who almost beat her at Go, while also being the guy who irreparably damaged her field of study back in the day, while also being the head of the physics department at MIT where she is interviewing? I\'ll tell you what, it\'s 100% according to this book.But as the story went on, Elsie started to annoy me. First, she refuses to believe that Jack is attracted to her even though he tells her so on multiple occasions. At one point, she even interprets him saying ""Can I take you out?"" as he wants to murder her mob-style. Like what?Elsie also takes people-pleasing to heretofore-unseen heights. She lies to her roommate about pretty much every preference she has. She runs interference for her brothers at her mom\'s behest even though she doesn\'t want to. And she must get her mentor\'s approval before accepting a job offer that would give her several times her current salary and health insurance. Have mercy! My eyeballs were bruised from all the rolling.It\'s no secret that I prefer my female characters to be strong and smart, ready to kick ass and save the world. Elsie is strong in her work, but the opposite in every other way. And slowly, over many demure ""You can\'t possibly like me,"" it started to grate on my nerves. Not even Hazelwood\'s many comedic reliefs can save it from such never-ending waffling and meekness.This may just have been a case where I wasn\'t a good fit for the book. Without being able to connect with Elsie, I never really invested in the story. Not to mention I couldn\'t feel any chemistry between Jack and Elsie, and it all made for a rather lackluster read by the end.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:The Love HypothesisLove on the BrainThe STEMinist NovellasUnder One RoofStuck with You~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

Better than theLove Hypothesis(4-stars) andLove on the Brain(3-stars)! Honestly, my favorite contemporary romance of the year! 🤩Ali Hazelwood is the QUEEN OF STEM ROMANCE!Seriously, I could give two flying f*cks about STEM, yet somehow Ali is able to center an entire story around it while making it interesting and explaining it in a way that allows me to understand. But what always stands out is the way Ali portrays the struggles women in STEM have to go through. From blatant sexism to sexual harassment to manipulation, the challenges are appalling and endless. I specifically liked how she dives into the \'type\' of acceptable women in STEM:""The you people want is sharp, impeccable, perfect enough to justify your intrusion in a field that for centuries has been \'rightfully\' male. But not too perfect, because apparently only \'stone-cold bitches\' are like that, and they do not make for congenial, affable colleagues.""For fuck\'s sake, that\'s insane, but the absolute truth. It\'s infuriating to see the amount of pandering women in STEM have to do to the men in their field so that they are accepted. Once again, thank you, Ali Hazelwood, for bringing awareness to such an important topic.I really connected to Elsie on a personal level.Elsie has been a people pleaser her entire life, to the point that she masquerades many different faces around different people in order to fit their expectations or make them love and accept her. This begs the question of who is the real Elsie Hannaway? Unfortunately, Elsie doesn\'t really know since she\'s been living her life for others and ignores what she truly wants and needs. I know some people might think that the extent to which she people pleases is dramatic, but I can with 100% certainty say, I\'ve been her. Yes, I\'ve put on facades to make people feel more at ease. I\'ve lied about my likes and interests to fit in with people. I\'ve tampered down my own personality so people will find me more acceptable. I\'ve done things I didn\'t want to do because it\'s what was expected of me. And this didn\'t just happen with strangers. It also happened around friends and family. And let me tell you, it was exhausting and terrifying not being able to just be who you are - living in constant fear that someone will dislike you or find you weird or think you\'re beneath them. Luckily, I went to therapy and have worked on breaking out of the people-pleasing cycle. And I\'m so glad Elsie also starts therapy at the end. I really think Ali Hazelwood did a fantastic job portraying what it\'s like being a people-pleaser and how much it can emotionally and psychologically impact you.The friendship between Cece and Elsie was everything.I really adore Cece\'s humor and how incredibly loyal, supportive, and loving she is to Elise. And even after finding out Elsie hasn\'t been completely open and honest with her, Cece\'s first instinct is to say,""I will love you forever.""My heart nearly burst wide open because that is true love.Jack. The love of my life. One of my favorite MMC of all time!Where do I even begin with this man? He\'s perceptive, confident, honest, charming, thoughtful, intelligent, kind, handsome, sexy, and pretty much the most perfect man to ever be written! I love him (in case you can\'t tell lol). Not only does he fall first, but he is a huge freaking simp for Elsie and just wants to take care of her. Seriously, this guy is a dream. 😍 But what I love even more is that Jack is a supportive KING! Jack encourages Elsie to just be herself, and while she struggles to learn exactly whose that is, he is there with constant love and support, and lets her discover these things in her own time.The romance is perfection!We start with so much tension, misconceptions, and hate (on Elsie\'s side), and then it explodes into this profoundly wonderful and deeply emotional love. There\'s so much chemistry, respect, love, and care between these two that it makes my heart soar.The spice was a RIDE!Our girl Elsie has never really enjoyed sex or felt much sexual attraction towards anyone . . . before Jack. And while Elsie wants to just jump his bones, Jack takes his time and focuses first and foremost on her pleasure and her pleasure alone, all so she can discover what she likes. And DAMN it is HOT. 🥵 This is the spiciest Ali Hazelwood book yet, and I ATE THAT SHIT UP!""I think I want to do this every day,"" he responds, kissing my pussy like he would my mouth. ""Every day for the rest of my life.""I also love that Jack sets some boundaries sexually because he wants to make sure this is truly something Elsie wants, and not just something she thinks she has to do for him to like her (which we learn is something she did with a previous partner).Overall, Love, Theoretically is a witty, charming, and sexy story with lots of depth that will make you laugh and tug at your heart.Ali Hazelwood\'s writing is a dream, the pacing is fantastic, and the characters are so amazing that you can\'t help but fall in love with them. I could go on and on about all the things I love about this book, but this would turn into a full-blown essay, so I\'ll stop here. But the bottom line is this is one of the best contemporary romance books I\'ve ever read. I 100% recommend reading it and hope you love it as much as I do!Thank you to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing Group for providing an eARC in exchange for an honest review!

If you let me""Yep, that\'s right. AND, I am just going to say it..... this book is BETTER than The Love Hypothesis, I said what I said.Elsie is an adjunct professor struggling to make ends meet financially while also not doing the work that she really feels passionate about when the opportunity of a lifetime, to teach/research at MIT, presents itself. She just has to nail her interview and all her dreams will come true. But there is just one problem. Jack Smith. Her professional nemesis, a man that she hates like it\'s her religion, and is also one of the deciding votes on whether or not she gets the job. Oh, and he also is the brother of the man she is fake dating. Whoops.Aahh! I LOVED this book so much. I am as shocked as anyone, bc its easily my favorite contemporary romance of the year so far. I was really weary going in bc of so many mixed reviews, but honestly this book just resonated with me. The romance is fantastic, I am a sucker for academic rivals and this one is done PERFECTLY! The tension is soooo good! It was objectively hilarious, the banter was top tier, the cast of supporting characters were absolutely delightful from her quirky best friend Cece to the puny professor Volkov and Jacks sweet brother and taciturn grandmother, they all served to move the story in someway and were fun and interesting. AND CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE ADAM AND OLIVE CAMEO?!!!! 😍😍 SO CUTE!!!!! Also, this is her best writing by far, the pacing is perfect, the story flows, it was funny and smart and well developed from start to finish.Elsie-I really, really love Elsie and I know that at times she isn\'t exactly easy to love bc she masks so much but I really appreciated her struggles with her identity. She has formed this survival instinct born from childhood emotional neglect and then later just being a woman trying to get by in a field that is largely a boys club and she loses herself and ultimately this pseudo persona overwhelms her whole life . I really liked seeing a woman become self aware and take steps to change that and that it was hard and not immediate. So often I see people say, well she should know better or she is too smart to be so oblivious, and sometimes that\'s true. But sometimes it\'s not, and there is a process of change that has to happen and those paths are never neat or pretty and I really appreciated that progression in her character arc. And also, a high IQ doesn\'t always equal a high EQ, being smart doesn\'t exempt you from having deep emotional issues and doesn\'t make you any less smart, it just makes you human.Jack-Ahh this man is so whipped for Elsie and I LOVED it! And can we just talk about how good dirty he is?! I already have a thing for the surly Professor type and this is another one that goes on the roster of top hot teachers bc damn! The fireworks and the chemistry between Jack and Elsie were AMAZING! I ate it up and also I thought the sex scenes were super hot and I also appreciated that they were realistic. I kind of liked that they were trial and error bc not everyone is some sexpert like you read in so many novels. But besides that, I love how he respects Elsie and her talent. He is attentive to everything about her and sees the real her and forces her to be herself and drop the pretense but he does it in a way that is so non judgmental and supportive of what Elsie wants for herself and not everyone else including him. I love that he isn\'t perfect either and also struggling with his own issues.Random things I loved-CeCe, Elsie\'s best friend is so funny and weird and she made me laugh the entire book.-George was so sweet!-The grandmother, you gotta love an old lady that gives zero fucks and tells it like it is.-The Twilight references 🤌-The Hoth reference!!-Olive and Adam 😭😭'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""Oh, wow.

I mean to be fair I did expect a big guy to fall (first) for a small girl and fuck her without a condom. It’s just that unfortunately this time the big guy was a little bland and I didn’t fall for him and the small girl was dumb af, especially for a brilliant scientist.Maybe Twilight fans will appreciate the Twilight references and the fact that Elsie reads people (almost like Edward) but Jack is the only person she can’t read (almost like Bella), but I’m not a Twilight fan.On top of that Elsie’s entire career can be a trigger and don’t even get me started on Jack’s childhood. However that’s probably a me problem.I didn’t even like the spice 🫣 she tried to kiss him and his reaction was the weirdest thing ever 😳However I have to admit it was low on miscommunication compared to the previous books so there’s progress!My favorite part was meeting Adam and Olive 🥹——-Okay, I didn’t get the arc, so you have to clean up the shit yourself, girl.

For a year.Sincerely,Dab'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'HEAVEN FOR NERDS, that\'s what this book is (I\'m nerds)OVERALL THOUGHTS: This book was just WHAT I needed, WHEN I needed it! I\'ve only read The Love Hypothesis by this author before and it was highly enjoyable (I rated it 4 stars). BUT THIS ONE WAS AMAZING. To be honest, this is not my original opinion, but I\'ve seen people say this is Hazelwood\'s best work so far. I\'m not exactly qualified to speak on this, BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT I LOVED THIS BOOK. Yes the romance was very typically Ali Hazelwood, highly unrealistic and bubbly, but you simply cannot hate it. However, there were certain parts of this story that really sticked out to me and for that reason I\'ll list them here:1. THE PLOT - I would suggest going into this book without reading the blurb. I haven\'t read it before reading the actual book and that\'s why this was like an Easter egg to me. Important plot points were revealed early in the book, BUT THOSE REVELATION SCENES were so good, my Kindle flew across the room. This is another Ali Hazelwood ""Women in STEM find unrealistically good gigantic men"" novel and that\'s all you need to know. And yeah, they\'re physicists in this one!2. THEORISTS VS EXPERIMENTALISTS - Listen, I don\'t care for physics, I had an A back in high school but I always hated the subject (sorry not sorry). Which means, theories and experiments on crystals, research papers on quantum mechanics and what not don\'t mean much to me, but in this little novel (not really little, this was THICK) YOU CAN\'T POSSIBLY IMAGINE HOW MUCH BANTER WE GOT from their scientific disagreements. Sign me up, nerds are hot! But also like, we didn\'t get TMI on those topics, so I didn\'t feel suffocated.3. THE JOKES - This book had me LAUGHING on so many occasions. And I\'m not big on laughing while reading, especially LAUGHING OUT LOUD! But hey, I was gasping at some of these. And unfortunately, most of those dad jokes that one professor (can\'t be bothered to check his name again) threw around had me hollering. ALSO, student mail that Elsie received was peak humour.4. POP CULTURE REFERENCES - As much as I can remember, Ali Hazelwood is big on these. Here, it was like every other sentence. But my silly little gemini brain feeds off of them! Barbie was mentioned, Chris Nolan (TWICE), A PERFECT CURE FOR MY POST-BARBENHEIMER DEPRESSION (I don\'t know if that\'s a thing, pls tell me is anyone has it). Like I said, I got this book WHEN I needed it and it was WHAT I needed.5. ACADEMIA REALNESS - this aspect is something I admire Ali Hazelwood for. And said aspect was more prominent in this book than in The Love Hypothesis. Even though these books are unrealistic (I\'m tired of myself saying that), they still deliver some very real situations that happen in STEM surroundings almost every day. I\'m a med student myself and I\'ve spent 4 years already in this atmosphere, so certain struggles (money, women in science, stealing work, struggling to achieve your goals, abandoning your interests for your scientific dream) Elsie has (had) I really can identify with. Hazelwood gives you this very cruel manly toxic world and offers you a perfect fairytale escape, MOTHER ENERGY!🧎🏼\u200d♀️6. MEDICAL CONDITION REP - Our female protagonist in this novel has diabetes type 1, while she doesn\'t have health insurance and has to finance each and every insulin bolus herself. I\'m not making it to be this big Nobel-prize-for-peace thing, but it was nice to see this very common but life-threatening condition represented in popular fiction!CHARACTERS I usually describe main characters separately but I won\'t be doing that here. I loved Elsie and Jack equally. Their chemistry was really well-written. Many aspects of their personalities are sort of spoilers so I also won\'t be sharing those. Other aspects were written above. One thing tho, Jack\'s physical description reminds me of Dominic Sherwood (used to act in the terrible Shadowhunters show). Did anyone else get that reference (was he by any chance based on Dom or am I making that up)? Pls tell me in the comments. 🧐NOTE: This book was much spicier that The Love Hypothesis so do with that info what you want! 🤭I CAN\'T WAIT TO READ MORE ALI HAZELWOOD!💕💕'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Oh my GOD this book. Where do I even start? First of all, 5 stars. Easy. EASY 5 stars. There’s just something about the stories Ali Hazelwood crafts and the personalities she writes that hit with me. I loved The Love Hypothesis beyond words and was a bit iffy on Love on the Brain, so I wasn’t quite sure how this one was going to go, but oh my god she delivered again.@baskinsuns on tiktok has a really great video on this topic, but the way that Ali Hazelwood writes these male love interests who have such a deep and gentlelikeof the heroine is so…ooh she’s ruining my life. Yes it’s a romance novel so obviously they fall in love, but Jack Smith genuinely likes and enjoys Elsie as a person outside of his romantic love for her. He respects her, he admires her, he wants to hear her talk about the things she enjoys and he wants to experience them with her simply because it makes her happy. There’s a softness to the way Ali Hazelwood’s men care for their partners that just hits different.And the academic rivals in this book? Top fucking tier. From the very get go. It’s delicious. Delectable. I’m eating it up on every goddamn page. The dynamic it engenders between Elsie - the consummate People Pleaser - and the love interest being the one person she doesn’t care about pleasing is amazing.The story is beyond engaging, it went in some directions I didn’t expect it to go, it had me rooting for physics debates, and I could have read another hundred pages of these two.And you know what really REALLY shows how much I love this book? If you’ve been here for a little while you probably know I hate pop culture references in books. Viscerally. This book is at minimum 8% TWILIGHT references, and it was still an easy 5 stars. No question about it.I loved our main couple, I loved the side characters (I would read an entire novella about visits with Millicent), I was super invested in the plot, and the third act and finale is just…everything is so good.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'I think that ending the acknowledgements section of this book with the sentence ""Time is a finite and precious resource, and I\'m constantly overcome with emotion that people choose to spend it on my words"" was not particularly nice of the author to do. But the time isn\'t coming back, and if there\'s one thing I intend to do tonight, it\'s succumb to the sunk cost fallacy. On with the review.I tend to leave Ali Hazelwood alone because I\'m not in her intended demographic (read: person who can see one character responding to another character\'s ignorance about clothes with ""Wow. Men."" without wanting to die), but I picked this up because I saw that the protagonist works as a hired girlfriend, and I wanted to know whether it was going to be offensive or not. It is, which is sad, because the author has clearly worked very hard to make it less so; there\'s a point early when she specifies that the work she doescertainlydoesn\'t include sex, and then reassures us that she does believe sex work is real work, ""and people who engage in it are just as deserving of respect as ballerinas, or firefighters, or hedge fund managers."" Sure! Great! Hedge fund managing is not real work, but I get where you\'re coming from!It\'s just that this comes in the same book as the character referring to cracking a bad pun in order to increase her chances of getting a job as ""this prostitution of my sense of humor"", and the whole premise is that the love interest is the person she can ""be her real self around"", unlike her clients, even though he is 1) on her hiring committee and 2) immediately after he leaves her hiring committee, offers her a job. Also, the heroine\'s roommate, who also works as a hired girlfriend, is ""way too beautiful"" to be good at it without problems. I mean, okay.Honestly, the author just doesn\'t seem particularly interested in the whole premise, except as a way to emphasize that the heroine\'s people-pleasing problems arereallybad—I mean, they\'re so bad that she even... lets herself be PAID to pretend to DATE. The whole line between ""faking being a girlfriend"" and ""working as a girlfriend"" seems pretty unclear to Hazelwood—some of the work entails making up stories to her clients\' family and friends about how the two of them met and whether she\'s being paid, which is obviously faking something, but she also specifies that other gigs just entail ""going places as arm candy"" without talking. I bring this up because I do kind of feel that the author believes (or is working on believing) that sex-adjacent work isn\'t inherently shameful, but she does think on some level itisinherently dishonest. Which: mm.Mainly the reason I feel this way is because the whole arc of the novel is our heroine getting over her people-pleasing tendencies. At this point I need to be clear that this is just not a very well-written character trait. She refers, constantly, to having a different version of herself for every social situation, but what we actually see her do is ""say something nice to a girl who\'s about to cry"", ""crack jokes to someone who enjoys jokes"", ""pretend to like movies she doesn\'t like"", and ""help sort out family problems when her mom asks her to."" At one point she says she\'s about to tell us her tried-and-true procedure for Becoming A Different Person, and it is, in full: 1) Figure out what the other person needs. 2) Plan to do it. 3) Do it. Like—can we get something about, I don\'t know, observing body language? Altering tone? The protagonist references ""code-switching"" by name, but she never seems to use different registers for different situations? Plato identified four types of flattery off the top of his head and he didn\'t even have Google, man, is this really the best we can do? Anyway. You can see how this person would get pushed around a lot, sure (a female romance protagonist? with no backbone? Groundbreaking.), but the shapeshifting social chameleon that we\'re told about just never really appears.What does appear is someone who\'s considerate of others, but absolutely miserable about that, and only feels like her ""real self"" when she\'s yelling at the love interest. From the bottom of my heart: \'kay. How Ithinkthe author intended these scenes to come across, though, is less that the heroine is constantly shapeshifting into new people and more that she is someone constantly in what we might call ""customer service mode"".I feel, generally, weird about the idea that someone who can\'t switch out of customer service mode makes a particularly good escort, and it would remain a kind of weird itch in the back of my brain, but that line about ""prostitution of my sense of humor"" pushes it over the line for me a little. It\'s hard to shake the feeling that Hazelwood has articulated to herself that Elsie is ""prostituting her personality out to everyone she meets"", or something of that nature. (Not sexually, of course! She\'ll describe the sex with her ex that she didn\'t enjoy at all and only had to please him, but she wasn\'t beingpaidfor it!) I feel weird when the heroine reassures the hero that her last client (his brother) is so nice that she ""would have [worked as his girlfriend] for free"". And I feel weirder when the heroine and the hero\'s whole relationship seems to consist of him going ""What do you wanna do?"", her saying, ""What doyouwanna do?"", and him going sternly, ""No... what doyouwanna do?"" until she gets wildly turned on.Like—again, this man is on her hiring committee. I don\'t really buy that she simply can\'t turn on customer-service mode with him just because she can\'t read his face. (In a book where the heroine\'s number one thing is Loving The Twilight Saga, I will admit that ""he\'s the only person whose mind she can\'t read!!!"" as a plot point is absolutely hilarious.) When inauthenticity is so explicitly tied to her escort work, and she falls for him because he aggressively refuses to let her be ""inauthentic"", it feels... kind of like she\'s a ~fallen woman who he\'s saving~, if you see what I mean.Anyway, I should note that she has Type 1 diabetes and, due to sudden and plot-convenient miscalculations of her blood sugar, twice faints dramatically in his arms. It\'s so hard to get a proper case of consumption these days.There are at least three plot-relevant issues of miscommunication that happen because, just as someone is about to say something important, something loud or disgusting happens in the background. Also, the protagonist once describes ""fantasies of filling [the hero] with candy and taking a bat to him"". Time is a finite and precious resource, and it becomes increasingly evident that the Fates have not marked me to spend it on shit that is good. At this point I will accept ""wild"", I guess.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""You need a life-saving advice?

And intelligent...and infuriating...)","[{'rating': 1, 'content': ""I have a love-hate relationship with Ali Hazelwood's writing and please excuse me if this review gets a tad too expressive 😊 I was really excited to read this but the whole experience was a massively disappointing one.It started off decent and interesting.I liked Mallory,her looking out for her family and siblings was something that resonated with me on some level. I liked her relationship with her sisters and how selflessly she gave for years and years. Sabrina and Darcy were okayish. I liked Sabrina better, as Darcy was all over the place. Look, I know it's not a fair comment given she's just 12 but am gonna tell you why she pissed me off, or rather Ali's writing pissed me off.I found the book after a 100 page mark to be boring and getting worse.Although I liked the chess elements and it was interesting enough to keep me reading, but I didn't sign up for chess alone. I thought I was promised romance too, on which I'll elaborate further.First, I'll come toNolan.Was he there in the book? Oh, he was? Where? Oh, he was the love interest. Was there a blossoming love? Oh, there was... Where? Basically, he was so basic, he is forgettable. He has the personality of a rock. The man has no expression. I couldn't care less if he had something to say or not, which mostly he does not. He just pouts, glances, glares and that's his day.The romance did not come across as romance,or even a budding one at that. Mallory and Nolan had minimal chemistry. They came across as colleagues throughout the book and nothing more. Their interactions were made to appear as something deep but it really wasn't.Coming to my not so favorite topic- Ali's writing.I know it's her first YA book but it came across as trying TOO hard. The overloading of unfunny jokes was just cringe worthy. The gen Z references were never ending. But the worst of all was how she wrote about sex.Now, I know this might be perceived as unpopular in today's world but YA does not need to have a lot of sex talk in it.Few sentences, one or two paragraphs talking about it in a mature and tasteful and educational manner is fine. But when the 12 year old character starts pestering the adults to talk about their sex life while talking about her adult sister's sex life to a man she just met, is just creepy, and sends a wrong message. Sure, teens talk about sex and make sex jokes- but amongst themselves. Not to some random guy they have just met!! Also, why is there so much sex talk in this book when the targeted audience is not NA.I might be a bit old school here but I stay firm in my position- LET YA BOOKS BE YA!!Authors must be cautious in how they deal with sex in this genre.

It’ll come up a lot. Like massive arms and massive hands, which is how you know he is packing a massive…rook to knight combo. That’s how chess works, right? I’m not really sure but that is what is so great aboutCheck & Matebecause even if you previously had no interest in chess this book is so charming and energetic about the game that you’ll have a great time no matter what. I am absolute dog shit at chess—my phone app has beaten me enough to accept this—but I am delighted that Hazelwood said “you know what should be sexy?CHESS!” Hazelwood has made a name for herself with a wildly successful series of spicy adult novels featuring young women navigating fields typically gatekept by men and finding romance and here she enters the realm of YA where 18 year old Mallory returns to the world of chess, rusty from a long hiatus inflicted by shame and keeping her family afloat. Now she must face-off against misogynistic expectations and chess world champion slash thirst trap icon Nolan “I swear I’m not an Adam Driver Insert” Sawyer. The “Kingkiller”. The man with the big, meaty, sexy hands (remember this). But also the man she embarrassed by defeating in her first match, making her the new, hot topic about Chess World. Hazelwood writes with bubbly wit and while the constant corporate branding name drops might make one wonder if this book is collecting ad revenue, it's a fresh and fun rom-com that deals with themes of teen parentification, friendship anxieties and being thrust into a judgemental spotlight where the personal life you can barely keep from falling apart is suddenly the topic of social media speculation.Check & Mateis as corny as it is horny but, honestly, it's also just a good time that knows its audience well.‘His movements, when he touches the pieces, are precise, economical, strong. I hate myself for noticing that.’Girl, trust me, we all noticed that. Anyways, I found the premise of this to be quite promising and it lives up to it. It’s almost interesting enough to uphold the reluctant rivals to lovers engine that drives the story. While most realistic-fiction YA tends towards a high school setting, it was refreshing to see this being set in chess tournaments and libraries (‘God bless libraries.’ Agreed). Part of the premise is that chess is now the Big Thing thanks to Tiktok and Sawyer, the bad boy of chess, for inspiring a lot of content around his looks and temper tantrums (Kylo Ren behavior…), which, sure, I could believe that happening in this post-The Queen’s Gambit-fame, social media influenced world. And the youth getting really into chess is a super cool idea, I’d love that to happen. It also helps raise the stakes in this book because chess matches are covered like they are the Super Bowl and the cash prize is enormous. And so are Sawyer’s arms.The financial opportunities are key to our gal Mal’s motivations, and shd has more or less vanished from her own life in order to raise her aggressively-tween sisters and care for her sick mother. Hazelwood presents the hardships of a parentified teen who feels cornered by her own life that has been bent towards constant service of others to the point that taking time for herself is guilt-inducing. But all of chess is cloaked in a sense of shame for her and she hadn’t played in years, though the reason behind this is something Hazelwood only teases until the big reveal late in the novel (though its so hinted at I doubt the reason will come as a surprise to anyone after the first 20 pages). Hazelwood captures being burnt out and frustrated well while also making detangling all her insecurities a coming-of-age narrative nestled into the overall plot.‘There’s lots to consider. My feelings about chess, for one, which I cannot disentangle from my feelings for Dad. They are twisted, knotted together. There’s pain. Regret. Nostalgia. Guilt. Hate. Above all, there’s anger. So much anger inside me. Mountains of it, entire blasing landscapes without a single furyless corner in them.’The YA genre suits Hazelwood well, being able to turn on the firehose of emotions and make the more immature or quippy moments read as more age appropriate as it does in some of the adult novels Hazelwood often gets compared with. I enjoyed that the characters are older than most YA, being in that sort of anxiety-ridden purgatory between high school and “being an adult”. A great example of this is Mallory’s friendship with Easton and the interplay of Mallory feeling FOMO as Easton goes off to college while Easton worries she is being similarly phased out due to Mallory’s rising-star adventures. While Hazelwood is known for being pretty spicy she tones it back a lot here to suit a YA audience in ways that never feel like self-censorship. There’s still a lot of waistband grabbing (those big, manly hands…) and brief steamy moments though its mostly fade-to-black. Perhaps the lack of sex in the book also helped focus on ensuring the plot held up and was engaging. Truthfully, I couldn’t put this down.Still, I liked these characters—the dialog is fun and snarky without feeling like it needs toonlybe one-liners to the point of absurdity—and while Mal and Sawyer’s relationship sometimes seems to conveniently progress despite them really only talking about chess its all pretty cute. Sawyer’s character works well as an example of misconstrued perceptions on a person and behind the mystique he is actually quite a lovable person who treats Mallory well. He’s also possibly an Adam Driver-cast insert as both Driver and Star Wars get a call-out in text. This seems to be Hazelwood’s thing andThe Love Hypothesisbegan as Star Wars Reylo fanfiction in a STEM field and minus Kylo Ren’s penchant for war crimes. Plus we have the whole Mallory as a sort of “chosen one” who defeats temper tantrum boy who has trained for years which isn’t NOT the plot ofForce Awakensif you squint at it. Though Sawyer’s grandfather and his mental health issues come up, thankfully he wasn’t notable for having committed a genocide. Have I mentioned that this guy is hulking?‘Most women in chess decide to skip these events and complete in women-only tournaments. I bet you’re wondering why.’While Sawyer is supportive and sweet, the rest of the chess world is a minefield of misogyny for Mallory to navigate. Journalists love to ask her ‘how does it feel to be a women in chess?’ and her first experience with Koch—essentially the villain of the book—is him asking if she beat Sawyer by dressing evocatively. Good on Hazelwood for addressing the extra pressures and judgment on a woman in male-coded fields while inspiring young women to embrace their hobbies and strengths and achieve in whatever they want to do. But also good on her for making Koch so fun to hate. I mean, this guy is basically some teenage Ben Shapiro character twiddling his evil mustache (okay Koch doesn’t have a mustache but you get the idea) and being insufferable to everyone. You’ll want to punch him. A few times.There are a lot of complaints online about the use of slang and pop culture references here, which is whatever. Does it seem like a sort of eye rolling technique to be “this is how teens talk right?”, sure. But I do want to start a conspiracy theory that books will have product inserts as the new form of tv commercials because Hazelwood name-checks so many corporate brands and highly-specific product names that it feels weird. It’s like when the kid is sleep-talking brands inWhite Noiseand I kept joking that this book is generating ad revenue to keep the publishing industry rolling.After having read Colleen Hoover and Emily Henry this year, I figured I should complete the trifecta and read an Ali Hazelwood and I’m pretty glad I did. Overall, this was pretty fun. It moves at a quick pace (shocking for a story about chess games, I know) and has some pretty fun ups-and-downs while following a fairly formulaic romance plotline. Sure I could probably nitpick stuff about plot holes or whatever, but at the end of the day that seems beside the point to me. I’m judging this based on my rule I’ve just now invented called theA Knights TaleRule: believability is beside the point when you came to laugh along to a story about Heath Ledger looking great on a horse. This is fun and cute and I had a pleasant time reading it. It also achieves its main goal: making chess seem sexy. So excuse me, I’m going to go get my ass kicked by my chess app again and pretend I’m Gary Kasparov playing against Deep Blue.3.5/5“Chess is a bad idea.”“Why?”“Look where it got me.”“It got you here.

Though, if you are familiar with the pattern followed in Ali Hazelwood’s other books, you can probably guess the “twist” that comes towards the end.The character dynamics among the MC’s family felt really interesting and made Mallory feel much more like a real person. It made me wish we had gotten more of the same with Sawyer’s found family outside of the interactions with Mallory so I could see him as more than an obscenely tall, love interest and chess machine.In case you are wondering if there is any variety in the character descriptions from her other books, I feel I should point out that Ms. Hazelwood remains consistent in her writing. Paraphrased examples: “His hands are massive” and “I couldn’t miss him because he stands a head everyone else in the room”I will likely continue to read her books because they’re fun, typically light reads, but I wish she would give us some diversity in her characters.

I\'ve heard from many people that Ali Hazelwood writes very cringe smutty scenes, but I had never read her books before this one, but let me tell you, this book had no smut. If i\'m going to be honest, I went into this book completely blind, which I think made me love it even more. I couldn\'t stop laughing the entire time, the characters had the best banter, the Gen-Z references had me cackling so much. The gorgeous pink cover is so gorgeous and I just fell in love. For my first time reading a book written by Ali Hazelwood, I can finally say I had the best experience. I laughed so much my stomach hurt, I had tears streaming down my face from all the laughing. I truly loved this book so much, it was cute, fluffy, fun, hilarious, and just so good. For those of you that haven\'t read this book yet, do yourself a huge favor and pick it up immediately, I can\'t recommend it enough.GEN-Z REFERENCES*Snapchat*BTS*OnlyFans*Twitter*Tiktok*Taylor Swift*Billie Eilish*Ed Sheeran body pillow (WHAT?)*Candy Crush*This is just the basic list, but there\'s plenty more.Mallory Greenleaf is done with chess. The destruction of chess destroyed her family for the worst. During a tournament, Mallory caught her father kissing another woman, meanwhile he had a family of his own. Since then, Mallory\'s father has unexpectedly passed away. After the sport of chess led to the destruction of her family four year earlier, Mallory\'s focus is now on her mom, her sisters, paying the bills, and her dead end job as a car mechanic to keep the lights on. Mallory is the oldest of three daughters, she plays surrogate mother as her mother is sick and can\'t really move, let alone take care of her other two daughters. Mallory\'s sister, Sabrina, drove me insane. Sabrina was totally ungrateful and only cared about herself. As Mallory was working her butt of trying to make ends meet, all Sabrina cared about was getting her derby bills paid. I couldn\'t help but cheer and love Mallory, I just wanted to reach into my kindle and give her the biggest hug ever, with no words. Mallory\'s main focus is on her mom and sisters, but that is until she begrudgingly agrees to play in one last charity tournament and wipes the board clean against Nolan Sawyer. Nolan is completely shocked that Mallory beat him, but he wants to keep playing her over and over again.Okay, how did Mallory and Nolan play a game for seven hours straight? The only thing I can do for seven hours is read and sleep. Nolan Sawyer is known as the ""Kingkiller"" of chess, currently the world champion and reigning bad boy of chess. Nolan is a tall, grumpy, and temperamental chess player on the outside, but on the inside he is a soft, sugary cinnamon roll. The only thing I had a issue with is that Ali Hazelwood would always talk about how tall Nolan was, like okay, I get it, Nolan is tall as fuck. Nolan was a sweetheart, he might be the bad boy of chess and the world champion, but he wanted to keep playing Mallory over and over to secretly help her become the best female chess player in the world. The things Nolan did for Mallory just warmed my heart so much.Cinnamon roll sweetheart, Nolan Sawyer, had my heart in a choke hold.I couldn\'t help but love Mallory and Nolan , they were just two precious souls. Nolan was very sarcastic and very blunt during press interviews, he was never afraid to speak what was on his mind. Despite Mallory being back in her chess world, she wants to keep her family out of it, but that\'s kind of hard when there\'s tabloids of Mallory and Nolan going around. Mallory and Nolan were just have a conversation, but people made the picture of them together go viral like Mallory and Nolan were dating.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '“When I’m with you, Mallory, everything is different. When I’m with you, I want to play more than I want to win.”It feels like I\'ve been deceived by Ali and this book. My first anticipated read of this month and this book definitely wasn\'t what I expected. I was so excited to read it because it is written by Ali and she said it\'s anangsty rivals to lovers story in chess worldbut it was more about chess tournaments and chess championships than Mallory and Nolan and their rivals to lovers romance. The plot had so much potential but the execution of it was a bit off and unsatisfactory. How can you expect me to read 350 pages about the never ending chess tournaments and how FIDE and all the things worked in chess world. There was just too much info dumping about it. I wantedmore focus on character\'s development and romantic partof the story.“He leans toward me over the table, dark eyes earnest, stars traveling on his skin. “Do you know how incredible you are?”Ali seriously need to stop using Gen Z referenceslike TikTok, OnlyFans, Riverdale, AO3, Discord, Jeff Bezos, Timothée Chalamet and Cole Sprouse in her books. I was so close to dnf this book because of these refrences. Honestly I never had any problem with Gen Z refrences in books but the way Ali tried to put these in almot every sentence and conversation between the characters made this book a bit cringe. My favourite things in this book were Nolan Sawyer, the romance part and Mallory\'s little sister Darcy. She was so adorably hilarious.“Why would you keep something that makes you think of me?” I feel him shrug.“Because I think of you anyway, Mallory.”The romance was cute and adorable.It was young love and even swoon-worthy but there wasn\'t much rivalry between Mallory and Nolan like the way Ali promoted it. There were some cute amd funny moments which I absolutely adored but I did not like the way Mallory treated him sometimes. The way Nolan cared for her and made sure she got the fellowship in chess was just so precious. He wanted to play chess with her and she denied him every single time and I understand her reasons but Nolan did everything he could to earn her trust. Nolan deserves so much better. Also I hated how he was more like a side character in this book than the""actual""side characters which is the worst that could happen to a mmc.He turns us around and then we’re on the unmade bed, the twisted sheets digging into my spine. “You’ll be playing the most beautiful chess I’ve ever seen, and I dream about having you under me. It’s fucking confusing.”➸ Nolan SawyerNolan the 20 year old number one world chess player, is a millionaire, the quiet and moody boy who is secretly a cinnamon roll for Mallory, was obsessed with Mallory because he lost a match to her and wanted her and did everything to have her, wanted to play a chess match with her and even begged her for a match because only she made him feel alive, spends time with Mallory\'s family and treats them like his own, knows how to complement and treats a woman. He is a perfect man.“Are you real?” The air between us swells, overflows. “Sometimes I’m scared that I imagined you. Sometimes I think you’re only in my head.”➸ Mallory GreenleafThe oldest sibling in her family who had to take care of her two younger sisters and her mother so I\'m sure you know what I\'m trying to tell you about her here. She had family issues and mostly daddy issues and on top of that commitment issues and it took her years to finally talk about them with her family and stop hating herself for them. I didn\'t like her but I also feel like she never deserves any of the shit she went through for years.“He studies me for longer than is comfortable. Galaxies pass through his black eyes, and I wonder whether this second could last a century. Whether the universe could be just me and him, understanding each other on a forever loop.”The endingwas a""typical Ali Hazelwood ending""with a third act breakup over a misunderstanding which can be cleared by talking but as usual the Fmc is too tired, too betrayed to even listen what mmc have to say in his defense. But then she realises she made a mistake and goes back to the mmc. I already knew what was about to happen in the end.Overall this book was fine and even enjoyable sometimes. I liked how Ali tried to step out of her usual""women in stem""books and tried something different. You might love this more than me if you are able to ignore all the Gen Z refrences and all the never ending chess tournaments.“Chess is a bad idea.”“Why?”“Look where it got me.”“It got you here. To me.”'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3.5/5Listen, was it perfect? No. Did this book have too many Gen Z references, including TikTok, OnlyFans, Riverdale, AO3, Discord, and some people I don\'t want to hear about in my romance books, like Jeff Bezos, Timothée Chalamet and Cole Sprouse? Yes. Especially at the beginning, when I thought I would literally put this book down because of this. Didn\'t I particularly like the heroine? Also yes.But, did this book have Nolan Sawyer, the number one chess player in the world at only twenty years old, who was rich, the quiet and intimidating one who was obsessed with the heroine and was able to do anything for her. Yes. Nolan Sawyer, my new type and dream man? Yes, yes and yes.""He turns us around and then we’re on the unmade bed, the twisted sheets digging into my spine. “You’ll be playing the most beautiful chess I’ve ever seen, and I dream about having you under me. It’s fucking confusing.”I just feel to my knees.""His full lips tremble for the barest second. “Are you real?” The air between us swells, overflows. “Sometimes I’m scared that I imagined you. Sometimes I think you’re only in my head.”I was pretty much crying there.“Why would you keep something that makes you think of me?” I feel him shrug. “Because I think of you anyway, Mallory.”I just feel to my knees. Again.“Chess is a bad idea.”“Why?”“Look where it got me.”“It got you here. To me.”I literally blushed and screamed into my pillow. I don\'t remember the last time this happened.""I roll my eyes. “No follow-up questions.”He leans toward me over the table, dark eyes earnest, stars traveling on his skin. “Do you know how incredible you are?”If someone told me that, I would start crying.In overall this book was worth reading for one person.

take my card and do what you want with it.however, i think everyone heard that ali decided to incorporate a dictionary of references that she thought were young, funny and cool (stop that, mom), invoking timothee chalamet\'s name more times than the main character\'s ginormous hands around that small tiny coffee mug. i kept thinking to myself that this would shred my reading to pieces, but you kind of get used to it (exposure therapy maybe? idk) and the story becomes engaging enough to make you forget that nolan is considered the sexiest boy of our generation and that there are several edits of him on tiktok - and it’s probably playing end game by taylor swift as a background audio.⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆ 🎀about the characters🎀 ⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆mallory greenleaf. our main character. our chess prodigy that no longer plays. our child playing the mother role for herbrattysisters. our daughter with daddy issues and, therefore, commitment issues (go get that therapy, pet). mal is sweet, smart, funny, kind, hardworking and extremely down to earth - in another words, it’s a very hard and difficult task not to adore her and cheer for her throughout the book - which sometimes makes you want to smack her head on the table so hard that she would maybe stop being so dense and selfless -PLEASEfor once in your life be a spoiled, bitchy and ego centrical teenage girl that only thinks of herself (breathes in and out to calm herself down). once you get through that, her unconditional love for her family is, indeed, really admirable and cute, the things she gave up for them and the shitty jobs she took for them, all of her sacrifices will make your heart ache and break a little. and that’s the reason why we love to see her finding herself once again in chess - this is not a spoiler because it is painfully obvious that she will play again eventually - like it’s a chess book, someone has to play at some point, right?

cause he is - just so you know. this poor boy has had it enough, he’s tired, he’s bored, he’s almost entering an existencial mid life crisis in his teenage years - like can you imagine being so intelligent and gifted that playing chess with other grandmasters (they’re like the cool and talented kids of chess) put’s you into a sleeping coma since their moves are so predictable to you.enters mallory. who manages to wipe the floor with him (her words, not mine) during a match. the boy is whipped and he knows it. - she rizzed him up with a checkmate, who knows.⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆ ♟️about the romance♟️ ⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆it’s cute. it’s sweet. it’s swoon worthy. it’s young love. it’s legs being kicked. it’s giggles being smothered. it’s cheeks being painted crimson and scarlet red. and it’s PG 13 - don’t you go crying and booing in my doorstep, now, please, because their interactions and affectionate moments and late night conversations and “can’t keep my hands/eyes to myself” are, indeed very lovable and heartwarming and - color me surprised - enough to make you love love love the romance. do we have a third act breakup? do we have a fall out? and does it happens in the last few pages? does she run away? can’t tell you that since,duh, spoilers, but what i’ll say is that whatever happened in the end didn’t bother me and it was actually necessary for mal’s growth - so there you have it, my little spoiler munchkin.⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆ 🎀about my final thoughts🎀 ⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆as you know, it was a four stars rating for me (clap your hands and make noise) since i truly loved and enjoyed it every second of it (there were some moments though that his hands wer- never mind i got distracted) and devoured the book like i haven’t been fed in ages - almost like a small victorian child going through the bubonic plague in the mid 1300s, but it was just me in a reading slump.but, maya, the references were so annoying and uncalled for - someone whined in the crowd(plot twist: it was me whining), now, don’t you worry my child, like i said in the beginning, you really get used to it and start to brush it off eventually, promise you (and cross my heart). and i think it’s pretty obvious that i’ll be recommending this gorgeous book to my lovely gals out here, but just for the ones that tend to enjoy this cutesy type of book, the ones that love wes bennett you know - if youonlylike dark romance, this shit is not for you, bub, however, if you go both ways, then you should definitely give it a shot, it’s no”i’m-going-to-make-your-life-miserable-and-spit-on-you-and-humillate-you-but-you-must-know-that-i-love-you-secretly”(which i vouch for, as a matter of fact, and am very into it also - will always love you darius) but more of a“i-know-that-i’m-staring-at-you-like-i-hate-you-but-in-reality-i-love-everything-you-do”kind of thing.noand who tf is the girl with the “i heart rome” shirt talking to mal in the end?

And they both have academic validation so theyNEEDto get top scores and be at the top of the class and its one or the other one week is him then its her ugh iconic. THEN they get paired up together for an assessment that is like half there grade and its SUPER important and so they have to work together on a engineering project/mathmatical problem/ biochemistry reaserch paper. and slowly they get to know eachother more than just this person i need to beat and they fall in love, and while in that relationship they still have that respectful rivaly and banter we all lovenumber three: something like the love on the brain where they are in a company building setting where a bunch of different academics are creating something amazing and groubdbreaking in science, the two main characters are two completly different people, one a biologist that looks at the evolution of animals and why creatures adapted due to enviromental changes. and a mechanical engineer, the biologist (lets make him a man because hey! lets break these gender norms) and hes there to help with something idk yet this is an idea not a story dont judge me im a humble reviewer, and the womans the mechanical engineer thats there to bring the entire thing to life. they are opposites in everyway, hes all nature and the evolution of life and shes the numbers, but it works somehow they get close and together. i dont know not my best idea but i like the number three so we are running with it.why not add in more than science? sprinkle some computor coders, they deserve a love story because coding is hard, add some teachnology, people discovering ai, mathematics is always fun (said no one but me ever) that would always be so fun to look at.and while your at it add in some queer rep madetwo women in stem fall in love, now that would be iconic. 💅oh and in all of them please no galexy leggins, unicorn socks or cat hoodies please our main character is meant to be smart and sophisticated not a crazy millenial cat lady she has more important things to be doing like discovering so many new things. 💪💪as a women in science i love what you are doing, but honestly, i think you have the ability, skill and popularity to go above and beyond with your message.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'i have a feeling; imma love this book..——okay, I think she understood the assignment. THIS COVER IS GORGEOUS !'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '“God bless libraries.”I haven\'t been to a library in so long because the closest one is so far, and it makes me so sad because I love them 😭Anyways, this is my second Ali Hazelwood book, the first being The Love Hypothesis, which I adored. I really want to read Love, Theoretically, but I haven\'t gotten around to it, but I will someday. I am honestly pretty disappointed in this, since I\'ve been expecting this book since it first was announced, and since the cover was first revealed, and I was so excited!But alas｡ﾟ•┈୨♡୧┈• ｡ﾟPlotI\'m usually pretty good at reading contemporaries or romances because the plot is super easy to follow, and that\'s exactly what this was.Except for all that chess lingo. I haven\'t played chess a day in my life, and I never intend to after learning what I have in this book. The game can go on for over six hours?? That\'s not happening, I think I\'ll stick to my little checkers board thank you very much.Anyways, back to the plot, I thought it was nice and simple, and great for a quick read.Now, my complaint is the fact that sometimes, authors write YA as if it\'s a middle grade novel. This book borders on the edge of YA and New adult or adult, because while it\'s advertised as YA, and the main character is 18, some of the jokes and scenes weren\'t very YA-ish. The only thing that stopped it from being new adult was the fade to black scene. I don\'t really care, because I can\'t lie, I was disappointed when I found out this book was YA. It probably would\'ve been better if it was adult, because some of those stupid childish jokes would\'ve been cut out. I don\'t know why people think that YA is geared towards more childish jokes, YA is not only being read by children.Here are some examples! I\'m sorry.“This morning my roommate repeatedly farted on my pillow because I dared to ask her not to practice her xylophone at 5:30 am.”this one legitimately made me close my eyes, close my book, and take a deep, long breath. Fart jokes became old in elementary school, and even then, I despised them.“Unclench your butthole, Mallory.��shut up“When he swallows, his throat bobs, a strong, mesmerizing movement that I notice because . . . I’m going bananapants?”actually shut upwelcome back to elementary school kids! I hope you have a FABULOUS VISITthere were too many fart jokes to count in one scene, and it made me want to walk all the way to the lake outside my house and chuck the book into it.and want to see one of the first sentences in the book?“Mrs. Agarwal is at her desk, pretending to grade papers but probably reading Bill Nye erotic fanfiction.”well then !I will admit....some scenes made me laugh. The book did get better as it progressed, which is the reason it has 3 stars instead of 2 ☺Oh, and I know Ali Hazelwood gets talked about for always making her male characters huge and her female characters tiny, so I tallied out how many times Nolan was described in any way as ""big"" or big compared to the main character, and I have concluded that it was around 13. Take that information and do what you will.Also, there were so many pop culture references in this that it was crazy. TikTok was mentioned a few times, and I didn\'t really care, which was surprising, but it got annoying to an extent, and then Taylor Swift was mentioned, but of course I didn\'t mind that, have you seen the Taylor\'s Version in my name? There were a lot of other bands and modern stuff, and this is why I stick to fantasy, where none of this is ever mentioned 😌 (I will admit, I liked the talk about Timothée Chalamet, only because I had his statistics song stuck in my head.)do not get me started on the Percy Jackson reference, I\'m trying to wipe it from my memory please and THANK YOU. I don\'t remember it all, but there\'s some about reading erotic Percy Jackson fanfics and having him and someone sixty-nine. I\'m not ok at the moment, save Percy.I don\'t remember who he\'s doing that with, I\'d rather not know anyways“because when I asked myself if I had the right to those tears, the answer was always no, and it was easy to stop myself.”shut the hell upSorry if I run out of quotes halfway through the review, there\'s like none in the quotes section and I don\'t want to go back into the book.｡ﾟ•┈୨♡୧┈• ｡ﾟThe CharactersI hated Mallory so much in the beginning of the book. She was getting on my nerves with her stupid attitude. I get that she was going through a lot, and I understand that, but she was so negative that even I, the queen of negativity, was flabbergasted. She believed the worst of everyone and everything, and it happened so often that I wanted to scream. Thankfully, she got better, like way better, and the end of the book. We love a good character development.Now Nolan\'s situation is complicated for me, because I\'deasilyfall in love with him, BUT, that is also the name of a close family member to me 😃 so let me tell you, my inner conflict was going crazy during certain parts of the story, because I loved him as a character, I love the tall, dark, and handsomes, especially when they\'re mysterious and cold, but I just couldn\'t get past that his name was someone I was related to! For this reason, he will not be added to my list of book boyfriends.I really liked the side characters, and Oz was the best character hands down. When he told Mallory off, I was grinning so hard because he was just saying facts and putting that girl in her place, and it was so satisfying.SABRINA WAS A BITCH THOUGH. I don\'t care if she\'s fourteen years old and some fourteen year olds are bitches, but she was so rude, I couldn\'t stand it.“I think about a deserted chessboard. Only the white king on it, standing on the home square. Alone, untethered, safe from threats. Free to roam.”｡ﾟ•┈୨♡୧┈• ｡ﾟThe RomanceI will admit, I did find the romance quite cute. A tad unrealistic, a tad fast, but it\'d make me boring if I nit-picked based on just those two things, so I\'ll let it slide. The tension between them was pretty well created, and some of their scenes actually made me giggle, which is the best thing ever in a romance book.Of course, this book also came with the good ol\' second act drama. I think it was kind of a miscommunication, but Mallory also really overreacted, because based on her need for money at the time, I don\'t see why she would\'ve gotten upset, or maybe I\'m just not that kind of person 😭I\'m also quite annoyed at the fact that we didn\'t get a solid reunion at the end. I had to read a ""two years later"" epilogue written in NEWSPAPER FORM. I DON\'T CARE I WANT TO SEE THEM INTERACTING AS AN ACTUAL COUPLE.｡ﾟ•┈୨♡୧┈• ｡ﾟoverall, unless you love YA that\'s on the way way upper side of YA but also has a ton of elementary school jokes that will make you want to throw the book into a lake and has a main character that you want to throw in the lake with said book, I\'d recommend skipping on this one.save yourselfthis review made me angry, so I\'m deducting my rating to 2.5 stars2.5 starsInstead of putting a quote, I will be putting all of the pop culture references I found while flipping through again!

I think she did it well.Yes, there’s innumerable references to everything popular right now, but I don’t think anything actually made me cringe.The chess part of the plot (as someone who knows less than nothing about chess) wasinteresting. I may not have understood all the terminology (what IS the Grünfeld) but I got the gist of it.The actual plot itself felt very cozy to me. Not a lot happened, there were more thoughts and feelings than anything else, and it was just really sweet.Ali’s books always tend to be quick reads, but I almost didn’t want to put this down, and if I haven’t had things to do...I definitely would have finished it in just a few hours.The characters were quite easily my favourite part, even though Ididwant to slap a particular sister once or twice.Mallory, the protagonist, felt very relatable to me. Maybe it’s because we’re both the oldest sister, maybe it’s because she (like me) has the unfortunate habit of trying to do everything herself, but all I know is that I really enjoyed her perspective.The only thing that could have made this book better isNolanhaving a POV. Tall, sarcastic men who don’t know how to function in society are always my favourites, so it’s no surprise I loved him.Emil and Tanuwere good side characters, and (if a little annoying at times) quite sweet.AndOz? I lost count of the times he made me laugh, with his threats and general grouchiness.All together, they’re the cast for a book I can only describe asadorable.————quotes————“Why would you keep something that makes you think of me?”“Because I think of you anyway, Mallory.”“He told me once that sometimes, with some people, it's not about winning or losing, That with some people, it's just about playing. Though for the longest time, I didn't really believe him.”“He’s tireless, unshakable. Driven in an indomitable, near- obsessive way. This iron- hard tenacity of his is an oddly attractive quality.”“I feel protected from attacks from all sides. Like the king during good chess.”“Even the good ones, they don’t know how it feels. They don’t know what it’s like, being told that you’re inherently destined to be second best.”“I resign. You win. Can I kiss you?”“I fall asleep mid game—for the second time in my life held by someone, for the second time in my life held by Nolan Sawyer.”“I’m going to fall over.

Crown of Midnight (Throne of Glass, #2)
",Sarah J. Maas,4.35,1309365,6331,"Young Adult, Romance, Fiction, Magic, Fae, Young Adult Fantasy, High Fantasy",420,15-08-2013,"An alternative cover edition for this ISBN can be foundhere.""A line that should never be crossed is about to be breached.It puts this entire castle in jeopardy—and the life of your friend.""From the throne of glass rules a king with a fist of iron and a soul as black as pitch. Assassin Celaena Sardothien won a brutal contest to become his Champion. Yet Celaena is far from loyal to the crown. She hides her secret vigilantly; she knows that the man she serves is bent on evil.Keeping up the deadly charade becomes increasingly difficult when Celaena realizes she is not the only one seeking justice. As she tries to untangle the mysteries buried deep within the glass castle, her closest relationships suffer. It seems no one is above questioning her allegiances—not the Crown Prince Dorian; not Chaol, the Captain of the Guard; not even her best friend, Nehemia, a foreign princess with a rebel heart.Then one terrible night, the secrets they have all been keeping lead to an unspeakable tragedy. As Celaena's world shatters, she will be forced to give up the very thing most precious to her and decide once and for all where her true loyalties lie... and whom she is ultimately willing to fight for.","[{'rating': 5, 'content': ""Shit seriously just went down.Oh wow, where do I start with this sequel? I wasn't even sure I was going to read it when I recently finishedThrone of Glassand found it entertaining but a poor excuse for fantasy. You want to know whatCrown of Midnightfelt like? It was like the author listened to every piece of criticism I could have thrown at the first book, listened to everything I loved and everything that irritated me... and then wrote a perfect kind of book. The kind I wanted the first one to be; the kind I hadn't dared to hope she might produce in this sequel. There was more action, more nastiness, more character development, more surprises, more complications, more sexy, no love triangle - all of this and a well-placed, never-saw-it-coming twist. Ms Maas, consider me impressed.Crown of Midnighttakes a huge step away from the tame romantic/bitchy drama of its predecessor and opens up a story that is a bigger, bloodier and meaner than I think many readers will be expecting. Celaena gets to fully explore all aspects of what it means to be an assassin in this book; she is tested constantly and you can see her growing and changing and learning as the story progresses. And this story is one tumultuous journey of extremely high ups and unbelievably low downs with Celaena taking relationships to all new levels and watching others fall apart. Old enemies resurface and we start to get a glimpse of just how big the picture Maas is painting for us actually is.One of the strengths of this book is having no idea how it's going to end. You might think that's a given, butThrone of Glassintroduced us to a plot that was fairly easy to see mapped out. We are told of the challenges Celaena must compete in and win, we know that's what the book is moving towards, and it isn't too much of a leap to assume that (one way or another) Celaena is going to emerge victorious. Not in this book. This book starts with a blank slate, any mysteries or troubles that are to come are completely unknown to us - so every turn the plot takes is a surprise and every surprise is thrilling. I can't wrap my head around justhow much betterthis sequel is. Maas has already grown as a writer and storyteller, making me wonder what she can possibly have in store for us next.The characters are also so much better developed in this book. Maas is brave enough here to allow the main characters to make mistakes, do the wrong things and test our ability to like them. Well, I don't know about you, but the new dimensions to their personalities, their faults and weaknesses, only served to make me like them more. Dorian surprised me most of all. InThrone of Glass, Dorian feels like something of a plot tool, a pretty little obstacle to Celaena and Chaol's romance. The scenes with him felt like filler between the parts I was actually waiting for. But not inCrown of Midnight! In this, Dorian emerges as an interesting character with secrets of his own; he makes sacrifices for the people he loves and his importance to the bigger story starts to become apparent.In short?Throne of Glass...Romance, love triangle, pretty dresses, one-dimensional characters, little action...Crown of Midnight...Badassery, twists, nastiness, betrayal, more action, magic, secrets...If you were so-so about the first one and considering *maybe* reading this, you have my thumbs up.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5/5 ⭐Full review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolf🐺Chaol Westfall, a well-trained, muscular grown-ass man, Captain of the Royal Guard: *gets all soft and smooshy in this book*me: *needs to wrap him in a blanket, feed him some good hot Romanian rice pudding with lemon and sour cherry jam and protect him from the rest of the world because he is that precious*-\tActual plans that I really think about considering in a very serious wayAfter reading the first book of the series,Throne of Glass, I knew that I enjoyCrown of Midnight, but I’d never anticipated I’d enjoy itthat much.I\'ve decided to read this book in a teeny-tiny complicated period of my life: I\'ve been categorized by my ophthalmologist (cuz yeah, I wear glasses and not one buttwopairs, one of them being for reading, cuz yeah, my blind arse doesn\'t see well enough) as a ""are case"" and my eyes are „smashed"" because of too much reading and it\'s not normal. Sooo I\'ve been put through an ""a carrot a day"" cure and also ""only 30 minutes of reading"" cure. Because of that, I was not able to actually read as much as I wanted. But this book is giving to me a dependence that I am totally approving of, made me read so super-humanly fast that I\'ve managed to actually read enough in a day to accumulate the plot, the characters\' stories and the magic happening in general in Sarah J. Maas’ world.This book was better than the first book from the beginning. I think it is so much easier to get into the second book of the series because you have the advantage of the first one. In some series, the second, third, fourth etc. books are not as good as the first one. But in this series, you can actuallysensethem getting better and better (or maybe this is only my opinion). So second book of the Throne of Glass series > the first book (but don’t get me wrong, Ilovedthe first book too).It is useless to talk about the plot at this point already: it’s the second book, some covered plans are being made in order to wipe the fussy king from the surface of this world. Talks about rebel alliances and plans and talks about some long-lost heir of Terrasen’s throne, Aelin Ashryver Galathynius start pumping the air of the book. Some think they are just rumours; some believe in them because their lives depend on these rumours. But until the end of the book, everything becomes just a huge ball of energy that absorbs everything (including your soul) and in my opinion, this is so important.Sarah J. Maas is, in my opinion, a genius mind. She makes us fall in love, she makes us sigh, get angry, cry, wanna die and so on. All these elements are important spices in the whole dish of a book. I don’t know about other people, every single person has a personal taste, but I really think that this whole series is based on a brilliant idea, also very good narrated, even though I’ve read only two books.Now, talking about spice, even though I am actually kind of a bit (more) in love with Dorian, the Crown Prince of Adarlan, and I think he is the most charming and witty son of a wicked king I’ve encountered (since present moment) in any of my reads (remember that I am fairly new to YA Fantasy club) and I love his beautiful soul and the way he and Celaena work together, I cannot not be happy to see how the relationship between Celaena and Chaol Westfall, Captain on the Guard, grew. At least in this particular book, at this given moment. Even though some batshit happens and Celaena goes cuckoo bird.Going back, this book, the second book out of seven, blew my mind, made me laugh, made me sigh, made me cry, made me mad. And it was fantastic. Totally worth every single second I’ve spent reading it. I loved it.Also, Nehemia Ytger, thank you for existing, Queen!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Wow!

It was so good and I\'m just absolutely reeling from that ending. Because. Wow.Sarah J. Maas just delivered on this sequel.""Enough! We have enough enemies as it is! There are worse things out there to face!""Celaena slowly turned to him, her face splattered with blood and eyes blazing bright. ""No, there aren\'t,"" she said. ""Because I\'m here now.""Celaena Sardothien ex-prisoner of the salt mines has risen to the position ofRoyal Assassin.She must follow every whim of her king for four years. Only then, will shefinally be freed.It was a hard bargain but Celaenathought she could handle it.She\'s killed many, many before - so how could killing for the King be any different?The Mad (or merely cruel?) King sees spies and traitors everywhere. He frequently sends her out to murder innocents. To murder -not to assassinate- and that makes all the difference.Very quickly Celaena finds ways to smuggle out these would-be-victims, but with the ever-rising number of ""survivors"" (any one of them could blow her cover), the ever-increasing threat from home and the reappearance of an oldfriend-how could she even hope to protect those who matter to her most?I absolutely love how our main character isconfident, beautiful and completely in control- it\'s such a refreshing change from all the awkward, please-tell-me-I\'m-pretty and helpless heroines that populate many YA books.If they wanted Adarlan\'s Assassin, they\'d get her.And Wyrd help them when she arrived.The side-characters are so well-done. There\'s a bit of a love-triangle. Normally, I\'d run away screaming at the hint of a love triangle (I\'ve suffered through so many terrible ones) but Sarah J. Maas executed it perfectly. (Is there anything that the Maas-ter can\'t do?)Plus, that ending justsucked out my last breath.It was such a twist and it was so incredibly badass.

This is what I\'d like to call a gorgeous sequel. Dare I say it, it might even topThrone of Glass!Celaena Sardothien is doing her job as King\'s Champion, meaning she\'s killing people that stepped on the king\'s toes. And now she\'s got a new target: Archer Finn, former crush and friend from the time when she was within the Assassin’s Guild. Turns out, she\'s not killing her targets, but faking their deaths, so she\'s in a lot of danger if someone discovers her secret. The stakes are higher now that Archer is a well-known figure in Rifthold and that he might be involved in a rebel group. To make events even more complicated, the half-Fae and long-dead Queen, Elena, is asking Celaena to find the source behind the King\'s power.“Everything in this world is magic. Thank you ever so kindly for stating the obvious.”Celaena was a goddamn badass. I wouldn\'t mess with her in a thousand years. We finally see her wild and deadly side, the one that I\'ve grown accustomed to in the prequel e-novellas and that wasn\'t fully explored inThrone of Glass. Sure, she\'s still that sassy, arrogant and sarcastic girl, but above all, she\'s an assassin. A ruthless killer. And when the ones she loves are in danger or threatened, she\'s unforgiving. That part of her really gives you goosebumps. Oh, and let\'s not forget when she\'s in for revenge. One word: lethal.She was a whirlwind of steel and blood. As he watched her cut through the men like they were stalks of wheat in a field, he understood how she had gotten so close to touching Endovier’s wall that day. And at last—after all these months—he saw the lethal predator he’d expected to find in the mines. There was nothing human in her eyes, nothing remotely merciful. It froze his heart.Dorian Havilliard. Chaol Westfall. Dorian, Chaol, Chaol, Dorian. Chaol is the same sweet, loyal, funny, protective and fierce warrior. I loved his easy banter with Celaena and his alpha-male demeanor. Prince Dorian Havilliard is still the same passionate, kind, intelligent young man that is slowly transforming into a great ruler. And they’re best friends! How can I choose?!*crying*“I worry because I care. Gods help me, I know I shouldn\'t, but I do. So I will always tell you to be careful, because I will always care what happens.”InCrown of Midnight, Chaol and Celaena are getting close. Like really close. And because of that, both of their relationships with Dorian become more strained, awkward and tense. And that\'s kind of the single thing that bothered me at Celaena: inThrone of Glass, she was all over Dorian... and now? She doesn\'t care about his feelings when he clearly loves her. And that just got me going mad. I wanted to hug Dorian several times and give him cookies.Still, things evolve a little bit between them on a platonic level when a heartbreaking twist makes Celaena not trust Chaol anymore. And another unexpected twist involving Dorian makes things one hundred times more interesting.“When you do, I want you to remember that it wouldn’t have made any difference to me. It’s never made any difference to me when it came to you. I’d still pick you. I’ll always pick you.”I\'ve read some reviews that say that the love triangle\'s fate is sealed after the first quarter of the book. But now, after reading it, I\'m not so sure. Especially after that second half and killer ending. I love Chaol with all my heart, but I can\'t help but hope that Celaena will end up with Dorian. Now, now, don\'t throw stones at me! It’s still aCinderellainspired book! They\'re both swoony guys, but I\'ve always loved Dorian a bit more. Might be because of the dark-haired, blue-eyed appearance. And possibly the arrogance. And the bookish and funny personality. Perhaps even the fact that he\'s a freaking prince.*dreamy sigh*“If you are captured, if you are hurt, you are beyond our reach. You will be entirely on your own.”“I’ll be fine.”“But I won’t be. Every day that you’re there, I will wonder what has become of you. I won’t.... I won’t forget you. Not for one hour.”Nehemia was such a great support for Celaena, even if she had her own agenda. The princess is one of those selfless characters that would give everything up for the sake of her people. She\'s fair, ambitious and dedicated. And she\'s the key-player that sets things in motion in this sequel. But in a gut-wrenching method that will surely have you shedding a few tears.The villain we love to hate: the King of Adarlan, Dorian\'s father. His plans turn out to be down-right evil and unnatural. I loathe that guy because he\'s so willing to exploit everyone around him for his own sake. I want himD.E.A.D.*guilty smile*As it was to be expected, we meet new characters. My favorite was Mort. Why? First of all, he\'s an ancienttalkingdoor knocker. Second of all, he\'s hilarious!When they left, Nehemia spent a few minutes studying Mort— mostly asking him questions about his creation spell, which he claimed to have forgotten, then claimed was too private, then claimed she had no business hearing.Archer Finn was hard to read, but I never trusted him behind all those pretty smiles and coward-like behavior. Never trust a courtesan. Oh, and of course, there\'s Baba Yellowlegs. Even the name gives you creeps. She\'s an old, manipulative witch whose favorite meal is consisted of young girls. Told you: creepy.The character development is really spectacular. You can see how Celaena, Chaol and Dorian grow. By the end of the novel, our heroine is not running from her past anymore; the Captain of the Guard is ready to sacrifice himself and face his father; and the Crown Prince starts to stand up to the King no matter the consequences.“Thank you for all that you have done for me, Dorian. Thank you for being my friend. For not being like the others.”The pace was definitely action driven. I\'m not kidding when I\'m saying that sooo much happened and some many plots started to unfold between my eyes. Crown of Midnight was a page-turner through and through and there was never a dull moment.“How long will you keep her here?” Dorian said, looking down the stairs.She had attacked the Captain of the Guard in front of his men. Worse than attacked.“As long as it takes,” Chaol said quietly.""For what?”“For her to decide not to kill us all.”Another think that surprised me was the fact that Celaena is keeping so many secrets I can\'t even keep count. There were two revelations regarding her: I suspected the one revealed in the end, but the other one totally caught me unprepared. Both are jaw-dropping twists that will completely change the outcome of her adventures.“I’ll come back,” she said quietly. “I’ll come back for you.”The world-building was exquisite! We learn so much more about Erilea, Adarlan and the history of the country. We delve deeper into the Fae magic. It\'s a top-notch high fantasy world, coupled with a darker atmosphere, mistery, magic and amazing characters. The result is a certain recipe for epicness, one that Sarah J. Mass gorgeously created with her mad writing skills.If you haven\'t started this series, I\'m begging you -- pick it upASAP. It\'s complex, emotional and completely captivating. You\'ll laugh, you\'ll cry, you\'ll swoon, you\'ll gasp in shock and you\'ll fall in love with the story.Crown of Midnightwas an excellent follow-up that might not end in a claw-your-yes-out sort of cliffhanger, but it will make you crave the next installment like air.

No, scratch that, it actually doesn’t even get close to the truth. XDI swear in comparison to the first book this truly was an action packed and suspenseful read! =)Alone the many awesome fight scenes and the countless revelations throughout the entire book were already enough to cause my head to spin! Plus Celaena finally lives up to her reputation as Adarlan’s best assassin and actually kills people, which was amazing and involuntarily made me love this even more! *lol*Yes, Sarah can write and her action scenes always had me at the edge of my seat. Once or twice I might have even been close to falling off of my chair, but that’s another matter for another day! ;-PFor now all you have to know is that”Crown of Midnight”was an awesome read and that it was able to keep me on my toes and considering how many books I already read, this certainly should speak for itself. ;-)Since I don’t really feel like talking aboutthe plot(you’ll read plenty of it in my characters section aka The Spoilery Spoiler Section anyway) I’ll do something completely mean and will only give you a few words:Celaena, Chaol, Dorian, The King, Roland, Kaltain, Nehemia, Archer, missions, blood, death, creepy, magic, dungeons, books and let’s not forget about Fleetfoot!There you go! *lol* Haha! Oh Jeez that’s so vague you’ll hate me! XDWell, anyway! *smiles innocently*Let’s get to my favourite section!The characters:Do I still have to say it?! Yes? Okay! This is the aforementioned “Spoilery Spoiler Part” so if you don’t want to read quotes or spoilers or my crazy thoughts, you better stop now and never return. ;-P Don’t say I didn’t warn you!Celaena:”Some days, it feels like another person did those things. And most of those lives I’m glad I ended. No matter the cause, though, it – it still takes away a little piece of you each time. So I don’t think I’ll ever forget them.”Celaena is so kick-ass, I love her!!! We finally saw the relentless killer in her and I just couldn’t get enough of it! I thoroughly enjoyed all of the fighting scenes and the one with Baba Yellowlegs was definitely the best! XD I can’t wait to read more about those Ironteeth Witch Clans and I really hope they’ll be a part of the other books! Aside from the action I probably enjoyed Celaena’s character development the most. She’s no longer afraid to show her true self and she doesn’t only open up to Chaol but also to Dorian. I can’t say how much I loved all those new revelations about her and the fact that she’s fae took me entirely by surprise. I definitely didn’t expect that and I was like“WOAH WHAT?!!!”when I read it! I mean I always knew she had a secret and Sarah mentioned it often enough, I certainly didn’t expect it to be this kind of secret though!! *lol* I’m sure after the promise at Nehemia’s grave we can expect great things in the future and I’m so curious about Wendlyn; I immediately want to start with“Heir of Fire”.”I failed him,” she said. “In every way that counted, I failed him.”Another long silence, then a sigh. “Not in one way.” Chaol said. “I bet he would have wanted you to survive – to live. So you didn’t fail him, not in that regard.””I want you to know,” she whispered to the wind, to the earth, to the body far beneath her, “that you were right. You were right. I am a coward. And I have been running for so long that I’ve forgotten what it is to stand and fight.””The ship began moving. And Chaol – the man she hated and loved so much that she could hardly think around him – just stood there, watching her go.”Chaol:”She was a whirlwind of steel and blood. As he watched her cut through the men as though they were stalks of wheat in a field, he understood how she had gotten so close to touching Endovier’s wall that day. And at last – after all these months – he saw the lethal predator he’d expected to find in the mines. There was nothing human in her eyes, nothing remotely merciful. It froze his heart.”Ahh Chaol! My problem child! *sighs* I don’t hate him, actually I like him, butARGH!!!!He screwed up big time in this one and I just couldn’t believe what I read! I mean come on! You’re the Captain of the King’s Guard! You should be smarter than that!!! Seriously, in this book I really began to hate his loyalty to the king and it made me more than just angry that he never even thought about questioning the king’s orders! Chaol basically is the embodiment of the unthinking and unblinking soldier! Stupidly loyal to a fault!!! And that moment when he got kidnapped in his own domain?WHAT THE FREAKEDY FREAKING HELL?!Like: Are you kidding me!? I can’t help but wonder how he even became the Captain of the Guard. *lol* I’m so not impressed. Not at all! Plus he should have told Celaena about Nehemia, but he didn’t and that once again tells me that he still doesn’t trust her. At the end I felt kind of sad for him though. I mean he finally realised that he was blind and probably made the biggest mistake of his life. Unfortunately by then it was already too late to change anything about his misguided actions and he ended up suffering like crazy. Poor Chaol! =(”Once, Chaol might have argued. Once, he might have protested that his loyalty to the crown was his greatest asset. But that blind loyalty and obedience had started his descent.And it had destroyed everything.”But when Celaena walked out, leaving that damning will behind him, he didn’t even make it to his own room. He barely made it into an empty broom closet before the sobs hit.””But he could do this for her. Even if he never saw her again, even if she abandoned her duties as King’s Champion and stayed with the Fae in Wendlyn forever – as long as he knew that she was safe, that no one could hurt her … He’d sell his soul again and again for that.”Dorian:”You have power in you, Prince. More power than you realize.” She touched his chest, tracing a symbol there, too, and some of the court ladies gasped. But Nehemia’s eyes were locked on his. “It sleeps,” she whispered, tapping his heart. “In here. When the time comes, when it awakens, do not be afraid.” She removed her hand and gave him a sad smile. “When it is time, I will help you.”My charming and precious cutiepie!!!I love Dorian so damn much! He’s the best thing about the entire series and in“Crown of Midnight”he broke my heart. I suffered with him throughout the entire book and I really hate the idea that Sarah might make him a second Lucien. Neither of those two boys deserved what she put them through and I really hope she won’t continue to harm him in the next book. He’s just too pure for the world and he needs to be protected at all costs!!! Plus he’s amazing!!!I love the fact that he has raw magic in him and I see so much potential for the next few books! Still, his loneliness caused my heart to ache and I felt really sorry for him. He’s so alone and no one is there to help him, yet his first thought when he discovered that he had magic was that he needs to find out if his brother has it too. He wanted to protect Hollin and that’s so damn sweet! <33 Oh boy, how much I wanted to hug him when he frantically tried to hide his research in the library or when he was looking for Nehemia and waited in front of Celaena’s rooms. All this anger and despair - He doesn’t deserve it!!! Sarah, please have mercy on him!!!#TeamDorian forever and for always!!!!”How long have you been yearning for him? Was what he really wanted to ask. Damn him for caring. Damn him for every moment he’d spent with her.””How about you spend a year in Calaculla, and when you’re done, you two can sit here and tell me about your plans for expansion.””Something invisible slammed into the creature, sending it flying into the wall with a crunch. Gods. Dorian didn’t just have magic – he had raw magic. The rarest, and deadliest, kind. Sheer undiluted power, capable of being shaped into whatever form the wielder desired.”Nehemia:”I won’t deny that you have suffered, Elentiya, but there are thousands more who have also suffered – and suffered more. And they do not sell themselves to the king to get what they, too, deserve. With each person you kill, I am finding fever and fewer excuses for remaining your friend.”WHY SARAH!!!??Why did you have to kill Nehemia? She was such a lovely character and I didn’t expect her death! When Celaena found out about the King’s intentions I really thought that she’d be able to safe her or would at least come just in time to exchange some final words with her. But no! We found a dead Nehemia and Celaena never got a chance to fix things between them. T_T I hate it that they had an argument before she died and I really don’t like the way Nehemia had to die. I mean she didn’t even get a fighting scene. We’re presented with a fait accompli, which sucked! Well, at least in my opinion. So there’s that! Can’t say I feel sorry for Grave or Archer though. They had it coming and they should have known better than to mess with Celaena. *lol*”I have grown up knowing the weight of my crown. When the king invaded Eyllwe all those years ago, I knew that I would someday have to make choices that would haunt me.” She cupped her forehead in a palm. “I didn’t think it would be this hard. I cannot be in two places at once.””Nehemia was gone. That vibrant, fierce, loving soul; the princess who had been called the Light of Eyllwe; the woman who had been a beacon of hope – just like that, as if she were no more than a wisp of candlelight, she was gone.””But no matter what I did, Elentiya, I want you to know that in the darkness of the past ten years, you were one of the bright lights for me. Do not let that light go out.”Kaltain and Roland:”Sometimes,” Kaltain said softly, and Celaena paused. “Sometimes I think they brought me here. Not to marry Perrington, but for another purpose. They want to use me.”I still don’t know what the king plans with Kaltain and Roland but whatever it is, it can’t be good! That thing in the dungeons underneath the clock tower was so creepy and I really don’t even want to know what else is locked up there! *shudders* There’s no doubt the King of Adarlan is up to something and I’m kind of worried about Kaltain’s fate. I have no idea where and how Roland comes into play, but I get the slight feeling he’s allied with the king. I mean yeah he helped Dorian but maybe that was all show? Who knows? I’ll definitely watch those two closely from now on. ;-)""They encourage the crows to fly past here,"" Kaltain murmured, more to herself than to Celaena. ""And my headaches are worse every day. Worse and worse, and full of all those flapping wings.""The friendships & ships:Celaena & Dorian:”She deserved a loyal, brave knight who saw her for what she was and did not fear her. And he deserved someone who would look at him like that, even if the love wouldn’t be the same, even if the girl wouldn’t be her.So Dorian closed his eyes, and took another long breath. And when he opened his eyes, he let her go.”Those two!!!I know they had troubles at the beginning but the friendship that formed between them is so perfect!!! I’m so happy that they were able to settle their differences and I love Dorian for letting her go! This was such a powerful scene and I’m so glad they eventually managed to become friends again! I loved it when Dorian told Celaena that she will always have a place with him and that she could come to his dorms whenever she needed something.THATis friendship!!!THATis trust!!! Oh gosh, I really hope Sarah won’t crush this again! *lol*”Their eyes met and held. A line stretched taut between them – a moment of trust, and a promise of answers from both of them.””But looking at Dorian as he smiled at her, this prince who was smart and thoughtful and kind, who inspired good men like Chaol to serve him …Celaena wondered if Nehemia’s impossible, desperate dream of that court might yet come to pass.””Thank you for all that you have done for me, Dorian. Thank you for being my friend. For not being like the others.” He paused, turning to face her. She kept her chin high, but her eyes were gleaming.“I’ll come back,” she said quietly. “I’ll come back for you.”Dorian & Chaol:Dorian’s lips were pursed, his face stony as he quietly said, “I’ve been busy, too.” The Crown Prince turned his horse away, heading in another direction, but paused. “Chaol,” he said, looking over his shoulder. Dorian’s eyes were frozen, his jaw clenched. “Treat her well.”*sigh* Their friendship suffered so much in this book and I really wish this wouldn’t have happened. I loved that they were so close and could talk about everything, but I guess now that Celaena got into their way things between them might never be the same again. >_< It’s sad that Dorian can’t tell Chaol about his powers but I definitely understand why he’s so cautious. I mean Chaol was always so damn loyal to the king and that actually makes it more than just hard to trust him. If I’d be in Dorian’s situation, I wouldn’t tell him as well. =(”Dorian could have gleefully killed Chaol’s father for disowning him, refusing even to see Chaol when he brought his family to Rifthold for an important meeting with the king. Even though Chaol had never said it, Dorian knew the scars went deep.”Celaena & Chaol:”I know you can look after yourself. But I worry because I care. Gods help me, I know I shouldn’t, but I do. So I will always tell you to be careful, because I will always care what happens.”I can’t believe Sarah used 1 ½ books to build this relationship and then decided to thoroughly sink the ship! Oh wait! I actuallyCANbelieve it! *LOL* After reading ACOTAR nothing should surprise me anymore! Still, I mean I never was the biggest fan of this ship (everyone who read my review of ToG knows that) but I at least would have wanted them to be happy for a while. And the way it happened!!I can understand that Celaena was angry at Chaol but I really didn’t get why she acted the way she did. I mean at first she’s all in love with Chaol and jumps to his rescue because he’s been kidnapped and all she wants is to save him becauseshe loves him oh so muchand then in the next moment she’s at his throat and almost kills him! Hell! She didn’t even give him a chance to explain himself! Yes, I’m aware this would have changed nothing about Nehemia’s death, but I think if she would have let him talk, she’d have realised that he didn’t know about the king’s plans. She wronged poor Chaol so much and even though he made bad decisions I still feel sorry for him. Because let’s face it, he might have never trusted Celaena but he certainly loved her deeply. T_TWhat a shipwreck!!!RIP!”She knew his every move and he knew hers, as though they’d been dancing this waltz together all their lives. Faster, never faltering, never breaking her stare.The rest of the world quieted into nothing. In that moment, after ten long years, Celaena looked at Chaol and realized she was home.””It had snuck up on him, this pain and terror and rage at the thought of anyone else with her. Every look, every word from her … He didn’t even know when it had started.””But he didn’t know how to get her in line. He didn’t know how to fix what had been broken. Both inside her, and between them.”All told I really loved“Crown of Midnight”and I can’t wait to dive into“Heir of Fire.”Since this was another buddy read with myprecious GemI actually enjoyed the experience even more! XD I loved our discussions about the plot and characters and the fact Gem is such a hardcore Chaol fan only addedfire to the fuelto the fun. *lol*Let’s pick up book 3 soon!!! I promise I won’t talk bad about Chaol! Well, I’ll try not to! Scout’s honor! ;-P'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is how you write a fantasy novel. Great characters, development, evolution, and revelations. Magic used intelligently, and my personal favourite action. I could not put the book down. I like the way that they characters have their responsibilities and jobs, but that is not all that defines them. Celaena has no problem hacking up body parts, but she is still a girl who loves to shop. I think even though she is an assassin, she sees herself as more of an avenger. She will avenge her friends no matter the cost.The story Celaena Sardothien won the right to become the King\'s Champion (personal Assassin) since then, she has been charged with dispatching a number of his enemies. In many cases, she brings back trophies in the form of severed heads and family insignias (rings) still attached to the hands. However, having no love for the King she has been, she has been helping his enemies get away and fake their deaths. The problem is she is too good at it, and even her closest friends and biggest supporters believe she has completely turned over to the dark side. Then she is given a target who intersected with her former life in Assassins Keep (Archer), a courtesan (prostitute). This simple assignment sends a ripple effect affecting Celaena and everyone she cares about. They also fill in some history; there is a more detailed account of what Celaena did the day she ""snapped"" in Endovier. There are also hints that Celaena knows exactly who betrayed her. In the next book I am begging for a showdown with the King of Assassins, but so far Celaena has already made enough enemies to keep her busy for a good long time, which is great news for a long series. The only thing I did find annoying in this book is the right characters suddenly appearing exactly the right moment, but will all the fate and prophecies in the book, this could be easily explained.I am a fan of Sarah\'s writing style, having chapters of different lengths, and almost chunking the chapters so information is easy to take in and break up for me. This might be a fairy tale setting but that is where the similarities stop, this is more the grim story tales type of book, with grizzly deaths, torcher, and harsh language (even though the characters do not swear in print, they usually ""unleash a string of curse""). I love the Throne of Glass universe. There are references made to not only the first novel but the eBook prequels as well.This book is a lot more action packed to the first novel, there HUGE revelations about Celaena and Dorian, (who have a Luke and Leia type relationship), as well as the forces that are using them. It\'s a great book. Start it, and you will not be able to put it down. You do not need to have read the previous stories to enjoy this one, but they do help, and after reading this one, you will want to go back and read the others.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '2.5 starsAnswer me something. How can this—""She tipped her head back and gave the moon a wicked smile. She\'d been called Adarlan\'s assassin for a reason. Dramatic entrances were practically her art form.""—and this—""Curled on the couch beside Chaol, Calaena took a sip of her tea and frowned. ""Can\'t you hire a servant like Philippa, so we can have someone bring us treats?""—possibly be the same person?I teetered between liking and hating Calaena while reading. Mostly hating. I can handle the shoes and shopping because a girl has the right to look damn good while disemboweling enemies. (Fun fact: Calaena finally acts like a real assassin in this installment)But leaving her post todance?I\'m going to say it one more time to let it sink in. The world\'sgreatest assassinleft. Her. Fucking. Post. To. Dance.It\'s such a transparent attempt to squeeze in a moonlit waltz between Chaol and Calaena, I want to laugh.I\'m Team Dorian, by the way. Just putting that out there. Chaol is an overprotective fucknuckle who can suck it.Calaena still does stupid crap, like exploring without backup or sufficient research. Her obsession with chocolate cake is goddamn annoying. It\'s too cutesy and feels like Maas\'s trying too hard. Each time it came up, I felt like paraphrasing Amy fromGone Girl: No one fucking likes chocolate cake that much.Midway, as I was finally warming up to Calaena, she turns into an uber Mary Sue.She\'s part Fae, the lost queen of Terrasen, and has magical powers. For fuck\'s sake. Choose one, Maas. Don\'t be greedy.I originally warmed up to Calaena because of Maas\'s excellent portrayal of loss and depression. It\'s not resolved in a chapter or two; it\'s an underlining theme that affects the latter half of the book. I especially like thatCalaena doesn\'t forgive Chaol right away. Nehemia dying wasn\'t his fault, but her anger and distrust is justified.I also liked Dorian\'smagicsubplot. It\'s one of the few things in Crown of Midnight that made me sit up, and partially why I think he\'d be good with Calaena: ice and fire.He\'s a way better love interestandfriend. I don\'t care if it\'s planet-aligning true love, you don\'t sneak around with your best friend\'s ex-girlfriend. *cough*Chaol*cough* I especially like the part where Dorian sees them dancing and chooses to let her go. It was a sweet, poignant moment. And put me firmly on his side, even though I\'m destined to lose.Ah, well.A Court of Thorns and Rosesis amazing and I will definitely check out anything else Maas writes, but this series is a disappointing mess.My review of Throne of GlassMy review of Heir of FireMy review of Queen of Shadows'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""upon reread, ive decided to bump up my rating. knowing how the story plays out over the span of 7 books, its allowed me to view this with a different perspective. when i first read this, i didnt like how much page-time is focused on boring history, but now i can really appreciate all of the top-notch foreshadowing thats going on.everything else in my original review still applies.___________________________firstly, wow! i think this might be better than the first book! and i actually really liked'throne of glass,'so thats saying something!secondly, i saw a status update the other day where someone expressed their frustration with how women in novels, specifically YA, are too often portrayed as fierce and dangerous. while i agree that kindness and gentleness should also be represented, i have to say that ilivefor my ruthless and downright deadly ladies.for me, reading about celaena, about an assassin, is insight into a world i would never experience in a million years. i dont have a violent bone in my body. i actually think my body is programmed with a ‘flight and flight’ response. so i love being able to experience what its like for someone to have so much conviction that she would literally kill for what she believed in. that is the beauty of books, my friends.so give me a merciless assassin any day of the week. you go, girl! see ya in book #3!↠4.5 stars""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'SO GOOD.

The second installment doth not disappoint! Our heroine is back as the King\'s Champion so expect action galore. Hear ye, hear ye . . .Her lovely dresses and ornate clothes were gone, replaced with an unforgiving, close-cut black tunic and pants. Her hair pulled back in a long braid that fell into the folds of that dark cloak she was always wearing. She was a beautiful wrath …This book turned up in my room dressed in dark robes, whispered the first few sentences like a secret incantation and before I could utter\'By the Wyrd\'I was under its spell (not saying that this book has magical powers, but this book has magical powers . . . in fact I\'m pretty sure Sarah J.

I am, as we speak, arranging to become a fictional character so I canstalkmeet you.The Captain of the Guard is as strong and fierce as he was in ToG but in this installment we get to see more of his softer side. The beautiful friendship between Celaena and him takes front stage in CoM. Sarah really takes the opportunity to flesh out their relationship in all it\'s banter-teasing-tension glory. There\'s talk of books(sigh)and late nights spent next to the fireplace.While Chaol\'s compassion and loyalty are beacons of light in the darkness of the Royal Court, the question is where exactly do his loyalties lie?

Shocking isn\'t it that boys can experience the same emotions as female heroines(cough)?\xa0Sarah doesn\'t kick him to the curb either. Rather another layer of mystery is added when strange things start happening to him . . . things that put his life at risk.The most refreshing aspect of this trio\'s relationship is that Celaena is not turned into a Mary Sue mess in the face of these male ""interests."" Four for you Sarah J. Maas.I am not at all done with these characters and I\'m ready for their next adventure. CoM had it all:magic, adventure, epic fights, romance, mysteryandsecrets. . . so many dirty little secrets that aren\'t as neatly tucked into the nooks and crannies of the Royal Court as their owners would like to think.

Dear lord wilt thou not grant patience to my poor shipper heart?!TeamshirtlessChaol.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Esto es una maravilla.Hacía mucho tiempo que un libro no me ""llenaba"" de esta forma. El estilo de Sarah J Maas no es el más complejo del mundo, pero tampoco es una lectura sencilla y ligera. Sin embargo,consigue que me trague hasta el más mínimo punto para descubrir cada detalle(exceptuando cómo se viste Celaena, que me da un poco igual).La manera en la que Maas consigue sumergirte en la historia es espectacular, incluso con personajes que te puedan caer mal. Simplemente estás enganchado y quieres saber más y más.Vamos viendo en esta segunda parte de la serieTrono de Cristalcómorealmente hemos estado un poco engañadxs.A ver, yo sabía que había más... cosas, pero la forma en la que la historia va evolucionando está muy bien hecha. Sí, comenzamos con una esclava/asesina profesional y su propia venganza para el rey que acabó con la vida de tantos inocentes. Y sí, ella es despiadada y tiene un plan, y sabe sabotear al monarca.Pero tenemos siempre como ruido de fondo la magia, la extinción de esta, las Marcas de Wyrd, tierras lejanas que amenazan con rebelarse... Y ese ruido de fondo poco a poco va ganando fuerza.¿Esto es una historia sobre las clases sociales en un mundo de alta fantasía o... es otra cosa?EnCorona de medianocheveremos cómo las tornas cambian,y que el tema simplista de ser asesina se va entremezclando con otras cosas mucho más interesantes, profundas y mágicas. Es una muy buena transición, aunque sé que vendrán cosas más increíbles.Esta saga tiene algo que engancha mucho, y es que la protagonista nada entre dos aguas.A veces, no son tan claras, pero en otras ocasiones sí.Dorian. Chaol. Son dos caras de la misma moneda, ¿o no?Yo como lector no dejaba de preguntarme qué pasaba por sus cabezas, y aunque a veces tenemos una breve mirada hacia ellas, me siguen pareciendo enigmáticos y misteriosos. Y honestamente, es difícil decidirse.No me cae mal ninguno de ellos(incluso hablando de traiciones, como en este libro), porque siento que son personajes demasiado atados a sus actuales condiciones de vida, actuando lo mejor que pueden dentro de un marco opresivo que les ahoga. ¿Cuál es la decisión correcta en un mundo corrupto de por sí?Me gusta muchísimo cómo se plantean sus conflictos morales y personales para con Celaena o el reino de Adarlan.Como ya he comentado,el estilo de Sarah es cautivador. Engancha muchísimo, pese a no ser una lectura sencilla.Ni las palabras, ni la forma de narrar son algo propio de una novela pensada para ser adictiva y ya está. Tiene un componente muy literario, de profundidad, de lentitud, pero nunca deja de contar cosas. Todo lo que narra sirve para algo, incluso la mínima tontería que menciona de refilón.La forma en la que el misterio es planteado en torno a Elena, su Ojo y las Marcas de Wyrd me ha dejado con el culo torcido.Es un constante ""creo que va a ir por aquí"", pero termina yendo en la dirección opuesta, y luego te sorprende aún más, y sigues descubriendo más y más cosas que no te esperas. Honestamente, unas cartas muy bien jugadas.No entiendo, por cierto, el odio que algunas personas le tienen a Celaena Sardothien. ¡NO LO ENTIENDO!Me parece uno de los personajes más complejos de la literatura juvenil actual. Y es que no solo es compleja, sino bien construida, y además -que es lo más importante- no es buena. Tiene su parte mala, vengativa, llena de malicia. Que lo use para lo que tú consideres el bien o el mal es otra cosa, pero sus decisiones se basan en, sí, por qué no, momentos calientes o llenos de rabia. Y no hay nada malo en ello: es una maldita asesina.Me parece que tiene una personalidad clara y perfectamente dibujada. Es inteligente y llena de poder para engañar, que es un soplo de aire fresco entre tanto personaje heroico o \'bueno\'.Corona de medianochenos habla más y mejor de la historia de este universo. EnTrono de Cristalteníamos una buena introducción a ello, pero aquí, descubriendo más sobre el pasado y la magia que habitaba este continente, observamos que hay mucho más que contar y descubrir.Que si el Reino de las Brujas, el circo con Piernas Amarillas, los dioses antiguos, llaves mágicas...

I have to confess, even with the popular opinion being the series getting better with each book, I had my doubts. I couldn\'t imagine the author breaking away from her original portrayer of Celaena considerably. So, though she was more or less the same, it came as a pleasant surprise, to see she is now sharing the story with two other POVs. Though the Crown of Midnight was not a huge improvement, this is certainly a step in right direction.""Some of the things you hear with your ears. Others, you hear with your heart.""Aside from having multiple POVs, there isn\'t a whole lot different about this book: writing style, world building, characters, are nearly identical to the first, and moves along the same plot. And the first half did make me think this second book was not improved at all compared to the first. But then, right around the halfway point, an incident completely changed things, which led to a highly eventful, and entertaining second half. All the characters went through some dramatic changes after this point, and finally brought down some of Celaena\'s conflicting (and annoying) character traits. I also appreciate the use of multiple POVs. I know this would probably change in future, but in this second book, I think Dorian was my favorite character. But after how the author changes the characters\' actions spontaneously(like Chaol\'s), I wouldn\'t be surprised to see that change in future books.""You\'d be surprised how easily men see what they want to see.""The underlying plot of the story is still not clear, even by the end of this second book. But considering there are seven book in this series, I guess it would be this way, at least until the fourth or fifth book. Hopefully, the plotlines would be streamlined soon enough, so that the final books will not have a lot of loose ends. Overall, I liked the second book more than the first, and for me, it earned a complete star (from 2.5-stars to 3.5), and I\'m hoping to see the growth consistent.""You must learn to ask the right questions before you can receive right answers.""'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'sjm did Nehemia so dirty in this book'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'InfinityI love this series with all of my heart until the end of time stars!! ♾️⭐❝ The best lies were always mixed with truth. ❞❝ Sometimes you have to break before you can become something new . ❞❝ But death was her curse and her gift, and death had been her good friend these long, long years. ❞Well, to be honest...

Deadly consequences… Bestselling sensation Juniper Song is not who she says she is, she didn’t write the book she claims she wrote, and she is most certainly not Asian American—in this chilling and hilariously cutting novel from R.F. Kuang, the #1 New York Times bestselling author ofBabel.Authors June Hayward and Athena Liu were supposed to be twin rising stars. But Athena’s a literary darling. June Hayward is literally nobody. Who wants stories about basic white girls, June thinks.So when June witnesses Athena’s death in a freak accident, she acts on impulse: she steals Athena’s just-finished masterpiece, an experimental novel about the unsung contributions of Chinese laborers during World War I.So what if June edits Athena’s novel and sends it to her agent as her own work? So what if she lets her new publisher rebrand her as Juniper Song—complete with an ambiguously ethnic author photo? Doesn’t this piece of history deserve to be told, whoever the teller? That’s what June claims, and the New York Times bestseller list seems to agree.But June can’t get away from Athena’s shadow, and emerging evidence threatens to bring June’s (stolen) success down around her. As June races to protect her secret, she discovers exactly how far she will go to keep what she thinks she deserves.With its totally immersive first-person voice, Yellowface grapples with questions of diversity, racism, and cultural appropriation, as well as the terrifying alienation of social media. R.F. Kuang’s novel is timely, razor-sharp, and eminently readable.","[{'rating': 2, 'content': '2.5/5i feel weird writing this review. for one, Yellowface isn’t out until next year. two, the book is very meta about twitter and book reviews—ratings on goodreads even make up several important plot points. i feel like me and the book are engaging in some inside joke.i’ve decided not to include any quotes from the book and talk in general terms with minor details to avoid spoilers (not anything that’s not in the premise, anyway), but i’m still talking about how i felt about different parts of the book, including the middle and end, even though I won’t be talking about what happens in them. so if you want to go in blind, beware. i know this runs the risk of me describing something one way, but then you going and reading it and interpreting a different way, but until it actually comes out and i can drop the ‘extended’ (and hopefully more sophisticated) review, this will have to do.yellowface is meant to be drama and dark satire. it’s a bit hilariously grim and grimly hilarious to anyone who’s ever needed to close booktwt and touch grass, but also interesting to anyone moderately familiar with books, writing or publishing. the prose isn’t babel, where i was stopping every page to savour the writing style, but it is fast-paced and fairly easy to get through. and i’m kind of torn about yellowface, but the worst part is that i can’t figure out whether it’s in a “this didn\'t work for me, personally” way, or a more objective “this is a Critique” way.my problem with yellowface comes down to the fact that i cannot separate the narrative voice from rfk’s voice at all. a lot of the experiences of a certain character lines up very much with what i know is rfk’s own, and that is on purpose and not necessarily bad—she’s an author who’s always been very open about putting a lot of herself into her books and it’s one of the things that can add to their emotional depth. a lot of readers will likely proclaim the fact you can’t unsee the hand of the author in the writing is The Point. however, when the characters start to receive criticisms that are very similar to criticisms rfk has faced, but represented somewhat flatly, i cock my head a bit. see: problematic representation of Taiwanese indigenous people (a criticism in isolation that depnding on the book may be valid, but in yellowface is shown to be made by people who are just jealous of the author and don’t actually know what they’re talking about), privately-educated, rich western diaspora writing about traumatic histories of working classes from the homelands they’ve only visited a few times (a criticism in isolation that depending on the author may be valid, but in yellowface is made from the perspective of the racist white woman using it to justify her horrible actions), etc.this may not bother other readers, but i can’t help but side-eye it. she gets around it by having these criticisms be made by mouthpieces—that’s another thing about yellowface, by the way.so many mouthpieces.i don’t think this is a book where readers will get very attached to the characters, not just because the mc is an unreliable narrator, but because yellowface is more of a book where characters are tools that represent different things and perspectives and are meant to be grimly watched, observed and laughed at from above. which is mostly fun, until you start to distinguish between rfk’s mouthpieces a bit: which ones she represents more flatly and more caricatured, and the one she gives more nuanced paragraphs to, from under which i think I can make out the haze of her opinions. and i’m not fond of them all the time.as always, it’s certainly interesting, but the middle of the book is basically all twitter discourse. it had me wondering if i could just scroll through my timeline and get the same experience instead. it’s veryyy meta—sometimes fun, sometimes obnoxious. maybe it’s too ‘high concept’ for me, sorry, or maybe it\'s heavy-handed. and it makes my job writing this difficult, because how much can i attribute to the unreliable narrator, satirical style or rfk herself? where does one end and the other begin, if they do so at all?(which was a big thing that irked me with tpw. people would make criticisms of rfk\'s narrative choices and plot points and the response would be ‘well, rin is an unreliable narrator!’ yes, but there is such thing asframingandcontextwhich are important things to consider when trying to figure out what an author actually is saying, intentionally or not. but anyways.)speaking of slightly more well-written unreliable narrators, juniper song is… a character. more of an awful ball of jealous, racist, liberal misery who you get to follow the entertaining downward spiral of throughout the book than a person. at least, when she\'s not hindered by rfk\'s blunt writing style striking her on the head. the commentary and discussion yellowface wants to have about publishing and racism is genuinely interesting and important, but I enjoyed yellowface most when it doing less back-and-forth with its own themes and more about the fucked up relationship between athena liu and juniper song/june hayward/athena liu. ie,when it was more about actual people than rfk\'s comemntary.despite athena dying at the very start of the story, she haunts the narrative, sometimes through flashbacks, sometimes through other people’s experiences, sometimes literally. and the narrativeisjuniper. i love a good fucked up friendship/rivalry/impersonation?/whatever the fuck this is. there\'s a flashback where we find out about a fucked up thing athena did regarding a traumatic event juniper went through--something which in no way justifies the scale of what juniper does throughout the book, but muddies the waters and makes everyone involved seem like more flawed, three-dimensional people. keyword, people! and whenever that relationship had the spotlight, i couldn’t put yellowface down. it\'s insane the narrative spent more time on its self-indulgent satire than it does on its genuinely compelling emotional core.which is why i was really loving the third act, in which a lot of my criticisms seemed to fall away and the mess of the premise was really coming to a head. i was reading it late at night and, even though it’s not a horror, i got actually creeped out by several parts. to be honest, if yellowface had stuck the landing, it could have been four stars.and that’s my final problem with yellowface. it has a decent plot, interesting cast of characters, interesting themes and discussions, but my only feeling on the ending was,‘…that’s it?’i know i said i wouldn’t do quotes, but im making an exception for the bit where our narrator says,‘I’ve written myself into a corner. The first two thirds of the book were a breeze to compose, but what do i do with the ending? Where do I leave my protagonist, now that there’s no clear resolution?’Which is very meta, because based off the ending, i feel that’s the position rfk was in at that exact point. i can somewhat tell she struggled with where to take the ending and i have more thoughts on why i felt underwhelmed by it, but i guess that’ll be for 2023, for when it\'s no doubt on all the \'Very Important Books of the Year\' lists. for now, i can see myself rereading babel and parts of tpw, but i don’t see myself rereading yellowface.it\'s now 2023. in short, the ending is less a bang, and more of a whimper. rfk rules out a geoff-style ending for june, someone who disappears quietly from public memory after the scandal and becomes old news. she\'s too attached to athena\'s image. this is the right choice--june is too much of a villain-protagonist to get an unearned, \'soft\' ending at the end of this. but then the \'crash-and-burn\' ending needed to be a lot more to be satisfying for me. we get hallucinations, suicidal ideation, her isolating herself from her support network, all of this building and building and building--and then it goes...nowhere.oh, we get a fascinating final confrontation with candace, one of athena\'s fellow asian-american authors, who gets to deliver the most cutting, messy and brutal line of the book:""Who gives a fuck about Athena? Fuck Athena. We all hated that bitch. This is for me.""but what happens after?we get a prediction from june, which is basically that the cycle of controvery and scandal that this whole book has shown us for however many hundreds of pages will just keep going, and going, and going, and maybe june will win (at least in her eyes). it\'s just such a nothing ending. sure, it\'s #commentary and a criticism of the publishing and media industry, but that does not make it satisfying. it\'s not an emotional resolution, and it\'s not even a more sophisticated commentary on the cyclical nature of scandal and how white people don’t face consequences than what the story has shown us already. we\'veseenthe cycle and her getting away with it. the whole book so far has been the cycle and her getting away with it. i think it\'s a good example of what i\'ve been saying, to be honest, about how yellowface is more about The Point than any story it\'s trying to tell. The ending is all about The Point, but is not an emotional resolution to anything developed or a conclusion to any charater arcs. just ""and this will continue, because doesn\'t it always continue? isn\'t this ending so clever?"" the worst part is that itteasesyou with the prospect of something more compelling: june plays with the idea of \'accidentally\' killing candace and knowing she would get away with it because she\'s a white woman, a horrific mirror to the start of the book and a sign of june\'s complete downward spiral, because at least Athena\'s death was an actual accident (and would be a frankly brutal commitment to the “they always get away with it” message). in a different moment, it makes you wonder if june may even be the one who might die an accidental death and now candace is the one to continue this twisted cycle, a horribly circular but somewhat karmic ending. instead, the cycle continues... in the most uninspired way possible. the third act of yellowface feels like it\'s hurtling towards a great ending and then face-plants over the finish line at the last minute. despite being a protagonist who is more well-suited for a crash-and-burn ending than any other i\'ve read, juniper song doesn\'t burn. she barely sizzles. and to me, that\'s disappointing.trigger warnings for this book: racism, c slur, suicidal ideation, sexual assaultedit 24/05/2023:unsurprisingly, some people on twitter cannot fucking read, so to clarify some things: 1)i am not white. i am asian,2) I DO NOT CARE THAT JUNE WAS IRREDEEMABLE. I DID NOT WANT A REDEMPTION FOR A RACIST. my main problem was that i found the way yellowface handled its themes came at the cost of other aspects of the story when it should have been making them better. 3) ""[insert criticism here] is literally the whole point of the story omgggg how could you miss the point so bad did you even pass english lit in school etc etc."" personally, i do not enjoy 300 pages of on-the-nose commentary through uncompelling mouthpieces. i especially find it questionable when some of these mouthpieces flatly reflect criticisms the authors has actually received in regards to her previous work. if you do, more power to you! if what i disliked about the book is what you enjoyed about it, well, that\'s just how having an opinion works. i don\'t know what to tell you. i can definitely understand how someone who isn\'t as aware of some of the meta-commentary would have more enjoyment. but i find the response that i ""missed the point"" (to be honest, the writing constantly tries its best to be Desperately Sure You Are Not Missing The Point) that this book is about racism by some white readers when i\'m intimately familiar with racism, both as it pertains to real life and in media, kind of... well. racist.in a way, i guess this book is perfect for booktwitter. a lot of recognisable discourse where the Message and Themes are written out for you in big bold letters, constantly, all the time, throughout the story, just in case you missed it—that way, even your average reading-comprehension-starved twitter user can pick up on it—padded with enough relatable material about being chronically online and plenty of fictional ragebait to distract from a narrative that can’t get its teeth into its own premise and a third act that can’t deliver. target audience acquired.in line with the theme of the book, i’m going to completely steal another reviewer’s words that i can’t stop thinking about.\'the problem with kuang is that, despite a reputation for in-depth research, she refuses to interrogate beyond her scope.\'go read it. and i’d like to add to that: a lot of her most avid readers don’t have the appetite for anything beyond that, either. and take it incredibly personally when at the end of the meal, you’re still hungry.and to be clear, this isn\'t a blanket response to everyone who disagrees with me (i\'ve had interesting conversations with people who do)--just to some people who are determined to take the most uncharitable opinion possible of a frankly lukewarm review.a book can be about an important subject matter and i can still feel it fell short of what it was trying to do. that is not me putting personal attack on the author, the author\'s identity, the subject matter itself, or any readers who enjoyed the book or their identities. i didn\'t even hate the book. i liked parts of it quite a bit. i just wanted more.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '‘Don’t ghosts just want to be remembered?’A book about fucking around and finding out.The question of who should or shouldn’t tell a story has been a hotly debated subject, a discourse that must also recognize the playing field is guided by rules of capitalism in a for-profit publishing industry and a social climate that prods “culture wars” to increase clicks. Still in recent memory are the debates overAmerican Dirt, which sparkedmonths of controversyover white authors using another’s cultural narrative as what many considered “trauma porn,” but also over the publisher’s decision to throw incredible amounts of marketing money at this book when immigration stories by authors living within the culture were being passed over for that novel. R.F. Kuang’sYellowfacesinks its teeth into the world of publishing and the discourses on authenticity through the eyes of June Hayward, a white woman who has taken the draft of a Chinese-American woman’s novel and published it as her own. She will forever be haunted by this choice, like a Lady Macbeth of letters haunted by bloodstains in her attempt to usurp the kingdom. It is a perfect follow-up toBabeland the conversations on how language can be a form of colonialism, though this one has no magical elements like the former. Instead,Yellowfacereads like a scandal unfolding before your eyes and transfixes the reader with all the sick satisfactions that keep us scrolling through social media debates and keep hot takes. Kuang makes us sit with our discomfort, through an excellent choice of an unreliable narrator, and forces us to confront our own opinions on the matter. With a sharp critique on the commodification and consumption of art in publishing and reviewing (even Goodreaders are not spared here), a look at online debates, the self-aggrandizing aspects of social media, and the way artists are pitted against each other as if writing was a competitive sport, Kuang’sYellowfaceasks big questions on authenticity and identity in a society that has reduced the concepts into marketing metrics.I’ll be honest, I read this book in a single sitting. I could not look away, and Kuang’s writing sweeps you up in it’s conversational cadance. While I’ve enjoyed Kuang’s writing previously,Yellowfacefeels very polished and matured, the novel reading with the ease and eagerness of a tell-all memoir, which is the framing of the story. As a fictional memoir, it drops a lot of pop culture references to key into a specific time. Kuang’s choice of perspective through June—who rebrands at the request of her publisher as Juniper Song, Song being her middle-name but also nudges readers to think she may have Chinese heritage—is brilliant as it allows us to feel the floor-dropping-out discomfort of becoming the focus of internet rage as well as navigate a vigorous criticism of the publishing industry. Kuang is able to cover issues without moralizing, making the reader sift through alternating opinions that are likely to expose their own assumptions and discomforts, and we must always remember the telling is often guiding us away from judging her and towards everyone else. With a big confession at the center, June can manipulate the reader on smaller issues and in a way it becomes a rather metafictional approach to the way storytelling is just that: fictionalizing stories.Kuang does well by creating a character that isn’t entirely unsympathetic—we need to want to keep reading her take on the events—and hate reading is a shallow effect that evaporates quickly. Not unlike the social media scandals that hit viciously and are forgotten days later. Not that June is innocent, and being disgusted with her is half the fun, but Kuang will force us to consider what exactly it is that disgusts us and what that means in a larger context about art and the commodification of it. We���ve seen these sorts of scandals, such as a personal favorite bizarre tale of Natalie Beach who wrote about beingthe ghostwriter for Caroline Calloway, or last year’sWho Is the Bad Art Friend?article concerning Sonya Larson and Dawn Dorland where everyone seemed to be too thrilled by the mess to not pick a side. Though the story that seems closest toYellowfaceis the one surroundingKristen Roupenian’s short storyCat Person(you canread it here) which was defended then later attacked whenan article revealing the details was taken from a strangers real life, told to the author by the man who was fictionalized in the story as the sex pest and later committed suicide in real life. Twitter was full of well-known authors debating if personal details and stories of others are always fair game, even though the hometown and place of employment of the girl was not changed for the published version (my college roommate later rented the house Roupenian had previously lived in and describes in story). Literary twitter was confronted with a situation about what level of authenticity is appropriate and can someone tell someone else’s story.The way social media fuels a fire is at the heart of this story, with twitter challenging authenticity and morals at all times. Which becomes a tragic interplay at the way authors are demanded to be vulnerable, to seek authenticity and expose their pain for book sales, yet social media loves to exploit personal details and use vulnerabilities as an opening for an attack.‘dozen, maybe hundreds, maybethousandsof strangers are out there, mining your personal information, worming their ways into your life, looking for ways to mock, humiliate, or worse, endanger you. You come to regret everything you’ve ever shared about yourself…because the trollswillfind them.’We’ve all most likely criticized a stranger on social media, sometimes the pile-ups are too fun and humorous to not get a joke in, but Kuang tries to remind us that the targets are real people with real feelings. Sure, June deserves to be exposed and feel bad for what she’s done, but Kuang puts us in her shoes and lets you feel what being a target is like. Because it can come for anyone, even Athena was once the target of harassment, death threats and hacking where she didn’t feel safe all for being called a ‘race traitor’ for dating a white man. ‘In destroying her,’ June narrates the voice of social media, ‘we create an audience we create moral authority for ourselves.’ Such is the nature of social media in the state of a scandal, and all for what? ‘Allegations get flung left and right, everyone’s reputations are torn down, and when the dust clears, everything remains exactly as it was.’ Nothing changes, but, as we see in the novel, much of this is because someone profits from it. A scandal often turns into book sales (for all the complaintsAmerican Dirtwas canceled it still remained a bestseller for months) and if you keep selling books you keep getting published.‘The living are burdened with bodies. They make shadows, footprints.’But lets move to the scandal at hand. Here we have June, who has a tepid friendship with rising literary star Athena Liu. She feels jealous as well as annoyance with Athena, fantasizing how she’d like to ‘neatly peel her skin off her body like an orange and zip it up over myself,’ something she is soon metaphorically doing when she edits the now deceased Athena’s manuscript: a WW1 novel about Chinese laborers. It starts off innocently enough (or so June claims) being an exercise in editing that she gets so caught up in loving writing again that she passes it off as herself. It is titledThe Last Front, is praised for a mosaic storytelling style reminiscent of the filmDunkirkand becomes an instant bestseller. She will spend the novel fiercely defending she has the right to tell this story—sometimes being rewarded such as when speaking at a Chinese American Social Club she is thanked by a man who’s Chinese father fought in the war for making sure their stories are told—yet at the end of the day, this never was her story. And while she can be a great writer, we see she is never able to come up with her own ideas and the ones she have is derivative of other stories. It is a subtle and clever nod to a gap between being a good writer and being a good author or creator (an offer to write for existing IP disgusts her, perhaps because she is confronted by what she doesn’t want to admit is her strength).‘It all boils down to self-interest…If publishing is rigged, you might as well make sure it\'s rigged in your favor.’While the marketing grab here is definitely the idea of colonizing another’s work and culture and passing it off as your own (there are many moments for readers to fist bump the novel and say “HAHA take that shit, “Junie””) Kuang makes this a symptom of a larger issue. In her acknowledgements, Kuang states that the novel is a ‘horror story about loneliness in a fiercely competitive industry.’ If your ears perked up at horror story, therearesome horror elements late in the novel (though perhaps not enough and it could have been threaded in longer, if I have one complaint it is that the novels episodic feel never quite let individual elements breathe enough and makes the last portion feel a bit like going one step more than needed instead of flowing from the book which would have sidestepped that feeling? Maybe thats just me though). But loneliness does permeate this tale, and we see how authors can feel crushed under the way for-profit publishing makes it a competition who awards winners and losers. One author will get a huge deal and seemingly inexhaustible marketing, while another gets one small print run and no publisher support. Kuang looks at publishing as a rigged enterprise, with a small team of (mostly white) executives deciding what gets sold and more or less deciding what will be a bestseller and informing readers to follow suit. Its not a secret that publishers buy space in chain bookstores or that the Big 5 US publishers are80% of all publishing revenue. It is a market based on profit, and will be manipulated to ensure profits keep coming.‘This industry is built on silencing us, stomping us into the ground, and hurling money at white people to produce racist stereotypes of us.’To June, however, she sees diversity as a problem, thinking she is passed over for authors like Athena because it looks good. Which, if we look at the publishing market, shows that about75% of published authors in the US are whiteand a 2020 study showed95% of all books published were by white authorsthe previous year.Now everyone probably remembers 2020 was the year many corporations made pledges to be better at diversity, the publishing industry under extra scrutiny as Black authors and anti-racism books were topping the best sellers and showing there was indeed a market for such books, but lets look at the industry itself. Since then,a recent survey shows only a 1% changein the industry, with it being 83% white and that most non-white hires since 2020 are for marketing positions. Which is using “diversity” as a sales technique again.So what June see’s as a fast-track to success is actually a steep uphill climb. ‘""Do you know how much shit Athena got from this industry?’ a character remarks late in the novel, ‘They marked her as their token, exotic Asian girl. Every time she tried to branch out to new projects, they kept insisting that Asian was her brand, was what her audience expected.’ To be a brand is what publishing reduces identity into is the argument seen in the novel. And, if one is reduced to being a brand of themselves, they are now in market competition. I think of author Brandon Taylor saying identity becomes a marketing pitch, and howReal Lifewas reviewed as about identity when he says it was about lonely that happened to have explorations of identity in the book. I\'m reminded of thereasons authors pushed against #OwnVoiceslabels asBecky Albertallifelt forced to come out to ""justify"" her book and others felt boxed in by it.‘Do you know what it\'s like to pitch a book and be told they already have an Asian writer? That they can\'t put out two minority stories in the same season? That Athena Liu already exists, so you\'re redundant?’Kuang examines how the idea of being a brand exists in the outskirts of publishing as well. We have the twitter fights where people exist as a self-brand of being antagonists, we have goodreads reviewers where their brand is taking down popular authors (some lines that may sting are remarks from other authors to not read goodreads and harsh takes are more about feeding ego than worthwhile criticism), and journalists who make a brand at hot takes. However, we have to remember that June is directing us to look at howeveryone elseis the problem instead of her. So while through her telling many of the critiques are cast as villains, the fictional journalist Adele Sparks-Sato (a nod toAndrea Long ChuasVartika pointed out) is not wrong when writing that June’s version of Athena’s novel ‘joins novels likeThe HelpandThe Good Earthin a long line of what I dub historical exploitation novels: inauthentic stories that use troubled pasts as an entertaining set piece for white entertainment.’‘The appropriation of history, the historicization of the past, the narrativization of society, all of which give the novel its force, include the accumulation and differentiation of social space, space to be used for social purposes.’-Edward Said,Culture and ImperialismThere is a good deal of nuance in this book about how the commodification of art is an issue, but also a reminder that we can’t scapegoat our own actions on that entirely. There are some great little jabs in this—Junie Song ordering a Miss Saigon drink only to find it “too sweet” for her tastes—and it does emphasize the problems of representing a different culture from a western lens. AsEdward Saidwrote ‘the power to narrate, or to block other narratives from forming and emerging is very important to culture and imperialism,’ and argued that literature can be a form of colonialism by establishing a perception of a different culture or geography, and in the editing process ofThe Last Frontwe watch June make concessions on the text in order to appeal more to a white reader as requested by her publisher. Yes, she did actually do a great deal of research, and her opinion is the criticisms of cultural issues in the book are ‘exclusive cultural snobbishness and authenticity testing’ that ‘are only a form of gatekeeping,’ though later criticisms of her book are that her misunderstanding of how names or families work, or how her positions on certain issues imply a stance on current Chinese politics that are so beyond her understanding can be harmful. Some readers find it to read as a white-savioir narrative, something we know was manufactured by changing certain characters to be white characters to better fit the market needs. Which also returns us to the idea that art under capitalism will always be in service to profits.Yellowfaceby R.F. Kuang is a delightful novel with the fierceness of an unfolding scandal that makes us confront many key issues hotly debated in the literary world right now. I enjoyed the nuance here in how it exposes problems from many angles, but does not allow that to be an excuse for bad behavior. Understanding is not the same as condoning here, and it is a page-turning trip watching June dip and dodge as her usurped empire continuously threatens to crash down around her. Kuang writes with confidence and precision andYellowfacemakes for an excellent look at the literary world and the commodification of art.4.5/5‘Isn’t that what ghosts do? Howl, moan, make themselves into spectacles? That’s the whole point of a ghost, is it not? Anything to remind you that they’re still there. Anything to keep you from forgetting.’Update: I got to hear R.F. Kuang speak about the book yesterday! She was DELIGHTFUL, discussed why she dislikes how publishing turns identity into marketing metrics, the booksBeautiful World, Where Are You, Ferrante\'s Neapolitan novels and told everyone to readMurderbot. So well spoken, intelligent, and a real wonderful author.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'lmao.the frustration, as always, is that rf kuang is an intelligent and steady-handed writer. she is ahead of many of her peers in craft as much as sales: she writes a page-turner, she crafts a strong perspective, she is horror-writer good at making the reader feel gut-churning revulsion (whether or not she earns the strong emotion she likes to pull out is another question), and in this book she\'s capable of being funny. like here\'s a perfect paragraph, in which our pernicious white heroine works with her editor to chop and change the manuscript she stole:The hardest part is keeping track of all the characters. We change almost a dozen names to reduce confusion. Two different characters have the last name Zhang, and four have the last name Li. Athena differentiates them by giving them different first names, which she only occasionally uses, and other names that I assume are nicknames (A Geng, A Zhu; unless A is a last name and I’m missing something), or Da Liu and Xiao Liu, which throws me for a loop because I thought Liu was a last name, so what are Da and Xiao doing there? Why are so many of the female characters named Xiao as well? And if they’re family names, does that mean everyone is related? Is this a novel aboutincest? But the easy fix is to give them all distinct monikers, and I spend hours scrolling through pages on Chinese history and baby name sites to find names that will be culturally appropriate.like it\'s absolutely executing all of its tricks as it should: the blinkers of a close first person perspective, the legible different reality underneath. it\'s not subtle but when done in satire it\'s not AS hamhanded as kuang\'s dramatic instincts, per other books. readers who know chinese will scream, readers who don\'t will still feel their brain itch. the authorial hand is capable.the author is capable... of more than she writes. the problem with kuang is that, despite a reputation for in-depth research, she refuses to interrogate beyond her scope. in previous books that meant that the sense of history was strong and the rest of the work of writing fiction—character work, plot, tone, anything reliant on the imagination—was comparatively weak. here there\'s no research to hold it up, just kuang\'s own posting habits and career success. the step down from jstor to twitter is a violent stumble.kuang is an accomplished academic but a deeply incurious writer. that is on sharp display here, in a book that is meant to depict success and failure in the literary-commercial circuit—something that kuang knows little about. kuang is a genre writer who achieved crossover commercial success after blowing up on tiktok. her debut was promising and lauded but not uniquely vaunted; she received genre award noms (not wins) but her books blew up on tiktok after the fact and she launched an incredibly successful book this yearin the genre space, off the back of her tiktok fame. everything she knows about succeeding she knows about inside her particular bubble, and also, because she has been succeeding since she was an undergrad baby, has been told—and genuinely believes—that she has hit the summit of success. this leaves her totally inequipped to write about what literary success looks like when engineered by the house. r.f. kuang has no belief that there is a form of publishing greatness beyond that which has been bestowed upon r.f. kuang, and a wilful desire not to google further.the \'publishing details\' on display are... well, they all exist IN publishing, curate a FORM of commercial success, and are familiar to kuang, but they don\'t match the book as described here (a lit-commercial wwii doorstopper, written by a chinese-american author and butchered into commercial sentimentality by a white author and editor, think the bulletproof success of american dirt even in the thick of its cancellation). mainstream literary successes don\'t come up through pitchwars. mainstream commercial novels don\'t come up in most book box deals because there is a form of literary success that is not reliant on superfans buying multiple copies apiece. there\'s a part where our heroine lists the major american literary awards her major literary-commercial war novel is up for and starts with: the goodreads choice awards. posting FROM this bad website: please be serious. it\'s fitting that the cover looks more like a designed arc than like a book.there\'s a note in the babel prologue that i think about all the time with kuang\'s work, where she says that she was so dazzled by the sight of an oyster tower at a particular oxford party that she put it in the book even though oysters in victorian england were trash food for peasants—she didn\'t want to capture the dazzle or the waste so much as she wanted to write down her experience beat for beat, and could not conceive of an emotional reality that she did not personally live. this is an oyster tower book. this is embarrassing and technically inaccurate mimesis all the way down, solely interested in kuang\'s own interests. wow your heroines live in dc? and you lived in dc? they met at yale? you go to yale? omigod rebecca that\'s so crazy. there was a shorthand term back in the sporking days (i know, i hate my withered hag fingers for typing this too) on LIVEJOURNAL (HAG FINGERS) called \'pepper jack cheese\' that was like ""hermione ate a sandwich with pepper jack cheese (a/n: that\'s my favorite cheese!)"", the phenomenon where the author would gigglingly and obviously insert a few of their real-life favorite things into the story. kuang\'s pepper jack cheese is whistlepig whiskey, name-dropped bafflingly twice as a signifier for the nicest possible whiskey, and also every single detail.it is like. skin-crawlingly secondhand embarrassing to watch an author write their own life beat for beat and also be like \'everyone hated her because she was TOO pretty and TOO smart\'. every critique that has ever been leveled against kuang goes into the mouth of her proxy\'s haters, including the pernicious and grasping white heroine. the belief that her haters are racist comes in a distant second to the belief that her haters are jealous—of her success, of her telegenic prettiness, of her comfortable life. maybe baby but look at the material: there\'s room for improvement. it is disappointing to watch someone technically skilled grind their intellectual curiosity down to a nub via posting and self-obsession, and it\'s humiliating to watch an oxbridge-ivy phd student say \'talk to the hand! and DON\'T tell me to log off\' for three hundo pages. is this the best she can do? does SHE think this is the best she can do? i\'m worried that she does.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Whew child. Some of these reviews are doing exactly what Kuang was pointing out throughYellowface. It’s interesting to watch it happen in real time. While I don’t have extensive knowledge of her work, I think what Kuang is doing in this book is actually quite brilliant.At the most basic of levels,Yellowfaceis a mash of various genres that follows the passive aggressive “friendship” of Athena and June, two authors in the publishing industry with very different levels of success. Athena has received her big break while June has remained a struggling author. In an absurd (truly absurd if I’m being quite honest haha) turn of events, Athena chokes while engaging in a pancake eating contest with June. After her death, June makes the decision to steal one of her manuscripts and pass it off as her own. What follows next is chaotic descent into the world of publishing and the book community.What Worked:SO MUCH OF THIS BOOOK WORKED! I’ve seen the countless criticisms of Kuang inserting herself too much into this book as well as the criticisms that indicate that there isn’t much to be gained from reading this book. I wholeheartedly disagree. Oh, my friends, there is much to be gained. Neither of the characters is likeable and that is INTENTIONAL. This isn’t a way to illustrate that everyone in publishing is selfish, but a means to question how much the reader falls into the trap of engaging with the model minority myth. The expectation that Athena is supposed to be likeable is deeply woven in the sociological phenomena that stereotypes many Asian communities as successful, smart, likeable, diligent, docile, etc and the idea that Athena doesn’t fit into that role has made some readers feel uncomfortable whether it is consciously or subconsciously.Kuang’s evaluation of the publishing industry is layered and forces both publishing and the bookish community to do some reevaluation. What she singlehandedly captures in this book has been the biggest criticism that many of us have been vocal about since 2020. Publishing used the death of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement to claim to want more diversity and has in some ways published more diverse books; however, have we really paid attention to what those stories have centered? Trauma versus joy. So many of these stories have been centered on generational trauma, books that are used to educate and make the White masses feel better about not knowing much about diverse experiences prior to 2020. Marginalized voices in publishing are “permitted” to be a part of the community as long we play the roles that we are supposed to play. Once we begin to infiltrate the industry too much, those same people with “BLM” in their twitter bios, the same people who claim to be liberal do the same damn mental gymnastics June did to excuse her behavior. The system was designed for June to do what she did and the moment that marginalized communities “steal” the shine, it’s okay to push back because as June believes she’s the true minority and oppressed person in all of this. Don’t believe me, you should check out the TikTok made by an author who claims that white writers now get turned down because all agents want are BIPOC writers. Or better yet, just listen to foolishness that was uttered from James Patterson who had the audacity to state the White men are the truly oppressed writers in the industry.And let’s take this a step further and look at how Kuang illustrated the danger that publishing has ultimately created with it’s use of terms like #ownvoices. Athena wasn’t ever allowed to write outside of trauma. She’s pigeonholed into only writing one thing. And honestly, I’m sure that happens more than we would like to believe. Authors who want to explore something outside of their “assigned” roles either get turned down or the marketing is trash. It delves deeper into the question of who is allowed to tell what story? Was Athena any better of a fit to tell the story of Chinese laborers of WWI than June? Is research enough to tell something outside of one’s lived experience? These are things to think about and something that we are confronted with every day in this community. Think about books likeAmerican DirtandMemoirs of a Geisha.This book is both absurd and unhinged because so is publishing and the book community. And I’ve been involved in all of it for so many years. Kuang told ya’ll to kiss her ass with this book. She is behaving in the complete opposite manner that is “expected” of her as young, thin, conventionally beautiful Asian woman. And the fact that she owns that shit makes so many people feel uncomfortable. And quite frankly I applaud her for that. BIPOC writers and creators are tired of the expectation that we are supposed to behave, create, write, and provide educational pieces in way that makes others feel comfortable. We’re supposed to applaud White people for the amazing work they’ve done in “allowing” us to enter the spaces and “give” us the opportunity to tell “our stories.” It’s laughable at this point and while ya’ll give Kuang these 1 and 2 star reviews, she’s going to be laughing her pretty, thin, and educated ass all the way to the damn bank.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'If publishing is rigged, you might as well make sure it’s rigged in your favor.4.5 stars. Holy shit, I had an absolute blast reading this! I inhaled it in a day. Forgive me if I make no sense because I stayed up late to finish it!To be honest, I wasn\'t going to readYellowface. I found Kuang\'sBabelto be so painfully boring and didactic, like reading a textbook, that I thought we were parting ways for good. But then it seemed like everyone I know read this and liked it, so curiosity got the better of me.And, wow, is this really the same author? What a ride. The suspense! The vitriol! The fucking audacity!I want to take a moment to acknowledge something I found quite ironic-- Kuang\'s other books are fantasy books about magic and colonialism and boarding schools while this one has the very lukewarm premise of being about authors and the publishing process... but, my god, when it comes to pageturners evenThe Poppy Warhad nothing on this.A satire, is it? Well, maybe, but I\'ve never read such a gripping and suspenseful satire. Kuang rips the publishing industry to shreds with this book, and she does it from the perspective of a white author who steals the first draft manuscript of a dead Chinese author.I sat open-mouthed pretty much the entire time wondering if she was going to get away with it or get caught. Kuang uses a lot of social media to tell this story and it is highly effective at keeping the pacing up. We all know social media is a shitstorm of people vying for attention, performing for validation and, occasionally, making genuinely important points, and we see it all play out here to the extreme.I thoughtBabellacked nuance, butYellowfaceis the complete opposite. Both June and Athena are complex characters. Athena is not allowed to simply be the perfect victim and, in fact, what emerges over the course of the novel is someone who is quite unlikable herself. June has done something objectively bad, but the author resists the temptation to paint her as one-dimensional. Her desperation and self-delusion, her anxiety and her jealousy, feel real.At first glance, June appears to be the villain, but I think it becomes clear as the story progresses that this is much bigger than June. Kuang calls out the publishing industry and the messed up way books are primarily marketed through a social media performance. The young authors choking on their jealousy as they are pitted against one another. The agents and editors urging authors to publish “anything” while they have “social capital” regardless of whether it’s good or not.And, of course, the way many in the publishing industry view ""diversity"" as a marketing buzzword to sell more books, rather than having the genuinely noble goal of diversifying literature. As Brett, June\'s agent, admits at one point:""But at the end of the day all that really matters is cash flow.""This is a chaotic, highly-frustrating, impossible-to-put-down book. I rollercoasted from emotion to emotion reading it and I\'m sure I will still be talking about it long after I\'m done writing this review.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is a compelling, cynical, and thought-provoking satire that delves into themes of plagiarism, racism, and internet trolling. It offers a realistic portrayal of the publishing industry within the framework of a heart-pounding thriller. The story revolves around an anti-heroine driven by power and insecurity, who assumes the identity of her deceased friend to publish a masterpiece. Loneliness and the desperate desire for recognition serve as driving forces, pushing the protagonist to extreme measures.Remarkably, I found myself attached to a book despite disliking the main character. At times, I wished I could physically enter the story and confront June Hayward/ Juniper Song, who committed the ultimate crime: stealing her late friend Athena Liu\'s unpublished book. The reasons behind this act of creative theft are complex and include jealousy, thirst for power, honoring her friend\'s work in the best way possible, and seeking personal gain. It is a tale that explores unfairness, harbored resentment, and a thirst for karmic justice.One of the standout aspects of the book is the author\'s astute commentary on the perils faced by writers, such as internet trolls who use their freedom of speech rights to berate and belittle their creations. The story skillfully examines the commodification of writers, where their looks, personality, color of their skin and online presence become as important as their writing itself.This book truly blew my mind. I was unable to put it down, yet also needed to take breaks due to the chaotic and anxiety-inducing experience of living within Juniper\'s mind. The character evokes strong emotions, including frustration towards her misogyny, blind ambition, and obnoxious justifications for her actions.It is worth noting that Juniper is not the sole antagonist in the narrative. The judgmental and self-righteous individuals surrounding her also exhibit misogynistic tendencies and relish in criticizing and witnessing the downfall of others, all while raising their champagne glasses in celebration. Even Athena, portrayed as socially awkward and naive, adds depth to the story as a potential soul-sucking character for a gripping plotline.In this book, nobody is a saint, as being good-hearted does not guarantee financial security, career success, fame, or power. The author skillfully portrays flawed and complex characters who challenge the reader\'s perceptions.Overall, this realistic and thrilling read left me feeling anxious and evoked a multitude of emotions including fear, hate, and sadness. It successfully accomplished its mission of shaking the reader to their core and provoking deep thoughts that linger for days. The essence of a masterpiece lies in its ability to challenge readers and evoke a range of feelings, and this book achieves just that.I wholeheartedly consider this one of the best books of the year, and I urge you not to overlook it or let it languish in your ""to be read"" list.

You write 'em, I read 'em. And the ones I like best tend to be a little bit tongue-in-cheek and satirical, inviting you to see the world through the plagiarist's eyes. After all, they're not really bad people, are they? They see a story that needs telling, and they're the ones to tell it. So what if the story isn't theirs to tell in the first place?And soYellowfaceenters that arena with its own take on this eyebrow-raising topic. And right off the bat, I'm intrigued. June is an interesting plagiarist-protagonist. She starts off as a writer struggling for relevance, and that struggle is something we can all relate to. It's not as if she decides to become a plagiarist overnight. No, it's a slippery slope of small decisions, each one understandable on its own, that ultimately lands her in such an ignoble profession.Once I started, I couldn't put it down. June's voice is as compelling as it is grotesque, and it's hard to look away from such self-inflicted catastrophe. You know this isn't going to turn out well, and yet she just keeps going. The best satires always elicit a lot of wincing, and that definitely happened here.I don't mind telling you guys that this story made me uncomfortable. And I'm sure that is R.F. Kuang's intention. June isn't some crazy thief, at least not initially. Rather, she's drawn as this morally ambiguous, somewhat sympathetic character. In fact, from certain angles, she looks almost downright reasonable, making the best of what she's got. And this sly characterization leaves the reader both fascinated and uneasy, for we feel drawn towards June even though she is the villain of this tale. And that cognitive dissonance stays with us throughout.The first half of the book was particularly strong for me because of that perfect balance between hero and antihero. There's a lot of subtlety that allows June to be both appealing and repulsive. However, once we get to June's book release and her subsequent guilt and justification, it does start to take on more and more of a crazed tinge, and as a result, lost a lot of the subtlety that made the first half so compelling for me.There is a lot packed into this little story: racial commentary, inside look at being a writer and the publishing industry, internet trolling, cultural appropriation. And it's all done seamlessly. I have to applaud the author for both not being afraid to wade into these interesting topics, as well as saying something of substance about each of them.What a fascinating story this turned out to be. Subversive and uncomfortable, it really drew me in and kept me glued to the pages.

This is a book worthy of discussion. It has both blatant and nuanced themes of racism and xenophobia that might go over some reader\'s heads or might seem too in-your-face for others. A group discussion can help reader\'s recognize the realism of R.F. Kuang\'s literary approach and see that even if you don\'t relate to the content, you still have to understand that it\'s other people\'s reality.Will you enjoy a single character? Categorically NO. But you will walk away with a greater understanding of the many failings of the publishing industry and how you might be unconsciously taking part in some of those failings.It\'s eye opening. It\'s ballsy. It\'s crass. It\'s wild and brilliant.I will say that the half star reduction is solely because of Candice. While her insistence upon sensitivity reader\'s was a good call in my opinion, her manner of calling things out and getting things done were over-dramatized to the nth degree. While I think R.F. Kuang is brilliant for having the opposing side of June also be contrarian, Candice didn\'t fill the spot I wanted her to in opposition to June. I know it wasn\'t a character to necessarily root for instead of June. But I saw June\'s motives and her horrible mental manipulation that she attempted to gaslight ourselves into believing were just. But Candice just felt cartoonishly villainous. Maybe that\'s just my view of her. Other\'s could read it differently.But, overall, this is absolutely worth your time. Please read this. It is a shining gem in the 2023 literary world.March 2023 ⭐️4.5RF Kuang DID THAT.This woman fears nothing and no one. What a hero.She said ""Talk about the publishing industry? How about the racism, misogyny, xenophobia, plagiarism, pretty-privilege and everything else revolting that comes along with it? You don\'t want to acknowledge that? Welp, too bad. Cause I\'m gonna write it so well, you\'ll be begging to publish it.""I thought that RF Kuang was going to write about her experience with publishing through the eyes of the main character. But that\'s the direct opposite approach she takes. Her self-insert is actually with Athena, the main character\'s college friend turned renowned author.The main character is a depiction of mild mannered racist individuals who shroud themselves in acceptance as long as it doesn\'t affect them and balk at the idea of racism until directly faced with equality and the loss of superiority it gives them.This is an excellent look at how real and deep rooted racism is. It\'s everywhere and in everyone. It just isn\'t always shouting it\'s ideals. It\'s sitting still while someone else does something harmful. It\'s deluding yourself when you get the job over someone of color when you know you\'re under qualified. It\'s in so many small and micro ways. And it\'s absolutely vile to watch/read.

It was so in-depth into the industry it made my heart sing and despare at the same time (as a publishing post-graduate first and then as a compulsive reader part of the online community). It managed to highlight a slew of things that make publishing not such a great place to be at in very few pages and I'm amazed. To me this book kind of felt like a very long article but with twists and turns. Now I know why they released arcs so early (looking at you, HarperCollins 👀). Book twitter will have a field day with this one...What a choice to have the main narrative voice be the plagiarizer (and in first person at that).Both Athena and June are awful people, and I love that neither of them is a saint, but reading the entire thing from June's pov? Insane. She's a frustrating character, not gonna lie, but she's also deliciously realistic as a two-faced, self-absorbed and dishonest manipulator that always has an excuse ready. She goes out of her way to say to the reader that she wants to do something for poc every chance she gets, but the reality is that she's a bitch trying to profit from it all in an industry that lets her do it. Sometimes it's subtle, sometimes it's not too difficult to miss her slipping into a plain wrong mentality and lol, basic whiteness.You think you're safe as the external reader? Not a chance.I'm not proud to say I fell straight into R.F. Kuang's trap, because was I seriously rooting for such a cheater the entire time? This book brainwashed me into supporting someone who stole a whole manuscript immediately after witnessing the author's death and reaching stardom by publishing it as her own. I got to the point where I was scared she was going to get caught and hoped she would get out of it unscathed.My brain ignored all the red flags and procedeed to scam me until the very end.I mean, of course I ended up wishing she would kill someone to shut them up. Of course I got second-hand anxiety from her messing up with her publishing team and at her events. Of course I cared about her mental health. Am I okay or what? Is it time for me to get theraphy too?On the other hand, Athena is harder to grasp.You really need to have the whole picture with her, which you only get by reading the book till the end.I loved the way RFK slowly built her character. You only read about her from June's perpective when she's already dead and still she comes through as the main character, not less because June is literally obsessed with her. Well-written toxic friendships are my bread and butter and the one in here was one of my favorites. The way it was dealt with: nothing less of spectacular. I found June's morality to be the most interesting aspect of this book, but the relationship between her and Athena comes in second for sure.Much care went into the secondary characters too.Even when they only fully appeared once or twice, they always had a well-rounded story behind them.I can apply that specifically to the publishing team and Geoff. From that last one it's again apparent and so on-the-nose how me and RFK's morally grey characters just work together. What can I say? I'm fascinated with them. Geoff reminded me of so many white male authors on twitter but he just had a pull. I loved that he was so pathetic, that I never knew what he was going to do and then, when I least expected it and as naturally as possible, he showed a completely different side to himself.There are a couple of things I didn't completely enjoy, mainly the pop culture references (way too many, half of them were necessary, the others not so much), and the ending.Overall the ending itself wasn't bad, I loved how it wrapped up, but that final showdown bordered on cartoonish and because of that it was hard to take it seriously. I also feel like the final chapter is missing, although I understand what this novel is actually supposed to be (have I said meta already?).In conclusion, an amazing foray into general fiction by R.F. Kuang. I swear this woman can do no wrong. Give her whatever topic to write about and I bet she can create something incredible out of the most boring premise.I think it's impressive how she took these modern controversies and wrote them into a twisty unputdownable story.It seems to me like it's a new experiment from her but at the same time a really smart jab at publishing too.I wouldn't say it's a perfect book and I'm unsure if I would reread it likeThe Poppy Wartrilogy; however I can't exclude it won't live in my mind rent free as I still catch myself heavily thinking about it.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Oh, Booktwitter, Bookstagram! You lied.This wasn\'t v. good.Yellowface is about June Heyward who steals a manuscript from her best-selling author frenemy.

They state, ""Criticizing the opinions of others is permitted, but attacking individuals for their opinions is not.""Personally, I have never had a problem with an author, publisher, or GoodReads so you can write negative reviews (just make sure not to violate the Community Guidelines).This book does bring up some interesting points around who gets to tell certain stories and plagiarism.I found this issue of plagiarism particularly ironic because Yellowface didn\'t strike me as very original, essentially a mashup ofThe Plot by Jean Hanoff KorelitzandThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L Frank Baum. Furthermore, RF Kuang had a scene inThe Poppy War (published 2018)where the main character was training by carrying a pig up a mountain.Well, there is a story inHoles (published 1998)by Louis Sachar where someone carries a pig up a mountain.However, people create retellings all the time. There are lots of familiar and time-tested tropes and plots. At what point is it plagiarism?

If Rebbeca Kuang saw this quote, she must have mixed it up because she wrote this book as though it\'s meant for children who want to graduate to adult fiction.Yellowface is an unsubtle, hammer-to-the-forehead quasi-treatise about the dangers of White Women. Those villainised hacks who never see how what they\'re doing is wrong. They\'re Karens, but they voted for Biden. No really, June Hayward says she is a Democrat, and liberal, and voted for Biden multiple times within the book. Hayward a mediocre author who is friends (and we\'re not really convinced why) with a Chinese American literary star Athena Liu who dies suddenly after a pancake goes down the wrong hole, and Hayward is too inept to perform the Heimlich manoeuvre.After this, Hayward steals Liu\'s manuscript about Chinese laborers forcefully conscripted by the French during World War 1. The caucasity is unsurprising, trite, and racist covering all the beats we experienced every time we covered Discourse about films like The Blindside, Hidden Figures Greenbook, and books like The Help, or American Dirt.This book is not funny, it\'s not particularly well-written, with a literal typo in the first few pagesThe editor who did got fired,. The narrative is repetitive and disjointed, like puzzle pieces forced together from different boxes. There were scenes where June\'s narration is simply exhausting.I have to remind Athena this every single time. She has a goldfish’s memory when it comes to my problems—it takes two or three repetitions for anything to stick.First of all, Rebecca, goldfish don\'t have short memories. Some can keep them for years. Secondly, you already said this multiple times. We aren\'t ""goldfish"", we aren\'t sieves. We don\'t need incessant spoonfeeding about something you already said. In the opening stints, June mentions how her debut was left to languish by her editor at the pathetic imprint that was the only one that gave her a chance. It didn\'t need to be repeated. It also speaks to a certain lack of, perhaps, awareness by Rebecca about how publishing classifies books. When they acquire a manuscript, the books are then delineated, and different budgets are assigned to the books based on what they think will be most profitable. In the current environment, poorly written horny romantasy, AI and climate change scare stories, American POC history and struggle porn, badly written romance, and whatever book Booktok bestows its benevolent virality are the ones most likely to get publishing buzz.Majority of the authors are very white, very North American, or very British. June\'s lack of awareness of how publishing works spoke more to Rebecca\'s ignorance or laziness. And ultimately, her scapegoating of publishing ""wanting diverse stories"" rings hollow. Maybe this story would have been better if June had whitewashed a literary navel-gazing story about vulnerability and identity.Beyond the amateurish prose that suffered from sudden bursts of Thesaurus-itis, for example, on Pg. 6 Rebecca writes,It’s so fucking arbitrary. Or perhaps not arbitrary, but it hinges on factors that have nothing to do with the strength of one’s prose.then on Pg. 102Can\'t we all get behind decrying antimiscegenation?June also says Athena\'s prose is repetitive while her monologues feel like a scratched CD. One could argue that Rebecca is trying to show how June is unaware of her lack of talent but you can\'t help but wonder if she is just a serviceable writer. The book takes pains to be accessible for mass audiences. Rebecca also wants to explain every little detail such as ARCs and sensitivity readers-jargon everyone who is involved in The Community would know. June even goes on a diatribe when discussing a potential movie deal and says,Accessibility matters.and when undressing the stolen manuscript that\'s ""difficult"" to read, she says,It’s distracting from the central narrative. Reading should be an enjoyable experience, not a chore.Is this satire or Rebecca explaining why the prose is so bland and repetitive.My suspension of disbelief was unwilling and abused by how ridiculous some of the events in publishing happen. When June mentions the Goodreads Choice Awards more times than more prestigious ones, I couldn\'t help but wonder if Rebecca doesn\'t understand literary Oscars season or if she was trying to pander to Goodreads Choice Awards voters (this book will definitely be listed under Best Fiction). The GCAs are a popularity contest. Rarely do people read all the books listed, they only vote for what they loved. Additionally, no discerning reader who wants a book about Chinese labourers in WW1 would give a fuck about GCAs.Or is this a 4D chess Trojan horse where readers are actually being unwittingly tested as a focus group? Some people will prefer a female friendship story where race dynamics are explored (The Hate U Give), or perhaps they will want a thriller involving authors and books (Too Close To Home by Linwood Barclay), a meta narrative about who gets to tell a story (Bad Art Friend), a serial plagiariser (look up Jumi Bello), or Asian American nonfiction (Minor Feelings) and Rebecca can pick her next project. Maybe Rebecca is staging herself as the host of the round table to discuss whether authors should interact with reviews. But as we saw with Lauren Hough, the answer is still no.There was also a glaring pattern where June kept pointing out Athena\'s flaws. How she was once the actual bad art friend, how Twitter Hot Take enthusiasts called her a race traitor. But we never get to delve into that because June believesno one is that deep into Chinese history or politics. Great job, Rebecca. You have shut down your critics for the lack of nuance in Asian history and characters in Babel. Athena is so offensively superficially written that I almost wished we had gotten her point of view, as a villain who wants to step on all faces to the top of the literary throne. The few snippets we get of her prose show she\'s a much better writer than June and her narration would have been more palatable than June\'s weapons of mass boredom.There\'s a certain Discourse we\'re supposed to have from this book about Bad White Women, and how publishing serves to silence writers of colour. We also have to discuss who gets to tell certain stories. The problem is, we have spoken about this ad nauseum. So who is this book for? Outsiders who would like to know how it works? Adults who wanted a meta vivisection of this insular world but with Dark Themes?Rebecca doesn\'t know. She says it\'s a thriller examining the idiosyncracies of publishing. It\'s not thrilling. And it has a myopic view of how publishing works. About good intentions that went poorly when June always set out to usurp Athena\'s work from the jump? It\'s not satire. It\'s a reverse Künstlerroman. Why is it necessary? The book doesn\'t tell you because it ends like a flaccid plateau.

I thought it was very inappropriate how the author used an objectively bitchy and untrustworthy narrator as a mouthpiece for all of the REAL LIFE criticisms that the actual author has received in real life. By doing this, all of the critiques seem like they come from people who are just jealous and have no valid arguments against her self-insert martyr author character Athena (who mirrors the real life author in many, MANY ways). I read this book one year before it was actually published, so there might have been changes, but from this video and other reviews I\'ve seen, not much is different from when I first read it.I will be honest up front: this review is entirely plagiarized.Was I not meant to admit that? Should I have, instead, gone on long, rambling, and yet tersely flat paragraphs about how ironic it is that I am negatively critiquing a book about plagiarism by using the same points as everyone else? Should I call this satire—granted that there is nothing humorous and that I am not particularly strongly exaggerating anything—as I amateurly write prose so unabashedly written in my own voice that it would be impossible to separate any idea from my own? Because that appears to be the direction this book has gone in.I am not the first to say that this reads like RFK\'s notes app consciousness, nor will I be the last. While I will not get into specifics, as this is an incredibly early copy of the book, I will say that anyone who even remotely knows anything about the author will see the similarities between them and...certain things. Now, I have no issue with an author writing from experience.\'Write what you know\'is both an incredibly popular and successful piece of advice given to wannabee-writers. Butfuck,at some point one has to wonder about the motivation behind it.Simply put, because there is no other way to put it, this book felt like a circle-jerk. I should have expected such a thing from a satire on the publishing industry written by a prominent figure within it. It is typical—of course they will ridicule things like social media and how the masses view them. Of course they will glower at criticisms and mock fellow authors. Is that not the purpose of satire? But this feels like so much more than that. Instead, I feel as if RFK is speaking to me in a jest. Like she is pointing toward the book community, head cocked to the side, cheekily winking in our shared knowledge of their ridiculousness. Her eyes say,look at them—look at their silliness and their worries and their jealousy. See how they behave like animals, that group of people outside of our circle.Like she\'ll laugh right after, content in her knowledge that she lives in an absurd space, and that only we understand its absurdity.My first tip-off—no, not my first, though perhaps the most obscene—is how she uses our untrustworthy protagonist. RFK is, without a doubt, excellent at writing bad people. I have never argued against this, and I rather think I never will. But in this way, I feel almost uncomfortable when her unlikable characters serve the role of real people. She mocks criticism she has received in the past for her very real, non-fictitious books, through these characters. It feels, once again, like a terrible inside joke I have been privy to. As if the reader is meant to read these and think,these ridiculous characters! To say such things as this!And yet when one is aware of the author\'s actual past, it becomes...awkward. That is, she is not an author of subtlety. The satire could not work because it was not sufficiently...anything! I did not find it funny, nor was it so exaggerated as to be comical.The writing in general did not work for me.Babel,for all of its long-winded sentences and unending paragraphs of description, felt like a declaration of loyalty to words. This book, instead, felt like it was made by someone who could not care less for such things. This is, I understand, literary fiction. RFK has gone out of her normal bubble of fantasy to try something new, and I truly commend her for it. But I must question if this is the right genre for her. She is blunt and uncouth, neither of which are particularly bad—nor do I even dislike it—but which are painfully obvious throughout this. I felt like I was reading one of those High School creative writing class exercises (something which I actually do on a daily basis) where the young, inexperienced creator feels the need to say things like ""but you\'ll never guess what happens next"" and ""this is something that\'ll come up later"" in their first point of view narrative as if the reader is not skillful enough to gradually realize such things later on. Its modernist setting equally paid a part in this. There are only so many times you can name-drop an author or celebrity or, God-be-damned, fucking Harry Potter before realizing you have written something that reads like a Buzzfeed quiz. No, the narration did not work for me, nor did I think that any of it ultimately paid off in its strange and wholly random ending I can only describe as, ""really?""I struggle to find the words to end this. I\'m afraid I have run out of other people\'s thoughts to steal as I reword them into my own. I want to clarify that I do like the author\'s other works. Out of the five books of hers I\'ve read (all of her works except for that one anthology she worked on), I\'ve really liked and sometimes loved three of them. But that doesn\'t mean I\'m not capable of thinking that this was not her best genre, nor her best work by any means. This book felt like the worst possible self-awareness. The type shared over grins and knowing smiles, wherein both parties are partaking in the mockery of a group of people they think themselves entirely separated from. This is a book that both ridicules authors while falling to its knees, proclaiming its undying devotion to them. Funny enough, I praisedBabelfor a much similar sentiment. But where in that book I enjoyed the constant switch between criticizing the power and history of words to being mesmerized over them,Yellowfacefelt more like a sledgehammer.Love me,it sayslike I love you—all of us—the sophisticated and knowledgeable professionals.

For maybe the first fifty pages or so the writing felt a bit dry, though when the plot picks up, I found myself so curious to know: will this white woman who stole an Asian American woman’s work get caught?? Will she confront her own insecurities that led to this? Is Athena actually dead?? R.F. Kuang creates a selfish, self-absorbed main character in June Hayward, with a consistent voice that kept me engaged inYellowface’s story.I also think this book does open up important conversations. Yes, at times it makes its point bluntly/crudely and in an obvious way, though through this satire Kuang raises deeper questions too, such as whether anyone can remain truly ethical or generous in a brutally capitalist publishing industry. I liked how Kuang didn’t make Athena a perfect character because by doing so, she highlights how people of color can engage in problematic and oppressive practices too.So even though I didn’t agree with all of Kuang’s satirical commentary inYellowface(e.g., I think Asian Americans should be asked hard, critical questions about glorifying whiteness both in dating partners and in other areas of life), I respect that she seized a popular topic in the publishing industry and made a novel out of it. The exaggerated nature of satire doesn’t always lend itself to a deeper emotional connection with the characters or the story, though I don’t think a deep emotional connection is necessarily the point of this novel. Overall, while I don’t see this novel breaking into my top ten list at the end of this year, I found it an interesting read and one that may be fun to discuss.*also, just to add, this type of thing is still happening all the time, including in other industries. Recently I saw a white woman publish a research paper on Black and Latinx mothers and when I emailed her and asked about her research practices with these communities, she literally just ignored me. And, as I\'ve written about in at least one other review, one time I gently called in a white woman for doing her dissertation on Asian American women (with no Asian American women as coauthors) and she called me aggressive and ""untrusting."" sigh!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '”Who has the right to write about suffering?”Have you ever read a book that is so timely and effective in its message that you do not feel the slightest bit qualified to review it?

What I mean is, it’s clearly satire, but to an extent that these characters are not exact flesh and blood, but the issues discussed in this book are far from farcical. Most reviewers have noticed the central themes inYellowfacerearing their ugly head in the real world, especially in the past few years, so it is refreshing and exhilarating to read a fictional novel encompassing these issues in a way that onlyR.F. Kuangcould create.”Give me your bruises and hurts, she told us, and I will return to you a diamond.”Let’s be clear: June is not a character that you will feel empathy for. She will not be redeemed, rooted for, or endeared by the end; however, watching her downfall is oddly satisfying in a way that I cannot quite explain. The insight into the process of releasing a book with a Big Five publisher is compelling and intriguing, and it’s, sadly, easy to see how something like this story could transpire. The beauty of this tale is no one is safe from criticism; Kuang makes it clear that there are various forms of privilege that transpire across lines of race, class, gender, etc., and every single character really has something to answer for.In one word:Brilliant.*Many thanks to the publisher for providing my review copy.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I'M CRYING, THROWING UP, RIPPING MY HAIR OUT AND THEN CRYING SOME MORE!Rebecca F.

It takes a genius to achieve that.She explored every possible aspect or every question you might have, every side you could possibly take on this subject, doesn't leave much room for the reviewer, but I'm not complaining (I like my thoughts planted)PLOT The blurb is short and easy to understand, so i don't feel the need to retell it once more (I know I would do a poor job). I saw that most reviews on here surrounded the issues of the publishing industry as the central theme of this book, but I wouldn't agree. Just like with Babel, the racial debate takes the biggest piece of the cake, just dressed in different icing. But again, I'm not complaining. The book community is rarely not problematic, let's be honest, we are witnessing whitewashing and white supremacy on here every day. So, to not be blind and ignorant, we should learn about the topic EVERY DAY.

Alice Oseman continues to deliver queer joy and charming storytelling with an adorable balance of cute romance and earnest investigations of heavy, complex emotions. It feels like it has been forever but it’s so lovely to be back with this crew.Heartstopperhas always plunged into difficult yet relatable subjects and this fifth volume is no different. Oseman has always done an excellent job at crafting her characters to feel like authentic teenagers and here we get to witness them growing up a bit more and heading into the next stage of life: college. We also get to experience Nick setting out in the world on his own while Charlie is back at home and even after 5 marvelous volumes I’m always thrilled to find the characters reading as increasingly nuanced yet still familiar. Going away to college issues were addressed in Oseman’s much earlier novellaNick and Charlie, and while this touches on some similar themes this is a completely different story.Though college isn’t the only hurdle here, as anxieties about sex dominate a lot of Charlie’s narrative. As always, Oseman does a great job at representing these issues in an age-authentic way and the character’s emotions practically jump right off the page. There’s some other interesting dynamics to this story too, from discussions on asexuality and also a peek into Charlie’s mom’s childhood. While some of the side characters are a bit more in the background, I’ve always found the series does a good job of making them all rather dynamic and interesting instead of all just extensions of the main characters.All in all, this is another heartwarming edition to an already endearing series. I can’t wait for the next volume, though *gasp* I hear it is to be the final episode in the Heartstopper saga.5/5'}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""wAIT, WHY IT SAYS 2023 AND FINAL INSTALMENT?

La Vérité sur l'Affaire Harry Quebert (Marcus Goldman, #1)
",Joël Dicker,4.19,194260,6073,"Thriller, Fiction, Mystery, Crime, France, Mystery Thriller, Contemporary",863,19-09-2012,"À New York, au printemps 2008, alors que l’Amérique bruisse des prémices de l’élection présidentielle, Marcus Goldman, jeune écrivain à succès, est dans la tourmente : il est incapable d’écrire le nouveau roman qu’il doit remettre à son éditeur d’ici quelques mois. Le délai est près d’expirer quand soudain tout bascule pour lui : son ami et ancien professeur d’université, Harry Quebert, l’un des écrivains les plus respectés du pays, est rattrapé par son passé et se retrouve accusé d’avoir assassiné, en 1975, Nola Kellergan, une jeune fille de 15 ans, avec qui il aurait eu une liaison. Convaincu de l’innocence de Harry, Marcus abandonne tout pour se rendre dans le New Hampshire et mener son enquête. Il est rapidement dépassé par les événements : l’enquête s’enfonce et il fait l’objet de menaces. Pour innocenter Harry et sauver sa carrière d’écrivain, il doit absolument répondre à trois questions : Qui a tué Nola Kellergan? Que s’est-il passé dans le New Hampshire à l’été 1975? Et comment écrit-on un roman à succès?","[{'rating': 1, 'content': ""OH MY GOD IT'S SO BADSpare yourselves; do not buy/read/LOOK AT this book. It was physically painful to finish. If this is the yardstick by which we measure books these days, I'll just lock myself into past centuries and never ever read modern books. What ON EARTH caused this book to receive such acclaim???So, just to get it out of the way, the construction kind of stands, although I'd have to think about even that. It's a little grotesquely baroque, with everyone seemingly having had a hand in the murder that 'fateful day', but it was emphatically not the worst thing about this book..... so in no particular order, and with plenty of spoilers, probably - it's not as if I care- writers are NOT interesting main characters, and this one in particular takes the cherry; self-absorbed, vain, narcissistic, with every sycophantic character telling him how wonderful, talented, smart, 'Magnificent' (sic!!!) he is - and that also applies to the OTHER writer in the book, Harry Québert, whose 15-year old lover seemed to have been born only to fawn over/praise/massage his ego. The main character 'wants to be a writer more than anything else in the world' and there is much inane talk/Hallmark life lessons about writing.... Ok, but writing what??? What was his 'fabulous first book' all about anyway?? What is his substance??He sounds just like prepubescent kids who want to be rock stars for the fame and never think for a second about the music - It's all about the packaging with Marcus Goldman - oh and let's not forget the CROWDS of New Yorkers who mob him with questions - mwahahaha!!! This might happen with A-list actors, maaaaybe, even though New Yorkers are WAY TOO COOL to crowd celebrities thank you very much, but WRITERS?? Do we even know what writers look like???Moving on - within the very first chapter, we learn he's all about his Italian shoes, expensive NY apartment and trophy girlfriend, while being a self-aggrandizing whiny lying cheating asshole - I can't believe there's a rule (Hallmark lesson on writing) at the end of the book about hooking readers in the first chapter - I suggest likeable characters!!So a writer writing about a writer writing about a writer... God knows I love books but even I found this a bit indigestible.- laughable secondary characters; we all know Hollywood movies that fall flat because they have 40 competing writers all working on the same script, and one of them has to shoehorn comic relief no matter what, so you end up with ridiculous formulaic poorly grafted-on one-liners - so here goes the gallery of 1-dimensional buffoons; the Jewish mother - the 'frustrated but deep' bar owner - the Republican lawyer who has a cash machine where his heart should be - the threatening, grandiose, immoral publisher - none of which is deep enough to understand TRU LUV.- which brings me, inevitably to the 'love' (sic) story. Oh please. I'm writhing inside. While I very much accept that age difference is not an impediment to LUV, a 34-year old 'falling in luv' with a 15 year old because she's 'dancing in the rain' (sic) sounds like... drumroll... INFATUATION, or LUST. Mister bigshot writer (which one? Does it matter?) should have a way with words, but seems utterly incapable of self-analysis, diagnostic, soul-searching etc.And from there we get the MOST INANE dialogues I have EVER read outside of Barbara Cartland books. Even 33 YEARS later, the dude wallows in self-pity and 'she's the only one I'll ever love' whines that make me want to smash a Dicker into a wall. Why were you in Luv, exactly? 'Cause she made you sandwiches and 'took care of you'???I kid you not, this is what their whole relationship is about, and - wait for it - they only hang out for THREE MONTHS.Also, (spoiler, but do you care at this point?) the kid is orphaned and psychotic - is there anything that screams 'victim with MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES' any louder to you? And did Harry Québert actually NOTICE these 'little details' about ‘his one true luv’?? Of course not, his gigantic EGO was in the way! Ach, this ‘book’ reminds me of Lars von Trier movies. 🤢🤮🤮So, fine, you may be attracted to someone 20 years your junior. But if that someone fits the description above and has massively crushed on you - well, I've got news, buster; you're just exploiting someone's vulnerabilities WHICH IS NOT LUV. And the fact that you throw the rest of your whole life away afterwards doesn't make your Luv 'more sacred'. It just makes you a creep who is unable to deal with reality and leads you to befriend only ONE person for the rest of your life - astonishingly, ANOTHER creep.- When. Does. The. Police. Ever. Let. A. Civilian. Lead. An. Investigation???? Especially in the US of A???? You have got to be kidding me. 🤯😖- oh the writing, oh the writing... Find me ONE teenager in the 70s who called her lover 'dârling' and said things like 'you're so beastly!'It sounds so fucking fake! I'll take an inch out of my sting because I read a translated version, but still - English AND French are both my native languages and as I was trying to go back and forth to imagine what the translator could have improved I was left in the dust. Oh, the maudlin, immature, 'poor-me' waterfalls in this book - oh what about the editing, the verbatim copies of previous pages - oh the psychological characterizations and depth that could fit in a thimble, oooh.It was atrocious. I can't believe this even got published. Maybe because there are publisher characters in there? Maybe because Dicker held someone's mother for blackmail? I simply do not get it. WHO ARE THESE READERS??!Read anything else.*Edit; some people are telling me to go fuck myself for this review. I can only imagine they’re Joel Dicker in disguise - or worse!

Even a grocery list. Or speak. He should go live in a monastery in the woods and never bother anyone again. Dear lord. Make it stop.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is an unusual book and a great mystery/detective story. It’s unusual in that it’s set in New England and you would never know that it was translated from the French. The Swiss author used to spend his summers in Maine.The story is Lolita-ish. Thirty-three years ago a college English professor/famous author from New Hampshire fell in love with a 15-year old girl. But unlike Humbert, Nabakov’s predator, this author genuinely tried to block his emotions – discouraging the girl from visiting his home; breaking up with her; trying to leave; not seeing her. He just couldn’t overcome his feelings.The older author lives in a seafront house so we get some local color of New Hampshire, especially in a local diner where a lot of the action takes place.Then the girl disappeared. The older man never recovered emotionally from her loss. Then thirty-three years after her disappearance, the girl’s body is accidentally found buried on the author’s property and, still grieving for her, he is charged with her murder.While he is in prison awaiting trial, a younger author, also a famous writer, comes to the aid of his former professor and mentor. They are both loners; each other’s only friend. The younger author, the book’s main character, sets out to prove his mentor’s innocence and our mystery begins.At first the case against the older author seems so convincing that we start with believing how could the perpetrator NOT be him? Little by little a second suspect emerges, and we are led to see how wrong we were. But it turns out the young girl led a much more dramatic life than we were aware of and now numerous suspects emerge. It’s a complex, tightly-knit plot, but we don’t get lost because of periodic discussions on the status of the investigation between the younger author and the lead detective on the case.With both main characters being famous authors, the older mentor to the younger, we learn a lot about the writing process, creative inspiration, technique, writer’s block, etc. Most chapters are prefaced with snippets of the mentor’s advice on writing. We also get quite a bit on dealing with publishers and literary agents. An example that also illustrates the humor in the novel: The main character starts receiving threatening letters while investigating to help his friend. Since he intends to write a book about the investigation, his agent tells him:“That’s great! That’ll really help sell the book. Imagine if someone tries to kill you – you could add another zero to the sales figures….two if you actually die.”“As long as I die after finishing the book.”“That goes without saying.”The writing is good, not great, but, hey, it’s a mystery/detective novel. Some snippets I liked:“No matter where you go, your problems go with you.”(As the author of a non-fiction book published a few months ago, I offer this one with trepidation): “Only write fiction. Anything else will just bring you trouble.”“People all over the world take responsibility, without even being aware of it, for advertising your product on a global scale. Isn’t that incredible? Facebook users are just people wearing sandwich boards for free.”The book was a huge seller internationally when published in 2012 – more than 3 million copies sold. On GR it has more than 55,000 ratings and almost 7,000 reviews. It’s not critically acclaimed but I think it’s a great mystery/detective read, a break from heavier stuff, so I’m giving it a 5 and adding it to my favorites.Top photo from newhampshirehomes.comMiddle photo from careyandgiampa.comPhoto of the author from Goodreads'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Yeah, I have no idea why this is supposed to be so amazing. The plot itself is kind of uninspiring and reminds me of so many ""dark secrets in a small town"" stories that Stig Larssen popularized. And really, it\'s trying to be The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (just minus the secret Nazis) so badly it\'s kind of laughable.The characters were universally unlikable - and honestly the jet-set life of the best-selling author kind of made me laugh my ass off. Maybe I missed when Jonathan Franzen was being recognized on the street? The only reason why I know what James Patterson or Michael Connolly look like is because they showed up on a couple episodes of Castle.(Also: The Origin of Evil is about... lovers separated by class? What?)(Also: So Harry Quebert basically wrote... The Notebook then?)And for all that this is about the amazing love affair betwen Harry Quebert and Nola (SEE! IT SOUNDS LIKE LOLA, WHICH IS REMINISCENT OF LOLITA, AREN\'T I MR. CLEVER-BOOTS??) and we\'re supposed to sympathize with Harry for his epic tale of love and loss, IT IS STILL ABOUT A 35 YEAR OLD MAN HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH A 15 YEAR OLD GIRL. I\'m sorry, I\'m just not going to get past the fact that we\'re supposed to sympathize with an hebephile who thinks a teenager was the love of his life.Then there\'s the dialogue. Holy shit. The dialogue is *atrocious*. People DO NOT TALK LIKE THAT. Even allowing for the differences between dialogue in movies and books and reality, the dlalogue is clunky and awkward at best and just down right mindbogglingly bad at worst. I\'m willing to split the difference in the blame here; this originally was written in French (IIRC), so there may be something lost in the translation but sweet sufferin\' Jeebus, if they\'re going to translate it, get someone who doesn\'t have a tin ear, huh?This was awful.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'La decepción del mes.

It is your failures that will give meaning to your victories'), small town community living, boxing, running, writing... so much and all in such a great story.It's about a summer in New Hampshire, in small town Somerset, when struggling author Harry Quebert fell in love with 15-year old Nola Kellergan, a forbidden love. 33 years later, her body is dug up from his yard, along with a manuscript copy of the novel that secured his lasting fame, 'The Origin of Evil'. Quebert is the only suspect. Markus Goldman, student once coached by Quebert, now a writer and friend, sets out to Somerset to investigate and clear Harry of any blame. Then... the story unfolds... (be careful not to pick up any spoilers!)Interesting to see this book is 'controversial' in reviews, I see ratings going from 1 to 5. I'm on 4.5 going on 5. Fabulous book, worth every page for me. Made me think of John Irving's Garp, must be because of the setting New Hampshire, but also the sports, boxing instead of wrestling, but close, and the weird set of characters. Made me think of Donna Tartt's Goldfinch, maybe because of the setting New York and also, because of the quirky set of characters. Made me think of Twin Peaks, yes, definitely, because of the freaky atmosphere among the various characters. From my side: Recommended!'You see Markus, the way it works in our society, we are constantly having to choose between reason and passion. Reason never helps anyone and passion is often destructive. So don't ask me to help you choose.'""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'This novel reinforces for me why I love big books so much:(1)\tThey cover a lot of territory without feeling rushed or cramped.(2)\tThey leave room for many different sub-plots to add spice and enhancement to the main plot.(3)\tTheir expansiveness, when utilized properly, allows the reader to live thoroughly the experiences in the book, sharing space with the characters, and getting to know them.In this novel, I was completely occupied with being surprised, shocked, and moved by the characters; sometimes I was busy being upset with them and judging them. Only to find out I was wrong. And then wrong again. And how amazing and liberating to be wrong some more, yet never for one minute relinquishing the urge to discover more about the people involved in this story – and to help solve the mysteries! Yes, I did feel I was right there in the story with everyone else trying to figure out what had happened. And what was still happening.Marcus Goldman wrote a book in his 20’s that made him famous. Then he was hit with what is referred to in the book as “the writer’s disease”. For almost two years he couldn’t put two sentences together and his publisher is now threatening legal action. He even went to visit Harry Quebert (kuh-bear), his literature professor from college at his beautiful home in New England. Not just his literature professor; also his mentor, his master. Even that did not help to get him unstuck and past the barrier of resistance that weighed on him.Shortly after Marcus’ visit, Harry Quebert is arrested for the murder of Nola Kellergan 33 years earlier. Her remains are discovered in the grounds of Harry’s home and Marcus discovers that when his mentor was 34 years old, he fell madly in love with a 15 year old high school girl shortly before publishing a masterpiece novel. Marcus is determined to clear his friend’s name and restore his reputation which is now in shreds. He also asks Harry for permission to write a book about all of this – both to set the record straight and to get some breathing space from his publisher’s pressure.This story is about love. Romantic love, obsessive love, protective love, ferocious love, fragile love, and many other shades of love. Here are a few quotes on the diverse aspects of love:”The truth does not change how you feel about someone. That’s the great tragedy of love. ””Love, love, always love! But what is love? It doesn’t mean anything! Love is just a trick invented by men so they don’t have to do their own laundry!””Cherish love, Marcus. Make it your greatest conquest, your sole ambition. After men, there will be other men. After books, there will be other books. After glory, there will be other glories. After money, there will be yet more money. But after love, Marcus, after love, there is nothing but the salt from tears.”This novel had me under its spell from the very beginning, and it kept me there – completely mesmerized – to the very end. I don’t think I have ever before read a book that is as dizzy-making with its myriad curves and twists and sharp turns. The story, the writing, the seamless integration of various timelines, and the characters – all of these together make for one of the most engaging reads I have experienced.What’s more, although this book shows up as 624 pages on my eReader, reading it felt like I was flying through the pages. This will be the first read of 2019 to land on my Favourites shelf – my ultimate Sixth Star.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Concuerdo plenamente con la sinopsis del libro y creo que es su mejor característica:La verdad sólo llega al final de unlargo, intrincado y apasionanterecorrido.

I went the latter route and was rewarded by a competent reading by Robert Slade. It’s also slow paced, sometimes agonisingly so.Marcus Goldman travels to Somerset, the New Hampshire town of his college professor, Harry Quebert, to attempt to unlock something that will enable him to write a follow–up to his first, highly successful, book. Soon after, the body of a 15-year-old girl is discovered on Harry’s property along with a manuscript of his acclaimed novel, The Origin of Evil. The girl, Nola Kellergan, had disappeared 33 years earlier. Harry is arrested and charged with Nola’s abduction and murder and Marcus decides to carry out an investigation of his own in the hope of clearing his mentor. He’s also persuaded to write a book about his investigation and accepts a multi-million-pound advance from his publisher.This book was originally written in French, and it might be that it’s lost something in translation. Certainly, for me, the telling of the relationship between Harry and Nola didn’t work at all. Harry is clearly an intelligent, articulate, good-looking man. Nola is all child, with little to offer in terms of conversation or intellect. The verbal exchanges between the two are painful in the extreme. We’re led to believe that Harry fell for her after a brief initial meeting at a beach and became obsessed by her thereafter. No – not for me. I know she’s portrayed as physically attractive, but even so…Much better are the conversations between the two writers and those between Marcus Goldman and his publisher. These are sharp and amusing. And the telephone calls between Marcus and his overbearing Jewish mother are hilarious. I kept wishing there was more of this and less of Nolla and the other, equally dull, inhabitants of Somerset.Then there’s the fact that nobody in Somerset seems to have been aware of the relationship between Harry and Nola. Well, I’m not going to spoil it for potential readers by explaining why I feel strongly about this but there’s a give away clue running through the book that none of the locals seem to have worked out. Or have they? In the final section of the book, it all suddenly switches up a few gears, and it becomes apparent that quite a few of the large cast have been hiding secrets of their own. It’s full-on from this point to the finish with revelations heaped one upon the other, to the extent I half expected a gathering of the town population to be called so that the truth could be walked through in front of the full ensemble.The whole thing is told in jumpy fashion, both in terms of the order of events and from whose perspective the story is being told at any given time. Though, actually, this does work quite well once you get used to the style. But it’s certainly rambling and quite repetitive, and I can’t help feeling that quite a bit of material could have been cut and a more finely crafted end result might have materialised.If you can live with it’s flaws, then you’ll probably extract something worthwhile from it. I’m not sad I spent some time with this book, but I doubt it’ll be amongst the best I read this year.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""Spectacularly terrible!

Como lectura de camastro es triunfal.Dios santo… podría empezar a enumerar la cantidad cosas que están tan mal en este libro, pero… No, olvídenlo. Mejor sí las voy a listar.¿Qué es lo que hace a un libro bueno? Y estoy hablando de ficción de género, no ficción literaria. En realidad, siendo totalmente objetivos, para que un libro sea ‘bueno’ tiene que exceder las expectativas en tres cosas muy pequeñas: trama, prosa y caracterización. Y nada más. No es algo tremendamente difícil de entender. Sin embargo, Dicker tiene fallos en cada una de las tres, aunque en su favor voy a decir que donde menos tiene es en trama.Antes de entrar a mencionar lo que hallé en cada uno de los anteriores conceptos haré una nota sobre la ambientación. Aquí viene el mayor error de la novela: se nota a leguas que Dicker no es estadounidense. Todavía si hubiera ambientado su novela en cualquier otra parte del país habría pasado mejor, pero la ambientó en Nueva Inglaterra y vengo llegando de leer dos novelas de Stephen King casi en sucesión. Dicker tiene una idea de pasada de la idiosincrasia gringa, y parece que está escribiendo para alimentar la idea que el europeo promedio tiene del estadounidense. Sus comentarios sobre los hechos políticos del país parecen sacados de una leída superficial a Le Monde. Además, comete errores: Harry se la pasa mencionando tener miedo a la silla eléctrica… en un estado que no ha ejecutado a nadie desde 1939 y que si bien es retencionista de la pena capital, su método legal es la inyección letal (esto me tardó dos minutos buscarlo en Wikipedia). Como consecuencia de todo esto, al libro no le ha ido bien en Estados Unidos (Penguin ni siquiera lo publicó en pasta dura!!). Cada vez que nos sintamos apabullados ante la cantidad de libros que leen los europeos, sólo hay que recordar que por cada Larsson y cada Pérez-Reverte o Posteguillo hay un Jonas Jonasson y un Joel Dicker.La prosa es bastante plana y sin gracia. No sé si haya algo de ‘traductor traidor’ en mi edición, pero aún así por puntos falta descripción: el pueblo de Aurora carece completamente de sentido del lugar. King ya nos ha llevado a Nueva Inglaterra muchas veces, y cada uno de sus pueblos tiene vida propia. Aquí no. Otro fallo de la prosa es que por puntos es púrpura a matar (El obvio homenaje a Nabokov N-O-LA vs. L-O-L-I-T-A es desternillante). Los diálogos entre los personajes carecen de gracia y chispa, y a veces llegan a ser verdaderamente acartonados.Caracterización: La gran virtud del género de misterio, en su variante clásica, es su caracterización curiosa, minuciosa, ligeramente absurdista. Una especie de comedia humana donde el ingenio resuelve crímenes cometidos por fallos fundamentales de carácter. Y en su variante hardboiled o negra, la caracterización es chillante, sobreactuada. En el libro no encontramos ninguna de las dos: encontramos personajes de cartón. La madre de Marcus es un estereotipo judío tan manido y forzado que me recordó a la madre de Howard Wolowitz en Big Bang Theory. Gahalowood es planísimo, además de poco creíble (¿Tan fácil van a dejar que un civil se meta en una investigación así como así?). La familia Quinn es un cliché, así como lo es ese pobre tipo de Luther Caleb y peor aún Stern. Baranski, cliché. Rothman, cliché. No voy a decir que Marcus Goldman me pareciera un personaje insoportable, porque al final reconozco a mucha gente y a partes desafortunadas de mí en él: he vivido y trabajado con overachievers ya demasiado tiempo, y en la mayoría de los casos me provocan un bostezo. Sobre el amigo del título, pues el gran problema es que pasamos a pies juntillas que es un pedófilo y no se explora ‘el origen del mal’ (chiste!).Trama: como decía, donde Dicker comete menos errores. Aun así voy a notar un par: el primero es que, si bien los giros de la trama son súper hábiles, son demasiados. Me recordó a Elantris, el primer libro de Brandon Sanderson, donde se notaba que era su primera novela por el exceso de giros cuando ya no debía haber más. Son demasiadas codas: cuando parece que va a terminar, ahí va otro giro. Hay una línea muy delgada entre la genialidad que debe mostrar todo escritor de misterio para confundir al lector y la ofuscación que provoca estarlo zarandeando. Dicker, me temo, cruza esa línea. Otro error es que una de las subtramas (para no spoilear, tiene algo de psiquiátrico) es demasiado… jalada. Rompió para mí la suspensión de la incredulidad.Y la cantidad de cosas que sí están bien con este libro fundamentalmente son dos: la primera, que sospecho es la que le granjeó los premios que le granjeó, es el manejo de la metaficción. Un libro que cuenta la historia de un escritor escribiendo un libro que habla sobre un libro, y al final el primer libro es el libro que la trama describe que se escribió (¿Entendido???). En general considero difícil que a uno le salga mal este recurso, y casi siempre es garantía de buena estructura. Aquí la estructura es bastante trabajada, a muchos tiempos, con intervalos e insertos que tiendo a preferir para darle más sustancia al libro. Entonces kudos por ahí.La otra virtud, y aquí me detengo, es que Dicker sabe muy bien cómo escribir un ‘ripping yarn’ o una madeja que se desenrolla. Es decir, un libro que uno no puede soltar. Repito: uno no puede soltar el libro. Es el peor libro que uno no pueda soltar que he leído. La lectura fundamental para leer en la playa, en la alberca, en las vacaciones. La lectura fundamental para recomendar a familia y amigos. En este sentido, triunfa. Y triunfa bien. Yo sí voy a andarla prestando por ahí.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""I said it before and I'll say it again, or write it again, whatever, but this book is about 150 to 200 pages too long. It's too long, but my biggest issue with it isn't the ridiculously unnecessary length, it's the way the story is contrived and the way the characters interact that bugged me the most.Is Dicker trying to write a modern version of Lolita? Is he going for a new spin on The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo? Is he trying to write a sprawling murder mystery or is he trying to write a new literary classic that rivals Nabokov, Roth, Joyce, whoever. Maybe I'm just out of touch with the formula that works in Europe since this won a bunch of awards over there. I don't know.It started out so well. I liked it in the beginning. I thought it was cool that it danced between different time periods, different conversations, different characters past and present. I even liked the addition of Goldman's struggle to write the book within the book although that became uninteresting as the story played out. The structure was cool, the mystery unfolded pretty well, all that was fine. There was enough there to keep me reading.Actually, it was kind of interesting that the book was hard to put down when I was reading it, but I could also put it down for days at a time and not miss it. It was hard to put down and hard to pick up at the same time. I don't know that I've had that experience from another book before, at least nothing that comes to mind right now. Tonight, I was determined to plow through it and get to the bottom of the mystery, and I did, and it was fine, but I ultimately didn't enjoy the book.Some stuff that bugged me:1. The way Marcus meets Harry was stupid. It wasn't enough to convince me that he cared so much about him later in life. It felt like a really uninspired way to build their relationship, and I didn't get enough from it to think Marcus should be this invested in his case.2. The over-the-top, sappy, gushy romance. This is no Lolita, and maybe it thinks it is, but it isn't. Harry sounds like a fifteen year old who is in love with another fifteen year old. It feels so juvenile that I think my eyes might still be rolling... getting dizzy... oh boy....OK, I'm fine. I couldn't take the way Harry talked about Nola. It was stupid.3. Good Lord, is every male in the story a pervert?4. We figured it out! Yay! Nope, just kidding. Wait, we solved it. Nope, tricked ya! Hey, here's the suspect! Nope! The last third of the book felt like watching pro wrestling where the good guy keeps hitting his finishing move but the bad guy keeps kicking out just before the referee can count to three. Oh, so close! He almost had him! But then it's like the good guy was wrestling the wrong guy the whole time so the analogy eventually breaks down until... RKO OUTTA NOWHERE!5. Did I mention the book is unnecessarily too long? I really think Dicker wanted to hit a home run with a literary masterpiece which is hard to do when you're trying to also write a page-turning murder mystery. I don't need a break from the action to talk about how hard it was to write the book for Marcus or Harry's advice on being a writer. Just keep peeling the onion for me.This thing had some potential, and I did enjoy the story at times, but things just broke down for me once I got over the halfway point, and I couldn't make excuses for it anymore. I didn't understand the negative reviews in the beginning, but now... now they all make sense to me.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '¡Este libro es alucinante y es mejor que lo lean sin que sepan absolutamente nada de la trama!Así que, dicho esto, les daré unas cuantas razones para que leanLa Verdad Sobre el Caso Harry Quebert:1.

If this should bring the reader to stand on the edge of the chair because he/she wants to know thing happens, well, it does not works.Because the only emotion that this work tries giving me is nuisance. And not is the nuisance from ""oh-my-god-i-want-to-know-thing-happens"". No, is the nuisance from ""still? Again this plot? There isn’t another way to create suspense?"".There are many things that piss me off:1. a book that has won prizes should have at least a good way of tell events, emotions, facts, feelings. Here is all blank because of the colorless writing, pure narrate of actions, plain dialogues.There isn’t characterization of characters. How do you think to write a love story without investigating the soul of his protagonists?2. lack of psychological deep, then. In a book that is long 779 pages it is impossible. This book is cataloged between novels, then nope, there must to be feelings. And I’m not talking about the phrases in Wichita Harry says that he loves someone, that the love is the only reason for live ecc. No, i mean that the characters, while being seen from of outside, must express at least in gestures what they think. There aren’t descriptions. Now, i understand that we cannot read the mind of Harry, being already all it written from point of view of Marcus. But that there are at least the feelings of Marcue! If only the narrator wrote his thoughts! your master is imprisoned and you not say anything, no feeling? Regret, anger, resignation, contempt, disbelief? The nothing absolute?3. and then, you ask why the people are looking you badly when you defend him? Knowing that a 35 year old loves a fifteen years old and has no regret?She can be her daughter! And you aren’t surprised!? As if it was normal.3. The gigantic ego of Marcus. He Wrote a book, has had success, has spent all what has earned and complains why, after two years in the luxury, doesn’t have more money. My dear Marcus, rarely the writers have lived as pasha thanks to books. You have written a book, a best seller, then do not complain if, to gain more money and to continue your precious life, you will have to work. If your dream is to live of writing, and not do anything else, don’t cry because of a writer slump. You wanted that.4. when i readthe mist of Avalonby Marion Zimmer Bradley I hated Genevieve. She Is the only character that i detested form the beginning to the end, because of her coquetry, her superficiality, her stupidity. In this book I hated everyone. The women / girls thought only how to catch Harry Quebert because he is rich and because he should be handsome. Nola, the girl, and Jenny, the waitress, have the eyes covered with ham, they are distant years from reality, they live in a fairy world in wich their desires rides the actions of other people. Wrong. In fact before or then they’ll understand. The mother of jenny and the mother of marcus are from strangle. Two geese.5. the inquiry. Oh, men, the inquiry. When does the police let investigate a writer, a public citizen? When ? Not Even in the tv series happens: incastlethe writer must have a permission and be always accompanied by officers. I have no words. And where are the police officers? They Appear on scene only towards the half of the book.7. I have to say that the last eighty pages are well made. However, in a 779 pages long book is not enough.8. please, if you want to write a book on one writer-detective, do not take example from this. Do all you want, but not copy this shame. Its unreadable, a accumulation of conversations that have not sense, only empty words. Accompanied with insipid, arrogant, stupid characters.I could write 31 points, as the advices, BUT HEY, o have one life, and I’m tired of this book. Then adios book, I’m searching better novels that make me feel something. Goodbye, marcus goldman, I’ll never see you again. 👋🏼—————🇮🇹«Fuggite, sciocchi!»Commento breve:Inizio intrigante, secondo quarto indigesto, terzo quarto insopportabile, ultimo quarto metà insopportabile, metà accettabile.Personaggi stupidi, egocentrici, superficiali, avventati, insopportabili.Storia romantica inaccettabile, storia letteraria inconsistente, storia gialla che si riprende nel finale.Un gran flop.Commento più approfondito (possibili SPOILERS):Andiamo con ordine.Ogni capitolo inizia con un “consiglio” che il famoso Harry Quebert dà al suo pupillo Marcus durante la sua vita. Ogni consiglio occupa una pagina.Spreco di carta.Volti pagina, quella a sinistra è vuota, quella a destra inizia direttamente parlando del presente. Ad un certo punto iniziano a comparire incursioni nel passato che, spesso, escono nel bel mezzo di importanti scene narrative ambientate nel presente. Se questo dovrebbe portare il lettore a stare sul pizzo della sedia perché vuole sapere cosa succede, beh, non funziona. Perché l’unica emozione che questo artificio narrativo mi fa provare è fastidio. E non è il fastidio da “oh-mio-Dio-devo-sapere-cosa-succede”. No, è il fastidio da “ancora? Di nuovo questo escamotage? Un altro modo per creare suspence non c’è?”.Ci sono molte cose che mi hanno reso indigesta la lettura.1. Un libro che ha vinto dei premi prestigiosissimi dovrebbe avere almeno un buon modo di raccontare avvenimenti, emozioni, fatti, sensazioni. Qui è tutto banalizzato da una scrittura incolore, quasi insipida, che non va oltre il puro narrare di azioni, riportare dialoghi.Non c’è un minimo approfondimento del carattere dei personaggi, neanche dello stesso protagonista, CHE VUOLE SCRIVERE UNA STORIA BASATA SU UNA STORIA D’AMORE. Come si fa a pensare di poter scrivere di una storia d’amore senza indagate l’animo dei suoi protagonisti?2. Mancanza di approfondimento psicologico, quindi. In un libro che è lungo 779 pagine lo trovo impossibile, almeno che non si tratti di un manuale sulla criminologia. Ma questo è catalogato tra i romanzi, quindi NOPE, ci devono essere per forza dei sentimenti. E non sto parlando del fatto che Harry continui a dire di amare qualcuno, che l’amore è l’unico motivo per vivere ecc. No, intendo dire che i personaggi, pur essendo visto dal di fuori, devono esprimere almeno nei gesti quelli che provano. Qui nessuna descrizione del genere compare.Ora, capisco che non si possa leggere nella mente di Harry, essendo già tutto lo scritto dal punto di vista di Marcus. Ma che ci siano almeno le sensazioni di Marcus, e che cavolo! Sei il narratore, esprimi dei pensieri! Il tuo maestro viene incarcerato e tu non esprimi alcun sentimento? Dispiacere, rabbia, rassegnazione, disprezzo, incredulità? Il nulla assoluto?3. E poi, ti chiedi perché le persone ti guardano male quando lo difendi? Sapendo che un TRENTAQUATTRENNE è stato con una QUINDICENNE e non si è sentito in colpa, se non per un brevissimo periodo di tempo?Non capisci che la gente non giudica l’idea di assassinio, che ancora non è provato, quanto il rapporto tra un uomo ed una ragazzina che potrebbe essere su figlia? E ti sorprendi? Come se fosse normale. Non siamo più al tempo degli antichi romani, andare a letto con una minorenne è reato. E tu che fai, Marcus? Neanche ne parli con il tuo “delizioso” (pffff) maestro.3. Per non parlare dell’ego smisurato del protagonista. Ha scritto un libro, ha avuto successo, ha speso tutto quello che ha guadagnato e si lamenta perché, dopo due anni nel lusso, ora non ha più soldi. Si dà il caso, caro mio, che raramente gli scrittori hanno vissuto da pascià grazie alle entrate dei libri. Hai scritto UN libro, non decine di best seller, quindi non ti lamentare se, per avere altri soldi e per continuare la tua vita, prima o poi dovrai lavorare. Se il tuo sogno è vivere di scrittura, e non fare nient’altro come lavoro, non lamentarti poi di un blocco dello scrittore. Perché te lo sei cercato.4. Quando ho lettoLe nebbie di Avalondella Bradley ho odiato il personaggio di Ginevra. È l’unico personaggio che ho detestato dall’inizio alla fine, per la su civetteria, la sua superficialità, la sua stupidità. Ecco, qui tutti i personaggi sono così, odiosi. Le donne/ragazze pensato solo ad accalappiare Harry Quebert perché pensano che sia ricco e perché dovrebbe essere un gran Figo. Nola, la ragazzina, e Jenny, la cameriera, hanno gli occhi foderati di prosciutto, solo lontane anni luce dalla realtà, vivono in un mondo fatato in cui pensano che i LORO desideri comandino le azioni degli altri. Sbagliato. Infatti prima o poi lo capiscono. La madre di Jenny e la madre di Marcus sono da strozzare. Due oche.5. L’indagine. Oh, signori, l’indagine.Quando mai la polizia lascia indagare uno SCRITTORE, un pubblico cittadino? Quando mai? Neanche nelle serie tv accade: inCastlelo scrittore deve avere un permesso ed essere SEMPRE accompagnato dagli agenti. Qui no, tutti dicono tutto al nostro carismatico e rompipalle Marcus, così, perché ha un bel faccino. Io boh, non ho parole. Ma poi, scusa eh, ma i poliziotti dove sono? Compaiono sulla scena solo verso la metà del libro. Neanche cercano di fermare Marcus dal ficcare il naso nelle indagini.6. L’inutilità di intervallare i consigli d’autore con le scene di Marcus che non riesce a scrivere e, ogni tre o quattro pagine, ricordare che “ehi, io starei facendo un’ndagine, scriviamo qualcosa a proposito“. Come se non fosse il soggetto principale del libro.7. Ammetto che l’ultima ottantina di Pagine è ben fatta. Qui si è visto il volto poliziesco del libro. Però in il libro di 779 pagine non basta.8. PER FAVORE, se volete scrivere un libro su uno scrittore-detective, non prendere esempio da questo. Fate tutto come volete, ma non copiare questo obbrobrio. Non si può leggere, un accumularsi di conversazioni che non hanno senso, non hanno spessore, non dicono niente, solo vuote parole che possono dire tutto o niente. Corredate da personaggi insipidi, arroganti, bisbetici, presuntuosi, stupidi. Non c’è nessuno che si salvi.Cavolo! Potevo fare 31 punti, quanti sono i consigli del magnifico Quebert, ma ehi, io ho una vita, e dopo un po’ mi stanco di lamentarmi di un libro, passo avanti, non mi fermo a piangere sul latte versato. Quindi ciao, vado a cercare altri romanzi belli bellissimi che mi facciano chiudere il libro, accarezzare la copertina, sorridere e sospirare. Addio, Marcus Goldman, a mai più rivederci. 👋🏼'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'ENGLISH (The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair) / ITALIANO""Somerset Police. What’s your emergency?""""Hello? My name is Deborah Cooper. I live on Side Creek Lane. I think I’ve just seen a man running after a girl in the woods.""The present: a promising novelist, Marcus Goldman, deals with his first writer\'s block. The past: a promising novelist, Harry Quebert, deals with a forbidden love with a 15-year-old girl named Nola. The crux of the matter: past and present are intertwined with the mysterious disappearance of Nola.Going on with the reading, the feeling is that each resident of Aurora has something to hide. In this respect, Aurora is likeTwin Peaks, fictional town of Washington state in which the homonymous cult TV series of the 1990s is set. A little bit ofVladimir Nabokov\'sLolita, a little bit ofChristopher Isherwood\'sA Single Man, so many influences. Not a masterpiece in my opinion, an excellent and enjoyable thriller, though.Vote: 7,5""Centrale di polizia, qual\'è il suo problema?""""Mi chiamo Deborah Cooper, abito in Side Creek Lane. Credo di avere appena visto una ragazza inseguita da un uomo nella foresta.""Il presente: un promettente romanziere, Marcus Goldman, alle prese col suo primo blocco dello scrittore. Il passato: un promettente romanziere, Harry Quebert, alle prese con una storia d\'amore proibita con una quindicenne di Nome Nola. Il nodo: passato e presente si intrecciano attorno alla misteriosa scomparsa di Nola.La sensazione che si presenta quando si è avanti con la lettura è che ogni abitante di Aurora ha qualcosa da nascondere. In questo senso Aurora è un po\' comeTwin Peaks, luogo fittizio nel quale è ambientata l\'omonima serie culto degli anni novanta. Un po\' diLolitadiNabokov, un pò diUn uomo solodiIsherwood, le influenze sono tante.

Mediamente hanno lo spessore della carta velina, agiscono senza coerenza e imbastiscono dialoghi sul nulla (i dialoghi sono tremendi, davvero).Il giallo non è un giallo: non semina indizi, non permette un'indagine o una riflessione al lettore: le cose capitano per caso senza un filo logico. Il problema principale, infatti, sta nell'incapacità dell'autore di seguire l'impianto narrativo scelto: il risultato sono ripetizioni e, contemporaneamente, buchi narrativi.Riassumendo: un compitino autocompiaciuto pieno di boria mal eseguito. In una parola, ditelo voi...""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'I have mixed feelings about this book. The fact that it won the ""Prix de l\'Académie Francaise"" 2012 tips the scales towards disappointment. Then again if I was not intrigued by a crime book that won the said prize, I probably wouldn\'t have even picked it up.It is a 660+ pages crime book; that made me quite hesitant to consider it, I just assume there would be unnecessary details and characters and boring repetitiveness. I was wrong about the first two.The book\'s back cover states that it is a ""reflection on America"". I don\'t know how one understands such a phrase, nevertheless it felt to me a bit too much to qualify the book as such.It is the story of a first-time successful young writer, Marcus Goldman, struggling to start his second work, who flies to the rescue of his mentor, the great Harry L. Quebert. Quebert is arrested and accused of the murder of the 15-year old Nola Kellergan, whose body (or the remains of it) is discovered 33 years (2008) after her disappearance (1975) from a small New Hampshire town, Aurora.The book\'s front cover is a painting by Edward Hopper, one of my favorite painters, ""Portrait of Orleans"", and this book is certainly a portrait of Aurora. The inhabitants of Aurora seem typical of any small village; endowed with the natural virtues and vices and small-town life; they are friendly, nosy about each other\'s affairs, yet understanding, even respectful, of each other\'s privacy (if such a privacy exists in a small village), and as is the case in any small town, and especially those described in crime novels, newcomers almost always carry a deeper past with them.Though the book is more action than description, yet the characters and the events occuring in the past are chronicled in such a way that one feels as if he was part of that fateful 1975 summer.What felt a bit unsettling, in my opinion, was that the recalling of past events did not create in me this feeling of mystery one anxiously anticipates following the deep-digging in crime novels. I even felt that the paths that led our amateur detective-writer to snatch bits of truths about what happened from the dwellers of Aurora were too ""programmed""; it was as if people awaited in their houses, or diners, or stores for the arrival of Marcus to recount him in precision what happened 33 years earlier. Over the lifespan of the book, I could count rare occasions in which characters seemed suspicious, or wary or cautious of the questions and deductions thrown-in by Marcus Goldman.As the case is closed, every little twist of events is lucidly narrated by Goldman/Dicker so much that the imagination of the reader is left thirsty. This is because, throughout the book, Dicker retells the events from the perspective each and every actor directly or indirectly related to the crime, which generates so many overlapping narratives leaving no room for guesswork.As the detective-writer finds himself entangled in the twists and turns of the book he is simultaneously writing, the reader is offered an entrance to the world of book publishing; there is a most revealing chapter of the book, chapter 6, that completely takes the charm out of the book publishing process. Nevertheless, it is revealed in such a way that I found it quite funny to read.Overall, I enjoyed the book; it is an easy read of the simple lives of simple people in an average small town. I particularly appreciated that an author can still up an addictive crime novel without the bells and whistles of forensic science and technology, and rely on the simplicity of the characters to elucidate the mystery.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'أعمالنا تحددنا بقدر ما نحدد نحن أعمالنافهل قسوة تجربتك الإنسانية تجعل كتاباتك اقوي؟ام ان موهبتك وحدها تكفي لتتالق و انت محبوس في جزيرتك الخاصة؟هاري كيوبيرت مدرس و كاتب يقرر ان يذهب لبلدة ساحلية نائية ليكتب روايته الثانية؛و هناك يعامله اهل البلدة كالابطال الفاتحين؛ و يدللونه؛ و لا يتفاعل معهم حقاً الا سطحياً عدا نولافتاة في الخامسة عشر؛ تحاصره بحبها و اهتمامها لنبدأ قصة تشويق معقدة تبدا و تنتهي في شهرين صاخبين بالأحداث؛ و نسمع تفاصيها من الكاتب و هو متهم بقتل الفتاة بعد ٣٣ من لقاؤهما و يحاول تلميذه الكاتب الشاب ان ينقذههي الجرايم لماذا لا تسقط في الغرب ابدا؟هل يصح او طبيعي ان اجد ان كل المشكوك فيهم مابين الستين و التسعين؟رواية شايبة جدااذا استمرت روايات التشويق الحديثة علي نفس درجة التعقيدات لاستكراد القارئ باي شكل؛ مهما كانت الجرايم عبثية و بلا هدف؛ بل و يتشارك فيها خمسة ستة بلا تردد؛ شككت في بعضهم لكن.. ما الدافع؟فانا ساعتزل التشويق الاستفزازيفالقصة كانت مقوماتها جيدة حتي قرب النهايات؛ كأن الكاتب اصابته لوثة عقلية لادانة الكل.. جمعاءفنجده يتطرق فجأة في اخر فصول ل الشذوذالبيدوفيلياالاخويات الجرائميةطرد الارواح الشريرةالفصامالسرقات الادبيةحتي صار اخر الرواية مسرحا هزلياً للجرائم'}]"

The writing in this book was so mid like 😭 the author just went on writing the same thing over and over again until we reached the last bits which was supposed to be mind blowing but came off as too predictable. I did enjoy the first 80 to 100 pages to be honest but then the constant push and pull and the way the author filled this book withtoo many quotesthat they didn\'t even hit like they should and 😭😭I cant even start at how tropey it waslike surely you cannot write all the tropes in this book and expect all of them to hit the readers the same way. It just got so claustrophobic in there that I wanted to finish it.Paedynour FMC 😮\u200d💨 I really liked her in the first book but I was so frustrated when it came to her character in this one, dont get me wrong I still enjoyed reading her point of view but I feared that my eyes would be stuck at the back of my head if I read Paedyn saying""I would not hesitate to kill him next time""and not doing that the next time one more time😭 because saying it once or twice makes sense but more than that and you look like a fool which unfortunately Paedyn did look like for majority of the book. It\'s that I thought with how things ended in book 1 Paedyn would put up a little bit of fight and she did for like 80 pages but then it vanished?? and I hated that so much.Kai, I enjoyed his point of view as well and I did have fun reading about him and I liked that we got an insight of his past, I also liked his flirty nature and the way he would speak of her and his dialogues in general but when you\'re sent out to kill her and you\'re trying to be string enough to do thatYOU DONT START FLIRTING WITH THEMbut I had almost very little complaints with Kai because even poor writing can\'t do Kai wrong. As forKitt, I found his pov similar to how I felt Apollo\'s pov was in ACFTL.....boring and unnecessary.The plot was where?? for a romantasy there was barely any fantasy in it.Dont get me wrong, if it was a full romance book it would\'ve been an easy 3.5-4 starsbut as a romantasy it failed to deliver on anything but the romance and even a part of that was annoying. The author said that this book was abuild upto the third book but there was honestly nothing building up until like the last 30-50 pages and I am not even lying when I say this thiscould have been a 100-150 paged novella if we keep in mind the important things that happen and if you want to add more romance to that but dont want to overfill it 200 pages at bestand it would have been perfect, would have had us at the edge of our seats and would have given us some actual content in one go rather than it being dispersed among filler scenes and it would\'ve been more easy to write and would have given Lauren more time to focus on book 3 so she could have delivered a massive finale. A little bit of this book was about Kai going after Paedyn (100 pages at best) and then it was them trying to go back to Ilya. The ending I saw coming because I honestly saw no other suitable way to end this book and basing it off peoples reactions my suspicions were confirmed so even for what most peopled saved this book, failed for me.The romance, I did enjoy the dialogues exchanged, the tensions and angst at times (until it got too much) and some of the cute moments that they shared but one thing that this book lacked was slow burn because everything happened so fast and wasnt this supposed to be enemies to lovers?? what I read was definitely not enemies to love it wastwo people being in deniallike the constant push and pull was fun at the beginning but it got so tedious because it was the same thing repeated until the end and I wanted scream at them. I wanted more slow burn like yes the first book was slow burn enough but when you end powerless saying that Kai would be going out to kill Pae you would expect more fresher slow burn and thats why I did not really love the first kiss, it was written well but I just didnt like how fast it happened. It could have happened later on as well. I do admit that there was angst and tension but it didn\'t hit me. I liked the development the character got through romance but theres this thing called balancing a book and there was no balance here and tbh if I wanted that I would have just picked up a romance novel instead of this.I did enjoy some parts of it and I liked Kai + the fast paced nature of this book and I can see people who only want KaiPae romantic moments would really enjoy this book but honestly I wanted that but only to an extent with balance, political intrigue and a plot because otherwise I would\'ve just read When Gracie Met the Grump which is sitting right beside me.Overall, A disappointing experience and im hoping that the conclusion redeems itself with more Mak scenes.~~~Look what just came in the mail 🙈•Buddy reading with the one and onlyRoxy'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""➺ 3 stars“Hate me enough to make me want you.”This has to be the longest I've waited for a book and NOT enjoyed it. This one was supposed to be angsty with bittersweet moments, a proper development that does justice to the story, but there wasn't any! Kai was basicallyuseless, Kitt wassleepless, and pae ofc ispowerless.➳ This book didn't fail to deliver the cutest scenes ever, the dancing, the team-up, the rain scene, and much more, butIT FAILED TO DELIVER THE PLOT.I'm sorry, but the whole book revolved around or had to revolve around Kai finding Paedyn, which he did after a week? And all the struggle he did here, was just to keep her with himself because she keeps running away.ALSO A BIG EXCUSEEEEEMEEEEE TO THE ENDING *rolling my eyes rn*➳ I was bored of the dramatics, the sentences were overused. The characters were way too indecisive.'I have to kill him, I won't hesitate again' – Paedyn after not killing Kai for the 1000th time, even after getting 1000 chances.'It's my duty, my mission to bring her to Ilya' – Kai after flirting and taking care of Paedyn.➳BE FREAKING FOR REAL FOR ONCE?😭 I was promised angst, and those first 4 chapters delivered a little bit while the rest was just like book 1 – which had little action. It's not a fantasy book; it was normal ordinary people surviving because no power elements were mentioned here.There is no plot development in all those 300 pages.If Lauren wrote this book for Kai and Paedyn's relationship development, then she succeeded, but this brought no progress to the story at all.Paedyn being injured for the majority of the book BUT if you touch her, she'll beat yo ass and hand it to you back... then she'll realize AGAIN that she's injured.The ending was predictable, wayyyy too predictable that even my theories were better than it! I focused too much on details and made BETTER theories but I doubt that there's any type of mystery. I didn't like how it unraveled, and Kitt's chapters were boring, he's good but his character will either be ruined or he becomes better ✋🏻➳ I'm giving three stars becauseI truly do love Kai, and Paedyn is a likable character too.They're really fit for a sweet romance book because they're the best together. Just for the sake of the non-existent plot, the push and pull was annoying the fuck out of me at one point. If it weren't for the end, I would've said that PAEDYN DOES NOT FEEL THE WAY KAI FEELS ABOUT HER. There's no balance. But yay, I survived!!I had some theories: like paedyn's father died because he was somehow involved in Ava's sickness (as he was a healer and used to visit the palace), and the treason, the king talked about, was about this and not about the resistance. also, Paedyn might be a MIX and not an ordinary, and is somehow related to Ava's sickness 😭 or her powers were not working because of her father's ring. ahwjshs nvm my mind was working a lot but nothing happened. we got a simple explanation“Let me dance for the both of us.”“Let me swim for the both of us.”KAI AZER, WHERE ARE YOU!!

I NEED THE NEXT BOOK RIGHT NOW 😭😭😩Let\'s get real here, this book has been getting some mixed reviews and tbf it is not you, it is most definitely the book.It is not for everyone.If you want some advances in plot? It doesn\'t really do that, that aspect is minimal. However, if you want some bonding, relationship development, and angst this is the one for you. I personally, loved that the author took time to build on Kai and Pae\'s relationship as the way the book ended felt A LOT more impactful.I loved Kai and Pae\'s POV. The way they felt about things and the action sequences were good.Kitt\'s POVhowever fell flat for me. I was expecting him to be a bit darker, but I got mildly dark at the most. But I understand he is grieving and a responsibility was pushed on him that he wasn\'t yet fully prepared for. I can\'t wait to see what he plans to do in the next book. I AM NERVOUS AFTER THE WAY IT ENDED.. HELP 😭😭😩One thing I really appreciated was Pae\'s father\'s journal. I liked the insight and the reveal cause OH MY GOSH 😩😩 I also liked to see Pae trying to cope with the loss of Adena.Kai and Paecoming to terms that they both did each other wrong. It\'s underrated. To understand someone so deeply the way these two did and people are calling their relationship development as ""nothing happened?!"" I AM SHOOK 🤯I absolutely ate up the romance. It was perfect.The slow burn, the angst, the yearning, the banter all hit. Only one bed and only one horse were nice additions. That one gambling scene in this kinda gave Feyre and Rhysand\'s throne scene in the Night Court vibes, but only make it PG13 👀🤭One thing that I was really looking forward to was Mak\'s character.I wasn\'t aware that he is supposed to be in Fearless and not this one. I was really hoping for a showdown of sorts between him and Kai/Kitt.

I felt that Roberts relied too heavily on the romantic relationship between Kai and Pae and didn't move the story along enough. That's not to say that 3 stars is a bad rating because it's not, I did love some aspects of the story.But it felt inadequate. Look, I'm all for the relationship between these two but I felt like it came across a little surface level and lacking depth considering how book 1 ended. There has to be a wider range between these two. Take us through it, gut us. Leave us in limbo for a while.The anger and resentment they felt towards each other felt like a joke. Not figuratively, literally- like hehe haha. Pae seemed emotionally flat when it came to Adena. A little less banter and 'ocean eye gazing' would have gone a long way here.So Mac just dropped off the face of the earth for this book?No sufficient mention of Adena? After the ending of Powerless and after Powerful? Pretty cold.The ending was a let down for me considering it's an easy wrench to throw into the mix.I'll come back and refine this review later - kinda just throwing some thoughts out this morning.ˋ°•*⁀➷Powerless Book 1 Reviewˋ°•*⁀➷Powerful Book 1.5 Review₊˚ ‿︵‿︵‿︵୨୧ · · ♡ · · ୨୧‿︵‿︵‿︵ ˚₊'For the reckless souls who dare to love and be loved.''This girl is the very thing I can't seem to escape- can't seem to go anywhere without the remnants of her following.

I hated kitt though… bro really thought he was the victim. I wanted to smack him upside the head. also, where was mak?? he better have a huge role in the next book lauren.‧ ₊ ˚❀╰› the romance ༉‧ ₊ ˚it was cute in and of itself, but I was expecting something different. there was plenty of paedyn and kai shamelessly flirting and simping over each other in the first book. After the ending, I expected them to actually be enemies, toactuallystart hating each other and distancing themselves from each other and give me some actual tension. But no. There were a few weak scenes where the two pretended to hate each other, and then they immediately fell back into the recycled banter that we were already given an overdose of in the first book.spoiler!even though kai literally had paedyn chained up and was taking her to her own imminent death,end of spoilerthey still flirted and cuddled and had serious, romantic moments with the weak excuse of “oh, we’re just pretending” (trying to pull off an enemies-with-benefits but they were already too in love with each other for it to work and it was added like an afterthought because even Roberts realized how unbelievable it was).we had the classic “I’m starting to trust him against my better judgment” and “somehow, we’ve become friends”, which would’ve worked fine if this was simply a rivals-to-lovers. But paedyn and kai are on opposite sides of the law. They should not have been acting like a spicy old married couple. It doesn’t really count as tension if they’re literally not even making an effort to act like enemies. Listen, I love paekai but the circumstances surrounding their romance made the entire thing so unrealistic. It isn’t enemies-to-lovers atp. It’s lovers-who-are-also-enemies.‧ ₊ ˚❀╰› the writing ༉‧ ₊ ˚there are some amazing quotes in this book, when taken out of context, but fit them in amid the rest of the writing and they seem extremely forced. Roberts is trying to pass off stuff I can tell took her a good bit to come up with as stuff that the characters just thought up on the spot, causing the dialogue to not even feel like dialogue anymore but poor poetry. She was suffocating her own writing underher own writing. I can genuinely tell that she has a solid voice but it’s buried underneath the adjectives and adverbs and double sentences with the same meanings that she feels like she has to add to embellish her writing. writing doesn’t have to be fancy and pretty. Sometimes it is, and sometimes it works. but it’s okay to have simple, invisible writing because if the rest of the book is developed enough, that’s all you need. You shouldn’t be trying to hide an underdeveloped book under pretty writing. I’m not going to forget about the glaring lack of plot just because your character just spewed some poetic nonsense.‧ ₊ ˚❀╰› (lack of) plot ༉‧ ₊ ˚lauren should’ve deleted the whole Resistance thing altogether and marketed this series as pure romantasy– because that’s what it is.recklessis 300-something pages of paekai with hardly any breaks. And to be honest, it worked. No matter how unrealistic their romance was, it was a nice escape from real life. they were cute and fun and I would definitely root for them. but there was something nagging in the back of my mind that I couldn’t ignore reminding me that it’snotjust a romance. It’s supposed to be a high fantasy with a revolution plot, one that was nowhere in sight. I guess she’s going to cram that entire plotline intofearless... good luck lol.‧ ₊ ˚❀╰› overall, ༉‧ ₊ ˚while I had a good time with this book, it didn’t live up to the expectations that I had for it and I’m kind of disappointed.

It’s captivating.Kissing her is relief.It’s a delicate sort of demand.She pulls away, panting words between each kiss. “I hate you.”“I know,” I murmur into her mouth.“No”—his fingers trail up my neck to trace my jaw—“the mistake was tasting you now that you likely won’t let me do it again.”“Jealousy looks good on you, Gray,” I murmur, my fingers still cupping her chin.Her eyes flick between mine, full of a familiar fire. “I’m not jealous.”My gaze lingers on her lips before traveling down the length of her. “Then you just look good.”“…formidable. Recklessly bold. Powerful despite ability.“I am none of those things,” I whisper.He drops my hand to brush gentle fingers beneath my chin, raising my face up toward his. “You are much more than those things.”“You overestimate me.”“No. I justseeyou.”My face is inches from his. “Oh, I can hate you just fine.”“Then hate that you feel something for me.” His hand skims my thigh while the other presses me firmly against him. “Hate me for making you want this.”“You going to kiss me, Gray, or just continue admiring what you see?” he murmurs, now running a thumb over my bottom lip.“Still contemplating drowning you, actually.” My voice is breathy, my own fingers wandering the curve of his jaw.“Oh, darling, I already am.” His lips inch closer to mine, teasing me. “And I’m begging you to let me breathe you in.”I smile slyly. “I thought you never begged?”“I’m getting used to it when it comes to you.”And then his hand slips behind my neck to pull my lips toward his.“Your heart is pounding.”“That tends to happen when you touch me, yes.”“You’re not just a mission to me. You’re not just another enemy for me to find. You’re something even more terrifying.”Her voice is a little more than a whisper. “And what is that?”“A need.”“Maybe I’m fine with being a fool. So long as it’s for you.”“The truth, then?”“The truth, always.”“Dont look at me like that.”“Like what?” she asks softly.“Like I’m worthy of being seen.”Her lashes flutter at my words. She swallows, lifting a hand to cup my face. My eyes drift closed at the feel of her palm against my skin, the privilege to be touched by her.“Dance with me?�� she whispers.“For however long you want, darling.”Laughter seems to stutter in my throat, as if unsure whether it should come out of my mouth. He reaches over and gently flicks the tip of my nose, making me giggle in a way I didn’t know I could.“Plagues, I love that sound,” he murmurs, making me fall silent. “I would tattoo it on my skin if it meant you’d laugh at me for doing it.”He closes the distance between us, tilting my chin up so I meet his gaze. “You asked me what my favorite color was once. I’d never even pondered the answer to that question before you.

Do I haunt your dreams, plague your thoughts, like you do mine?'babe, i don't know but this book will be the main character of my nightmares the next seven business days at least.・❥・ Mood of the book: ...I should hate you by Gracie AbramsThis was absolute bullshit.End of the review.……. Still here?Well, welcome,I welcome you to the most dull and useless book you are going to read in your life,this review is going to be completely spoiler-free,since I am not going to bother explaining what it is about or go into specific details, because to do that, something should have happened in the whole damn book, but it didn't, nothing, nada, nichts, niente. And for what? For such a shitty ending?I could literally spit on a blank page and the result would be better than this thing.I'm not going to lie to you, I'm speaking from anger and fury, because that's what this thing caused me. What's more, while I'm writing this I've decided to lower the score to one star,that star goes to Kai, because it's the only worthwhile thing about this book,him and his quotes and his flirtation.Let's start with the chronology, the first 8-10% of the book is fine, it starts off fairly strong, but from there, up to in my opinion 80% of the book, is a continuous loop of repetitive dynamics, the same thing over and over again. The last 20% of the book, okay, the dynamics begin to change,it was also time for the book to contribute something decent,but, after 300 pages of absolutely nothing, the end arrives, the tension grows and grows and keeps growing and the moment arrives and……cockblock.The book focuses a lot on romance, but I can't believe I shoved this book down my throat in one day, to literally read 4 good scenes, a few flirtatious lines, and so that when the end comes, it's this absolute shit.I think the author wanted to surprise with the ending, and let's say she succeeded, but unfortunately, not in the way she expected. I felt violence inside me while reading the ending, and.. just why, Lauren Roberts? I think she saw all the complaints about how predictable and plagiarized the book was and said: oh yeah? Well you'll see, how about...this???The answer is NO, this is horrible, disgusting, harmful to look at.Well, after releasing the venom that I carried inside me about this atrocity, I can return to my hiatus of reviews due to the exams,will I read the third one?Well of course, firstlybecause I'm a masochist,obviously, and second because I need to know what the hell she's going to do after this mess.ೃ⁀➷ 𝓹𝓻𝓮 𝓻𝓮𝓿𝓲𝓮𝔀:04/07/24:this was a whole lot ofnothing!!im so fucking mad rn.02/07/24:ok let’s go 🙂\u200d↕️ i have seen mixed reviews about this one already, i hope it’s better than powerless 🥲""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'i have no words to describe how stupid that ending is and how excruciatingly boring this entire book was. i would’ve have way more fun watching paint dry for 48 hours straight.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""|| 1.0 star ||This managed to be so much more disappointing than I could have ever imagined. I was really hoping the author would write the emotions, depth and angst well, especially after where she left off with the previous book, but she managed to do everything exactly wrong.First of all, I found it so off-putting that they kept on bantering with each other in every single situation, from beginning to end. They’re supposed to feel immense betrayal, yet they just keep on quipping quirky little one-liners towards each other? It’s not what I was expecting or hoping for. I wanted to feel the intensity and the angst between them; not this silly bit of almost-anger that hardly seemed to matter to either of them. Their entire relationship was just so superficial, it made me lose all interest in it.Even more: Where was Kai’s guilt? Where was his desperation to win back her forgiveness and affection? Sometimes his inner-monologue seemed like he cared, but he treated her so callously and cold. Like he didn’t even care that she hated him now… He didn’t fight for her whatsoever.And she didn’t even seem to mind that he didn’t grovel or beg or show remorse; she weakly kept lusting after him anyway.Furthermore, I absolutelydespisedthe fact that Kai seemed to act like he had any right to anger. Like he was the one who should feel betrayed or hurt. He acted like she wronged him instead of the other way around. The hypocrisy of it all pissed me off so badly.She’s alluring in the way most deadly things are. It’s captivating. No. No, it’s terrifying. It’ssupposedto be terrifying, still thinking of her as something I’m trying to deserve. Still deeming her worthy of my desire. But she’s not. No matter what has already happened between us. She’s my prisoner and my mission. She is nothing to me.Worst of all, the fact that Kai kept putting his “mission” above saving her, loving her, earning her forgiveness, was insanely unattractive. Him acting like an aimless lapdog to his father and now to his brother was just pathetic.I mean, this dude has been slaughtering innocents for years because… what? Because he couldn’t say a simple “no” to his evil daddy? PATHETIC. And now he’s willing to do the same thing to the girl he “loves” for the new king, his brother, just because he’s told to? PATHETIC.There’s seriously nothing less attractive than a man who’s willing to throw the girl he loves to the wolves because it’s his “duty” to listen to his king. I mean, where is his duty toher? Where is his sense of courage or protectiveness?? Absolutely nowhere.“One landmark closer to my death.”I look away to the street below us, not wanting to think about the possible truth in her words. I hate that I don’t know what Kitt plans for her. Or worse, what he plans for me to do to her.Is it bad of me to say I almost want her to end up with Kitt now? At least he was somewhat interesting and seemed to have actual emotions that went further than teasing and bantering. Most importantly, at leasthenever intended to murder her and give her up for his “duty”. Nope, he’s just straight up going to save her and all the other Ordinaries by marrying her. Like, I’m sorry, but am I supposed to pick the guy who never fought for her and was willing to let her die (and even killed lots of other people just like her) over the guy who’s going against everything and everyone to have her as his bride and do what’s right? Because I think not. I’m going with Kitt here.My life is not my own. And, for that reason, she can never be mine.Anyway, this entire book was just a giant disappointing mess that didn’t even come close to living up to its potential. The whole thing was nothing but repetitive and silly banter; there was no actual plot or any form of development. Everything stayed the same from beginning to end, and we basically saw the same scene play over and over again. It was annoying, superficial and boring.The 'Powerless' trilogy:1.Powerless- 3.0 stars2.

I’d never even pondered the answer to that question before you. And yet, I realized in that moment that it was blue. It is your eyes.

Dimples that make me—““With each kiss, he captures the three words I’m too scared to say. I hope he can taste them all on the tip of my tongue, read them on the curve of my lips. Because uttering the words feel like a death sentence. Every person I’ve ever loved has left me. I’m cursed to lose in love. But that is what I feel for him, what I’ve felt even when I hated him. Because hating him was easier than hating myself for wanting him. So i bite my tongue. I fight the urge to shout those three seemingly harmless words at him. Because wherever I love, people die. And I’d rather love him silently than mourn him loudly.”“No, I’m sick of running. And I won’t spend the rest of my life doing it unless it’s you I’m running back to.”“Then I’ll spend the rest of my life tracking you down. Glimpsing you in the shadows. Fighting you in the streets. Dancing with you in my dreams. Because living without you is only bearable when I know you are out there still living too.”“You are my proof of a paradise.”AND THAT PLOT TWIST AT THE END THOUGH??! 😭😭😭 I HONESTLY SAW IT COMING. AT LEAST KITT DIDN’T ORDER KAI TO KILL PAE OR ANYTHING, BUT STILL?? DOES THAT MEAN KITT WAS PART OF THE RESISTANCE ALL ALONG?!! HE WOULD’VE KNOWN CALUM WAS A RESISTANCE MEMBER, RIGHT? OR WAS CALUM A TRAITOR?? I’M HONESTLY SO CONFUSED 😭”Ladies and gentlemen of the court, let me reintroduce you to who it is that kneels before you. This is Paedyn Gray. Once a contestant in the Purging Trials where she ranked quite highly for a Mundane. And to think a Psychic became such a threat to Offensive Elites. But she isn’t exactly what she seems. Not only was your Silver Savior an Ordinary in disguise, but she was a traitor under our noses. Paedyn, do you confess to not only being a Resistance member, but to conspiring with them as well?”“Yes.”“Not only that, but do you admit to… killing the former king of Ilya?”“I do.”“This woman—Paedyn Gray— has committed atrocious crimes. She killed my father, your king, plunging his own sword through his chest before her dagger through his throat. She conspired with the Resistance, a radical group of Ordinaries, helping them find a passage into the Bowl Arena. She lied. She killed. She betrayed. And I have grieved. I have stepped suddenly into the role of your king while still mourning the former. And, yes, my reputation as a crazed king has reached my ears. But I assure you that my future decisions are anything but crazed. And I will explain them all to you in due time. Paedyn Gray… Stand. You are to be my bride.”i genuinely have no idea what to expect forfearlessnow, but istg if pae and kai don't get their happy ending, i will actually BAWL.“I think I’m drowning. But not into her blue eyes like I happily would. No, I’m sinking into the floor, letting it swallow me whole. I can hardly breathe under the crushing weight of Kitt’s words. My ears ring. My heart pounds. The command echoes in my skull, though I have no idea why he would want this. Why he would want her. Not now. Not after everything. I’m surrounded by the entire court and the only thing I can focus on is not falling to my knees beside her. Marriage. Marriage to someone who isn’t me. Marriage to someone I will spend the rest of my life serving. I’ll lose her forever while being forced to watch. I can’t even look at her. I’m a coward, morphing back into the monster I was when she found me. My vision is blurry, eyes fixed on the dais above. This is how I lose her. Not by death but by something just as binding. The command rings in my head. And to think I wasted so much time trying to hate her. To think I won’t have enough time to love her. My heart aches because every beat belongs to her. And I may never get to tell her that. Is this how she will remember me? Escorting her to this fate? Bound by duty alone? I could laugh. I could cry. I could burn this palace to the ground like I did her house, just for a chance to confess my love before the flames consumed me. Because I am bound to her very being. Hers until the day she realizes I don’t deserve to be. The king’s eyes are on me while mine are somewhere far away. Somewhere with her. A place where I am nothing and no one and happy being powerless, so long as she is beside me. My gaze falls from the fantasy, finding its way to her. This is not how I will remember us. Not as enemies or traitors or monsters, but as two people dancing in the dark, swaying beneath the stars. Her feet atop mine, her head on the heart that beats only for her. Just Pae and Kai. I step away from her kneeling form, masking every emotion with a blank stare. I’m leaving her to face him. Her future husband. I melt into the crowd, standing at a safe enough distance to prevent myself from stealing her away. This will be the rest of my life. Forced to love her from a distance. Mourn the loss of her each day. But I will. I will smother every emotion but the one that belongs to her. I will love her until I am incapable of the feeling. She is the torture I may not survive. Eagerly, she is my undoing. Her gaze lifts, meeting eyes that are not my own. Eyes of the man who gets to have her—if she allows it. She was supposed to be my forever. Now I’ll watch her become someone else’s. Because the beast doesn’t get the beauty.”pre-read 🌹🌿:I’M SO FREAKING EXCITED AAAAHH!!!

There is kind, handsome Willem, an aspiring actor; JB, a quick-witted, sometimes cruel Brooklyn-born painter seeking entry to the art world; Malcolm, a frustrated architect at a prominent firm; and withdrawn, brilliant, enigmatic Jude, who serves as their center of gravity.Over the decades, their relationships deepen and darken, tinged by addiction, success, and pride. Yet their greatest challenge, each comes to realize, is Jude himself, by midlife a terrifyingly talented litigator yet an increasingly broken man, his mind and body scarred by an unspeakable childhood, and haunted by what he fears is a degree of trauma that he’ll not only be unable to overcome—but that will define his life forever.","[{'rating': 3, 'content': ""5 THINGS I LIKED ABOUTA LITTLE LIFE(AND 5 THINGS I DIDN'T)Everyone’s talking about Hanya Yanagihara’s Booker- and National Book Award-nominated blockbuster novel. There are lots of 5 star raves on this site. Many people are saying it’s one of the most incredible books they’ve ever read. I hate to be the outlier or considered cold-hearted (I’m not! I cry over books and movies ALL THE TIME!!!). The book took me just under 2 weeks to finish, and I’m glad I read it. I liked it, I really liked it! But I also didn’t. Here’s why.THINGS I LIKED1. The power of friendshipIf this book had a theme song it might be the Beatles’ “With A Little Help From My Friends.” Four roommates at an Eastern college move to the Big Apple and become huge successes: J.B. becomes a hip downtown artist; the well-off Malcolm is a well-known architect; Willem goes from waiter to movie star practically overnight; Jude is a lawyer, first at the D.A.’s office and then at a prestigious corporate firm, where he works himself up and becomes a partner.Over the decades, their friendship endures, through spats, early career struggles, J.B.’s drug addiction and, most of all, dealing with the effects of Jude’s unspeakably abusive past on his current life, although Jude is terrified to tell anyone about that abuse. The novel is also refreshing in its depiction of race, gender and sexual orientation.2. The depiction of the effects of abuseMy one major takeaway from this book is a fuller understanding of the after-effects of systemic childhood abuse. Jude, an orphan raised at a monastery, the first site of his sadistic stations of the cross, feels absolutely worthless. He cuts himself (if you’re squeamish, you’ve been warned). He bangs himself against walls. In one particularly harrowing scene, he sets himself on fire. Beyond that, he can’t trust anyone and doesn’t feel he’s worthy of love, even though as an adult he gets nothing BUT unconditional love (with one notable exception). For the people who adore him (not just J.B., Malcolm and Willem but Harold, his former law professor, who, with his wife Julia, adopt Jude at age 30, and Andy, the most supportive physician on the planet), this is beyond frustrating. A good one-third to one-half of the book recounts all of that.3. The way Jude’s brutal past is layered into the storyYanagihara expertly weaves the story of Jude’s abusive past into his present-day narrative. And in the character of Brother Luke (especially), she understands how abusers manipulate.4. J.B.’s artThe descriptions of J.B.’s art projects, from his early, experimental pieces as a student – one involves collecting people’s real hair – to the shows that get him attention and fame, all feel authentic. My only question would be the scope and range of his work. The subjects of his art all seem to be his friends. Really? He has no other interests? Or is this merely a comment on #1 (above)? [Side note: the cover photo for the North American edition is brutally powerful: it’s called Orgasmic Man, and captures the feeling of ecstatic turmoil vividly.]5. The proseObviously a book has to be decent to keep you absorbed for over 700 pages. Yanagihara knows how to string you along. Jude has problems walking – he’s vague in his description about how this happened – and once she plants the idea of Jude’s abuse, she makes you wonder what EXACTLY happened to him. And as with any coming-of-age book, you want to know where they end up.THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE (PLEASE DON’T HATE ME!)1. The total lack of historical contextCharacters use the internet and cellphones, but no world events occur. The only things that register are the friends’ cultural milestones: JB’s retrospective, Willem’s movies (which, incidentally, all have horrible, unlikely titles), Malcolm’s buildings, Jude’s cases. There’s something incredibly narcissistic about this. Seriously? Nothing on 9/11? The economic downturn didn’t affect Malcolm’s Upper East Side family? J.B. is of Haitian background; were any relatives affected by the earthquake? No one – not one friend, colleague, etc. – is dealing with HIV? (We’re told Jude’s body is riddled with disease, but never get the details.)2. The implausibilityNot only is Jude a top-notch litigator, but he’s also a brilliant mathematician. AND an excellent pianist. AND a singer of lieder. During school (full scholarship), he has a job at a bakery (oh, he’s also an amazing baker). So… when - and HOW - did he learn how to play piano and study German art songs? Seriously. I want to know. What bothers me is the assumption beneath all of this. Does he have to be so good at all of these things for people to love him? If someone has been abused and ISN’T as accomplished, isn’t this person just as worthy of love and understanding? For that matter, WHY do people love Jude? I don’t get it. All he seems to be doing for the entire book is saying, “I’m sorry.” Which brings me to...Why are these guys all friends, again? Cuz they went to the same school? We don’t get enough about their early years to know what solidifies their friendship. Yanagihara just TELLS us they are friends, and we have to accept it. For 700 pages. Which brings me to…3. The RepetitionThe book needed more serious editing. It could have lost 250 pages easily. About ⅓ of the way in, I thought, somewhat heartlessly (I know, I know), “Imagine taking a drink every time Jude says ‘I’m sorry.’” I’d love to search how many times that phrase pops up, as well as the word “shame.” Just saying. Weget it, Hanya.4. Lifestyle pornNot only do all four friends become enormous successes in their fields, but they’re constantly jetting off to exotic places (Paris for the weekend? Why not?!), buying up lofts (stylish and trendy downtown, of course, NEVER uptown) and having Malcolm decorate them in the best Architectural Digest taste. And then there’s the cultural snobbery. I howled when Willem was going to film Chekhov’sUncle Vanyaand ALL OF HIS FRIENDS KNEW THE CHARACTERS FROM THE PLAY. I’ve seenVanyaseveral times, and even I don’t know all the characters in the play.5. Black and white charactersI’m not talking about race, here. I’m talking about people who are either ALL GOOD or ALL BAD. We’re all somewhere in the middle, but not in Yanigihara’s universe. Which made me think that the book needs to be read as a fable, an urban fairy tale, not realism. Is that why there are no historic markers? Because this is some Dickensian book set in chic SoHo? I don’t know. But if these people who we spend so much time with had more shading, I’d probably have liked – and BELIEVED – it a lot more.***Final thoughts: obviously Yanagihara has tapped into something serious and profound with this book. I think people are responding to it because in some way we all feel damaged, used, unloved – although not to the extent that Jude does. Most of us learn to overcome our insecurities and move on. He's that terrified child we all carry around inside ourselves, saying we're no good, we're not attractive, we're not worthy of love. I just wish all this had been done with a bit more subtlety. Life isn't so black and white. Yanagihara should know that, as we get older, we learn to accept, and live with, fascinating shades of grey. And that if she had brought out those complex greys, the book would feel more authentic and less sentimental.""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""Some believe that this is “The Great Gay Novel.” That couldn’t be more wrong. There are only two recognizable gay men in this work, JB and Caleb. A creative queen and a violent, probably psychopathic, sadist. All the other “possibilities” are pedophiles (categorically not gay—that’s a sickness, an evil, that has nothing to do with being gay) or so hopelessly confused (and impotent) that you can’t know what they are (JB and Willem). The take on gay men here is antediluvian—a dangerous and discredited brand of heteronormative delusion in which all gay men, no matter the glittering surface of their lives, are fated only to die a lonely, miserable death. Caleb dies an excruciating death (so we’re told) from pancreatic cancer. JB, the witty, flamboyant, unstable, creative queen is merely a plot point. His happiness, told but not shown, at the bitter end doesn’t mean anything more than that. He’s a device to wring one more regret from you, one more sorrow. You can be assured that he, too, will die an ignoble death just beyond this novel’s last page. And you won’t be troubled or offended or titillated by the gay sex (or really any sex) here because there isn’t any: it’s the sex that dare not speak its name. All this is because the author knows absolutely nothing about gay men other than the most superficial stereotypes and doesn’t have the imagination to venture deeper than that. She can’t even imagine that a man (Willem) doesn’t need a woman to quench his sexual needs—he has a solution readily at hand.Some people believe this is a novel about friendship. That also couldn’t be more wrong. The author warns you early on [225] that friendship is nothing but the slow drip of miseries. This book is not about friends, it is about enablers. All the main characters are there specifically to enable Jude, which is precisely what destroys him. Were they his friends, they would never have let things progress the way they did.Some people believe that a strength of this book is that the author's presence is not felt. This also couldn’t be more wrong. There is absolutely nothing here that is not the author’s presence. It is all tell and no show. The characters are cartoons. They can’t grow. They can’t surprise. All they can do is grind the meticulous plot forward. They are not here for any other purpose. They aren’t really characters at all, just cogs in a machine.Every novel demands, by necessity, some suspension of disbelief. But no novel can be unbelievable. But that’s all we’re told. Four adolescents are thrown together as suitemates at a highly prestigious Cambridge college (wink, wink) and we’re told, not shown, that they effortlessly go on to become the best, the most famous—trial lawyer, actor, artist, and architect. The actor and architect might squeak by as believable, but not the trial lawyer, not the artist. From what we’re told about the trial lawyer, it’s impossible to reconcile his catastrophic, constricted, precarious little life with the cold, predatory, expert were told he is. From what we’re told about the artist, it’s impossible to believe, even in New York City’s insular and provincial art world, that the same series of portraits from photographs of the same three men over and over and over again will raise him to the top of that art world. The artists, the real ones, the author cites are all mediocre; the one she tells surely must be likewise.Moreover, we’re told that that men, all men, have a permanent, genetic, stunted repertoire of emotion, have a tiny emotional toolbox. And that their character is fixed at some ill defined state in their past and beyond that no change can ever take place. Growth, change, redemption—all are denied. Thus, we don’t get characters, we get cartoons. Cardboard cutouts. They are here only to satisfy the deliberate plotting. They are only means to the author’s ends, nothing more.And to add to the unbelievability: the villains, puerile: the pedophiles—Catholic clergy, Dickensonian orphanage counselors, a homicidal psychiatrist, long-haul truckers, a vast nationwide network of solitary and group child predators; and, of course, the brutal, violent gay psychopath. Even granting evil is banal, this is beneath banal. Cartoon. Cardboard. What’s lacking here, and elsewhere, everywhere in this novel, is any imagination beyond just that: the banal; the puerile; the stereotype.Not to dwell on the unbelievable, but it permeates this book. Nonexistent syndromes. Nonexistent legal cases. Hyenas that climb trees. And over and over and over the doctor, Andy: he fails every duty of care, everything that physicians stand for, believe in, dedicate their lives to—he’s there only to enable. He doesn’t report what must be reported, not just legally but morally. And, of course, plot over believability, neither do any other of the medical professionals, doctors and nurses, a legion of them through whose care Jude passes. They all turn a blind eye to the evidence of his abuse, his self abuse. Andy neglects to mention the very real and virtually insoluble problem of phantom pain when he explains amputation to Jude, but then just that develops post-op, only to be brushed aside a few pages later. It doesn’t work that way. (And, really, it would have meshed perfectly with the author’s plot. Another failure of imagination?) And, fundamentally: physicians don’t treat their friends, their family. That’s a recipe for disaster. Unless disaster is precisely the aim.And I just can’t let it go: lunch at obviously Le Bernardin, Willem without a jacket. No way. No man dines there who is not wearing a jacket. And especially not an actor, no matter how famous. Here, I guess, the point where the author did let her imagination run wild.And I’d be remiss not to mention the language. Suited to its task. Occasionally it seems almost to take flight, but when it does, it seems more appropriate for a glossy travel magazine. And it almost always tries to take flight in just such a milieu: Bhutan, the Alhambra.Most people think that this 720 page novel is too long. Way too long. But imagine what it would be were it the size of most all contemporary novels, 250-350 pages, more or less. Half or less what it is now. What would it be? Even more obviously the ridiculous cartoon that it is. The length is intrinsic to this work. It is long, patiently and meticulously plotted. The very length is part and parcel of its purpose. The reader made to suffer, one with the gears of the plot. That’s the whole point.The leitmotif is sorrow. Everyone is always saying “I’m sorry.” Over and over and over and over again. Of course, thus sorrow loses all meaning, becomes trite. But meanwhile the author is carefully and meticulously adhering to the through line, everyone will suffer, every character, the reader. It’s nothing but melodramatic manipulation.So what is this after I’ve rambled on about what it isn’t? I think it’s a masterpiece of a new kind, joining closely related genres such as mommy porn and the venerable bodice rippers: this is authorial sadism. The author is a “literary” (if you can dignify her as such) dominatrix. Every character set up to fail, no possibility of redemption, growth. And the person who suffers the most in the end is the reader. Set up to be crushed. Again: that’s the whole point.All of us are the stories we tell. No less the novelist.If you read this book and found it amazing, I’m sorry.If you haven’t read this book, don’t.""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Fuck this book.And it started out so well! The writing is actually gorgeous. I can see why many, many people like this book. Really, Hanya Yanagihara knows how to use language. Unfortunately, the story she told was not worthy of it. The longer I read this book, the more I dreaded reading it, the worse my feelings got as I read, and the more I hated it for existing. Then I read a bunch of interviews by her and hated the book even more.The long and short of it is that this book is nothing but misery porn, on purpose. (Here\'s a Vulture interviewwhere she talks about the inspiration for writing the book to create a book version of ombré cloth, which if you\'re not familiar, by the time you get to the end is pitch black. Yeah, let\'s make art that will stain our souls!!!!!)This book.Nothing in life is positive, there is only human suffering, true connection is impossible, predators will always find and ruin truly good people, everything is evil, the people who love you are not enough to save you, and your happiness will turn to ashes in your mouth. The End.Fuck. This. Book.There is a lot more that I could say about this book but I don\'t think I have enough time or space. Other people have criticized more articulately the implications of the way Yanagihara treats her gay characters, who exist seemingly only to suffer (while paradoxicallyothers have praised it as the great gay novel). She also stated in several other interviews her desire to write a character so broken he couldn\'t be fixed, which she accomplishes in her protagonist Jude. Some have called this a melodrama, and that seems accurate. Everything is over the top, but stated in such bald and beautiful prose that it doesn\'t feel that way at the time. Instead, these larger than life events are made to seem trite and commonplace. Yes, there are bad priests in the Catholic church. Yes, the church covered this up. Do I think it\'s likely that an *entire abbey* (the whole thing!) full of Franciscans (the most peaceable and loving sect in Catholicism) would not only participate in child molestation, but condone it openly? Hell no*. One more ridiculous thing in this book on top of another. If it\'s unlikely and causes Jude lots of pain, just put it in this book!*UPDATE 5/23/24: I am about three condescending comments away from closing my comments on this review altogether, but specifically please stop telling me that systemic abuse exists in the Catholic church, I KNOW IT EXISTS AND IT IS BAD. My point in referencing this is that it was just one more thing on top of everything else ridiculously implausible in this book that is taken way too far, and thus makes any eliciting of emotion impossible for me. I get that people like this book and it\'s their baby or whatever, but my not liking this book in no way harms you, a person who did like it. Stop condescending to me, thanks!The real deal breaker for me was when I paused midway through the novel to readan interviewwhere Yanagihara stated her criticism of psychiatry as a way to treat mental illness. The implication that some people are too broken to help and we should just let them die is so, so harmful, and in no way does it help to eradicate the stigma against mental illness in this country. We should not be telling ""broken"" people it\'s okay to die. We should be telling them they are not alone in their suffering, and help them find ways to cope with their illnesses and traumas. I will admit I checked out of the book then, and it was only a matter of time before I gave up and spoiled myself on the rest of it, so I wouldn\'t have to torture myself mentally any further.Glad I did, because the end of this book is a big rusty nail up the butt.This one from the London Review of Books ismy favorite review of the book I\'ve read so far. Let me quote my favorite part:""He wishes he too could forget, that he too could choose never to consider Caleb again. Always, he wonders why and how he has let four months – four months increasingly distant from him – so affect him, so alter his life. But then, he might as well ask – as he often does – why he has let the first 15 years of his life so dictate the past 28.""The answer, of course, is that it’s Yanagihara’s design. That’s why it’s good to know that Jude is entirely her concoction, not a figure based on testimony by survivors of child rape, clinical case studies or anything empirical. I found Jude an infuriating object of attention, but resisted blaming the victim. I blame the author.A Little Life has received some ecstatic reviews. The most intriguing of these is the novelist Garth Greenwell’s in the Atlantic, which argues that it’s the long-awaited ‘great gay novel’: ‘It engages with aesthetic modes long coded as queer: melodrama, sentimental fiction, grand opera,’ he writes. ‘By violating the canons of current literary taste, by embracing melodrama and exaggeration and sentiment, it can access emotional truths denied more modest means of expression.’ Perhaps I’m in thrall to current literary taste, but the only character in A Little Life who seems possessed of anything like ‘emotional truths’ or a sense of irony, the only supporting player in this elaborately ethnically diverse cast who doesn’t seem like a stereotypical middle-class striver plucked out of 1950s cinema, is JB. He’s temporarily ushered out of the narrative after he says to Jude: ‘You like always being the person who gets to learn everyone else’s secrets, without ever telling us a single fucking thing? … Well, it doesn’t fucking work like that, and we’re all fucking sick of you.’ JB’s also the one hooked on crystal meth. What real person trapped in this novel wouldn’t become a drug addict?I think what makes the most angry about this book is that I do see flashes of brilliance in it. Images I loved, earned emotions. Early on in the novel, one character muses about being a guest in his own life. Another talks about photography in terms that made me stop in my tracks and pause the audiobook just so I think about what she\'d written. Later, the relationship between Jude and his adoptive father and the love his adoptive father has for him made me cry. But all of that doesn\'t matter, when the end result is what we\'re given.What it comes down to the fact that pain was the only point, and I think that is reprehensible.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""[1/28/24 update: If you liked this book, great. Glad it works for you. Then, this review clearly isn’t for you. In case you would rather list down in the comments all the reasons you love this book rather than read the review, here’s the main point = booktok and bookstagram spent years recommending this book left and right with no trigger warnings. Let’s not pretend otherwise. Conversations can be made without invalidating other people’s opinions.]I don’t want to read a book written by an able-bodied person on the suffering of a disabled person without the research and nuance. You are allowed to love this book (I don’t though) but don’t close your eyes to the fact that this is an able-bodied person writing about how a gay disabled character “never gets better”…. I don’t like what that says.Everyone keeps saying “books don’t need to have a happy ending” and that’s why people dislike this book. But it’s not the reason? Atleast not for me. This book could have the saddest ending for all I care but what matters to me is how it got there. And reading through a friendship that we didn’t even get to watch grow, was not it.The biggest trigger warnings for this book is self harm, rape, (child molestation, child prostitution), suicide. Check the ending of this review for more. AndI don’t care if you consider trigger warnings as spoilers because keeping someone from experiencing episodes and relapses is more important to me than your “plot twists” and your “enjoyment”. It needs to be said and it needs to be normalized because I don’t want to imagine even one person going through what I went through reading this book, or worse. So I hope that if you’re hyping this book up and someone asks you why it’s so depressing, you can tell them about it’s trigger warnings and keep from openly saying that it’s a “worth it read”. I’m tired of people recommending this problematic book so easily.this book should never be recommended lightly.And should be read by those who are in the healthy headspace to do so.I was wrong to think that this was going to be about friendship, it's not.which was half of the reason I started this, and the full reason why I thought I would still love it despite the endless list of all the most trigger-able content.I thought we were going to see the development of this friendship or at least get to know why their found family was/is as solid as it supposedly was. And we never got to see that.I really don't know why people keep emphasizing it but I'm here to tell you that it isn't and I was gravely disappointed when I realized what this book was really about. Some characters were used as plot points and some where used to make you feel guilty... at worst, they were added for the shock factor.Before I say anything else, if you didn’t already know,the author herself said that she wrote Jude without doing any research and that he came to her “fully formed”. Given that the author isnot1. A disabled person and 2. A gay man bothered me the whole time I was reading this book. If you are going to write about mentally sick disabled gay man, you should at least do research about… well, all of those if you’re going to be writing about highly sensitive topics. Most especially when you pack so many traumatizing things into one book.In another interview she said that the reason that she writes about men is because she thinks that they aren’t as good in expressing their emotions as women. And I don’t know with you but that’s a red flag to me.hmm… so… this was grueling to read and I was extremely triggered the whole time I was reading so there’s that. I read the trigger warnings about this book before reading it but i didn’t realize that it so strongly focused on self-harm and self-destruction as much as it did. As someone who has battled with self-harm, it’s going to be incredibly upsetting and hard to read if you aren’t ready. I know it was for me. No one really emphasized that part when I was going through reviews and I do see why since it could be seen as a “spoiler” but I think we need to stop equating trigger warnings = spoilers. . It keeps people from having to read triggering content, like what happened to me, that could result to relapses. I could feel my mental health going somewhere I didn’t want it to.This book wasn’t for me but I know a lot of people loved it. More thoughts in the future (maybe) because it’s currently 1am and I very tired.Somewhat Full RTC!!— NO RATING —⇢content warnings// Ableism (violent), Child abandonment, Child abuse, Child death, Child molestation, Child rape, Drug abuse, Domestic violence/abuse, Eating disorder, Emotional abuse, Gaslighting, Grooming, Lesbophobia (unchallenged), Manipulation, Pedophilia, Physical abuse, Prostitution, Racism, Rape, Self harm (graphic), Sexual abuse, Sexual assault, Suicide ideation, Suicide Expand, Transphobia (misgendering)————————kat from @paperbackdreams said that bridge to terabithia is nothing compared to this and i am nervous because i’ve watched/read that more times than i can count and have sobbed each time————————maybe I should wait to read this for a time when I'm feeling a little happier so that I'll have a heart to actually break""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""I am angry that this book exists, I am angry that this sad, sick, shoddy fantasy is being treated as award worthy literature, that I was duped by it into an unearned emotional response.I have written a long, episodic review already on my blog (https://iamreadingthereforeiam.wordpr...), which is too long to cut and paste, so I will try to summarise everything that is wrong with this book.I think the biggest problem with A Little Life is that Yanagihara clearly has no interest in the real lives of real people, in what it is really like to be a victim of child abuse, to be poor, to be disabled, in what gay men's lives and relationships are really like, so instead, she made it all up. A Little Life exists in a nonsensical parallel reality where New York City exists in a constant ahistorical state of now, with no Gulf wars, no 9/11, and no humanitarian or environmental disasters, while the rest of America is stuck in the 1950s, but with full wireless internet access.If a Little Life were not bad enough in itself, the things Yanagihara has said about it make it so much worse. Yanagihara originally said she was only interested in writing about suffering, and that she had not done any research into child sex abuse. Later, she wrote a very condescending piece about 'Upsetting the Reader' as some kind of meaningful pursuit, and after that claimed to be fulfilling some kind of public duty by forcing us to confront the depths of human cruelty.Yanagihara has also said some very unpleasant things with regards to mental health and suicide, which, combined with the very unpleasant messages in the book about consent and victimisation, make the whole project morally dubious.It is very obvious that Jude is a puppet, created by Yanagihara to suffer, and suffer in very specific ways, and to that end the whole story is so contrived and nonsensical that it has no meaning, the only cruelty we learn about is Yanagihara's.The first contrivance is Jude himself, the idea that no one would want to adopt him as a baby makes no sense; he is described as having green eyes, skin that turns bronze in the sun, and straight brown hair, this apparently makes him 'too black' to adopt.Next is the monastery itself, that Jude was left there in the first place, when it was not set up as an orphanage, that he survived past infanthood, given how violent the monks were, that they didn't just call social services to come and take him away since they resented him so much, that an order dedicated to poverty resented the cost of one more mouth to feed, that an order of Franciscans spent no time praying or meditating or doing community outreach (the monastery is written more like a farm, I suspect Yanagihara did no research on that either), that all the monks are brilliant teachers in subjects like mathematics and Greek, that Jude never seems to have any Catholic faith to lose, despite being raised in a Catholic order.The shear incompetence of all the police, doctors, teachers and social workers who come into contact with Jude after he is rescued from Brother Luke is ridiculously contrived as well. Somehow he receives no psychiatric care after Brother Luke or after Dr Traylor, and he has incompetent doctors who don't understand child sex abuse, and who think it is appropriate to lecture a raped child about the need to disclose his STI status to future partners. The state school Jude attends while at the children's home takes enough of an interest in him to move him up four grades and arrange extra classes for him at the local community college, but takes no interest at all when he tries to run away and is beaten so badly he is hospitalised, and no one at the hospital sees the need to get the police involved either.Yanagihara created Jude to suffer in very specific ways, all the 'compensations' of his adult life are there to keep him alive and suffering longer (and really, who has such solipsistically dedicated friends in real life anyway?). At college, Jude meets Andy, a doctor willing to treat him privately and for free, thus avoiding any messy reality spilling in, or Jude being committed for his self-harming behaviour. Also, despite Jude's childhood abuse being filmed and photographed in the age of smartphones and the internet, none of those images reappear in his adult life, and despite being in a same-sex relationship with a Hollywood star, he is never chased by the paparazzi, and never has a reporter digging into his past.Even Jude's relationship with Willem is abusive, Willem is effectively raping Jude (Jude feels like he can't say no to sex, even though Willem is supposed to be his best friend), and it feels like it is only there to drag Jude's torture out to the bitter end.What is all this for, what does any of it mean? It induced an emotional response in me, I was left feeling like I had been passed through a meat grinder after reading it, but with hindsight and reflection, it's meaningless, it is wallowing in meaningless nonsensical suffering for it's own sake, and he tells us nothing about the human condition.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'A Little Lifeis a strong contender for the award for themost depressing book I\'ve ever read. I swear I\'m not even exaggerating.At this point, I\'m not certain whether this is a positive or negative review. There\'s no doubt that this book is beautifully-written and contains some of the most raw and honest prose I\'ve ever had the pleasure or misfortune of reading, but it\'s alongvery long character study - over 700 pages of misery, substance abuse, self-harm, sexual and psychological abuse (and its aftermath), with very little of that ""light"" promised in the blurb.There\'s a section of this book called ""The Happy Years"" and never has a title been more misleading, if you ask me. But let me give you some idea what this book is about first. It starts with four young friends moving to New York - poor and uncertain of themselves - and trying to make their way. The characterization of JB, Malcolm, Willem and Jude is, to put it plainly, marvelous.They are such complex, well-crafted individuals with their own passions, hopes and fears.While the book details the lives of all four of them, Jude finds himself at the centre of this story, influencing the lives of his three friends. The more you read ofA Little Life, the more you realize that it is really a novel about Jude, and the other three characters - though important - are secondary to the story of Jude\'s journey from a childhood full of sexual abuse to an unhappy adulthood.Those promised ""The Happy Years"" are some of the most heartbreaking chapters I\'ve ever read. I readanother reviewwhere the person said she had to put the book down because this part of the book was too close and personal. To quote the reviewer:I feel like someone shoved their hand in my torso and started stroking my organs while a therapist sits there observing and then asks me, ""now, how does that make you feel?""I know what she means. It\'s brutally, painfully honest. It makes you feel like you\'re witnessing something you shouldn\'t be in the relationship between Willem and Jude. And, by the way, it is one of the most interesting, strange and truly depressing relationships I\'ve ever encountered. The fear Jude feels that this relationship will be pulled apart by his own problems is palpable, and the lengths he goes to in order to conceal his issues made me so sad for him.But I can foresee the future onslaught of negative reviews that call this book ""torture porn"". It is so helplessly bleak. Everything bad that can possibly happen to Jude seems to happen and even when he finds someone to love him in his ""happy years"", that too is tainted by his past.Also, I find that very few books actually need to have this many pages. Almost all books over 600 pages seem too long to me, with many scenes feeling like they weren\'t needed and should be cut out. While I appreciated the depth of the character development, I\'m certain that at least 100 pages of this book could have been shed without losing any emotional punch. Some of the character development felt dragged out way too long; one instance that comes to mind is the descriptions of JB\'s art - from his time building models out of hair, to his paintings - I feel like my understanding of JB and his relationship with art could have been achieved in far fewer pages.This is one of those books that brings a whole lot of genius to the table but very little real enjoyment. It\'s long, slow in parts, and very VERY depressing. But if you are not put off by the length and the dark subject matter, I would say it\'s the kind of book that needs to be read. It\'s the kind of book people will talk about and it\'s the kind of book that has you saying ""this is the most ________ book/relationship/characterization I have ever read"".And that really is kind of amazing.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Tumblr'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I slept with this book after I read it. I kid you not: I held its bulking, hardcover bound 700 pages in my arms as I fell asleep amid a raging storm. I refused to letA Little Lifeleave me. Its brilliant writing, its broken characters, and its bleak, unforgiving story dug into my heart, into the very pores of my skin. As a twenty-year-old, I felt both so young and so old upon finishing this novel, as if its sheer humanity aged my soul while making me appreciate all the years I still have left.A Little Lifefollows four friends after they graduate from a small, prestigious Massachusetts college: Willem, a kind and talented actor; JB, a sharp and sometimes-caustic artist, Malcolm, an aspiring architect at a well-known firm; and Jude, a mysterious and intelligent litigator. What looks like an average bildungsroman turns into an intense and tragic tale when we learn about enigmatic Jude's backstory. Abandoned at a monastery at birth, he endured a childhood of severe physical and emotional abuse, followed by several years of sexual abuse, forced prostitution, and psychological trauma. The book soon hones in on Jude's struggle to free himself from the demons of his past, the hyenas that howl and drown out the voices of his closest, most beloved friends.This book is relentlessly sad and exquisitely written. Hanya Yanagihara spares us no mercy when revealing Jude's trauma. She details both his past abuse and his present self-harm with explicit specificity, her diction so precise and piercing it made me shake, and at times, sob. Yanagihara writes both Jude's suffering and his friendships with a keen eye. She captures the nuances of human emotion, physical space, and change over time with eloquence and heart. She writes about some of the most wretched, abominable acts of cruelty I have ever read without sentimentalizing any of the abuse or making any of the characters' feelings mawkish.Yanagihara offers us temporary respite from the pain within Jude's past by showing us the power of friendship.A Little Life's most affective moments come not from its graphic depictions of violence, but from its quiet, uplifting portrayals of compassion. While the many abusive men in Jude's earlier life show us the depth of human atrocity, Jude's tender, bittersweet relationships with Willem, Harold, Andy, and others offer to us mankind's capacity for kindness. All of these complex characters make mistakes, and through their imperfections shines their humanness.Please keep in mind:A Little Lifeis ruthlessly depressing. In the end, Jude really receives no reprieve from his anguish. As someone who has suffered his own abuse - a version less intense than Jude's, yet still real - and as someone who reads a lot about abuse, I appreciated Yanagihara's dedication to showing the darker side of reality. Trauma is trauma is trauma. And while we can all fight for recovery, sometimes that absolvement may never come. Sometimes, we just have to act with whatever kindness we have left and hope that it brings even a moment of light into the dark.Highly recommended to anyone who wants their heart both filled and destroyed. Set aside some quality time forA Little Life. It will consume you.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'It may sound presumptuous to say in January that I\'ve read the best book I\'ve read all year, but reading is a lot like love. Sometimes you just know.A LITTLE LIFE is a title with 3 meanings. First, it refers to its protagonist, Jude, a man who cannot ever accept that his life is worthwhile. Second, it refers to the act of reading it, spending time in this book is really like living a version of life.There is a third meaning, one that you don\'t discover until around halfway through the book when the title\'s words are used in a context that is like a punch to the gut. When you read them you may find yourself having a physical reaction, your stomach may flip, your skin may go cold, you may gasp for breath. And that is a lot of what the experience of reading this book is like. You can call these parts of the book words like ""awful,"" but to be real you\'d need to pull out your thesaurus and just line them up one after the other. This is not a book that is easy for your emotions. You care about the people in it, so the pain can really hurt you.You will hear that this is a book about 4 friends. It\'s not. They\'re a nice framing device, but this is a book about one person and the people who are connected to him. His life is made up of extremes. I found myself weeping over and over again because of the love and compassion and kindness that characters in the book displayed. But this book has some of the most harrowing and horrifying scenes I\'ve read anywhere. It is not really spoiling anything to say this involves terrible things happening to a child. Everyone knows from the very beginning that something bad happened to Jude when he was young. It\'s just so much worse than you could imagine. (If you have trouble reading about child abuse, it\'s probably best you not read this book. While it\'s essential to the story, it is not glossed over or referenced vaguely and what is described is truly terrible to contemplate.)Jude is not a new character. The damaged soul whose self-worth never really recovers is present in a lot of modern fiction. Yanagihara\'s trick, I think, is just how willing she is to plumb the depths of his darkness and its effects on those around him. She follows him for decades, observes him in all situations, and is unflinching in her depictions. Her writing is the kind of good that you can miss if you\'re not paying attention. You are so caught up in her story that it\'s easy to miss just how agile and careful the book is. It eases back and forth from character to character, backwards and forwards in time, and it never feels strained.I stayed up for hours to finish this book and then couldn\'t sleep because I couldn\'t let it go. I was overcome by the book and by the loss of finishing it.This is a book about love and what it means and what it can do and it is the humanity of its characters and their love for each other that will stick with me.If it was presumptuous to say this is my favorite book of 2015 since it tries to predict the future, I do feel that I can dig through the past and assert with certainty that this is one of the best books I\'ve ever read.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Note: I received an ebook copy of this book from the publisher for review consideration.Around page 150 of Hanya Yanagihara’s second novel, A Little Life, which follows four friends from their college years into their fifties, I wrote the following in my notes:I am more excited about Hanya Yanagihara and her work and her career than I have been about any author in a really long time.Around page 200 I wrote this:Is Jude’s suffering perhaps a tad overwrought? It is starting to seem like everything bad happens to him forever. Maybe we should spend some time with one of the other characters.Page 200 Jenny was right, and Page 150 Jenny was — well, hope springs eternal, and maybe Yanagihara’s third book will be back up to the standard of The People in the Trees. But as for A Little Life, describing Jude’s suffering as “a tad overwrought” is like describing Dolores Umbridge as “a tad unpleasant.” Yanagihara employs a plot strategy of which I was very fond when I was eleven, which was to think of as many dreadful fates as I could and heap them upon my protagonist one after another. Then when I ran out of ideas, I killed the protagonist off and wrote heartrending scenes of her friends-and-relations mourning her wretched life and too-early passing. I did this because I was eleven. I am not sure what Yanagihara’s problem is.We learn early on that Jude is physically frail, due to an unspecified injury in his past, and that his family isn’t in the picture. Over the course of seven hundred pages, Yanagihara unfolds a cartoonishly woeful backstory to explain all of this. When you first start to recognize the way Jude’s abusive past is tearing him apart in the present, it’s heartbreaking. After two or three wicked villains have gotten through abusing him just because they’re evil, you start worrying that if the author doesn’t right the ship, you’re going to find yourself in the unenviable position of describing a depiction of child sex abuse as silly in your eventual review.The maddening waste is that Yanagihara’s writing is elegant and evocative, and she’s able — at times — to capture with precision and delicacy the true, messy emotions between her characters. And the kind of story that she’s (I think) trying to tell is a kind of story I want to see more of. I want a story that doesn’t pretend there’s a straight path out of trauma into healing that you travel once and then you reach the end and you and your trauma have no further business to transact. I want a story that places serious value on relationships other than romantic ones. I want a story about loving someone who cannot always see his way clear to continuing to live in this world.Ideally, of course, these stories would reach me unencumbered by several metric tons of lunatic melodrama, and I would not have to use the word dreck in reference to an author I admire. But in this I am evidently destined for disappointment.'}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""“Wasn’t friendship its own miracle, the finding of another person who made the entire lonely world seem somehow less lonely?”Two months.

The exaggerated and gross cruelty. The sadistic hopelessness. That's why.I had such high expectations. And it would have been so easy to meet them. All I longed for while reading this book - and talking myself into picking it up and finishing it - was for the main character to find hope. Not happiness, I cancelled out that option pretty quickly, but the hope that happiness might be an option.

I had tears in my eyes, yes, but those were tears of desperation and hatred. Hanya Yanagihara abuses the main character maliciously, mistreats our feelings, and shows us how ugly and hurtful a single life can be.I'm not sure what people mean when they say this was a beautiful book. Possibly the prose? The setting? Sure as hell not Jude's story right? Sure as hell, not the fact that - spoiler - he literally gets fucked and crippled by countless disgusting and evil men, who make him believe that he is a worthless, ugly, non-deserving piece of trash for his entire life, so that he finally kills himself STILL convinced he is worthless, ugly and non-deserving.What kind of book is this. How far does an author have to go? Why does an author have to get so disgustingly graphic, so horrific?Yes, I admit, there were nice parts. Yes, I enjoyed the writing. Yes I loved the travels and the infinitely rich lifestyle everyone seemed to live, but which also made this book even less credible. Yes, of course, I celebrated Jude's achievements, friendships, his lucky moments. But all his lucky moments, all the love he deserved, all the friends he had, had to be taken from him. And this shattered my awe for and good opinion of this novel.This book was filled to the brim with queer pain, and frankly I'm not here for that. I don't think queer characters shouldn't be allowed to suffer, but they're owed a chance at happiness.

It's a book that kept me reading long into the night, made me turn each page with vigor and curiosity, gave me chills and shivers over the joys and sorrows of each character, and ultimately left me feeling a bit older and tortured and yet at peace with the deeply complicated nature of humanity.What Hanya Yanagihara does withA Little Lifeis nothing nearly as pretentious as that paragraph above. Somehow in 720 pages, she manages to adequately--better yet, excellently--show and make the reader experiences the lives of these young men. The novel follows four boys who meet at college: Malcolm, JB, Willem, and the central and mysterious figure, Jude. It's truly Jude's tale, but Yanagihara ends up telling each and every one of the boys' stories with ease and genuineness that makes them real.Her prose is clean and honest and revealing of the many emotions that humans experience. It's never explicitly beautiful, not flowery or overwrought with adjectives or descriptors. But it has its own beauty that comes from its ability to convey these feelings, making youfeelevery pain or happiness that Malcolm and JB and Willem and Jude feel. It's some of the best prose I've read in a while (or ever read), and I wanted it to keep going on forever.There's so much more I could say about this book. About how it hurt me to read at times--because yes, there isverygraphic material (i.e. self-harm, physical, sexual and psychological abuse, drug use) that makes the reading cringeworthy in parts--about how I fell in love with so many wonderful people in this story, about how I learned empathy and sorrow and frustration and anger for and with each of them, and how if I were to write a book I would want it to have the essence of this one.The truth is, though, I can't recommend this book to people, not without knowing them very well. Because it's a difficult journey that I can't suggest everyone take. Don't take this book lightly.

I cannot recall another that so raised my ire. An über leftist pre-meditated kumba-yah-waaah, plodding so far into the wimper-sphere that it could legitimately be considered an ironic harbinger of the kind of paternalistic elitism, against which middle America arose in vengeance, delivering us the worst leader in U.S. history.In this [Vulture piece] the author discussed how she was inspired to create a novel of ombré cloth. If you don\'t know, an ombré cloth is one that by the time you get to the end ispitch black. As Goodreads member Ashley says in her review, ""Yeah, let\'s make art that will stain our souls!!!""If I was writing this review as some sort of literary quasi-critic, I might give the book 3 stars for capable writing and full development of characters, as it thoroughly explores the devastating, lifelong impact of child abuse on the abused. According to Picasso said, ""art is the lie that enables us to realize the truth."" Unfortunately, the author\'s intentions were less than admirable in writingA Little Life.Whoever is looking for a book for enjoyment or edification: the ordeal in reading this was way more than I could bear. It is the saddest and gloomiest I\'ve ever read. A doctor who\'s read this book would have to strongly advise a patient suffering clinical depression to avoid the misery of reading it... at all costs.Understandably then--I think--when I found out that Ms. Yanagihara meant to toy with the emotions of everyone who read this, that she set out to write it in a way that would depress, oppress and dishearten unsuspecting readers, I was pissed. Would I go view a film if I knew the screenwriter\'s purpose was to inflict gratuitous pain and anguish? NO. This is different than emotions like cheer, fear, and sneers at irony. I know a horror movie\'s purpose is to scare, The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Apatow rom-coms are intended to cheer me, and movies like Gladiator and Braveheart to evoke and satiate my inner urge for justice and vengeance. I could think of novels if I had more time.Understand me when I say that I have nothing against books that are sad, if such sadness is organic to the story, Lord knows I\'ve read enough of them and they make me upset sometimes. Many I\'ve rated 5 stars. What I am referencing isintentional manipulation of emotions to compose the story tomanufacture pain. I like how Philip Roth explained the difference: “Everybody else is working to change, persuade, tempt and control them. The best readers come to fiction to be free of all that noise.Such deliberate machinations violate the implicit compact between readers and authors: for the former to keep an open mind and suspend disbelief in reading the novel, and for the latter to write a story as truthfully as possible, which means not deceptively attempting to manipulate the reader\'s emotions. To write the story with its fictive facts in a way that is honest, veridical, organic. Sure, the writer can sway with subtext and mood and motifs. Yet, I don\'t recall a writer, as did this one, who admits that her purpose in writing this book was to make the reader feel as awful and as sad as possible.Faulkner, no writer of uplifting books himself, said ""the writer\'s privilege"" is ""to help man endure by lifting his heart."" To be sure, I\'ve read plenty of sad novels (including some of my favorites); most of the great ones are, in one way or another, depressing. And yet, when I look back I can find something spiritually uplifting in each.Nothingin this novel lifted my heart.For these reasons, I\'m giving the novel 1 star. I only wish I had the option of zero.Also see: review from The London Review of Books [Review]:""He wishes he too could forget, that he too could choose never to consider Caleb again. Always, he wonders why and how he has let four months – four months increasingly distant from him – so affect him, so alter his life. But then, he might as well ask – as he often does – why he has let the first 15 years of his life so dictate the past 28.""The answer, of course, is that it’s Yanagihara’s design. That’s why it’s good to know that Jude is entirely her concoction, not a figure based on testimony by survivors of child rape, clinical case studies or anything empirical. I found Jude an infuriating object of attention, but resisted blaming the victim.I blame the author.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Where to even begin reviewing this book?

It\'storture pornat the disabled character\'s expense.This is the story of three incredibly selfish ""friends"" who are mostly so pretentious they don\'t even resemble real people.""None of them really wanted to listen to someone else\'s story anyway, they only wanted to tell their own.""^this consistent determination to be the center of attention isnotfriendship. It\'s selfish and down right narcissistic. It meant these ""friends"" consistently saw their friend struggling andnever reach out or intervene.Even worse,Jude\'s \'suffering in silence\' is glorified.This deals with extremely sensitive topics (this entire book is a trigger warning) such as rape, chronic pain, self harm, and suicide. It\'s obvious from the first chapter that Jude is suffering and his mental health continues to deteriorate-- but he never asks for help and his friends never intervene. In fact, those who reach out or \'complain\' are seen by the main characters as \'whiny\' or \'crazy.\'This establishes the extremely harmful narrative that asking for help makes you an annoyance.It\'s not accurate. It\'s not how friendship works. There\'s nothing noble about suffering alone. Friends support each other and if you need helpit\'s okay to ask for it.Beyond that, it\'s not even particularly well written. The character\'s main traits are their selfishness and pretentiousness, and other than that they fall painfully flat.The characters are essentially pawns for these heavy plot devices.Because those heavy topics I mentioned earlier? The sexual assault and chronic illness? That\'s all they are here--plot devicesso we can watch as things get worse and worse and worse and see characters lose the will to live.There\'s even aninterviewwhere the authorbrags about doing very little research:""No, I didn’t do any research; Jude came to me fully formed, and writing his sections were always the easiest. He’s a very consistent character — or is meant to be — which is, arguably, part of what dooms him.""Also where we see why her characters lack emotional depth (becauseallmen do, silly!)""I am not that interested in abuse really. But what I am interested in as a writer is the long-term effect it has, particularly in men. I think women grow up almost prepared for it in a way...But I do think that men, almost uniformly, no matter their race or cultural affiliations or religion or sexuality, are equipped with a far more limited emotional toolbox.Also:""I hope that the narrative’s momentum and suspense comes from the reader’s growing recognition — and [spoiler\'s] — that he’s too damaged to ever truly be repaired, and that there’s a single inevitable ending for him.""I can\'t tell you how harmful it is to present this narrative that people can be ""too damaged"" and (slight spoilers?) that suicide is the only answer. It\'s not just incredibly misguided it\'sactually incredibly damaging.In summary:this is a book where the main character is applauded for suffering quietly. It establishes a narrative where he can\'t ask for help-- and then sadistically pushes the story to a tragic ending. Because why? Becauseart?Buddy Read withFaye!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'A Little Lifeis a powerful, disturbing novel. It\'s full of pain, desperation, and a sense of isolating sadness that sucks the reader into some very dark places. It\'s also the best book I\'ve read in years.Reading the blurb, you\'ll get the idea that this work is about 4 college friends and their lives, but that\'s not entirely true. While each of the 4 main characters, and in fact all the characters in the book, are fully realized with extraordinary character development, the book is really about just one man, Jude St. Francis.Jude is a truly broken person; he\'s been broken by a childhood that is both a series of horrors that are difficult to read about and a testament to what a human being can endure. Jude doesn\'t come out of his childhood whole and I feel a little broken by having read about his life. I also feel that strange happiness that comes from being emotionally purged in the way that only great books can accomplish.As Alona mentioned in herreview, this is not a romance, but it is a love story. It\'s a love story about friendship that tries to overcome pain, and the bravery and sacrifice that true friendship and love sometimes require. The romance in this book is a beautiful one, but not in the traditional sense that a reader might expect or want for the characters involved.We all often say that we loved this character or that character in one of the many books that we read, I know I say it often, but the character of Jude St. Francis is something special. I loved Jude more than I\'ve loved any character before; that\'s probably why he was capable of so thoroughly breaking my heart. I wanted so much for him, I wanted him to be so much and get so much in life. He didn\'t get all that I wanted for him, but in the end, I was satisfied with where he ended up and it seemed fitting and very real.I hate the term ""triggers"", but it\'s appropriate here. I have a few triggers of my own and they were part of this book, but I felt the writing here just brought me into those places that I don\'t like to go and left me, not upset or feeling traumatized, but more appreciative of my own ability to survive and thrive. I wanted to reach into the book and take Jude\'s hand and tell him we\'d get through it together.This book is definitely not for everyone, but if you\'re up to it, you\'ll be thrilled by the writing. There\'s pain here, and beauty along with it.Big thanks to Alona for the many messages we exchanged while reading this. It sounds silly, but I feel as if the two of us have survived something together.'}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""Gave it a shot; not for me, although it may work well for others as the prose is quite inviting and the world dense and inhabited.

Sobre la soledad, la necesidad de vínculos y conexiones y de encontrar la chispa para no tirarse delante de un autobús un lunes por la mañana.","[{'rating': 5, 'content': 'qué maravilla! ha superado todas mis expectativasda exactamente lo que promete: una novela súper actual, divertida, mordaz y que creo que clava el ambiente actual de desengaño capitalista y la desazón que nos come a todas cuando nos damos cuenta de los años que nos quedan currando 8 horas al día cinco días a la semana.o como bien lo dice marisa, la prota de esta historia: ""Lo que el médico de cabecera ni mi posterior terapeuta llegaron nunca a entender es que el estrés no me lo causaba mi trabajo sino, tal y como le había dicho, el hecho de tener que ir a trabajar.

Está completamente desencantada de todo. Su trabajo es una mentira para ella. Finge ser creativa en la agencia de publicidad, donde trabaja como mando intermedio. Tiene un apaño sexual con un vecino, no tiene amigos ni vida social y es adicta a YouTube y al Orfidal.La novela está escrita en un tono mordaz y crítico, desde el punto de vista de Marisa.Hay puntos muy ingeniosos, como por ejemplo ""el juego de las oficinas"", o el ""team building"".Me ha gustado.

No todos los libros enseñan algo, es cierto, pero una historia cuyo personaje principal no evoluciona en toda la extensión del libro, en el que los personajes secundarios son principalmente mero ruido de fondo, no hay trama y prácticamente todos los capítulos giran en torno a una misma idea sin que aporte ningún fin al ciclo es... ciertamente decepcionante.Marisa no odia su trabajo. O quizás sí, pero no se desarrolla lo suficiente para saber en qué consiste la desidia que siente hacia su puesto laboral. Lo único que queda claro es que tiene depresión y ansiedad y, en vez de aceptar la ayuda de un psicólogo, acude para decidir que este no le puede ayudar y prefiere insensibilizar su mente a través de ansiolíticos que se toma como caramelos.No, Marisa, no tienes un trabajo de mierda. Vives a quince minutos de paseo de tu oficina, te pasas el día delegando tus funciones en tus subordinados y en alumnos deseosos de aprender, te quejas tener que hacer reuniones porque es la única tarea que no te puedes saltar por hacer falta de tu presencialidad, te pasas el día encerrada en un despacho aislada de todos los que te molestan en el que dedicas casi todas tus horas en hacer lo que te da la puñetera gana, te vas horas antes de que termine tu jornada con cualquier excusa porque a nadie le importa, faltas un día por una resaca y ni siquiera tienes que avisar, te quejas de tener que trabajar con compañeros ""aburridos"" cuando ni siquiera les has dado la mínima oportunidad de conocerlos y saber más allá de la capa superficial que te has inventado, tienes un sueldo que te permite darte el capricho de hacer una compra de alimentos impulsiva de más de cien euros... No, querida Marisa, no odias tu trabajo, lo más probable es que tengas depresión y no te va a ayudar a ganar la lotería porque la vida seguirá haciéndose una bola difícil de superar día tras día, que probablemente incluso se acentúe al no tener un objetivo diario que dirija tus días.El trabajo no debería definir la vida de nadie, debería ser la manera de sustentarse y permitirse llevar la vida que uno realmente quiere cuando termina la jornada laboral. No es posible en todos los casos, no entro en esos supuestos, sino en el caso de la protagonista que tiene más tiempo libre del que dedica a su trabajo, pero aún así, todo el sentido de su vida lo dedica a su trabajo.Las quejas de la protagonista acerca de las horas extra que deben hacer algunos de sus compañeros me parece de lo más hipócrita, teniendo en cuenta que ella misma delega TODAS sus tareas individuales en los demás, saliéndose antes de su hora y recordando a su asistente que lo tenga listo todo para cuando pueda. Quejándose constantemente de circunstancias que no la atañen en absoluto o que ella misma provoca en los demás. Quejándose de horarios abusivos siendo uno de sus lugares favoritos un supermercado abierto veinticuatro horas, ah... pero se le puede perdonar porque, cuando va a deshoras, se siente super culpable de estar allí, huhum.No, este libro no tiene más finalidad salvo considerar que es perfectamente normal sobrevivir una vida a medias sin querer buscar las razones del malestar mental.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '4,5*Fake itaté que as pessoas te deixem em paz. Não podemos mudar o mundo, apenas tentar que o mundo não nos mude demasiado.Ao contrário da protagonista de “O Desencanto”, não preciso de picar o ponto nem tenho um emprego das 9 às 5 onde seja obrigada a conviver com chefes e colegas que me bulem com os nervos, mas, tal como ela, preferia passar o dia esticada a ver vídeos no Youtube do que a fazer certas tarefas que me entorpecem ainda mais o cérebro do que as plataformas digitais mas que me pagam as contas.Não tenho problemas em confessar que desconfio sempre de escritores que vêm do jornalismo, apesar de algumas boas surpresas, sobretudo pela tendência para explorarem a contemporaneidade, o que vai bem com a lei do menor esforço, mas Beatriz Serrano toma o pulso à sociedade actual, a do digital, a do capitalismo, a da saúde mental frágil, a do consumismo desenfreado e do mercado de trabalho doentio. Nestezeitgeistque bem conhecemos, temos Marisa, de 32 anos, solteira, com um amigo colorido, que trabalha mais do que contrariada numa agência de publicidade há oito anos, que sofre de ataques de ansiedade e de choro mal o despertador toca de manhã e que tenta anestesiar-se com tranquilizantes.Sei que o mundo seria um lugar melhor se não existissem trabalhos como o meu. Sei que me aproveito das inseguranças das pessoas e da sua vontade de prosperar numa sociedade em que não se pode melhorar. E sei disso porque eu própria, depois de uma jornada de 8 horas e várias conversas de elevador que me provocaram uma série de ideações suicidas de baixa intensidade (…), acredito com frequência que a solução para todos os meus problemas está feita à minha medida num vestido florido da Zara fabricado no Bangladesh.Não espanta, portanto, que o seu mantra seja “Heaven knows I’m miserable now” dos Smiths.Morrissey cantava sobre a insatisfação que os trabalhos de merda provocam e a obrigação de pagar faturas, sobre a alienação que as horas no escritório causam e o pouco tempo para desfrutar dos verdadeiros prazeres da vida. À medida que fui crescendo, amadurecendo e trabalhando, a canção tinha em mim um efeito balsâmico e curativo, como quem ouve cantos gregorianos.Marisa odeia tanto a sua profissão que o ponto alto do seu dia é imaginar acidentes que poderia sofrer para ficar uma temporada de baixa ou mesmo incapacitada. É humor negro que escorre destas páginas, mas, como se costuma dizer, a brincar se dizem as verdades, e “O Desencanto” tem tanto de exasperante como de lúcido, até para os que “se julgam a ovelha mais esperta do rebanho”. Beatriz Serrano compôs uma personagem hilariantemente descompensada que vai ficar na minha galeria das preferidas pelo que diz, pelo que pensa e pelo que ouve e processa com um sarcasmo perfeito.Põem-me sempre a trabalhar nos projetos que incluem a palavra ‘empoderamento’ e perguntam-me se determinada frase de determinado anúncio pode ser ou não machista. Perguntam-me sempre se um tema poderia “incomodar as mulheres”, como se as conhecesse a todas. (…) Pensam que sou a sua Mary Wollstonecraft particular, sempre de serviço para lhes tirar as dúvidas.Quando a sanidade de Marisa já está presa por um fio e pensa que não há nada pior do que trabalhar com gente desmiolada e hipócrita, engolindo ansiolíticos como Smarties e trocando a terapia por visitas ao Museu do Prado, onde contempla o quadro de Hieronymus Bosch…Sinto que Bosch me entende, que tem dentro os mesmos demónios que eu tenho, mas ele é um génio da pintura e é capaz de expiá-los através dos seus dedos e do seu pincel, enquanto eu preciso de Lorsedais e de vídeos do YouTube.…recebe a notícia de uma iminente viagem deteam building, que se revelará a gota de água.A empresa como família. A ideia de que os nossos colegas de trabalho são algo mais do que colegas de trabalho para que nos custe horrores levantarmo-nos da nossa cadeira às 6 da tarde porque sentimos que estamos a abandonar o nosso irmão mais novo numa bomba de gasolina. Como não tenho filhos nem pais doentes e fui apanhada tão de surpresa que nem tive tempo de inventar uma doença rara, sou obrigada a ir.Quer tenham um emprego que odeiem ou adorem, quer tenham um emprego em que se sintam com um hamster na roda ou tenham liberdade de horário, este livro é para vocês… se tiverem uma ponta de cinismo que seja. Se não tiverem, sorte a vossa, a vida tem-vos tratado bem.Afinal, precisamos de poucas coisas na vida: alguém que nos ame, uma cama com grandes almofadões, umas latas de cerveja bem frescas e uns tomates que saibam a alguma coisa.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4\'5⭐ Es jodido lo terriblemente representada que me siento.""Lo que ni el médico de cabecera ni mi posterior terapeuta llegaron nunca a entender es que el estrés no me lo causaba mi trabajo,sino, tal y como le había dicho el hecho de tener que ir a trabajar [...] Todo ese tiempo regalado a otros en vez de estar en mi casa leyendo o dibujando o simplemente mirando el techo,semidesnuda, observando las grietas""'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'me gustó mucho este libro y me reí en voz alta leyéndolo! hice una reseñaaquí'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Esta novela trata sobre la depresión del siglo XXI, sobre la ansiedad y la soledad que casi todos hemos cargado en alguna ocasión a nuestras espaldas.

Primera novela de la autora que ha resultado finalista este año en el premio Planeta con su segunda novela, ""Fuego en la garganta"".A raíz del premio, oí hablar muy bien de su primer libro y al verlo disponible en Audible me lancé con él.Un libro corto en el que destaca su narrativa directa, irónica y afilada en voz de Marisa, su protagonista. Me ha encantado su humor ácido que te provocará más de una sonrisa pero también habrá en algún momento que te saque de quicio por las situaciones que vive y provoca.Entre medias, la autora va dejando frases a modo de reflexión que calan en el lector y en las que más de uno nos sentiremos identificados por la crudeza de la realidad con la que refleja el mundo laboral actual.El inicio del libro es brutal, cómo nos introduce en ese ambiente de oficina donde abundan las reuniones por videoconferencia en las que se respira hipocresía, la sátira con la que describe a los compañeros...y un final, como no podía ser de otra manera, a la altura del inicio... totalmente hilarante!!!En definitiva, un libro fresco provisto de un humor negro que seguro no deja indiferente a nadie y de ahí su éxito!!!!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '¡Marisa, ay Marisa!Vaya golazo de libro, vaya historia y vaya final.De verdad que he disfrutado muchísimo con la historia de Marisa, la he comprendido mucho más de lo que me hubiera gustado y he chillado con ese final del libro.Me parece una historia redonda, con una protagonista a la que le coges cariño desde el minuto 1 y con un trasfondo triste, pero con ese punto de humor que lo transforma completamente. Me ha encantado.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'No sé si ponerle 3 o 4 estrellas a esta novela corta, así que, “ni pa ti ni pa mí”Ciertamente es como en la realidad, es como si a alguien se le hubiese dado por escribir un diario sobre lo descontenta que se siente con la vida que lleva, o como la compilación de varias amigas juntas de cualquiera, en la que te cuentan como les va a cada una de ellas en la vida pero, en este caso, en una sola. La protagonista es una chica completamente insatisfecha de todo, su trabajo no le satisface en absoluto, no se sabe si es que es la vida la que no le gusta y por eso le molesta ir a trabajar, o que el hecho de ir a trabajar le hace estar mal con todo lo que le rodea en su vida, lo único que le aporta o le distrae de su propia existencia es ver videos de YouTube.He de decir que, desde que leí Wilt de Tom Sharpe hace tropecientos años, ninguna otra novela me había arrancado sonrisas y a veces carcajadas como lo ha hecho esta. Curiosamente, en sendas novelas tratan de dos personas insatisfechas, aunque cada una por motivos diferentes. Claro, que no quiere decir que eso que me ha hecho reír a mí, que soy de risa fácil porque me encantan las tonterías, hagan reír a los demás.No hace falta contar más sobre el argumento, porque en síntesis trata de eso, de la insatisfacción de una chica que tenía unas expectativas y acaba trabajando en una empresa de publicidad y lo que le causa ansiedad es que suene el despertador por la mañana para ir a trabajar. Me ha hecho gracia la utilización de tanto neologismo que hoy en día tanto se lleva; o esas frasecitas que están adjudicadas a algún tipo de persona, como cuando mi hijo me dice “esa es frase de madre”, pero no es porque lo sea, sino porque todas las madres lo decimos; como cuando la protagonista le llama a su vecino con palabros de esos que media humanidad todavía desconoce su significado y que definen a alguien en cierto tipo de colectivo; o cuando describe los sentimientos de cierto colectivo de su trabajo que nadie se atreve a verbalizar, pero que, en el fondo, todos sentimos. A veces resulta ser humor negro, pero que es real como la vida misma.Bueno, pues de esto es de lo que trata este librito, que me aventuré a leer porque me llamó la atención que Labi lo terminara con una sonrisa dibujada en su cara, y no le falta razón, aunque no sea para tanto, como dijo Esti. No sé, no ha estado mal.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Cuando leí esta novela me convencí de que Beatriz Serrano estaba narrando no solo la historia de Marisa, su protagonista, sino la de una generación entera atrapada entre expectativas laborales imposibles y un cansancio existencial que no se quita ni con todo el café del mundo. Desde la primera página, el humor ácido de Marisa me enganchó. Es sarcástica, mordaz, pero también vulnerable, y no pude evitar reírme, aunque fuera por no llorar, porque reconocí un poco de mi misma en su desencanto.Marisa, te lleva de paseo por su vida de treintañera atrapada en un trabajo que odia, lidiando con reuniones sin sentido, compañeros insoportables y anglicismos que dan ganas de gritar. Nos habla de la rutina moderna y del cansancio que da intentar cumplir con todas las expectativas: ser exitoso, feliz, productivo, y encima tener tiempo para fingir en redes que todo va genial. Y Marisa no lo está logrando (como muchos de nosotros). ¿La solución? Pastillas, YouTube y una buena dosis de autoironía.El episodio del “team building” funciona como un punto de quiebre en la historia. La máscara que Marisa ha construido para sobrevivir en el mundo laboral y social comienza a desmoronarse. Sus mecanismos habituales de escape resultan insuficientes. El evento la obliga a confrontar su propio malestar y las contradicciones de su vida cotidiana, revelando la fragilidad de la imagen que proyecta al exterior.Este punto medio de la novela prepara el terreno para el desenlace, donde la protagonista tendrá que decidir si puede y quiere romper con este ciclo de descontento.Lo mejor de esta novela es como se acerca a la realidad. Mientras lees, piensas: “Yo he estado ahí”, ya sea en una oficina absurda o en ese vacío existencial que viene cuando no tienes claro si estás viviendo la vida que querías. Pero también te ríes un montón, porque Beatriz Serrano tiene un talento especial para retratar lo absurdo de la vida moderna.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Una novela cortita y ágil de leer, amena, con un humor que hay que entenderlo, y que refleja la vida de muchísimas personas, muchas personas que odian IR a trabajar, no el hecho de trabajar en sí, pero si tener que ir, perder el tiempo en ir, tener que socializar demasiado hasta los días que menos ganas tengas…Quizá no es un librazo con una trama que te deje loco, con un final que podría haber sido diferente y con alguna cosilla que chirria, pero esta muy bien escrito, y me he sentido muy identificada con muchas cosas y como vive la protagonista el día a día.Es una critica a la situación laboral actual y de los modos de vida que adoptamos, aunque los critiquemos, porque todos criticamos muchos aspectos del trabajo pero siempre acabamos asumiendo que tiene que ser así.Creo que el mensaje que quiere dejar la autora es claro y es que no se necesita mucho para ser feliz, no hay que complicarse la vida y dar las gracias es esencial.Un libro corto para desconectar y de esos que casi seguro te podrás sentir identificado.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '4,5⭐️ Muy diferente a lo que he leído antes.

Marisa es directa y no se anda con rodeos, expone su realidad tal como es, sin adornos y manifestando su crítica hacia este sistema que nos deshumaniza y para el que sólo somos el medio con el que conseguir beneficios, pero un medio totalmente prescindible y fácilmente sustituible.Las reflexiones que contiene este libro me han parecido muy interesantes, y como la narración es tan fluida, natural y divertida, es muy fácil de leer. Creo que el análisis que hace del mundo laboral y las empresas es ingenioso y punzante, hay escenas muy graciosas y es fácil empatizar con su protagonista. Quizá lo que me ha fallado es que llega un momento en que se me ha hecho un poco repetitivo y la última parte que, quizá por querer provocar una situación de muchas risas, para mi gusto está demasiado exagerada. El final tampoco me convenció del todo, pero es algo subjetivo y de gusto personal, supongo que es lo que podíamos esperar de esta protagonista tan peculiar.Sea como sea ya os digo que es muy interesante y te hace reflexionar mientras te entretiene y te ríes un rato, es original y ameno, así que sí lo recomendaría.""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Bueno pedazo bajonazo de libro.Pintaba bien, la premisa me parecía empatizable y se vendía como una comedia.

Porque digo más que hacerme reír me deprimió.Marisa me ha resultado una protagonista insoportable, que tiene todos los ingredientes para que empatice, e igual marisa soy yo? Pues espero que no. Pero si es así normal que me tenga tanto asco. Porque madre de dios Marisa es la clase de persona insulsa que no hace más que puto quejarse de absolutamente todo, literalmente la única persona de la que no se queja es de una compañera suya que se suicidó.

Se conoce aparentemente bien, pero hace todo lo posible por cambiar su situación?Tal como nos cuenta ella misma, necesita realizar algo para emborracharse con la adrenalina que desata tu cuerpo cuando haces algo por primera vez, algo un poco complicado cuado aparentemente lo tienes todo y te falta motivación...Al leer la novela, la lectura para mí es clara y es mi conclusión:Evidentemente la felicidad plena es una clara utopía, que aunque nos invadan con ideas de la misma, sabemos que no existe, lo que si existen son momentos de felicidad, pero....Estamos preparados para sentarnos y realizar un ejercicio de introspección, de parar y ponernos a pensar lo que necesitamos de verdad? Estamos preparados para escuchar a nuestros fantasmas y aceptar, asumir e incluso en el mejor de los casos, cambiar las cosas?Debemos asumir que la ambición desmedida no es comparable con la búsqueda de la felicidad en las pequeñas cosas?

Pensaba encontrarme una crítica al mundo laboral y corporativo desde un punto de vista más humorístico, pero, aunque es cierto que algunas frases te arrancan una sonrisa, en general es más una visión cínica de las relaciones laborales en particular y de las relaciones sociales en general. En la última parte del libro, casi un epílogo, he apreciado un cambio de tercio notable, y todo acaba, curiosamente pese a las circunstancias, con un tono mucho más afable. En general me ha gustado, es un libro entretenido que se lee rápido (es bastante cortito), y quizá parte de la culpa de mi ligera decepción hayan sido mis distintas expectativas al respecto.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'El descontento, el mío al leer este libro, ains.

Para mí naufraga en el cinismo de la protagonista, la banalización de temas que en absoluto lo son, y el conformismo total con un mundo de mierda al que por qué no sumarle toda la mierda que puedas desde tus pequeñas cotas de poder.

Un libro que se lee rápido y con el que es fácil sentirte identificada.Así que si os apetece pasar un buen rato, reíros y no sentiros solas en ese mar de ansiedad, estrés y angustia que provoca el trabajo por un rato: este es vuestro libro.Pd: abajo el trabajo!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Para los que hemos trabajado en empresas parecidas a las que se relatan en esta historia, esto ha sido como un golpe en la boca del estómago.Pero he de decir que ha sido un golpe gracioso, de estos golpes que si ves en tercera persona te ríes.

Sobre como acaban separándose las relaciones de amistad, convirtiéndose en amigos de tus compañeros de trabajo (porque no te queda otra) o de algún que otro follamigo.

This book is a piece of heaven that was sent from above, this book is the perfection incarnate, this book is nothing short of magical, this book easily makes my top five books of all-time list, and this book is without a doubt the best book I’ve read in 2017. I’m not sure how I’m even going to attempt to come up with a review fitting for this masterpiece, but I’m going to try.Okay, maybe I should start this review off with a personal story. You know, full disclosure and all that. I was a young girl, at the mall with my mom, and we walked into a Borders Outlet. I’ve always been a rather ravenous reader, but at that time in my reading life I was reading only crime thrillers. Think things like James Patterson and John Grisham. Well, while I was perusing the new releases on this autumn day back in the 2007, a worker came up to me and started talking to me about her love for books, but more importantly her love for fae books. She was so kind and warm and enthusiastic, I couldn’t help but ask her to pick me one of her favorite fae stories. Well, she ended up handing me two, but one of them wasTitheby Holly Black, and this godsend Borders Outlet employee completely changed me and my reading life forever.After that day, and after I inhale read that book, Holly Black became one of my favorite authors and my parents couldn’t keep unread fae fantasy books on my shelves. And ten years later, I’ve never looked back. I’ve been completely obsessed with fae stories ever since. And if I ever develop magical powers, one of the first thing I’m going to do is track down that Borders Outlet employee and thank her for making me the reader that I am today.Okay, sappy and heartwarming story aside, this book was honestly perfection in every aspect. You want fae courts? Bloodthirsty fae royals fighting for a crown? Twists after twists and reveals after reveals? Heartwarming scenes followed by heart wrenching scenes? The slowest and most agonizing but also the most romantic and powerful and rewarding hate to love romance in the world? Pick this book up.“Because you’re like a story that hasn’t happened yet. Because I want to see what you will do. I want to be part of the unfolding of the tale.”And the writing? I mean, not only is Holly Black the literal queen of all things fae, she is also the queen at stringing together words that make me feel everything in the entire universe. The amount of sticky notes and highlights I have in this book is ridiculous, but Holly Black’s writing is so poignant and lyrical and honestly the most perfect thing my eyes have ever seen. This entire book reads like one giant tragic ballad, yet it is equal parts heartbreak and hope. This book is so haunting, so dark, and so twisted.“But I will not stand in front of your happiness. I will not even stand in front of misery that you choose for yourself.”Jude is a very young girl when she witnesses her parents murder. After that terrible night, she and her sisters are whisked away by the murderer to live in Faerie. Now, ten years later, Jude is trying to live among the fae, while constantly being reminded of her mortal human status. Yet, she soon gets wrapped up in a very elaborate game, from many different sides, which will cause a civil war to break out in the Courts of Faerie if the game isn’t played properly.The High King has ruled for centuries, but people feel like it is finally time for him to step down and give the royal crown to one of his children. In this world, the king chooses his successor; it doesn’t automatically go to the oldest child. And the High King has six children in line waiting for him to make his choice.Prince Cardan is the youngest son of the High King. He is wicked, and charming, and smart, and maybe even a little cruel. Oh, and he makes Jude’s life a living hell most of the time. He’s also one of the best characters I’ve ever read in my entire life.And with Cardan, comes his group of friends: Nicasia who likes power, Valerian who likes violence, and Locke who likes dramatics, but they all love tormenting Jude in very different ways.“That’s what comes of hungering for something; you forget to check if it’s rotten before you gobble it down”Even though Jude is the only point of view, and is the main protagonist of this amazing story, her two sisters play a huge part of this story, too. Taryn is Jude’s twin, who must watch all the torment that Jude endures, and Vivi is their older sister and one of the best side characters I’ve ever read. She’s unique and defiant and strong and devoted, and her romance with her girlfriend meant everything to me. Also, Vivi is on the page bisexual and that representation meant even more than everything to me.Oh, and speaking of adorable queer relationships; Ben and Severin, fromThe Darkest Part of the Forest, make a cameo in this and I was crying the happiest tears! I don’t think I will ever be over THAT whisper, and I’ve just completely accepted that. Be still, my heart.But Jude is our main character of this story, and you can tell from everything that I’ve written above that she doesn’t have the easiest of lives. See, the fae in this world are very dependent on humans, even though they remind them of their lower status constantly, because the fae women have a very hard and sporadic time conceiving and bearing children, therefore, they rely on humans reproducing for them. Well, Jude doesn’t want that life, she wants to make a name for herself and be one of the greatest knights that the Courts of Faerie have ever seen!Jude is strong willed and very determined, but she is also one of the most selfless characters I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading from. She is a very morally grey character, yet she will completely capture your heart. But she’s young and learning that love comes in very different forms, and sometimes we are unable to control what we feel.“I stand in front of my window and imagine myself a fearless knight, imagine myself a witch who hid her heart in her finger and then chopped her finger off.”One of the most beautiful things about this book is that none of these characters are perfect. Jude, Cardan, all of them do bad things, and none of them are ever excused of their crimes, but they learn to deal with them and the other ramifications that come from their actions. I mean, none of us are perfect people, and we all make bad choices at times. But this book accepts that and reflects that, but also highlights the importance of growing, and becoming a stronger person, and picking what battles you choose to fight. It’s a truly beautiful message and I really appreciated having a full cast of nonperfect characters that do nonperfect things.“But we all want stupid things. That doesn’t mean we should have them.”Also, this is a spoiler free review, but I just have toyell from the rooftopssay that Chapter 26 is the best chapter I’ve read in all of literature. I will fight anyone that says otherwise. Chapter 26 tortured me, broke up, killed me, rebirthed me, and gave me new life. The end of Chapter 25 through Chapter 26 was the most romantic scene my eyes have ever witnessed. I feel so blessed to have even been able to read those glorious paragraphs. Like, I’m a different person after experiencing Chapter 26. When I’m sad or hurt or angry, I’m going to reread Chapter 26 so I know the true meaning of this life.“…like taking a dare to run over knives, like an adrenaline strike of lighting, like the moment when you’ve swum too far out in the sea and there is no going back, only cold black water closing over your head.”Also, fair warning, this book has a cliffhanger ending that puts all other cliffhanger endings to shame. Just typing that sentence gave me full body goosebumps, by the way! Oh, and the title of this book is absolute perfection, as well.This book has touched me in a way that very few books have in my life. This is the type of book that reminds me why I fell in love with reading in the first place. This is the type of book that makes me believe words have the most powerful healing magic of anything in this world. This is the type of book that completely sets my soul on fire and makes me feel utterly enchanted. I just know thatThe Cruel Princeis a once in a lifetime series, because this first installment was everything I have ever wanted in a book.Holly Black immerses me, captivates me, and makes me believe in magic. I have no words of gratitude for that, and I’m not sure what the world has done to deserve her stories, but I will forever be grateful. Holly Black helps me forget all the actual cruel princes in our world today, and their terrible choices that they are making for all of us. And honestly, I’d be super surprised if she isn’t an actual fae queen, that just escaped faerie to torture us with real stories that went on while she was ruling.Again, if you can only preorder one book for the rest of the year, please pickThe Cruel Princeby Holly Black. It’s not only my favorite book of the year, it’s one of my favorite books of all time. And then read the rest of Holly Black’s work, because her books are truly the closest thing to magic and each is a tangible vessel of joy that I have an an unconditional amount of love for.“If I cannot be better than them, I will be so much worse.”Blog|Twitter|Tumblr|Instagram|Youtube|TwitchContent warningsfor bullying, talk of suicide, and abuse.The quotes above were taken from an ARC and are subject to change upon publication.(Thank you so much,Diana.

And rereading this was truly the best holiday gift I could have ever given myself. ❤""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '4.5/5 ⭐Full review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolf🐺“(…) cheekbones sharp enough to cut out a girl’s heart.”I love me a cruel and tipsy Faerie prince and that’s Cardan and only Cardan.I mean everything I said in the previous sentence. Every. Word. Is. True.Cardan was the best thing happening to this book and if you deny this that that’s strictly your problem. He’s a charmer.*I don’t read hyper-hyped books in general. But when I do, I read them aeons after they’re out so the hype has worn out and I can enjoy the book (or not) in peace. This one was super hyped. I was plainly curious to see if it really is worth a shot.I truly didn’t expect the beginning of the book toscreamlike that. That was a power move. And I liked it.Everything that came after that was to lure us into the Faerie world, of what, I must admit, I have only a minimum knowledge of. Everyone is beautiful, but everyone is cruel. Basically, it looks like a circus.It is important for me to be able to grasp the world from the beginning. I feel frustrated when the whole universe unravels as if I just dropped in the middle of what was going on and no one had the time to acknowledge me.I want to feel important from the beginning.Thank you, Holly Black, I did feel important!“Being born mortal is like being born already dead.”This is the story of sisters. Vivienne, Jude and Taryn are three sisters who began their lives in the mortal world and but then were forced to come to Elfhame after their parents got brutally murdered by their soon-to-be foster father – Vivienne’s real father. Vivi is one of them; Jude and Taryn, the twins, are not. This is the story of the sisters’ struggle to be accepted in a world that doesn’t want them to be part of.Although Jude and Taryn are twins, they are completely different from each other. Where Taryn is ladylike and delicate, silent and obedient, Jude is determined and loud and wild. Where Taryn wants to be granted a place in the Faerie world through marriage, Jude wants to be a knight and play at war.The story is narrated from Jude’s point of view. That is probably why many people find her annoying. The whole story sounds like her own roaring thoughts and feelings. Maybe she annoys herself too as many of us get annoyed with ourselves and our own thoughts.“You’re like a story that hasn’t happened yet.”In a purely honest note, I kind of liked Jude in this book. Sure, she was a bit annoying sometimes, but truth be said, I liked her better than Taryn. There was something about her twin sister that made me repel her. Jude was interesting in a way that made me relate to her. I could totally see me sometimes in her actions. I felt like she was full of her own personality.She’s power-thirsty. But this is how she was raised to be. To fight, to scheme, to seek and seize power. She’s the foster daughter of the great general of the Faerie after all. I still consider that a badass trait about her. Don’t you think?Now, as I previously stated, I think I might have a soft spot for Cardan, the youngest Prince of the Faerie.“There’s safety in being awful.”Cardan Greenbriar might seem cruel, reckless, thirsty for violence, but I think he is totally the good boy in disguise type. I mean, at first, I couldn’t stand him (even though I hated his friends more than I despised him). Then, there was this period of transition where I had mixed feelings about him. 65% in and I just slowly but steadily started to fall in love with him. I started to realise things about him as presented by his actual, intimate actions. And how couldn’t I fall like a fool? He was a lonely and broken boy. All he wanted was to love and be loved, but no one seemed to care about him enough to grant him that little. What is the whole power in the world of Faerie without an ounce of affection to it?“Most of all, I hate you because I think of you. Often. It’s disgusting and I can’t stop.”He hates. Hates because he loves. Hate because he’s not loved.His relationship with Jude starts and unfolds slowly. They have that wonderful love-to-hate relationship that I actually enjoy in books in general.I consider their relationship a bit unhealthy though. What happens between the two of them is a peculiar kind of hate-love. It’s a game played out of spite. It’s all about power and desire. I am not sure this is right, but I do believe that this type of relationship is going to improve because from hate to love to hate to love again – that’s an endless wheel that could be stopped anytime, anywhere. One can make a beautiful thing out of something hideous, but one can also ruin the beauty of a thing. Their relationship, in this book, is dangerous ground.Indeed, something about the book seemed off. Even though the world-building was very good and the action was fantastic, the depth of the characters was somehow missing. I wanted them to be more individualised, but I think that’s just because we see the story through only one character’s point of view. When you personalise the action, it’s hard to create well-developed individuals.That, I think, it’s the only contradictory thing I have to say about this book. Really. I even enjoyed all the bloodshed there. And that’s not okay. But it was so cleverly crafted that I justhad toenjoy it somehow??____________________________________________Also see:#2.The Wicked King(⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)#3.The Queen of Nothing(⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '*clears throat*Excuse me, uh. Who cares?This is not a rhetorical question. I truly want to know. I read this whole ass book and I am still at a complete loss for something, anything, to care about. Not a plot point, not a character trait, not a single line of quirky banter I could get myself emotionally invested in.https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...This is a book about fairies and it was a trial for me to get through. Me, a person who loves fairies so much she spent her entire third grade year absolutely convinced, in a non-ironic manner, that she was one.It doesn’t get much more dream audience for this book than me. And I couldn’t give two sh*ts, or one sh*t, or even a fraction of a sh*t, for so much as a moment. So. Who among you was able to pull off such a feat?Okay, to be fair, maybe I’m not the dream audience. Holly Black and I have a rocky past. I grew up on the Spiderwick books (well, mostly the Field Guide, which I used as a means of learning about my own species. See the above “I thought I was a fairy” admission). ButThe Coldest Girl in Coldtownis one of 9 books I’ve DNFed in my entire goddamn life, andThe Darkest Part of the Forestwas another snoozefest.Ilikecharacter-driven stories. I like slow books with beautiful writing. But I don’t like Holly Black characters, and I don’t love Holly Black’s writing, and basically all of her books put me to sleep every time. And also make me feel like I’m reading the exact same book over and over. Seriously, they all read the same. Including Spiderwick, which is shocking because that 1) is middle grade and 2) has a good deal less sexual tension than a lot of her other stuff.Anyway.This book was so, so boring.Nothing really happens until past the 200-page mark, and by then everything is so silly and ridiculous that I was mostly along for the ride. What, you say? More of the synopsis is out the window? We’re just deleting more character development from our brains? Delightful.Because, again, who cares.I know a lot of people love this book because they love Jude. I don’t know why they love Jude. Is she supposedly “strong” or “powerful” or “badass” or one of those words we assign to characters when there isn’t much to describe? Because I’m not seeing anything to fall in love with.I know a lot of people love this book because they love Cardan. I know exactly why they love Cardan. It is because he is one of three or four YA boy character archetypes that draw in blatant adoration (and delightful fan art) from readers WITHOUT. FAIL.Basically, here are the acceptable YA male traits. You pick a combination of these, and you have your flat, uninteresting, repeat character.- handsome OR beautiful OR hot- funny OR mysterious OR charming- banter-y OR bully-y OR flirtyAnd that’s it. I often like the handsome/funny/banter-y archetype. From time to time, I’ll enjoy a hot/charming/flirty one.I always, always, always hate the beautiful/mysterious/bully-y one. I hated Will Herondale, and boy oh boy do I hate Cardan.And I know a lot of people love this book because of the plot and the world. But the plot to me was nonexistent, because for 200 pages this book largely made me drag myself through it, with no action or momentum to pull me along. And the world is just Every Holly Black Book But With A Slight Twist, Maybe. And that world hasn’t worked for me since I was nine and thought myself a resident, my dear boy.Bottom line: I guess the thing with Holly Black is that if one book works for you, they all will. But baby, that goes both ways!---------------pre-reviewthis book is...lame.review to come!!!---------------currently-reading updatesbuddy reading this withlilyandmayand we are definitely all thriving and having a good time. no rage or boredom involved at all---------------tbr reviewjust received official word that i WILL be excommunicated from goodreads if i do not have this book on my shelves'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Jan 2023:Still impossible to put down and I know what happens!! Gotta say, I\'m glad I didn\'t reread this before readingThe Stolen Heirbecause that one would have paled in comparison. Nothing quite like Jude & Cardan.No matter how careful I am, eventually I\'ll make another misstep. I am weak. I am fragile. I am mortal.I hate that most of all.Over the course of this year, I\'ve read both books that I\'ve liked and books I\'ve disliked. I\'ve read books that I\'ve loved and, it\'s fair to say, books that are better written, more unique, and more groundbreaking than this book. That being said, however, I am struggling to recall a book that has left me this excited about a YA series in a very long time.It seems like forever since I read a completely juicy YA fantasy with just the right amount ofdrama, action, surprises, nastiness and the tiniest hints at romantic possibility. The wait for the next book is going to be torture!Holly Black knows her audience so well. She\'s not kind to us because she knows we don\'t really want that anyway. So of courseThe Cruel Princeopens with a brutal murder that leaves Jude, her twin sister Taryn, and their older sister Vivienne at the mercy of the redcap general - Madoc. Jump to ten years later, and the three sisters are all living in Faerie. They\'ve been raised as Madoc\'s own, more or less, and each is trying to find her own place among the beautiful but cruel, deceitful but always honest, fey.For Vivi, return to the human world is the answer. For Taryn, assimilation and playing by the rules is the only way. For our narrator - Jude - rebellion, bloodshed and winning her place in the King\'s council is what she desires.Nicasia\'s wrong about me. I do not desire to do as well in the tournament as one of the fey. I want to win. I do not yearn to be their equal.In my heart, I yearn to best them.It is extremely compelling. Even before the real drama kicks off in the later chapters, I was so wholly pulled into Jude\'s world. The bullying she endures at the hands of her fey classmates adds a heavy dose of unfairness to keep you pissed enough to turn the pages. Then we get to the spying, secrets, betrayals, side-switching and, oh wow, can I just have the next book please?In truth, not a single character is entirely likeable. All are complex, more than a little flawed, and nobody can be trusted. Even Jude. It\'s really quite wonderful. Cardan, the ""cruel prince"" from the title, is an asshole. A drunken, bullying, selfish asshole. And yet... and yet. We shall see.In case it wasn\'t obvious,I loved it. All the drama is absolutely delicious and, while Black does draw on some familiar tropes, the world, characters and politics feel fresh in her hands. It charges to a climax full of surprises and the ending doesn\'t disappoint. Nicely wrapped up but with enough to leave me desperate for the next instalment.

The buzz it ignites is amazing. They create this excitement within you that has your mind wandering to all of the possibilities and direction the book can go in.Because of the hype, I assumed I would enjoy this book. I'm quite an easy-to-please reader, so usually when a book is hyped up, I tend to enjoy it. Or even if I don't, I will feel indifferent. But this book brought about a rage within me; I hated it with every fibre of my being.You may be thinking that because of the fact I 'succumbed' to the hype, it ruined the experience for me. That was not the case at all. I always go in weary, but with a sense of optimism when it comes to hyped books.As for the book, well, everything was wrong with it for me. Other than the slight addictive quality it had - which died for me after I passed the halfway point - this book was weak in every sense of the word. From the protagonist, to the characters, the plot and the world building. There was no development or growth that brought those aspects to live, not even the writing.The story-line started off quite tragic, with Jude's parents being brutally killed off from the bat. From that, I was expecting some kind of revenge story, or emotionally harrowing character development, because to witness that when you're young will obviously take a toll.But no. That wasn't explored. Right off the bat, our main character goes on to enter some kind of tournament she has no experience in whatsoever. There's nothing ingrained within her to take on this challenge, no power she embodies, intellectually or physically. Whilst it took place, all I kept thinking about was how flimsy the battle was, neither did it feel complete. Just rushed.Thus this was the narrative the story carried on. Our main character had no proper background that we as readers were exposed to in order for us to connect with, no experience, and neither had she trained to gain any of it throughout the course of the book. Everything was just thrown (characters and world) at the reader, and felt as if we were expected to go with the flow and further clarification was not given or explained. Event after event took place with no sense of proper progression of the overall plot. No aspect to it whatsoever felt substantial or concrete.I got angrier as I read on and when it got to the last 50 odd pages, I refused to carry on, because I couldn't bring myself to care one bit. It wasn't that it was even mediocre; the whole book felt pointless to me.INITIAL REACTION REVIEW:Well, I'm pretty sure my soul just died. No, it is dead.I haven't hated a book this much since Caraval and I don't tend to hate books that often. I'm indifferent most of the time, and I do enjoy a lot of the ones I read. But this... god. I have no words.Review to come when I can feel again.Ugh.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I do not yearn to be their equal. In my heart, I yearn to best them.Wow, what a start to the trilogy! I'm not sure what I expected going intoThe Cruel Prince, but it certainly wasn't this much fun or this much nastiness.Jude was only seven years old when her parents were brutally murdered in front of her eyes. The man who killed them took her and her sisters to the High Court of Faerie, to be brought up as one of them. Yet, in the ten years since, Jude has never felt like she belonged. As a mortal, she is always less than in the eyes of the Faeries. In particular, she makes an enemy of the cruel Prince Cardan. When treachery comes to the High Court, Jude must figure out what she's really capable of in order to grab the power she so desires.Right off the bat, it's clear that every character in here is somewhat morally corrupt, including our heroine Jude. To survive and thrive, they must continually scheme and do bad things. While I don't normally gravitate towards this sort of story, it works here because everyone's motivations make sense. I feel an emotional connection with each character, so I'm able to cheer them on, even as their actions become crazier and more questionable. It sure makes for an entertaining read, one I can't look away from.The writing is truly top-notch, with a sharpness that keeps me on my toes. I particularly enjoyed the dialogue, which is so witty and scathing that it feels like every line is worth savoring and rereading. The worldbuilding is easy and effortless, drawing the reader seamless into this universe. It proceeds bit by bit, so there's never any confusion or info dumping. And the way every tidbit eventually fits together is satisfying to the extreme.There's so much packed into this one story: politics, family drama, revenge, power, and murder. There's even a bit of romantic intrigue disguised as mutual hate, which is quite delicious. Everything builds up slowly, increasing in tension until we reach a turning point about halfway through. After that, the gloves are off, and we are treated to one surprise after another. I never knew what the next chapter would bring, so I was turning the pages as fast as I could.When I think of a fantasy story I want to sink my teeth into, I'm looking for a few things: sharp writing, well-plotted story, compelling characters, and seamless worldbuilding. And if there's a dash of romance, I certainly wouldn't object. Well, this book has them all, and I'm in awe over how flawlessly everything came together.

I don\'t get the hype and I hate how relationships are portrayed in the story! Authors and reviewers here on Goodreads that Itrustedtrust raved about this book .... and I\'m here lighting the fire so I can burn the pages.....First of all... the writing is horrendous. It\'s the worst case of ""tell, not show"" I\'ve ever seen (Twilight was better written than this): ""I did this, she did that, now I\'m gonna do this ..."". There was no emotion in the writing, I did not feel any attachment toward the world of ""Faerieland"" and I couldn\'t connect with the protagonist, Jude,because I wanted to slap some sense into her the entire time: she acts recklessly, even when other peoplewarn her repeatedly not to do the thingand for the first 200 pages shedoes nothing but complain, indulging in a self-pity party like there is no tomorrow.My heart bleeds0_0.Continuing - the other characters are 2D, the plot is non-existent for the first 200+ pages and the grand finale/epilogue everyone\'s been raving about....left me colder than a dead body dropped in Siberia.I could not care less.An issue that had me concerned while reading this: the character who is heavily hinted as being the love interest:almost every scene in which he makes an appearance showcases how abusive he is, especially towards the MC and no one (from the reviews I have read) flags this as a major problem?. I have little patience for female (and male, for that matter) authors who write abusive love interests and thenabsolve them of all the nasty acts they have perpetrated. In the world of endemic sexual harassment and abusive behaviour, in the world of #metoo and the horrifying stories of women being treated like less than dirt,why do we fall for this type of characters? Why do we keep buying these books? And why do we praise the authors who write them???????.I\'ve wasted enough electricity writing a review for a book that will surely be my worst read of the year.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Absolutely loved this read!! A wondrous fantasy novel that is easy to get invested in. So many great plot twists and high-intensity, suspenseful moments!TW: murder, physical abuse, sexual abuse, suicideHolly Black is truly the queen of creating exquisite worlds. Her interpretation of faeries is always so fascinating and glorious. It’s hard to fully capture what it is about her world-building that is so magical, but her books are always my favorite when it comes to faeries. I believe a part of it is that she flawlessly captures the danger and darkness of fey while also displaying the beauty of their magic. There are few words to accurately describe her talent for writing intriguing and beautiful fantasy worlds.I really enjoyed the characters in this story. Jude is a great protagonist – her fierceness is complimented by her vulnerability, which makes her very realistic considering her circumstances. The relationships between characters are also fascinating, especially the family dynamics. The way Jude views her sisters and “adoptive” family are very unique in my opinion.I also enjoyed the fact that this is not a romance novel. Though it is weaved in here and there, I feel the overarching plot becomes full of politics as the story progress. I will admit, I did lose focus at sometimes while listening to the audiobook because so much of this novel is centered on political relationships, the complications of monarchies, dynamics between different courts, and plotting to overthrow. That being said, it is so well developed and different from many YA books that I overall had a great experience with in.In total, The Cruel Prince was fantastic.

YES! how can a book that is short and straight forward in writing pack such a big punch. this is no SJM, overly complicated and long bullshit. holly black writes with intention.- the family... the theme of family in this was amazing. jude's relationship with madoc and her sisters was so realistic and nuanced that i felt like it could have existed in real life. i loved it.- the world... somehow it slipped past me in the description of this book but this is set in present day. there are malls and mcdonalds in the human world. how fucking cool is that??? super cool juxtaposition with the seemingly antiquated fae world.- jude... sweetie. you are awesome. you are a bad ass. your feelings are so fcking valid. also the way her feelings about cardan are described in this book... perfection. i seriously related to her which is rare. why are females in books so damn annoying usually? idk but jude IS NOT.- CARDAN... i mean do i really have to explain this one? he's perfect.

I mean, seriously. Jude is a *glorious* lead: a shrewd and determined survivor with exactly the kind of cunning that I love. YES. And then there are her sisters! Cardan! The princes of Faerie!

It is the hate that binds us.Edit: I made a badge with MS Paint. >:DWhat would happen if you combinedHana Yori Dangowith Game of Thrones? This book.I\'m kind of surprised at how much I enjoyed THE CRUEL PRINCE. It was receiving a lot of hype, and normally that turns me off, because so much of the hype surrounding books these days seemssomanufactured. I\'m really sick of seeing everyone post aesthetic pictures of certain books and say, ""OMG! THIS IS SO GREAT! LIFE CHANGING! WOW!"" and then I go, ""Oh really?"" and pick it up, like a sucker, and find out that the book is not greatorlife-changing but incredibly mediocre or, worse, bad and just basically more of the same.THE CRUEL PRINCE is that 1book out of 100 that deserves all the hype. Faeries are portrayed as they\'resupposedto be: not Greek gods with convenient magical powers that spend all their time acting like life is one big fat reality TV show, but actual scary, power-hungry creatures who are terrifying as they are beautiful to behold. Jude and her sisters, Taryn and Vivi, find that out the hard way when one of them bursts into their door in the mortal world andmurders both her parents. It turns out that their mother was previously married - to a fae - and he didn\'t take kindly to cheating.But leaving behind orphans leaves a sour taste in Madoc (jealous faerie ex-husband)\'s mouth so he brings back all three of them to be reared in the world of faerie, where they\'re treated in his household like minor Gentry and resented by pretty much everyone else. Including the Elite 4 - *cough* - I mean the Faerie ""Plastics"": Nicasia, Locke, Valerian, and Cardan. Jude, not knowing when to stand down or keep her mouth shut, ends up bearing the brunt of their humiliations and intimidation tactics, and instead of learning a lesson, she ends up feeling nothing but rage and a desire for revenge.For about 1/3 of this book, it felt like another YA fantasy drama with a mortal girl who ends up biting off more than she can chew with a side-romance that feels tepid. Then about 2/3 in, things start to get really crazy, with court intrigue, espionage, betrayal, murder, poison, and yes, okay, illicit romance. The last 100 pages of this book got even better, and the last fifty had me going ""OMG!!!!"" I received an electronic copy of this book for review, but rest assured, had I been holding a physical copy, I would have been white-knuckling it in a death grip even the most dedicated wrestler would admire.I think this book\'s biggest failing is actually the genre. It\'s forced to dial down the cruelty, the sexuality, and the violence, so sometimes the tone feels a little off. THE HUNGER GAMES, as much as I loved it, had the same problem. YA is still very puritanical, with good reason, butsometimes when authors try to push the envelope within the confines of the parameters set by the age group they\'re writing for, certain topics can feel either unexplored or disconcertingly tame.I almost feel like this would have been better written for an adult audience, with older characters.That small qualm aside, I really enjoyed THE CRUEL PRINCE. I enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed THE HUNGER GAMES and VAMPIRE ACADEMY. I loved that Jude started off selfish and kind of petulant, and gradually learned to hone her cruelty and her callousness into a very successful weapon. I like it when heroines are powerful and dangerous and morally grey, and given roles typically given to male characters in the genre. I also loved the dark prince, Cardan. He and Jude have a real ""Reylo"" dynamic, and I foresee a ""Fifty Shades of Fae"" sequel somewhere down the line for them. #YaassP.S. Still not sure if I mentioned THAT I HATE TARYN A LOT? :D :DP.P.S. Not sure if I understand all the need for subterfuge in the court. Everyone made a big deal of how faeries can\'t lie, so why not just line everyone up and say ""Are you scheming against me or participating in schemes against me, either directly or indirectly?"" and then kill anyone who says ""yes"" or refuses to answer? Why go through all the rigamarole of involving extra spies? See, I\'m a mortal and I\'d make a better faerie ruler than half these losers. #ACourtOfSmutAndCommonSenseThanks to Netgalley/the publisher for the review copy!5 stars'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Cardan Greenbriar holds my heart in his hands, and he looks rather smug about it, theabsolutely perfectinsufferable jerk.This is one of those books where the faerie are actually scary. Yes, they're pretty immature, but they're cruel, terrible people who play with mortals for fun. These are not your Sarah J. Maas fae. They can't control the wind or change shapes -- but they can force humans to do their will, which is almost worse. Unless you wrap a string of rowan berries around your neck or turn your stockings inside-out.Jude and Cardan are characters that make the plot seem like a side thing. I could watch them fold laundry and be perfectly content. Their dynamic is the best thing I've seen since Rowaelin. I noticed farther along that Jude and Cardan are literally just genderswapped versions of each other. She pretends like Cardan is the worst person ever, but just compare them, and you'll see what I mean. They both crave power over others. They both deceive each other without a second thought. It's the perfect love-hate relationship.And that's why I don't think it's problematic. I've seen reviews criticizing Jurdan, but they both tormented each other. Jude ultimately betrayed Cardan in the end. This is one of those relationships where they'll either get married or kill each other. (Please don't kill each other. I love you both too much.)I would welcome Cardan to the part of my heart specifically set aside for cinnamon rolls, but he would probably burn the whole thing down while muttering something about decomposing mortals. Sam Cortland could never.I'm just going to stand here in awe while all of you actually do productive things. I didn't see any of those twists coming. I know I probably should have. But I didn't. And while some may say the plot was too convenient, or too basic, or too convoluted--I was never bored. Not once. Do you have any idea how long it's been since I've been this invested in a novel? Too long, my friends.There is just one thing I would have liked to see more of inThe Cruel Prince,and that's worldbuilding. I still have no idea what a Seelie Court and an Unseelie Court are, and I suppose I could look it up, but I would have preferred an explanation in the book. Maybe I'll get one inThe Wicked King.Even though the atmosphere in Elfhame was just perfect, I wanted to know more about the world outside that of the faerie, and how it all connected to the human world. But that's not enough to take off more than a star, because Cardan and Jude have stolen my heart, and I'm pressing charges.Buddy read withmy fellow Jude stan.

would currently be this bookmaybe i overhyped myself too muchbut this was such a bloody disappointmentit’s kind of like when you see someone with so much potential ruining their livesand wonder why they would do thatwhen they could be so much more?yeah, that’s one of the many feelings i’m going through right nowmostly annoyance and irritationi can’t lie during some points in this bookmostly alli’ve wanted to gouge my eyes outbecause of the sheer stupiditythat i mentally had to adhere toi’m going to start with the first jackassakaJude the JackassJude the Jackass has only a few things she’s capable ofnow you’re wonderingthat she’s probably something amazinggiven her new name and allbut nothis dummy is one of the most infuriating mains i’ve had to endure with for a while.i actually want to be a super genius right nowso i can build a time machineand tell my past self not to read this bookbecause it’s not worth all the negative emotions you’ll go throughoh, and yeah you’ll hate all the charactersi mean what’s the point if you hate everyone?okay, back to what Jude the Jackass is capable of, all she’s capable of is whining, being annoying, stupidity, and lest we forget, being useless.hah, i bet you thought she was something elsebut no, i hate to be the bearer of bad newsbut that’s all she’s made up of.i considered jumping inside the book multiple times just to smack some sense into her.k let’s start with how Jude loves the man who killed her parentsbut there’s a line that she doesn’t crossbecause he still killed her parentsso she can’t love him too muchbut she does love himcause he took them in and raised themand he’s like a father to herand it’s absolutely normal to lovethe man who killed both ofyour parents in front of your eyes.do you see my dilemma?already just by knowing thati wanted to eat 4 packets of those super spicy noodles that everyone does as a challengejust so i can punish myselffor reading as far along as that.Jude is very repetitiveshe keeps reminding methat she still loves Madocseveral times during the bookand here i am wonderingwhat got me to this pointwhere i’m reading some bullshit like this.Jude always protects her vile sister Tarynnot knowing that her twin actually doesn’t like Judeand thinks she’s so annoying and what not.if i had a twin i’d know if she didn’t like me.and what makes me even more irritatedis that Jude thinks her sister is helplessand that she has to protect her.bitch, you need to protect yourself from Tarynshe doesn’t like youcan’t you get that through those signalsshe’s sending youthen again since she’s powerlessas she so kindly reminds meshe probably can’t even understand the basic signs of when someone doesn’t like youughi didn’t understand Jude and what’s his name?Cardigan?Cardyn?must be something like thatbut yeah the few times that he’s in the bookit’s mostly as a bullythen he’s mia for a huge portionthen all of a sudden we get so much of him in the endthat it was just awkwardthere was no builduphe just has an important part during the endand yeah, he’s not an asshole because that’s just the way he is, he’s that way due to “circumstances”*cue major eye roll*Jude hates this guy, then has an opportunityto finally get the revenge she’s always wantedbut she’s a softy for him nowjust because his brother beat himand he’s got daddy issuesand he had reasons for the awful wayhe treated herso that must make him a good faebecause all good fae try to drown youdemean you, humiliate you,and see you only as clay.but he’s a good guy,so does all of that.doesn’t that make himan

looking forward to the further greatness of this series!↠4.5 stars'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '...I have no idea how this review got deleted, but here is a reupload from my blog!If I cannot be better than them, I will be so much worse.God, this book killed me.The Cruel Princehas just about what you’d expect from Black: court intrigue, an atmosphere of terror, vaguely dark romance, and a main character who is a terrible person, but is also so interesting. Plus some interesting dynamics and setup for an even better sequel. Needless to say, I found it delightful.I think Black’s tendency is to start a story with a badass opening, then spend 200 pages on slow buildup. At first I thought it was just because this is a series beginner, but the more I think about it, the more I realize her stories never have a typical growth and climax. Instead, she slowly escalates tension until suddenly the situation is horrible and you’re left wondering how these characters even got there. It’s an odd style, and one that will be divisive among readers, but it works for me.The plot here is just as slow-burning as usual, perhaps even more so. I personally thought it suited the story quite well. Even when I was slumping, this book was easy to come back to and enjoy. I have to admit, at spots the court intrigue got confusing. Main characters were easy to remember, but I couldn’t tell most of the Elder King’s children apart.Maybe my favorite part of this book was the character work. Holly Black is very talented at getting side characters to read real, even without much focus on them. But the real strength of this book is Jude’s flawed, morally grey character. I fucking loved her. She’s not the greatest person, but she’s so incredibly aware of it that I found it hard not to love her.I also wanted to spare a paragraph for the romance. There is a sort-of romance in the first half, and it is honestly the weakest part of the first three-quarters. (See my updates for this book.)Thankfully, this thrown-in and tensionless romance is improved upon further into the book. I’m not going to spoil it, exactly, but we all know Black loves her Hades/Persephone-esque dynamics. The dynamic between the two characters who I think will get together really turned me off in the first half; I was looking out for some kind of lacking-in-consent bad-boys-are-hawt type thing. That’s not what you’ll find here. This is much more of a genuine Hades/Persephone dynamic than a bad-boys-are-hot romance. I’ve written about the difference before on my blog, but this is one of the better handlings of it I’ve seen. There was one scene in this book between them that… well, I think my brain just screamed “holy shit” for a minute straight. One of those scenes I’m going to bookmark and reread over and over again.Anyway, I definitely loved this. When is book two coming out again?Brief note before I finish this review, and this doesn’t need much commentary: Ben and Severin had a cameo in this. I almost cried, embarrassingly enough. The Darkest Part of the Forest is one of my favorite books ever. According to a couple other reviews, some of the side characters are also cameos from her first fae series, if you’re at all interested! I didn’t notice because I’ve never read it.

No, scratch that, I didn’t have expectations, I never do, never dare hope—I usually try to not expect much of a book so I wouldn't be disappointed—what I had was simply assumptions about how it was gonna be. And I was completely and utterly wrong.People make this seem like a romance-oriented book; it is not.This book is less about the romance (which only starts to show itself a little by the end) and more about games, intrigue and, most importantly, the characters. It’s about anger. Betrayal. Revenge. Secrets and, above all, power. This is the dangerous tale of a human girl who grew up in faerieland and has endured much cruelty and pain, is bullied at school, because of being mortal and weak.She will show you she is not.Let no one call Jude Duarteweak.That’s what comes of hungering for something: You forget to check if it’s rotten before you gobble it down.She will be the human who looks at all that faeries have, acknowledges that she, as a human, is unworthy of those things, still wants them anyways, and thus takes them. Faeries might always be better than her, but she can be much, much worse. It should not surprise you that I adore her, then.The Cruel Princeis a cruel, enchanting tale of a cruel, enchanting people in a cruel, enchanting world.

For he kills her and takes the three little girls to faerieland. For in Faerie, there are no fish sticks, no ketchup, and no television.“Because you’re like a story that hasn’t happened yet. Because I want to see what you will do. I want to be part of the unfolding of the tale.”What there is in Fearie is a court ruled by the High King, presiding over the three factions of the Seelie Court, the Unseelie court, and the wild fey. And that king has a general—a faerie whose wife left him pregnant with his heir, a faerie who slaughtered a family one not so ordinary night and took three human girls.Jude is the youngest of the three, the younger twin, and she wants nothing more than to belong, craves nothing more than being knighted and a permanent part of the court. Even if most of the faeries hate humans; even if she is bullied at school by the youngest prince and his gang; even if she is belittled and bloodied and nearly killed.So it should come as a surprise to no one that she would lie and spy and become a vengeful murderess who changes the game. It does anyways.“I am tired of caring,” I say. “Why should I?”“Because they could kill you!”“They better,” I say to her. “Because anything less than that isn’t going to work.”✧ Storytelling ✧Shame on you, Mary, for waiting so long to pick up a masterpiece ofHolly Black’s.A tale so well told. A twisted fairytale so mesmerising. An atmosphere so immersive and pulsing. An eye for detail and consideration and clever themes and additions. A hand wielding words and metaphors as a master swordsman would a sword.I read my first Black book and did not look back.“I’ve seen many impossible things. I have seen the acorn before the oak. I have seen the spark before the flame. But never have I seen such as this: A dead woman living. A child born from nothing.”✧ Characters ✧★Jude:Call her a wrecking ball if you want, call her an annoying bitch if you dare, I would only say you don’t comprehend the joy of jumping into the canyon of anger, the peace in throwing rules and caution into the wind, the freedom in crossing the line and embracing the glorious beauty of revenge. “It’s the thrill of leaping without being able to see the ground below you, right before you realize that’s called falling.” I would say that you’ve never known the colours. I would say you are blind.She is a prideful, unyielding fighter who hates being vulnerable, being controlled. She is a vengeful, violent liar who adores power, adores attention.She is angry and dark and probably needs to see a therapist but, if you told her so, would most likely tell you to go eff yo self and that she can manage herself quite nicely thank you very much.And if you think she’s starting to sound like me...then whatever do you mean *smiles sweetly*“If you hurt me, I wouldn’t cry. I would hurt you back.”I’d heardcriticism of Jude’s reaction to the trauma of her childhoodand agreed with it for the beginning chapters, but then I realised that it’s merely that she handles the trauma differently.What Jude does is escape thinking about what happened, flee her feelings and fear; and it naturally results in her becoming out of touch with her emotions. She endures and pushes it into the back of her brain due to not knowing another way to cope and that’s the way that comes naturally to her. She is always afraid, always on alert, so she’s grown numb and used to it, so she’s turned tired and angry, so she lashes out.In fact, her mental state is captured accurately, because our personality shapes our response to trauma the same way trauma shapes our personality.She doesn’t have nightmares not because her trauma has been ignored, but because she can’t calm her nerves enough to even sleep.Before, I never knew how far I would go. Now I believe I have the answer. I will go as far as there is to go. I will go way too far.And if you put that kind of personality under pressure, it acts much like an elastic object: springing upon release, going wild and hitting everything at close range. She was raised in a house of butchery by a man who delights in war and death and conflict. And because such a man was her father and such a man killed her father, this is the birth of a murderer. Her composed smiles coming unraveled, coming undone.“I thought I was supposed to be good and follow the rules. But I am done with being weak. I am done with being good. I think I am going to be something else.”★Cardan:A few months ago a friend of mine forced me to watch the kdramaBoys Over Flowersin exchange for me asking her to watch the BBCSherlock; the deal was that we’d each watch 6 episodes of our respective shows and stop after that if we’re no longer interested. I, ofc, stopped after 6 because I just can’t connect with kdaramas. But I’m glad I watched those episodes, because I can now write this:Cardan Greenbriar is literally and thoroughly Gu Jun-pyo fromBoys Over Flowers.But where I only found Jun-pyo entertaining, IloveCardan, probably because of Jude’s difference from the female lead of the show. With Jun-pyo it was just a petulant boyo lashing out and being angry and bullying and abusing a powerless girl (who still got back at him impressively but still, their personalities where the opposites) while with Cardanit’s a sparring match.I called him “a simple old-school bully” the very first time we were introduced, and I was both right and wrong. Right because he is an old-school bully, yet wrong because he is not simply so but playfully; Cardan is a clever cruel prince, an angry spoiled/abused child, and a charming adorable coward. Too young, too weak, too mean, too precious! But not ambitious, not like Jude.I blame you guys for being disappointed at first; it was unfair to feel annoyed that he couldn’t fill the shoes I’d thought Holly Black was intending for him when shewasn’tintending those shoes for him. He has his own shiny shoes to stand in and THANK GOD.“There’s safety in being awful.”✯Locke:First character who intrigued me with his bored, manipulative ways. I spent a long time just repeatingwhat’s his game what’s his gamein my notes, I swear, and I find it rather perfect that his game is just that—a game. This drama-loving fox is one I simultaneously want to kiss and kill and absolutely cannot get enough of.✯Taryn:Jude’s twin sister is much like her while still being the opposite. She, too, wants to belong and would do anything to achieve it; she, too, can be cold and manipulative as the faeries and craves their exotic danger, growing used to recognising bad things as good; and she, too, has had to become something else to survive, something not so human. But where Jude is wildfire, she is ice; one is raging, the other composed. Both burn you in the end.“Desire is an odd thing. As soon as it’s sated, it transmutes. If we receive golden thread, we desire the golden needle.”☆ Those aren’t the only ones that made an impact:Madocwith his anger issues and twisted love,Viviwith her raging selfish heart that encourages the same trait in others,Orianawho is way more than she seems. All layered, none all-evil, being a mix of cruel and gentle. I heard someone say this book has an all-Slytherin cast, and I’m inclined to agree—no wonder I enjoy them all so much.✧ Relationships ✧“Like taking a dare to run over knives, like an adrenaline strike of lightning, like the moment when you’ve swum too far out in the sea and there is no going back, only cold black water closing over your head.❥Romance:Can I just say Chapter 25 & 26? BECAUSE CHAPTER 25 & 26! To be frank with you, I wasn’t sure at first about these two as I had my doubts regarding Cardan being someone who could possibly match Jude in strength, but I now adore them because I realised the nature of dynamic is a game wheresheis the one with the power (while being terrified of him ever having any power) and he is drawn to that. He likes to challenge her, question her,tryto best her, while actually delighting in her holding a dagger at his throat.They spar; they fight; they have (more or less) the same personality, liars and deceivers and and power-oriented people.Their only difference is that he’s a pleasure-seeking coward where she’s a purposeful warrior, and that somehow makes them an even better match.“He’s flint, you’re tinder.”❥Familial Bonds:I’ve already talked too much so I’ll just say that the sisterhood, brother-sister bond, father-daughter relationship...all are written tangibly, conveying the complicated and contradictory feelings that come with being a family (and one so messed up as this) quite perfectly. It was a gem to read.✧ Worldbuilding ✧Faerie might be beautiful, but its beauty is like a golden stag’s carcass, crawling with maggots beneath his hide, ready to burst.This land of beautiful nightmares, these creatures of twilight and glamours, these clawed hands bearing nevermore and faerie fruit with their superstitious-like practices (e.g. having a necklace of dried rowan berries or wearing your stockings inside out) that are not simply superstitions, all serve to exceptionally bring this world into life and prove that world building is, indeed, Holly Black’s ultimate strength.In the end, readingThe Cruel Princewith its mythical magic and all the cruelties, deceptions, and (hypocritical) prejudice of its people, feels like wandering through a fairytale that chose the path on its left somewhere down the road, refusing to go right. And you bet I always choose the path on my left as well.✧ Companions ✧Book series playlist:Spotify URLBooks in series:➳ The Cruel Prince (The Folk of the Air, #1) ★★★★★➳The Lost Sisters(The Folk of the Air, #1.5) ★★★★☆➳The Wicked King(The Folk of the Air, #2) ★★★★★➳The Queen of Nothing(The Folk of the Air, #3) ★★★★☆➳How the King of Elfhame Learned to Hate Stories(The Folk of the Air, #3.5) ☆☆☆☆☆""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I know you missed my star auctions… Here comes the new one! Let’s start with five billion! Did I hear five centillion! Are you out of your mind? I don’t think there are centillion stars on the universe! Well, red head lady slaps the bidder and gave this book FIVE CENTILLION STARS anyways! SOLD with an all exclusive trip to fae world ( limitless Chardonnay and tequila shots included)Awwwwwwww I’m in love with this book! This is definitely a Tarantino story taken place at the Fae World and we have hero and heroine (half human half villanelle) who are cheater, liar, playing dirty and unfair and they’re match made in heaven. Normally I want to punch the people with those attributes but I’m drawn to them! I officially let them under my skin and now I’m singing “Hey Jude, don’t make it bad, take a sad song and make it better”This book is dark, entertaining, captivating and addictive. We have blood freezing, heart throbbing parts like GOT’s Red Wedding. But the worst part is it finishes so fast now my hands are shaking, legs are tapping, eyes are getting watery, I want it more and I have only one book left! I know the second one is even better. And as soon as I finish it, I’ll suffer from worse addiction withdrawals! There are 49 days for third book’s release ( shit October is 31 days so it is 50 days!!!! NOOOOOO!!!)As a precaution my husband hid my kindle to prevent me starting the second book and locked me in our wine cellar (Ok, kidding, we’re not rich! He locked me at my bedroom with one case of Chardonnay, enough food for feeding an army -equal to my one course meal!-) but he forgot I had my spare key. Anyways, I stopped ironing his clothes and dishwashing as a punishment (Well, actually I never do them but don’t bother! I’m 2000’s Peggy Bundy with no children and better hairstyle!)So the things made me falling in love and craving 200 sequel books of this series are:-AMAZING CHARACTERIZATIONS:Two misfit, outsider, black sheep of the families, did I tell you how much I love those wicked hero and ruthless heroine? : Jude and Cardan are my new Mickey and Mallory, Joker and Harley Quinn, Honey Bunny and Pumpkin.Jude witnessed to her parents’ murder when she was a little girl and has been whisked away to live in Faerie world where she is neglected, bullied and unwanted from the others.And Cardan is youngest son of High King, tormented by his own brothers and grow up in a world of wildness, cruelness, savageness. He hasn’t been loved, pampered and only way to survive is acting like he didn’t care anything about power games and politics, staying drunk and making vicious and wicked circle of friends: Nicasia: power thirsty, Locke: drama king, Valerian: violence lover.Less lovable and bringers of my slap urge: Locke and Taryn ( no spoilers but they are spineless human beings! Correction: woman being and faerie being)-CLIFFHANGER: I was expecting something surprising will come out and my spider senses didn’t surprise me (I climb to the walls to celebrate it)-FAST PACING, BLOODY ACTION PARTS, MANIPULATIONS, MIND AND POWER GAMES: I wish Holly Black took the seat of the last season of GOT and gave the bloody, violent and satisfying ending we deserved. At least she didn’t write something about a raven king, right?-LOVE STORY: Those characters are in love with power and they don’t know what it means to love somebody but they’re hopelessly drawn each other. This is Shakespearean kind of tragic story and I can feel it doesn’t have a proper HEA! But this obsessive, uncontrollable attraction of dark hero and heroine put a big, widen Joker smile on my face. It’s hot as hell!So 50 days to 3rd book and I’ll wait at least two weeks for the second book. ( It’s Catch 22 because reading and waiting are equally painful! I wish I could be patient enough till all the books release and I can devour them one by one) As a summary: My vote for Best Fantasy this year is obvious! This is also gotten its place at my all-time favorite books list!'}]"

I\'m already missing these characters so much.The following review will contain major spoilers fromHouse of Flame and Shadowso if you haven\'t finished reading I advise you not to read this review until then.Also, Sarah recently confirmed Crescent City book 4 is happening (probably in a few years). This one is a conclusion for Bryce\'s story.[MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW]...................................This book was one hell of an emotional ride and it might come as a surprise that I haven\'t rated it 5-star, but the more I thought about the book the more issues I found in it so I decided to deduct it from my 4-star rating to 3.5-star which is how I feel.I got some theories right which I\'m very excited about, I also got some theories wrong which was expected because I knew Sarah would throw a curveball at me in this book. It\'s fun to explore the possibilities as a reader but also I love it when the author surprises me and Sarah did, especially in part 1!!!Let\'s begin with the ACOTAR segment:Keep in mind that SJM changed the timeline gap she originally intended between ACOSF and HOFAS (which was around 6-9 months in her first draft)The gap between ACOSF\'s ending and HOFAS events isapproximately 3 months(Nesta said she killed Lanthys 7 months ago, which happened a month before Winter Solstice in ACOSF). So it\'s June/beginning of Summer in the ACOTAR world.The Middengard Worm making a cameo was not on my bingo card.- Nesta deserves a 5⭐️ for being the badass that she was in all the scenes. I loved seeing her in action and to see glimpses of the warm person behind an ice cold mask she mastered wearing. We see more of her sentimental side when Bryce plays music (in the bonus chapter) and when Nesta bids Ember and co. farewell. Nesta is set up to be an important player in ACOTAR5 now that she was left with Gwydion/Starsword and to find out why she got the eight-pointed star tattoo.- Azriel, my beloved, also deserves a 5⭐️. Seeing the spymaster and the Shadowsinger in action alongside Nesta was fun but also the crumbs SJM littered in the ACOTAR segment for him makes me even more thrilled for his arc in ACOTAR5, now that is a protagonist that is being well-prepped for his own book. We touch upon his mother and fondness of music in the bonus chapter, we still don\'t know how he got Truth-teller and the fact that his precious knife was originally owned by Enalius (the first of the Illyrians) and that is another tie to Illyria, we don\'t know how his shadows and magic work, he finds out through the Asteri under the Prison that the Illyrians were made by them, and honestly SJM gave more than what I expected when it comes to him. His personality is even more fleshed out and to my delight many of my friends and readers are warming up to him (he always had a personality you just needed to look closer).""[...] that wasn\'t there as Azriel landed fromabove them. His wings were spread so wide they nearly touched either side of the cavern.""Thank you Janet for confirming who has the largest wingspan yet again.- Now, Nesta and Azriel as a duo are incredible!!! I love their bond and friendship and seeing how much they look out and care about each other. They understand one another and that has been obvious to us since ACOSF, they both master putting on an icy mask to hide their emotions.Rhysand alongside Amren made a brief appearance at the beginning of the book and he seems apprehensive about the Asteri and the fact that anyone can walk into their world (I think we will see implications of that in ACOTAR5 being that Rhys saw two alien females fall into his world only months apart). He\'ll grapple with the question of who else can enter their world and how do they put a stop to it.I loved the ACOTAR segment so much because it was lore galore and I was craving all that info dump since ACOSF.The whole history of High King Fionn, Queen Theia, and Pelias was darker than I expected and I\'m glad Fionn did not turn out to be evil. I still feel enraged and devastated with what happened with Helena and Silene (Theia\'s daughters). It\'s almost impossible to excuse their actions but it is still sad that Theia damned her own family and people because she thirsty for more power.I can\'t wait to see what more will be revealed in ACOTAR5!The ACOTAR-related bonus chapters include: Walmart edition (Bryce, Nesta, Azriel) + BAM/Indigo (Ember and Randall).My current theory is some of the events in ACOTAR5 will happen in parallel with HOFAS (at least the first 30% of the book).To conclude this part, I\'m glad the crossover did not take over a big chunk of the book because it IS a Crescent City book.I wasn\'t rooting for a major crossover either with Throne of Glass (as much as it pains me to say it because I miss them), it would\'ve tangled up all 3 series and we would end up with a messy storyline. Major crossovers work for movies, not for books.The crossover was important for ACOTAR and CC because they are tied by history and we got answers that are important for both. We got resolution for it in this book, but not yet for ACOTAR. I didn\'t clarify earlier, we did get some TOG crumbs but it doesn\'t have the same level of implications as ACOTAR and it does leave the door open for a future crossover, but as of now we know most of TOG storylines had their resolution but Sarah did leave the door open for more stories.Now... moving on toCrescent CityI was rooting for Bryce but I did find her reckless and insufferable in many moments. It makes me miss HOEAB Bryce but in this book she\'s coming off too much self-absorbed.It\'s hard for me to buy the suprise schemes Bryce pre-planned, I mean it works for a character like Aelin but not Bryce. Certain scenes are convincing and some came out of the blue or were too convenient.Hunt is my darling and it was obvious throughout the book he is hesitant and triggered by his trauma since Shahar\'s rebellion so he will question every step they take, and Bryce seems pretty dismissive to him during those moments which... is not doing her any favors. She\'s not helping him through it and it makes my heart break even more for Hunt because he is so wary of upsetting her about it. Like, Bryce darling... he went through very gruesome torture sessions recently so cut him so slack.Don\'t get me wrong, I LOVE Quinlar and I\'m always rooting for them but... I hoped we would be past their trust issues and disagreements over minor things. I still want them to argue and fight, I don\'t want them to be a perfect couple but all this still rubbed me the wrong way.I also expected a soul-shattering, emotional reunion after the whole ""our love spans across time and universes"" quote but I felt underwhelmed with what I got given one of them was in another universe and the other was being tortured.Still, I got many other moments that I loved and cried and gushed over. Especially their bonus chapter!On the other hand, I devoured all of Ruhn and Lidia\'s chapters. Lidia\'s chapters especially are just *chef\'s kiss*.This book made me fall in love with them more and I was eating up all the angst, all the longing, and the intense sexual tension between them.I wish they got their own book though I need more of them.There were a few surprises about Lidia that I did not expect but I also love that for her and it helped to better understand her motivations.The chapters I struggled with the most are Ithan\'s and Tharion\'s. I\'m sorry but they were a snoozefest except for a few scenes.I\'m happy with what Ithan became and the resolution he got towards the end of the book, but the whole Fendyr/Reaper storyline wasn\'t all that interesting. At least I got more of Jesiba who also has her own very interesting backstory.Also, totally rooting for him and Perry.Tharion\'s chapters didn\'t get interesting to me until Sathia came into the picture. It\'s painful to see him make one miserable decision after another. It\'s like Sarah testing how much can one character fuck up.Sathia was a delightful surprise, I didn\'t expect Flynn\'s sister who made her seem to be nothing but trouble come off as a compelling character. I hope we get her POV in CC4. I want to explore a Fae female\'s POV who lived among the Fae and how their views and treatment of females turned her into who she is and how she can move on from it.I\'m a big fan of marriage of convenience trope so I\'ll consume all of it (if SJM manages to make Tharion more likable).Flynn (and his sprites), Declan, Baxian played important roles and I still adore them. I just can\'t help but think of how Baxian will live on without his mate Danika, it hurts.I was totally bamboozled by who Hunt\'s father is, let\'s just say he was conceived through team effort. He has three dads.Moving on to the villains:I\'ll start with the character that had the most satisfying death and it\'s Pollux. Lidia the female that you are. It was perfection.I didn\'t like how the Autumn King and King Morven of Avallen were off\'ed. It felt too convenient and I wanted a more satisfying resolution between Bryce/Ruhn and the Autumn King. He can get killed all over again for all I care, I just hoped it would be under a different scenario.Good riddance Sabine is dead.I expected something more in the final confrontation with the Asteri but it wasn\'t as epic as I expected it to be. I mean I\'m glad they\'re gone but I don\'t know... it was too easy. I don\'t think it even took 50 pages to off them.I felt like every villain was eliminated way too easily and way too conveniently. I think it would\'ve been better to spread out their deaths between HOSAB and HOFAS.I\'m glad that we saw Aidas, Apollion, and Thanatos but I was hoping for an epic battle between them and the Asteri. That one was too quick.There is one trope Sarah likes to pull in the climax but I\'m getting bored of it because she did it too many times to the point it no longer is impactful as it intends to be.Another thing that threw me off was shift between different character POVs mid chapter which felt like a whiplash and needed better formatting. To me I don\'t think Sarah is weak when it comes to writing multiple POVs (look at Throne of Glass), but for some reason it didn\'t have a smooth flow in this book.Overall, I did enjoy parts of book but Sarah took a big risk with the crossover.Though will say I\'m left with questions like:• What happened to the comms Crystal Ruhn gave Bryce before she escaped to Prythian?• What about all the Thurr connections and comparisons to Hunt?• What\'s the point of Ariadne and her dragon flame being able to burn even Princes of Hel?• Did we just forget about Viktoria?• Octartis (the Asteri) was a female in HOSAB, but in HOFAS it\'s a male?There are obvious continuity errors, typos and inconsistencies this book suffered from.Don\'t let my review impact your experience with this book or your rating, I love these characters and this world and I will miss them dearly but I always planned to keep my review transparent when it comes to this book. Sarah is one of my all-time favorite authors and half of her books are 5-stars to me so you\'ll know it will take a lot to sway me from that rating.I will definitely revisit these books in the future, I have attachment issues with Sarah\'s books.I will end this review with my favorite quote in HOFAS that made me sob even harder the moment I read it because of what it meant to these characters and to me.The friends they’d made were what mattered in the end. Not the enemies.Through love, all is possible.Thank you Sarah for another emotional journey I\'m forever grateful for the stories and the characters you always gift us ❤️'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3⭐️ Definitely had its moments but it wasn’t my favorite.***This review containsSPOILERSso if you have not read HOFAS or the previous books in the series, STOP SCROLLING ***PS: If you want to read the bonus chapters, I have them ALL on my story highlights on Instagram @thebiglittlelibrary 🫶 My favorites are Target\'s & BAM\'s!...Here\'s a fun, little summary of what happens:✨ ACOTAR crossover✨ Bryce eats a magic bean✨ Middengard Worm cameo✨ History lesson with a ghost✨ Nesta slayyyyyys✨ Tharion is an idiot✨ Baxian gets hungry in the dungeons✨ Ithan packs one hell of a punch✨ Lidia Cervos serves cunt✨ Boring Quinlar reunion✨ ""We All Live In A Yellow Submarine"" 🎶✨ Lidia\'s is legit Mother✨ Lots of sad boi energy✨ Hunt has a wardrobe malfunction 🍆✨ Asteri just being their usual asshole selves✨ Hypaxia is . . . there✨ “Don’t Fear The Reaper” 🎶✨ A random arranged marriage✨ Hel is DTF with an alliance✨ Hunt learns he was a test tube baby✨ Parricide 👏✨ Avallen gets a makeover✨ Bryce becomes death✨ Ithan nuts up✨ Hypaxia cures COVID✨ Epic final battle✨ Hel + sprites to the rescue✨AelinLidia serves even more cunt✨ Pollux gets fucked✨ ""Super Massive Black Hole"" 🎶✨ Bryce takes a trip to space✨ Hunt becomes Iron Man✨ Jesiba pulls a Ben Solo✨ Happily Ever After✨ My Little Pony reboot✨ House of Many Waters COMING SOON featuring Tharion (and Ithan)My Thoughts:Was it a bad story? No. But was it the best? No. There were things I liked and didn\'t like. I\'ll be going over all of it. So buckle the fuck up because this is going to be one hell of a review.First, I want to address the ACOTAR crossover.Honestly, I\'m indifferent about it all. I was surprised we mostly see Bryce interacting with just Nesta and Azriel, but I wasn\'t mad about it. I actually liked Bryce and Nesta\'s interactions and could DEFINITELY see them as friends under different circumstances. But honestly, Nesta was the best part of this entire crossover. Even after ACOSF I wasn’t a huge Nesta fan but after this, I really like her. I enjoyed seeing her from a total stranger\'s perspective!The entire point of the crossover was learning about Theia and her connection to the ACOTAR world - and it did its job there. HOWEVER, knowing that Hel knew the same history and could have easily shared this with Bryce is where my problem with the crossover comes in. If Hel had stepped in to give Bryce all the information (which Aidas says he didn\'t do because \'Bryce wasn\'t ready\'), there would be no need for a crossover. I mean, I guess at some point she’d have to visit the Fae world to absorb Silene’s Starborn power, but I believe it could have been done without even seeing any of the ACOTAR characters. Which pretty much makes me believe SJM did this as a fan service and/or as a way to get fans who haven\'t read CC, to read it. It was a genius marketing strategy, but I don\'t think it did much for the story. And unfortunately, I’m hearing from quite a few people that the crossover disappointed them. So, in the end, it may have backfired on SJM. But if you enjoyed the crossover, I\'d like to know and hear your thoughts on why. 😊What I liked:The overall plot.Listen, I gotta give it to SJM, she sure knows how to weave a story together. It\'s wild to me that even the smallest of details tend to have some significance later on in the story - things you may not have even realized are of any importance at all. I enjoyed the journey we\'ve been on since book one, and I thought how everything came together by the end was phenomenal.The insanity and possibilities of the Maasverse.I am still reeling from all the connections Midgard has to the worlds of ACOTAR and TOG. We mostly focus on the connections to the ACOTAR realm (the Fae home world) but we get some bits and pieces of the ties to the TOG realm thanks to the stories from Aidas and Jesiba. I am honestly in awe of how Sarah J. Maas is able to keep all this information straight and continue to build upon it. This is what I really admire and respect about the Crescent City series. From a fantasy standpoint, I think it was incredibly well done. This is a complex world with a complex history and magic system that can definitely be understood by a first time reader, but is probably appreciated more by those who\'ve read her other series. I\'m excited to see what Sarah does next in terms of connecting these worlds in the future.History lessons with Theia\'s daughter, Silene.This was so freaking cool. I absolutely LOVED learning more about our beloved ACOTAR world as well as the beginnings of Midgard and the role the Asteri played in all of it. It was a lot darker than I expected, which made it that much more interesting. The only thing I predicted beforehand was that the Prison was the Dusk Court, but besides that everything else was new information and super fun to learn about!Lidia mother-fucking Cervos.She is a baddie. Period. End of story. The things she\'s done. . . the things she\'s put herself through for years all for the sake of her sons. . . I\'m in awe. Lidia is the definition of strength. Her backstory was so heartbreaking. I legitimately cried. The way she sacrifices her entire being (mind, body, and soul) really reminded me of the way Rhys sacrificed himself while under the mountain. Both these characters put on a mask and became monsters in order to protect the ones they love. Even how they act after they are free and deal with the trauma is very similar. There\'s a lot of parallels between the two, which is why I probably love them both so much. Honestly, Lidia is my favorite character of the entire series and I wish we\'d gotten more time with her. Also, the fact she’s a descendent of King Brannon from the TOG world and therefore related to Aelin and Dorian in some way was not a surprise but super cool nevertheless.Lidia and Ruhn\'s romance.These two have my whole heart. 🫶 I absolutely ADORE them! They\'re probably my second favorite mated couple besides Feysand. They went through absolute hell in this book. Ruhn getting tortured and Lidia having to participate was so hard to stomach. Lidia saving Ruhn\'s life and nearly dying only for him to say“You’re dead to me,”made me want to scream. And finding out Lidia has children and her real motives for being the Hind absolutely broke my heart. 😭 They endure so much in such a short amount of time, and even though there was so much broken trust between them, they\'re able to accept the past and be there for one another. Lidia and Ruhn deserved their HEA. And if you haven\'t yet, RUN to the link in my bio at @thebiglittlelibrary and read their bonus chapter because it is so perfect!Ithan\'s character arc and story development.Did his rise to power feel a bit random and rushed? Yes. But I didn\'t expect it, so I liked that his story wasn\'t predictable - especially when he kills Sigrid by punching her through the throat. I GASPED so hard. lol Ithan was actually someone who really annoyed me in book two - he was immature and seemed lost - but his guilt for killing Sigrid takes him on a journey that ends with him coming into his own and finding his purpose as Prime. He grew up a lot and I honestly wouldn\'t be mad about seeing more of his story in future CC books. I\'m also excited by the fact he has the elemental power of snow! Just another connection to the TOG world.What I didn\'t like:The multiple, mid-chapter POV changes DROVE ME NUTS.This was probably my biggest issue. Most of the chapters had three different POVs. And at the beginning of the book, there were four main plots happening at the same time: Bryce in the Fae home world; Hunt, Ruhn, and Baxian being tortured, Tharion with the Viper Queen, and Ithan and the other random side characters trying to figure out wtf to do. So each chapter, we\'d follow one character and just as things were starting to ramp up, we\'d shift to another character in a completely different situation. Because of these constantly changing POV, the story didn\'t flow well and I wasn\'t able to truly immerse myself. I felt removed while reading. Maybe if each chapter had only focused on one, maybe two (max) POVs, the story might not have felt so disjointed.The predictable ending.While I enjoyed the Asteri plot, I thought the ending was predictable and incredibly low stakes (since you know no one important is going to actually die and stay dead). This could be because I\'ve read SJM\'s other series and have noticed some patterns and similarities to how she writes her endings. The allying with the \'dark\' forces of Hel, the sprites showing up last minute, the Lidia and Pollux confrontation, and Bryce dying and coming back to life, felt similar to the end of ACOWAR. And while the ending had a different plot, the familiarity of it all didn\'t allow for me to feel any surprise. It definitely wasn\'t a bad ending . . . I just didn\'t really pull me in.The story is plot heavy with not enough character / relationship growth.There was too much going on plot-wise with too many different storylines and too many POVs. While everything neatly came together in the end, the journey to get there was messy and overly complex. I think SJM could have found a way to simplify the plot and cut some POVs to make this easier to digest. But at the same time, because there was so much focus on the plot, a few of the characters and relationships didn\'t get the attention they deserved. Specifically, Hunt and Ruhn dealing with the trauma from their torture, Lidia dealing with her trauma, Ruhn and Lidia\'s relationship (see below), Ithan\'s and his character arc, and Tharion as a whole because what growth has he even gone through throughout this entire series?Not only did Ruhn and Lidia not get enough screen time to truly work through their trauma, trust issues, and anger, but THEY WERE ROBBED of a beautiful romance journey.(Sort of how we were robbed of more Elorcan in TOG.) I totally get the need for more plot in this book because it\'s the ending to the series and things need to wrap up. However, we barely scratched the surface of Ruhn and Lidia\'s romance in HOSAB. And then in this book, things are bad for a while before they come together without spending adequate time resolving any issues, healing from their traumas, and growing as a couple. I understand that it wasn\'t possible to do this in an already 838 page book, but I truly believe other things should have been cut to make their story more impactful. Or, I think they shouldn\'t have been a couple at the end so we\'d get a book that focuses on Ruhn and Lidia. Regardless, I think not diving deep into their story was a missed opportunity.Hunt and Bryce\'s \'reunion\'.This was one of the most anticlimactic scenes in the entire book. I was expecting Hunt and Bryce to immediately jump into each other\'s arms . . . to sob . . . to kiss . . . and say some incredibly romantic and sappy shit to one another. BUT NONE OF THAT HAPPENS. After everything they went through to find each other again, this was not the reunion I was hoping for.Hunt and Bryce as a coupleListen, I don\'t want to get into it but I don\'t think they have chemistry. Compared to SJM\'s other couples, they\'re definitely one of the weaker pairings. I get that in the story, they supposedly have this insane connection that spans across time and space, but I just never felt it. Side note: I LEGIT forgot they were married. 😂If you like Bryce and Hunt (and the rest of the Crescent City characters), I believe you\'ll really enjoy this story. But if you\'ve struggled to like or even connect with most of them, this story will probably disappoint you.Unfortunately, I fall in the latter group. As a whole, I think the CC characters are a bunch of immature idiots who act more like the stereotypical frat guys and sorority girls than people capable of saving the world. I mean, the majority of the characters are in their 20s but even the ones who are older still act childish at times.Bryce.I\'m sorry, but she\'s my least favorite SJM FMC. She\'s a selfish, immature, pick-me girl. If I had to read another sentence about how hot she was according to EVERY SINGLE GUY besides her brother, and listen to more of her shitty jokes (which EVERY SINGLE GUY thinks is so fucking funny), I was going to scream. And I get Bryce is a sarcastic bitch to everyone, but there\'s a time and a place for everything, and being obnoxious doesn\'t ever actually get anyone anywhere.Bryce also isn\'t a character that earned my respect as The Chosen One. Let\'s look at the origins of SJM\'s other main FMCs. Feyra was a hunter and Aelin was an assassin, while Bryce was . . . a party girl? The other FMCs proved themselves to be worthy of being the Chosen One but Bryce had zero skills to qualify her as a fighter or good leader yet somehow she was able to amass a group of people to follow her. Also, she never learned new skills. She solely relied on her inherited powers and the skills of others. Nepotism at its finest.Bryce was incredibly selfish when she unleashed an Asteri onto the Fae home world without a second thought for the millions of lives there . . . all because she wants answers, which she doesn’t really even get! Thank the Cauldron Nesta was there to save the day! And then, when Bryce tells Hunt, her supposed soulmate, to sack up and get over his trauma. Girl, WHAT?!Lastly, Bryce hating ALL fae because she’s had some bad experiences with a few seems incredibly close minded and just plain stupid. What about the fae in her life like Ruhn, Declan, Flynn and countless others who are kind and fight for what’s right? Apparently they don’t count. But how dumb is she to write off an entire race/species based on the actions of a few?Tharion.I didn\'t care for him in book one. I disliked him in book two. And I absolutely hate him in book three. I mean, does ANYONE like Tharion? Please, if you do, let me know in the comments and tell me why because I must be missing something. From what we\'ve seen, he is a selfish, immature, fuck boi that doesn\'t go through any character growth throughout this ENTIRE series. I was extremely annoyed that his POV took up a huge chunk of this book when it added little to this story. But it looks like SJM was mainly setting things up for him (and Ithan) to be the MCs in her next CC book. 🙄 I know I\'ll read it because it\'s SJM, but I won\'t be happy about it. He better undergo a serious transformation, like Nesta in ACOSF, or else that\'ll be the end of my CC journey.So many side characters that don\'t matter.Declan and Flynn.Okay, Declan\'s THE tech guy who only has use whenever SJM needed someone to hack something. How convenient. 🙄 But Flynn . . . I CANNOT for the life of me remember anything useful he did.Baxian.He\'s Danika\'s mate. Cool. And? I guess he\'s a hunk of meat that Bryce can call on during a fight. But as a character, he\'s not THAT special.Sigrid.She had so much potential but only propelled Ithan\'s character arc forward. Super pointless but probably setting up for the next book.Sathia.The most random of all characters. She pops up out of nowhere (I genuinely forgot Flynn had a sister) and married Tharion? This has to be a setup for the next book, but it just added another unnecessary piece to an already overly complicated story.Fury and Juniper.Bryce\'s ONLY female friends and I forgot about them lol. The fact Fury doesn\'t play an active role in this series is another missed opportunity. What\'s the point in Bryce having a badass friend if she doesn\'t even help??? I truly believe Sarah could and should have cut out a few of these people to simplify the story.Aidas\' reason for not just telling Bryce the entire truth about everything was flimsy.Apparently, it\'s because ""Bryce wasn\'t ready"". He couldn\'t risk her telling the wrong person and the Asteri finding out. So instead, he\'d rather have Bryce go on an insane goose chase and risk her life doing a bunch of other dangerous shit because he didn\'t think he could tell her the truth and convince her to keep her mouth shut. This entire situation just brought up my PTSD from when Danika withheld the truth from Bryce. Riddle me this, how is it that someone who no one seems to trust ends up with the most power and becomes the savior of Midgard??I also found it strange that Hel, a realm that has been trying to eradicate the Asteri for 15,000 years from Midgard and is currently helping other realms fight these beings, are fine sitting back, letting millions, if not, billions die throughout the years. From what I remember, after the initial rebellion with Theia, they tried helping once by creating the Thunderbirds. But that was eons ago and I don\'t believe they really tried since. It\'s like they were fine waiting till one of Theia\'s heirs was ready to take on the mantle and become the catalyst for a successful rebellion. But again, once they found Bryce, they didn\'t do shit to help her understand her powers or the history of Midgard and the Asteri. Ugh. Why??? There just isn\'t a good enough reason. So overall, I think Hel not stepping in more didn\'t make sense for a realm that is \'eager\' to help the universe, but also Aidas not revealing the whole truth earlier was such a cop-out and made Hel\'s entire involvement useless until it was convenient for the story.Overall, House of Flame and Shadow was an okay conclusion to the Crescent City series. I enjoyed how everything came full circle and how SJM scratches the surface of the multiverse. Sarah J. Maas is still one of my favorite authors, and even though this may not have been my favorite book, I respect the hell out of her and admire her. She\'s created some of the most magical worlds and stories that have changed a generation of readers, so she\'ll always hold a special place in my heart. I am excited for the next ACOTAR book, but I do hope she does what she does best and gives us a story with the perfect combination of a compelling plot, character growth, and romance. And for the love of god please don’t let it have more than 2 POVs.Favorite Quotes:“You’re as much of a monster as they are.”“Love will do that to you.”_______For Bryce, home was - and always would be - Hunt._______“You’re a prince, start acting like one.”_______“I don’t fucking care who you are, so long as you’re mine.

Because it\'s 1 AM and tomorrow 5 of my bookish friends are coming to spend the weekend at my place, I\'m going to post some of my raw notes because I don\'t want to leave you hanging. The plan is to come back on Monday and edit these into something easier to read lol. Don\'t expect these to be in an order that makes sense. There will be loads of spelling errors, ya just gotta deal until I can edit.With that said,SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT...FuryThe fact that all we “used” was her ability to pilot a helicopter is an embarrassment. Not to mention that this series was supposed to be about female friendships. We just, do away with fury and juniper altogether in this book. Stupid. Also, Fury literally makes a scoff about how all she’s doing is playing babysitter and I was like UH YEAH. THE FUCK?JesibaThere should have been breadcrumbs. We should have seen her interact with SOMEONE who knows Appolion *ahem, Aidas* and had her trash talk him. Then we’d be like what’s her beef?Book of breathings/library of parthosbig old plot hole. Disappointing.reunion between Bryce and Huntone of the things that made me SO ANGRYYYYYY like in the moment I was walking around saying “the fuck??? Wait WHAT???” I don’t see Pete for 24 hours and I will leap into that man’s arms. You’re telling me that *mates* who’ve been tortured and never knew if they’d find their way back to one another were going to like the fucking Ocean Queen stop them from falling into each other’s arms??? You cannot tell me they shouldn’t have been sobbing together. bullshit.Lack of character dev.I was surprised by this. I expected the book to at least take place over the course of a month, not like, a week. I get we don’t tend to change as humans thaaaaat much over a week but it\'s historically been something I appreciate that in her writing and we got none of it.Silene / Princes of Hel info dumpsI could go on and on here, but in essence, it’s bloody infuriating that there were people who knew everything all along and never guided or drop-fed that info to us over the three books. “You weren’t ready” I WANTED TO THROW MY PHONE what a cop-out. Secondly, by sharing all this info all at once, the reader doesn’t get to chew on any of it, the think about what it means. We’re just hanging on for dear life trying to take it all in. It’s like someone tossing us a ball… versus having a cannon full of tennis balls shot at you all at onceGeneral messiness/she bit off more than she could chewWhen I’m over here wishing that she’d kill some characters off, just so that we could have some emotional impact AND narrow the field, we’ve got a big problem. I think about Chekov’s Gun all the time when I’m reading… the rule in writing that if you include an element, you should use it by the book’s conclusion. And she just… doesn’t. I’ve never been more convinced than I am now after HoFaS that SJM doesn’t actually have some crisp master plan. She just leaves a fuck-tonne of Chekov’s Guns lying around, and picks them up willy nilly when it sort of works in a future book. That’s why it feels so messy, plot-hole-y, and just kind of ???the (anti)climaxthe whole final fight scene was anticlimactic, it never felt like anyone was actually in danger, and legit in all caps I was fuuuuuuming about the bringing her back to life. Nah. I’m fucking sick of it. Death is there for a reason. Get rid of it and you have NO stakes. Which makes all your hard work trying to get the reader to be worried about the character’s wellbeing null and voidOther things that made me real mad:•\u2060 \u2060what was the point in the viper queen getting a private fight between Sigrid and Ithan????•\u2060 \u2060\u2060SIGRID. are you fucking kidding me all of that round and round in circles and FOR WHAT.•\u2060 \u2060\u2060Ithan choosing to try to bring Sigrid back from the dead (reaper form) instead of focusing on what’s ACTUALLY important aka THE FIGHT OF THEIR LIFE WITH THE BIG BAD?????•\u2060 \u2060\u2060Bryce opening the coffin. why she acting like a dumb bitch? I literally wrote down: “?????

Nahhhh fuck that. They shouldn’t have ended up back together by the end of this book and we should have gotten him making ALL the amends, her fighting with herself to learn how to trust him again, etc in the next book.

TWIIIIIIIICE? He has literally winnowed just outside the wards and flown inside in a matter of seconds/like, a minute. He does it when Nesta is stuck in that nightmare in ACOSF. and TWICE we get oooooo he’s coming. look at that encroaching darkness. ooooo you better go.

I was thoroughly entertained, invested and satisfied with the way this book was written. I would say that when you go into this book,please keep in mind you're reading Bryce's story, simply put you are going in for Captain Marvel and not Avengers Endgame 🤷\u200d♀️I also see people disappointed with the way Bryce was in this book.Even though she had few moments where I felt frustrated with her, I fully understood her. In a strange environment, she is not going to or supposed to act calm. She will be paranoid. Meeting new people whom SHE doesn't know and acting suspicious, trying to escape makes ABSOLUTE sense. Even in her irrational actions, there were rational intentions 👀Coming back to the book which is divided into Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3 like any other Crescent City book.Part 1explored more folklore, history, new places and people (for Bryce) and setting up a much more powerful world building. I found myself loving it, there were some big reveals and connections. I was also shocked to see one of the creatures back in the world and it brought intense memories. It also ends on a brutal note. Iykyk.Part 2was more hands on action, it built on to the reveals made in part 1 brilliantly. I see MANY people saying that this part bored them and dragged on. On the contrary, I found it to be much more intense and mind blowing. Lidia and Ruhn carried it beautifully. Part 2 ends on a very nerve wrecking note, and you'll immediately want to binge the rest of the book.Part 3was simply put- Binge worthy. Big reveals happen here, characters in this world get what they deserve and I ate it up. Ithan and Bryce were my favorite here, and surprisingly Jesiba too. It ends on a satisfying note and I just can't wait to see how it's going to add up to the future books.Onto the characters-❤️\u200d🔥Bryce-Although a bit erratic her actions are completely justified imo. She is the same Bryce we have grown to love- smartass, funny, badass, always standing up for the right and calculating. The sacrifices she's willing to make was emotional to see. But like any other, she does have flaws and is imperfect.⚡Hunt-My man. The way he cared for Bryce was everything. Even while getting tortured to the point where he is close to death, all he cared about was Bryce and his friends. He would do anything to protect them, even if it means he's gonna end up hurt. His big reveal was one that I was never expecting and I was shook. I loved seeing him unleash and put Celestina in her place.🔥Lidia-I LOVE her. She did so much for literally everyone good in this book, such huge sacrifices. She did not put herself first once and I loved her. I swear I just want to give her the biggest hug.🖤Ruhn-Loved seeing the way he felt for Lidia. Man's had me gasping, crying, emotional for more. His bond with Hunt and Baxian was intense and so loyal. The way he was protecting Bryce was everything. Tho that one scene made me dizzy (you know which one).🐺Ithan and 🧜\u200d♂️Tharion-Although different paths, I found them to be quite similar with the way they deal with their struggles. Before anyone gets frustrated with these two- Have you ever made a mistake and in order to correct it desperately, you make more bad decisions and more mistakes?? That sounds pretty relatable to me. Not all of us are perfect. Living in self loathing, guilt, and anxiety isn't easy. Tharion and Ithan thinking that they don't deserve anything good happening to them after making so many mistakes is real and it's amental health representation at its best.So many people acting like Tharion and Ithan were annoying breaks my heart cause I found them to be so endearing and loving, so loyal, so worthy despite what the two thought. I just wish to hold them and talk to them about it all.Baxian-All I'll say is he has strong teeth 😭Jesiba and Hypaxia-I appreciated so much what these two did, especially Jesiba. Without giving too much away, am sure you'll like them more.The romances-Bryce and Hunt-Honestly, after Feyre and Rhys these two are my favorite SJM couple and they are immensely underrated. Even in their arguments, they know when to support each other. They're the couple who will support each other in public even if they are wrong and correct the other in private.Ruhn and Lidia-So angsty. It's like they broke my heart multiple times and mended it to complete perfection. Literally everything about them is PERFECT. I loved how they communicated and bared themselves to each other.Also, did SJM throw in the marriage of convenience trope? 👀Y'all gotta find out for which couple, no spoilers here. 🤭🤭I believe people have forgotten that this is Bryce's story. In order to enjoy this book, you gotta keep that in mind. I can already see that SJM has foreshadowed a lot of multiversal possible scenarios. Hopefully she'll explore them on an Endgame level someday.But for now, am excited to see where the Crescent City series will go from here 😉 I highly recommend reading this series after ToG and ESPECIALLY ACOTAR.I did not want this to end, I could still read another 500 pages of this beautiful book and world. Already can't wait to reread 😭❤•~•~IT'S FINALLY HERE 😍😍 In all it's glory 🥹🥹~•~•~Am so ready for Jan 2024""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'The weakest conclusion to an SJM series by far. This book was one big deus ex machina clusterfuck. But I think most fans will overlook the huge issues in this book because we get to see some old favourite characters.Let\'s start off with the good parts:- Lidia Cervos 🧎🏻\u200d♀️🧎🏻\u200d♀️🧎🏻\u200d♀️Few characters had any agency in this book. Lidia was one of the few people who actually made a difference in this book. She really stole the show from Bryce and Hunt.- In the same vein as Lidia, Nesta lit up every scene she was in. Every scene she was in, I only noticed her. She really carried every part of the story she touched and she is so fun.- And obviously the entire Prythian part because those characters are elite. Loved the lore drop we got.- There was a particular scene with a few characters waving at each other that broke my heart.Now on to the bad:- Welcome to the Bryce Quinlan Show, where I spent 50% of the book asking myself ""Why are Tharion/Flynn/Declan/Sathia/Hunt/Ruhn even in this scene??"". So much of this book involved Bryce and Co. going somewhere to do something. But they all could have been Bryce\'s solo missions because it literally would not have made a difference if her companions weren\'t there. I think this was made particularly evident because there were 3 or 4 times where Bryce had to relay stuff she had done in the previous chapters to her group of friends. Because her friends weren\'t doing anything. The side characters felt soooo unnecessary in so many points in this book.- Another note on Bryce, she has some smart moments in the book but so much of her dominance is because she is The Chosen One. Everything she gains is because she is related to XYZ and has ABC in her blood. It makes it really hard to root for her because she didn\'t have to earn anything.- As I already mentioned in HOSAB, Bryce is only interesting in the context of Danika. By herself, she isn\'t that particularly interesting or someone I would root for. I think the strongest part about her was her friendship to Danika. This is particularly evident when anything happens between Hunt and Bryce. They just don\'t have that much chemistry tbh. I really wish this series had been about Bryce and Danika. Hunt really felt like a side piece. I really dgaf about this man.- I can\'t believe I had to read about Hunt going commando because his d**k is too big to fit into his underwear. I actually wanted to gouge my eyes out. 🤢😵\u200d💫😵 Also Hunt and Bryce getting handsy while their friends were fighting for their lives? Why were Ruhn and Lidia trying to get it on while their friends were literally right beside them in the cave? The most unnecessary scenes that were added just so this book can be spicy.- Ithan LOLOLOL. If you look up ""filler character"" he would be the #1 offender. He actually didn\'t do anything in this book for the first 70% and then he suddenly just have everything happen to him. His rise in power was the most eye-rolling experience because he doesn\'t deserve any of this.- Tharion sorry babes I wish I had skipped every scene you were in. I actually do not give a fck about this man. Suddenly Sathia appears. What did she even add to the story? Tharion and Ithan were the two most ridiculous characters in this book. I\'m actually so mad both of them got so much ""screen time"". But Tharion might get the ""Nesta"" treatment because it is clear his story isn\'t over.- In true SJM fashion, we get the ""We could have told you all of this in Book 1 but you weren\'t ready so we are just going to explain everything now"". I\'m so sick and tired of important information being gatekept for the sake of having a plot.- I want SO MUCH MORE grovelling between Ruhn and Lidia. I wanted the angst and yearning and the hurt x comfort. They are by far the best couple in this series.- LOOOL COOPER. Why did we focus so much on Sophie and Emilie in book 2 for them to basically not matter at all.- Sigrid and Ariadne felt like loose ends. Perhaps they will be important in future books but they took up too much time in this book for them to not matter much at the end.- OK, so book 1 had that big dramatic massacre, which really got my hopes up that SJM would actually commit to some gruesome ends for some of her main characters. SYKE! I\'m so tired of none of the characters actually being in danger.- Hypaxia exists to be a deus ex machina. Her and Jesiba\'s sole purpose in the series is to get people out of a pickle. They literally didn\'t serve any other purpose.- Also where were Juniper and Fury? They were completely neglected except for one scene.- While writing this, I just remembered I haven\'t even mentioned Baxian. That just shows how insignificant he was in every scene he was in. He just gets lumped in with Hunt and Co.- The Harpy comes back for her to get KO\'d in 0.2 seconds?- Hypaxia defeats a certain character very quickly. It felt so out of left field and rushed.Overall, this book felt sloppy.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'The harder you rise, the harder you fall. Sarah J Maas wrote her own kill switch to the “Maasverse” and activated it when this was published.Disappointed does not even sum up the entirety of how I’m feeling. For those people who are really enjoying and loving this, I am so happy for you, and I wish that was the case for me. But I am just glad to have finished it so I never have to think about it again. Long live the Crescent City duology. I am envious of the characters who got to die in HOSAB/HOEAB so they didn’t have to experience HOFAS and the defamation of character that touched every single character I had previously cared about and rendered them boring, two dimensional and soulless.For a book “millions of fans” have been waiting for for two years, Sarah did not deliver. She did not even purchase a postage label. The epic conclusion to the crescent city trilogy, which had so much potential, was reduced into a messy concubine of soap opera, unwanted comedy and minimal stakes. There was so much potential. So much potential and this is what we got. I am so angry.The writing in this book leads me to believe Sarah no longer cares about Lunathion, or her characters. This book is a testament to laziness, loss of passion and the arrogance of knowing no matter what she wrote, she would be making money.Through love all is possible… yet there was no love in this book. It was rendered impossibly cold and distant from anything else she could have possibly written. Through “convenient coincidences”, all is possible, should be her new slogan.I don’t even understand how in any stage of production, anyone at bloomsbury could confidently look at this and not question the drastic changes to characters, such as Bryce’s complete tyrannical selfishness, and Hunt’s stripped down personality and so on and so on. HOFAS was a failure and nothing more.Due to my disappointment at the entire picture, I could not even bring myself to be excited when certain plot points; which I would have screamed at, were unravelled, they felt anticlimactic and convenient at best. The the potential Sarah carefully constructed in not only the last two books, but the small sprinkles of lore throughout all her books, remains completely untapped and unused. Fans and theorists could have patched together a better ending to this series and (as someone who grew distasteful of theorists and did not look forward to a crossover) I’ve seen theorists who care more and know more and understand more of Sarah’s precious worlds than she seemingly did in this book.I am so so so angry. Sarah chose convenience, palatable and cheap shock factor over writing something meaningful. I can only guess this comes from the fact that “fame” has gotten to her head. Sarah has done a disservice to long standing fans in an attempt to suck in and appeal to celebrities and influencers, blending epic backstories and well planned out history into grey palatable mush that can be consumed by the masses, instead of the quality book it could have been to be consumed by the people that make this all possible for her.Even her regular fashion of fast paced, “epic” final 100 pages could not overcome first 700 pages of convenience, low stakes nonsense. There was no slice of life, no character development, just a long endless cave of info dumping and convenience.Sarah’s best writing is a footnote in the past. Bloomsbury I am so so disappointed in you for allowing this, marketing this, profiting off this. House of Flame and Shadow is a mockery of everything good in fantasy and did not deserve our excitement, our hope, or our joy.I normally restrain myself from negative reviews, because I do believe all art is subjective and everyone has a right to enjoy art as it comes. But this was objectively bad and there are no excuses. There is no explanation. Someone as revered as Sarah J Maas should be doing better as she rises, not worse. I hope HOFAS/Sarah and the rightful people at bloomsbury receive the criticism this book deserves so that they can ensure future books do not suffer the same fate.'}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""By now I’m sure we’ve all seen the news for special editions. Everyone is excited for the Adriel, Nesta and Bryce chapter so clearly Walmart is the move right? Everyone is happy. And excited. And that’s fine and dandy.But let me ask you this.WHERE IS CASSIAN???????WHERE’S MY MAN IN ALL THIS!He wasn’t included as one of the people in the bonus chapters and no one is concerned!!Did we forget that Elain saw a vision of Cassian dying??Why are Nesta and Azriel together while Cassian isn’t there????I’m scared guys. This book isn’t out and I’m already stressed.First of all, if Hunt, Bryce, and Ruhn don't live happily ever after in this. We riot.Second, if we don't get an Avengers level team up in this book I'm suing for getting my hopes up. That ending killed and then revived me and I don't know how I'm going to wait for this.Third, get ready for some crackpot theories cause my brain is spiraling!!! I don't know anyone in real life who has read this book, or who is just as excited about any of this as I am, so I have no one to scream these at. Instead, I'll scream them at you all!- Rhys' last name is Danaan?????- Either that or Ruhn isn't actually the son of Autumn King since he's clearly a descendant from the Night Court (Bryce literally thought Rhys was Ruhn so clearly there's a blood relation, But like the Autumn king is clearly from the Autumn court???? pls give me theories!)- Azriel has major ties to fey in Lunathion since he had Truth Teller and was the one that casually found Bryce. I no longer believe in coincidence. Everything is suspicious. If the whole ACOTAR gang can't cross to Bryce's world, I think only Az might. (The starborn sword and his knife have to fight together.- Fury and Amren are related or have similar powers or are of the same species (they basically act the same and no one knows what Fury can actually do). Are they one of the Asteri's creations??? Like how the Asteri made the angels and mentioned creating prototypes for the angels in the previous world which I assume is what the Illyrians are????? Where Amren and Fury creations of theirs in another world??-Hunt is part Thunderbird (We're told that he was literally bred for something and his father is a mystery) Like clearly one of the princes is his father, but like, the guy can literally absorb and use energy which is pretty thunderbird-ish.- Hunt is going to literally just suck the energy out of the Asteri and that's how he'll kill them. (I kept thinking that's what the thunderbird was going to do and then that went nowhere).-Cormac isn't dead. (I've decided that I like him and so he can't die.)- Cormac's side of the family might be related to Aelin and her world.- The shifters obviously come from Aelin's world and the wolves are lowkey related Fenrys????- I don't think Aelin will make much of an appearance. (the girl is tired, she went through too much let her rest!)- If Aelin does show up, it'll be brief. (As I said, she's tired, she's not here to fight) But if she does, I really just want her, Bryce and Cassian to interact because the chaos and badassery they would bring would be unmatched.- Ruhn and Lidia are obviously mates. Because duh. (Also, I totally called her being Agent Daybright. I knew right from chapter one that Lidia would be a good guy when she threw Sofie into the water.) But anyway, she might have some connection to Aelin???? I just get a vibe from her.Feel free to tell me I'm crazy. At this point, I'm grasping at straws and I know it.""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Erm, it’s no from me.I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again:Sarah J. Maasownsmy ass.I don’t feel this level of obsession for any other author.But this book? Was a shit show. I’m so glad it’s over. 😓I don’t even had it in me to be sad about this. I just wanna hate. Respectfully.✨Incoming rant review! ✨NO spoilers. Just a general overview.The first half had me captivated. I loved being back with these characters, discovering the world and the lore. Things were exciting!But, the second half lost me completely. The amount of running plot points we had started to read scattered instead of it coming together.Bryce, honey? You can suck my dick.🙂Her character arc was so messy, it made no damn sense! 😑The development was not there. Instead of growing into her power, her knowledge with wisdom, with the support of others that are much more skilled and smarter than she is, that understand the political nuance of the world better than she does, she chose to act like a spoiled, entitled brat, had the nerve to call herself a leader, yet was acting on her own accord all the time.She was running on arrogance and recklessness. She read stupid. She became the ‘alphahole’ she kept complaining about.I don’t understand why this was the direction her character went in. I don’t know what SJM or her editors were thinking. Or am I not understanding things correctly?No, I’m not the problem here.Bryce ruined it.She read like a bootleg version of Aelinand it was embarrassing to read. 🙄At some point, I had enough of the world-building too. A lot of information was being revealed and it was not smoothly laid out or explored. It just kept being piled on top of one another and I got bored. I don’t want to be reading pages of it.The crossover was another thing that was so poorly and boringly told. If you’re going to have a crossover, do it right. Incorporate the worlds together, because otherwise, why introduce it in the first place? The potential this aspect of the story had was squandered and fucked with. 😑Whilst I’m a fan of multiple POV’s, the constant switches here were making me dizzy. 🥴We had multiple perspectives within the SAME chapter. The paragraphs were too short. There was no time given to truly connect to their POV and immersive oneself in their struggles before we swiftly moved on to the next POV. I wish chapters were dedicated to them instead.This is by far my least favourite novel from SJM and now my least favourite series.This is not the SJM I’ve come to know and love. The one that creates found families like no other, romances like no other, mental health and trauma representation like no other with far tighter plots.I wasn’t expecting for my feelings to go in this direction. This was underwhelming and such a disappointment. I’m holding out hope that whenever the next book releases and I reread this*shudders*I’ll like it more? 😬I need ice cream.

I applaud her (yet again) for her ability to weave so many threads, characters and mythology into one insanely action packed tale.SPOILERS BELOW...I'm going to start with Bryce. I adore her. I feel like the theme of this book was ‘Level Up’, and she did this and then some. After all of the shit she went through in the previous books I loved see her step fully into her own.I’ve seen a few reviews criticising her character as being ‘insufferable’, which I find kind of interesting … mostly for the fact that when we judge something, it’s most often the thing that we don’t give ourselves permission to be or feel, or are judging within ourselves. As a collective, women have been taught to fear our own power, and here we’re presented with a fully fleshed, whole person that doesn’t feel the need to humble herself or shrink to make herself more relatable to others. Given the above, I get this can be polarising for some people who identify as female… but for me? I freaking LOVED this. The scene in particular between her and the two fae kings was so cathartic. SJM was really channelling some feminine rage and putting a metaphoric foot down against the patriarchy. Honestly, the amount of times I wish I’d been in a position to fight back like this… it was so wonderful to read.Bryce’s character arc across all three books felt right to me. The bit of tension between her and Hunt also felt valid - I could see things from both their sides and it felt true to their characters. Ultimately, Bryce was carrying the sole weight of being the key to destroying the Asteri, and her mental fortitude (while maybe it came across as being too headstrong at times) was needed in order for her to carry this out. Sorry not sorry.Onto Hunt - bless him, he really went through it in this book. I also thoroughly enjoyed his ‘Level Up’ towards the end. The romantic tension between he and Bryce was definitely higher in books 1 & 2 - here they were more in the ‘marriage phase’ of being a couple, which I guess is fine… although I wish we’d had a little bit more of a dramatic reunion / spice. Overall Hunt has always been a solid character in my mind.Lidia & Ruhn… I LOVE. They carried the romance in this book. Lidia was an incredible personality to work into the mix - she kind of reminds me a bit of Manon in that she’s not the FMC, but easily could be.Ithan - his scene with Connor had me sobbing. I had secretly hoped he’d end up as the Prime!Nesta - I’ve never been a massive fan of hers, but I was surprised by how much I enjoyed her in this book!. All of the snark and banter between her and Bryce was fantastic.Azriel - honestly, I’ve never gotten much from Az, and this book was no different. I think people project onto his personality (which is very quiet) and build stories about him in their own minds, because in reality we know very little about him, and he doesn't really speak that often. That being said, I loved the sweet moment between him and Nesta when he convinced her to take off the mask - it did mushy things to my heart.THE ENDINGI have no words except… what in the holy Interstellar!!? SJM can sure write a mind blowing action scene. So. Freaking. Amazing.THE ACOTAR CROSSOVERFor the most part, I was OK with how this panned out. There was always going to be a fine line between this remaining a Crescent City book vs turning into an ACOTAR take over.I think I would have liked just a **smidge** more from the interactions between Bryce and the gang - particularly with Rhys, Cassian and Feyre (who did not make an appearance at all.) It honestly felt like a Nesta x Crescent City crossover in the end, but I’m not mad about it. I am glad SJM stuck with the Crescent City POVs and that it stayed firmly a CC book.Furthermore, now that she has opened the connection between the two worlds, it leaves room for CC characters to cameo in future ACOTAR books which I wouldn’t object to in the slightest. And with the Starsword now back in Velaris… I’m sure it will come into play in future books.Side note: Randall & Ember’s bonus chapter - IDK why, but she continues to portray Rhys as an overbearing asshole? I just want the Rhys we know and love back.THE NEXT CRESCENT CITY BOOKI’d guess it will be a continuation of Tharion’s story. His journey in this book, was, essentially a retelling of The Little Mermaid - it would make sense for the next book given House of Many Waters is the remaining title. I think SJM put Tharion through the ringer in this book to lay the groundwork for a lot of character growth and redemption should his story continue. Maybe he and Ariadne are going to wind up together??Ithan's romance was also hinted at with Perry, but again there's a wide open space there so that's also another possibility.TO SUM UPI'm really sad this series is over, I've loved every second of it. <3""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Part One: The DropRuhn is pretty pissed at his girlfriend and our winged boys (feathers not leathers) aren’t doing great. Bryce is in a dungeon with a weirdly polite Rhys and friends but not the High Lady which seems not very “we are equals”-y. I had to Google Flynn because I could not remember who he was to save my life. Tharion is now a drug-addicted UFC fighter which I’ll call a step backwards. I have no idea where Syrinx is and this is very distressing. Nesta keeps being referred to as a warrior even though we all know that the biggest foe she’s ever faced is Cassian’s dick. Bryce’s Boob Star acts as MapQuest and Ithan accidentally kills someone he’s known for three days. Bryce finds out she hails from hella colonizers and then wakes up a haughty old bitch. Homeward bound! Azriel is apparently now the Nesta Whisperer?Part Two: The SearchBryce teleports into her dad’s office and he is a predictable dick about it. Ruhn, who asks to have his hand chewed off, is rescued alongside Hunt and Baxian and I cried. Lidia dies but this is a Sarah J. Maas book so she also un-dies. Ithan gets a job as an executive assistant in exchange for reanimating a corpse. Ruhn discovers that Lidia has little fawns and Hunt and Bryce reunite in a really unsatisfying way. You’ve heard of the Avatar, the master of all elements, now meet Hypaxia: The Fendyr-Bender. Bryce and the gang go treasure hunting on the island from MYST. There are many hieroglyphics and Hunt is a huge bitch while in Hel where he meets his dads. Ruhn kills their father (Vanserra boys take note), then Bryce sticks her sword in the floor of a cave and the land heals itself like the end of The Lion King.Part Three: The AscentSyrinx is with Bryce’s parents so everybody (me) can relax. The Asteri blew up a town square and killed a lot of people so Bryce decides to rip a hole in the space time continuum to get rid of them; perhaps they can be lured by a line of treats on the ground. Nesta just hands over her death Mask, which is totally like her and completely in-character. Bryce makes major decisions regarding other people without consulting them and isn’t sorry because deez nuts. Hunt decides he’s tired of his slave halo and just gets rid of it, I guess. Lidia is apparently Aelin’s granddaughter or something. Bryce sucks all the baddies into a void and then dies and comes back because SJM cannot stop writing anticlimactic endings. Nesta gets a nice hug. What happened to Tharion and his wife and the dragon and the dead alpha and the Viper Queen? What great questions that have no answers.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""1.)House of Earth and Blood★★★2.)House of Sky and Breath★★★♡ all 5 HOFAS bonus chapters:tumblr+redditthis was a reading experience, friends! after my content and trigger warnings, i will do a spoiler section of my thoughts because at this point in the sjm universe / maasverse, and this being the third book in the crescent city series, it is difficult to talk about anything without it being a potential spoiler!i had a good time reading this. I really loved lidia and ruhn’s storylines and they really made the entire book for me. I am also still so very in love with hypaxia, and the things i would do to get her pov. speaking of, I felt a little bored at some povs in hofas - mostly ithian and tharion (i am so sorry to these men, i love them and feel so much empathy for them, but it is true). and bryce’s pov made me feel a range of emotions, that’s for sure, but most of the time it wasn’t the best emotions. ultimately, i think there were too many povs in this book and sometimes the switching between them felt very jarring and unbalanced. i also feel like there was just so much going on, which valid, but instead of it being information that we started to learn in the first two books, it felt like sjm was kind of just throwing out every plot she could think up. and i think this all made the pacing of this book a bit weird feeling. but i did love that baldur’s gate unexpected cursed dot storyline a lot.like all sjm books, this could have been edited down a little bit (or a lot a bit). But i think what all sjm’s books do exceptionally well is discussion of trauma and grief and learning to live coinciding with those two very heavy things and also trying to heal from them, and how those healing paths can look very different for everyone. I feel like we can really see that in her crescent city series and it is always something that i will appreciate her putting out into the world.overall, i had a lot of fun reading this and making connections between all the things. if you follow my reviews, you will know how much i love theorycrafting and connecting different universes together, and this book truly took this experience to a different level. each easter egg truly felt like a long awaited gift i was finally able to open. and once i finished this last page, well… and all the bonus chapters, the anticipation i felt for whatever sjm does next was very surprising and a little unmatched. plus reading a new sjm book when it drops, with what feels like half of the online book community, feels special each and every new release.trigger + content warnings:death, grief, blood, captivity, slavery, extreme torture, a lot of violence, gun violence, maybe cannibalism / maybe just a lot of gore, battle, war, loss of a loved one in past (and a lot of talk about it), loss of sibling in past, defecation and urine mentions, self harm to get blood, sexual abuse, threat of rape, talk of forced breeding, talk of medical experimentation, talk of domestic abuse, talk of parental abuse, colonization, needles, bombings, a lot of talk and mentions of hurt children, vomit, a lot of talk of parasites, drugging / poisoning, self sacrifice / a lot of attempts at self sacrificingthis next section of this review will be filled with spoilers!please use caution!and please make sure you’ve read the entire throne of glass series and the entire a court of thorns and roses series!us finally getting the throne of glass crossover moment we have all been waiting for? I was truly screaming. lidia cervos, the woman you are. the stag throne, the hidden flame powers, the ruby ring, the blatant descendant name drop of whitethorn galathynius. i am still losing my mind while i type this. obviously bryce and ruhn being somehow related to rhysand is pretty cool. and i truly believe Ithan is a descendant of dorian because of the ice powers (and by the end of tog dorian was a shifter). but lidia being related to aelin? i am just speechless.lidia was the best character in this book for me, too. And she had the most heartfelt and empowering story going on throughout as well. and the naming of her one son brannon? truly, her and ruhn really were the stars of this third book and their povs were hands down my favorite. (that target bonus chapter? so good)okay more throne of glass crossover screaming - the under king! full credit toemmahalbrook on tiktok!but my jaw is still on the floor. i am just so excited to read reviews and find more crossovers that i missed, and to see all the crossover content that is still to come!my mind is still trying to process everything with theia and aidas (and helena and silene). i know rhysand is a descendant of theia and amren told him she was a prisoner of theia. But this book kind of makes it appear like amren was a captured “pet monster” of silene. i need to do more research but amren connecting all the gods and theia is really cool and something i think the fandom has been wanting more confirmation of for a really long time.okay back to crescent city, hypaxia was amazing, as always! i just love my sapphic necromancer queen. i know i made the baldur's gate joke above, but wizards of the coast are quaking at her finding the antidote to defeat the parasites and still finding ways to make it more easily accessible and forever lasting. she is actually the real mvp of this book.ruhn, hunt, and baxian going through some dark stuff and making jokes to keep light getting out of that dungeon. I actually really loved seeing their friendship in this book, even if… again, some dark stuff.i don’t want to talk about this, but ultimately i know i need to because i feel like this is the reason i am giving this book three stars, so let’s talk about it - bryce wasn’t my favorite in this book, sadly. her leaving cooper was just so cruel to me. i know many other reviewers are saying this, but bryce did so many things that made readers question that maybe she is turning into the villain (which might have been a little cool actually). but her leaving him behind was just wild to me. ember and randall showing they are upset because of this and voicing that bryce was wrong for leaving him still (or maybe even enhanced) made me so upset at her. But there were so many other instances too, like when she called lidia’s kids baggage? like when she told hunt to get over himself when the man was really going through it in those dungeons? what was all that? she felt so reckless and so careless and even heartless. ahhh i dont know, i just feel like bryce is easily my least favorite of sjm’s main characters, and i just liked her less and less each book, which feels so bad to say, but it really is how i feel.this is so random, but i also need to admit that i truly didn’t think cormac was dead dead, so i was so surprised when this book wrapped up and i guess that man really is! man oh man, i was truly waiting for that reveal and it just never came!okay, the ending! i loved seeing those three fire sprites truly saving the day. and them working at griffin antiquities at the end? oh, i really loved to see it. i shed many tears at jesiba actually saving the day, and i shed even more at bryce seeing danika and connor and everyone she loves waiting for her. and i did actually like the blackhole portal teleporting as well. the last 100 pages of this book were very strong and very heartfelt.and the very end? the way i truly wept at bryce's mom hugging and saying kind words to nesta. I actually felt insane with swollen eyes because of it. (the bam bonus chapter was probably my favorite of all the bonus chapters though. also, i just really want to live in the house of wind!) But yeah, i felt like this was a very strong ending to this book, and a very strong set up for whatever sjm does next! (probably with acotar now that nesta has the sword, dagger, mask, and a harp to potentially find bryce or whoever else whewwwww)lastly, because i cannot write a spoiler section review and not bring this up: when azriel said nyx is waiting too. oh, it got a tear from me. and bryce telling nesta and azriel how a phone works got a giggle from me. i truly cannot wait for whatever sjm gives us next.the acotar reread really came in clutch, especiallyacosf! But this whole reading experience just made me really want to reread tog asap! especially because (i can’t believe i am typing this) i think nesta is really making it hard for me to say that manon is my favorite sjm character!blog|instagram|youtube|kofi|spotify|amazon1.)Throne of Glass★★1.)A Court of Thorns and Roses★★★★2.)A Court of Mist and Fury★★★3.)A Court of Wings and Ruin★★★3.1)A Court of Frost and Starlight★★★4)A \u200bCourt of Silver Flames★★★★""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'SJM??????Byrce ruined this whole book for me..I feel like SJM just wanted to throw in everything in one book and hoped for the best.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""I FINISHED….IT’S DONE.I will never recover from this series.

Despite my mixed feelings, I was completely engrossed the whole time and enjoyed it. It genuinely makes it hard to rate the book 🫠 I’m leaning towards 3.5 stars. It's not to say it was a bad book; it’s just not what I thought it’d be, and it gave acompletely differentvibe to CC1&2.Spoilers ahead!!-----The book is extremely plot driven, and I loved learning about the universe’s lore! I don’t think I’ll ever wrap my head around everything revealed. How Sarah can think up these ideas and craft such intricate worlds, I have no idea!🤯Part 1 was intense!The crossover was amazing. I appreciated how the book remained a Crescent City book and wasn’t wholly overpowered by the crossover. However, I didn’t like that too much was revealed all at once, too quickly, and mainly through direct dialogue. It would have been better if Bryce had discovered things on her own instead of being told straight up. It was almost a little too convenient. It set the tone for the rest of the discoveries as well. Nothing was played out entirely to its full potential.The lore was amazing, there’s no denying that, but the execution of it could have been better. It felt flat and almost like a tick box exercise, unlike Sarah’s usual style. With the number of things that were revealed, it might have been better to split this into two books as it sometimes felt rushed. I can’t get over the fact that this entire book's timeline wasONE WEEK!If it could have been spread further, it would have worked so much better, and that way, it would have addressed the lack of depth.My main dislike of the book was the completelack of emotional connection. All the characters lost the usual flair they had in CC1&2. It was as if they all lost their personalities. And maybe that’s with it being plot driven, but something just felt off with them all, and there was a sort of emptiness to them. It’s the complete opposite of CC1&2. Those books had me sobbing, but with this one, I didn’t find it anywhere near as emotional as I thought it would be or what it attempted to be. My issues with this started to present during part 2, with the reunion of all the characters.It was so underwhelming.We know Sarah likes her POV switch ups, and I usually don’t mind it in any of her books, but something was off here. The switches were abrupt and often within the same chapter, so any emotional development happening instantly fell short, and I struggled to immerse myself. Not to be picky, but there were many grammatical errors, too. I found many missing quotation marks, which just ended up disrupting the flow even further, as I was like'wait, when did the dialogue start?'On the other hand, I didn’t find myself getting bored in anyone’s storyline since it was extremely fast paced. It was hard to find a good point to put it down as the plot and the story just never stopped!Bryce frustrated me so much!She almost felt like a completely different character, and her character arc was extremely messy and frankly made no sense. She was acting as if she knew everything and was so unserious. Thankfully, part 3 is where she starts to return to her usual self, and by the end of the book, I was thinking'there’s the Bryce I know and love'. But the arc she went on to get to that point was bizarre.Bryce and Hunt’s relationship is part of what made me love CC so much, but their relationship in this book was flat. It lacked the chemistry, banter, and warmth they usually had. Sarah, why on earth did you have them arguing after their reunion!?!?!? Why were they constantly at odds with each other? I thought they had resolved their trust issues in CC2, so I did not like the angst between them at all. I get that they’re portrayed as a real couple, but I’m sad at how it played out 😭 They just needed to talk to each other and explain their feelings, but it was instantly shut down whenever they tried. That was primarily due to Bryce - I don’t understand why she acted as she did towards Hunt; she constantly dismissed his feelings. And again, the abrupt POV changes did not help. I’m glad they returned to normal in part 3, and I’m happy I got the bonus chapters between them to end it on a good note.Ruhn and Lidia were certainly a highlight!! There were loads of reveals about Lidia, which were completely unexpected. It made me love her even more. I must admit their relationship development felt awkwardly paced to me, though, which is such a shame because their romance journey could have been so much more beautiful 😭Surprisingly, I enjoyed Tharion’s and Ithan’s chapters. They added a nice reprieve from the intensity and added some value to the journey towards the end.Part 3 saved the book for meand was the only part where I felt somewhat emotional, even though the ending was pretty convenient. At no point did I even fear for any character, as it just didn’t feel high stakes enough. Shahar’s appearance was such a lovely surprise. I loved the reveal of Brann’s name.

",Gabrielle Zevin,4.14,1083674,5556,"Fiction, Contemporary, Romance, Audiobook, Literary Fiction, Adult, Historical Fiction",401,05-07-2022,"In this exhilarating novel, two friends—often in love, but never lovers—come together as creative partners in the world of video game design, where success brings them fame, joy, tragedy, duplicity, and, ultimately, a kind of immortality.On a bitter-cold day, in the December of his junior year at Harvard, Sam Masur exits a subway car and sees, amid the hordes of people waiting on the platform, Sadie Green. He calls her name. For a moment, she pretends she hasn't heard him, but then, she turns, and a game begins: a legendary collaboration that will launch them to stardom. These friends, intimates since childhood, borrow money, beg favors, and, before even graduating college, they have created their first blockbuster,Ichigo. Overnight, the world is theirs. Not even twenty-five years old, Sam and Sadie are brilliant, successful, and rich, but these qualities won't protect them from their own creative ambitions or the betrayals of their hearts.Spanning thirty years, from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Venice Beach, California, and lands in between and far beyond, Gabrielle Zevin'sTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrowis a dazzling and intricately imagined novel that examines the multifarious nature of identity, disability, failure, the redemptive possibilities in play, and above all, our need to connect: to be loved and to love. Yes, it is a love story, but it is not one you have read before.","[{'rating': 4, 'content': 'This is one of those well-lauded books that I felt a bit hesitant going in. I assumed it was targeted for a certain audience—either those who gravitate towards stories about complicated friendships, or gamers. I\'m not sure either of those are me, so what would I get out of it?And when I first started, I thought for sure I\'d made a mistake. The first chapter was so overwritten, coming across as both pretentious and off-putting, and I cringed my way through it. I thought to myself, this is it. The book that everyone loves, I\'d either have to give up on or end up writing a lowly-rated review and be subjected to comments about brain deficiency.I took a break and then decided to give it another chance. Chapter 2 was a little bit better. And then we come to Chapter 3, and bam! I was hooked. It\'s not an understatement to say that the scene with Dov teaching the Advanced Games seminar class was my favorite of the whole book and it\'s what sold me on reading it.From then on, every moment related to designing or making video games, I was totally there for. Before I started, if you\'d told me that that would be the part I\'d enjoy the most, I would\'ve been surprised. I wouldn\'t categorize myself as a gamer since I\'ve probably only loved one video game my whole life. (That wasAnimal Crossing, first on the GameCube and then almost 20 years later asAnimal Crossing: New Horizonson the Switch.)But then when I think about it, I shouldn\'t have been surprised. The way this book talks about games, they\'re really presented as more like stories, albeit ones where the reader can participate in and influence the direction and outcome. And I\'m certainly a reader of the most passionate sort.I\'m also a software engineer with a little bit of experience making video games on the side, so of course the technical aspects of Sam and Sadie\'s ventures totally appealed to me. Reading about their projects is more or less like reading about work—which I normally avoid like the plague—but somehow this book made it exciting.I can\'t help but wish the games were real. I want to play them and capture the feelings reading about them evoked in me. And I also want to know everything that went into making them. If this were a biography on a real video game company, I would\'ve loved it from cover to cover and completely gobbled it up.But it wasn\'t, and as a result, this wasn\'t a perfect story for me. It very much centers around Sam and Sadie\'s friendship, and that was pretty much the weakest part. I didn\'t really connect with either of the characters. All their issues were the result of the dreaded miscommunication trope, where one or the other refuses to say what they mean, leading to misunderstandings. And this went on and on, through many years.My other issue with the story is that it includes a certain development that comes out of nowhere, seemingly for no other reason than to beat down the characters, thus eliciting tugs of the heartstrings and upping the emotional ante. And I\'m just not a fan. It doesn\'t add anything to the story and it left me feeling somewhat emotionally manipulated.I also have to point out that the story at times feels like it\'s a bit too clever with its verbiage. Like at one point, this book conjured up the only two literary characters who know what ""jejune"" means and put them in a conversation with each other. While that\'s an impressive use of the thesaurus, it detracts a bit from the story being told.But I don\'t think my experience with the book is typical. A lot of other readers praise the depiction of Sam and Sadie\'s relationship and declare their love for the book despite the video game segments. I\'m pretty much the complete opposite. But even coming from two different directions, it seems we have all reached the same conclusion, and that\'s our collective enjoyment for this supremely interesting story. And in the end, that\'s all that really matters.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

I would have if the beginning hadn’t been so beautifully done. There’s a line in the book about a video game sequel being awful because it was farmed out to Indian programmers who had no interest in the game and that’s how this book feels after the incredible start. The beginning was layered, nuanced and artfully done. I hate flashbacks but this book had managed to layer the present, past and future in such an incredible way before it fell off a cliff and suddenly feels like an entirely different writer took over.The story began with Sadie and Sam central to the story. We found out about them in a narrative that skipped around in time to let us understand them and their relationship. Sam was the obviously the more sympathetic of the two and the one you as a reader care about. Sadie was often annoying and then fell apart in a ridiculous way. I hoped her awful college self with the horrible college boyfriend would evolve and grow up but she never does. Even worse for the story is the tangents that from that point became the story. We suddenly get a new character who is rightly called boring later on. He is a NPC. He’s just too good and uninteresting to take up so much space. We get his backstory we don’t need. In a similar way later on we get two new characters that happen to be gay that bring nothing to the story other than a celebration of their sexuality which apparently is worth their inclusion. Much like tangents about their game that take up unnecessary page time and continue to dilute any attempt at storytelling. There’s plenty of politics, even to a ridiculously degree like actual comical bad guys intent on violence against those in favor of gay relationships and marriage. Ironically for a book full of wokeness with characters never being straight, celebrating gender fluidity, the book managed to ridicule cultural appropriation. The book is very focused on the race of the characters but never explores them in more than a superficial way.One of the author’s worst faults was her pretentious word choices. Instead of writing in way that flowed she chose to constantly check her thesaurus for jarring words like jejune and verdigris every couple of pages. Ironically much like the criticism of a game her character created this book is pretentious and full of itself. The worst part is that could have been amazing if it had stayed as focused as it was in the beginning. This is not a story worth the journey so do not push play. I received a complimentary copy of this book. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow I will still be thinking about this brilliant book.Fair warning that I am predisposed to adore coming-of-age novels about protagonists of my generation (Gen X), apparently even if I don’t have much in common with them other than birth year. In this case, the protagonists are Sadie and Sam, two friends whose lives intertwine up, down, and around their love of gaming.It must be said that this book is VERY MUCH about video games. Sadie and Sam play them, talk about them, design them, and promote them over the span of thirty years. What a testament to author Gabrielle Zevin’s writing that I could be glued to the pages of a story about a topic that typically bores me to tears! Because I loved Sadie and Sam so much, I never lost interest in their worlds - either the real one of their day-to-day existence or the virtual ones they were building.They are, without a doubt in my mind, the two characters I’ve cared about the most over the past decade of my reading life.I do say that with a bit of trepidation, as I know some readers of this review who love me (shout out to my mom again!) will want to read Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow to meet my new literary best friends. I must therefore point out that while the novel is a masterpiece in my eyes, some people are not going to be able to get through it. Zevin is a fan of obscure words, there are risky techniques used (such as an occasional second-person chapter and dropping readers into a video game world), sad and unsavory things happen in the plot, and the text is fairly dense. This is a long 416 pages.Also, having read (and enjoyed) Zevin’s previous two novels, The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry and Young Jane Young, this feels like it’s from an entirely different author. I breezed through those others in a day, but Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow took me a week. I know that’s because I savored every word and often reread entire paragraphs, but that’s my point. If her prior books were hamburgers, this one is a steak.I feel a bit bad for the upcoming books I’ll be reading in the wake of this novel, since I know nothing will compare for a very long time. In case it’s not clear enough already, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow has a well-earned place on my all-time favorites shelf. When you finish the final page of a book and hug it to your chest, where else would it go?My sincere thanks to the author and Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group for the gifted review copy via NetGalley.

Because, as the blurb stated, this was essentially a book about two good friends making a video game together.But was it?Not gonna lie, I wasn't sure where I would land on this when I decided to pick up late via BOTM add-on. (See, I even skipped over it when it was one of the monthly picks).Despite being a child of the 80's and 90's, I never played videogames. I know, I know...the horror, some of you might be thinking. But, whelp, my dad was adamantly against us playing them, convinced it would make us lazy and turn our minds into mush.Well, while I can't say that I'mnotlazy or that my mindisn'tmush despite never being a gamer, Icansay that, based on the one or two times I played it at a friends' house, Ireallysucked atMario Kartanyway.But I digress.Like I said, never having been a gamer, I was worried about how that might play into my enjoyment of a book which, on the surface, was centered around video games.But again...was it really?Yes and no.This was about so much more than video games, folks. So much more than standard friendship. I can't even explain what I mean here...It just encapsulated so much of the human experience in such a bold, yet nuanced way.In today's western culture--which is seemingly insistent uponeverythinghaving to be a social justice/political statement that slams you over the head on exhausting repeat--the way this book handled said topics felt...organic.Showing not telling.Allowing me toabsorbthe message instead of simply beating me over the head with self-righteousness.So refreshing.Also, there are so many elements of the book that felt personal to me...that struck a chord with me. I won't get into them; but, suffice to say that, again, this book was very much about the human experience. And the way the author used video games as a platform for it all was super creative. And super well executed, in my opinion.Originally, I rated this 4.5 instead of 5 stars; however, I've thought about this book a lot since finishing it several days ago. And anything that makes me self-reflect...that moves me enough to contemplate the facets of it days later...deserves the full five.P.S. You don't need to be a gamer to love this book.P.P.S. You do need to love Marx.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Complicated and MemorableTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow,is a multilayered novel about friendship, love, and video games.Sam and Sadie met when they are kids and quickly bonded over their love of video games. They develop a friendship that spans almost 30 years. The novel follows the highs and lows of their friendship, including falling in love, falling out, a love triangle, successes, and failures. Throughout it all, the one constant in their lives is video games.The narrative alternates primarily between Sadie and Sam's POVs.Sam and Sadie are both loveable, arrogant, infuriating, and flawed.The dynamics of their friendship are complicated by love, jealousy, and misunderstanding. I got a little sick of the friends to frenemies cycle between Sadie and Sam (more of Sadie’s anger towards Sam, but I understood her point of view).I loved them, but I also wanted to shake some sense in them.Sam’s mother, Anna; Marx, Sam’s college roommate; Dov, Sadie's professor; are some additional characters who make an impact.My favorite characters were Sam’s grandparents, Dong Hyun and Bong Cha.The novel blends reality and game worlds, and parts of the narrative take place in a virtual open world.All characters are well-developed and multidimensional. Even the avatars are multidimensional.I am not a huge fan of video games, but this book made me nostalgic for the video games of my childhood.I got all of the Oregon Trail and Mario references, but there were times that I was a little lost, but I didn’t mind because I learned so much about gaming.The reader doesn’t need to know much about video games to enjoy this book (but it might help!).There are also a lot of 80s, 90s, and early 2000s pop culture references mixed in. I loved reading the details behind creating a game and the gaming industry as I was introduced to a whole new world.This is a well-written, complex, thought-provoking, and original novel. I was invested in the characters, and some moments hit me on an emotional level. I got teary-eyed towards the end. I won't forget these characters; this is a book that is going to stay with me for a long time.I received an ARC of this book from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I feel... really disappointed by this. I\'ve loved Zevin\'s books in the past and I was lured in by some of the early starred reviews that promised I would be enchanted by this book. I can see the many interesting themes the author is juggling here and have highlighted a few passages I thought were noteworthy, yet a few moments of brilliance just couldn\'t make this book any less tedious for me.The story is essentially about gamers and video games, throwing up constant references to the history of gaming and gaming culture. The two main characters, Sadie and Sam, bond over playing video games when the pair meet in the children\'s ward of a hospital and later conceive of, and program, games of their own. Their own personal stories-- involving family, friends, sexism in the industry and abusive relationships (contains emotional manipulation and sexual assault) play out alongside this.I will confess that maybe it is just my disinterest in the world of gaming that drives my apathy towards this story. I have played my fair share of certain games-- caught them all in Pokemon, explored the worlds of Final Fantasy VII onwards, built a fabulous neighbourhood in Sims, employed some questionable antics in Grand Theft Auto and, to a lesser extent, tried my hand at Tomb Raider, Resident Evil and The Last of Us.That being said, I do not consider ""gamer"" to be a defining term for me. I would always rather read. And my interest in games does not extend beyond the games to the culture surrounding it.Kirkus assured me that even those who ""have never played a video game in their lives"" will love this book, but I feel like that probably isn\'t true. I found it a struggle just to make it through and I kept finding excuses to check my email, google something random that occurred to me, or just do household chores instead of reading this.Some people have commented on it being a long book, but 400 pages isn\'t all that long. It feels much longer.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Obviously, I'm in the minority here, but I wasn't particularly enthralled.A lack of concentration plagues Tomorrow, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, a novel I found to be lacking. The narrative jumps from the present to various points in the past without providing the reader with an opportunity to get emotionally invested in any of the protagonists, except maybe Marx.In general, the overall writing was pleasant. Particularly interesting to me was the genuineness of the content concerning game design and production.Unfortunately, as someone who has spent a large portion of their adult life working in the gaming industry, I found the protagonists' talks of game design and development outside the scope of their debut game Ichigo to be tedious.The story was dull and I found the author's constant urge to stay\xa0woke\xa0to be obnoxious. While I respect her intention to raise awareness about pressing social concerns, I found that her preachiness frequently derailed the narrative and detracted from the plot. I find it fascinating when authors of fiction skillfully weave explorations of societal concerns into the fabric of their narratives. Unfortunately, in my opinion, Zenin did not carry out this action.Finally, while the first half of the book is interesting and well written, the second half falls apart under the weight of its own ambitions.Should you still read it? Probably based on all the other reviews.Rating: 3Follow me on Instagram!""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""My thoughts before finding out about Zevin's plagiarism and Zionism: I understand the hype. The book is well-written with a lot of heart. From the moment the characters meet in chapter 2, I loved their friendship. I especially enjoyed seeing their creative process in making video games and the level of thought put into storytelling and quality of work. This is something that would appeal to any creative person, regardless if you're a video game designer or not. I was not a fan of certain romantic developments, since they were unnecessary and felt like an easy way to create drama, but still very solid overall.My thoughts now: I'm disappointed that Zevin didn't give credit to Brenda Romero's undistributed game, 'Train,' when she gave credit to plenty of other game creators in her acknowledgements. It wouldn't have been difficult to simply add another name, and crediting wouldn't have detracted from the story either. It's sadly ironic that for a story about women being underrepresented and overlooked in the gaming industry, the author would do the same to Romero. Doubly disappointing is Zevin's ties to Hadassah, a US-based Zionist women's organization. I'd hoped that the mention of Israel in the book was because Zevin wanted to add more flaws to her antagonist character, but it appears that she shares the same beliefs.

Zevin\'s descriptions of the process, so technical, transport the reader into an imaginary world so vast that at one point, i saw myself in the game sam and sadie made. additionally, i salute the author\'s courage to include difficult literary techniques (e.g.: second-person pov) in an already intricate setting.ultimately, the brilliance of this book comes from its characters. i don\'t think i have cared for characters this deeply sinceAlone With You in the Ether. sam, sadie, and marx are written with depth and empathy. they evolve like real people would, for better and worse. their humanity shines through the tragedies, pulling me into their suffering: that\'s how i know that characterization can only go so far. this is what differentiates unpleasantly brilliant books from mediocre but entertaining ones.and god, the intimacy between the three characters. there is something about the chemistry, the interactions, and their thoughts that made me wonder: can love can be greater than this?in the end, i know that this book is absolutely not for everyone, and not everyone who loved and hated this will feel the same emotions throughout the experience. for now, i leave this book at 4.5 (it will change eventually) butTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrowwill stay in my mind and my heart for a long time.--------------------------pre-review:this book induces in me such profound grief, that i am feeling physically unwell.rtc once i recover'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'So I found this book very entertaining and easy to read and also disappointing at times too. Starting with what I enjoyed about the book, I found the prose so readable. Gabrielle Zevin has a knack for telling a good story and about 100 pages in, I felt immersed in her characters’ lives in a way that only some of the best writers can execute. There’s a slice-of-life quality to the storytelling inTomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrowthat helped me feel like I was gliding along with Sam, Sadie, and Marx’s lives from their college years to their early and then approaching mid-adulthood. The video game aspect of the story actually made sense to me and added a quirky touch to the novel that didn’t come across as gimmicky.I also liked the integration of social commentary in this book through the characters’ lives. I felt a lot for Sam and his struggle with his disability and Sadie with her experiences of sexism in the video game industry and in life generally. Zevin does a nice job of showing and not telling so that these elements of social justice/injustice felt organic instead of too obvious or preachy.I think my biggest critique of this book centers on Sam and Sadie’s friendship. I will couch this commentary by saying that I read a lot of literary fiction and it’s one of my favorite genres so my expectations are reasonably high. I found their friendship engaging, though at the same time I don’t think Zevin developed the foundation of their friendship enough to merit all of the conflict and turmoil they experienced. For example, Sam consistently idealizes Sadie throughout the book and is all “I love Sadie Green even though I can’t tell her” and I was like uh why?? Like I get that they had a somewhat intense bonding experience as kids and then they made video games together, but I literally had no clue why Sam actually loved Sadie – she treats him pretty horribly throughout the book as he does to her at times. I get that friends can treat each other poorly, though I struggled to believe Sam and Sadie’s bond given that they get into these intense arguments all the time and then resolve them by… forgetting and forgiving instead of communicating through the conflict and processing what actually happened?? Idk, maybe my best friendships are so healthy to the point where it feels a bit incomprehensible to me (shout-out toBrione of my bestianas who’s also on Goodreads!)As a side note, I think I’m spoiled because I read Jhumpa Lahiri’sThe LowlandandUnaccustomed Earthearlier this year and late last year respectively, and she sets the bar so high in terms of characters with rich inner lives that then manifest in their interpersonal relationships. Hanya Yanagihara pulled this off too inA Little Life, though I don’t recommend her other books lol.I also felt frustrated by the overall treatment of friendship in this novel. For the first 60% or so, there’s this implicit and explicit theme of friendship being important and special and not inferior to romance. However, this deteriorates when certain events happen later on in the book. Like, at the very end, Sam literallysays that he felt insecure that Sadie didn’t want to be with him romantically/physically because of his disability, his Asianness, his lack of wealth… which implies that he actually wanted a romantic relationship with her all along… which undercuts the importance of friendship. YikesLike, Sadie is a white woman from a wealthy background, why did Sam feel so entranced by her?? Idk, it reminds me a bit too much of Asian men who are obsessed with white women’s approval and being attractive to white women instead of loving themselves (likethis tweetdepicts). And I don’t think Zevin sufficiently showed an arc of Sam learning to love himself, even if imperfectly, which would have been my preference even if it’s not everyone’s.Anyway, as you can tell this book was engaging enough that it elicited this long of a review from me. Again, I was entertained and immersed so I can see why so many people hyped this book.

Sam, whose foot has been crushed in a car accident, hasn't spoken to anyone for months but meeting Sadie, and playing video games with her, brings Sam alive, pulls him out of his pain and heartbreak. That friendship lasts for a while until one of them feels betrayed and then it's over.Eight years later an accidental meeting has them back together. Their love of gaming, their ability to create games, leads to collaboration and the making of games. They are successes at game making but that success pulls them apart again. While the playing field can be even for everyone when they start a video game, giving everyone the same chance to build and conquer, the real world sees everyone differently. One gets more credit than the other, resentments and misunderstandings grow. Even when working together, Sam and Sadie are apart in the most hurtful ways.This is the story of Sam and Sadie but Marx is a part of that story. Marx, who plays games but doesn't make games, becomes a crucial part of Sam and Sadie's company and their lives. Marx is the best friend a person could have, he's the best partner a person could have, he's the mediator when it's needed, he's the glue that holds things together. He's the person Sam tries to imitate when he doesn't know how to go on.This story contains three decades worth of brilliance, creativity, friendship, love, romance. jealousy, resentment, isolation, miscommunication, and more. Maybe some huge successes require people to be somewhat broken and misunderstood. Definitely love does not have to be romantic to last a lifetime. When it comes to Sam and Sadie, it's taken them years and years but I do think they finally mature in the end and there is something to be said for a maturity that might allow estranged people to come back together.There is lots of talk about creating and making games and playing games. Sometimes we are in a game. I loved all of that. I understand gaming and I can get lost in the worlds that allow us to forget our real world. Worlds that allow more than one life, dying doesn't have to mean death, you have more chances to go on or start over. All of that is so interesting to me and I laughed whenever the word dysentery was mentioned. But this story really got to me because there is a lot of sadness, isolation (something gaming can even cause), and anger. I wanted everyone to be able to be a Marx. But that's not how the world works, not everyone can be a Marx, life is not that easy for everyone. I'll be thinking about this story for a long time and will probably see it differently as time goes on. It will take me a while to get over this story, I'll need time to let it just settle in my mind.Pub July 5, 2022""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is my first taste of author Gabrielle Zavin, and I have to say I was impressed, this is beautifully written and smart storytelling that goes back and forth in time, embedded in the world of gaming. I am not a gamer myself, so if you are not either, do not let this put you off, because this is essentially about the all too human aspects and the complexities of what it is to be human, the connections made through this medium, such as the relationships, the friendships and the joyful delight to be found in a perfect digital world, a sharp contrast to the problems and difficulties that are to found in the more messy real world. Sam and Sadie first meet fortuitously in the late 1980s as children in a hospital, finding common ground in playing games, like Super Mario, competitively.Memories comes flooding back when they meet again years later at a rail station as we follow their lives evolving through the decades, as they begin to create games together, setting up in business together, the creative input balanced by the grounding and practical presence of Marx. They do extremely well which brings all the pressures and trappings associated with success. The characters are vivid, distinct and from diverse backgrounds, in a narrative that touches on a wide variety of issues and themes that resonate, like identity, love, loss, family, technology, race, disability, betrayal and inevitable failures, and what is important in life.We are given a insightful glimpse into the gaming industry, its history and business side, and how gaming can help people endure hard times through the escapism it offers. A brilliant and imaginative read that I think will appeal to many readers.

And at the centre - love and friendship of course.“What is a game?"" Marx said. ""It\'s tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow. It\'s the possibility of infinite rebirth, infinite redemption. The idea that if you keep playing, you could win. No loss is permanent, because nothing is permanent, ever.”The PlotA chance meeting at a hospital is to connect the lives of Sadie and Sam through video gaming and home entertainment. A relationship that is tested, grows, changes, and suffers from many of the obstacles life creates - love, greed, misunderstanding, vanity, discrimination, domestic violence, abuse, death and many more.However, the constant in their lives is the love and ambition for inventing and playing video games. Yet, like many winning partnerships, their loyalty is tested when fame and success enters their lives and the two struggle with each other, despite the intervention of their loyal friend Marx.While the book includes many side stories and sub plots, the core to this book is the relationship between Sadie, Sam and also Marx with some important themes for the reader to reflect on. There is a sad moment in the book that will play on my mind tomorrow, and tomorrow and tomorrow!!! But I will not spoil here.Review and CommentsIt was all about the writing style and relationships for me that took the meaning of gaming to a whole new level. The characters felt so real and genuine which came through in the writing and turned a seemingly ordinary plot into something extraordinary.My favourite character was Marx although the two characters at the centre of the story were well developed and had such redeeming and less desirable qualities which I loved because this felt ‘real’.There are a few elements to the story that did not work so well for me. For example, using the title and references from Shakespeare’s Macbeth (and others) “Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow” implied there was going to be a connection and relevance to the gaming world. The sense of infinity yes but some of the Shakespeare quotes peppered throughout just didn’t work and at times it felt awkward. Only an opinion.I also believe that my reading experience would have been marginally better had I been more familiar with the gaming jargon. So, I decided to set that aside and focus on the relationships at the centre of the story and only then did the book make sense to me.A modern take on some timeless themes. A story of reinvention, infinity, and the possibility of a different life, but also a stark reminder that life is complicated, complex, painful and sometimes intolerable but it is also what we make of it. Despite the distractions and when the game of life becomes the cruelty of life, it is up to the individual to decide on the appropriate course of action, because after all there are no rules and no winners. Just love and friendship made better through willingness and forgiveness.The focus on relationships was superb but I particularly loved the reinvention of Sadie and Sam’s relationship and the quote that says it all…“The way to turn an ex-lover into a friend is to never stop loving them, to know that when one phase of a relationship ends it can transform into something else. It is to acknowledge that love is both a constant and a variable at the same time.”I loved that “Love is both constant and variable”. True of many relationships. Overall an excellent book, there is no doubt that this book will continue to be enjoyed by many tomorrow, and tomorrow and tomorrow!!!.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '**WINNER OF GOODREADS FICTION GENRE, THIS ONE IS SPECIAL**Initially I had trouble getting through parts of this book and even put it aside for a day. Some of the details of designing, coding and playing video games were tedious for me to read.However, when I tried to get into another book – the characters of THIS BOOK kept calling me back. From 30% on I was invested and fell in love with Sadie, Sam and Marx.It’s important to note that this book covers several decades so it’s hard to describe all that happens with these characters!!Sam and Sadie meet in a hospital. Sadie is there to visit her sister, who is undergoing cancer treatment, and Sam is a patient. He was in a horrific car accident and his foot has been repaired but it will never be normal!! He will be in constant pain!!Sadie and Sam bond over their love of video games, mazes, etc.“They had the rare kind of friendship that allowed for a great deal of privacy within it.”There is a point where Sadie and Sam don’t see each other for years but when they are back together the magic is still there. Ideas are worked out together, code is written, Marx is the producer and promoter andfor a long time all is good.As with all human relationships that span decades, these three will go through many changes, and it’s wonderful to watch how they grow. All the emotions are here, friendship, love, happiness, grief, depression, exuberance – all so well described that I felt it with them!!The writing in this book is absolutely wonderful. I love this quote from Marx“What is a game? Marx said. “It’s tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. It’s the possibility of infinite rebirth, infinite redemption”.I already miss these characters so much! I would encourage you to give this novel a try, even if you’ve never played a video game in your life!!!I received an ARC of this novel from the publisher through NetGalley.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'this is a story about a boy and a girl, ""often in love, but never lovers,"" who meet as children and choose to become creative partners once they become adults. that choice leads them to fantastic success--and failure, and turmoil, and heartbreak. it brings them together and forces them apart many times over many years as they navigate disability, race, class, and violence together.this book was MADE for me. and you. and your best friend. and anybody with a pulse. and everybody needs to read this partly because i\'m 300% sure the world would be better if we did, but mostly because everybody deserves to experience a masterpiece at least once in their life, and this is a masterpiece.i think this is maybe my favorite book i\'ve ever read, and i don\'t say that lightly. it\'s worth ALL of the hype. sam & sadie are infuriating, arrogant, kind, and real, and their stories will sit with me for a very long time. i think i will need to reread this about 3902 more times in order to have an opinion that i can easily put to words, but for now just know that my plan is to make everybody in my life read this book. and you. also you.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""I hate to come in and be a Debbie Downer for this book, but sometimes this happens. There is a specific kind of sentimentality or emotion that just does not work for me at all, but that a lot of people find extremely compelling. It is a matter of personal taste, it is not really about whether a book is inherently good or bad. You either like a book that will purposely tug at your heartstrings or you don't. I don't, ergo this book was not for me.The thing is, that I liked the first half of this book pretty well. I enjoyed the way we see Sam and Sadie, who became friends through playing video games as kids, and the way they come together and then break apart. I liked seeing how their grudges and resentments could trickle in to cause problems, and then it could all be erased through their joy of gaming together.About halfway through this book I started to get suspicious. I had a feeling that we were being set up for something. That the stakes were being purposely heightened. I did not like it! I kept seeing danger around every turn when that was not what kind of book this was. Until, well, I ended up being right after all. I did not like the last half at all. It felt manipulative and bordering on maudlin. It didn't feel like it really earned what it was going for. Also, slight spoiler thoughts behind a tag,Marx is just not a real person! He has no flaws, apparently, besides sleeping around in his early 20's. He is handsome and charming and loyal and apparently good at everything? I never bought his relationship with Sadie and it felt contrived just to give Sadie something to grieve. He is basically an ex machina to make everything happen in the book, it got very annoying.I do not think you need to be a gamer at all to read this book. I'm not and I was able to be invested in everything along the way. Zevin is deft at explaining what makes a game compelling without boring anyone. Ultimately this is a book about friendship that just happens to be set around video games.There were lots of little things that irked me along the way (I will be so happy if I never read another book where a character attends Harvard) particularly Dov's character, who is a pretty terrible person but that everyone decides is just fine because all that happened so long ago, right? It was pretty weird, especially since he treats the only major female character so badly. But there were also lots of little things that I enjoyed, little threads that Zevin would drop and then pick up again (secret highways, the history of Sam's mother, etc.).I just wanted to read a perfectly boring book about Sam and Sadie working together, the highs and lows of their friendship. (In a lot of ways this is similar to a bottle episode of Mythic Quest that I liked a lot, though this had the potential to be better because it was based on friendship more than romance.) But I suspect this book's target audience isn't interested in that and they are here to have their heartstrings pulled. If that is you, there is a lot here that I think you'll like. And the video game elements really serve to distinguish it from the pack.I did the audio version of this book, the reader had actually also read another book I'd read just a few days earlier. I like her style, which she does adjust to the material, but is more of a flat reading than an overly emotional one. I think it suits, balancing out some of the elements in the book. She also has to do a lot of accents, which she manages quite well.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""⭐️Goodreads Award Best Fiction⭐️My top read for 2022. A brilliant coming of age masterpiece, spanning almost 30 years. An epic tale of friendship, love, art, video games, and the journey of life.As a teen, I played my fair share of Sonic, Mario Brothers, etc, but nothing with the intensity of this book, realistic games that blur reality and fantasy. I was immersed.Gabrielle Zevin weaved a layered story, carefully crafting characters within the backdrop of gaming. She was able to peak my interest which speaks to the beauty of her writing.This is the story of Sam and Sadie, Sam and Marx, Sadie and Marx, and their journey building a successful gaming company. Sam and Sadie meet in the most unexpected places-a hospital. Sadie's sister is undergoing cancer treatment, while Sam, is recovering from a major injury that leaves him disabled. Sam and Sadie connect over their love for games. Sadie becomes an integral piece of Sam's life and his recovery.Time moves forward, Sam and Marx are roommates at Harvard. Marx is an aspiring actor while Sam pursues his passion for making games. One day, Sam happens to meet Sadie on campus (she's there for a gaming meeting) and they connect (over Oregon Trail of all things). Sadie gives Sam a game she's working on, and the rest is gaming history--a story of creating amazing, creative games together.Tomorrow, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow (an ode to MacBeth, which later, ties beautifully into one of the characters arcs) is the story of missed opportunities, successes, pains, love, and a passion for art.There is a time for any fledgling artist where one’s taste exceeds one’s abilities. The only way to get through this period is to make things anywayZevin not only created amazing virtual worlds I'd love to play, she wrote an entire chapter within a game--literal genius. There was also a chapter in second person, which may feel out of place to some, but made sense in the context of the character's journey.Initially, I was bogged down by all the gaming conversations, but it's worth it to continue reading. The beginning ties in wonderfully as we learn the struggles of creating true art. Zevin also touches upon some important cultural/political topics that helped move the story along.The truth is, I cried and cheered for these wonderfully written characters, like friends more than fictional souls.I recently read, 'The Storied Life of A.J. Fikery,' and became an instant fan of Zevin. It feels remarkably coincidental that her new book came right after--alas, the stars aligned.I savored Tomorrow, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, felt protective of the words, and had a sense of reverence to the story. Have you ever felt a physical reaction after finishing a book? I was in a melancholy state, wanting to be transported into the pages, stilling time.How could a person still be as young as he objectively knew himself to be and have had so much time pass?As I closed the last page, my daughter wanted to be tucked into bed, yet I wanted to sit with the book and fall asleep- savoring the story. It was hard to let go, say goodbye. The characters came to life in a way that felt tangible.There was the life that you lived, which consisted of the choices you made. And then, there was the other life, the one that was the things you hadn’t chosen. And sometimes, this other life felt as palpable as the one you were living.^^This quote moved my soul.5 spectacular stars!""}]"

NEXT!and the suspense element was also much better in the first book because there was actually some action. the suspense (can we even call it that?) in this was so badly done compared to the first book. i think i appreciate ava and alex\'s story more in that aspect because we actually see it unfold and, like i said, there was actually some action. not only that, but right from the beginning, we\'re thrown into this ""suspenseful"" act so we go through the book wondering what\'s happening (even if you know what it was). with this, there was none of it for me.i liked that bridget volunteers at an animal shelter. my vegan animal loving self just loves everything animal care related.that\'s basically it.eh, i’m excited for jules and josh’s book though!and stella and christian? with that ending? 👀'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'OMFG this was so good !!! way better than the first one. this book fucked me up !! literally my bones were shaking the entire time i was reading this.Rhys -fuck !!! he’s a MFing DILF !!! this zaddy could take me anywhere. ok so get this - Bridget is the royal princess, she has some authority, but guess who’s in charge?

It was a bit long-winded, but compared to instalove, I\'ll take a slow burn any day. While this didn\'t break any new ground and is pretty much what you\'d expect from the trope, it was still fun.

I feel like something was missing. Was it better chemistry, more snarky banter? I\'m not sure. All I know is what I got felt like a paler version of what it could\'ve been. Or maybe the problem is me and I built this up so much in my head, nothing could possibly meet it.One thing I do know for sure is that Ana Huang\'s male characters are a bit too much for me. They\'re so sexed up and possessive, it\'s hard to take them seriously. They way they talk and act, you\'d think they came straight from the chest-thumping Stone Age. No other man can even look at their women, lest glares and threats erupt from their mouths. They\'re constantly like, Who do you belong to? Me! And that\'s more or less verbatim.And the sex scenes. Ugh, I feel like such an old fuddy duddy for saying this, but they were so frequent and unrealistic in that porny way, I was cringing with embarrassment for the characters. I enjoyed the first third of the book so much more simply because there was no sex in it. But the last two-thirds felt like every other scene was dramatic sex, and I was so over it.It\'s hard to really enjoy a story if I\'m cringing my way through so much of it, and that\'s what happened here. Obviously, romances are personal, and this is clearly a case where my tastes just don\'t quite line up with the author\'s. And there\'s nothing wrong with that. Plenty of readers love this series; I just wish I were one of them.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:#1.Twisted Love~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'I changed the rating to 4.75 from a 4.5. Here’s the thing—this had all of the makings of a 5 star book EXCEPT for the fact that I found the beginning quite slow. And I fully get that its slow burn, its meant to be that way, but I can’t ignore how i felt when I was still in the beginning stages.There are TONS of build up in part 1, and the book itself really started taking off for me in part 2. The build up in part 1 is still soooo good, especially looking back at it now. I definitely appreciate it more after finishing the whole book more than i did when i was going through it.I am so obsessed with Rhys and Bridget, but obviously definitely Rhys because that’s my guyyyyy.Bearded, protective, HOTTTT, possessive, supports and adores and loves Bridget so much. OOOOOF, come to mama.Bridget is my favorite from the friend group I think. And I definitely liked this book wayyyy more than i liked the first one, twisted love.I think the writing improved a ton, and the time jumps were that much easier to follow whereas i felt like it was a little difficult to know how much time had passed in the first book (one of the main reasons I gave that a 4). This one is just way better for me. ITS STEAMIER, ITS SO POSSESSIVE, the tension between them. I’m literally so into it 😂And I cant stop thinking about Rhys. This man is BEAUTIFUL. All of the qualities i like in my alpha characters.How part 1 felt for me is mainly the reason this isn’t getting 5 stars because i feel like that’s my first impression and it’s like one of those things where when i was in school, people always told me to go with the first answer when i was taking an exam 😂 so I’m applying that same theory here LMAOChef’s kiss, i hope you guys enjoy this when you get to it!

Rhys and Bridget will always be one of my favourite couples of all time and I honestly can’t get enough of them!!First of all, this book has one of my favourite (but also one of the most painful) tropes of all time in it: Forbidden love!!!This alone already had me hooked and in love but the way it was executed… COMPLETE AND UTTER PERFECTION!!!!!The secrecy, the tension, the pining, the chemistry.. UGH it was just all soooo good and so well written!!! The way they both wanted one another since the beginning.. I was MELTINGGGG!!!!The way the forbidden love trope was mixed with the bodyguard x princess trope made it even better!!! The vibes and settings in this book were absolutely immaculate!! From gorgeous Costa Rica to a stunning castle ugh I LOVE IT!!! I honestly need more books like that with that sort of setting, it’s just so… romantic!!!Speaking of romantic, THESE TWO ARE DEFINITION OF SAID WORD!!!!!!I was literally squealing, giggling, kicking my feet, twirling my hair and blushing like a goddamn tomato!! They were just so adorable!! They had everything they needed to have! Banter, chemistry, tension (romantic and sexual), cuteness, jealousy, spice and MOREEEE!!! They’re just so perfectly written I could cry!!!The way they’re also each others’ rocks?!?!Like Rhys being able to be himself and open up to someone for the first time and feeling so comfortable and feeling AT HOME with Bridget, made my heart beat a million miles per second!!!Same the other way around!! Bridget feeling so at ease with him and actually being able to lean on someone and getting supported by Rhys… It was just so endearing to see them both act so sweetly with each other! No (pure) romance book couple has ever lived up to their love (if you ask me)!!!!!Rhys is also the most perfect man ever!!! He’s definitely the best Twisted man and he might not be YOUR favourite but you can definitely admit that he is THE BEST out of all the Twisted men! Like the way he stood by Bridget no matter what, fought so strongly for their love and is willing to give up everything just to see her happy?!!! I’m crying, screaming…And HE DOES NO WRONG!!!! He didn’t need to grovel because HE IS PERFECT IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE (if it isn’t obvious enough I’m pretty much in love with him lol)Anyway.. besides the romance, I loved the sub-plot of politics and monarchy! It was amazingly involved into the plot and just shows how corrupt the system can be (most definitely not only in fiction).Seeing Ava and Alex again, happy and together, was also so pleasing to read about and seeing the other characters as well was so endearing!Let’s just say I loved every second of this book and if you haven’t read it yet… GET TO IT NOW!!!!! It is worth EVERYTHING!!! Even if you may have disliked the first book, definitely give this one a try!!Overall, this will most likely always be my favourite romance book and Ana Huang book ever and I’m so glad to have read it not only once but twice!! And I’m already looking forward to rereading it again sometime in the future! I also can’t wait to reread Twisted Hate tomorrow!!'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'I still cant get over the fact that how the fuck this series is so hyped 💀...especially when there are better..WAY better and sexier books than this'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '✩ 4.35 stars ✩“I was a rule follower by nature.

But for Bridget, I would break every rule in the book.”What to Expect:➼ Princess x Body Guard➼ Age Gap (10 years)➼ Forced Proximity➼ Forbidden Romance➼ Secret Relationship➼ Touch Her & Die➼ Sizzling Chemistry➼ Slow Burn➼ Grumpy x Sunshine➼ Dual POVI disliked Twisted Love so much that it took me 2 years and dozens of glowing reviews to convince me to give this series another shot. Happy to report that the rumors are true! Twisted Games really is as good as they say. Maybe I just love all men named Rhys 🤔, but I felt like I was reading a grown up version of the Princess Diaries and I mean that as the highest compliment. The two year jump in their relationship threw me a little at first, but I think it was needed to support that he really was a professional and that his heart softened to her over time.After her brother abdicates his claim to the thrown, Bridget finds herself as the unexpected heir. With this unwelcome change, she feels the last vestiges of her free will slipping away and creates a lists of things she wants to do before she takes the thrown. She basically propositions him, and I felt that this was the best way for them to finally come together. I don’t think he would have ever crossed that line if he hadn’t felt like it was what she needed. He could deny himself, but he couldn’t deny her anything. 🙌🏻 He also thought they would be parting ways since she would no longer need private security once she was living at the palace full time which added to the plausibility of him choosing to break protocol with her.This was a little longer than I typically like a contemporary romance to be, but I always felt very engaged in the story. Their chemistry was sizzling and their backstories and personalities were perfectly developed. I LOVED that we got to read from both POV’s. Nothing beats dual POV with a strait-laced grumpy MMC.

There were also constant, non-stop time jumps that made it completely impossible to actually see any (supposed) development between these two: It’s all tell, and no show. We never really went into detail in any conversation or situation: we literally glanced over everything.Also, Rhys was the most bland hero ever and Bridget had no personality either. All of their interactions honestly bored me to tears or simply just pissed me off. They had no chemistry at all.Part of me wanted to push her away from me, and another part wanted to drag her into my arms and keep her as mine. Except I couldn’t. Bridget was too young, too innocent and too off-limits, and I’d damn well better not forget that.So all in all, there simply wasn’t any depth to be found here, and neither did I see any actual love between them. Once they actually got together all they ever did was have sex. They had no emotional intimacy whatsoever.“Remember. In public, you’re my princess, but in private, you’re my whore.” His other hand reached down and pinched my swollen clit until I squealed, and the beginning tremors of an orgasm rocked through me. “You’ll do what I say, when I say it, and you’ll take my cock however I want. Won’t you?”“Yes,” I breathed.And don’t even get me started on the dirty talk or the weird power dynamics between these two during sex… Every time they were together in anintimateway I just had to cringe.“Keep your underwear, gloves and heels on, and crawl to me.”My breath gusted out in shock even as my core spasmed at the order. I’d never crawled for anyone in my life—while I was all but naked, no less. Even if I wasn’t the future queen, it would be degrading. Humiliating. Depraved. And I’d never been more turned on.I sank to my hands and knees, and I began to crawl.Lastly, the plot in this book was seriously as uninteresting and boring as humanly possible.

I love characters that wear a mask and pretend everything’s okay when they’re actually dealing with a ton (bc I relate) Bridget’s totally like that—seems tough, but you can tell there’s a lot more going on beneath the surface.❝The message: in control and ready to take over.The reality: a complete mess.❞^ THIS is what I’m talking about. Bridget’s journey was wild. Watching her shift into “queen mode” over just a few months? Iconic.

I thought it was gonna take me forever because it’s longer, but nope. One sitting. Done. The writing? Okay, it’s not gonna win any awards, but it’s like crack. I couldn’t put it down.The relationship? A slow burn to the MAX. Like, it took years for them to admit their feelings and attraction. And honestly, I’m here for it. I read another bodyguard romance recently, and they fell for each other way too fast for my liking. But this one? They really made us work for it, and I was vibing with the tension. I think it was done really well, no filler scenes to slow it down.Now, the plot? Um... it was a bit of a mess. (Typical for this author, honestly.) Rhys suddenly being royalty? Not buying it. But the betrayal from Bridget’s assistants? That was believable. Still, the whole royal blood thing felt forced. I hate to say it, but the book didn’t deserve all the hype. Like, yeah, I enjoyed Bridget. Rhys was hot. The spice was great, but that was basically it. It’s getting a lot of praise, and while I enjoyed it, I don’t think it lives up to the hype everyone’s giving it. I expected something extraordinary.**The Side Characters**Ava was just... there. Totally forgettable, as expected. Every time Alex was mentioned, I was like *eye roll*—sorry not sorry. Jules, though? Always fun. And that scene with her disappearing with Josh at the end? 👀 Christian is the real star. He’s twisted, insane, and I’m hooked on his storyline. The way he was eyeing Stella at the end? Can’t wait for that drama to unfold. Christian and Stella? That\'s what I’m living for in this series.So yeah, overall, I’m torn. I loved Bridget and the slow-burn romance, but the plot was messy, and some of the hype feels overblown. Still, if you\'re here for hot characters, slow-burn tension, and a little bit of chaos, this one’s definitely worth the read.

I wasn\'t a fan of the inclusion of the ""recipes"" (one was for scrambled egg?!) or fictional satirical emails either.I’ve enjoyed Dolly’s writing in The Sunday Times magazine in the past, but this collection of “hilarious” anecdotes of her making poor choices in men and doing drugs/getting drunk while seemingly not learning much left me feeling frustrated. And the conclusion that female friendships are the important thing overall? I didn’t buy it - all of the stories shared throughout the rest of the book didn’t support this conclusion. Only Dolly’s friend Farly comes out of this book looking good!Reading about other people being hungover and self absorbed throughout their 20s (while not doing much else) doesn\'t make for a fun read, at least for me, anyway. I don\'t know why so many people in their early 30s are writing memoirs these days - collections of anecdotes that were hilarious (for you) at the time aren’t bringing anything new or insightful to the table for the rest of us.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I really wanted to like this book but I’ve been left disappointed. Lured in by the hype around it and also by the title, which should have probably been ‘everything I know about being single and having friends’. I thought it was a slight cop out to write a book supposedly all about what you know about love, then finish by saying “I’ve never really experienced it other than with my girl friends”. The value of your friendships is a fair point but should that really be the conclusion of this book?The random emails and recipes are boring and could have been left out. It became tiresomely long and I was rushing to get to the end. Which is a shame because I thought I was enjoying the book in the first few chapters. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it really reads like an over-privileged, white middle-class woman, who doesn’t have much self awareness about her own privileges. I think she might think a lot of what she’s writing - about excessive drinking, drug taking, tinder dates, paying extortionate taxi fares for the lols - is relatable, and maybe it is for other people in her social bracket, but it’s not to me. There’s a level of self-deprecation and self-obsession that’s funny, but there’s too much of it in this book.

Because I am happy without any of those things.I didn't feel judged, exactly. This is a good and nonjudgmental book. I just felt maybe a little unwelcome.It isn't on the author - it's on me! It's a pandemic and I'm so sensitive about the ways my life looks right now. It's hard already being in your early or mid-twenties and spending them in a state of lockdown. This book exacerbated that FOMO, a bit.Anyway, the author never says you can't do any of these things, but if you do, or if you don't have an excess of platonic love in your life - if you have fewer friends or shallower relationships - you may not feel at home in these pages.It's surely on me and not the author, but I didn't.Bottom line: A good book for a future me!--------------tbr reviewi've heard so much about this book in such a short amount of time that i have no choice but to take it as a sign from the universe""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'mini reviewall i have to say is that i love my best friend.this was so profoundly and beautifully written while also being light and humorous. dolly alderton is obviously an incredibly talented writer & i am so happy i read this for one of my first books of 2022.⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻“she knows where to find everything in me and i know where all her stuff is too. she is, in short, my best friend.”this was my first full read of 2022, and i am so happy i started with this. this review is going to be more personal than my other reviews, so here is a tiny disclaimer.there’s a certain addictiveness about dolly alderton’s writing. she’s funny, witty, and obviously an extremely good writer. i flew through the pages (while the initial 100 pages were rough + could have been cut down a bit, the rest of the book was so beautifully written that i couldn\'t help but give this five stars).what i loved the most about this book is her friendships, especially the one she has with farley. i adored the way she spoke about her best friend, about how they are two halves of a whole and how they have left ‘no pebble unturned’. it did not take me long to realize that this memoir is not about men or relationships, it is more of a love letter to her best friend and the friendships she has in her life. i really appreciated that.i cried big ugly tears and sent quotes to my own best friend because alderton encapsulated exactly how i feel about her; i love her to pieces and pieces, till death do us part, all the clichés.this is my favorite part out of the entire book:""i want to know what that feels like, to be truly committed to someone, rather than having one foot out the door.""""you\'re too hard on yourself,"" she said. ""you can do long-term love. you\'ve done it better than anyone i know.""""how? my longest relationship was two years and that was over when i was twenty-four.""""i\'m talking about you and me,"" she said.another thing i loved that she touched on was on the lull of life, which feels fitting to read about, especially during a pandemic where things are inevitably less ‘exciting’ than before. there’s a quote on getting older in your 20s that really resonated with me:“you are realizing the mundanity of life. you are finally understanding how little point there is to anything. you are moving out of the realm of fantasy \'when i grow up\' and adjusting to the reality that you\'re there; it\'s happening. and it\'s wasn\'t what you thought it might be. you are not who you thought you\'d be.”this hit me way harder than i thought it would. because i think it’s true in a sense: your twenties are most likely going to be much more anticlimactic than you thought it would be. i think the pandemic has especially left me disillusioned regarding some aspects of my life. but also, i do think that life is about appreciating the mundanity that is so despised, and realizing that usually, the small fleeting moments in life are the ones that truly matter.whether it’s mundane or special, that’s up to you.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""I listened to Everything I Know About Love on audiobook, mostly during my commute. This was good and bad - good because I hate to not finish books and there's no way I would've finished this if I had to dedicate 100% of my attention to it, as opposed to listening whilst travelling, cleaning etc. However, the bad was that I perhaps would've interpreted it differently in book form. In audio form, I found Dolly frustrating, whiney and self-indulgent where I might have taken the written format more light heartedly.I don't want to be too harsh about this memoir because it's ultimately someone's life and that feels wrong. However my low rating was largely due to the awful, selfish attitude Dolly takes to her friendships. I understand the odd pang of envy when friends are getting married and you're far behind, but Dolly seemed to genuinely wish for her friends lives to go wrong just so their attention could be focused on her. Yet when something does go wrong, she swoops in and describes all the things she said and did because she's such a great friend - it came across as incredibly self-indulgent.There was the odd part of this book which made me think and reflect, but mostly I wanted it to end as I was so irritated by it. I didn't find it funny and, at one point, inadvertently groaned and willed it to stop out loud when it went on.. and on.. and on about some unfunny text messages about bins.

But I think my problem is that this isn't what it actually was - rather it was a focus on her, and she happened to have female friends as her most lasting connection, which felt very different (and it was all a bit 'look at me, I'm such a great friend') . I guess my main problem was that I found her very narcissistic and unlikeable.

I\'m sure tons of people told her she was so hilarious she should write a book about her life... these people were wrong.The fact of the matter is, Alderton, a woman in her early thirties, hasn\'t yet achieved anything so remarkable thus far as to warrant a lengthy (at least it felt lengthy) memoir at this stage of her life and equally doesn\'t possess the wit to make up for the deficit of compelling content (although she would have you believe otherwise).The book (if you can call it that) is mostly a collection of meandering anecdotes of drunken debauchery - the kind of ""you had to be there"" stories that were ""so hilarious"" at the time that seem painfully dull and misguided to anyone who wasn\'t. We get it. You got drunk and stayed up late a lot in your 20s. Big swingin\' Mickey.What\'s even more annoying is that Alderton plays this smug self-aware card, trying to make out that she knows she was an immature dope for most of her life but it doesn\'t work because the growth she exhibits from the beginning of the memoir to the end is minimal and the overriding tone of ""my life might be a mess but I\'m more witty and cool than you\'ll ever be"" throughout the entire journey is sick-making. This feeling is particularly accelerated by the addition of word count-padding fake satirical emails and inexplicable recipes that feel lifted straight from an online blog.Reading through Alderton\'s musings on ""love"" as she puts them, it seems as though her emotional development came to an abrupt halt at around 15 or 16 - not only in relation to romantic love but also platonic love. She consistently posits that she is ""obsessed"" with men, yet her ability to navigate romantic partnerships with any sort of emotional maturity seems to dwindle in direct proportion to her growing and naive possessiveness over the long-held platonic female relationships in her life.Dressing it up as a message of female empowerment and solidarity, Alderton attempts to stress to her audience the importance of female friendships that shouldn\'t be dropped in favour of the latest man on the scene.I mean, that\'s all well and good but is that really what\'s going on here? Throughout the entire book, again and again, Alderton talks about men and her female friends\' boyfriends as if they were mere playthings and distractions whom she sees as obstacles getting in the way ofherfriendships. She doesn\'t shy away from the fact that she is quite selfishly vehemently resentful when her best friend Farly gets engaged. Her relationship with Farly is the most highlighted of the book by far, and at times feels so insidiously and unnecessarily possessive that you are left wondering whether indeed Alderton is just severely closeted.To conclude, this is the kind of narcissistic, navel-gazing type of writing that perpetuates the negative stereotype of the entitled millennial with no real problems and it makes me sad all day.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I really had to push myself to get through this one and at about 50% into it- I just couldn’t.

I would highly recommend.I don't read an awful lot of auto-biographical stuff but I knew of Dolly already, through her PanDolly and High-Low podcasts with Pandora Sykes and her amusing dating column in the Sunday Times. And when it popped up on NetGalley, I wanted it. I wanted it real bad. So, yes: this is a NetGalley freebie but thoughts are my own, of course: what is the point otherwise?So. Everything I Know About Love. That title isn't really a misnomer, not exactly, but it does set you up to think that it's about capital L Love - you know, Carrie Bradshaw's ridiculous, all-consuming, can't-live-without-it Love. But Dolly herself would be the first person to tell you that she has very little experience of that Love, actually. (Pun intended.) Would she like more? Yes. But has she been without love? That's a definite no there, my friend. This book is full of love, in its wild and various guises, but it shines most brightly in Dolly's over-whelming and supportive (but not always healthy) love for her friends, a tight knit group of woman who live with, live for, fight with and fight for each other. I won't lie; I was very jealous. Dolly, her best friend Farley and their extended group of wonderful women have something very special - and Dolly never, ever forgets that.I was eager for this book, you know. I was hungry. And I gulped it all up in three big bites, staying up later than I really should to finish it off. I think the fun here for me was, admittedly, partly because because Dolly and I are both English and close in age. There were many similarities for us, although she is definitely a lot posher. I don't mind saying that I'm a bit older than her, so I did miss some of those cultural things, especially the pure sheer devotion to local MSN - I used it, too, but I talked to people in America who were a little ahead of us here. But there's always interest for me in people who started to come of age as the internet did. (That's probably self-absorbed, but there it is.)And you know how they always say that New York is the fifth character in Sex and the City? Well, if London isn't a main role here, it was definitely a scene-stealing extra, popping up frequently and joyfully. Having lived in London for almost fifteen years now, I feel like the city was beautifully painted, mostly via a vividly ramshackle Camden Town.The reoccurring lists in this book were a real highlight for me. Dolly writes a literal list of what she knows about love at different ages and, my god, if they weren't exactly the lists I would have written at the same times. If they haven't aged and mellowed just like I have. If they haven't sharpened and become less likely to take your bullshit just like I have. They were perfect, truly.And one last thing I wanted to mention: Dolly writes a beautiful meditation on the difference between intensity and intimacy that left me reeling. A crazy, all-consuming relationship she has almost entirely over text which ends in a flurry of drama felt almost rude, the way it was pointing a big finger straight at me. I saw myself there and it made me put my Kindle down, as I was laying in bed next to the love of my life, and think about just that. I have been there, Dolly, I have lived that existence, confusing intimacy and intensity, trying to stretch the fizz of excitement into something more sustainable. But champagne goes flat and what you're left with after the bubbles have gone isn't entirely palatable. I loved it at the time and I'm so glad it's over.

This book felt like a coming-of-age memoir about Dolly’s relationships both with people around her and herself.I really liked how she shared the hard-won wisdom she acquired through experiences such as experiencing her best friend get engaged, some tumultuous relationships with men, and navigating therapy and her own self-development. There were quite a few emotional moments that hit me hard, like when she wrote about her fear of her friendship with Farly changing due to Farly’s romantic relationship developing, or her missing the oodles of time she had in her late teens and her twenties. I think the combination of Alderton’s self-aware honesty and the quality of her writing is what makes her emotional disclosure feel so rewarding to me as a reader. And, as a 28-year-old who’s had similar experiences to her – though with a lot of different social identities, lol – I found much of her perspective relatable. What I cherish about this book the most is that even though romantic love is discussed quite a bit, it’s clear that Alderton genuinely prioritizes her relationships with her friends and with herself, which is also how I live my life.I give this book four stars instead of five because it could have been more streamlined.

Obviously I don't need an author to have had the same experiences as me to enjoy a book, but I feel like with this book especially you need to have some personal connection with the content for it to resonate with you—I didn't.And so what I thought was going to be an emotionally impactful read in theory ended up being a forgettable, meh book in actuality.Also, I didn't think that this book necessarily needed to exist...?Alderton writes about her early 20s, romantic relationships, female friendships, therapy sessions all in a pretty conversational way, with the takeaway from all those things being: accept yourself, you're great just as you are, you're good enough, etc. etc. I don't know, I didn't feel like I needed to read 368 pages of a book to get that message.The destination did not make up for the journey, here, and so I ended up enjoying neither.(This would've worked better as a limited series podcast, maybe.)The beginning and end of it is: I just didn't care.

I would first like to say that as an avid lover of any book with ""villain"" in the title I have good authority to speak on this and say that Trystan (idk if thats even how you spell his name) was the worst ""villain"" I\'ve ever read about. When I heard that this book was marketed as a mix between the office and Ella enchanted, I was expecting this villain to be giving Megamind or Gru, but instead for most of the book all I got was just some guy who had a vendetta against the king... like okay and??? The fact that she didn\'t give us his backstory and the reason he was the notorious villain before page 323, aka 10 pages before the end of the book, was a huge mistake. I fully believe that I would\'ve been more invested in the downfall of the King had I known the reason Trystan was so against him. I also would\'ve liked to see more actual ""evil"" actions because there was only the mention of torture, some heads hanging from the ceiling, and a scene where he broke a dudes arm, but my guy breaking the arm gave more ""feyre fell down a hole and broke her arm :/"" and not ""rhysand in the court of nightmares breaking a man\'s arm for calling feyre a whore"". essentially, and I hate that I\'m saying this, I needed more Rhysand energy in here, and I know what y\'all read so I know y\'all know what energy I\'m talking about. Going back to the ""he\'s just some guy"" statement, I wanted him grumpier, there was essentially no grump except when he was hosting a one man pity party for himself because he had feelings :( and like yea dude, you\'re literally just some guy. where\'s your persona? literally, because I don\'t understand where the civilians would\'ve heard about him and called him a villain. give me civilian lore from the eyes of a teenage girl about why he\'s the villain and maybe then I\'ll agree that he\'s a morally grey villain.Now that I wrote an essay on the villain alone, I will continue on to Evie. I hated her as a character, I\'m going to say it. She was just there and she wasn\'t smart, she wasn\'t dumb, she just existed. All I knew about her was that her dad was ill, she left school to take care of her family, and she was a personality hire. She was portrayed as this somewhat innocent person who had first believed that The Villain was a bad guy, that she had morals of what was right and what was wrong, but Trystan promising her to not torture anyone and one look at his fucking thighs and she was hanging heads in the entry way for him??? not only was I confused, but where\'s the angst of fighting with the morality of having to work for the villain to help your family? and I know that y\'all are gonna say ""but meredith this was a cozy fantasy :/"" yea I know, I\'m not saying this angst had to go on for a long time but Evie and the Villain joking together after this fight of morality and her finding that understanding of why Trystan was the Villain after all would\'ve hit so much harder. also Evie, girl, why the fuck are you wearing stilettos?? you walk in a forest everyday to go to work and everyone keeps saying how clumsy you are??? wear a chunky heel for gods sakes.now that I think I\'m done ripping apart the main characters, let me get into ripping apart the story. I also hated that. for this part I will use bullet points.- Why the hell did it jump from the prologue into being five months later? I feel like we missed a few crucial moments of Evie building relationships amongst the other people in the office. Like why the fuck do you not like Rebecka? I get why she doesn\'t like you, she wants your job, but what did she do to you??- What the fuck was up with the magic system? it was never explained, I\'m literally still confused. there are three things that I have gathered about the system:1. It may be genetic???2. There are gods that threw down power???3. It just randomly awakens one day and only sometimes a magic person can sense it before???there were no clear answers to any of these and I still don\'t know how Trystan\'s magic worked which I think would\'ve been a helpful explanation.- The romance was not it for me. There was just like nothing there. When I have a romance I like seeing WHY the two people like each other for other reasons than just being pretty, or having a great laugh/the ability to make you laugh. this is where the building of the relationship wouldve been great to see from those five missing months.- this isn\'t that serious but the line ""I\'m. His. Fucking. Assistant."" really just pissed me off because you\'re telling me that you have a last line before you cut some man\'s throat, the throat of a man who literally assaulted you and tried to BUY you, and the last thing you say to him is that youre an assistant? was that supposed to make me cheer? I just.. maybe it\'s because I have Aelin in my head telling Maeve that she was a god before she ""unleashed herself"" but girlie, Evie, you could do better.- The last thing that really ground my gears was the author on TikTok alluding to there being any semblance of smut in this book in multiple videos and there was genuinely zero. the closest thing to smut was alluding to Trystan having a boner whenever Evie hugged him or something. Like listen, I get that you\'re trying to attract the TikTok girlie pops, and that the majority read smut or fantasy that has smut in it, but if you know that you\'re book doesn\'t have any smut in it, don\'t try a market to them, it\'s okay, there are other people who will enjoy this book! It\'s just not for them! But it weird when you try and gain this audience through deception... it\'s not like you can allude to this and magically edit the book after its been mass printed.I would like to end this scathing review off with that I genuinely believe that this book had so much potential in it and the idea for it was fantastic. It needed help with the characters mostly and their relationship. I also believe that had this book been YA I personally would have found it so good. I just think this book was trying to hard to be a TikTok star when not every book written know has to be catered to Booktok.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Read this if you want an honest review by someone who didn’t even know this author was on TikTok or whatever even though I checked and I guess I follow her? I had no idea….anyway, here it is:I was having fun, and then I was just annoyed.I even rec’d this book to friends before the halfway mark which I don’t normally do but it was such an interesting beginning and it was kind of refreshing in its oddball weirdness.But that schtick is really old by the 70 percent mark and that’s where I’m stopping.This reads like Howl’s Moving Castle fanfiction in the style of a Korean romantic comedy series if that series was 300 episodes long with 265 of those being filler episodes about making coffee.The dramatic slipping on a piece of paper and landing in the MMC’s arms? The looooooooong moon eyed stares and the barely touching hands before jerking away in embarrassment? Yeah it’s all in there.I thought this book was for adults and I was fine with the slow burn until I realized I’d gotten pretty close to the end and they hadn’t grown any closer than two awkward kids at their first middle school dance.The plot (if it exists) is not strong enough to support this book without a little bolstering from a decent romance and, though this had ton of potential, the romance in this book is starting to wilt before it has bloomed. I don’t need spice, but I do need grown adults to stop acting like hormonal teenagers. It’s giving second hand embarrassment at this point.And let’s get into the weird dialogue and the erratic pacing. Some of the jokes were so weird and awkward I didn’t even realize they were jokes until one of the characters laughed uproariously…it was like this book had a laugh track.And then something mundane would be said and a character would weirdly overreact in offense or confusion or awe…whatever it was it would be too over the top for whatever was said.It was cringy and confusing and kept taking me out of the story. There were even times when only half a sentence would be said and the rest of the characters in the scene would all dramatically look at each other and “nod knowingly” or something and I would not know what the fuck was happening. It felt like being on the outside of a thousand inside jokes.And THEN…why is this Villain basically running an office? I don’t get it. And I’ve seen reviews saying you need to watch the TikTok series and that’s just annoying. What’s the point of a book if you have to watch a video to truly understand it? That is asinine.And with such a huge staff on board how the hell doesn’t everyone in the whole realm know where this guy runs his operation? Everyone just clocks out and leaves at night? They have weekends off? What the hell? The more that was written about this situation the worse it got. What kind of villain is this?Ugh. I could literally go on and on as this long review is just the tip of the iceberg. I am at 70 percent and I can already see some “amazing plot twist” is about to happen and I care so little that I am shutting the book forever. 🤷🏼\u200d♀️And I have learned my lesson and will not be telling my friends to read a book before I myself have finished it from now on.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Dear god, this seems so controversial!I had no idea this was such a love-it-or-hate-it book when I downloaded it. I had just kind of seen the cover about the place and it was one of the few audiobooks I could snag without a wait.So.It was cute in that Hallmark movie/Lifetime romance kind of way.You know what I mean?Like, the dialogue isn't all that good but the couple is cute and you want to see if the lady who bakes Christmas cookies for a living will be able to free the spirit of the hot ghost who's trapped in the inn she's staying in for the duration of her time in her hometown as she visits her overbearing but well-meaning mother?I KNOW I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE SITTING ON MY COUCH WITH A GLASS OF WINE AND A BAG OF FUNYUNS WATCHING THIS SHIT.Also, when I sawvillainin the title, I just assumed it was like a superhero villain.Not so!What we have here is more of afairytalevillain. Except he's less like that Skeltor-looking guy from The Black Cauldron and more like Hiddelson's Loki.So even though he's evil, he's the hot version of evil, and I think we can all pull out our bag of Funyuns, pop the cork on that $8 bottle of Members Mark wine, and settle into our seats for that one.The short version?Our heroine needs a job to support her sick father and little sister, and due to plot, she runs into the terrifying villain known as THE VILLAIN whilst rambling in the woods.Naturally, he offers her a job. <--why else are we here, people?Her special brand of optimism, humor, and inability to fear him turns his crusty heart to mush, and away we go on our journey into an adorable little romance.And honestly, the plot is cute, too. There's a whole evil castle filled with interesting minions, while the good guys in this are pretty sketchy and suspect.But make no mistake, this is pretty B-movie when it comes to the writing.I just happen to like cheesy romance movies.As for the audiobook, the narration isterrible. It. is. bad.I will say that the narrator does the voices well, especially the male voices (not all female narrators can do that) but all the descriptive dialogue is stilted as hell. This is the second narrator that I've noticed doing this exact. same. thing. and I'm now wondering if this is something they're beingtoldto do? It sounds like an especially bad version of AI is reading all the non-speaking parts. I DNF'd the (the other book) because it was so off-putting, so it says something about the cuteness of the story that I hung in there for this.I stole thisaudio linkfromRobin (Bridge Four)'s Reviewbecause I think you should take a listen before you decide whether or not you can handle it.Recommended for those of us who inhale corny romance.""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'ohhhhh this was BADFire the editor.

Overall, it was pretty good for a debut novel. While it had its moments, I thought it was quite forgettable. So let\'s dive into the things I liked and didn\'t like:What I liked:The romance premise was cute.I\'m a huge fan of the grumpy x sunshine trope and thought it was a fun, fresh idea to portray this in a fantasy world with a boss x assistant dynamic.The Villain was the most interesting character.And I like that we slowly learn about his background and motive throughout the story. I\'m glad some of the chapters were from his POV but honestly wish there had been more. Also, he calls Evie \'little tornado\' and that was super cute.What really surprised me in the best way possible was the mystery plot that ended with an insane twist and cliffhanger ending!I truly did not see any of that coming, and honestly, it was the most interesting thing about the book. The ending alone might have made me pick up the next book, if it weren\'t for some of my points below.What I didn\'t liked:It was alluded to that this story would be adult. However, it reads more YA.I guess if you think gore and cursing automatically puts a book in the adult genre, then yeah, this is adult. But since it\'s marketed as a romantasy, I was expecting spice, when in fact, there is none. It was just incredibly frustrating and boring reading about adult characters who like each other from the beginning of the story but refuse to admit they like each other. There were so many moments when the tension was high and I thought something would happen but then . . . nothing. I mean, there is a kiss, but even that wasn\'t done with a romantic purpose. It sometimes felt forced not having anything physical happen between Evie and the Villain.So is this a romantasy? No, it\'s really a fantasy with elements of romance. I think there should have been a quicker progression of the romance and a little bit of spice (like at least a hardcore make-out session or some heavy petting after putting us through 340 pages of them fighting their attraction), and since that didn\'t happen, there should have been more suspense and drama with the mystery plot.Okay, let\'s talk about the world building.What we were given was adequate, but it was kind of generic and there wasn\'t a lot of depth. Honestly, the entire world is forgettable. I honestly can\'t tell you which kingdom or the town this takes place in or the name of the Villain\'s home (which is mentioned a bunch). I was reading for the romance but the romance was boring, and the world building wasn\'t interesting enough, so unfortunately it all just sort of fell flat.This book was also supposed to be \'laugh out loud\' funny, when in reality, I didn\'t laugh once.I might have awkwardly cringe out of embarrassment for some of the characters but sadly, the humor wasn\'t my cup of tea. If anything, I found the Villain to be a bit funny - with his unpleasant, gruff replies and standoffish demeanor - whenever he interacted with Evie. But again, it was never lol kind of funny.I get that Evie is meant to be this sunshine assistant, but did she have to come across so ditsy and annoying?She was just very child-like in her interactions with people, and was sort of in her own little bubble. And then whenever she thought, ""He should scare me but doesn\'t. . . huh I wonder what that means"" (and she thinks this A LOT), I couldn\'t help but roll my eyes. First off, this makes her seem like an idiot. And second, at this point the author is just holding the readers hand here, which is super irritating.This book sometimes felt disjointed with the office shenanigans or Evie and the Villains random interactions.I don\'t know if I can quite explain this, but there were just a few instances I thought, ""Hmmm this seems unnecessary but maybe this was done to create a small, comical or awkward situation the MCs will have the deal navigate through."" Like when we find out the Villain sleeps with a nightlight because he\'s afraid of the dark? First off, ew, that\'s unattractive. And second, this is just another situation where the story felt more like YA versus adult.Look, regardless of the things I didn\'t like, the book was fine. I read it in one sitting and survived. There wasn\'t a lot of substance and it was definitely too long, but I didn\'t want to throw the book across the room or set it on fire. So it is at least entertaining enough and readable. But do I want to read it again? No. Do I want to continue the series? Unfortunately, no. But I do want to read a summary of what happens next. Would I recommend this to you? Maybe, if you want to read a low-stakes fantasy where nothing important happens for 80% of the book. It\'s not bad, but there\'s definitely better books out there I would prefer to spend time on.Thank you Red Tower Books for providing an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review!

Mommy is always a sucker for mmc\'s inner thoughts.And the humor is so good, too!Assistant to the Villain is a book you can devour in a single sitting and have all the fun while doing it.It reminded me a little ofThe Paper Magician, especially the relationship between Evie and The Villain.I\'ve got to admit, though, I loved the latter more. Their chemistry and reciprocal respect gave me all the feels, which is huge, considering they barely kiss once.Evie is an adorable little clumsy cinnamon roll, but the kind that would kill you, and I love her for it. I saw a lot of myself in her, especially her work ethic and efficiency.Trystan, our Villain, is an exquisite example of broody mmc, and it\'s always a pleasure reading about him lighting up because of Evie.The list of secondary characters is abundant and varied, and each of them left an impression.And did I mention there\'s a pet dragon named Fluffy, and Kingsleythe toad who speaks via communication signs??The workplace interactions between Evie, Trystan and co, were definitely my favorite part.Plotwise speaking, there\'s some sort of mystery element you get to unravel along with the main characters, but it didn\'t always keep me entertained.Some moments were unfortunately a little boring, not to mention confusing. I also had a bit of trouble fully understanding the Villain\'s motives for vengeance and his feud with the King.They both seemed to lack vigor, if you get what I mean.I also wished the author spent a few more paragraphs explaining the world\'s magic system. The fact that, in this universe, people possess magic, sort of popped out of nowhere and I wasn\'t expecting it.Not that it wasn\'t appreciated, but it hadn\'t been mentioned till that moment and nothing let me believe they did before that, so I had to pause for a minute and think back to what I\'d already read while keeping this notion in mind.Despite these little bumps on the road, I can without a doubt claim this as one of my favorite reads of the year.Can\'t wait to find out what\'s going to happen in the sequel.Bravo, Hannah Nicole Maehrer! I\'ll definitely keep an eye out for her works, now and in the future.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""dnf @ 60%If you liked this book, I'm happy for you, but I was honestly bored to death and didn’t laugh once.I know I’m in the minority here, and I really wanted to love it, but I just couldn’t get into it. I honestly don’t know how I made it as far as I did—every page felt like a chore.The plot was so boring, it barely held my attention, and I couldn’t care less about where it was going. It wasn’t even remotely funny to me and I couldn't connect with any of the characters. Maybe it’s a personal thing, but the humour just fell flat. The jokes didn’t land, and it all felt forced.The writing was probably the biggest turn off for me, though—it felt like something I would’ve read back in middle school, really basic, unrefined, and lacking any depth or sophistication. I should’ve trusted my gut and dnfed after the prologue, honestly. That part was a struggle, and I should’ve known it wasn’t going to get better.I know I’m in the minority, but this book just wasn’t for me.______________I’ve been really curious to read this because it’s been all over my TikTok feed for ages, and it seems like a lot of fun!""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '‘She was the personal assistant to The Villain, after all. She chuckled at the job title, imagining the ridiculous way the employment posting would appear in a news pamphlet.Must be well organized. Must enjoy working late nights and relish writing long documents. Must be comfortable and even supportive of arson, torture, murder. And must not scream when there is an occasional dead body lying across your desk.’Assistant to the Villain by Hannah Nicole Maehrer is a delightful twist on the fantasy genre, blending humor, adventure, and a dash of romance into a refreshingly unique story. The novel centers on Evie Sage, an ordinary assistant with a not so ordinary boss, an infamous and misunderstood villain known as ""The Villain.""Maehrer masterfully creates a world where the lines between good and evil blur, and where the characters are richly developed and multifaceted. Evie, the protagonist, is endearing and relatable. Her sharp wit and determined spirit make her an engaging guide through the story\'s twists and turns. The Villain, on the other hand, is a complex character, whose menacing reputation is offset by moments of vulnerability and unexpected kindness.The book\'s strength lies in its clever dialogue and the dynamic between Evie and the Villain. Their interactions are laced with sarcasm, humor, and a surprising level of emotional depth. Maehrer\'s writing shines in these moments, making the characters\' growth and evolving relationship feel genuine and compelling.The plot is fast paced and filled with a mix of action, intrigue, and heartwarming moments. The humor is a standout feature, with Maehrer balancing light heartedness and tension expertly.Assistant to the Villain is a charming and witty read that offers a fresh take on the fantasy genre. Hannah Nicole Maehrer\'s debut novel is a testament to her talent for creating memorable characters and an immersive world.It’s a perfect pick for those who enjoy a blend of humor, adventure, and a touch of romance in their fantasy reads.

But all of those characters simply pale in comparison to kingsley. a sassy little frog wearing a crown who communicates by holding up signs with words on them?? he was literally the cutest, funniest, best character. Kingsley stan foreverrr <3₊˚❀.ೃ the romance ࿔*:･classic grumpy x sunshine romance!! again, a bit cliché but it’s all in the name of a good time. this one wasn’t exactly enemies-to-lovers, as they were attracted to each other from the start, but it didn’t feel insta-lovey at all. they had the cutest little moments, when they hugged for like ten minutes! I almost died 🥺💗 I cannot wait for more of them inapprentice to the villain!!₊˚❀.ೃ the writing ࿔*:･this was my one problem with the book (I can hear you all collectively groaning. I’m sORRY I’m just very nitpicky with writing styles). it wasextremelycorny and kind of told, instead of showed. I still enjoyed the book, but it did have me considering the quality of hannah's editor.overall, it wasn’t a constant problem, just sometimes, and it was still a fun narrative. one other little thing that I noticed was the amount of cussing. I’m fine with some, but it was not only unnecessary, it felt forced. I don’t know if the author felt some kind of need to make this seem more “adult” by adding a bunch of f-bombs, but it wasn’t needed. not a huge deal, but it bothered me.₊˚❀.ೃ the plot ࿔*:･so much fun! dragons and other mythical beasts galore. The world had a very classic fairytale-esque feel to it; the fantasy villain, the foreboding castle in the woods where he lives, innocent little village, etc. it was a little underdeveloped, but I loved the nostalgic old-disney vibe it had.I was expecting this book to be mainly romance with some random half-baked plot, but it was actually quite good and there was an excellent plot twist. not to mention the cliffhanger! that was straight up rude. I will be waiting very anxiously for the next book 🙁₊˚❀.ೃ ࿔*:･was this cheesy and kind of ridiculous? of course, but that's half the fun!

The concept has always seemed so intriguing to me, but I've waited to be in the mood for something lighthearted and funny with fantasy elements.This definitely delivered aspects of that, however overall I didn't really get what I expected, so starting off the mood clashed quite a bit. It took me an awfully long time to get into it.(Not even exaggerating, I think only I fully got into it around the 80% mark.)Throughout the entire book I definitely had moments I enjoyed that went by undisturbed, but just as fast the book lost me.It felt a bit like I was trying to latch on to these moments, trying to get into the story but as soon as a new chapter started I felt like I had to start afresh.The flow of the book wasn't cohesive and simply felt choppy to me. This might be a stylistic choice to build on the quirky fmc, or get that 'The Office'-feel where you're just dropped into a new setting with very little context, but it more often than not just simply lost me hence why it took me so long to get through this book.✧Her brows knitting together as she realized this dress might be what she was buried in if she wasn’t careful tonight. She sighed. At least it was sparkly.✧I'm not gonna talk too much about the last 20% because I don't wanna spoil anything, but damnthat was good.

I'm also proud seeing her development in confidence from the start of the book to the ending.✧She wasn’t light; she was color. Every single one, dancing otherworldly and bright over his unworthy eyes.✧That together with the incredible chemistry between The Villain and Evie is why I still feel like I can rate this with 3 stars. Their dynamic is honestly why I got through this book. I ate up every single one of their scenes like I was starving.Trystan's perspective on Evie, his silent, begrudging affection and obsession was absolutely everything. If it weren't for them I know I would likely not pick up the next book, but I need to see how they play out.✧He’d enjoy it, and try to hold this memory in his heart until the day of his inevitable horrific death, which wouldn’t matter because he’d gotten to hold her.✧idk if this review makes any sense or if I'm just blabbing, ty for reading it though<3____________⌞Pre-read:⌝This has been circulating a lot in my feed the last few days, and seems people are really enjoying it??

I needed it like yesterday.➥writingthis book was written in such afunny and lightway, making me laugh so many times! while there were some minor things I sometimes didn\'t reallyyyy like (like a repetitive word), it was still very easy tobingeread and I especially loved the descriptions of how the magic looked.in addition, I loved that there were two point of views!➥charactershow is it that i already love so many of these characters when I\'ve only just met them?!! thank you, HNM, for creating such amazing people.I can\'t get enough ofevie. she\'s so so sweet, clumsy and bubbly and made me smile often. heroptimism paired with her humour and sarcastic remarksmade meand the villainlove her instantly!sadly, she\'s often burdened by her traumatic past, yet she\'s still able to smile. she has to be a parent for her little sister while she herself never really had one, which shows what astrong womanshe is.additionally,she\'s also got a ""dark"" side to her. she doesn\'t fear the evil things the villain does and does some k1ll1ng herself(only those who deserve it, she\'s not weird!!), especially at the end. I really hope I\'ll see more if this side in the next book since it\'s exciting to see her ""evil"". she was a greatembodiment of ""female rage""at the ending!same as evie, I\'ve fallen forthe villain. firstly, if anyone is worried about him being called the villain in the whole book (I was) : don\'t worry, he\'s got ahotnormal name as well!!when I tell y\'allthis man is amazing, I\'m telling the truth. he\'s the perfect morally grey, hot character, who has a soft spot for the female main character. he\'s so stubborn but then slowly melts, which was adorable to read about.he too has a traumatic past, which I feel like I don\'t know that much about yet, soI\'m looking forward to getting to know him on a deeper level, especially because I\'m excited for some explanations about why he became the villain.Kingsley, Blade and other side characterswere such a great addition to the book. i really like them all. also - am i seeing a potential for a side character relationship (or maybe even a spin-off?) between blade and Becky? I hope so hihi they\'d be so cute.➥evie and the villainthey are everything and more and exactly what i mean when I say sunshine X grumpy. I can\'t get enough of them.I didn\'t even get more than only one kiss, which can\'t really be counted as one- y\'all read that right, NOT EVEN MORE THAN ONE (1) KISS. and i love it because there\'s sooo muchpotential for an amazing slow (not super slow but like they have to become a bit more friends yet and then there could really happen something) burn.their chemistry is so good.the lingering looks, the ""accidental"" touches, the touching each other a second longer than necessary, the trusting each other with their traumas, the bickering and sarcastic comments, the touch her and you die - i got it all.moreover, the way they think about each other???!!? people died. they are SO cute and SO in love with each other. especially the way the villain thinks about her - he describes her with such beautiful words and compares her to the sunlight and to colours, calling her adorable nicknames.➥conclusionI\'m so glad I picked this up! it\'s such a feel-good, comforting book that\'s super addictive.I can\'t wait for the next book!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Have I read it?

Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass, #3)
",Sarah J. Maas,4.46,1149002,5270,"Young Adult, Romance, Fantasy, Fiction, Magic, Fae, Young Adult Fantasy",576,02-09-2014,"Celaena has survived deadly contests and shattering heartbreak-but at an unspeakable cost. Now, she must travel to a new land to confront her darkest truth . . . a truth about her heritage that could change her life-and her future-forever. Meanwhile, brutal and monstrous forces are gathering on the horizon, intent on enslaving her world. Will Celaena find the strength to not only fight her inner demons, but to take on the evil that is about to be unleashed?","[{'rating': 5, 'content': '""Enemy. Lover.Queen.""Heir of Fireis undoubtedly one of the best books I\'ve ever read. It certainly will be my favorite book of the year. It is gloriously long and kept me occupied for an entire day (night hours included) making me crave to find out more, but also stop reading so that the book won\'t end just yet.You think you know Celaena from reading the first two books, right? Oh, but you\'re so so wrong. In this book we see her more than broken, relentlessly blaming herself for the fates and deaths of her beloved ones. She takes down her every shield, leaving nothing behind to shed her emptiness threatening to shatter her from the inside out. I believe this was her turning point, the true crossroad in her life, making her see, accept and embrace all that pain, regret and self-loathing she carefully kept hidden inside her soul, etched into her dire and gruesome memories.“You collect scars because you want proof that you are paying for whatever sins you\'ve committed. And I know this because I\'ve been doing the same damn thing for two hundred years. Tell me, do you think you will go to some blessed Afterworld, or do you expect a burning hell? You\'re hoping for hell--because how could you face them in the Afterworld?”And gods, what memories and past. We are able to witness how she became Celaena Sardothien, how her life changed forever on that fateful night ten years ago. But by facing all that sorrow and darkness, she\'s making a stand. She\'s slowly becoming a queen, one more powerful and deadlier that you could ever imagine.Her character development is phenomenal, because through her new experiences she is stronger, wiser and more determined. Her fierceness was awe-inspiring and I loved that she\'s still the same stubborn, snarky and brave young woman, maybe with her ego a little bruised. She\'s not proud of who she\'s become, abandoning her kingdom and not fighting for rebuilding it for the past ten years, but she\'s ready to throw herself into battle to win back her land. To say that she\'s badass would be an understatement.Celaena makes the transition from assassin to queen with the help of Rowan, a Fae Prince and my favorite new addition to the series. Not that he is so eager to help, but in order to find answers about the Wyrdkeys and how to destroy them, she has to be worthy of entering Doranelle, the land where Queen Maeve awaits her to answer her questions. May I shout something?I LOVE ROWAN WHITETHORN. In the beginning, he\'s infuriatingly patient and stubborn, brooding and secretive. But when he opens up? And when he actuallysmiles?!?Laughs?? Scrap me off the floor cause I am hyperventilating.“Gods, he was brilliant. Cunning and wicked and brilliant.Even when he beat the hell out of her. Every. Damn. Day.”He\'s an alpha-male in all his glory, with the kickass moves that would bring Celaena\'s to shame. He\'s scary and intense, protective and defying, caring, but lethal when it comes to his enemies. Rowan is the no-nonsense type and I was glad there is finally someone who doesn\'t put up with Celaena\'s bullshit. She throws a verbal punch? He throws one that will leave her with a black eye for the entire week. But they develop a friendship and something so important on the intimate level (not talking about romance) that it will warm your heart to realize that our girl finally has someone to fully rely on. No secrets, no barriers, no judging left between them. They would die for each other, kill for each other, fight for each other. And when they work together, as a pair, as a team, they\'re astounding and terrifying.“I claim you, Rowan Whitethorn. I don\'t care what you say and how much you protest. I claim you as my friend.”Dorian Havilliard is the same swoon-worthy, sentimental, humble (yet a bit arrogant as well) young prince. He will win your heart regardless of the ""team"" you\'re in, because in the end he stands up to his father in a glorious way that had me cheering for him. He is way more mature, weary of everyone and everything and you can see him becoming a true worthy king right before your eyes. A lot of heartbreak and despair was in store for him and I guarantee it will all leave you in a pile of overwhelming feels.In addition to his wonderful character development, Dorian is moving on from Celaena. And I\'m not sure I like who he\'s moving on with. Heck, I don\'t like that he\'s actually moving on. Makes the whole Dorian/Celaena shipping a bit harder. But truth be told now, as much as I was against his new lady Sorscha, I was glad he got a little happiness and support to fight his growing loneliness, worries and magic. And you want to know why? Because freaking Chaol Westfall pretty much abandoned his friend when he needed him the most.Yeah, you read that right. Dedicated, loyal, selfless Chaol was so unable to make up his damn mind that I was uncounsciously pulling my hair. I was very much irritated with him until the very end when he came to his senses. In the aftermath ofCrown of Midnight, his friendship with Dorian is left in shambles and things don\'t get prettier in this book. They grow estranged, but I\'ll give it to the captain that he has only the prince\'s safety and freedom in interest. But keeping secrets, judging, not being able to accept Celaena\'s and Dorian\'s powers -- all these things make me wonder if he has any shot left at our heroine\'s heart, because whereas Celaena would always pick him, Aelin would not.“As for Celaena,” he said again, “ you do not have the right to wish she were not what she is. The only thing you have a right to do is decide whether you are her enemy or her friend.”We meet awesome warrior Aedion Ashryver, Celaena\'s cousin and childhood best friend. He\'s all deadly smiles, muscles and wild behavior. Aedion is daring, clever and doesn\'t give a rat\'s ass about anyone but himself. Or so they say. But he\'s dead set on taking down the King of Adarlan from the inside. When he finds out Aelin is alive, he makes it clear that he would move mountains in order to see his true queen back in Terrasen. He\'s loyal, determined, skilled and I hope he reunites with Celaena sooner rather than later, because he is in a pretty bad place at the end of the book.""A cry went up from the witches, save for the Thirteen—¬who stayed cool and quiet. They did not need to cheer, for they ¬were immortal and infinite and gloriously, wonderfully deadly.”Another addition to the newbie characters is Manon Blackbeak, heir of the Blackbeak coven of the Ironteeth witches and leader of the Thirteen. The witches play a big role in the King\'s newest and darkest plans by being the riders of the wyverns he has created and Manon wants nothing more than to lead them into battle as Wing Leader. She wants to prove herself and although she is a bloodthirsty, wicked creature, I completely loved her. She\'s by no means a villain, just a different kind of heroine, firm and unyielding, with great ambition. Her encounters and silent dialogues with Abraxos cracked me up, because in that moments you could glimpse (besides the wyvern\'s total awesomeness) how Manon starts believing there\'s a chance she has a heart and soul and that her grandmother\'s rules might not be the best to follow.“Witches didn\'t need blood to survive, but humans didn\'t need wine, either.”The King of Adarlan is still the biggest bastard I\'ve had the (dis)pleasure of reading. I loathe the guy with every fiber of my being. He is wicked to the core, manipulative and selfish to no end. No, not just selfish, but greedy. Greedy for everything and anything, exactly like a monster. And what he did at the end, to my poor baby Dorian, made me wish that once Celaena comes back -- because she will come back -- she won\'t kill him. Oh no, I want her to keep him locked in a basement, to visit him everyday and torture him until he breaks, only to do it all over again the next day, because killing him would be too much of a mercy for the deeds he has done.The other secondary characters were very well developed: the Ironteeth witches, Ren Allsbrook, Emrys, Luca and Maeve -- they were a testimony to SJM\'s awesome writing skills. And I might add that for me the writing style was slightly different. Improved. Better. More realistic, if you wish. There was a certain ease with which she used words that enchanted you completely. Plus, the swearing. I don\'t mind it one bit, but am I the only one that noticed it appeared more often than in the first two books? Matured characters, matured world, matured language, I guess.The atmosphere is darker and the pace is thrilling, allowing you to breath for a bit before another near-death encounter or epic battle starts. The world-building was another winner, as we were able to see Wendlyn, Doranelle, the Ferien Gap and Adarlan again. We learn about the past, we meet Queen Maeve (who\'s quite a manipulative bitch), we run from terrifying creatures and we accompany Celaena as she masters her powers.There isn\'t so much romance in the air, besides Dorian\'s plotline, because it\'s the last thing in our character\'s mind. And honestly, I don\'t really know who Celaena is going to end up with. Chaol still has issues with her and Dorian is currently viewing her as his friend, but things could still drastically change since there are 3 more books. It seems that even Aedion, her cousin, might have a shot since he wouldn\'t deny anything his queen would ask of him. And then there\'s Rowan who I\'m not sure will actually have a romantic involvement with Aelin, but it\'s worth hoping for -- they would be unstoppable.“He would not apologize for today, or yesterday, or for any of it. And she would not ask him to, not now that she understood that in the weeks she had been looking at him it had been like gazing at a reflection. No wonder she had loathed him.”In terms of plot, you could say it\'s action-driven, but I beg to differ: the character development plays a part as big as the twists and turns and fights. It sure keeps you at the edge of your seat, courtesy of Sarah J. Mass\' amazing writing, and makes you shudder at some new evil creatures or at the violence, but I basically viewHeir of Fireas Celaena\'s healing journey, one necessary to fully accept her legacy.“So you’d save another land, but not yours. Why can’t your friend save her own kingdom?”“Because she is dead!” She screamed the last word so loudly it burned in her throat. “Because she is dead, and I am left with my worthless life!”TheThrone of Glassseries slowly becomes a younger version ofGame of Thrones(with less deaths, but keep in mind that there are worse fates than death...) and I couldn\'t be happier. With the same complexity, a gut-wrenching intensity and an amazing world,Heir of Firebrings out the big guns: twists, emotional punches, tearjerkers and amazing characters, not to mention the wonderfully built world. It\'s definitely the best one from the series yet and a total game-changer, so don\'t be surprised if it will keep you enthralled from start to finish. Fantasy to its finest, a story with heroes and monsters, Fae and humans, life and death. Read it the second it hits shelves, cause you won\'t be disappointed (unless you\'re the type that can\'t stomach the idea of enduring another year for the next book and to whom I recommend waiting a bit longer, because there is one hell of a cliff-hanger).If you\'re looking for anything ToG related then check out thisThrone of Glass fansite.ENJOY!<3'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5/5 ⭐Full review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolf🐺*stares blankly in space trying to think a way of living life now after this book destroyed me*I just don’t even know what can I say about this book. It’s like everything I try to say gets validated and discarded at the same time. It feels frustrating and I am still not going to cope with it any time soon.It is alwaysveryhard for me to write reviews for theThrone of Glassbooks. I mean, it is somehow impossible. I thoughtCrown of Midnightwas hard to write, but holy gods, I think this one beat it (I don’t even want to think in how many ways the rest of the series is going to murder me).A very important part of this book is Rowan Whitethorn, a Fae warrior prince who will initially seem the most obnoxious creature on earth, but until the end of this book, you’ll fall completely in love with him. His harshness and heart of stone are only the veils that cover Rowan’s true spirit – a gentle spirit; an honourable man with a true sense of loyalty.„Loyalty is earned, not given.”Another important part of the book is the apparition of Aelin’s long lost cousin, general Aedion Ashryver. His unshakable loyalty for his beloved cousin made him do atrocious things in the past ten years, but he still believes in Aelin’s return and is ready to sacrifice anything and everything to help her reign over her people, freeing them all, saving their lives.And if you thought I was done with important parts, you’re awfully wrong. There is yet another very important part of the book and that is the magnificent appearance of the Ironteeth witch Manon Blackbeak. I don’t know how this happened, maybe I am the only one, maybe I am the one of the few, maybe the one of the many, but I love Manon. I really do love her character and her story and it makes me feel so attached to her knowing all the wicked things she and her coven went through in order to become these lethal creatures, heartless and soulless. Let’s give a sister the appreciation she deserves!I am sorry to announce though that throughout the book the most boring of all characters had to be Chaol. I really am sorry, I actually skipped a couple of his chapters.Oops.Until the end of the book though, my heart got so warm with love for him and also for my pretty prince Dorian that I just couldn’t take it anymore. Don’t want to sound too much, but boy, Chaol and Dorian really turned out to be the real OTP of the whole bookand I am living for it.As you already know (and if you don’t let me enlight you), I have a tendency to infiltrate someRomanianismsin my reviews. I know I am the only one in this whole wide world to make connections between a book I read and my language and culture but IT IS TRUE AND IT REALLY GOES RIGHTin my heart.InHeir of Fire, there is a particular celebration going on on some point in Mistward and that one is called Beltane, which consists of bonfires being ignited at night for some brave people who are ready to jump across them for good luck and good lives. Here in Romania, we have this very same tradition (minus the music and the food, we only get sweets while attending). Our celebration is calledFocul lui Sumendru, a Romanian tradition who is two thousand years old and it pretty much is the same as Beltane, but as in book Beltane is held in spring, ourFocis held in autumn, in order to keep the autumn steady as long as it can, to belate the harsh winter. Pretty cool, yeah, but DO NOT TRY IT AT HOME!Okay, now that I’ve also opened the celebration discussion and also closed it I would very much like to mention that it is very imperious (if you allow me to say so) that youdo notread this book in public! It gets very emotional and if you are like me, then it is a very complicated job to contain yourself while reading it.Seriously, my face almost cracked while trying to repress a very unladylike word from getting out my throat.Also, for my Romanians - Have you ever experiencedFocul lui Sumendru?'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I\'m not sure what to say aboutHeir of Fire. Perhaps I don\'t need to say anything beyond:it took memonthsto read it.And I am the kind ofcrazypassionate reader that finishes good books in a day or two. It\'s been a while since a book took me longer than a week to read.So basically:I liked but had issues withThrone of Glass.I absolutely LOVEDCrown of Midnight.But this book... this book was so... bloody... sloooooowwwwwww.I wanted to DNF it so bad. I kept moving it between my ""currently reading"" and ""on hold"" shelves. I kept wondering if I could possibly just skip the last two thirds of this book and somehow pick the story up in next installment (I was informed that I could not). I have invested so much time and love in this series and these characters that I simply had to make myself finish... but holy shit, it was such a struggle.The majority of this book?So Maas tries to experiment with a bit of something different here and it neither a) works, nor b) fills me with much confidence for the state of the rest of the series. I\'m seeing the way this whole thing is going...Book one was fantasy-lite with a simplistic plot, filled with characters lacking in any real development to distinguish them from others in the genre, but it was fast-paced, sugary entertainment. Book two cranked it up several notches; here the characters became more fleshed out and nuanced, the plot was equally engaging but more complex and clever, and there was way more badassery. No complaints at all. And then we arrive at book three.Heir of Firefeels like an attempt to be more sophisticated. It is well-written, contains several stories told through constantly changing POVs, and it is more than a hundred pages longer. And it is far far slower. Maas sacrifices everything deliciously fast-paced and compelling about her series in the first half so we can be introduced to a whole new cast of characters we don\'t care about, be taken through different (all boring) perspectives, and emerge feeling like we\'ve read an extremely long filler book.Dorian\'s new romance only served to remind me why I found him unbearably boring in the first book. Celaena - now in Wendlyn - meets a whole set of new people who failed to make any kind of impression on me. Even Chaol - whom I absolutely loved in both other books - lost his charm somewhere amid his own boring plot line. And just when I thought I might be starting to get invested in one of the stories, the chapter would end and I would leave the story of interest for at least fifty pages, guaranteeing that I would no longer care when we finally returned.The most annoying thing about this book is how it wasn\'t even consistently slow. We\'d get tiny little tidbits of awesome that would last a mere two or three pages and I would sit up a bit straighter and think ""This is it. Finally we\'re getting to the good stuff..."" until I realised it was just a false alarm and the story was still boring.If I\'m to give credit where it\'s due, I will say that I like the way Maas portrays friendships and makes them as important - if not more important - than the romantic relationships. It\'s an area of YA so often neglected and I find it especially refreshing to see a platonic relationship between young male and female characters crafted so well.I will be reading the next book just because I have to give it a shot, but my expectations have been significantly lowered.Blog|Leafmarks|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Tumblr'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'SHE WOULD NOT BE AFRAID!!!!!!!!! 😭😭😭❤️\u200d🔥❤️\u200d🔥❤️\u200d🔥❤️\u200d🔥'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Sarah J Mass is a capital G God.

And tell you what? It actually exceeded my, admittedly, already high expectations! Yes, Sarah! You did an amazing job with this one! I was hooked right from the beginning and I didn’t want to stop to read this damn book!!!I loved this book, I loved it so freaking much! It was so, so, so, so, SOOO, good!!!And I was happy with it, I was SO happy with it!UNTIL…UNTILthe last 20 pages hit me!! ARGH!!! T_TI thought I’d be able to write about “Heir of Fire” without getting all too emotional but as it seems all my plans and good intentions just went out of the window. I can’t write about this book without getting emotional! I just can’t! It was too much!! That ending was too much!!! WHY?WHY THE FREAKIDY FREAKING HELL, SARAH!!!!????How could you do this to me??!!HOW?!I LOVE THIS BOOK!BUT I HATE THIS ENDING SO MUCH!I hate it,I love it,I hate that I love it,I love that I hate it!ADSFJKLMNÖ ADKFASLDFJASDKFASDK!*throws book against the wall**a second time**for good measure*Okay, I think I’m ready to continue now. *takes deep breath and collects herself*All right! Let’s do this!Just like with “Crown of Midnight” I won’t waste your time by writing about the plot. It’s way too complex to explain it without any spoilers and because of that, I guess it might be best if I just go for another round of “Keyword Boggle”!It was so much fun the last time around, wasn’t it? ;-PSo here I go: Celaena, Dorian, Chaol, Rowan, Aelin, Manon, Abraxos, Sorscha, The King, magic, faeries, witches, darkness, fire, ice, wind, a kitchen, a healer, an apartment, blood, murder, and let’s not forget about the black stones. XDI guess by now you could write your own book! *lol*We’re still speaking about Sarah’s book though, so I’ll head directly into the characters section and won’t keep you in suspense any longer.The characters:Do I still have to say it? Yes? Okay! Beware of my characters section because it’s known as the spoilery spoiler section of my reviews! Don’t read on, close your eyes, eat an ice, please think twice, I’m not nice, my reviews have spice. And spoilers, lots of spoilers, but you already know that or you wouldn’t have continued to read that bad rhyme! ;-PCelaena:”So you’d save another land, but not yours. Why can’t your friend save her own kingdom?”“Because she is dead!” She screamed the last word so loudly it burned in her throat. “Because she is dead, and I am left with my worthless life!”*sighs deeply* Oh, Celaena! How much pain does this poor girl have to endure? It hurt to read about her feelings after Nehemia’s death, it hurt to read how much she ached and wished she could have been someone else. That she could have saved her friend. That Nehemia would live instead of her. That Chaol would have trusted her. That he would have told her… Oh boy, Celaena’s heart was a black void of desperation and pain that only seemed to get worse before it even got a chance to get better. In the end it did get better though and I’m so happy about that! She finally found her inner strength and she accepted her heritage! Which is awesome, because I really can’t wait for her to kick some ass! *lol* Heaven knows the King’s behind is already a formidable target and please Sarah if there is any justice in your world you’ll let him burn for what he did!!! You’ll let him suffer for all the pain he caused!!! I can’t wait to see Celaena’s power unleashed! Guess the palace is going to be “hot stuff” soon! ;-P”He had chosen the king. Even though he’d claimed he loved her, he still loyally served that monster. Maybe she had been a fool for letting him in, for dreaming of a world where she could ignore the fact that he was captain to the man who had shattered her life again and again.””No, all she could see were the slaves she’d left behind, the ashy mountains and those mass graves they dug every day, the faces of her people, who had worked beside her – her people whom she had left behind. Whom she had let herself forget, had let suffer; who had prayed for salvation, holding out hope that someone, anyone would remember them.She had abandoned them – and she had been too late.””She would not let that light go out. She would fill the world with it, with her light – her gift. She would light up the darkness, so brightly that all who were lost or wounded or broken would find their way to it, a beacon for those who still dwelled in that abyss. It would not take a monster to destroy a monster – but light, light to drive out darkness.She was not afraid.”Chaol:”He was afraid of what they would do to his kingdom. Because this was still his kingdom. He was working for Dorian, not Aelin – not Aedion. And he didn’t know where all of this put him.”YESH! I know it was a long and hard way for Chaol but as it seems he’s finally on the right track! I loved that he began to question everything. He was so insecure and hurt that he had no other choice than to face his outlook on things and in the end this eventually forced him to see behind the kings carefully kept façade. Which is awesome, because I know deep down within him Chaol is a very good man!!! He was just completely oblivious to the fact that the served a monster! Still, I’m glad he decided for Dorian and I swear if Celaena and Chaol don’t do anything about this damn ending, I’m going to riot!!!! CHAOL you gotta help your Prince and rightful king!!!!”I will not turn my back on my kingdom or my prince,” Chaol snapped. “I will not fight in your army and slaughter my people. And I will not break my vow to my father.” His honor might very well be all he would have left after the end of this.Aedion was quiet long enough that Chaol got up to leave. But then the general said, “What would you have given – just to see her again?”Chaol couldn’t turn around as he said, “It doesn’t matter now.”Chaol kept his sword drawn. “I will not go to Anielle,” he growled. “And I will not serve you a moment longer. There is one true king in this room – there always has been. And he is not sitting on that throne.”Dorian:”Once Dorian might have already said something about it. But having magic, getting drawn into whatever mess Celaena was in, seeing that other world in the secret tunnels … all of that had changed everything. The best he could do these days was maintain a low profile – to keep his father or anyone else from looking too long in his direction.”WHY SARAH??!! WHYYYYY? *breaks down and sobs*Why do you have to use him as a human punching bag? Dorian is so decent and compassionate; he doesn’t deserve to be broken!!! First you hurt him by finding out about Chaol’s and Celaena’s secret, then you kill off his girlfriend and in the end you even let him be forced into the Kings slavery!!??LIKE SERIOUSLY!!?? WTFH!!?? WTF!!?? I CAN’T WITH THIS ENDING!!! I JUST CAN’T!!! HE SUFFERED ENOUGH!!!I don’t even want to know what is going to happen now that he’s wearing this freaking collar! He saved Chaol’s life! GODDAMNIT!!! GIVE MY BOY A BREAK!!! Sarah, I swear it here and now if Dorian isn’t saved by the end of book 4 I won’t continue to read this series. I just won’t! I know it’s the author’s right and decision to kill off characters or to make them suffer as they please, but I just can’t take it anymore. Dorian is my cutiepie and cinnamon roll and I think my heart hurts enough! I survived 3 books of ACOTAR watching how my precious Lucien went through hell and I just can’t take this anymore. Lucien never got his happily ever after and it still hurts!!! So no, sorry but no! If Dorian isn’t at least halfway alright after “Queen of Shadows” then I’m quitting this series! Period! I made up my mind! There was so much potential to give Dorian’s character a chance to evolve and to be awesome and interesting! So much raw magic that could have been used, but all that happened was that Sorscha died and Dorian sacrificed himself for Chaol. I’m pissed, I’m majorly pissed! And coming from me that means a lot! So yeah, this wrong is better set right or I’m quitting! I’m serious and I mean it! This said:#TeamDorian forever and for always!!! <333”He’d been a fool once, swearing he would tear the world apart for Celaena. A boy in love with a wildfire – or believing he was in love with one.””Because you’re not really scared of those things, are you? No – it’s what they represent. The change. But let me tell you,” Dorian breathed, his magic flickering and then subsiding in a flash of pain, “things have already changed. And changed because of you. I have magic – there is no undoing that, not getting rid of it. And as for Celaena …” He clamped down on the power that surged as he imagined – for the first time, he realized – what it was to be her. “As for Celaena,” he said again, “you do not have the right to wish she were not what she is. The only thing you have a right to do is decide whether you are her enemy or her friend.””We’re all risking something.” There was so little of the friend he’d grown up with. The prince glanced at his pocket watch. “I need to go.” Dorian stalked to the stairs, and there was no fear in his face, no doubt, as he said, “You gave me the truth today, so I’ll share mine: even if it meant us being friends again, I don’t think I would want to go back to how it was before – who I was before. And this …” He jerked his chin towards the scattered crystals and the bowl of water. “I think this is a good change, too. Don’t fear it.”Aedion Ashryver:”Handsome was a light way of describing what Aedion was. Overwhelming was more like it. Towering and heavily muscled, Aedion was every inch the warrior rumor claimed him to be.”I like Aedion! I like him a lot!!! He’s such a tortured soul and he tried everything possible in order to protect his people! He was an intriguing new character and I can’t wait to see more of him. I really liked his interactions with Dorian because they were so much fun! *lol* Those two have a lot of potential to become close friends, but I guess the ending of this book kind of nullified that possibility. Still, I want Aedion’s noble and brave soul to be rescued as well and I don’t even want to know what the king is going to do with him. T_T I hope Aelin returns soon because her boys definitely need her right now! Poor Aedion, he waited for so long!!! And if I’m already at it! He saved Chaol’s ass too, so Chaol better get his groove on! He needs to make plans to save him as well! XD”Cousin – that had been his most beloved title. Cousin, kin, protector. Those were the secret names he harboured deep within, the names he whispered to himself when the northern wind was shrieking through the Staghorns.””Aelin would come back from Wendlyn, no matter what the captain believed. Aelin would come back, and when she did … With every breath, Aedion felt that lingering scent wrapping tighter around his heart and soul. When she came back, he was never letting her go.””All you monsters can burn in hell. Because my queen is coming – and she will spike you to the walls of your godsdamned castle. And I can’t wait to help her gut you like the pig you are.” He spat at the king’s feet, right on top of the fake ring that had stopped bouncing.Rowan:”She noticed then that his arms were bandaged, and more bandages across his broad chest peeked up from beneath his shirt. She’d burned him again. And yet he had held on to her – had run all the way here and not let go once.”The fierce, broody and intense warrior! I like him even though I have to admit that his abilities as a teacher kind of lack experience. *lol* Still, he’s a decent fae and despite the way he acted at the beginning of the book his heart actually seems to be in the right place. I loved that he took care of Celaena once he realised why she’s so broken and I suppose their fight at the beginning was kind of necessary. They both needed to let off some steam. XD I genuinely hope we’ll see more of him in the next book, because I feel like there is so much more to tell! ;-)”How – how did you come back from that kind of loss?”“I didn’t. For a long while I couldn’t. I think I’m still … not back. I might never be.”She nodded, lips pressed tight, and glanced toward the window.“But maybe,” he said, quietly enough that she looked at him again. He didn’t smile, but his eyes were inquisitive. “Maybe we could find the way back together.”Manon:Silent as death, Manon slid up behind him. The fool didn’t even know she was there until she brought her mouth close to his ear and whispered, “Wrong kind of witch.”I’M IN LOVE WITH MANON BLACKBEAK!!!This woman is so savage and fierce! I love it! *lol* As it seems for once my prayers were answered! I got more of the iron teeth witches and I loved every single chapter! XD Manon is so damn amazing! I just couldn’t get enough of her and followed her storyline closely. Truth be told, I just want to lean back and watch how her and Abraxos change the world. Haha! I disliked Manon’s grandmother a lot though and even though she became Wing Leader I’m pretty sure there will be some major estrangement in the future. Still, I loved Manon’s connection with Asterin and her Thirteen and I really hope they’ll always be at her side. Maybe Petrah will join them one day? Idk! I truly hope she’ll be fine some day because I really liked her too. >_<”You’re mine,” Manon said to him.The wyvern blinked at her, Titus’s blood still dripping from his cracked and broken teeth, and Manon had the feeling that he had come to the same decision. Perhaps he had known long before tonight, and his fight with Titus hadn’t been so much about survival as it had been a challenge to claim her.As his rider. As his mistress. As his.””And Manon, because no one was watching, because she did not care, flung out her arms as well and savoured the freefall, the wind now a song in her ears, in her shriveled heart.””You touch him again,” Manon said, “and I’ll drink the marrow from your bones.”The friendships & ships:Chaol & Dorian:He met Dorian’s gaze. There was nothing kind in it. But Dorian said, “I’m trying, Chaol.”Trying, because Chaol’s not consulting him on the plan to get Celaena out of Adarlan had been a breach of trust, and one that shamed him, though Dorian could never know that, either. “I know.”Oh, those two broke my heart! I really wanted them to solve their problems and then this damn ending came along!!! ARGH! They need a chance to fix all this! Sarah give them a chance, please!? They deserve it! AndOMG Chaol told Dorian that he loves him!!!Way too late but he did it!!! <33 I just want my two boys to be happy and friends again. *sobs* They both suffered enough in those last two books, they really deserve some peace!!! And to take away their chance to make amends!! So mean, Sarah! So, so mean!!! >_<”You think I’d run to my father?” The words were barely more than a strangled whisper as the temperature plummeted.Chaol stepped forward, putting himself between Aedion and Dorian, his palms exposed. Placating. “I can’t afford to guess – to hope. Even with you.””You cannot pick and choose what parts of her to love.” He pitied Chaol, he realized. His heart hurt for his friend, for all that Chaol had surely been realizing these past few months. “Just as you cannot pick which parts of me you accept.””He looked at his friend, perhaps for the last time, and said what he had always known, from the moment they’d met, when he’d understood that the prince was his brother in soul. “I love you.” Dorian merely nodded, eyes still blazing, and lifted his hands again towards his father. Brother. Friend. King.Sorscha & Dorian:”She usually talked like this when she was nervous. Which, Dorian had noticed with some satisfaction, was when he came near. And not in a bad way – if he’d sensed that she was truly uncomfortable, he’d have kept his distance. This was more … flustered. He liked flustered.”I suppose their relationship was doomed right from the beginning but I still would have liked it to work out. They were so sweet together, but I can’t shake the feeling that I missed some major parts of their plot. I really wish Sarah would have given us more of them because to me their entire storyline felt kinda rushed. Still, I was glad Sorscha helped Dorian to hide his magic and her being a spy was such an unexpected plot twist. >_< It really killed me when the King ordered her death and I can’t even describe how much Dorian’s pain hurt me! T_T I’m still not over this… probably I’ll never be!”Yes,” he breathed, and kissed her. It was fast – but her face was flushed, and her eyes wide as he pulled back. His own eyes were wide, gods be damned, and he was still rubbing his thumb against her soft cheek. Still contemplating going back for more, because that hadn’t been nearly enough.”Celaena & Rowan:”Why don’t you just bite me again?”“Why don’t I give you the lashing you deserve?”He looked so dead set on it that she blinked. “If you ever take a whip to me, I will skin you alive.”Oh, ho ho! Those two!! So much passion, so much pain! They were quite a sight to behold! *lol* I loved how their initial animosity turned into a solid friendship and I was so glad Celaena finally told someone about her past! This was so damn necessary and I’m glad Rowan was there to listen to her troubles and fears! <3 I’m sure they’ll become lovers in the future, but as it seems Sarah just wants to torture us a little bit more. ;-P After all she’s good at that, torture seems to be her middle name! XD Bet the J. is just a fib! Haha!”It was a selfish wish, and a fool’s hope.” She read the rest of it in his eyes. But it came true. “Dangerous, for a prince of ice and wind to pray to the Fire-Bringer,” she managed to say.Rowan shrugged, a secret smile on his face as he wiped away the tear that escaped down her cheek. “For some reason, Mala likes me, and agreed that you and I make a formidable pair.”Okay, I think I ranted enough now. *lol* So yeah, I hope I’ll get my hands on“Queen of Shadows”soon and that myprecious Gemwill continue this journey with me! I even wrote nice things about Chaol!! That’s got to count! ;-P'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Ohmygosh.

Sarah J Maas is becoming my favourite author. Her writing style is engaging, engrossing, intelligent, and easy to follow. Her imagination and storytelling are amazing. This story is a lot slower than the Crown of Midnight; it concentrates more on the character development.At the end of the last book, we learned not only who Celaena Sardothien really is but also what she really is. Her relationship with Chaol is in tatters. Having ""suggested"" to the king to send her on a mission for her own protection and cutting Prince Dorian out of the loop, Chaol is in no man’s land. Distancing himself from Dorian, for Dorian own protection, he starts to do his job and notices some irregularities with a certain high-ranking general. This forces Chaol to make some decisions of his own, how long can a good honourable man serve a tyrant like the King of Aldarlan and his many atrocities.Dorian is more alone than he has ever been, but he does manage to find solace. Finding a company is not really difficult for a handsome prince, but who can he trust. This is triply difficult as he has to not only keep his own actives, which his father will not approve of secret, his friends secrets, and most of all, his magic.We also introduced the Iron Teeth Witch Clans and especially Manon Blackbeak. Meanwhile, Celaena detours from her mission and pursues her own agenda. Meeting forgotten and powerful relatives. Before she is allowed to get the answers she wants, she must claim her heritage (her powers). She must learn to control them and master them all the while, putting he shattered life and her past. I really like the way she has to train and relearn everything. Just because you are in a stronger body does not mean you can control it, especially in a fight situation.Great story, very character driven, and impossible to put down. I kept thinking I would just read one more chapter, flicked a few pages, and thought ok I will stop at the next section break, or that\'s a short chapter might as well as finish it. Suddenly, half a quarter of the book was gone. Despite being 550+ pages, the book just flies by. It sets up the next book excellently, including a confrontation I have been begging for since the first e-novel.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Initial Reaction: Holy crap. I can\'t breathe. Oh my god. That was epic. WHERE IS BOOK #4??Read the full review atA Perfection Called Books**This review contains spoilers from previous Throne of Glass booksAs I\'m sure you all know by now, I am obsessed with the Throne of Glass series by Sarah J Maas. I was ecstatic when Bloomsbury sent me an ARC! Picking up not long after the heart-wrenching end of Crown of Midnight, Sarah J Maas dazzles and entrances readers once more with a phenomenal third book filled with magic, character growth, sacrifice, rebellion and more.“I wish you to become who you \xadwere born to be. To become queen.”Heir of Fire has most definitely made my list of best books of 2014. This book is quite different from the others in the series. I liked it a bit less than the other two, but it was so different it\'s hard to compare them. The other books center around romance and action while this book deals with the deeper stuff: betrayal, confidence, mourning, rebellion, heritage, loyalty...This book is huge. It was a bit cumbersome to hold, but the content was great! The beginning was a bit slow but eventually picked up. Everything written was absolutely necessary to carry the story though, so I didn\'t mind. The attention to detail was amazing. Everything was there for a reason, there were connections to the other books all over the place! It brought back all the feels from The Assassin\'s Blade & Crown of Midnight. Sarah J Maas is so meticulous about her writing and is truly in a league of her own. The tone of the book was much darker too. Maas has set this series on a much darker (and awesome) road than most YA series (even fantasy novels) tend to go, and I applaud her for it.The high fantasy aspect of this book was amped up. There was magic and wyverns and fae! I loved it all. This series reminds me of a YA version of Game of Thrones a bit... Less sex and deaths though. The world-building was fantastic. Everything was so clearly described. I could see it all playing out in my mind.The character development in this series is fantastic. Each of our characters has his/her own obstacles that must be overcome; they all have their own journeys.“Because I am lost,"" she whispered onto the earth. ""And I do not know the way.”We see a totally different side of Celaena in Heir of Fire. We\'re used to the cocky, confident, invincible assassin. In this book we see the vulnerable, defeated, self-loathing side of her. In the end though she comes out more fierce and determined than before, a magic-wielding queen ready to take back what\'s rightfully hers.“As for Celaena,"" he said again, ""you do not have the right to wish she were not what she is. The only thing you have a right to do is decide whether you are her enemy or her friend.”Chaol struggles to decide where his loyalties lie and how he feels about Celaena and the discoveries he made in Crown of Midnight. I\'ll admit, Chaol annoyed me so much in this book. He redeems himself in the end though. Dorian struggles to conceal his magic and stand up to his father. Both characters come so far in this book. They sacrifice so much and in the end they make the tough decisions where this is no turning back.There are quite a few new characters introduced in this book: Rowan, the fae prince and warrior who teaches Celaena how to control her magic. Aedion, the fierce general and Celaena\'s cousin. Manon, ferocious heir to the Blackbeak witch coven. All of the characters in this book are so complex and well developed. The secondary characters are just as descriptive as well. I ALMOST ship Rowan and Celaena, but I think they\'re more of a team. He\'s so fiercely devoted and smart and honest and awesome!! Aedion is so loyal and amazing. Manon is okay, she\'s a bit too blood-thirsty...With new characters come more points of view. Overall I liked the various perspectives because the plot needed all sides of the story to make sense. Sometimes though I felt that some scenes were quite unnecessary and long and dragging.We learn so many things about Erilea and what happened to Celaena ten years ago. It\'s all quite mind-blowing and a bit overwhelming. We also learn more about the King\'s nefarious actions. We see connections all over the place from the various books! Maas has been spreading the crumbs throughout the series until BAM you read Heir of Fire, and it all comes together!! The wyrdstones. The tower. The rings. The disappearances. The crumbled note. The rebels. Baba Yellowlegs. Everything happens for a reason and contributes to the story in some way.“The people you love are just weapons that will be used against you.”Romance was not a big part of this novel. There are some heartache moments for our dearest Chaolaena and a bit of romance, but there are much more important things brewing in Erilea and Wendlyn. This series is past the silly romance, it\'s moved on to the important stuff like defeating a diabolical king, bringing back magic, freeing the enslaved, and so on.As I said before, this book starts off a bit slow. Stick with it though, if you liked the other books you\'ll love this one as well. The ending is horrific yet amazing at the same time. The rebellion is forming, and we readers are kept wanting more.“He would see that world reborn, even if it took his last breath. Even if he had no name now, no position or title save Oath-Breaker, Traitor, Liar.”Heir of Fire is yet another amazing installment of the Throne of Glass series. WHERE IS BOOK #4????“She was the heir of ash and fire, and she would bow to no one.”Pre-Reading Hyped Review:Oh Captain... I\'m waiting ;)6/21I am getting a physical ARC copy of HEIR OF FIRE.

It was touch and go for two books, but this... this didn\'t even feel like belonging to the same series anymore. Maas has fixed almost everything I didn\'t care for in the first two books, starting with Celaena\'s character, which is literally gone, to be replaced by new and improved, and more believable Aelin Galathynius. The assassin who never assassinates, or even behaves as an assassin is no more.While we still get to enjoy the three key POVs, there are some great new characters being improved in this third book, each sharing their own perspectives. The way Maas tying two or three of them at a time (may be except for Manon) for each chapter made for a little unusual, but quite an interesting reading experience. It broke the monotony of the flow of story very well in my opinion. And Manon... A fascinating new character with her own immersive thread. I was a little confused at start, but quickly came to love that particular plotline: It was new, had a lot of mystery, and continuously eventful. And then Aedion and Rowan, who were equally interesting additions to the story, and there was never a dull moment with this trio.""It was madness and joy and terror and despair and eternity.""Now that I have finished three books, I did start to see certain similarities as well. In each book, Maas took her time in the first half, maintaining a slower pace, heavily focused on character relationships while sprinkling a little bit of magic and mystery here and there. But the second halves were always much faster, eventful, and a lot more thrilling. I was too annoyed with Celaena\'s character before to clearly notice this before, but I\'m hoping it would be consistent throughout the series.Though it didn\'t make much sense, I had still found the plot of this of series intriguing from the very first book. Heir of Fire finally explains many of those mysteries we had come across before, and appeared to be setting the direction of the series. More than once, I felt this could\'ve been a better starting point to this series. Compared to where we started, the plot was also a lot more complex with in-depth world building. With 4 more books remaining, I know it\'s too early to form an overall opinion, but, it feels like things could only get better after this. This is one of the best comebacks I\'ve came across lately.""Loyalty is earned, not given.""'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""BEAUTIFUL.

You do not have the right to wish she were not what she is.”But she learns to embrace her powers and control them. Sometimes it takes a monster to fight a monster.“Perhaps they would never get out of it, perhaps they would never be whole again, but … “Together,” she said, and took his outstretched hand.And somewhere far and deep inside her, an ember began to glow.”It's honestly been SUCH an amazing journey on how far our character has come.

Sometimes this can be a dull part of a book OR worse!! When people are suddenly masters of epic powers*grrrrr*Instead, she epically messed up... quite a lot... Aelin had to learn to control her abilities and fucked up quite a bit, to be honest“But each morning brought something new, something harder and different and miserable. Gods, he was brilliant. Cunning and wicked and brilliant.Even when he beat the hell out of her. Every. Damn. Day.”CAN'T YOU JUST PICTURE IT !She began the story asCelaena: assassin of Adarlanbetrayed by loved Chaol, manipulated by Nehemia, and scared of her own power and destiny. She ended asAelin Ashryver Galathynius“She was as much a queen as Maeve. She was the sovereign of a strong people and a mighty kingdom. She was the heir of ash and fire, and she would bow to no one.”And it all comes together with reiterating my FAVORITE quote from the first book“I will call in every favor, every debt owed to Celaena Sardothien, to my parents, to my bloodline. And then…” She looked toward the sea, toward home.“And then I am going to rattle the stars.”""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Uuuuh, girl.Empezamos a ver elevidente cambio en el universo deTrono de Cristal, una saga que comienza de forma un poco 'inocente' para lo que nos espera en sus continuaciones.Se nota hacia dónde vamos, y todo lo que ha llevado a este punto simplemente encaja, cuadra y te hace querer descubrir todo lo que Sarah tiene entre manos para con esta saga.Mucha gente odia a Celaena(¡cosa que no entiendo!),y aunque en ocasiones toma ciertas decisiones más que cuestionables, siempre sale airosa de las situaciones, porque tiene una mente estratégica y conoce perfectamente las posibles variables de sus planes. Pero sobre todo, lo que más me gusta de ella, es su psique.Es fuerte, conoce sus límites y miedos, y es capaz de controlar tantísimas emociones y guardarlas para fortalecerle que simplemente chapó.La construcción del personaje no deja de mejorar, viendo a una protagonista mucho más madura y adulta que en la primera parte de esta saga.Heredera de fuegoes diferente a los otros dos libros en muchos aspectos. No solo es mayor en cuanto a longitud de páginas, sino quepor primera vez tenemos la introducción de nuevos personajes que tienen pinta de que han venido para quedarse.Además, no todos ellos tienen una presencia dentro del ecosistema que conocíamos en Adarlan con Celaena, Chaol o Dorian, sino que los mundos fantásticos deMaas exploran otras fronteras y nuevas posibilidades, algo que agradezco, porque se denota todo el cariño y esfuerzo deworldbuildingque tiene esta saga.Para hablar de nuevos personajes... Podría tirarme horas, la verdad.Me ha encantado Rowan.DE VERDAD. Me parece una especie de Celaena, un poquito más oscuro, déspota y con menos sentimientos, pero igual de fuerte y disciplinado con un pasado traumático. El tándem que se genera entre Rowan y ella es de lo mejor del libro y no podía despegarme de las páginas en sus escenas. Luego tenemos aManon,y descubriremos por fin más sobre la magia ancestral de las brujas en este universo que nos fue introducido vagamente enCorona de medianoche. Me ha encantado ver lo diferente que ese micro-cosmos sanguinario y milenario, con la introducción de nuevas criaturas fantásticas y conflictos que estoy seguro darán mucho que hablar en las continuaciones.También tenemos a Aedion, que simplemente...cheff kiss.Quizá no tanto por él en sí, sino todo lo que le rodea, lo que genera en cuanto a temática y lo que supone para el futuro de la historia.He de admitir que me ha costado un poco terminar este libro.Lo abandoné un poquito más hacia el final, superado el ecuador, y como siempre me pasa... me arrepentí. Por mucho que me fascinara Manon como personaje, sus escenas a veces eran algo repetitivas.Lo que sucede en palacio con Dorian y Chaol era entretenido pero sentía que a veces renqueaba, avanzando demasiado lento.Pero bueno, que estoy hablando de un libro de Sarah J Maas. ¡Que en verdad no tiene relleno! Porque una vez avanzas esos obstáculos donde se definen personajes o se le dabackgrounda ciertas tramas o problemas, todo cobra sentido para desembocar en un final apoteósico.[image error]La evolución de la magia en este libro ha sido sin duda de lo mejor.Poder ver a Aelin disfrutar de todo su potencial, conocer la verdadera naturaleza de sus poderes,el inicio de lo que parece ser un ejército de zombies, los guivernos, conocer por fin el poder del rey de Adarlan... No sé, brillante que comencemos hablando de asesinatos para terminar en una guerra de poder mágico entre territorios.Heredera de fuegopuede no haberme volado la mente como los anteriores, pero consigue cementar a la saga como una de calidad superior y de personajes simplemente increíbles, y por eso se lleva mis dieces.Muero de ganas por tener en mis manos el siguiente, que saldrá a la venta en español en los próximos meses. ¡Ya os contaré!""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I had forgotten how agonizing this book is.It\'s a beautiful tale of grief, trauma, and in the end—triumph.Celaena Sardothien.Arrogant, charming, fiercely loyal. She\'s been broken. Over and over and over again. And yet she still stands strong, even in the face of suffering, agony, and emotional torture. She came to Wendlyn an empty person, devoid of all joy and peace. She left Wendlyn changed. She faced her past. She learned to accept every shattered part of her.Rowan Whitethorn.Resilient, stubborn, sardonic. He\'s all sharp edges and prickly thorns, but once Celaena gets past his rough exterior, she realizes he is hurting. Just like she is. They are kindred spirits in a lonely world.Chaol Westfall.Bitter, persistent, brave. He was left in pieces when Celaena left for Wendlyn. His friendship with Dorian is in tatters, his mental health is at a low. But he carries on. He\'s the only ordinary human in a world filled with magic, and he feels his weaknesses with every step.However, he is not right for Celaena, and we all know it. He sold her out and he refused to accept every part of her. He was an essential part of her journey, but she is a different person now.""She was not becoming anything different from what she always was and always had the capacity to be. You just finally saw everything. And once you saw that other part of her..."" Dorian said quietly. ""You cannot pick and choose which parts of her to love.""Dorian Havilliard.Devoted, intelligent, determined. He\'s insightful and sensitive, always tuned to the feelings and needs of others. He\'s accepting and kind, forgiving and generous. He accepts Celaena and still treats her like a friend, understanding that she must move on.Sorscha.Kind, gentle, courageous. I hated her the first time I read this book. But this time around, I was actually quite fond of her. She\'s a quiet, brave person. Her mild infatuation with Dorian still annoys me, but I can see now that she was absolutely essential to his recovery process. She helped Dorian when he was lonely and hurting. She made a discovery about magic that was very underwhelming, but at least she actually tried to help him.Manon Blackbeak.Cruel, cold, adamant. Violent and steadfast and so gloriouslybrutal.She\'s devoted to the Thirteen before everyone else. She\'s terrifying and beautifully deadly, but she cares deeply once you get past her mask. She\'s been manipulated and molded into the killing machine that she is now, but there is a great possibility for kindness within her, and that part of her shows whenever she\'s around Abraxos.Aedion Ashryver.Clever, loyal, haunted. He\'s hot-headed and bloodthirsty, but his mind never leaves Aelin. He\'s been living a lie ever since the massacre at Terrasen, and he\'s determined to destroy Adarlan from the inside out.These characters are beautiful.They\'re flawed, but so wonderfully vibrant.They jump off the page, almost. They have personal struggles and fears, but they\'re brave and loyal and dedicated to their cause.

The rich development of the plot and the characters, the scope of the world, the side characters, the multiple POV's... Maas truly outdid herself with this book.Celaena was just phenomenal in this instalment. Her growth was astounding and I loved how this started off with her almost breaking down with grief and depression and intense self-hatred and shame. Sarah J Maas has a knack for really diving into broken characters, and as the story progressed and we found out more about Celaena’s past, I felt the weight of her sadness and responsibility with her. It was heartbreaking to read.One of the main things I’ve noticed whilst rereading the series this time round is how parallel and connected each plot and each character is to one another. There’s something about that that I just love, because it not just about Celaena trying to reclaim who she is, but about how each characters struggle and success adds to the bigger picture of it all, of this world they are wanting to rebuild and the peace they’re trying to regain.Every character and their journey is adding something to the story, the overall, bigger picture.

Not only forCelaena Sardothienbut also for all of her companions and enemies.Heavy with grief,Celaenais sent on a mission byAdarlan\'s King, with the purpose of assassinating the King and Crown Prince of Wendlyn.UnlikeErilea, magic roams freely inWendlyn, a Kingdom ruled byHouse Ashryver.

I\'m truly yet again in awe of howSarah J Maasseamlessly managed to expand the world ofThrone of Glassbeyond what we had in the first two books. Theworld-building and the settingwas lushly atmospheric and rich in details.Theaction-sequencesfired me up and had me on the edge of my seat.Heir of Fireintroduced us to three new characters that have joined the main cast:• Rowan Whitethorn: A Fae Prince and one of the six elite warriors serving under Queen Maeve.• Aedion Ashryver: A General in Adarlan\'s army and cousin toAelin Ashryver Galathynius, the lost heir ofTerrasen.• Manon Blackbeak: An Ironteeth Witch and Heir of the Blackbeak Witch ClanThe book is divided intomultiple POVSof: Celaena, Chaol, Dorian, Manon and Rowan.Each character gets theproper developmentneeded to push the story further which shaped the events of what is yet to come in the future.InCelaena\'schapters, I loved seeing the development between her and Rowan; feeling the intense tension between them, then seeing that dislike mellowing and turning into admiration and then witnessing that growing friendship between them turn into something much more precious, a bond sealed by the words""To Whatever End"".ThroughManon Blackbeak\'schapters, we are introduced to theWitch-clansofThe Waste. There are three main Ironteeth Witch clans:The Blackbeaks, The Yellowlegs and The Bluebloods. The Ironteeth Witches are offered to chooseWyvernsto fly into battle and become part ofKing Adarlan\'snew Aerial Legion. Manon chooses a bait wyvern and names himAbraxos, after the ancient serpent who held the world between his coils at the behest of the Three-Faced Goddess..Chaol and Dorian\'schapters give insight to the events occurring inAdarlanand the secrets that are uncovered especially the ones concerning Aelin. Dorian begins to learn more of his magic while Chaol must do what needs to be done in order to protect Dorian and his Kingdom. Also, a new romance sparks for Dorian with his healerSorchawho helped attend to his, Chaol and Celaena\'s wounds for months.I also loved thesecondary charactersthat were present in the book:Emrys, Luca, Malakai, Asterin and the brief appearance of Rowan\'s Cadre.To me,Heir of Firewas a healing book and an adventure that took me to different places at the same time. I felt the consuming rush of adrenaline through most of it, I felt the hollowness of the scenes that dealt with grief, and heart fluttered and tingled during the heartwarming scenes.I think all this points out to why I love this book the most out of all the other 7 books in the series.

I didn't want to punch her THAT much- Dorian is getting a personality!!!- Aedion, man of my dreams- MANON YOU ARE THE BITCH WITCH OF MY HEART- the plot was PLOT, like it actually moved and had depth and shit???- and of course... ROWANRowan, you sweet tortured baby, you deserve your own paragraph. IlovedRowan and I especially loved how he treated Celaena. Frankly, she kind of deserved to be treated like shit for a little bit. I liked that he was standoffish and that he has some backstory of his own. Inevitably, I compared him to Rhysand in my mind and that initially made Rowan fall kind of flat... but once I pushed that away I REALLY appreciated this sweet boi for what he is. Which is: perfect for Celaena.And I think that's really where Maas succeeds. She creates beautifully flawed (and yes sometimes annoying) characters that interact SO WELL with each other. I live for the ships in her books because flaws are complemented, strong suits are contrasted, and in general I wait with bated breath for the characters to get it on. So clearly she's doing something right.This was great & I'm VERY excited for the rest of the series.Also I didn't forget Chaol, I just hate him.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3 - 3.5 StarsMaybe I will review this later, maybe I won’t...Regardless.

Not in Love
",Ali Hazelwood,3.65,166897,5229,"Contemporary, Contemporary Romance, Fiction, Audiobook, Adult, Chick Lit, New Adult",384,11-06-2024,"A forbidden, secret affair proves that all’s fair in love and science.Rue Siebert might not have it all, but she has enough: a few friends she can always count on, the financial stability she yearned for as a kid, and a successful career as a biotech engineer at Kline, one of the most promising start-ups in the field of food science. Her world is stable, pleasant, and hard-fought. Until a hostile takeover and its offensively attractive front man threatens to bring it all crumbling down.Eli Killgore and his business partners want Kline, period. Eli has his own reasons for pushing this deal through - and he's a man who gets what he wants. With one burning exception: Rue. The woman he can't stop thinking about. The woman who's off-limits to him.Torn between loyalty and an undeniable attraction, Rue and Eli throw caution out the lab and the boardroom windows. Their affair is secret, no-strings-attached, and has a built-in deadline: the day one of their companies will prevail. But the heart is risky business - one that plays for keeps.","[{'rating': 3, 'content': '2.75/5The review contains spoilers!It pains me to have to give this story such a low rating because Ali Hazelwood\'s books have always been one of my favorite forms of escapism, but Not in Love was the first book by this author that didn\'t make me blush, giggle, kick my feet, scream into my pillow, and highlight every possible cute scene. I don\'t know if it\'s because of some kind of curse that seems to be weighing on me this year and making most of this year\'s book releases a huge disappointment, or maybe the fact that Ali\'s more erotic romances may not be for me, but while reading Rue and Eli\'s story, I felt practically nothing. I literally went to scroll through instagram in the middle of their love confession. I think that speaks for itself.Ali Hazelwood is known for writing obsessed, even pathetically obsessed men—just how I like them, so when I heard she was finally going to write a story that was also from the hero’s point of view, I knew I had to read it the second it’s released. Unfortunately, even though Eli Kilgore was the epitome of ""man in finance, six-five, blue eyes""—I don’t know if he was exactly six foot five, but he was obviously tall and big everywhere, as usual—and he was a gentleman, who could cook, wore glasses, loved dogs, didn’t like driving microwaves (Teslas), and would probably do anything for Rue, there was one thing about him that didn’t sit right with me. I\'m not even talking about him mentioning his schlong in almost every chapter and saying that Rue was a ""fantastic lay,"" but I\'m talking about him and his ex-fiancée. Look, I know he was a thirty-four-year-old man and it would be weird if he had never been in a relationship and had gone through life with only one-night stands, but the fact that he was ""A little"" jealous of his ex new partner, and“Was your fiancée into it?”“She was. We were very well matched in that sense.”[…]“I’d tie her up. Blindfold her. Hold her down. Tell her what to do. Do you know what orgasm denial is?”“My ex-fiancée was a chef,” he said.Her look was blank. “And?”“She was—is—damn good. And she thought everyone should have at least three signature dishes they could prepare without needing a recipe.”""Cooking with McKenzie had been a lot of fun—McKenzie, who was bright and sunny and made everything turn into banter and kisses flavored with whatever ingredients they’d been using. Rue was nothing like that. She was intense and focused. A real fortress. She spoke little, always relevant questions and the occasional deadpan joke that had Eli biting his cheek to avoid laughing.""\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200eRue also had some one night stands and briefly mentioned them, but those men meant nothing to her, but every time Eli talked or thought about his ex-fiancée like that, all I could think was, ""Please stop. Please. Stop."" I know he was over her and only had eyes for Rue, but quotes like that left a bitter taste in my mouth. Also, why did they have dinner with his ex? It was mentioned in the epilogue. Why did his ex make him and Rue dinner? It’s weird.Moving on to our heroine—Rue Siebert, I liked her. Will she be added to my favorite characters shelf? No, but I could relate to her in some way, so it was hard for me not to like her character. In fact, it\'s hard for me not to like this author\'s heroines, because I could never dislike passionate women in STEM. I mean, if they were terrible people then yes, but Ali Hazelwood\'s women are not.As the beginning of the book states that Not in Love is ""less of a rom-com and more of an erotic romance"", I knew that it would have more mature scenes than most of Ali\'s books, and probably less of those typical rom-com-y ones, but I didn\'t know it would turn out to be something I wouldn\'t be a big fan of. I\'ve read a lot of erotic novels and I\'ve really enjoyed some of them, but I don\'t think books like this by Ali Hazelwood will be for me. It\'s not that there weren\'t some touching and romantic scenes, but Rue and Eli\'s intimate life seemed to overshadow them, and because of that, I couldn\'t feel a deeper connection between our main characters. I think I could have survived even without the feeling that the two of them were soulmates if I had felt any chemistry between them — which is usually welcomed in erotic literature, but even that was missing for me.Ali\'s stories bring so much happiness to my life and I can\'t help but smile when I think about some of them, so even though Not in Love has unfortunately ended up at the end of my list of her books, it doesn\'t mean I\'ll stop reading them. Yes, they are cringey, and yes, some of the quotes make me wonder who allowed them to be published, but I don\'t think I\'ll ever be able to hate them.────────ahhhhh it’s here it’s here it’s here'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'NOT IN LOVE with it.How can I be in love with it when even the characters are NOT IN LOVE?!This is probablyone of the worst books I have read this year, or ever in general.So brace yourself for therant review,cause someone needs to tell Ali Hazelwood how bad her book is and why I will not be reading any of her future books(we\'ll see about that, don\'t hold me to it).1. Firstly let\'s start with the fact thatwe\'re just thrown into the story.We are not made aware of what\'s happening, or happened. It\'s like the book started off at 25% mark and we\'re all magically supposed to know everything. Things did not make sense for a long time.2.The whole Kline vs Harkness plot? BOO!!!So poorly written. I could be least interested. There was hardly any attempt to make readers care about that plotline. Why should I care about it if you did not spend time writing about it? See this is why you start with a book in a manner that the readers actually understand the issue.3. The two main characters- Eli and Rue. KILL ME NOW.Ruehas a personality of a cardboard. No wait, even a cardboard shows more personality. She is extremely boring and has no social or people skills at all. The only time she actually seemed normal was when she was drunk 🤡Eliis comparatively bit better. But he gets really creepy sometimes, idk how to explain it. Also, apparently he has a ""magic cock"" 🤢 I needed Ali to stop writing it like that but ofc I wish for things that can\'t come true. He also said he would be tempted to cheat on his ex with the fmc 🚩4. Thenon existent romance-It isEXTREMELY insta lusty.EXTREMELY. I hated the way it started off in chapter one itself.The first half spice is usual Ali sort- BAD.But I will admit, I liked two spice scenes in the second half which is kinda shocking but I\'ll give this book 1 star for that. Then towards the end, Rue uses ""love"" tomanipulate(in her own words) to get Eli to make her orgasm, which was so weird. If a man had done that, no one would like it. Idk when and where did these two form a bond from cause there isABSOLUTELY NO CHEMISTRYbetween the two. There is NO LOVE between the two, at least not that I saw and it\'s all a weird sexual infatuation.Please don\'t read this book or waste your money, time on it. It might sound harsh but thetruth is Ali Hazelwood\'s writing is below average in this book.She needs to stop publishing multiple mediocre books a year as it\'s deeply affecting her quality. It should always be quality over quantity and not the other way around. If she focuses on one book at a time, there might be some hope for her writing career otherwise the hype is already burning out. Also, can someone from her team tell her to stop writing cringe scenes and smut? You want fans to buy her books but won\'t listen to fans when they give you constructive criticism. How is that fair?!Also, thanks to lovely Noi for reading this with me and letting me rant.

One more fault to add to the humbling business of falling in love, he supposed.”If you want enjoy this book,manage your expectationsbecause it is not a bad book it's just very different from what Ali Hazelwood usually writes so it is definitely not for her normal target audience. I myself feel like I would have enjoyed this book if I had known what I was going in for. I did try to expect something different when I read the note that its more of an'Erotic romance' rather than a 'Rom-com'and it made me enjoy the book more and tbh I may change the rating in the future, this is just based on what I felt right now.This is Hazelwood'smost distinctwork as of yet. It doesn’t have her super quirky female leads who are as usual oblivious and tiny and it also lacks grumpy, broody male leads. The writing style for this book was so different because the last book that I read by her was 'Bride' and it was so different, this just didn't feel like a book written by Ali Hazelwood at all. She finally took the genre 'New Adult' to her heart because it was so realistic, her characters were very realistic and the whole vibe of the book was more intense rather than fluffy. So, yeahdo NOT expect a rom-com.Ruewas our FMC and a very different mc from what the author usually aims for and I didn’t mind her at all she was fun to read about but that was pretty much it. As forEli, our MMC he was so in love with the Rue, like he was the definition of downbad. The way he would speak about her in his inner monologues or how would be willing to do anything for her but then again that was pretty much it. It for me felt like Eli's whole personality was lusting over Rue and thinking about having sex with her. There was such minimal connection that I felt towards the characters and that almost never happens with her books, even if it does happen I can still enjoy it because of their nature but despite Eli and Rue being more different, mature and realistic than her other character, they still failed to deliver on making me understand or sympathize with them.Now, I did not mind the erotic theme, I did not know that this book was actually a part of that genre because I really thought that this was just an Ali Hazelwood with the most steam, it was worrying because her smut scenes aren't always well written but here, I must admit some of the scenes were well written and handled well, don’t get me wrong there were cringe scenes but it wasn't her worst, it had some good scenes 😭😭. The romance besides the smut…..I did not care for, truth be told I did not even care for the smutty scenes because there was this lack of connection between the characters and the romance did not feel good. It was also the fact that the romance was overall very insta-lusty and I wasn't a fan of it. The romance also felt very mid because it started of with them being enemies with benefits and the transition into love felt so sudden, I didn’t feel like we got enough time to even process what was going on.As for the plot, I couldn’t really care for it either.Its not that I did not enjoy this book, because there were moments that I really enjoyed but most of the time while reading this book, I was so conflicted as to what to think of it and I think if I had a sense of what this book was aiming before I had set all my expectations or if I had known how different it is from her other works before I got this book, I might have had a better experience. I was so sure that it was a stem rom-com with enemies with benefits but failed to see the change that was going to come with it. I can see myself giving this book a 3 but nothing more than that because I enjoyed it that much only but it was a very interesting take and I would like to read more of Ali Hazelwood's books with the same style.__OMGG A WEEK TILL WE GET ALI'S FIRST DOUBLE POV BOOK WHERE THE FMC'S TITS DEFY GRAVITY APPARENTLY?!?""}, {'rating': None, 'content': 'update:UMM HELLO?? THE COVER??forbidden, angsty, boy obsessed and enemies with benefits?? ENOUGH SAID, JUST TAKE MY MONEY RN!!'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Yea I know I said that I'm done with Ali Hazelwood books, but guess what?I fuckin lied.I’m glad I did, too, not because I condone lying or anything—trust me—but because despite my negativity towards the book in the first half by the end it more or less won me over. Like a romance should do—wait was I involved in an enemies to lovers trope with this book!?!?Anyways, like the title, I’m not in love with this one and it feels very rushed and unpolished but I also didn’t hate it and I appreciate that Ali Hazelwood has been continuing to try new things, with a YA and a paranormal romance in the past year and while this is sort of a return to her STEM-style it is less romcom, more grit, way more spice and a lot more nuance and complex characters. So, alright, no more lies, lets talk about the book which is straightforward with its title because Rue and Eli are very muchNot in Love.Okay, fine, maybe love is up for discussion in the boardroom here butNot in Lovelaunches us into the story of one-night-stands-only Rue wakes up from a lovely time with Eli to discover themselves on opposite sides of company finance issues. And so we begin an enemies-with-benefits to lovers narrative with Eli working to take possession of the food nanotech company Rue has fought through misogynistic university and STEM programs to work for. And I know what you are all wondering—is it once again a tiny gal with a huge hulking beast of man meat and tameable fury? Well, this time no!Okay fine, she is actually a tall woman this time but yea, he’s fucking huge. And a hockey player with some hockey stuff that feels very tacked on. But also a finance bro trying to take over a company which is pretty thumbs down on his record and at first when I realized it was going to be all “but he’s actually a good person” I thought “sounds unlikely, Ali” but hell she pulled it off and by the end they work. It helps he’s absolutely into Rue even if he doesn’t want to admit it and Hazelwood throws some twists into the narrative that make the initial plot much more palatable.Then again, so much of this is still just capitalism-as-kink but I appreciate Hazelwood really pushing her own boundaries here. There’s a lot of Eli pushing into Rue too which like…I’m fairly under versed in the genre but I don’t feel like Hazelwood is necessarily stellar at spicy scenes? I mean, maybe its just me but lines like ‘are you anticipating curing me with your magic cock?’ are a bit clumsy at best, though I suppose sex between people trying to hate each other is always going to be clumsy. Also apparently Rue has space boobs that defy gravity.No, Hazelwood said so, look: ‘Her breasts bounced—a masterpiece of gravity.’ TOLD YA. But…like, why? Why, Ali? In all fairness you don’t necessarily read romance for the plot per say, so that’s more on me, I just thought this struggled a bit to push itself along and here the amount of space given to them feels unjustified by a relatively thin plot that is straining to uphold them. But that bed was also straining so good for them even if they are caught up in a “I want your job to collapse” financial battle, though for all my hand wringing over that being annoying at least its real life and ends on a good note where I actually found the plotline about that to be handled alright.‘If i were able to love someone, i would choose you. In that timeline, I would want it to be you.’I was intending to make this a short review but I’d like to quickly touch upon some thoughts I had regarding the characters. ILOVEmessy characters, morally grey characters, characters that do well by reminding us people contain multitudes and the notion of people just being good or bad doesn’t hold up beyond Disney animations. Which I also love but that’s not my point. Hazelwood crafts some complex characters here where we see how their past traumas integrate with their present day personalities and interpersonal communications. Now, in terms of 2024 romances, I think this was all done more effectively byEmily HenryinFunny Story(which I discuss at lengthHERE) but I liked the ways we get into how growing up in poverty and food insecurity has haunted Rue and a childhood marked by the failure of a trusted adult lingers in big, beefy, “I’m into being dominant to the point of it being weird, have I mentioned my Ex-Fiance enough yet?” Eli. The characterizations do, however, make them rather cold and stand-offish (Eli is super into that about Rue) which undercuts a lot of the emotion in this book and makes them feel like knocking blocks of wood against each other. Its a satisfying clang of their bang but also, its a bit lifeless? Authors likeSally Rooney, for instance, have had great success in navigating this but Hazelwood just…never really brings it to life here and while they are complex it still feels like 2D characters with backstories tacked on and also the friendships with other characters felt more like NPCs added into the plot rather than productively-explored relationships. But Florence is cool at least.Shhhh! Anyways, I did enjoy the rotation between Rue and Eli’s perspectives, something that seems to be more common and was also a characteristic ofLynn Painter's recentHappily Never After, and gave a first person perspective of what Rue was thinking in her mind and a third-person perspective of Eli that allowed the narrative to sort of info-dump the board room aspects of the plot. Though with Rue there’s this aspect she has a Big Secret that, when it comes out, doesn’t actually seem likethatbig of a deal but also…if we are trying to stream-of-conscious her mind it feels awkward that she never ever actually thinks about it? In many ways it feels a bit contrived and like, I get that this is a book in service for the plot, but it just felt a bit underwhelming. Also the whole aspect of Eli being all like “oh I just really like inflicting pain on women to show im in charge” being played off as just some orgasmic fun felt weird in a novel that also addresses the rampant abuse and oppression of women in STEM fields. Maybe those things are systemic Enjoy what you like though, I don’t care and it was implied it was always consensual but it just felt like some eye rolling straight man in finance needing to feel like CEO of the bedroom and like... lol. Whatever.‘If you still want me to love you, I really think I can love you back. Because I already do.” Two tears streaked her cheekbones…and if you don’t, I guess I’ll be loving you anyway.’At the end of the day, this wasn’t my favorite but I enjoyed it well enough and don’t regret reading it. It feels like a bit of a bridge between her lighter, romcom STEM books and a future in more gritty and complex relationship novels so theres a few stumbling blocks along the way but it is cool to see an author I have a soft spot for progressing. Gotta admit the whole “we don’t believe in love” then actually do felt a little tired, and asJulia Armfieldwrites inPrivate Ritesthere’s ‘nothing more tedious than a person who wears their aversion to commitment as a blazon of their own originality.’ Cute enough, a bit frustrating as it seems trying to force itself a bit and reads as if the writing was rather rushed, but altogether…it was a book? Though, maybe its time, I think this will be my last Hazelwood.2.5/5""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Es el libro que menos me ha gustado de Ali 😭.

Could she risk her heart to the enemy who is about to steal everything she’s worked for or could she be wrong about his motives from the beginning?Well, I just guessed the real villain of the story from the beginning.

I enjoyed their blooming intense relationship and Eli was one of the best book boyfriends Ali Hazelwood she’s created with his caring, passionate attitudes and high charisma, loyalty, honesty. Eli is also easy to resonate with her eccentricity.I never get bored this devouring\xa0 Stem romance series and I couldn’t get enough of them which means this is one of my top most anticipated 20 romances of the year and I’m also attaching the link to my article on medium.com that mentioning this amazing book:https://medium.com/@niluferyozmekik/v...and highly recommend you to read this book.

This book would've still been readable if it actually had a plot. Oh you ask what it's about? I'll tell youHe is her enemy.She ignores him.He's obsessed with herThey fuck.She ignores him.He's obsessed with herThey fuckMultiply it by 100There, I saved you from 400 pages of misery. Thank me later.--CHARACTERS--Rue:Rue ruined it for me. She was definitely different from other Ali Hazelwood's fmc. For one, she was TALL. Yeah I was shocked too but in a good way. She has been portrayed as a reserved socially awkward individual which was perfectly fine but girl, you still have to COMMUNICATE. She annoyed me so much everytime sheabruptly left or simply refused to talkor admit what she's actually feeling.Eli:He's perfect for girls looking for a man in finance, trust fund, six five, blue eyes (Yeah I know how cringe that, move on. Not my fault it matched the description so perfectly).I genuinely liked him at first.The way he was pining after Rue, trying to love her despite her shortcomings and just not giving up. Yes please 🥺But... ofcourse, couldn't let a good thing last, now can we?He failed me when he couldn't even think about Rue without fantasizing the way he would make her cum or the things he wants to do with her. Hell in a chapter he actually confessed,he wasn't in love with Rue but her body.---ROMANCE---There wasno emotional connectionbetween the characters. I couldn't even connect with them, let alone root for them. It was all physical which was also ahem.The smut wasn't AS BAD as I thought maybe because my expectations were on the floor :)But then the author uses lines like these that remind me why I hated it in the first place. Bear with me~Ready to beg to smell the crease where her abdomen met her thigh.“Are you anticipating curing me with your magic cock?”“She shrugged. Her breasts bounced—a masterpiece of gravity.One more minor issue I had: the namesThis shouldn't affect me much since I've literally read a book by this author where the fmc is named 'Misery' but still. Names like Nyota? Ali, please tell which book of names you use and I'll happily burn it for you<3---PLOT---Like I said, there was no major plot in this book. The backstories felt meh to me. I wish the friendships were more explored, especially Florence and Rue's.I'm not sure if the concept of 'info dump' even exists in romance novels but it felt like that in this one. All the financial terms and issues were going straight up my head. I understood the basics but I'm a literature biology girl and I'm pretty sure I would've enjoyed this a bit better had everything been explained and put forward in a better way.In a nutshell, I personally wouldn't recommend.****cracks knuckles* oh boy, I've got a lot to say.

Ali if you are ok BLINK TWICE.I mean I know the industry is forcing every single author out there to start putting smut in their books because sex is the only thing that sells now thanks to booktok but for the LOVE OF GOD.Ali was the person who received a TON OF HATE for Love Hypothesis because ""it wasn\'t spicy enough"", ""it was lame because it only had one sex scene"", ""it was a little silly and romcommy"", BITCH THAT\'S THE ENTIRE REASON WHY I LIKED HER STYLE IN THE FIRST PLACE.She(used to)refused to sell herself out to the industry and wrote adorably quirky nerdy ALMOST innocent romances that actually made you cheer for the socially awkward female main characters and the brooding distant and intelligent male main characters.She used to be the EPITOME of what it meant to write a NEW ADULT novel, with a plot and endearing characters who fell in love and consequently end up having one sex scene on page and living happily ever after.BUT WE GET THIS WHORE HOUSE INSTEADOh, she warned people this was going to be different. Oh she told everyone this was going to have more smut.HOW ABOUT THIS DOESN\'T HAVE ANYTHING BUT!!!!!!!!!and it\'s not even well written smut. The characters talk breathe sing think about sex twenty four hours a day and there is absolutely nothing else going on in this god forsaken book.She doesn\'t even try to develop the characters, their dynamics, their personalities, there is absolutely NOTHING here. No chemistry, no love, no affection, nothing. It\'s just two incredibly horny people who will make you SERIOUSLY uncomfortable.At least that\'s what happened to me.If your character has NOTHING to contribute other than how horny they are 24/7 then I HAVE NO REASON TO RELATE TO THEM. I am sorry. This isn\'t romance. This is an erotica novel.She tried to create this very socially awkard female character who\'s afraid of getting hurt and because of that she only has one night stands but NO penetrative sex. She refuses to let dudes put their dicks inside her, but she will not stop talking about how horny she is. She treats every sexual encounter like A SERIAL KILLER. In the most distant, robotic way possible.""You don\'t enjoy penetrative sex.""You mean penetrative intercourse?""She sounded like a gynecologist and he couldn\'t wait to touch her.AND THE DUDE LIKED IT, because he\'s into gynecologists I guess? or into women who treat sex like a business transaction.He is equally as creepy because he:""was holding himself from driving to her house, watching her through her windows and masturbating furiously""and he ALSO stops her in the middle of her giving him a blowjob to tell her: My ex fiance cheated on me with my best friend and left, and married him, I think they have kids. Just thought you should know, you can carry on with the blowjob now(this is exactly how the scene went down)To him,""the way her tits bounced would count as a formative moment in his sexual history.""The words she used to describe these encounters and to try SO FUCKING hard to make this book edgy and erotic completely ruined the entire thing for me. The characters had no chemistry, no passion, not even a friendship. They had nothing in common and both of them felt borderline sociopathic to me.Every single scene made my skin crawl and being inside their heads (where FROM PAGE 1, with no slow burn or relationship buildup at all) all they talked about was: wow if she touches me I\'ll cum right here, wow her skin is radiating heat, wow she is talking about her job but I can\'t wait to put my dick in her mouth.sex sex sex sex sex, it\'s like this book was written by a 12 year old WITH an arousal disorder, I am not going to lie to you. The disappointment I feel is immense.BEFORE YOU COME FOR ME: NO, I am not a prude. I enjoy romance novels, It\'s ok to have erotic scenes in books, yatta yatta yatta. No one is judging you here. I am judging this HORRENDOUS writing. This complete lack of complexity in her characters, the most flushed out plot I have ever seen just so she could talk about sex constantly and the most uncomfortable book I have read in A WHILE.The day after they ""sleep together"" he tells her,well I never dreamt about cheating on a partner, but part of me almost wishes my marriage had worked so I could meet you and cheat on her with you, because that\'s how much I want you and that\'s how undeniable our attraction is.IS THIS WHAT YALL CALL ROMANCE??????????She tried so hard to make it seem like their chemistry was undeniable!!! Irresistible.(what chemistry?)She wanted this female main character to seem like a badass who could kill you with a pencil!!!(she\'s not, she\'s a shell of a human being with no personality, not her fault, the writer just forgot she needed one)She wanted so fucking bad to have an edgy romance where he is the bad guy because he is trying to buy the company she works for (he can legally do that without an issue) She tells him:I don\'t like you as a person.He replies withI\'m glad you don\'t need to like me to fuck me.OK CHRISTIAN GREY lolOne of her friends mentions that the fact that he is trying to buy the company she works for makes him someone who""takes what\'s others without consent""LMAO HE\'S JUST BUYING A COMPANY WITH MONEY HE HAS, A SIMPLE AND FAIRLY LEGAL PURCHASE, CHILL THE FUCK OUT VIGILANTE. lmaoAnyhow, this was a clusterfuck of so so so much telling and not showing. A clusterfuck of her trying to build the most erotic couple who treats sex like business, who are smart and don\'t get attached, who dirty talk all the time, who are nerds who get laid often because they are sooooooo hooooooot and soooooo like Christian Grey(even though he can\'t even have her touch his wrists without creaming his pants)Everything about this book was so unbelievable. Unreliable. Badly written and exaggerated to the point where I\'m officially done with Ali Hazelwood from this moment on.If this is what the industry wants to force her to do...SORRYIf her publisher (and I am assuming it was their decision and their push to pressure her into writing this heavy of an erotica book) wants to destroy an author\'s entire identity and the ONE thing that made her stand out: her unique, quirky, and fun writing(the fact that she was more New Adult with very little spice and a lot of silly soft giggly girly romance) because sex is the only thing that sells nowadays...

If I could give this book a billion gazillion stars, I totally would because it was just that good.

Dr. Rue Siebert is a biotech engineer at Kline, which is one of the most promising start ups in the food industry. Rue Siebert and Tisha Fuli are the very best of best friends, they work at Kline together, but they also share gossip together, Tisha is like Rue\'s right hand wingman, but also the person that Rue can confide in when she\'s doubting herself. Eli Killgore works for Harkness, which is a private equity firm that is trying to crumble the walls of Kline, but for personal reasons alone. For certain reasons, Eli wants to take down Kline to save Rue because the same thing that happened to Eli is happening to Rue right now. Rue and Eli met on an app for hookups, so they decide to have a no strings attached hookup, but soon after spending time together, Eli and Rue are finding themselves falling for one another. When Rue finds out that Eli wants to take down Kline, she\'s completely speechless, but as they spend time together, Eli starts opening up and sharing his personal reasons for demolishing Kline. The secret no strings attached hookup between Rue and Eli has a deadline: the day one of their companies will prevail.Not In Love taught me a personal life lesson, don\'t ALWAYS put your trust in those closest to you because they can back stab you in a heart beat.I absolutely adored Rue and Tisha\'s friendship, they were like two peas in a pod. For your information, yes, Rue isTALL.I absolutely loved the growth Rue had throughout this book, she went from never speaking what was on her mind, to believing in herself when hard times rolled around the corner. The emotional baggage the Rue and Eli both shared was so heart breaking, but I am so proud of each of them for sharing personal stories and overcoming their damage as a team. Rue was always so hesitant to put one foot in front of the other, but Eli was so patient with her and it made me swoon for him even more. No matter what life throws at you, you are always going to need that one specific person to hold your hand as you navigate life\'s obstacles, and I truly loved watching Eli be that person for Rue. Rue had a very dry sense of humor, so the banter between Eli and Rue was always hilarious and Rue\'s dry humor made it a million times better because you just had no clue what was going to come spewing out of her mouth when she was having a conversation with Eli.I just wanted to reach into my kindle and hug both Eli and Rue as they were unpacking their personal life stories full of emotional damage.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Reading this book was like bringing a spoon to a knife fight—utterly unprepared and just hoping for the best.

Eli and Rue were a odd pairing that seemed thrown together and i never connected to Rue and Eli as individuals or together. there’s reasonings as to why they behave the way they do which is understandable due to their pasts, but it still didn’t convince me and just came across like two robots mimicking human interactions to be honest.“She unhinged him. There was something uniquely good about being in her presence.”even though i was aware their situation would be more sex driven than anything else, that doesn’t mean i want to sit through those scenes when they’re written so bland and both characters finish in 5 minutes. Eli was a bit more present than Rue and he did care for her from the start, while Rue took a minute to adjust due to her lack of socialization skills. i wasn’t a fan of the outer conflict either with Rue’s “friend” Florence and the rivalry between them and Eli’s business partners, so most of the book fell flat for me.➙many thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing Group for the arc, all opinions are my own.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'GUYS LMAOOOAOAOAOO???i am sorry but this was her worst book.i mean this with no disrespect. i am being so deadass when i say, i like ali hazelwood. i can appreciate what she was doing with this book, and the fact that she tried something different. however, i personally think she should stick her to usual work. will i read her sports romance? of course my fatass will.the overall story and plot of ""not in love"" was incredibly boring and had very repetitive progression. they LACK chemistry so badly... i mean, i have more romantic feelings for my toilet than rue and eli did for any part of this novel. in addition to that, their interactions had no meaning or feeling, and felt shoved up my ass. the only decent part of this is her writing. i think ali is a good enough author to know how to have a decent flow of dialogue + monologue, & where + how to use it in her stories.now onto the real bullshit~ aka~ the characters ⁀➷➺rue: listen, i tried. if one things for certain, two things for sure—i will always support a woman, but she was written so incredibly dull. there was really nothing to say about her personality or presence because she was just so boring. is there anything particularly wrong with her? i mean, i felt like she was very indecisive and rude to eli, but aside from that, she gave the insert y/n quirky girl. her constantly running away but liking the attention from eli also got hella boring real quick. but hey; at least she was my height, so tall queens unite.➺eli: he was VERY desperate for her, which hear me out. i like when the guy is confident and knows what he wants but here??? this man was lowkey creepy. i don\'t know if anyone else felt like this bitch was demanding way too much for a woman he just met, but i was feeling all the second hand embarrassment for both of them. he was down bad, and it was blaring. this is ali\'s most smut heavy (?) book, and i think all the issues lie there because these two had NO thoughts aside from fucking each other constantly. after a while i was concerned because we know nothing about them, and they knew nothing about each other. he was just doing the most and being hella extra for no damn reason.in addition to this, ali hazelwood does this weird that pisses me off (granted other authors do this too), but here specifically—what is with the fmc getting first person pov & the mmc getting third person??? that was actually so jarring to read. i wouldn\'t even remember that if i were writing it lol. like halfway through, i would forget and start making shit up. sjm does this, rachel gillig, even in bride? it really makes NO sense. in fantasy—maybe? but in contemporary/general fiction? it\'s just unnecessary. coupled with all the back and forth and how quickly they started banging? i was about to DNF, which, i probably should have looking back.➳ lastly, i would insert quotes that i found goofy here, but i don\'t want to look through this damn book ever again.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""ARC provided by the publisher via Libro.fmthis is the first book by ali that i haven't loved and i am really sad about it. i feel like everyone has been begging for her (and emily henry) to give us that dual point of view, but man oh man i wish ali never did. I think a lot of it is because one of our main character’s povs is 1st person, and then the other is 3rd person, and even though i did find a groove while reading, each time i picked up the book it was jarring getting to that groove again.but the basic premise of the stem romance is that one of our main characters, rue, is a biotech engineer who has a passion for fermentation and extending the shelf life of foods because of immense poverty trauma in her past. she is currently working with a company she really loves and she is also working on her own patent for food preservation. after a night with an attempted app hookup that kind of goes really wrong (but also really right despite not hooking up), the next day she goes to work and realizes that this mystery guy, eli, is part of another tech company who is going to buy the loan contract of her current company and that leaves a lot of uncertainty for her and her coworkers/friend’s futures.i see a lot of people disliking this one because of the more explicit sex, so please know that going in, but that truly didn’t bother me. well, maybe it did just because i didn’t love eli in this, so i always would want to be in rue’s head, even during the sex scenes. what i really didn't like (which i didn’t even talk about in the premise because it feels like the only time i was brought up was to further the mc’s love story), is a subplot with rue’s brother that just left a really bad taste in my mouth. i talk in a lot of reviews about how much my little brother means to me, so maybe i was just being extra sensitive, but it just felt really bad to read (and really bad to not really have a conclusion for). and honestly? i felt like the big storylineabout mentor manipulation and lyingwas done much better inlove, theoretically, and felt a lot better for the reader, too.i really enjoyed seeing rue realize that she doesn’t deserve bad things, and her healing and slowly feeling safe in her vulnerability, but besides that? i just couldn’t connect with the romance of this one, on top of the brother storyline not feeling good to read. I still will very much be picking updeep end, but i hope you all enjoy the reading experience ofnot in lovemore than i did.content warnings from the author(please use caution for potential spoilers):I know genre definitions can be a bit blurry, but I consider Not in Love to be an erotic romance, so… lots of sex scenes, explicit and graphic. More than usual. An unnecessary amount, perhaps. It’s how these two emotionally constipated people communicate, at least at the start. Childhood poverty and food insecurity. Anxiety around food, mostly due to past food insecurity. Mentions of addiction (secondary characters). Social anxiety. Parental death (accidents, illness) (off page, in the past). Parental neglect. Power exchange (pre-negotiated, during sex. Attempted assault of the FMC by her brother (she is unharmed). Pregnancy of a secondary character. Cursing and vulgar language.other trigger + content warnings i found while reading(ali's books really do have such good tws - i am always so thankful and impressed): grief, infidelity in past mentions (not mcs) but also a weird comment about cheating made my the mc once, childhood abandonment, one sentence mention of an animal dying during animal testing.blog|instagram|youtube|kofi|spotify|amazon♡The Love Hypothesis★★★★★♡Love, Theoretically★★★★♡Bride★★★★""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""I can't help but wonder if I'm gonna eat up everything Ali writes because that's how my mind is wired, or if so many of the people who said this was their worst book of the year have a little bit exaggerated on the hating front.Don't get me wrong, if someone else - anyone, really - would have written a book with the same plot, I'd probably have disliked it too.But Ali’s narration is just so smooth, and it has improved so much from her first book, and sure, this is definitely something different from her previous books, but I don't see how it's worse.Having a darker narration and being of a different genre didn’t hold me back as much as the main trope, which is the worst and the most senseless of all in my opinion, but I still see how anything that happens is somehow justified.And probably that's enough for me.Also, I've found out I'm incapable of hating any of Ali’s men, and this is pathetic men's season after all.↠3.8 stars""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '✩ 3 stars ✩Hot take from a non doctor: Rue Siebert isn’t shy, she’s on the Autism spectrum. 🫶🏻What to expect:➼ STEM Romance/Women in STEM➼ Forbidden Love➼ No Strings Attached➼ Rivals to Lovers➼ Enemies with Benefits➼ Secret Affair➼ Spice➼ Dual POVNot to let my Counselor side show 😋, but here’s some of the supporting evidence I gathered during my character study of Rue.❖ She’s always felt odd and struggles to connect with people❖ She doesn’t like fiction and claims that made up stories confuse her❖ She enjoys dwelling in facts❖ She struggles to form romantic connections/she lacks interest in forming them❖ She struggles with feelings of inadequacy❖ She struggles to communicate her thoughts and feelings❖ She’s Black & White/ and has a strong sense of Right & Wrong❖ She’s direct/Blunt❖ She’s messy at home❖ She claimed she can’t eat unless she’s sitting down❖ She doesn’t understand the mechanics of petting a dog❖ She works in a STEM field where things would follow very specific concrete stepsMaybe it’s a bit odd to diagnose a fictional character but I can’t help but wonder if the autism coding in this book was intentional. It is very common for women who are neurodivergent to go undiagnosed because they tend to be better at masking and can usually find ways to compensate enough to allow them to be successful in academic/professional settings. The idea that Rue could be unaware of her ASD is not far fetched, but it does bother me a little that Hazelwood hasn’t owned up to this as a writer. This is not the first time she has written a character with autistic traits and I would be lying if I said I hadn’t considered that Hazelwood herself may be on the spectrum. I guess it’s equally possible that AH could be unaware if that were the case. It’s all a lot to think about. Perhaps this book has been less successful in part because Rue didn’t resonate as much with neurotypical readers?Personally, Rue’s character seemed pretty straight forward to me and while I found her to be a little odd (as she so often claimed to be), it was Eli that frequently rubbed me wrong. There were many moments while reading where I wondered what the hell was wrong with him. The things he said to her after she opened up to him about her brother and her childhood were just plain sick. I realize that he maybe said them so that she would relax and stop feeling like she was burdening him, but I still hated every word that came out of his mouth after he said “I’m not hugging you.” His interest in her was lust fueled and mainly focused on sex and almost instantly felt extremely obsessive. So far he has been supportive and protective of her, but I can’t help but wonder what he would do if she decided she didn’t want to be with him. If she wanted to end things between them, I feel like she might end up abducted and locked in a sex dungeon or worse. He honestly gave me the same vibes as the guy from “You” and I struggled to look past that niggling feeling that he was not quite right. It did seem like him and Rue matched each other’s freak 🙃 so hopefully they’ll stay together and we won’t have to find out what he’d do if she tried to leave. 😅Overall, I honestly thought this was a decent read and it ended pretty similarly to most romance books despite the title. I’ve seen others complain about a lack of development in the other aspects of the plot but I didn’t share that sentiment. I thought the two of them were pretty unhinged, but the rest of the plot worked for me. This is definitely not Hazelwood’s best work and I can see why many people haven’t loved it. For me, this was a pretty solid 3 star read. I think it’s time for the STEM aspects of her books to fade to the background, so I’m happy that she has been branching out more lately to other genres.✼\u3000 ҉ \u3000✼\u3000 ҉ \u3000✼\u3000 ҉ \u3000✼\u3000 ҉ \u3000✼\u3000 ҉ \u3000✼\u3000 ҉ \u3000✼I’ve been putting this off since no one seems to be in love with it.

As much as I love reading her books, they could be too much for my overthinking mental state.Now to the romance part of the story. I enjoyed this book. It’s just that I think the physical connection between them overshadowed the emotional one. Also, I’m not a fan of the insta-lust friends with benefits storyline. I agree that sometimes it work, but for the majority of time it doesn’t. I liked Rue so much. And as much as the side plot gave me anxiety, I enjoyed it as well. This wasn’t a bad book, it just wasn’t a personal favourite.Huge Thanks to NetGalley, the publisher, and the author for providing this copy.'}]"

Love on the Brain
",Ali Hazelwood,3.91,519112,5115,"Contemporary, Contemporary Romance, Fiction, Audiobook, Adult, Romance, Chick Lit",368,23-08-2022,"From theNew York Timesbestselling author ofThe Love Hypothesiscomes a new STEMinist rom-com in which a scientist is forced to work on a project with her nemesis—with explosive results.Bee Königswasser lives by a simple code: What would Marie Curie do? If NASA offered her the lead on a neuroengineering project - a literal dream come true - Marie would accept without hesitation. Duh. But the mother of modern physics never had to co-lead with Levi Ward.Sure, Levi is attractive in a tall, dark, and piercing-eyes kind of way. But Levi made his feelings toward Bee very clear in grad school - archenemies work best employed in their own galaxies far, far away.But when her equipment starts to go missing and the staff ignore her, Bee could swear she sees Levi softening into an ally, backing her plays, seconding her ideas... devouring her with those eyes. The possibilities have all her neurons firing.But when it comes time to actually make a move and put her heart on the line, there's only one question that matters: What will Bee Königswasser do?","[{'rating': 1, 'content': 'I mean, are we surprised?I truly did think this would have potential. But, I could tell you that I was 4% in, and that was when I started ranting to one of my roommates, and a friend I (apparently) got back into reading. I read this in less than 24 hours (not for a good reason), and my roommate told me it felt like I ranted to her for four days.I think that says enough.Love on the Brainfollows Bee, a neuroscientist who lives through asking “What would Marie Curie Do,” has just gotten the opportunity to work on a new collaborative project with NASA, a literal dream. But when she opens up to realize she is co-leading it, she didn’t expect to be co-leading it with Levi Ward, her grad school nemesis. But Levi being in the same building as her is one of her most minor problems. Not only did Levi save her on her first day in the lab, but the equipment she needed to conduct her project is also missing. To make matters worse, the staff isn’t paying attention to her, Levi is somehow becoming an ally, and she finds herself exploring these new feelings about Levi’s new alliance that has her questioning herself.I’ll start with the good.UnlikeThe Love Hypothesis, I felt like Bee’s support system did not feel forced, annoying, or frustrating. Her RA was a gen-z hoping to get into John Hopkins and continue pursuing her education. While some of her dialogue sometimes felt forced (as if she had to act like someone her age), she still had a lot of moments where she was realistic, funny, and a supportive friend. There’s also Bee’s twin sister, who, although we don’t know much, we can tell they have a strong sibling bond. Most of their interactions are through the phone, but they’re enough to give us an idea of who her sister is. Here, the exchanges themselves didn’t feel forced, and there were no situations where Bee’s inner circle forced her to do anything. Ahn could learn a thing or two from them.And second, I was glad to see this actually take place in a STEM-related location, specifically a lab to conduct the NASA project.Along with science terms used in every chapter’s title, Levi and Bee’s interactions are primarily in the lab. There are also other scientists, whether working on the same projects as Levi and Bee or not, and a clear representation of who is who. There is a lot of political dialogue hidden through romance and comedy (or an attempt, I guess). We see the gender gap between men and women in STEM, the easiness for men, how women are treated, and the general implications of how much more difficult it is for women.Still, I didn’t necessarily like this. More like,appreciated.And now the bad.The writing ofLove on the Brainisn’t any better thanThe Love Hypothesis. In fact, it felt worse. I don’t pay close attention to perspectives, and I’m not the type of person to not read a book because of it, but this is why the first person is tricky. Granted, if you don’t care much about Bee from the beginning, I think this will be a problem throughout the story because Bee’s voice felt sloppy, childish, and immature, as if Bee were talking to us. Sometimes it felt like I was reading multiple diary entries Bee wrote, which felt very in character because of her few immature tendencies. Unfortunately for me, I wasn’t a fan of her from the beginning, so I was dragging myself as I was reading more than 300 pages of boring characters.LikeThe Love Hypothesis, this lacked a lot of depth. There are a lot of plot devices the author inserts into the book but does not elaborate on them.Since we’re pretty much told everything and shown almost nothing, there are many things the reader is told that add nothing to the story due to zero detail provided to make a theory, add a thought, or understand a point.There’s the example of Levi, who has been going to therapy for years because he grew up in a pretty uncommunicative and not necessarily healthy family environment. He’s now a 32-year-old engineer conducting a massive project at NASA. Yet, there is no further detail on this aspect, which is very unfortunate because the author had the opportunity to provide some sort of awareness for an issue that is pretty big around the world. In other words,the addition of a man who goes to therapy can be a crucial point in a STEM book released in 2022. Yet, it’s weak when you only do it to add a personality or character trait for a character already missing unique characteristics about him.He still lets his parents speak over him, dictating what he should be doing instead of wasting his time or whatnot.I mean, the fact that Bee stood up for him felt rather comical than uplifting.Unwilling to stand up for himself, the scene with his family felt entirely irrelevant to the story. I believe replacing it with a scene about Levi opening up more or talking about himself more to understand better where he comes from could have provided a solid addition to get a different interpretation of him. With the lack of backstory, it can be difficult to understand his actions and interpretations of the world, including his closed feelings for Bee that he hides with a cold glance and supposed hate towards her because he can’t communicate his emotions well. Furthermore, Bee is the kind of character who makes herself the victim. When Levi is opening up himself a little to Bee, telling her more about how his family is and how uncommunicative they are, Bee’s thoughts drift to her sayinghe at least has a family to hold on to,meaning at least he has someone and that he should be thankful because she doesn’t. This wasn’t the first time Bee came off as selfish and rude, as if she’s the only one struggling.I’m not asking for an entire backstory on both characters. Still, there is so little personality on both of them that it feels like I don’t know either character well enough to form an opinion. I still think the author copied and pasted a lot from her debut novel to this, such as how Levi feels like Adam, and Bee feels like Olive. There wasn’t anything new presented for either character, and it felt like I was reading a cardboard copy of both of them. There is also the the amount of inner monologue Bee spends commenting on how big, broody, and hot Levi is (I even tried highlighting all the scenes, but I probably missed some), which is also what Olive did in TLH all the time. One or two times is enough, but commenting on it all the fucking time on every occasion that Bee sees Levi is entirely unnecessary, annoying as fuck, and even astonishing.Do you notice someone’s physique and general physical features THAT much?The sex scenes, while there are three instead of one, were still horrendous, giving second-hand embarrassment, and similar in terms of semantics and getting them there. Bee also said Levi is big, to which he responds, “You’ll get used to it.” The author really said COPY AND PASTE! There’s also how this is described as enemies to lovers or nemeses to lovers, and Levi is described as grumpy, yet those two are not the case. At all. I’m not even going to bother going into detail about how this wasNOTenemies to lovers at all or I will drain myself from my constant disappointment.And now, this is where it gets tricky for me.Levi’s pining that we don’t see from his perspective but are still aware of can be considered of the best parts about this.Clear visuals were evident in how Bee described him, whether through his reactions, inwardly and outwardly, or messages with Bee (who both don’t know who they are). Oblivious to the fact that he likes her, Bee’s inner monologue is formed of intrusive thoughts towards Levi, unknown that Levi is acting the way he is not because she’s unpleasant to him but because he doesn’t know how to be around her. I repeat:CAN be considered the best part.However, maybe it’s just me, but I’m tired of the whole “he likes her, so he’s going to act cold around her and pretend he hates her.” I found it immature and childish, and Levi came off as a middle schooler. As for the “hate,” it was never there. It was gone with a blink of an eye. Between 20-30%, the two were suddenly allies and became friends. This had potential, especially since they were in the same workplace. The opportunity of themactuallyworking together and hating it, yet little by little, they start seeing more about each other, was wasted. Initially, I had thought it would be that way, where the two worked together, with the same equipment and whatnot, and they would slowly but surely start seeing each other in a brighter light. Instead, Bee complains to Levi again, Levi complains about what she complained about, and then he tells her he never actually hated her. Tension? Gone. (Actually, it was never there in the first place).Admittedly, I liked the friendship, and I thought they had a good platonic relationship, but this leads me to my next point. I wasn’t a fan of the romance at all. If the romance had more tension, I could have easily enjoyed this much more. I’m generally a character > plot type of person (Besides, who reads romance for the plot? Romance is the plot).But considering I didn’t really like both main characters here, grew heavily annoyed with the constant and repetitive commentary on the hero’s stance, and felt quite frustrated with the amount of depth missing, it was difficult to root for the romance as well.Personally, the relationship felt much more platonic than romantic. See, despite how romance is the genre I read the most, there are a lot of specific points I look for in almost every romance novel I read. Whether the story has the forbidden trope or not, I’m always looking for those tense moments that add to the chemistry: stolen glances, fingers brushing, hands touching. And if those aren’t included, I appreciate it when the author shows and tells how both characters feel (or, in this case, how Bee was feeling), so the reader can see how they felt. With this not added, it’s hard for me to know where the character is coming from because I don’t evenknowwhere they are coming from. There were hardly any scenes where Bee’s feelings were explicitly stated. Even their sex scenes felt like a friends with benefits situation. Their relationship is slow-burn, which I love, but it felt like they were still in their platonic phase because of how slow it was.This will all come down to interpretation and your form of analysis on how you see the relationship, as it always is with books. It’s a subjective manner. While it’s great that their build-up was slow, that slowness felt like it was still rooted in the friend zone, and therefore the attraction the two were developing towards each other felt like it came out of nowhere. Even though Levi already had a crush on Bee, Bee’s feelings towards him could have used further exploration. There are a couple of scenes where they go out, which is great because I’m always a fan of the two main characters spending time together to get to know each other, but again, there is hardly anything new we learn about them. And when we do, we’re left blankly.As for the ending, there’s a lot to unpack (but not in a good way). First, there’s another copy and paste situation, where a random action was thrown in the last 10% of the book as a very predictable situation turns itself in. Not only that, but before that, there was your traditional miscommunication trope added just to create unnecessary emotion and conflict in the story that could have easily been solved if Bee allowed Levi to show her he was serious. Then, suddenly, after the conflict, there’s the epilogue, which in all honesty, I already forgot. If I weren’t lazy right now, I would open the book and take a peek, but that’s unimportant. It’s irrelevant, just like this book.It may seem like I enjoyed this more than TLH, but I didn’t necessarily enjoy anything here. Personally, enjoyment and appreciation or like are different. While I appreciated and liked some things, I wasn’t enjoying anything. I recall pouring my frustration towards people in my social circle more than in this book. In conclusion,Love on the Brainwill most likely be another Booktok hit that breaks the internet, and people will shower these mid-20-year-olds and early 30-year-olds with praise that shows how low the standards genuinely are.ARC provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""Before we get intoLove On the Brain, I would like to take a second and remind everyone that I gaveThe Love Hypothesis5 whole stars LESS THAN A YEAR AGO. I bring that up because my thoughts here are going to be undeniably ranty and I want to re-establish the fact that I have not been, like, hate-reading Ali Hazelwood from the start. Iwantedto love her sophomore novel, but this was one of the most mind-numbing/soul-crushing/coochie-drying experiences of my life and I have to speak my truth.Here’s the short version: Everything TLH is, LOTB is, but more. If you liked the former, maybe consider giving this one a try. Just know you will be reading the same thing twice (five times if we count the novellas). At this point, it’s clear that Hazelwood is not going to take the initiative to break her own mold. Is she unwilling or incapable? Couldn’t say, but I can tell you her books are suffering as a result. So, if you don’t want to feel like you’re on a never-ending merry-go-round of science puns and quirk, pick one of her titles and go with it, then get off the ride while you still can.Now, onto a more substantial review.Bee might have purple hair and her own version of a PSL-obsession (Marie Curie, anyone?? Haven’t heard of her? Well, you’re about to), but sheisOlive. Levi may have a slightly altered past trauma that causes him to come across as cold and unyielding, but heisAdam. She’s petite, so very teensy, just an itty bitty little dust speck. He’s tall tall tall, with Big Boy muscles and the penis of a goddamn stallion. She’s funky! Loves science! He is strong and silent, but also <3 <3 <3 science!!! It’s tedious. If I wanted to rereadThe Love Hypothesis, I’d simply do it and save myself the headache that comes along with this level of deja vu.The first time I read Ali Hazelwood’s rendition of “enemies” to lovers, I thought it was cute. Now I’m fed up. You’re telling me that an adult man, who leads teams of people and is smart enough to launch rockets (or some other equally impressive space shit), cannot physically STAND to be in the same room as the girl he thinks is pretty? Say what you will about Joshua Templeman, but that man toiled feet away from the woman he fake-hated for months on end without issue. Levi, on the other hand, acts repulsed by Bee’s existence and cowers from her touch, then has the audacity to be shocked when his feelings toward her are questioned. Get a grip and grow the fuck up, my guy. She may be a neuroscientist, but she cannot read your mind. And as much as I love shit-talking fictional men, we can’t exclude Bee from the blame. Miscommunication is one thing, but there’s something so juvenile about the brand of confusion struck up between the couples in this universe. If I had a nickel for every time one of Ali’s protagonists decided to operate based solely on presumed slights and imagined beef, I’d have 25 cents—which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird that it has happened five times.Despite not being a Science Bitch (after almost flunking chemistry in high school I never looked back), I am all for writing about women in STEM. I can appreciate Hazelwood’s passion for the topics she includes in her books and the importance of writing characters who are equally excited about them. I also respect her highlighting of issues that plague the field. However, if major twists in your book can be clocked by a dumbass like me at 4%, because you’ve used them before, that's maybe a sign to re-evaluate your process. And, while we’re talking STEM rep—I’m no expert, but every time a female MC experiences sexism in the workplace, is it really the ‘STEMinist’ move to have her man be the one to swoop in and immediately fix everything for her?The sex. God, it pains me to say this. Up until now, I have been relatively impressed with how Hazelwood writes intimacy. Even the novellas, which were disappointing in almost every way, brought some smut to the table that I thought was worth reading. Someone involved is usually less experienced, but it’s not always the woman and it’s never a big deal. There’s mentions of awkwardness and anxiety, shit that may not be HOT, but are realistic in vulnerable moments. Alas, all that flies out the window with LOTB. As if the book gods knew I was going to be scrounging forcrumbsto praise here and wanted one last laugh, but I digress. I’m not ashamed to say, I was jazzed when I heard this story had three sex scenes to TLH’s one. Now I know better. Ali, m’am, I’ve done nothing but love you, yet you subject me to “he traces the bulge of his cock through the skin of my cheek…” FOR WHAT. I had to read about how Bee is “...some kind of fantasy…built to do this…built for [Levi].” At 28 y/o, she sleeps in a twin bed and is able to fit into clothes from middle school. Her vagina is so small & tight (and hairless! she has gotten her “...chuncha fully waxed every month for years…”) that she nearly blacks out trying to fit Levi’s monster dick inside for the first time. I won’t pretend that these characteristics are unique to Hazelwood’s romances, nor were they entirely exempt from her previous works. But, like I said at the start of this review: LOTB ratchets everything up about a million notches. The objectification and infantilization of Bee made me, quite frankly, uncomfortable. It's shoved down the reader's throat in a way that can't be escaped. Maybe TLH wasn’t the sexiest thing in the world, but Chapter 16 would never hurt me like this book did, that I know for sure.That ending. Not sure who gave it the green light, but what NONSENSE. To be fair, the last 15% of the plot poses the least cause for concern within this whole mess. I just thought I’d mention it’s very “I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren’t for you meddling kids!” and that far too much rides on the existence of a believed-to-be-nonexistent cat. I could also bring up how quickly and conveniently everything was resolved, but I’m too busy reveling in my reaching of the final page to care atm, so I’ll let it go.Let’s end things with the one silver lining I can think of: I read an ARC. An ARC, which I’ve had since January, I think? Meaning,Love On the Brainwill have definitely undergone editing between the version I’m talking about and what is released at the end of August, or at least itshould’ve(Berkeley, if you’re reading this, you’ve got some typos to fix). Anyway, it'll be different in its final form. Maybe even better? Unfortunately, I’ll never know. I’d rather express Schrödinger's anal glands by hand than have to re-experience this book, albeit in a final copy, but I really hope it is…for all of your sakes.""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'At my core, I am a hater.There are many things that seem to fly in the face of this fact (alliteration): My penchant for alliteration and physical inability to not call it out, for one. My deep and profound love of sweet treats and baked goods, which seems characteristic of, like, a small child, or maybe Santa, two figures on the nice end of the optimism scale. My tendency to list vaguely positive things about me.But in truth, I have a hard heart and a mean spirit.I don\'t WANT to be this way. I love loving things! I reread all the time! I\'ve seen About Time more times than I can count, or is reasonably healthy for me based on a variety of surveys and mental health checklists!And so I beat on, a boat against the current, borne back ceaselessly as I try nonstop to find a new favorite romance novel or discover an auto-buy author.Which is why I was so damn excited byThe Love Hypothesis. A book that made me...feel things??? Things that weren\'t rage and masochistic tendencies and a desire to throw a book-shaped object at a wall???A miracle.But, sadly, folks...it appears this miracle is of the fool\'s gold variety. Or that very annoying musical that my high school did my junior year about fake water coming from a fake rock. (Or maybe both were real but the phenomenon was fake? I don\'t know. I tuned it out. My brain is too perfect for musical theater. It\'d be like a grain of sand in a microchip to let that sh*t in there.)Anyway.I thought Ali Hazelwood was a new auto-buy author for me. But it appears she may be...the opposite. Whatever that is.This just wasn\'t it, chief!When an author writes a debut novel, you\'re like. Fun! New! Surely not everything will be like this forever, and in fact this is a nice dose of fresh content, and not an eternal curse or plague of some kind, following me forever and dooming me to a life of making my wrists hurt via the cosmic punishment of typing out a rant review!But alas. Twas not to be with The Love Hypothesis.Because now everygoddamnromancenovelis The Love Hypothesis.Folks, we have been banished to a small eternity in the hellscape that is Huge Man, Tiny Woman.I hate the ""man so huge he take up big chair he make normal thing look little in massive hand he large and strong"" trope almost as much as I hate ""I am so tiny and cute like a little child <3""Ali Hazelwood books cannot function for more than two consecutive paragraphs without inserting both. Add a sh*t-eating determination to make every love interest Dark And Broody And Boring And In Love Quietly For Years with their quirky, colorful-haired, deeply immature and at best adolescent (but really toddler-esque) counterparts...Well, call the reality TV smash hit and hotel rerun darling Shark Tank, because I am out!There is something that is to me very disturbing about this dynamic. It\'s giving: father/daughter. It\'s giving: gross-out. It\'s giving: I\'m going to be sick.I am a tall woman, and I don\'t like dating super-tall and extremely toned men, and so there is no room for me here! I am also a woman with a normal personality, a Roth IRA, and a general ability to take care of my f*cking self, so a weird huge tree man looming in the corner creeping on me for years in order to protect my quirky and so random manic pixie dream girl personality...sounds like a real impediment to my life.Add to this fact that we have to spend the end of this book allowing the author to delude herself into thinking that she can write action sequences, and also that that is in any way what we are here for...It\'s a true NOPE from me.I did not realize I had this much hate in me. Probably at one point I didn\'t. When I first read this, I could see the fun in a man being obsessed with an unknowing woman from afar until she notices him after several years of pining, or appreciate the silliness and idealization and romanticization, and look past how dumb our protagonist is, and ignore that the only character I really liked was a flat background extra whose only personality is being scary and mean (much like myself), and pretend that ENDING never HAPPENED...But then five months passed as I awaited the release date.And I read three godawful novellas in that time.And I didn\'t forget a single thing about this book.And not in the good way, either.Bottom line: A life of hatred it is!---------------currently-reading updatesI GOT AN E-ARC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i am never going to shut up about this ever again.---------------tbr reviewali hazelwood wrote one book and in exchange received my undying loyalty'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Happy pub day 🥳I start my review by giving a big applause for the brilliant person who created this amazing cover!

I loved them so much!Enemies to lovers and friends to lovers themes meet “You’ve got mail” blended in second chances with so much brainy, nerdy references made me giggle at least hundred times!Heartbroken Bee, who was raised by different relatives, bounced from one extended family member to another, lived in a dozen countries! It’s so normal for her to want a secure, stable life that she can put down roots. She’s opposite of her sister Reike who travels around the world, experiencing different lifestyles.And Bee thought she’s finally found the love of her life: Tim might be the ONE she can live happily ever after with but she finds out he’s having an affair with her best friend.But now she got a dreamy job offer: she will work at freaking NASA to lead neuroengineering project : she’s going to work on astronaut helmets! Yes! But when she realizes she’s going to work with grad school arch-nemesis Levi Ward: tall, dark haired, piercing green eyes, a brainy Adonis, she curses her luck!And as soon as she arrives at her work space: she finds out she doesn’t have one: because there’s shipment problem about her equipments and clock is ticking, her superiors force her to show them some scientific results about her project, the very same project she cannot start. And Levi still gives her cold shoulder, never returning to her emails, criticizing her fashion style!She has to confront that man who turns her life into hell by telling him how he makes her feel for years!But what if Levi is not the villain of this story and only thing he wants to do this accomplish their mission by working as equal colleagues. What if Levi’s awkward manners around her doesn’t mean he despises her!Well: I loved the big espionage/ action packed mystery part of the story. Both Levi and Bee were so lovable characters. They keep savoring their happy ending by miscommunication but I loved how their characters evolved!There are some similarities with Adam and Olive’s story ( Love Hypothesis) : how both couple misunderstands each other, how the hero saves the day and hotel room romance parts! But I liked this formula a lot and this book really burned my brain cells with the smartest references: it’s truly so much fun to live inside Bee’s brain and read her whirlwind thoughts, admire her extra nerdy perspective, her vivid, sarcastic tone!So I’m rounding up 4.5 stars to nerdy, spacey, cat lover, funny, quirky, adorable main characters stars!Special thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing this amazing, one of the most anticipated books’ arc copy with me in exchange my honest thoughts.Looking forward to read upcoming geeky romance stories of Ali Hazelwood.medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""i might have accidentally read this entire book in one sitting(thank you to Netgalley and Berkley for the eARC!)I can't express how much I adore this book.Love on the Brainis an addictive, adorable, and swoon-worthy read. It took everything I loved inThe Love Hypothesis(nerdy and relatable characters, a STEM setting, cute romance, and great banter) and added even more.We follow Bee, a neuroscientist who will be working with NASA on a new project: BLINK. I have to admit, I really loved all of the scientific aspects of this book even more than usual, because BLINK deals with transcranial magnetic stimulation, something I've undergone myself and have never really seen mentioned anywhere else. I might have sent many very excited texts whenever it came up.Okay, but onto what everyone probably wants to hear about the most: the romance.It was so perfect!! Levi is an incredible love interest, and by that I mean I am absolutely in love with him. He and Bee went to the same grad school, where his hatred of Bee was known by everyone, for reasons she never quite understood. So when they're forced to co-lead BLINK, Bee must put aside the past to work towards her future. But of course, not everything is what it seems.Their dynamic was so fun to read, and I just really loved them as a couple. But they aren't the only characters in the book. One character that stole every scene she was in was Rocio, Bee's RA. She was such an entertaining character, I genuinely don't know how to describe her other than the fact that she's iconic.In the end, this book was even better than I could have ever hoped.

So when she gets the call from NASA to work on one of their helmet prototypes, it sounds like a dream come true. The only catch: she has to work alongside Levi, her archnemesis from grad school. But as she spends more time with him, she starts to realize that maybe they don't really hate each other after all and it's actually something else altogether.If I had to pick the one thing I enjoyed the most about this book, it isn't the romance. Shocking, I know. Rather, it's the writing. There's something about Ali Hazelwood's style, with its blend of snark and humor, that just completely has me in its thralls. Often I would find myself grinning from cheek to cheek, chuckling to myself while Bee held some amusing and sarcastic conversation or inner dialogue. I think it's because she says all the things I want to say, if only I were quick and clever enough to come up with it.And there were so many puns! Science puns, cat puns, Marie Curie puns. I love me a good pun (or a bad one, I'm not that discerning), so I was in pun-heaven.I have to mention the science in here. I don't know anything about neuroscience, but reading this book made me wish I did. I wanted so badly for the technology in here to be real, so that I could marvel at how cool it is and totally nerd out learning more about it. Add in the NASA/astronaut angle, and your resident space-science fangirl here was swooning.In terms of the romance itself, I enjoyed it, but it wasn't my favorite thing about this book. I found the transition from we're-frenemies to we're-getting-it-on to be a bit sudden. It seemed like they were solidly in the former category, and then all of a sudden, they were in the latter category. I guess I wanted more of a slow progression and steamy anticipation than what I got.Still, the coupling of Bee and Levi was a fun one. Of course due to their previous interactions, Bee would assume that Levi hates her. And of course she'd be slow to figure it out, resulting in rather funny misunderstandings between them. However, I can totally see the pitchforks coming out for this couple—how it's completely unrealistic, how there's no way it would take her this long to come to her senses. I mean, sure, it's unrealistic, but that feels like the entire romance genre to me. It always necessitates a certain suspension of disbelief to enjoy, which totally worked for me here. Your mileage may vary.As an aside, I was checking out some articles about the author (I was super curious about her scientific research), and found out Ali Hazelwood is a pen name. Apparently, in her real life, none of her colleagues or students have mentioned her books to her, so she thinks no one has made the connection yet. Ha, imagine that!At this point, I can safely add Ali Hazelwood to my list of must-read authors. I've loved both of her full-length novels (I'm a little iffier on her novellas, but I'm generally not a fan of novellas). I find her writing style to be supremely entertaining and her focus on science and women in STEM to be refreshing. It's always a joy to dig into one of her stories, and I can't wait for more.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:The Love HypothesisThe STEMinist NovellasUnder One RoofStuck with You~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

It had its moments, ups and downs, but mostly it was The Love Hypothesis, Adam and Olive but call them Levi and Bee.Get ready for a lengthy review cause it's about to get wild af!The book starts off pretty well. The pacing is consistent and of course Ali Hazelwood is a talented writer. She can write a book which you'll find yourself easy to get lost in. The concept is pretty good- guy falls for her first, they're pen pals, based in STEM, etc etc. But while she is talented, she is also lazy-because instead of recycling garbage she recycled the adored script of The Love Hypothesis.I went into this book with an open mind. Had no intentions of comparing it to The Love Hypothesis, but as I started making progress it became quite clear that it is theEXACT same formula as The Love Hypothesis.There's just no denying that. It became harder to not compare the two, so do bear with me. Adam and Olive were so easy to like, their angst came so naturally. The side characters were so full of personality.Love on the Brain, on the other hand discards all that. We getBee,who is supposedly super smart and one of the best. Tell me why does she have to be so dumb in the emotional sense?! It was irritating for me to constantly read how Levi hates her, when the guy could not be more clear in his feelings. He actually even said it!! Also, the fact that she kept interrupting/rambling every time the other person talks to her?? What's that about?! I also did not appreciate her inner monologues. It was overly done and felt like a filler. One more thing, why did she need to wear her grandmother's wedding band on her ring finger? That's just weird.If Hazelwood is like that in reality, I would not get along with her at all. Like her character Bee, she continued to ramble on in the last 100 pages. I'm not even kidding 🥲Coming towardsLevi,I admit I hated him at first, his attitude was quite arrogant which I was not a fan of. But once I got to know him, I liked him, more than Bee. Much more.The two have good chemistry and they're cute together BUT sadly, they could not create the magic that Adam and Olive created.I appreciated the occasional humour in the book, I think Hazelwood writes that quite well. I loved the dm exchange on twitter, it brought the book more depth.My other problem was the fact that Hazelwood made it uncomfortable by forcing, yes forcing, situations which became misogynistic when there's absolutely no requirement to do so. For instance- Levi's playlist. Let the man listen to what he wants without creating an issue Bee. He has already displayed numerous times he's not a misogynist. I get it that there are men who are misogynists, and it is a sad harsh reality but you don't need to bring down men unnecessarily. Don't forget the fact that I am a woman myself. I know what my rights are. I know what I deserve. I know how to make a stand for myself. I know what the reality is. I know how us women struggle. But I also know, I don't have to bring down anyone or any man, especially when the person is doing nothing wrong. I also know not to hate on men without any reason. It's just unnecessary and uncalled for.I hope in the future, Hazelwood writes books with a new hypothesis. The same formula can't work every time when it comes to writing. Love Theoretically is already a let down in my eyes, but I'll give it a go for the cover, which I'm sure will look cute on my bookshelf (I'm weird that way) and that will be it for my experience with the author. While I appreciate that she writes about STEM and especially women in STEM- does she not have any other ideas? Does she not want to put in effort to explore and write something newer? Can she not write anything without the miscommunication trope?If you do want to give this a read, please do so. I hope you love it more than me.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3.25 ⭐️ I didn’t loveee the end but oh well I love Ali and this was fun'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'hi hi HELLO, just wanted you guys to know that there is a list of content notes/trigger warnings for the book on my website ❤️https://alihazelwood.com/lotb-cw/'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '⭐️⭐️⭐️.5/5 starsI am still struggling on whether or not to round up or down, so if my star rating changes just know that\'s me being indecisive af.Even though I didn\'t LOVEEEThe Love HypothesisI did enjoy it overall even though there were some aspects I didn\'t like (the over-the-top SA storyline for one) and I especially liked how fun it was to read.The same is the case forLove on the Brain.Overall I enjoyed many parts of this book and it was fun to read! That being said, there were quite a few things that I did not enjoy and honestly, they were a little bit more unbearable in this book than in TLH because at this point I have read FIVE published works from this author (yes I am counting the novellas as published works since it is technically true despite not being full size novels!)👎 WHAT I DIDN\'T LIKE: 👎*The straight up stupidity of the heroine- and sadly, this isn\'t an anomaly! This seems to be Ali Hazelwood\'s signature! Which I greatly do not enjoy! I love that her heroines work in STEM, but honestly is she giving STEM a good name if ALL of her heroines are incredibly dumb and not emotionally intelligent?!?!?! Decide for yourself because I\'ve already decided and the answer is I FUCKING HATE IT ALL. I truly cannot fathom how her heroines (and sadly Bee is included) are soooo smart when it comes to academia, but not real life. UGH. I truly understand that not everyone is going to see that someone actually likes them when there are so many instances where it looks like they don\'t. But I swear, 4 or 5 mentions PER FUCKING PAGE about how much Levi OBVIOUSLY hated Bee was just soooo fucking over the top and unnecessary.*The ridiculous villains- I hated the SA side plot in TLH (mostly because I am very selective about SA plotlines), but I also did not like the villain side plot in LotB. I won\'t spoil who it is or what happened, but when it was ""revealed"" I literally said ""This is so fucking stupid!"" out loud. Because why? It\'s so fucking stupid. I just don\'t think her books need these ridiculous and over-the-top side plots.*Most of the side characters- Sorry not sorry, but Rocio is annoying as fuck. She\'s incredibly unprofessional and cringey. I didn\'t enjoy any scene that she was in. I also wasn\'t too hip on Bee\'s sister whose name I have already forgotten. So many of their conversations were cringe.👍 SO WHAT DID I ENJOY? 👍*This book read very quickly- almost 400 pages and yet I didn\'t want to stop reading. I was enjoying the ride even though it was quite ridiculous at times.*The tease of Levi redeeming himself- we know it\'s coming!! And I couldn\'t wait for it to happen! And I was satisfied!*The sex scenes!- everyone will have a different opinion, but the sex scenes worked for me although I think they had PIV too early. I would have preferred one more scene where they did some touching/grinding before PIV, but it doesn\'t really matter at the end of the day.*The twitter messages!- possibly spoilers so hiding it here.Although I think anyone with two brain cells would be able to guess that Levi is actually Schmac. Anyway, loved this!!! I especially love that there wasn\'t a plotline where Bee had a crush on Schmac. She liked talking to him for sure, but there was no ""Do I like Levi or do I like this internet friend?!!?!"" Although part of me thinks it would have been so delicious if Levi would have figured it out first based on some VERY OBVIOUS sign that the readers picked up on, but of course not Bee\'s oblivious-ass. Anyway, this was good!🤙 WHAT I DON\'T CARE ABOUT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER 🤙*Big guy/small girl- honestly I consider this to fall under the category of ""don\'t yuck someone\'s yum"". Even though it\'s not my FAVORITE trope I don\'t think this feature of Hazelwood\'s books/novellas warrants all the vitriol it receives. Like it or not, she\'s not doing something ""wrong"" by featuring this in her books. (Fight me!)👏 IN CONCLUSION 👏This book is going to get FUCKING ROASTED and I\'m honestly here for it lmao. All criticisms are valid, especially all criticisms of this fucking book.Despite all of that I did enjoy this book...even if I was constantly irritated lmao. I\'ll continue to read books and novellas by this author, but I seriously SERIOUSLY hope she tries something new with her heroines.-------------------------------------pre-ordered kindle version 1/20/22-------------------------------------THIS COVER IS THE FUCKING CUTEST!!!!! I NEED A POSTER OF IT ON MY WALL. 😍💗-------------------------------------Based on the single chapter preview at the end ofThe Love Hypothesis, this book is going to be a favorite. I already know. There is no information about this book anywhere online yet, but what I gather from the first chapter is STEM + You\'ve Got Mail trope.

At the start, I really didn\'t think it was going to be but genuinely this made me smile and gasp, I was so hooked and couldn\'t put it down.As per Hazelwood\'s STEM theme, this book features Bee, Ph. D, a neuroscientist specialising in brain stimulation with a Marie Curie obsession. She\'s a feminist icon, loves cats, has funky hair colours & many impulse tattoos. She\'s invited to co-lead a NASA project - with her \'nemesis\' (by no means is this an enemies to lovers). This book displays how that all works out, in a cheerful rom com type of way with a surprisinglydark edge.There are so many great themes in this book: the inequities of being a woman in STEM, autonomic nervous system disorders, the unfair nature of admittance to graduate school, family & friendship and of course - learning to love after heartbreak. I enjoyed this so much, and I think I mostly attribute it to the science (although I\'m a biochemist not a neuroscientist) and the realities of higher degree research.⋆ ˚☁️ ⁀➴Plot:For a romance, I was surprised at the balance of plot and character driven aspects. I was genuinely invested on how their research project was going to go, if they were going to beat other people to the punch & if it would be successful. There was also a surprising amount of twists and turns, way more than any other Ali Hazelwood I\'ve read so far, which I really enjoyed.Though the romance was definitely in the front seat. Is this my favourite romance dynamic? I don\'t think so - it was very much one of those times where one of the characters is sort of completely oblivious to the feelings of someone else (which I get; me too). It was a little frustrating to read, but it comes from a place of the characters\' self doubt and post traumatic relationship wounds, which is completely understandable. It\'s a very satisfying ending, and I would like to believe something like this exists in real life. This was atotal he falls first; and for a surprisingly long time,romance.⋆ ˚☁️ ⁀➴Characters:Beeis very \'quirky millennial\' - colourful ombre, loves cats, makes obscure references and is everything pro-woman. I personally couldn\'t relate to her, except for her views on romance. She\'s incredibly intelligent and so precious, she just isn\'t my cup of tea. Poor girl is afflicted with a ANS disorder/syndrome of some kind (me too!) and it was nice to see that representation. She doesn\'t back down from stuffy old men being sexist, which I adore.She talks a lot about ""sausage referencing"" - the whole a woman can have a great idea, say it and no one listens but the second a man says the same thing everyone\'s all ears. Very relatable.Leviis our love interest - he\'s a lead engineer at NASA with an interest in neuroscientist. I might be biased, but because he\'s in STEM he\'s instantly more attractive to me. He\'s the kind of guy you bring home to your parents. He\'s calm, stoic, good with kids, thoughtful and chivalrous in a modern way. There was one chapter where I was genuinely shocked at how attentive and thoughtful this man was, I audibly gasped.⋆ ˚☁️ ⁀➴Writing:Ali Hazelwood\'s writing style is golden. It flows, it\'s easy to digest when you want a lighthearted read to break up your dense Sarah J Mass and stuff like that. It\'s just a rom com vibe. It\'s well paced and addictive - 10/10. She also writes just the best men, you can totally tell they are written by women.⋆ ˚☁️ ⁀➴Enjoyment:I really loved this. It was fun, and really refreshing amongst my current trend of reads. I just really loved the STEM elements, and it was just a warm fuzzy read. Her formulaic stories are starting to get to me though.Would I recommend this?:Absolutely! - 100% ˚˖𓍢ִ໋🦢˚︶︶︶ ⊹ ︶︶︶⠀୨♡୧⠀︶︶︶ ⊹ ︶︶︶₊˚⊹♡ reading log:18/06 1:20pmi am enjoying this so much more than i thought i would17/06 5:40pmthere is some totally valid commentary in here about the inequities in academia and i am all for it17/06 1:15pmit sort of feels like all the STEM ali hazelwood\'s are the same story, just different disciplines of science₊˚⊹♡ pre-reading:so I was reading the nightingale - however then I got sad and find myself spending my whole sunday in bed and a historical fiction wasn\'t really making me feel any better, so as a women in STEM I picked this as a light hopefully cheerful read ˚ 𝜗𝜚˚⋆｡☆'}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""Ever since everyone pointed out how much the author talks about how big the men are and how tiny the girls are, that's all I notice LOL.

I would like to read about different characters from the author though because it is a pretty similar dynamic to her first book with the grumpy/sunshine trope, though this time you get enemies to lovers. The ending kind of took a weird turn into this action scene and I felt meh about that but I don't regret having read it!

She wrote imo one of the best debut romance novel and it blew up and because of that she’s just running with the same characters, the same tropes, the same settings, but different names and it failed. Olive & Adam had a certain charm that Bee & Levi are completely lacking.Tropes:🚀 ‘enemies’-to-lovers🚀 a neuroscientist (h) + an engineer (H)🚀 women in STEM & sexist men in that same field🚀 secret pen pals🚀 smol girl - ginormous guy🚀 quirky heroine – grumpy Hero🚀 Hero is a fucking simp, but shows it in the dumbest way possible🚀 ✨\xa0miscommunication ✨🚀 monster dick🚀 praise kink🚀 catslet’s jump straight to the character talk, cause I cannot summarize the plot of this book even if my life depends on it:– Bee Königswasser (h) –first of all, why is this female character last name named after a chemical compound of acids aka aqua regia and second of all did you know that if you translate Königswasser literally it means ‘royal water’ uhm.. why? i know Bee wants to be Marie Curie so badly, but okay that’s one way to shove science down our throat at every chance.besides Bee’s obsession with Marie Curie, she’s also highkey in love with cats. everytime she was making a cat pun, thinking it’s thepurr-fectresponse a human has ever given, a part of my soul shrivels. don’t come for me, i’m just trying to match her energy. 🤚To be fair, there isn’t much to think about. I only remember up until the moment I fainted. Yes, I swooned in His Wardness’s manly arms like a twentieth-century hysteric with penis envy.if you think WHAT, yeah same. that’s how it was like to be in Miss Royal Water’s head. exhausting.– Levi Ward (H) –facts i know with 100% certainty about Levi:1. he’s tall2. he has green eyes3. he’s TALL (the caps are necessary, how else do i highlight his tallness)4. his eyes are really really green5. he is over 6’2 ft and you’ll get his eyes color if you mix blue and yellow together (look at me bringing kindergarden science into my review, Ali are you proud????)6. he despises Elon Musk7. he’s 6’4 ft tall to be exact8. Levi Green™ eyesi understand that Levi comes from a highly dysfunctional family, has never learned to communicate and it really shows. but boy did he give me and Bee nothing to work with at the beginning with his zero communication skills. we are talking about a man who refused to sit next to his crush bc in his word ‘it was hard to think when you were close’. is it cute that he was so tongue-tied around Bee? sure yeah kinda, but it’s more embarrassing, cause they are ADULTS and not 8.what else is on my notes for Levi: while i don’t really remember that much about Levi as you can tell by that list above, i love how Ali writes her Heroes and how they are pining so hard for the heroine for years. he was simping so hard and we’re all here to see it 💅– romance –Levi and Bee romance pretty much gave me Edward and Bella twilight biology class vibesBee wearing her special dress and Levi acting all too disgusted, but is actually simping hardcore on the inside is the same twilight scene but in different fonts.the first half of this book didn’t really catch my interest that much and it was more in the 2 stars area, bc how much these characters were avoiding each other and couldn’t communicate. but once Levi confessed his obsession with Bee over their anonymous twitter chat it got more better. background info: Bee and Levi both have secret twitter accounts namely @whatwouldmariedo and @shmac where they tweet about hindrances working in STEM and where they talk to each other. they are chatting and Levi as shmac has no problem confessing his unrequired love for Bee to Bee.SHMAC: I know what she smells like. This little freckle on her neck when she pulls up her hair. Her upper lip is a little plumper than the lower. The curve of her wrist, when she holds a pen. It’s wrong, really wrong, but I know the shape of her. I go to sleep thinking about it, and then I wake up, go to work, and she is there, and it’s impossible. I tell her stuff I know she’ll agree to, just to hear her hum back at me. It’s like hot water down my fucking spine. She’s married. She’s brilliant. She trusts me, and all I think about is taking her to my office, stripping her, doing unspeakable things to her. And I want to tell her. I want to tell her that she’s luminous, she’s so bright in my mind, sometimes I can’t focus. Sometimes I forget why I came into the room. I’m distracted. I want to push her against a wall, and I want her to push back. I want to go back in time and punch her stupid husband on the day I met him and then travel back to the future and punch him again. I want to buy her flowers, food, books. I want to hold her hand, and I want to lock her in my bedroom. She’s everything I ever wanted and I want to inject her into my veins and also to never see her again. There’s nothing like her and these feelings, they are fucking intolerable. They were half-asleep while she was gone, but now she’s here and my body thinks it’s a fucking teenager and I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to do. There is nothing I can do, so I’ll just . . . not.man was pouring his heart out and how can you not feel for him and smell his desperation? he thought she was married ffs but was still so obsessed with Bee 💀 when is it my turn where a guy wants to inject me into his veins??? 😔– side characters –where is the petition to see a bonus chapter of Rocia (Bee’s assistant) and Kaylee (Levi’s assistant) having intercourse on Bee’s office desk infront of a camera. I was more invested in the side character and what they were up to compared to the main characters. Ali Hazelwood always manages to write the most hilarious secondary characters and they may be over the top with their personalities, but that’s right up my alley.Rocío’s boots hit the floor. Hard. “I love her,” she declares. “She’s perfect. I want her to be my beautiful California Bride with pink ribbons in her hair. I want to give her bubble baths that smell like cotton candy. I want to buy her fruity cocktails with little umbrellas in them.” She leans forward, pinning me with her gaze. “I will wear glitter for her, Bee. Black glitter.”– same old, same old –we talked about the characters that are the mini version of Olive and Adam, but with even worse communication skills. very similar tropes and vibes to The Love Hypothesis. those are all things that are unexciting, but things that can be overlooked, but recycling scenes again is just lazy writing at this point.i’m talking about the same sex scene whereAdamLevi tellsOliveBee that he wants to fuck her and follows with the question “Can I fuck you?” now, listen besties, i love a consensual king as much as the next person, but i can’t believe we are getting the same dialogue twice. let’s not forget that Levi’s monster cock is so huge that it’s tearing Bee’s vag in half .. does that sound familiar? no? okay hint go read chapter 16 of The Love Hypothesis.moreover, i can’t believe we didn’t get a proper love confession in Love on the Brain either.. that was such a minus point in TLH for me and Ali is repeating the same mistake again that Levi is confessing his love for Bee, but Bee is only thinking it when she says she loves Levi in the epilogue.. did i miss something?? it was so unsatisfying.”I can give you nice. I can give you better than nice. I can give you everything.” He smiles at me, full of hope. “You don’t even have to admit to yourself that you love me, Bee. God knows I love you enough for the both of us. But I need you to stay. I need you to stick around.”that conflict at the end of the book was so fucking dramatic and for what 🤣😭\xa0it was so predictable that some white mediocre dude who was good for nothing was going to be the problem for the heroine, but i didn’t see it coming that Guy (that’s the villain’s name i’m not kidding) was literally pointing a gun at Bee and Levi like the Hulk had to wrestle him to the ground｡･ﾟﾟ･Conclusion･ﾟﾟ･｡was this book a disappointment to read after how much i loved The Love Hypothesis? yup. did i expect anything different? nope. after reading two out of three novellas i knew what i would get myself into cause Ali just loves her miscommunication & tiny quirky girl and huge grumpy guy trope. while this is a formula that works out pretty well for now, i hope that Ali will change it up in future novels, cause she has the potential to be better, otherwise she’s just going to be another Sally Thorne, which is not necessary the worst fate for an romance author, but i made my point.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""2 stars🧠i’m gonna keep this review short and sweet, but there were quite a lot of things i disliked about this book.miscommunicationthis is essentially the foundation of this book. i mean, levi (H) ignoring bee (h) for years and basically running out of the room because he thought bee was married isn’t justifiable and is downright cruel.he practically tried to sabotage her career at every turn. when he wasn’t actively sabotaging it, he was making her think he wasto make matters worse, bee furthered this confusion by wearing her grandmother’s wedding ring…on her ring finger. mind you she didn’t realize he thought she was married, well until she LIED TO HIM ABOUT BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP (multiple times and to other people)like when a guy asks her out on a date and levi replies for her, “oh she’s married”. to which the guy apologizes ‘in case he made her uncomfortable’—“Oh, it’s fine. I’m not\xa0.\xa0.\xa0.” Married, I want to say, but it would be a waste of the amazing out Levi gave me. I cough. “I’m not bothered.”what did this solve? i believe levi finds out at around 50% that she’s not marriedthe crazy part was, i kinda missed the miscommunication as i progressed past the 50% mark 😭 the story just felt very lackluster afterendless cringebee is about as cringey as her name. idk why it didn’t click in my head till 25% that she was named after an insect.i kinda lost it when she started throwing out cat puns when baby talking a kitty—“Aren’t you the most purr-fect little baby? I feel so fur-tunate to have met you.”according to bee, non vegans are banned from eating vegan foods! how dare anyone even attempt to!!!“And one more thing,” I snarl into his stony face. “Vegan donuts are for vegans, you absolute walnut.”i can’t forget the scene where bee scolds levi because he has no female artists on his playlist.“Right.

A minute. “.\xa0.\xa0.\xa0a grand total of zero female-performed songs on your phone.”bestie, maybe if you scrolled for a minute and 1 second you would have found some 🥸this may be surprising for her to learn but some people enjoy genres of music where women didn’t/don’t make big strides in or are hard to findsmutmost lackluster and lazy smut i’ve read by her. you can’t have levi say one “good girl” and expect me to swoon 😒levii’m still looking for his personality 🤨large, colossal, gargantuan, cumbersomeif you took a shot everyone time bee mentioned levi’s size, you would be dead from alcohol poisoning.A face attached to a large, solid body—a body that is pinning me to the wall, a body made of a broad chest and two thighs that could moonlight as redwoods.i can’t really think of a solid reason why i’m giving this 2 stars instead of 1, but i guess it was tolerable enough for me to finish in a few hoursi swear i've read this book before...oh yeah, it’s called the love hypothesis 😴""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '“You were always in my head. And I could never get you out”.Esta reseña es de un ARC digital que me envió Penguin Random House International.Ustedes saben que quedé OBSESIONADA con lo que escribe Ali Hazelwood después de que leíThe Love Hypothesisy se convirtió en uno de los mejores libros de mi año. Ahora, un tiempo después, llegaLove on the Brainy cumple TODAS las expectativas que tenía. Es hermoso,feel-goody tiene una gran dosis de “nos conocemos, pienso que me odias, nos fuerzan a trabajar juntos, hay tensión, nos volvemos sex buddies, creo que no significa nada, pero en el fondo siempre hemos estado enamorados y lo disfrazamos con mala comunicación y odio falso”.Aquí nos encontramos con Bree, una científica obsesionada con Marie Curie a la que de repente le ofrecen el trabajo de su vida como neuroingeniera de un gran proyecto de la NASA. A pesar de que tendrá que mudarse de ciudad y de que se tendrá que reencontrar con Levi, su archienemigo y persona odiada número uno, ella acepta la oportunidad y se lanza de cabeza a este proyecto. Sin embargo, las cosas cuando llega no salen de la mejor manera, se encuentra con mil trabas en este nuevo trabajo y lo peor es que todas se las achaca a Levi, quien cree que la quiere sabotear, hasta que empieza a notar que él la apoya en todas sus decisiones, que la defiende ante un equipo de científicos bastante machista y… que es incapaz de dejar de mirarla ni un segundo.Creo que Ali Hazelwood ha demostrado que es una maestra en crear situaciones de tensión y en alargarlas hasta que se hacen casi dolorosas de leer. Aunque, claro, en medio de toda esta tensión siempre hay pequeños momentos, miradas, palabras con doble sentido y malentendidos que hacen que todo sea increíble todo el tiempo y que lo único que quieras es que los dos protagonistas se queden encerrados en un ascensor y dejen salirlo todo,if you know what I mean.Creo que una de mis cosas favoritas de este libro fue que, además de la historia de la vida real de Bee y Levi, también tenemos una especie de meta-historia twittera con los álter egos de estos dos personajes en redes sociales. ¡Y adoré que fueran tan tontitos como para no darse cuenta de que estaban hablando el uno con el otro! Es más, debo advertirles queLove on the Braintiene el cliché MÁS ENORME de mala comunicación y asunciones erradas del mundo. Literalmente, la relación-no-relación de Bee y Levi avanza y no avanza porque todo el tiempo están pensando que el otro piensa cosas que realmente no está pensando… o que están casados cuando no lo están, lol. A mí normalmente me molesta un montón este cliché, pero en este libro no me desesperó sino que me dio ternurita.En definitiva, creo que me declaro una fan incondicional de las historias de Ali Hazelwood y, como necesito más en mi vida, creo que voy a leer muy pronto las tresnovellasque sacó exclusivamente enebooky audiolibro porque quiero romance en vena en este mismo segundo.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""“My career gasped for air like a hippo with sleep apnea.”so did mine, Bee. In fact, my hands were shaking just typing this up.You might’ve noticed the one star. Let’s get into a nice, long, multiple-page rant review, shall we? 🥰THE SYNOPSIS.Neuroscientist Girl (aka Bee) is hired at NASA for a special project and realizes she has to co-lead a project with grad-school archnemesis Engineer Boy (aka Levi). Drama ensues.THE CHARACTERS.Bee Königswasser.Bee. Oh, Bee. Before I really rip into Miss Bumblebee, let me provide a mere ✨sample✨ of the thoughts and questions from my head as I read this book:13%: Why is Bee wearing her grandmother’s wedding ring when she isn’t married? That’s weird. No one wears wedding rings for luck. That definitely won’t cause misunderstandings later.16%: Why is it such a problem that she and Levi share the same movie taste? More than one person can like theEmpire Strikes Back. This isn’t kindergarten.34%: I’m bored. These two idiots don’t know how to talk to each other.55%: FIFTY-FIVE PERCENT. Why has it taken until FIFTY-FIVE PERCENT FOR THEM TO START COMMUNICATING FINALLY.70%: Did Bee just have a personality transplant? Why does she like Levi so much all of a sudden?75%: WOAH HOLD UP, did we really feel the need to go from 0 to 69?? WHERE WAS THE CONTEXT FOR THIS??76%: Just found out Bee is literally named after a poem about bees. It’s not just a nickname. I can’t with this book.88%: THAT’S THE THIRD ACT CONFLICT? MISS BUMBLEBEE YOU IDIOT—That’s enough of that.Bee, in case you couldn’t infer it already, is a grad school educated idiot. A professional doofus. Why can this girl quickly realize when Mr. Not-Main-Love-Interest asks her out BUT SHE OBVIOUSLY DOESN’T SEE EVEN ONE OF THE VAST NUMBER OF BLUSHES AND FLUSHES AND SWALLOWS AND PANIC MOMENTS THAT LEVI HAS IN HER PRESENCE NO SHE DOES NOT.In addition to her boneheadedness and the fact that she cries at roadkill, trips quirkily, and faints all the time, Bee also has anger management issues.In fact, now that I think about it, all of Ali Hazelwood’s heroines seem to love fantasizing about violently murdering people. Particularly their love interests.With regards to Bee, she thought about poisoning, stabbing, drowning, impaling, and biting Levi at various points. That’s not even counting what she wanted to do to all the side characters.Clearly, a very stable lady.However, the worst thing Bee ever says is the following, (taken from one of her complaints about the lack of females in STEM teams):“The well-known Meatwave. A Dickspolsion in the Testosteroven. The good old Brodeo.”*ahem* now, Bee, I understand you think life is a war against men, and men have done nothing good in the entirety of human history, but—WHERE IS THE BLEACH. I NEED TO THOROUGHLY SCRUB MY BRAIN PLEASE NEVER SAY THAT AGAIN I BEG YOULevi Ward.Nothing to say here. This man was the Ideal Science Gentleman, which means he was Bee’s ideal of what the perfect man should be and the only one who had a reason for his horrible communication skills.THE ROMANCE.Oh, that romance. If one could even call it that. LITERALLY ALL OF THE TENSION WAS A SERIES OF MISUNDERSTANDINGS.THAT IS NOT ✨TENSION✨THAT’S BEING PROUD OF THE COMMUNICATION ISSUES OF A FOUR-YEAR-OLD.For the first half of the book, the only tangible reason Bee is civil to Levi is because of his big, huge, enormous body and those hulking, massive biceps and his huge warm chest and no I’m not being excessive because BEE CANNOT SHUT UP ABOUT HIS BODY.Like ma’am, please be more creative. Lust for huge enormous manly bodies is overdone and not at all connected to actual love.Take these mere snippets:“Is Levi actually handsome? Or is he just six four and built like the Colossus of Rhodes?”“‘Can’t be taller than six two, or shorter than five one.’I briefly contemplate the notion that neither Levi nor I fall within astronaut height requirements, but for dramatically different reasons.”“I stare at this man who’s six four and two hundred pounds of muscle.”“He manages to sound sincere, as though he’s not a six four, two-hundred-pound brickhouse.”“The walls are too high for me to climb—because I’m five feet tall and everything is too high for me to climb.”wow Bee you’re so small and Levi’s so big and you’re so teeny teeny tiny and he’s such a hulking beast and you’re just a dust particle and he’s a dinosaur CAN YOU PLEASE STOP TALKING ABOUT HIS BODYAnd then after the halfway mark, suddenly she adores him and they’ve had all these cute and not totally contrived moments together and they’re 69’ing three bloody times. (side note to those curious: they’re skippable, but don’t read this book anyway not worth it)THE PLOT.Most of the book was talking about this BLINK project they have for NASA. It was actually a pretty cool project, but I'm here to rant so you may read about it elsewhere.First off, why was EVERY SINGLE male character in this book a woman-objectifying trashy dude? (except, rather conveniently, our main man 🙄) Yes, many men steal research ideas and make disgusting comments about women’s bodies. Yes, science is a historically male- and white- dominated field with a great deal of sexism. But this particular subset of male scientists does not represent EVERY SINGLE man on the planet. I don't want to be lectured about gender stereotypes and oppression and misogyny while reading a romance novel. Those things have their place, but NOT ON EVERY OTHER PAGE PLEASE. I’M TRYING TO WATCH PEOPLE FALL IN LOVE.And another thing: women are not all perfect gorgeous angels. In this book, practically everything a female character does is brave, kind, and accommodating, while everything a male character does is aggressive, bigoted, and hateful. I’m more than happy to call out sexism when deserved, but it's hypocritical to call out sexism against women when, if the roles were reversed, you’d be guilty of the exact same thing. Case in point:“I was initially a bit distrustful of him – his bio says “he/him,” and we all know how men on the internet can be.”Well gee Bee, if you'd said—“I was initially a bit distrustful of her – her bio says “she/her,” and we all know how women on the internet can be.”—you’d be called out as a raging misogynist. But because it was about a man, you’re a feminist empowerment queen and 100% in the right.As a woman myself, I’m calling bs 🤦\u200d♀️*sigh* Anyways, that's it. I know I was a little melodramatic, but I’ve been stuck in this girl's head for 368 pages and need a significant amount of therapy. And venting. So that’s what I did here for over four pages.Thanks for listening, y'all, I appreciate it ❤️Ratings:Star Rating: ★☆☆☆☆If This Book Was a Movie Rating: RRecommendations That Are Better Than This Book:The Hating Gameby Sally ThorneFinding Cinderellaby Kia Amazona""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'this was good but not as good as the first book, i wasn’t that interested in the plot of this book. i did like the romance more but at times i found myself bored also it was really annoying how the characters in this book talked. and this book focuses so much on the science and i’m not gonna lie i didn’t care about that shit. it was fine in the love hypothesis but in this book it was like excessive it took me out of the story. i love that the author focuses on women in stem but she should work on a balance on how she writes her science cus girl i’m not trying to read about that, it was i would go read a sci-fi book, im trying read some characters F*CK okay?'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'edit:a friend just brought to my attention that when Ali said galaxy leggings she was actually referring to black holes and so it’s just black leggings 🤷\u200d♀️ and that is now canon to me.At this very moment i wish i was one of those sophisticated reviewers that had fair but true critiques of this book, and don\'t get me wrong there are very many.but this book gives me all the fuzzy feelings as a women in stem so i am willing to ignore all of them.i will ignore the contstant pop culture referances, the galaxy leggins( i cant even 💀), the very infuriating misscomunication, the constant stream of facts about marie curie (yes she is amazing but chill).i will ignore them because i WANT to like this book and i do i love the premise, women in stem the reality of what its like for them in the workplace, and the online friends (i fucking love that trope so much i dont know why, maybe the talking about the girl with no filter ugh i love it) and of course Levi we love a man in stem that recognises that he is the minority and that we need to bring in other people for different perspectives.i could go on and on about women in stem but i won\'t, i dont have the right audiance here so ill leave you with this:""Nothing in life is to be feared; it is only to be understood"" - Marie Curie (as according to google){previous review}Currently running off 4 hours of sleep, i know i will probably never write a proper review for this so here is my half ass try rn.-I loved this book I really did, It made me happy. No it was not a literary masterpiece but I don\'t care at all, I was kicking my feet and giggling as I read Bees and Levis scenes.-I feel like Ali made herself Bee. They both love cats, star wars - Ali wrote a bestselling Reylo fanfic ffs, and dying there hair i think? (is Ali\'s hair dyed, idk) and they both love neuroscience. I feel like she daydreamed her romance (lets be real we all do) but then didn\'t change herself as the main character and wrote and published it.-Yes, this was a repeat of TLH but in my humble opinion, better, smuttier, and more sciencey (yayyyy stem!!!)and it had engineerssorry i love engineering. But if Ali doesnt break that mold its gonna become real old real fast.-Bees character really annoyed me. Levi had to tell miss gurl he didn\'t hate her like 16 times. Girl c\'mon hes loved you since grad school stfu. I would kill to have a Levi and your like this, bish. And she would not shut up about Marie, i dont even know what her last name was because I skipped over whenever she would talk about her. I mean i get it your twitters based off it but woah that got old quick.- There was a scene where Bee said""okay daddy""and i physically couldn\'t do it. I slammed down my kindle and walked around my room because ew, that was disgusting.-AND GUESS WHAT MY FRIENDS WE GOT LESBIANS IN A STEM NOVEL WITH GRUMPY SUNSHINE \'ENEMIES TO LOVERS\' AND GUY OBSESSED WITH GIRL WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO WANT???-Also wanna say that as an aspiring engineer, it was so cool to see where and how everyone worked together and when they worked stuff out to further the project my heart was full of pride. for people on paper. god im pathetic lmao.-And guess what, we got a \'Good girl"" scene. Good god that was hot. I love Levi with all my heart you know what i cant even tell you how much because I love him too much. Him with children and on her side the entire time and that text message that was like a page long (ifykyk) made my heart ache. We need more Levis in the world. But sadly, we have Tims and Guys I hate Tims and Guys. Fuck them.-also guess what i guessed everything that was going to happen at 5% not to brag or anything. lmao. but i still enjoyed it thoroughly- Also I wanna bring up a point I saw on another review on this book by Kat I think her name was. She brought up that in these books its all about women being independent and being a women in stem and not needing a man. And yeah I agree with that. But then the man is always there to get her out of a bad case of sexual harassment, which yup, i know its a romance novel and there\'s gonna be some saving but like, why cant she save herself. Or she could be going well and the guy comes in to \'assist\' not to \'save her\' per se. You know? I just think that that defeats the whole purpose of the novel.✨women in stem✨ (if you have any rec like this plz drop down below)I know Ali will never see this but if you do please consider my advicepeace out friends, i\'m off to get some much needed sleep.{previous review}I am so pissed that I liked this, i had the most amazing review planned out for when i hated itnews flash i didnt, i loved iti just had 4 hours of sleep because i stayed up reading this.......and i have a full day of schoolbut you know what i dont care this book made me warm and fuzzy insideis it like the TLH? Yeah, but is it was still goodit could have been a lot better, its no literary masterpiece but woah did i have the time of my life yesterday(this morning?) anyways i have to go to school nowill write a real review laternotes for that-loved it but/........empowering women (a man saved her?? always relying on him like mentioned in other review?)i feel like ali made herself Bee with her and bees love of Star wars, cats and the fact that they both love star wars, - Ali wrote a fucking Reylo fanfic and published it ffslove it buttt ali needs to break out of the moldstupid bitch he told her he didnt hater her like 5 timesthe okay daddy noWE GOT LESBIANS MY LIFE IS COMPLETEI loved seeing there workplace as I wanna be an engineer, it all sounded so cool.I know this is not a literarry masterpiece but i love it{previous review}This comes out later tonight (where i am at least) i am hoping with all my might that this is different from TLH'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""4.5 stars!! I read this book in less than 24 hours because I loved it that much. Ali Hazelwood writes such fun quirky characters and I love the science/academic world this book takes place in. I've heard a lot of people say this book is very similar to The Love Hypothesis, and although I agree, I loved it SO much. I actually laughed out loud at several parts which is rare for me.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Happy Release Day to Love on the Brain!I received an Advanced Reader Copy for this book in exchange for an honest reviewI don't give five stars often...If you liked the love hypothesis, this book is here to break it's neck, spit on it and bury it under every white cis male who has ever taken credit for a woman's groundbreaking discovery in the history of human kind.I read this is one sitting and I am so pleasantly surprised.Ali has taken her writing to another level, the feminist way she approaches women is STEM isadorably funny.This book is brainy and grindy and I that is why I love it so much. It is SO MUCH more than just a quirky FMC with a brooding male main character, it's a women's science history book. It's a call out to sexist work environments, it's a call out to standardized tests, it's aSAFE PLACE.I have always been a nerdy kid, liking and wanting to be places women were notsupposed to be a part of, video games, sports, dinosaur/archeology/science camps...It is so refreshing to see that someone out there is doing MORE with their romcoms than sticking to the cookie cutter recipe.I am sick and tired of reading the same stories behind different cartoon covers. AliDELIVERED.There are so many reasons I loved this so much but I have to remain spoiler free, but I will say: this is the first time Ali writes a female main character whose voice and personalityI absolutely adore.The side characters in this? Unbelievable.The amount of times she made me laugh out loud? Uncountable.How hard I swooned? Way too hard.Am I desperately in love with this book and Levi? Undoubtedly.A masterpiece.YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST: The same way I knew People We Meet on Vacation was going to win (and I was right) This book is the new winner of the 2022 Goodreads Choice Awards in the romance category.I have no words to describe how much I enjoyed every single page of this book. I'll dare say this is possibly one of my favorite books of 2022 so far.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""**4.5-stars rounded up**The Queen of Steamy-STEM is back and she's done it again!!Without putting too fine a point on it, I'll just say that Hazelwood's stories are the romances of my dreams. I loved this one even more thanThe Love Hypothesis.InLove on the Brainthe Reader is introduced to Bee Königswasser, a neuroscientist, who has just been offered the opportunity to work on the project of her dreams for none other than NASA.Moving to Houston, Bee gets to bring along her dark-ray of moonshine assistant, Rocío, who contributes her own brand of humor to the story. The project is set to run for 3-months, which could turn out to be the greatest 3-months of Bee's career thus far. She's pumped to get started.Then Bee discovers her co-lead on the project is Levi Ward. Ughhhh, way to ruin an entire vibe. Levi is a huge jerk who spurned her at every turn in grad school.Bee never really understood what his deal was with her, but she knows she doesn't want to repeat any of it at this point in her life.Unsurprisingly, as Bee and Rocío attempt to settle in at their new office and get to work, it seems that someone is sabotaging them. Honestly, it's like Levi isn't even trying to hide it, but the longer they're around each other, Bee begins to see a different side to him.Is Levi softening towards her, or was she possibly misreading him all along? Also, if it isn't Levi sabotaging her, who is it?Y'all, I adored this story. From the very first moments in Bee's perspective, I knew I was going to become so connected to her. I adored the way her brain worked, her passions, her backstory, her insecurities, it was all so solidly developed.Then there is Levi, the epitome of a leading man. He's handsome, smart, industrious, athletic, motivated, charming, sweet and a Star Wars fan. I mean, sign me up.I love an Enemies-to-Lovers trope, so I wasn't surprised that I enjoyed this plot. One thing I really appreciated was that most of the miscommunication between the couple is cleared up earlier in the book than is generally the case.This allowed a better building of their relationship in my opinion. Usually you spend so much time just trying to have characters actually communicate with one another, it can get frustrating. I didn't really feel that here. It felt like just the right amount to build tension without causing annoyance.I also really loved the side characters, particularly Rocío, Bee's assistant, and Levi's cat, Schrodinger, because who doesn't love the cats who star in romance stories!?I will say towards the end, there was some silly drama that felt very eye-rolly for me, hence the 4.5-stars rounded up, versus a full-5. With that being said though, that's a pretty minor thing and it was the only time where I was sort of shaken out of the hypnotic trance this story put me in.I have read all of Hazelwood's currently published works and I have enjoyed them all. I love that she is shining a spotlight on women in STEM and that her characters are all so robust and likable.As with many Romance stories, there is a formula to them, but hey, they work. You know what you are getting into when you pick up a Hazelwood book and I'm here for it all the way.Thank you so much to the publisher, Berkley, for providing me with a copy to read and review.This is my favorite Hazelwood yet and I cannot wait to see what she has in store for us next!!""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Special thanks to Edelweiss and the publisher for giving me an ARC of this book for an honest review.HAPPY RELEASE DAY, LOVE ON THE BRAIN!!! 💕AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! I honestly can’t believe I was lucky enough to get to read this book early!!!! What an absolute dream!!!!Love on the Brain was everything I could ever want from a new Ali Hazelwood and more! It was hilarious and angsty and heart-warming and it read like a warm hug feels.The story is told from the perspective of the heroine, neuroscientist and Marie-Curie-obsessed Bee Königswasser (watch me spell that right on the first try!!). Bee has a thing about not getting pets or forming meaningful romantic relationships because all these bonds will end up breaking her heart one way or another. Pets die, people leave, you get it. I feel like some people will find this part of her a little frustrating, but I… completely related? Lol, I can be the exact same way sometimes, which made this book’s message so personal and beautiful to me.Anyway. We also have the man, the myth, the legend, Levi Ward!!! He’s a grumpy engineer who’s hated Bee since grad school for unknown reasons (OR HAS HE???). He likes hummingbirds and Star Wars and a certain Target dress in a certain neuroscientist and THAT’S ALL I’LL SAY ABOUT IT DON’T ASK ME TO ELABORATE!!!!Bee and Levi are paired up to co-lead a project at NASA, which starts out with Levi saving Bee from a fallen piece of machinery and saving her life. But don’t worry, this changes nothing, they still hate each other, so what if he smells like all her deepest fantasies???Watching Bee fall in love with Levi was so beautiful; you can only pretend someone is not your best friend for so long.I guess my one thing with this book would be that there was a certain plot point that felt a little recycled from The Love Hypothesis, which you can pretty much tell right away. But am I complaining? I would NEVER.I truly cannot wait for everyone to read this book and freak out with me. It was SO SO GOOD!!!!!!!Also, final remark: watch out for 47%. Bring all the tissues. 😫❤️ 🥰'}]"
