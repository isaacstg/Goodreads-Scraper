Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, #1)
",Rebecca Yarros,4.57,2232835,4803,"Dragons, Romantasy, Fiction, Audiobook, Fantasy Romance, Magic, New Adult",517,02-05-2023,"Enter the brutal and elite world of a war college for dragon riders...Twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail was supposed to enter the Scribe Quadrant, living a quiet life among books and history. Now, the commanding general—also known as her tough-as-talons mother—has ordered Violet to join the hundreds of candidates striving to become the elite of Navarre:dragon riders.But when you’re smaller than everyone else and your body is brittle, death is only a heartbeat away...because dragons don’t bond to “fragile” humans. They incinerate them.With fewer dragons willing to bond than cadets, most would kill Violet to better their own chances of success. The rest would kill her just for being her mother’s daughter—like Xaden Riorson, the most powerful and ruthless wingleader in the Riders Quadrant.She’ll need every edge her wits can give her just to see the next sunrise.Yet, with every day that passes, the war outside grows more deadly, the kingdom's protective wards are failing, and the death toll continues to rise. Even worse, Violet begins to suspect leadership is hiding a terrible secret.Friends, enemies, lovers. Everyone at Basgiath War College has an agenda—because once you enter, there are only two ways out:graduate or die","[{'rating': 5, 'content': ""#3 Reread - November 2023 - ೃ⁀➷ 5 starsFourth wing(noun) my favourite hello and my hardest goodbye…*#2 Reread - August 2023 - ೃ⁀➷ 5+ stars. . . Mrs Yarros, hmu if u run out of creative ways to carry out dainty boys death trope, I’ve got some amazing ideas. I’ll do u and everyone proud <333Also everything from my first review still stands 😌👑Also pt.2, yes. . . Yes, the ending still hurtWORSEthe second time around 🥰🥰🔫🔫─── ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ ──#𝟭 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗱 - 𝗠𝗮𝘆 𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟯 - ೃ⁀➷ 𝟱 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘀TO ANYONE LISTENING YOU NEED TO GO INTO THIS BOOK AS BLIND AS POSSIBLE I PROMISE ITS GONNA ENHANCE THE EXPERIENCE TENFOLD. ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW IS THAT THIS WILL BE YOUR NEW FAV BOOK FOREVER <3But for everyone else who needs to know…Here’s a quick rundown of the book:it’s about the daughter of a high-ranked general, Violet, getting ordered into learning how to become a dragon rider (but she doesn’t initially want to bc all she’s known are books her entire life) and so she commits to basgiath War collage where she goes through trials designed to root out the weak. She has to figure out how to best everyone and weaponise her strengths. While navigating her feelings for a certain forbidden boi. There’s romance AND (back arching) spice with sparks and tension galore. Also for everyone wondering, the ending isn’t that bad. It’s more of a promising cliffhanger. Makes you feel hopeful rather than making you want to crash and burn everything in your line of sight lmao.*I’m sorry in advance bc this review is gonna be gigantisaourus*wags brows* do you see what I did there?It’s been ages since I’ve loved all the MCs in a book so I deserve to go crazy on the fangirling, leave me alone 🙏This book. THIS BOOK- It gives you EVERYTHING you crave in romantasy. The drama, the characters, the plot, the action, the betrayal, the romance, the tension, THE HOPE THAT THERE ARE STILL AMAZING BOOKS OUT THERE IN THE WORLD-AND IT JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER-There is not a single dry page. Not one. It constantly stimulates your imagination. And there aren’t the usual boring unnecessary bs conversations happening, they’re almost always full of banter and in every chapter, something is happening. It’s fast-paced and that’s something I ADORE about this book.BUT CAN WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE FUCKING TENSION PLS??The addictive chemistry between XadenVi will chew you up, eat you alive and then shit you out, effectively altering the composition of your DNA forevermore😩❤️\u200d🩹The dialogue in this book is so yummy istg I was always giggling and kicking my feet whenever the MCs would interact 🤭💗🦋 they’re both sarcastic funny smart and complement each other sm. I’m telling you this book never left me wanting for anything. There was never a time when I was like ugh the MCs hardly interact or wtv. There’s a perfect amount of every aspect in this book, I’ll never be able to get over it.While reading, it leaves you feeling as though you’ve lost a limb whenever you have to remove yourself from the book to carry out the most trivial inconvenience like feeding and hydrating yourself 😤🔪I'm telling you this book is the only sustenance I need to keep me alive 🙏Violet is me. I am Violet. We are one.No bc she is the most relatable character I’ve read in a long ass time. The way she is so reasonable, empathetic and HAS INTEGRITY. She’s not a pushover. She knows her mind and isn’t afraid to speak it when she feels the need to. There’s no ‘my body is betraying me’ bullshit. Not in this house. I’m in LOVE with violet sfmmm. She owns her feelings and demands what she’s owed. And when Xaden challenges her but she takes it as an incentive to poke and tease him back tenfold is ✨💗🦋🤌Watching her grow and become stronger was one of the most satisfying things about this book. Her character development was elite. She never changed her morals but she always adapts and moves on quickly and I cannot stress enough hm I love that about her.There wasn’t a single moment where I was annoyed at her for being hardheaded. She’s strategic but also carefree. She behaved like a normal 20-year-old would, not older/younger.XADEN is such a seductive menace but he’s MY precious seductive menace.He's always up for a challenge and he SERVES every freaking time. I love everything he has to say. He’s such a lil softy when it comes down to it. Him showing his love through his actions and constantly challenging Vi to do better??It’s the way he never coddles her but also shaves years off his life, worrying about her safety for me 🥹💗🙏😩🦋💞✨🧸I’m always waiting on hands and feet for any interaction with him whether it be his glares 🤭theirnot so shortglances across the classroom 💞his sarcastic quips 💅him being a brooding surly grump😩him being lethally calm 👑him obsessed with her every move 🙏💗Him telling her not to look at him like that bc he only has sm restraint??🤌❤️\u200d🔥 (I have to note that Lance did it better sksksksk) BUT EVERYTHING HE DOES IS HOT PLS-The way I fell for him the first moment he was described?? Everyone is saying how he’s like this guy or that guy from this book and that and I’m just here like idc if he was an amalgamation of every MMC I love?? I DONT CARE BECAUSEIT MADE ME LOVE HIM EVEN MORE👏 I respect Rebecca for plucking the best traits of every fantasy MMC, like don’t be shy put some more 💀✋And there are the dragons but all you need to know is that each one has their personality. They rule themselves. They're the real legends here. And the way this author has weaved them into the book is just MWAH *chefs kiss*The found family in this book is the most precious thing ever.I loved to read how they’re bonded together and I can see that each relationship has the potential to grow into something really special ugh I cannot wait for the next books 😩OkaySPOILERS ahead!!bc your girl gotta scream <33---When Tairn came out of wherever tf he was hiding I was screaming and legit shaking from the adrenaline. I’m still having a hard time accepting how good this book is! I thought she would only get Andarna and I was kinda disappointed bc the moment Tairn got mentioned in that lesson I JUMPED ON THE IDEA OF HIM SO FAST YOU DONT UNDERSTAND. But when he came to save her and Goldie AND THEN SPOKE TO HER IN HER MIND?? I BROKE DOWN AND HOWLED. SO. FUCKING. LOUD.And then Andarna was like “TELL HER MY NAME AS WELL” and I’m- *passes out from yelling so much*I LOVE ANDARNA SFMMM SHES THE MOST ADORABLE CUTE LITTLE SUNSHINE IVE EVER HAD THE PLEASURE TO READ ABOUT 🥹🫂💗😫💞🧸 The light of my life I’m telling you. she must be protected at all costs. (But omg at the end Xaden was like Goldie’s gone huge and I’m here like oop- I NEED TO SEE HER RFN)I love how Tairn is a dad adjacent to Violet 🙏 he’s my grumpiest overprotective pookie 🤭💗with STRONG feelings for his mate skskdhjd (I’m kinda jelly of Sgaeyl ngl)ALSO HOW FUCKING DARE YOU REBECCA!! You ripped my heart out of my chest, gave it a thousand paper cuts and flung it into a volcano for good measure. Liam's death BROKE me🔪 I cried too many fat ugly tears 😭 it was unbearable *shaky breath* but when XADEN found out and cried the cry of all cries?!? Me: (;´༎ຶٹ༎ຶ`) X 100And the fact that her brother is alive made me do a lap around my garden from sheer satisfaction bc I WAS FUCKING RIGHT. 15% in I guessed that he would be alive but he’ll be part of the “wrong” side of the war and it’s been kept a secret bc of the shame/treason and AHHH *does cheerleader flip and cartwheel*And Dain?? That pussy ass lil BITCHHHH- I wasn’t born with enough middle fingers to let you know hm I feel about him. He’s basically Adam from shatter me, and fml bc my reread is just gonna be me wanting to rip his spine out and strangling him w it whenever he speaks 😃🔫But when that inntinnsic called his every thought out to the crowd it was the most hilarious shit ever pls 💀 he’s so pathetic.SPOILERS OVEROne thing I have to say is that this book is not perfect. The action aspect of the book gets a LOT better towards the end imo but the start was a little rusty and needed some finesse but idc idc I’ll take it, faults and all. After all, I’m a character development lover so I can overlook it.BUT THE WORLD BUILDING IS- ヽ(♡‿♡)ノOml the way this author writes leaves you ON THE EDGE WHITE KNUCKLING YOUR SEAT GASPING SHAKING SCREAMING bc you have no idea what will happen next.IT'S THE BIGGEST FLEX TO NOT ONLY OUTDO THE OGS BUT TO EXCEL PHENOMENALLYYYYY AT IT AS WELL 💅✨REBECCA YAROS YOU ARE AN ICON BC I GOBBLED UP EVERY SCENE EVERY CHAPTER EVERY WORD.𝗦𝗶𝗱𝗲 𝗻𝗼𝘁𝗲:I think it’s become my favourite fantasy book ever.

Not once did it feel boring or like I should just skim something, and for once, I know the hype was so worth it! 😩• Spoilers ahead — and I seriously want y\'all to enjoy this book without spoilersThis book is the perfect blend of Fantasy-Romance because it had the spiciest romance scenes with lots of sexual tension and enough twists that will keep you awake the whole night.*Dark circles forming, but anything for XadenVi.*❝The weak don’t survive here, especially not in the Riders Quadrant. The dragons make sure of that.❞In the beginning, Karen aka General Sorrengail, forces Violet to join Rider\'s Quadrant, a place where people become riders and form bonds with dragons.This is in contrast to Violet\'s original plan of following her father\'s path and becoming a scribe, responsible for documenting history. This makes her feeling angry and fearful because the decision is up to her mother, and she has no choice but to agree. She wasn\'t mentally or physically prepared for this challenge and have to do anything to survive.╰┈➤ VIOLET SORRENGAIL AKA VIOLENCE:❝You look all frail and breakable, but you’re really a violent little thing, aren’t you?❞Despite dealing with a chronic illness (ehler\'s danlos syndrome) and having weak joints, she was incredibly awesome and strong! Her personality was so relatable that I felt connected right away.Her anxieties and fears during challenges in the rider\'s quadrant, and how she conquered them with her smarts, were truly inspiring. She showed that knowledge is real power! Her rollercoaster of emotions—fear, anger, desire, happiness—kept me amazed.Even when teased and called weak, she never let anyone walk all over her. And fr, I didn\'t even get that \'oh I\'m so tiny and frail\' or the \'pick me vibes\' as mentioned somewhere because she actually had a illness.I would\'ve dashed for the hills (or the scribe quadrant in Violet\'s situation) when every single cadet was dead set on killing me!It was like half luck, and 25% thanks to the dragon scale corset, and another 25% to Violet\'s intelligence that kept her alive!And - wait XADEN PROTECTED HER WELL TOO! 🤭❝What I lack in strength, I make up for in speed.❞— She kept training and had a lot of improvement and her skills with the daggers were impeccable! landing straight on the target.╰┈➤ XADEN RIORSON:❝Stay the hell away from Xaden Riorson.❞Fantasy men are just FINE AF! From the beginning, he exudes a mysterious aura. Despite the stern lines on his face and a SCAR ON HIS LEFT BROW 🥵, he exudes both danger and allure.His character captivates me so deeply that even if I hadn\'t known he was the mmc, I would have rooted for him.fuck Dain.Xaden comes across as grumpy and ruthless, concealing his emotions behind a stoic facade.However, his interactions with Violet reveal a thoughtful, kind, and trusting side that filled me with so many emotions. It\'s this side of him that I adore. 💞He holds the position of the wing leader of FOURTH WING with great authority. His intelligence and power are remarkable, and don\'t even get me started on the way he walks, talks, and smirks – it leaves me utterly on my knees for him!🧎\u200d♀️His character possesses incredible depth, and I would\'ve loved to have his POV.He\'s a shadow wielder, and just by imagining the shadows around him, his rebellion relic, and his scar — I feel something inside of me! 😮\u200d💨REBECCA ADDED EVERY QUALITY TO MAKE HIM THE HOTTEST CHARACTER! 🤭— Ruthless who? He\'s such a softie....🔪 gave Violet training for sparring matches.🔪 made a saddle for her to be seated on her dragon.🔪 made a custom dagger for her.🔪 killed a room full of cadets who tried to kill Violet, just by using his shadows.🔪 took care of her when she was hurt.🔪 punished a wing leader who tried to kill Violet.╰┈➤ DRAGONS:—So the most sarcasticpersoncreature award goes to TAIRN!🫡God, how much I loved this grumpy broody dragon! He was one of the deadliest and strongest dragons, and he was bonded with none other than Violet! 🤭 His remarks were so sarcastic and savage, and the way he always scoffed and knew about her feelings for Xaden. Hehehe, and he also adores Sgaeyl sm!If he were actually a human, he\'d be so grumpy and possessive, I\'M TELLING YA\'LL! 😂💕❝And to think, I’d almost forgotten just how loquacious humans are.❞Andarna:This cutie goldie dragon—OMF, she was such a cutie! I loved how optimistic and innocent she actually was and possessed great powers, but she was only 2 years old! And the fact that she\'s also bonded with Violet 🥺Sgaeyl:We didn\'t get much about her, though hopefully in the next book, but I\'m so glad she and Tairn are bonded mates! GOD SHE HAS A BRILLIANT TASTE IN MEN. 🥵— ENEMIES TO LOVERS WHERE HE WANTS TO KILL HER? *Sign me up*❝He’s a third-year, and he will kill you the second he finds out who you are.❞Xaden is the son of Fen Riorson, known as THE GREATEST TRAITOR due to his leadership in a rebellion group. Sadly, this resulted in the execution of all rebel group members in front of their children, who were then marked with a relic symbolizing the rebellion.These children were forcibly placed into the Rider\'s Quadrant, where they faced the challenge of survival. The overseeing figure during these executions was none other than General Sorrengail (Violet\'s mother),so they\'re enemies, and he\'s the one who\'s gonnakillhandle her.🤭The enemies-to-lovers approach in this book was really well done.It felt very realistic and stayed true to the idea that \'children shouldn\'t be punished for their parents\' mistakes.\' The kids marked by the relic understood this, and Violet did too. What I especially liked was how Xaden and Violet\'s relationship grew naturally without being burdened by guilt from their pasts.Even though they weren\'t enemies for very long, the book didn\'t rush their journey to becoming lovers. Instead, it skillfully portrayed the gradual development of trust, as well as their decision to let go of their desires, leading them to eventually fall in love. ♥️Violet was super confused by Xaden\'s behavior. Rather than harming her, he encouraged her and saw her potential. He treated her as strong, not fragile, which both confused and intrigued her. 😉❝Going for blood today, are we, Violence?❞After Threshing (where the cadets were bonded with dragons), Violet discovered that Tairn, her dragon, was actually the bonded mate of Sgaeyl, Xaden\'s dragon. This connection tied the four of them together, and if one of them died, they all would. This meant Xaden couldn\'t consider killing her anymore, (not that he had intended to in the first place.) 🥹THE SEXUAL TENSION WAS TENSIONING.🥵 The sexual tension between them was incredibly strong! The heated lust-filled stares, locking eyes, proximity on mats, and more, yet neither wanted to act on it. Their first kiss was incredibly passionate and I was so giddy at that time. There were 3 graphic scenes but Damn they were HOT AF! 🫣🔥❝I am annoyingly aware of everything you do.❞NOT THEM SHATTERING WINDOWS, BREAKING ARMOIRES AND CHAIRS, BURNING CURTAINS AND FORESTS WHILE DOING ✨IT✨.╰┈➤ SIDE CHARACTERS:Rhiannon and Rodic:They were literal babies and I loved how both of them supported Violet! Idk when and how Rodic made his place in my heart but he was so cute. Always adopting humor for every situation and was so calm hehe! 🥺 Am I the only one who wants them together?Like who Tara, Sawyer, or whatever his name is, just give Rhi and Rodic.Sawyer, Imogen, Bodhi, Garrick, Emery, Heaton:I loved how they all became a squad and clearly I would love more of them!Mira Sorrengail:This badass cutie, sexy hot, I love her! 🥵 She\'s so fierce and the best sister ever! 💞Liam Mairi:WE WERE ROBBED OF HIM. I WILL NEVER EVER FORGET HIM, please he was so precious. 🥺😭 I literally cried so much when he died! I already had a feeling that he might die, but god it was so painful. I was so badly hurt when he died. It was so painful to see him dying and then Xaden calling him Brother. My heart broke! I\'m never forgetting that piece of shit Dain.Dain Aetos:This bitch, this traitor, this asshole, what the fuck! Why did he have to go and pull a full traitor-Adam-Kent behavior like bitch fuck off??I actually reasoned with him in the start and ignored him because he was just there to discourage Violet and gaslight her again and again by using \'best friend\' but he so skillfully and fucked-uply betrayed her.IF HE DIDN\'T READ VIOLET\'S MEMORIES (by touching her face) and then not telling his father, LIAM WOULD BE FUCKING ALIVE. FUCK OFF, DAINNN. I WISH YOU GET SCORCHED BY TAIRN! 🤢❝Stop. Fucking. Coddling. Her.❞— yeah, bitch, get that!Jack Barlowe:He was a piece of shit just like Dain and I\'m glad he was Violet\'s first kill, haha served him right! I don\'t want to give him more importance; he was shit AF! His death was so satisfying 😗🤝🏻Long-haired Luca and Traitor Tynan getting scorched was the best thing.General Sorrengail:I dislike her already and I know I\'ll loathe her in the next books, but the only good thing was she trusted that Violet is capable of becoming a rider.Syrena (Flier):She\'s a gryphon rider and had only 2 scenes, but I wish we get to see her in the next books!— some other things:1. I literally choked on my laugh when I read about how smartly Violet won all the sparring matches because she poisoned every player with different types of herbs during the match, and her choosing the breakfast duties to add the poisons in their lunch was such a badass move!It\'s truly proven by Violet that knowledge is power.2. When Dylan died, my heart just stopped for a moment, and I was so horrified when Aurelie died! (Guess I\'m just going to grieve for Liam baby now.)3.All the challenges gave me Squid Game vibes, like all those tasks just to survive and so many deaths each day!Ugh, It was so fun yet horrifying to read. 🤧4.""Fuck, that stubborn, feisty look always makes me want to kiss you.”— these beautiful words!!?? 🤭5. I seriously don\'t even understand how Violet blocked the pain out and got so many stitches every month! I\'d already be on my deathbed 😂6. Am I the only one who couldn\'t — even after reading 3 times — imagine the GAUNTLET scene???? like WTH WAS THAT 😭7.MY TOXIC TRAIT IS THAT I THINK I WOULD\'VE KILLED THE VENIN IF I WERE IN VIOLET\'S PLACE (wth? 💀💀)8. I had doubts about Venins and Wyvern from the start, and gosh, they were horrifying AF!If we want anything to be real, IT\'S FICTIONAL MEN, not these ew!9. GOD, THE END? I\'m still shocked 🥲whjwhsha, I love this book! Ayyayayayaya 🥺 TO MY READING SLUMP.... here I come!!!⤷Ratings.𖥔 ݁ ˖• Fourth Wing — 5 stars• Iron Flame– 3.75 stars• Onyx Storm– tbr'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Edit: for those who do not read the whole review but still feel they are entitled to leave a comment. This is a long review1- it dissects a lot in the book, if this is not a clue for you that there are spoilers then maybe check your IQ.2- For those who are saying ""make it short"" you know you could scrol by and not read right? just take your own advice especially if you love this book and move along to the millions of 5 star reviews3- STOP SAYING NOTHING IS ORIGINAL..I can slap you with at least 20 books written in 2923/2024 that has more originality than this book! We are not asking for a Tolkein level of originality, but if you cannot even come up with your own character description and had to take the literal description from other books (among others) then why are you even called an author?4- in a world that is coming soon to be drowned with AI movies and clips and pictures, I do not want to read an AI book. and I do not mean that the author used AI (Although at this point no one knows), I mean the copy, paste, and stitch from other booksother than that, knock yourself outThe sad reality is this book will probably be GR best fantasy of 2023 though it has NOTHING of the fantasy elementsIf I wanted to read cheap immitation of every other fantasy book then this book it is 😡😡😡😡every time I have an atom of hope that there is something 0.0000001% original, someone casually points out that it\'s not!IMPORTANT NOTE FOR READERS AT THE ENDIs this the future of books? writers shamelessly taking others\' work without even bringing their own to the table and the unknowing masses cheering them on!by now, this has become a game of ""SPOT THE COMMON, AND FIND THE DIFFERENCE""this book does not deserve an ounce of respect and this came after confirming that even the main characters\' descriptions are literally takenPLEASE STOP SAYING THAT NOTHING IS ORIGINAL ANYMORE! YEAH? PROVE ITAND EVEN IF THIS IS TRUE, IF A WRITER FAILS TO BRING AT LEAST 20% ORGININALITY ONTO THEIR BOOK, DO THEY DESERVE TO BE CALLED WRITERS???It is one thing to sample an idea or concept from ""a book"", it is another to take the whole storyline and plot from ""a book"" or in this case ""books"" and make it your own.This book is a memory quiltMade from old stuff to look newIt takes everything that we know as familiar, comfort and nostalgic and weave it together to present it as something new giving you a FAKE sense of enjoymentLet\'s imagine that I am a new reader or someone who never reads fantasy or someone who hasn\'tread and loved the other books mentioned down 👇🏻 I would have absolutely adored this book and considered it one of the best Adult fantasy this year because I knew nothing of them.And surprise surprise! This is what is happeningbut ignorance is not an excuse!Just because you haven\'t read it does not mean it is OK for this book to copy everything!starting this book, I liked that the characters were older than 18. As much as I enjoy YA, sometimes the age just throws me off! However, they still acted like a bunch of 16 and 17 yr.the lingo itself was so cringeimage:I read many YA characters more mature than the main characters in this bookread Ageless and Warda\'s one 1 star review of this book to understand where these characters went wrongThis book attempted to give us a badass female lead that understands that she is flawed, and recognizes her physical incompetence, but does not give a shit. She knows her worth and trusts her intelligence to be her biggest asset so she uses it to get what she wants. She is unapologetic. She knows that if she can’t be cunning, it\'s her life on the line. “I’ll never get over how quickly people move on around here, how callously death is swept under a rug and trampled on minutes later”but, personally, this failed. Because Violet was the typical ""I am weak in the body but somehow I can wip all your asses and accomplish anything"". She is supposed to have a sort of chronic pain that renders her in the disabled category. This is not said out loud in the book. You have to guess it yourself if you are not familiar with the symptoms or learn it from social media. So, it was a role-eye for me seeing her winning every challenge by cheating (which I accepted at first because she was disadvantaged) but then we get no information on how she trained and made herself stronger!. so what was the point of giving her a disability if we cannot see how she overcame it? Also, It was annoying at times seeing Violet practically throwing herself at Xaden like “Pick me, choose me, love me, fuck me”. Girl! Have some dignity. But who can blame her, X is hot and has""Shadow hands, iykyk.... looking at you ACOTAR and ToG fans""and let’s not forget the dragons! I mean who doesn’t love dragons? Throw in dragons with personalities who can hold a conversation and you get yourself a winnerBut these bastards decided with their ever Holly wisdom that a person with a mental disorder (look up Aboulomania) or with a bit of a bitchy attitude is weak and should be scorched to deathI am not going to touch on the characters more than that. Others have explained in detailed reviews the problems with the main leads.And the world building? Excuse me! What world building! If you can answer one question that\'s been nagging me (from the book, not theories) then I\'ll shut up about itA dragon without its rider is a tragedy.\xa0A rider without their dragon is dead.Why? Why is it this way?However, there is abig issuethat is nagging at me and making feel like I am sitting on the most comfortable sofa in the world but someone has put a cushion full of needles at my back. Every time I get a little bit relaxed, a needle pricks my spine or neck or back arm.THIS BOOK HAS NOTHING ORIGINAL AND I DARE ANYONE TO PROVE OTHERWISEWhat this book did is take several old famous ideas from other books and movies, weave it together, and the author simply tailored them with spray edges and a catching cover for bait to come up with a supposedly new book that would please young readers mostly. to quote my friend: ""This book scratches an itchand boy! did this strategy work!This did not sit well with me because :One: the author did not just take from one or two books, she took from several.Two: these ideas were not just inspiration or sampling, in many parts were almost literalThree: copying and sampling are OK as long as the book brings it\'s own added plot or storyline which in this case, Fourth Wing did notWhen I was annotating this book, I marked each time I found an almost literal resemblance to other books. (yellow marks the number)So lets begin (and I am keeping the best or worst to last)Let me begin with the main characters descriptionNo, this is not Violet Sorringale. This is Mare Barrow from Red Queen series. Brown and silver hair and lightning powerAnd the whole ""assumed dead brother who is resurrected and turns out he joined the rebellion""YeahIt\'s like FW has this weird fixation on this seriesbut Violet braids her hair you say! you know who else has silver braided hair and dragons?and how about this one?no this is not Xaden Riorsonthis is either the tall dark and all powerful Rhysand and his Shadow power (and Rhys sacrificed himself for his people, Xaden did as well)or the tall dark and handsome Dorian and his shadow handsBut Xaden has a scar on his face, near his eye more precisely! You know who else tall dark and handsome with an eye scar and rhymes with Xaden!Meadows baby! Our last name is MeadowsNo!? OK, here\'s another tall dark and handsome with scars and is always surrounded by showdows and his name starts with Az and ends with ""are you for real?!""Now, here\'s a trivia for youLet\'s count the number of books where if the guy has Shadow powers the girl gets a control over lighteningJust off the top of my headRed QueenShadow and BonesThe Shadow of Lightening .. etc.Now the plotline1-\tHarry Potter: not talking about magic systems and dragons because many books have those, but “the cadets are thrown into “four wings” upon their arrival, they have to study and compete by gaining “points” and showing skills both physically and mentally.. The literal taking was from p 313 when there is a“tournament”where they had to“retrieve a stolen treasure”to“earn 60 points”2-\tDivergent: I knew that this book was marketed as a combination of Divergent meets Game of Thrones I think, but it took the inspiration too far. I don’t want to read a cheap imitation of Divergent which this book had. The cadets are distributed into quadrants (factions). Violet ends up in the Riders (Dauntless) quadrant where if you show any sign of weakness you are either killed by a fellow cadet or scorched by a dragon!And the Tris/Four moment between Violet and Xaden is also hard to miss. She has a parent/sibling issue, he has a daddy issue. She fantasizes about him all the time (which is nauseating and untasteful at times). Him beating her ass and showing her that he hates her and maybe wants to kill her then ending up saving her life and training her. Even the knife-throwing scene was taken. And it goes on and on3-\tThe Hunger Games: this whole book was the Hunger Games – Dragon Edition. The cadets are literally allowed to kill each other even under the watchful eyes of their superiors. But that is not surprising when the professors so simply snap a cadet’s neck infront of others. I guess “the odds are always stacked against them” yep! This was in the book!And since they are at war and need soldiers, what better way to show how desperate they are than killing off their cadets, instead of sending them off to the other houses 🙄🙄4-\tShatter me/ACOTAR: What are these two series famous for? You guessed it. The predictable love triangle where the first love interest turns out to be a douche and the heroine ends up falling for the dark morally grey character. This is really starting to sound repetitive and obvious.5-\tThrone of Glass (Empire of Storms): Dorian Havilliard has Phantom hands and Xaden has Shadow hands! Both can lift and hold anything with these “hands” and use them during intimate moments. In the beach scene, Aelin and Rowan’s passion fuses their power together and lose control. Same with Vi and X6-\tMulan: (yep! The animation) Mulan shows her strength and proves herself to her camp by using her wit to climb the pole using the weights instead of carrying them to retrieve the arrow and later they use their belts to climb the columns of the palace. The same move Violet uses by planting the rope around the shaft to climb it.7-\tHow to train your dragon: from the description of the dragons, to the lowering of the eyes when meeting one, to the Hiccup and Toothless moment, and the big scarry dragon and the small golden cute one, you cant help noticing these similarities when reading this bookBUT HERE ARE THE MOST OBVIOUS COPY CAT ISSUES8- The plot conflict of the book is the same as Game of ThronesSo instead of the seven kingdoms, Navarre is divided into six but with the province in the east makes it seven! To protect itself, Navarre has built a WARD (wall) around its borders to stop an enemy that we later learn about. This enemy is ruled by a Sage (night king) who creates these venin, monsters that are destroyed only by a special material (valerian steel) which the cadets are forging into blades!people inside the kingdom think that those creatures are just folklore. Venins have the ability to make dragon-like creatures, wyverns, that can breathe BLUE FIRE and dies immediately if their creator diesimage:And the h that has the baddest dragon has silver hair which is always in a braid🙄and thought at first to be fragile and weak!9- Dragon Riders of Pern and Eragon (edited,) I originally related it to Eragon but many friends pointed out that the whole concept of dragon riders bonding with the chosen dragon and that such a dragon can mentally communicate with its rider through witty conversations and big personality is from the mother of all Dragon stories - the Dragonriders of Pern by Anne McCafferyEven the scene where V and X feel horney bec of the Dragon lust is definitely not original to The Fourth Wing10- Dragon School: Just when you think that having Voilet be a Female main lead with a disability is something original of this book, you find out it is not! Dragon School is an acclaimed YA book series by K.L Wilson published in 2017 about sixteen-year-old Amel who joins the Dominion Dragon Riders. But Amel has not only a crippled leg but also chronic disease and Dragon School training is grueling. Before she can even become an initiate, she must complete her First Flight on a dragon. Everyone around Amel thinks she will die before her first ride because of her fragile state and disability. SOUNDS FAMILIAR?Bonus courtesy of @Soyas.ReadingpalaceThis is the map of the Fourth WingThis is the map of the Witcher booksnotice anything?so, there is nothing original about this bookYou want to take the characters\' descriptions? fineoh, you want to take also the plot conflict? finewhat? you want also all the famous plotlines?BUTWhat are you bringing to the table then?????Another side issue that bugged me which was the queer representation. What representation??? I didn’t see any! A representation is when you have a character or a couple of them who are queer. This book made it out as if everyone is Bi and that it is natural for everyone to jump into bed from man to woman. If this is everyone, then this is the norm of the society in the book and there is no representation.I think that this book would be enjoyed by a person who hasn’t read the above-mentioned books or doesn’t want to read them so you get to read a mash-up of them.

She should stay away from him, but a fire burns between these two that is bound to consume them both. \u2060\u2060With stakes this high, every day could be her last.

Mark my words, this is the next big romantasy series!The writing is easy to digest, the world-building is fascinating, the heroine is an underdog and total badass, and the romance develops at a believable pace and is scorching! I laughed. I cried. And I fell in love. This book will forever live in my head rent-free! \u2060Violet Sorrengail is a secret badass!I LOVE her!!!!! She’s a twenty-year-old bookworm who’s expected to live a life as a scribe but now must survive and become a dragon rider. Physically, she’s smaller and frailer than the other cadets in the quadrant, but that doesn’t make her weak. Her mind is her strength and what she needs to survive. I love how Violet handles her situation with courage and grace and how she creates meaningful relationships at the risk of her own heart. She’s extremely relatable, and I can’t wait to see how she grows.Xaden Riorson...this man has easily become one of my top book boyfriends of all time!The son of a traitor, he’s out for revenge against Violet, whose mother led to his father\'s death. From a distance, he’s a scary, scarred, intense anti-hero, but deep down, he’s a man who is loyal, caring, and wise. And the way this man obsesses with Violet….damn. You truly don’t know if he wants to kill or f*ck her, probably both, but yeah, it’s hot! The things I would let this man do to me. 🥵The enemies-to-lovers romance was perfect, with an intense slow burn and eventually spice!I appreciated the time it took for these two to finally get together. And when they finally do, it’s explosive! Thank goodness this is new adult fantasy because the things Xaden says and did go straight to my core, lol.The dragons stole my heart.I don’t want to say too much because it would spoil some of the books, but they are terrifying and amazing!!! They have their own hierarchy and politics, which we don’t see much of since they’re very secretive, but it’s fascinating how they decide to bond with humans to create a symbiotic relationship that ultimately helps protect the land. Can\'t wait to learn more about them in the next book!The found family aspect was done so well!As a dragon rider, you\'re encouraged not to form strong attachments since most people in your school will either die before becoming riders or later on during battle. But Violet goes against this and finds her ride or dies - specifically Rhiannon and Liam! 💕The world building so easy to understand yet very interesting.I’ve never actually read a series focused on dragons and dragon riders, so this was new and exciting for me! It was so interesting learning about the different quadrants - scribe, rider, healer, and infantry - and the schooling required for each. Obviously, this story focuses more on the Riders Quadrant, which honestly is the most exciting because it\'s so intense, challenging, and cutthroat. I personally don’t know if I’d survive, but maybe if I had a friend like Violet, it would be possible!PS: For all you Manon and Abraxos fans out there, you’re going to fall in love with this world!!!For the most part, the story was a bit predictable, but it’s all done in a way that I was entertained and excited to keep reading!I mean, we\'ve seen similar stories where the seemingly weak heroine finds herself in a kill-or-be-killed situation and has to learn to fight and ultimately ends up thriving. So in that regard, you can guess where the story is heading.HOWEVER . . .That ENDING was everything I was not expecting!Those last 50 pages were absolutely epic and blew my fucking mind!!!!!! I DID NOT see that ending coming! I cried and then was left stunned by that last sentence. It\'s a cliffhanger, but it\'ll leave you more in shock instead of in pain, so don\'t be afraid of it! It\'s brutal and will make you want to immediately pick up the next book. Luckily we don\'t have to wait for long since the release date is November 7, 2023!But with everything I love, there are a few things I didn\'t like . . .Sometimes, the wording Violet used to concerning Xaden was a bit repetitive and immature.She kept describing him as beautiful and hot anytime he crossed her mind or showed up. I wish she would have used other words from time to time.The reader has to essentially piece together why Xaden falls for Violet.It’s quickly explained later in the story, but by then, it felt like we were being told more than shown. I would have liked for him to verbalize it more during the story. At least, more than him just saying things like “I can’t stay away from you”or “you’ll be the f*cking death of me”. Every time he\'s say those things, I was like, tell me why, though!Overall, Fourth Wing is an epic story that you will devour! I wouldn’t say this is a perfect 5-star read, maybe it’s closer to 4.5 since it wasn’t ‘perfect’, but honestly, I don\'t care. I haven’t read a fantasy I felt this way about in a long time, so I\'m giving it all the stars.Thank you, Entangled Publishing, for sending me an arc copy in exchange for a review.

I can\'t humanely comprehend how this has a higher rating than Six of Crows. I just can\'t. Here are the things I agree with that everyone has been saying:Good idea,fucking awful, god awful execution.And a little bit of a Shadow and Bone rip off if you ask me.She is supposed to be a scribe. She is forced to become a rider, she gets there, her childhood best friends who has always had feelings for her is mad that she is there, and worried that she won\'t survive. But don\'t worry, because theSHADOW WIELDERbad boy who hates her is there to train her and teach her all about that world. Oh and by the end she ends up being aLIGHTENING WIELDER. There hasn\'t been one in centuries.May the sun summoner bless you Fourth Wing, you\'re about to getroasted.Let\'s get the disability rep talk out of the way, many people told me there was some. And even if there is, the author approached the subject so so so subtlely I honestly couldn\'t even tell it was there. Because the only thing that was actually written was:I am so tiny, I am so weak, I am so fragile, frail, I will crumble. Please, don\'t send me to the dragon riding academy, because I am ramen noodle and I will break and die. Have I also mentioned I am white, pale, and very very very very thin? By the way, I am tiny. I am so smoll. I can\'t even jump on the dragon\'s back I am so small.How will she ever survive?I feel like for people who don’t know that specific disability, she doesn’t give you any insight? Like what does it mean? How does it happen? What is it called? As someone who had never heard of it before it was hard to even notice when she was talking about the disability. It didn’t bring any kind of awareness (which I’d think would be the whole point)Also someone who is this breakable can’t be having wild fucking sex but apparently we forgot about her disability during the sex scenes lmao.But it doesn’t matter because no matter what, everyone wanted to kill her and THERE WAS NO WAY SHE WOULD EVER SURVIVEIn this place where apparently people die daily, like flies. So much danger, so much death, so much struggle. That you don\'t see. You just hear about it because the author got too lazy to actually do any world building. So for the first half of the book there is just a bunch of telling and no showing.But don\'t worry, this frail, little pale, white girl, with white hair will bond not ONE BUT TWO of the rarest most powerful dragons alive. Even if she\'s not even tall enough to jump on their back.Also, enemies to lovers? Where? Where the fuck was that? These two have less chemistry than a priest with a hooker. Her mom is responsible for the death of someone in his family, so he blames her, he wants to kill her, he hates her from the momen the sees her (it lasts about two pages). But every time SHE SEES him, all she can think of is:""He\'s a shark and everyone next to him is a fish"", Dammit I don\'t want to find this asshole hot, but he\'s so hot"", "" ""omg, he calls me violence intead of violet, I am not attracted to toxic men but why do I want to bounce on his dick sooooooooooo bad...""So she basically sounds like a 14 year old valley girl for the entire book.They barely have any significant encounters, all of their interactions are so cringe that it makes me think this book should have been published in 2001. He smells like citrus, he has 107 scars on his back. And he tells her she\'s going to be the death of him every time he gets a chance.""He\'s a very dangerous addiction. Something women will kill for. ""If you catch me killing for men, please, end me first.Anyways, of course we have the most recycled sex dialogue on the plannet.OH GODS - WHICH GOD ARE YOU CALLING OUT FOR ITS JUST ME HERE AND I DONT SHAREThey fall deeply in love with each other, even though they barely interacted throughout the book, barely created a connection and didn\'t even hate each other at all for longer than a couple of pages. She bonds with the most powerful dragons alive, one of her dragons is mated to HIS DRAGON, and every time the dragons get horny SO DO THEY. So they have to learn how to control the hornyness coming from the dragons wanting to fuck.I wish I was joking.The book ends with avery predictable cliffhanger (which is a rip off from Red Queen and Divergent)and now this is one of the best selling books in the world.Watchu gonna do.I guess there is something out there for everyone. Part of me thinks that most people got paid really well to love this book so much. But that would be disingenuous of me to say, because I know people who didn\'t get paid who enjoyed it. So I guess I can see that this book might feel nostalgic.It gives you all the 2001 writing cringe fest, so if you missed reading something like Twilight, you\'ll definitely have fun. The characters are as childish as Zodiac Academy characters, so if you enjoy that, you might have a good time. She steals elements from Harry Potter, Shadow and Bone (most of the plot actually) ACOTAR, and used the writing style and sex scene lines most booktok people love, soBOOM! Best-Seller.Anyways, I am finally fucking free. I think I have learned my lesson and I willl chill on the booktok recommendations for a LONG LONG LONG TIME.She just ""borrowed"" SO FREAKING MUCH from many other popular series that this feels so unoriginal. It almost feels like she threw this book into an AI and said: write me a YA novel and the AI grabbed all the most popular series and put it in there. The sex scenes are all repetitive and recycled. It reads like YA, but it has none of the good aspects from YA, there’s too much sexual content that adds nothing to the plot (and this is supposed to be a fantasy series) So yeah, it\'s a no from me. Too bad as well because the dragons were cool.UPDATE:I was literally going through my old Throne of Glass highlights and found ANOTHER series this author ripped off. Aelin says she wakes up everyday and tells herself she will not be afraid. Guess who does that too in this series? 🤣'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""”there is no me without you.”I. NEED. THE. NEXT.

AM. OBSESSED. WITH. THIS. BOOK.fourth wing had a great mixture between romance and high stakes, this story was giving me major divergent and the hunger games vibes like when i tell you the vibes where there, THEY WERE THERE. it had everything i loved (and dragons) - i haven’t felt this excited about a fantasy book in MONTHS but this was captivating and now i feel a reading slump coming bc of it lmao rip to me. this is a book that is really easy to get into, it’s very fast paced and was engaging right from the beginning to the very end, I WAS HOOKED!! this lives up to the massive hype it’s getting, i get it now.. i could have read this in a day, but i needed to slow it down and savour this book.➳ i found the fantasy and world building easy to understand (there are no dumb info dumps) - so this book is perfect for those who are new to reading fantasy; yarros takes what most other books only manage to allude to and truly brings depth to her story which brings it to life. i got hooked with the whole fantasy war school, quadrants and politics setting. this is a book i want to live in, i want to jump into the pages and never leave!!➳ i understand now when people say it was very predictable bc i guessed that ending from page 1 - however, i would much rather have a predictable book than one that makes no sense bc it is trying to confuse the reader w so much unnecessary shit added into it. this was done in a perfect way.”you look all frail and breakable, but you’re really a violent little thing, aren’t you?”↳violetis probably one of the most incredible FMCs i have read about in a while. i loved her tight bond w her sister, her dragons and the love she has for books. she’s tough, very strong willed, quick witted and not afraid to go the extra mile to succeed. she works through each challenge that is thrown at her by using her strengths and knowledge, and proves she belongs just like everyone else. i loved reading about her journey, seeing her exceed all expectations and break down every barrier she succumbed.— there is an disability representation with the fmc (she has a chronic illness) and the author done an amazing job at showing how her chronic illness doesn’t define her. i love how she shows everyone she is not some frail weakling that constantly needs to be protected.*cough* dain *cough*↳xadenis first introduced as the most powerful wing leader violet is warned to STAY AWAY from. violet had this superstition that he is out to kill her bc her mother had his father executed. but from the get go, we all know as an audience he doesn’t want to kill her, he was so smitten for violet right from the start. that man had weapons custom made for violet that would fit her body type, built a harness for andarna that clips onto tairn just so she could ride along with them and also literally made a saddle for violet to use on tairn so she doesn’t fall off while riding!! i can’t explain how much i love this man and his grumpy exterior but deep down he’s a big softy for those he loves. I JUST LOVE MEN WHO SHOW THEIR LOVE THROUGH ACTIONS!!— i will take no slander on him EVER. he is that typical broody, morally grey love interest ppl roll their eyes over, but he has DEPTH. this man fr had me kicking my feet in the air, giggling and screaming into my pillow whenever he would call violet “violence” 🤭 he is exactly what vi needed!! i just love how he always believed in her and only wants to see her at her full potential and succeed.the romance:oh my goddd, the romance was perfect!! 😮\u200d💨🤌🏼the slow burn?was burning, absolutely delicious.enemies to lovers?SPLENDID, BEAUTIFUL, EXECUTED PERFECTLY. i was itching for xaden and vi sm.the spice?DELECTABLE.

I’m trying to stop reading TikTok popular books, but the rating in this book made me picked it up. Fourth Wing was my first book by Rebecca Yarros, so I didn\'t know what exactly to expect, but at least now I know that it will be my first and last story by this author, because it turned out not to be for me.This review probably won\'t cover all the things I didn\'t like about it, as I started skipping pages after about sixty percent of the book. But without further ado, let\'s finally get to the point of my review—what exactly didn\'t work out for me in this story.The story didn’t hooked me up from the beginning at all. The main reason for this is probably because the writing style didn\'t speak out to me. I actually dnfed it the day before, because of that reason, but decided to give it another chance because I thought it might not be my day for it or maybe I wasn\'t in the right mood after a whole week. At one point I was even glad about this decision, but my enthusiasm didn’t last long. I have to be honest and say that around forty percent of the book I was pretty invested in the story when the dragons finally showed up. Unfortunately, it turned out I was only interested when the dragons were involved. The rest was just boring for me.The second thing is that I felt no connection to the characters. Literally nothing. I must admit that Violet had some great moments, but most of the time I was just embarrassed by her actions. The example.“Glad to see our year apart hasn’t dulled your tongue, Vi.”“Oh,” I toss over my shoulder as we walk into the hallway, “I can do quite a few things with my tongue. You’d be impressed.”That line sounded like a horny frat boy.Also, if you didn’t get it that she was short and tiny, the author kept reminding you of that, because that information was indeed very important.""I’m too short.""“So she’s small.” Mom scans me up and down""""Good gods, I don’t even reach his collarbone.""""I’m shorter than most.""“You’re pretty small for a rider, but it looks like you made it.”""I’m at a disadvantage, that I’m too small to climb its foreleg and mount,""“You’re tiny.” He says it like an insult""""I’m the smallest of our squad""“I’m too short for the ramp,” I whisper to Rhi.""“I’m too short to span the distance!” I hiss, uncaring that anyone could hear us.""\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200eThat\'s only from twenty-six percent of the book. I did not include the rest, because I would not have enough space for the rest of my review.Moving to Xaden—aka, your typical fantasy hero. Seriously. He was your usual tall, black haired, with strong sharp jaw, muscled body, but this time he was riding dragons. I almost forgot, he was""Flaming hot. Scorching hot. Gets-you-into-trouble-and-you-like-it level of hot.""you get the picture. He was also tall. I\'ve written about it before, but we\'ve also been reminded of it a lot. I had to mention that sentence he said here, because I was laughing my ass off at that moment.""You have incredibly touchable skin.”Touchable skin? What does it mean buddy?Honestly, the dragons were more interesting than the main characters here. If the book was about Tairn, I\'d probably be more eager to read it. This dragon had better personality than both of them. At least for me. Tairn was literally my favorite character here. That says a lot about how much I enjoyed this book.The last thing is the romance between Xaden and Violet. This series is supposed to have five books and they already done the deed, are in love—probably because I didn\'t make it to this part, and have a strong connection—again, probably because I didn\'t make it to this part. I thought that at least their first meeting, which is usually quite important, will be more spectacular. But, no. They met in the fourth percent of the book and I was like""Well, that’s it? Already?"". They were supposed to be enemies to lovers, the reasoning behind it made even sense, but they deliverednothing.I felt no chemistry between them, no tension, especially the sexual one, and no hatred that they should feel towards each other as enemies. Almost every time Violet saw Xaden it went like that.""I hate him so much""\u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e""But he is so sexy and beautiful and sexy. And tall.""Not even their first kiss and the cute nickname the hero usually gives the heroine saved them. The first kiss happened after Violet found out that they could feel when their dragons banged.Yes, they could feel their dragons banging.This information made me feel quite uncomfortable. Extremely even. I know they could get rid of that with some magic or whatever, but just why? The nickname ""Violence"" that Xaden called Violet was tacky and the book could easily have survived without it. Not to mention this line.""you’re really a violent little thing, aren’t you?”My only thought wasFrom Blood and Ash. It sounds damn similar. Even though I only read the first book from this series.Moving forward to the things I liked.The dragons.Ending my review, all I will say is that I am pretty sad and disappointed that I didn’t end up liking this book. I wanted to start a new fantasy series that I would be obsessed with, but I guess we can\'t have everything we want. I’m happy for people who loved it though. Good for you guys.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'If I had a million dollars for every cliche in this book, of which there are a multitude, I\'d still regret spending $20 on all 498 pages of this mess.Spoilers to follow :)Let\'s start with the worldbuilding!Now, this book had two things I love dearly: dragons, and an academic setting. Yarros, however, explains almost every element of her world so poorly and sporadically that the entire story feels as though it were concocted page by page. The hierarchy of squadrons and sections and wings is so unnecessarily confusing. The whole ""war"" going on along the border is so vague, it was obvious from the start that some twist was going to reveal the good guys were actually the bad guys all along. The author\'s primary method of exposition is dropping pieces of information into conversations that feel forced and completely unnatural. No one talks like that. No one shares information like that.Now, the writing!The sentence constructions alone were enough to give me a headache. I can\'t tell you how many times I had to reread entire paragraphs because of poorly written and run-on sentences. As for the dialogue, let\'s discuss the fact that everyone talks like it\'s 2023, despite the medieval setting. I\'m not kidding, the female character asks herself at least twice, using these exact words, ""Is it toxic that I like this guy even though he can kill me?"" Yes. Yes it is. And so is all this internal monologuing. Please, end my suffering. Apart from the sentences and dialogue, the descriptions were severely lacking. Every location felt like a vague impression rather than an actual place. I don\'t think I\'ve ever encountered a book suffering from white room syndrome quite like this one.Now for the characters. Oh, the characters.Starting with the main event, we have frail young Violet who is SO relatable because she\'s SO clumsy and SO bad at things! Simultaneously, she is SO smart (like smarter than everyone) and SO unique that she gets not one, but TWO dragons to bond with her! And of course, they\'re both the rarest kind of dragons that exist!!! And naturally, everyone wants her dead for... reasons. But does her life being in danger give her any sense of self control? Absolutely not! She argues with everyone and throws her sass around to both peers and superior officers with little to no consequence. This woman has the survival skills of a fruit fly!! Additionally, her moods go back and forth quicker than an Olympic ping-pong match. First she hates Xaden because he\'s a traitor. Then she loves Xaden because she decides to trust him. Then she hates Xaden because he\'s a traitor. I\'m expecting the cycle will continue in Book 2. Also, she starts off wanting to be a scribe and gets pissed when she\'s thrown into the Rider\'s Quadrant, then she decides she desperately wants to be a Rider because... because? The decision is given hardly any explanation or emotional weight.And then there\'s discount Rhsysand. Oh wow, the moody black-haired rebel with tattoos is actually the good guy. Shocking. He\'s hard on the outside, but a softie on the inside. Groundbreaking. Also, the way that Yarros writes his character from Violet\'s perspective is downright sickening at times. From the very first scene with him, Violet\'s internal thoughts about Xaden are grossly objectifying. Everything is about his body, and how hot he is, and how badly she wants to sleep with him. There\'s an entire scene spanning two pages where Violet and another woman are straight-up ogling shirtless Xaden while he\'s sparring with another guy. It\'s disgusting. If the roles were reversed, if a male author wrote about a male character viewing a woman in the same way, heads would be rolling. It\'s gross, and frankly one of the most disappointing things about this book.Honestly, none of the other characters were interesting enough to write about. The dragons were fine, and probably the most likeable. Sawyer was the only human I found tolerable. Dain was just annoying, as he was clearly meant to be.Now, the plot.The majority of this book was consumed by Violet being horny and a random series of challenges. There was no explanation anywhere of what the academic year would look like, which makes me think the author was just making up more challenges and battles and war games as she went along. All of this, of course, leading up to a real challenge where we find out information that was abundantly obvious from the start. Oh no, the good guys are the bad guys. The bad guys are the good guys. The dead brother is actually alive. I wish I cared about any of this, but I don\'t because it\'s been so blatantly obvious since the first chapter. The pacing of this book was tedious in a lot of places because there wasn\'t really any kind of looming threat beyond the vague allusions to bigger attacks along the border. Nothing in this book surprised me. Nothing came even remotely close. Everything was so over-ridden with cliches and ideas from other books (mainly Divergent, and a little bit of Red Queen with the not-dead-brother ending) that nothing felt original or creative at all.I have searched earnestly, to the farthest hills on the horizon, for something good in this book. Alas, I return to my homeland empty-handed.And here\'s the thing: I so desperately wanted to enjoy this book, which makes it all the more disappointing. If you\'ve made it this far, I want you to know I did not approach this book with the intention of feeling this way. If you enjoyed this book, kudos to you. Feel free to keep on enjoying it. These are just my thoughts and opinions, and I\'ll content myself to be the cranky grandma of Goodreads if need be.

I am in loveeeeee, easily the best book I read this year and one of the best romantasy I\'ve read in a while.

All she needs to do is not get killed and bond with a dragon, but it\'s not as easy. Not only she has to escape the clutches of the students who want her dead, with few dragons willing to bond; she also has to keep away fromXaden, MMCwho wants her dead.From page 1 till page 633 I was hooked. Theworld buildingis detailed and well thought out. Theplotis consistent and true to itself. Thepacing,fluctuates a bit in the second half but mostly stays fast paced for the majority of the book.""Tell me what you\'re thinking?""""I was thinking you are exactly as I predicted the first time you took me in my room.""""Oh yeah? And what was that?""""A very dangerous addiction.""Coming to thecharacters-⚡Violet-I loved her. She\'s brave, compassionate, goes to lengths to protect others and knows how to stand up for herself and others. Having had chronic illness, people always underestimate her(all but one)but that\'s what makes her an underdog. I liked how balanced her character and personality was, never over the top. Loved following her journey through the war school and boy how she developed and grew in those pages.🖤Xaden-Idk if anyone else is saying this but I will- Xaden has the same vibe that Warwick from Savage Lands does, but Xaden does it better. There\'s just something about their personality that\'s so similar. Give the Savage Lands series a go if you liked Xaden. Anyway, I loved him so much. He\'s a badass. Once her started opening up, and we got to see the softer side of him- I was swooning. He\'s powerful, sexy, and knows when to pick his battles, certainly not a push over.Dain-What an ass. Radiates the same energy as Tamlin in ACOMAF.The othersupporting charactersare good as well, they grow on ya- especially the dragons and Liam. Tairn and Adarana have my heart. I loved them since the first time they spoke. They have a sense of humour, are badass and protect so fiercely. Saegyl was okay-ish, not much of her tbh.Now I want a dragon 😭""I\'m going to keep you.

And if you like thecharacters being jealous,you\'ll enjoy that trope here too. I do think there was a pinch of ""who did this to you"" but wasn\'t that impactful. Xaden and Violet\'schemistryis off the charts. They compliment each other so well and I like how open and honest they are with each other, and that both of them don\'t hold each other back and give the other room to make mistakes, learn and grow. It is a mature relationship yeah. Also, thesmutwas hot.. no seriously, things did get hot and broken down 🤭Theendingwas an emotional rollercoaster. I was crying so much at one point, had to take deep breaths to resume reading. I cannot wait for the sequel 🤩It\'s such a masterpiece in my opinion.

You can\'t help but root for her as the quintessential underdog bc she never lets herself be a victim despite her physical limitations.

Of my time and money.I can’t decide whether to rate this 2 or 1 ⭐️.It’s a 1 ⭐️ rating. 🤦🏾\u200d♀️I’m about to drop some truth bombs,so if this is the type of book for you in where you don’t want to hear any form of slander, then look away.I’m going to be honest about my reading experience, which wasn’t all that great.😓It seems that fantasy romances, whether they’re adult or YA, have been using the same formula these past few years in where the focus solely lies on the plot and the action scenes and the same attention isn’t given to the characters and their world. And I do not understand why that is the case. The balance between them all is off.The characters (all of them, not a single one was interesting) lacked substance, background and history. So by nature, I’m not even remotely interested in rooting for them and seeing them overcome the challenges they’re facing, because they are so poorly developed to begin with.The foundation of this world felt unbelievably flimsy and read messy to me. It was supposed to feel dangerous, the stakes were supposed to be high. Characters were being killed left, right and centre and the only thing I felt was nothing.There was no order to the way it was being built upon. Just chaos, convenience and stupidity all round.Violet’s character could’ve been made more interesting (to me) if:▪️We had we seen her time as a scribe before she was forced to become a rider.▪️See her actually train and get stronger.▪️See how she generally fought through her chronic pain.▪️See her deal with the grief of her brother.▪️Explore the weird dynamic she has with her mother.▪️See the friendships forming and the romance truly developing.▪️See her fuckin’ bonding with those dragons.All of these things would’ve added nuance and depth to her characterisation, to the actual story itself. Are we privy to any of that? No. Those aspects are mentioned and that’s supposed to be good enough whereas I would’ve liked layers.Characters shouldn’t read so one-dimensional.And enemies-to-lovers where? Please. 🙄 This trope was used in the most juvenile way.You could argue that the romance itself was juvenile.We could’ve honed in on the hate since both these characters suffered losses, come from different and opposing backgrounds, have some real animosity and tension built between them but the love interest was hardly ever present.Next thing you know, the trope was flung out the window instead of it being morphed into something real.So, I fail to understand why this was sold as a fantasy romance.I can’t tell you why these two liked each other, let alone love. There was no development ofgenuine, romantic feelings.There was a buildup of attraction and supposed sexual tension. But that’s it.Another thing that bugged me is that we only got Violet’s perspective. I mean, this occasionally works, but ideally,no fantasy book should have a singular POV.I can’t begin to tell you how boring that narrative is.It gives such a limiting and subjective view of the world and the characters, and this especially gets more limiting when there are other characters present that also play a significant role in the story.Yet they weren’t utilised.Is it that hard to give different perspectives?The dragons were theONLYinteresting parts about this whole book.But they didn’t even get as much page time as they should’ve. They deserved more page time. I mean, if you’re going to have them talking, give them a POV as least. They could’ve told us about their own history.There were also some language choices that were made that felt odd in a fantasy setting.“Personally, I’m not arguing with their logic, just enjoying the view…respectfully, of course…”“So. Freaking. Beautiful.”“Holy. Fuckin. Hot.”No one talks like that in a fantasy world. 😒You know damn well some of this lingo doesn’t belong here. It’s so embarrassing and a testament to bad writing and bad editing.To top it all off, I still don’t know whether this was adult, new adult or YA fantasy. I couldn’t tell you. Goodreads has them all listed. Clearly, everyone is confused.In conclusion, all of this to say that this brand of poorly written, poorly developed fantasy story is just not for me. This book was not for me. I had a really difficult time immersing myself into the story.The ending was somewhat interesting, but by that point I was skim-reading. And I don’t care about this book enough to continue on with the series. I want to forget I ever read it.I’m avoiding all hyped books for the foreseeable future. 😪💔'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '0/5⭐️😍 OMG THIS IS THE (second) WORST BOOK IVE EVER READ IN MY ENTIRE EXISTENCE!!!🥰I’ve posted my iron flame review!! You can go read it if you liked this one :)Violet Sorrengail. Get it? SOARING-GALE BECAUSE DRAGONS SOAR ON GALES 🧍🏻\u200d♀️ THATS SO CLEVER.She’s like so badass because she’s like so dainty and like so small and has insert name chronic illness which makes her so badass and a really good candidate for a WAR SCHOOL. She is totally not a self-insert of the author because unlike the author she doesn’t have blonde hair, she has ultra special brown hair that turns a really rare silver as she gets older. (Because hair pigment works like that🤭)She’s also so super really fast because she’s SOO petite and small and little and fragile.And also the love interest is SOO much bigger than her and he’s the most powerful darkness-wielding highlord—oh sorry I mean dragon rider at the academy.because Violet being the daughter of the literal leader of the school wasn’t enough, she also gets a super mega rare giant black dragon AND a never-before-seen golden useless ass feathertailed baby dragon that has the ability to manipulate time. And don’t worry, Violet can summon lightning just in case you were concerned that Mare Barrow was the most obnoxious lightning wielder.Rebecca Yarrows is such a good writer 😍 all of her world building and info dumps are so unbearable to read!! Plus her writing is entirely YA and juvenile except for the horrific car crash level sex scenes that happen 80% into the book. What a slay!!All of her characters make me want to rip my eyeballs out🥰 but especially Xaden because he’s so tortured and scary and so much bigger than our poor baby fragile pathetic paper-boned protagonist Violet soaring-gale.The enemies to lovers is also so well done!! They were literally never even enemies😍 and I didn’t once believe they felt anything other than the most surface level lust for the other🤭Also why the fuck did Yarrows decide that when the dragons fuck that their riders also get really horny? That was information I did not ever need.The world building was so amazingly perfect!! I loved how she info dumped entire paragraphs of exposition and random facts onto us, but still never managed to outline how the actual school worked or why the fuck the gryphons couldn’t just be incinerated by the giant ass dragons with literal magic!!!!😍Oh, I also really enjoyed how the single black character with any personality was not only bisexual but hyper sexual and slept around with everyone!!! It was really great how Rhiannon was sidelined the entire novel so that Violet could also be useless!I also love how we don’t get to know anything about any of the side characters because Violet is too concerned with fucking Xaden!! 🥵The nickname of “Violence” for Violet, the character that literally did not kill a single person until the 75% mark also made a lot of sense!! I’m so glad she was at a war school and wasn’t required to kill a single person or even ever actually train without cheating her way through by poisoning her opponents!! She will totally not die in actual combat when she can’t sneak random ass made-up poisons into her opponents’ meals!! 😝I think it’s also so inspiring how Violet’s tiny 90 pound frame literally could not support swinging an 11 pound sword, but the dragons did not murder her for being weak (her words not mine) because she was so strong mentally because she complained about being in pain (despite claiming to be used to pain?) and so delicate and fragile all the time!! 🤩Also let’s just not talk about how Violet totally plays into the “toxic perseverance” trope by actively ignoring the symptoms and effects her disability has on her body and powers through everything because she’s “used to pain”!! That’s so good and such a good example to set <3It could have been interesting if Violet actually found ways to accommodate for her weaknesses/disadvantages that made sense, but clearly Yarros doesn’t actually give a fuck so she didn’t bother. The only example we have of this is a saddle which I’m sorry is stupid as fuck because why was everyone not already using saddles?? Did Miss Rebecca ever look into how fucking uncomfortable it can be not use a saddle or padding while riding horses much less consider how painful it might be to ride a giant, roughly scaled DRAGON that is FLYING THROUGH THE SKY?? 🙈This book was so incredible😍 I can’t believe booktok didn’t force this down everyone’s throats sooner!! It was so great to read this horrendous amalgamation of shitty world building, horrifically atrocious writing, and one dimensional characters with a nonsensical plot and a underdeveloped romance!!Legitimately the worst book I’ve ever read. I would unkindly ask Rebecca Yarros to never write another word in her life.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '— 5 stars ✰I LOVE YOU REBECCA YARROS”you gave me your heart, and i’m keeping it.i knew i was going to love this book. the amount of five star reviews & the talk aboutfourth wingon social media had me intrigued since the beginning & i’mhappyto confirm that this book is indeed worth the hype. like, mind-blowing-amazing 🫡dragon, dragon-school, competition, tension, enemies to lovers, you get thrown right into the plot, you have amazing antagonists. this book was purelyperfection. everything your heart desires, you’ll get it. nothing better than a fantasy novel with a subplot of romance, a good plot twist and am amazing cliffhanger. yes, you heard correctly. a cliffhanger. i might die right here right then because how am i supposed to wait that long for the sequel to come out?PLS GIVE ME THE SEQUEL NOW!! 🫠🫠—xadenriorsen. the man of the hour. the moment he appeared, i fell in love with him. i might be exaggerating but who cares, right? it’s the way violet describes him, i mean, how could you not fall in love with a brooding dragon rider who has a cut through his eyebrow. what makes him even hotter is the fact that he is the leader of the forth wing and oh my god, his “welcoming” speech.. i don’t know how yarros managed to make himthishot in a few sentences only. it’s his confidence. yes, that must be it. totally not his broad shoulders. or his rank. or his dark hair.“i had it made for you.” his lips curve slightly.his love language has to be acts of service. this man might have taken a while to admit his feelings but the things he did for violet? unbelievable. he was so ruined for her & i was so ready for it.—violet, my beloved. i justlovedhow everyone underestimated her and then she showed them what’s beneath that “fragile” body everyone seems to think she has. what i enjoyed most about her was that we saw her development, saw her fight for the place in the school and proving everyone wrong. she has a good sense of humor and wit, making me giggle — especially when she was flirting with a certain someone.“there’s a fucking smirk onxaden’s arrogant, handsome face.”there were so many chapters i enjoyed that were purely about violet without any mention of xaden & that means so much to me. there have been so many fantasy books were i was just so bored out of my mind when the love interest wasn’t there bc not everyone knows how to write a badass fmc with a great personality. rebecca yarros absolutely nailed it tho. the plot is just so gripping, you get sucked into their story and just want to read more about their world.as i am a big fan of game of thrones & house of the dragons, this book was a total hit for me. i loved reading about the dragons, the different breeds, their history, their shape and color and abilities.—xaden and violet. violet and xaden. you know who they reminded of? tris and four. the young new girl everyone scoffs at, the intimidating older guy everyone fears. also let’s not forget that xaden was the only person mira told violet to stay away from 🤭 their first interactions were so full of tension already, i was giggling and blushing and they’ve only changed a few words by then.”going for blood today, are we, violence?”did i mention that we get a training scene? but like a really hot, full of tension, angsty, fighting scene. she attacks him, he catches her fist, she tries again, he pulls her back against his chest, she jumps him, he pins her down. i could go on and on and on, believe me, it was really freaking hot.we even get a “let-me-see-your-injuries“ scene and if you thought the fighting scene was impeccable, then you have to read about this one. jaw? on the floor 💗💞🩷💕💘”there is no me without you.”—dain, what a hypocrite. you know who this ass reminds me of? adam kent and freaking gale hawthorne. i get that he wants to protect violet but he’s holding her back unlike xaden who wants her to unravel and become stronger. speaking of that, they remind me so much of warnette in that matter. i’m not done, they’re even torydarius coded. i loved seeing their relationship develop in a long time span. days pass, weeks pass, months pass. it’s not like they were enemies and then suddenly a week later they decided to like each other, nope, it definitely took them weeks to even admit their connection. they might be enemies to the core but who doesn’t love a good old enemies to lovers?alsojackreminded me so much of cato hadley from the hunger games. i know he’s evil and all that but every books needs a cato. and he got we deserved soooPLS I NEED THE NEXT BOOK AS OF NOW 💥💥'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3.5 🌟OK SO I GOT PLAYED A LITTLE!!!!THE GOODThis was a HIGHLY enjoyable book. I had so much uni work to do, but I still flew through it. The author wasted no time – she made a fast-paced, action-packed, well established fantasy world. I love how we got introduced to bits and aspects of this world slowly, she really KNEW how to world build, how to ease us into this complicated setting. AT EVERY POINT OF THIS BOOK I knew what was going on, who I was rooting for, what are the aims of the particular scene. And you, my fellow fantasy readers, know how that doesn’t always happen. Like I said in the updates, EVERY SINGLE PAGE WAS A PLOT POINT and no fill-ins. I hate it when writers drag the story, you can really tell when they do that, and fantasy authors are for some reason prone to doing that. This wasn’t such a book. It’s not that long (around 400 pages) and I wasn’t bored in any scene. I love how the story intensified towards the end, but the stakes were high throughout the WHOLE THING.THAT Xaden CHAPTER ATEATEATEATE, I LOVED IT SO MUCH!AND THAT PLOT TWIST IT ENDED ON, I COULD NEVER EVEN IMAGINE THAT HAPPENING! UGH, I can’t wait for the next book.THE BADI said it before, WILL SAY IT AGAIN, this is the most formulaic book I’ve read in my life. You know when popular musicians make songs SPECIFICALLY so they can become popular on TikTok and you SOMEHOW ALWAYS KNOW. Yes, this was that, but for books. You can really tell the author used EVERY SINGLE TROPE she knows people love and will eat up and put it in her book (enemies to lovers, mated pairs, the whole rebellion trope, I’m the chosen one but I don’t want to be that blablabla), I just couldn’t get past that fact. Before reading this book I saw a few posts saying how this book is similar to ACOTAR. When I just started it, I didn’t really see the resemblance, but THEN I GOT IT. Dain is SOOOO Tamlin coded, Xaden is basically Rhysand, again the rebellion thing, THE MATES THING (god I hate that so much). I wouldn’t call this a carbon copy of ACOTAR, but you can’t tell me it wasn’t loosely inspired by it (for the sole purpose of satisfying booktok).This was in no way original, and that’s the number one thing I didn’t like about this book. There wasn’t a single thing happening, a plot point, a scene, a character trait, that I haven’t seen before. This plays into this being EXTREMELY FORMULAIC.For those who read it, is it just me? (I know it isn’t)THE DRAGONS WERE SO FUNNY. I’m sorry, I didn’t like the dragons. I liked them individually (as almost characters) BUT they WERE IN NO WAY WELL WRITTEN. They’re supposed to be these mysterious, dangerous, sacred creatures, but Violet’s dragon says the word FUCK at one point. I LAUGHED SO MUCH, HAD ME ON THE FLOOR.THE CHARACTERSUgh, they’re supposed to be adults, but they’re SO YA CODED. You can’t tell me Violet is 20.Surprisingly, I liked the protagonists, but individually. They’re both flawed, but also with a sense of moral, a great combination of characteristics. However, them as a couple, not really. The banter was there in the beginning but then it just evaporated. They went from being enemies to LOVERS THE PLANET HASN’T SEEN so quickly. They were enemies for a good chunk of pages, I must admit that, but the change was in no way gradual (pls go to the Mariana Zapata slow burn school k thanks).(And also, Violet was so desperate with the L word, GIRLIE STAND UP!!!)The spice was good ngl (had me kicking my feet lol)I LOVED THE SIDE CHARACTERS. RHIANNON AND LIAM (sorrows sorrows prayers) HAVE MY HEART.FINAL THOUGHTSThis was a fast-paced, highly enjoyable first book in the series I will for sure continue reading when the next installment is out. It wasn’t very memorable and won’t make the FAVORITES list, but I still had fun reading. I’m leaving room for improvement.Is it overhyped, tell me in the comments??? (let’s have a respectful discussion)💕💕'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'if y’all see me on the news tomorrow it’s because i broke into this author’s house and tried to steal the manuscript for the sequel…i can’t even begin to describe the attachment and love i have for this book and its characters. it’s one of my favorite books of all time now. the author really wrote the most heart wrenching, emotionally loaded, appetite terminating sentences and said “deal with it.”to put into few words: this new adult fantasy romance book is set at a war college, there’s dragons, and there’s 2 main opposing sides that hate one another. our fmc belonging to one and our mmc belonging to the other. i think you can see where this is going…WRONG because you could have 30 guns pointing at my head and i still wouldn’t have predicted THAT last sentence. all my brain matter would cover the wall behind me.Violet aka Violence (iykyk) is my favorite character all around. she’s just like me for real. the way she thinks and talks. she’s really a girls girl. i usually prefer dual pov but not in this case. being in her head made me realize i’ve never had an original thought. she’s a fmc written by a woman to its core. she strong, resilient, a fucking genius, badass, witty af, compassionate, and so damn attractive…god idk if i wanna be her or be with her… everything she goes through and overcomes made me shed a tear or 7. she’s unpredictable and that’s what i love about her.Xaden…i’ve never read a man described so damn sexy. i was in heat and prepared to do a line off this man’s stomach…his middle name is basically “self control” and the way that crumbles from just the mere existence of Violet. he says it best when “i’m annoyingly aware of everything you do…”i appreciated how he has a personality outside of the slow (and i mean slow) burn romance. he’s protective but not overbearing. he’s idealistic and charming without even trying. he “hates” her but literally had daggers made for her specific body shape and fit. he had a saddle made for her body type so she doesn’t fall off her dragon. he’s so thoughtful and attentive, it comes natural to him like breathing. the longing that’s in his eyes when he simply glances at violet (you’d think he’d be plotting her death from an outsider looking in) was written like poetry. Violet has him so tightly wrapped around her finger and they can’t even begin to understand the depths of it…one would think the romance would be my hyper fixation for this book but it’s not even that (not only that.) it’s the fucking dragons! the way they are described, have personalities of their own, the way they always check and roast Violet had me LOLing and giddy. the bonds they have with their riders felt as real as oxygen in the air! 😮\u200d💨some quotes that aren’t spoilery but still had me barking like a dog in heat:👹“heat rushes through every vein, wakes every nerve ending. I hate the reaction of my body to the site of him, but I can’t deny it. His appeal is so fucking inconvenient.” she is so me coded“i know how to handle a corset” and he does“There’s a palpable energy in every room, he enters, and brushes over my skin, like a caress each time our eyes meet. Even now, I’m aware of every breath he takes, as he sits next to me midway down the table.”“fuck, that stubborn, feisty look always makes me want to kiss you.” god he’s so miserable 😩the MCs and dragons dynamic is so uniquely and well written like nothing else i’ve read. it’s so ying and yang coded. this book, in short, is a limb to me. cut it off, i bleed out and die! it is diverse, rich, deep, magnificently written, and every fiber of me loves it (i say all of this referring to a piece of media that ruined my life🥲)'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""This is kinda harsh but my honest opinion after reading the ARC ~** May 2023 edit: I'm a bookseller and read a variety of genres including children's and YA. My issues are not with these genres. My issues are with books that read as clumsy, horny (and not in a fun camp way), and unpolished. Which in my Personal Opinion(tm)!!!!!!!!!! this book is.It's pretty stock standard commercial horny hetero fiction. That's fine. Can't please everyone. I'll be totally honest: if you don't care that much about quality of writing and want an easy het romance-fantasy novel à la Cassandra Clare et al. (nothing wrong with that!), you may enjoy this. It's not my thing, though, and I can't recommend it if you want a decent wholemeal fantasy novel to sink your teeth into. **I found this disappointing and I’m frankly shocked it has such glowing early reviews.To be fair, my disappointment is partly caused by the misleading blurb and ARC marketing. The blurb implies a high stakes military fantasy set at a war college for dragon riders; this put me in mind of Temeraire, The Poppy War, or even elements of The Hunger Games. Romance is mentioned - “traitors will become allies… or lovers” - but it’s certainly not implied to be wholly a romance novel.I saw on the author’s instagram that this is being marketed as a “new adult fantasy” - if 'new adult' just means ‘lacking the sophistication of genre fiction but can’t be marketed as YA romance because of sex scenes’… then, sure, call it 'new adult'.All the characters - even supposed high-ranking military figures - speak like millennials from the year 2023. Why was the word ‘vibe’ used so many times? As in, ‘his vibe is weird’. But in other ways the setting recalls medieval Europe? Who edited this???I would not have picked this up if the marketing more accurately reflected the content. It’s 100% a romance novel in the vein of Cassandra Claire, Sarah J. Maas, the Divergent series; any genuine stakes are basically subplot to the central romance. The oh-so-important ~tension~ could be resolved by just… talking to one another? Most other world building elements are underdeveloped & confusing, full of plot holes, and everyone’s dialogue is set up to give the protagonist & ~dark~ love interest perfect Marvel-esque quips and one-liners. I get that this is a popular thing but to me it lacks sophistication and polish of contemporary fantasy :-)Also, my certified transgender opinion (tm) is that the inclusion of a random nonbinary side character was disingenuous and definitely tokenism, lol.The reason for two stars instead of one is because I found the representation of the protagonist's disability - and how it was navigated in such physically demanding settings - genuinely interesting.All in all, this, to me, read like a semi-edited fanfic. If that’s your thing, go buckwild. Otherwise, I can’t really recommend it. The blurb is pretty misleading, imo. Expect a YA romance novel.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '""Decide, Violet. Are you going to die a scribe? Or live as a rider?""Oh, this is good. I see now why y\'all love it so much.IfFourth Wingwere a drug, I\'d be an addict. It grabbed me so thoroughly from the very first moment and refused to let go. I was fully immersed, I didn\'t want to sleep, didn\'t want to eat. I just wanted to inhale it as fast as I could. And honestly, isn\'t this why we read, for this exact feeling?The action begins right on the first page and never lets up. There was no onerous worldbuilding, no endless backgrounds or introductions. We just seamlessly slip into the world of Navarre and Violet Sorrengail. Every time I get the itch to read fantasy, the one thing that holds me back is how much worldbuilding I would have to endure just to get to the good parts. But no such issues here. The good parts start right at the beginning.Is this the most original story? No. Is this the most well written? Also no. (Don\'t kill me for saying that, all you rabid fans.) In fact, the dialogue has me cringing at times, with its penchant for f-bombs as emphasis and its often basic but slightly pompous back-and-forth that only teenagers can pull off. I guess in that way, it is true to its characters since they\'re all not much older than teenagers.But slight criticisms aside, this story is executed to perfection. It takes several well-trodden tropes and not only cohesively blends them together, but also manages to squeeze every ounce of entertainment out of them along the way. And I\'m not above being entertained.This is my first real foray into the romantasy genre that\'s got everyone aflutter. And I can see the appeal. Fantasy is a bit of an adrenaline rush and so is romance, so blending the two together is really the perfect symbiosis. Of course you\'d want your hero to fight hard in a war between good and evil. And it totally makes sense that they would love hard too if they could die any day. And if the object of desire is one\'s enemy instead of one\'s friend? Even better.I\'m a little late to theFourth Wingparty, and there\'s good reason. I was certain this was a duology (don\'t ask me why I thought this), so I figured if I just held off a little bit, I could bam my way through both books without having to stop and deal with the inevitable anguish of waiting for the next book.

So many great descriptive words and all this author can do is spout curse words. Curse words do not a personality make. Neither is being a horny 13 year old.

But Threshing was only the first impossible test meant to weed out the weak-willed, the unworthy, and the unlucky.Now the real training begins, and Violet’s already wondering how she’ll get through. It’s not just that it’s grueling and maliciously brutal, or even that it’s designed to stretch the riders’ capacity for pain beyond endurance. It’s the new vice commandant, who’s made it his personal mission to teach Violet exactly how powerless she is–unless she betrays the man she loves.Although Violet’s body might be weaker and frailer than everyone else’s, she still has her wits—and a will of iron. And leadership is forgetting the most important lesson Basgiath has taught her: Dragon riders make their own rules.But a determination to survive won’t be enough this year.Because Violet knows the real secret hidden for centuries at Basgiath War College—and nothing, not even dragon fire, may be enough to save them in the end.","[{'rating': 3, 'content': '3 ⭐️ The ending . . .

No matter how hard I try, I cannot get this book out of my head, all because of those last 25 pages . . . \u2060How dare Rebecca do this to us, knowing we have to wait god knows how long for book 3. 😭\u2060Did I enjoy it?Yes.\u2060Was it better than Fourth Wing?No.\u2060But will I continue the series?Abso-f*cking-lutely!\u2060This book is really hard for me to rate because while I enjoyed the story and the ending, there were a lot of technical (plot/character) issues that definitely hindered my overall enjoyment.*SPOILERS AHEAD*\u2060What I liked:\u2060The story is action-packed from start to finish, so you\'ll never want to put this book down.Iron Flame is divided into two parts. Part one takes place at Basgiath War College and part two focuses on the Revolution. There\'s 623 pages total, and I genuinely felt like I read two books because so much happens. I\'m glad I took detailed notes because I\'ve already forgotten a lot and I know I\'ll need to refer to them before starting book 3.The continued world-building is fascinating.Like I said, this story is non-stop and that includes uncovering new information about the history and politics of this world. We now have a solid idea on what\'s really happening on the continent, however, there\'s still so many unanswered questions about the past (before the unification), the venin, and the Empyrean. I love this phase of a long series because there\'s still so much we don\'t know or understand, and I can\'t wait to see everything unfold and come together in the next few books. \u2060These characters are some of my favorites and need to be protected at all costs.Violet is still a badass. Xaden is still daddy. Tairn is fucking hilarious. And Andarna is the sassiest bitch in the realm. I do wish she wasn\'t away for half the story though.Violet internally struggled a lot more in this book by bottling up her emotions, distancing herself from her friends, and taking on too much responsibility (like researching the wards).Violet is just as strong and determined as she was in Fourth Wing, but in Iron Flame, we see the toll everything takes on her. I\'m glad that by part two she starts to lean on her friends more, but I\'m worried how she\'s going to manage after the events at the end of book 2. There\'s only so much a person can take, and I fear Violet may break at some point in the future. I\'m looking forward to seeing how her character develops in the rest of the series.PS: Violet during the torture scenes and and final battle when she saves Sawyer was impressive as hell! I respect her so much and strive to be just as badass.Xaden is still top tier book boyfriend material.Look, he is not perfect. In fact, I\'m a little pissed at him for constantly putting the responsibility of sharing truths on Violet throughout this story when he could have easily been open and forthcoming. BUT I DON\'T CARE. That man is just so damn confident, intelligent, sexy and loyal to Violet, that the minute he\'s on the page, I lose my damn mind. And when he writes letters to Violet . . . I melted. He isn\'t even a romantic guy, but did one of the most romantic things in the world.There\'s also a lot of side characters (both old and new) that I enjoyed getting to know better:Rhi, Ridoc, Imogen, Bodhi, Mira, Brennan, Sawyer, Jesinia, Sloane, and Maren. There\'s also a bunch of characters I loathe and wanted to see die a slow and painful death. Some don\'t. Some do. *cough* Varrish *cough*. Fuck that guy. But I can\'t complain, because everyone likes a good villain and Iron Flame definitely had a few!PS: I don\'t hate Dain anymore.Obviously, what he did was absolutely horrible and I don\'t think I can ever truly forgive him for the role he played in Liam\'s death. BUT we have to remember, he didn\'t know what was going to happen and seems to be very repentant for it all. Do I trust him? Hell no. But do I think he\'s a bad guy? No. I still think he needs to redeem himself, so I\'ll be curious to see where his character goes from here.Those few chapters with imaginary Liam were everything.😭 Liam\'s death absolutely broke me and still haunts me to this day. So seeing him again, in the way that we did, gave me some closure. But this entire situation has me wondering (THEORY AHEAD), what if Violet\'s second signent is her talking to the dead?! We know a lot of history has been lost or written out of existence, so I\'m wondering if the only way Violet can find answers is through some power of communicating with the dead?RIP Mama Sorrengail.For all of Fourth Wing and most of Iron Flame, I hated her. And honestly, even after everything, I still don\'t like her very much. However, while I know she wasn\'t a great person or mom, I understand her choices. Again, I don\'t agree with them, but she really thought she was protecting her children. I wept when she died, not because I am sad she\'s dead, but for Brennan, Mira, and Violet. They now know that even if their mom was misguided, her intention was driven by the love of her children and now that she\'s gone, they\'ll mourn what was and what could have been. They each had such different responses and I felt them all.The ending . . .I mean, I\'ve already talked enough about it but DAMN, I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING. I predicted General Sorrengail would die but I thought maybe Violet would get taken by the Sage or something. So yeah, I am still completely shocked by that ending, maybe even a little pissed, and will be sending Rebecca Yarros my next therapy bill.What I didn\'t like:This is a small gripe, but why are they using the Julian Calendar in this fantasy world?I mean, Rebecca created a completely new world but couldn\'t come up with different names for the months of the year? Every time it mentioned December or July, it totally took me out of the story.\u2060The pacing was frantic and for what?So much happens, yet, at the same time, I didn\'t feel like a lot happened to push the overarching plot forward. The highlights are: Violet goes back to school, Violet tries to learn about wards, Violet gets tortured, Violet and half the college goes back to revolution headquarters, Xaden and Violet get the luminary, and then the final battle happens. We didn\'t need 600+ pages just to give us that. @listenwithbritt mentioned in an IG reel that the pacing felt like she was watching a TV series, and I totally agree. Every few chapters felt like a TV episode with some small task that needed to be accomplished or there was a hurdle to overcome; then it would get quickly resolved and they\'d move onto the next thing. There were a lot of small subplots that were unimportant and felt like filler scenes. So the constant bombardment of action, angst, or mystery was a bit overwhelming and it was hard to decipher at the time what scenes were really important for the overall story. For example, what real value did the survival class or the death hike scenes offer? In my opinion, not much but creating small moments of conflict to keep the story moving along. Maybe Rebecca wrote Iron Flame this way since the series is getting turned into a TV series by Amazon.The story was too dense.There were too many new names, history, and general knowledge to really keep track of what was important. And there were quite a few things that weren\'t fully explained or were overlooked. Pair that with the frantic pacing, and there wasn\'t enough time to fully digest all this new information before we were forced to move on to the next part of the story. I had to read slowly, re-read sections, and take notes to keep track of everything. Doing that for 16 hours was a bit overwhelming and exhausting.I HATED the other woman (OW) drama.It’s a tacky, cheap, and overdone romance conflict and totally unnecessary. There was also a big inconsistency surrounding it. First off, Bodhi mentions Cat early on by saying how Xaden has never cared so much about anyone, not even Cat, which alluded that at some point Xaden was involved with and potentially cared deeply for another woman. But later, Xaden says Cat could die for all he cares and he has never loved her. So why was Violet lead to believe he had feelings for another woman at some point? Solely to create drama between Xaden and Violet. And why didn’t Violet ask Xaden about Cat the minute she found out about her? If she did this, she wouldn’t have been blindsided by it all CHAPTERS LATER when they went to get the luminary from Cat’s family.Also, Xaden should have been transparent about Cat when it first came up so Violet didn\'t spend chapters feeling insecure. And the way Cat was a nasty bitch to Violet the entire book, but then randomly decides she\'s cool with her after Violet saves her life was so anticlimactic. This was probably the weakest sub-plot of the entire book. And if there\'s more OW or OM drama in the rest of the series, I will fucking riot. Xaden better not use Cat to drive Violet away in the next book.I was underwhelmed by the romance.Honestly, their relationship was stagnant because they didn\'t have enough time together in this book. With Xaden being away for most of the first part and then they end up doing their own things for the Revolution during the second part, there was little time for them to really grow deeper as a couple.I also expected more groveling by Xaden at the beginning, but instead he makes Violet responsible for his honesty by saying she has to be the one to ask questions and then he\'ll answer. But for the entire book, Violet doesn\'t ask him anything! So, she doesn\'t get any answers! Meanwhile, Xaden just sits around, not communicating with Violet, when he could easily take the initiative to share his truths. Their lack of communication was so frustrating and was definitely done to create drama for the story. It was dumb and lazy writing. They could have easily set aside time to really hash out the issues of their relationship and dive deep into the secrets Xaden is keeping, but they don\'t.The smut also didn\'t hit this time.For the size of this book and the fact Xaden and Violet are an already established relationship, I expected at least five sex scenes, but we got three. Okay, I\'ll admit, the throne scene was hot but only because of the setting. I wasn\'t excited by the dirty talk and, yeah, the smut was just lackluster in my opinion. It wasn\'t bad, just forgettable.It didn\'t feel like any character had enough time to go through any real development.I think this occurred because there were so many new characters introduced that the attention of the story was split. Or maybe it\'s also because the story is in Violet\'s POV and she pulled away from everyone, so since she wasn\'t as ingrained in their lives, she didn\'t notice changes/growth? I don\'t know, but I wish we could have had more time with Xaden, Rhi, and Sloane.There were a few things that didn\'t really get explained.For example, why wouldn\'t Brennan encourage Violet to do research on wards? Violet was trained as a Scribe and would be an excellent person to assign for this task. I get he didn\'t think they would have enough time to figure it out and he thought they should focus on making more weapons, but no one assigned Violet a mission, so why have her do nothing instead of possibly finding a solution to win the war? His logic wasn\'t full-proof. Also, the end where Brennan fixes the wardstone. . . we spent the entire book trying to understand wards and then figure out how to mend them and somehow Brennan does this but we don\'t see how? It better be explained in the next book and not glossed over. Also, why did Xaden become venin? In the dream he has, the Sage said it would save Violet from dying while she was draining herself for the wardstone, but I don\'t see how thats true. If you have any ideas please let me know. And random but can someone please make a timeline of when Xaden would have been able to have a relationship with Cat? Because according to my math, he would have been, like, 14 years old! There are even more situations that needed an explanation but I don\'t have the energy to go through them all.Overall, Iron Flame was a decent sequel. I enjoyed it. I was entertained. But it was messy, and left me wanting more and less at the same time. It should have been shorter, the plot should have been cleaned up a bit, and we should have spent more time with our favorite characters instead of being introduced to a shit ton of new characters (whom I\'m still not sure are important). It really is entertaining though, so if you enjoyed Fourth Wing, you\'ll probably enjoy this one, or at the very least, be able to push through it.

I didn’t see that coming and while it wasn’t Zodiac Academy cliffhanger level of bad, cuz let’s be real nothing will be as horrific as Shadow Princess or Heartless Sky cliffhanger 💀\xa0Iron Flame ending had me spiralling.. how tf will this issue be resolvedIFit can even be resolved I’M NOT OKAY 😭😭😭Fourth Wing was so action packed and fast paced with lots of “OMG”-moments like when Violet bonded not one but two dragons, finding out the dragon’s power, certain sacrifices etc. So compared to the first book Iron Flame is much slower plotwise. It starts where Fourth Wing left off and continues with Violet and co. going back to Basgiath College for their second year and act like mentors for the new first year students.🗡️VIOLET SORRENGAIL(h) 🗡️”Violence, remember it’s only the body that’s fragile. You are unbreakable.”I love Violet so much, but I think she struggled a lot in this book with her position in this world and what her purpose is. Violet has the best intentions at heart, but feels like she is failing everyone and I just wanted to give her a hug this whole book 😭\xa0when she said that she never failed anything in her life but now she keeps failing and making the wrong decisions I felt for her!!But Vi’s struggle were actually the part that made me love her more. Yes, she did make some questionable decisions in this book, but that’s what makes her character so realistic for me. She tries her best and sometimes her best isn’t enough, but this girlnevergives up. She will keep standing up no matter how many times she gets kicked down. She will find the solution to the problem no matter how many hours she will need to research, but she will do the work.That scene with her Varrish and Nolan and a certain other character whose name I can’t name killed me 😭\xa0it was so painful to read.. Violet was so strong for enduring everything and not losing her mind completely.. I would have folded so quickly 🌚\xa0Violet Sorrengail best girl. There is a reason she bonded not one, but two dragons. 💅🔹XANDEN RIORSON(H) 🔹“Violet.” His gaze rakes over my face, lingering on my cheeks. I love the way he says my name. Sure, it’s the alcohol overruling my logic, but I want to hear him say it again. “Lieutenant Riorson.”LIEUTENANT RIORSON Y’ALL. If you think WINGLEADER Xaden was hot wait til you get Xaden as a lieutenant that just hits differently 🛐\xa0He was so hot in this book.Xaden has still so many secrets we don’t know about and I think there is still so much to his story. Like where did his mother disappear? I’m still so intrigued by his character and now even more after that ending… I didn’t see that coming and I’m still shocked. I wish we would get more Xaden POVs in the books because the one at the end is never enough… with that ending I hope that Xaden will be more of a focus in the next book, cause I just want to know more about him.🐉TAIRN & ANDARNA (DRAGONS)🐉“A rolling dismount would tear you limb from limb on impact,” he retorts.“You don’t know that,” Andarna counters with what seems to be her new default form of conversation—telling Tairn he’s wrong. A growl rumbles through Tairn’s chest, vibrating the saddle beneath me and the harness that holds Andarna to his chest.“I’d watch it,” I tell her, biting back a smile. “He might get tired and drop you.”“His pride would never allow it.”“Says the dragon who spent twenty minutes refusing to put on her harness,” Tairn fires back.It would be a huge lie if I’d say I haven’t missed my sunshine princess Andarna in this book, because I did, but eventually all babies have to grow up and Andarna became a teenager 🥺\xa0her angsty teenager attitude towards Tairn had me laughing my ass off. I love their relationship so much and they are the best father-daughter duo. Their bond is so precious! When Andarna said she wanted to be just like Tairn, because he is loyal, fierce and strong it made me so emotional 😭😭\xa0And to my grumpy, firerce, strong and loyal dragon Tairn.. I can only say that I thought I couldn’t love him more after Fourth Wing, but I do now. The way Tairn protects Violet and stands by her side is everything. The relationship that the dragons have with their riders is *chef’s kiss*🧚THE ROMANCE🧚I meant what I said on the parapet. Even when I’m not with you, there’s only youMy violetxaden heart was so happy!! I mean I knew Violet would be really stubborn about the Xaden lying to her thing and would hold it against him for quite some time, but I loved the angst that created. But Xaden is completely smitten with her and we love to see an obsessed boy. Vi doesn’t think that he would choose her over the revolution, but she doesn’t realized that Xaden would burn down the world for her 😌\xa0he is not like that rule-following loser Dain .. Xaden would break every rule for her and the way Xaden is so worried for Vi and wants to protect her has my heart melting into a puddle 🥰Also can we talk about Xaden writing Violet letters while he is away?? that is so romantic and had me going 🥺\xa0I only wished we could have read more of his letters and not only small excerps. Don’t be shy Rebecca give us the full content.👫SIDE CHARACTERS👫Rhiannon:my queen i love you, it took me forever to remember you name, but now you better survive until the end or i will personally hunt Rebecca til the end of the worldRidoc:my comedic king i love youImogen: i love you my other kickass queenDain:fuck you, i haven’t forgiven you and i don’t think i willJesinia:what a cutie, i like her and she better stays loyal to Violet and doesn’t betray herCat:FUCK YOU, but in capital letters.Varrish:oh i hope someone fucks you with a 10 inch pole i fucking hate you. that c*nt… why does every magical school has a Professor Umbridge character that is so detestable. This man will answer for all his sins and the atrocities he commited against Violet. I hope this loser never finds a moment of peace.to the rest of the side characters: you were either irrelevant, i couldn’t remember you’re names or i refuse to remember to name, cause you going to die either way in this book or later.👯\u200d♀️VIOLET & MIRA & BRENNAN👯\u200d♀️the scene where Mira finds out that Brennan is alive and punches him in the face lives in my mind rent free. That’s my girl lmao cause I would react the same way if I’d find out one of my sibling pretended to be death for the last six years. I’D BE LIVID.But it was great to see all Sorrengail siblings back together. I love seeing them all together and get a glimpse of their different dynamics with each other. When Mira and Brennan were fighting and Violet was just standing next to them and felt like their little sister again dksdskd 😭\xa0I love them and they are all badasses in their own way.🔻WHY IRON FLAME WAS WEAKER THAN FOURTH WING IMO🔻↠ if Fourth Wing was Catching Fire (The Hunger Games) then I’d say that Iron Flame is Mockingjay in terms of action and pace. As I mentioned abovethis book is much more slower paced. It’s one of those books where a lot happens, but at the same time nothing at all, because they are trying to establish the rebellion, gather their tropes, find out more information how to raise the wards etc. So it deals with the characters getting to class and learning about magic etc. While a lot of people still die in this book, Iron Flame just didn’t feel as high staked imo as Fourth Wing did. Violet and her friends survived all the trials and first year, so I didn’t feel like I was constantly on the edge of my seat not knowing what will happen next. Don’t get me wrong there were many scenes that HAD ME STRESSED OUT and sweating, because it was intense, but it wasn’t intense as a whole as Fourth Wing and didn’t me give me as much nostalgia as Fourth Wing did.↠ theinfo-dumpingwas a bit much in this book. I think Fourth Wing had the perfect amount of world building and information. Iron Flame had a lot of information because the characters are going to class and learn about new magic and trying to gather info on how to raise wards and power the wardstone etc. and I get that it was important, but seeing them look for information, just to try it and fail and then having to continue their search was a bit exhausting.↠ some of the themes in this book were repetitive. Since Violet and Xaden couldn’t see each other a lot in the first half of the book I ate up every scenes they had together, but the things they were fighting over were always the same.. Violet not being able to trust him, them not being able to proper communicate with each other, Violet complaining about Xaden lying and having too many secrets .. that was pretty much the root of every single fight they had. Their push and pull was a bit tiring to read at the beginning cause they had the same argument over and over again.CONCLUSIONFourth Wing was a perfect book for me and a 10 outta 10 so even though Iron Flame didn’t reach that level for me and had quite some flaws, it was still an enjoyable book to read and I love love love this world so much with the dragon and magic and harry potter vibes. I love this series and after that brutal ending I need the next book in my hands right now. Praying that we don’t have to wait a whole year for the next book to come out.P.S: What is the author going to write in the next THREE books?! We are already in the middle of fighting against the venin and wyvern and I hope RY doesn’t drag out the storyline too much and makes it another Zodiac Academy situation 💀┍━━━━━━━━»•» «•«━┑THE EMPYREAN SERIES#1 Fourth Wing –\xa05 stars#2Iron Flame–\xa04 stars┕━»•» «•«━━━━━━━━┙'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '0/5 ⭐️ you thought Fourth Wing was bad…? Oh you sweet summer child.Goodreads has been real finicky about reviews recently so I will only be speaking on the book and its content (not the author though I have very many opinions (none of them kind☺️))also there are spoilers in this review but who cares because you shouldn’t be reading this book to begin with! (Don’t let my sacrifice be in vain)I intended to get this review out way sooner but unfortunately (and unsurprisingly) this book was actually so much worse than Fourth Wing!🥳I naively assumed Fourth Wing would be the top contender for worst book of the year but Iron Flame made me wish I was reading Fourth Wing!!At least Fourth Wing had the decency to be short enough to get through in a week, Iron Flame takes every flaw of Fourth Wing and not only makes it worse but makes it LONGER(???!?!) while somehow simultaneously being even more boring! Wow!🤩 Good job Yarros!!! What a fantasy icon!!🧝🏻\u200d♀️Remember how Fourth Wing had one of the most idiotic, and juvenile writing styles in any adult fantasy book ever? Imagine that but now in a world where editing was never invented!! 🥰The sentence structure was legitimately horrendous. I actually wish I was kidding.If you have the unfortunate displeasure of being in a twenty mile radius of a copy of Iron Flame and are unlucky enough to stroll past it in the store or your local library, I beg you, after you recover from the sheer horror of being in the same room as such an abomination to fantasy, open it to a random page and just ATTEMPT to read a paragraph out loud.I am a creative writing major, I read books out loud all the time. I have never struggled so much with a book in my entire life. Sincerely whoever had to do the audio book must have the endurance and the mental fortitude of a saint.Forgive me, Yarros, for believing reading should be an enjoyable experience, clearly you do not agree. 🧎\u200d♀️Also Yarros used 493 ellipses and 1089 em-dashes on my count! The book is about 634 pages!💫And oh! A Drinking game🥂: take a shot every time a character’s eyebrow or brow or brows are mentioned!! Actually don’t! You’d definitely die! Brows are mentioned over a hundred times!!🫠 I have to laugh (or else I might scream) at the idea that THIS is accessible fantasy because not only is the plot and the world building convoluted and unengaging but the writing is so incredibly shit that it makes you reread half of the sentences over again if you want to the vaguest inkling of an idea of what is going on in this horseshit world. To call Iron Flame accessible spits in the face of twenty plus years of hard work and effort by truly talented authors to make fantasy books that are actually welcoming and accessible to a wide audience.Let’s actually talk about the plot. Fourth Wing was derivative and predictable and Iron Flame doesn’t even try to be any more.Here’s a list of some 🌈✨creative😍 plot points Yarros used:- A shitty copycat version of the Hunger Game’s rebellion (with zero of the interesting nuance or intelligent discourse)😯- what is essentially a boring Umbridge at a half-assed attempt to create tension😧- The Rider Quadrant and the Infantry Quadrant finally interact!! They are dropped in the middle of a forest, are being hunted by dragons, and are given two maps and told to go to a location marked on the maps! A simple assignment for students at a war school who surely know how to navigate using a map because that’s an important skill for soldiers to know, right?! 🗺️ Not only do these riders not learn how to read a map until year two (WHY?) but apparently the Infantry and Riders hate each other so much😠 that THEY DON’T EVEN COMPARE THE TWO MAPS WHEN PEOPLE HAVE CONFLICTING IDEAS ABOUT WHERE THEY ARE. THEY WALK AROUND IN A FOREST FOR HOURS INSTEAD OF COLLABORATING ONCE. I don’t care how much you hate someone at school, if you are given a group assignment literally step one is compare all documents you have been given so you can be done as quickly as possible. ALSO WHEN ONE OF THE INFANTRY ASKS TO WHAT TO SO IN THE EVEN OF A DRAGON ATTACK THE RIDERS LAUGH AND MAKE FUN OF THEM FOR BEING SCARED??? THEN WHEN A DRAGON ATTACKS THE RIDERS ARE MAD AT THE INFANTRY FOR DOING THE WRONG THING AFTER THEY LITERALLY WERE NOT TOLD WHAT TO DO!! Yarros when I find you Yarros Yarros when I find you Yarros🏃\u200d♀️🏃\u200d♀️- Jack Barlow back because I guess Yarros couldn’t come up with another new antagonist… also he’s Venin for reasons. Really it’s not that interesting. The resurrection trope is so fun!!🤩🤗- A torture scene summary that is not scary in the slightest because this book conditions you to know that Violet is never in any real danger despite trying to tell you she is always on the verge of death 😱- A visit to what is essentially the Summer Court in search the Book of some bullshit thing called a luminary (btw we don’t even know what it looks like until 60% through the book AFTER they’ve acquired it???)🤫- a catty ex-girlfriend (named Cat, wow ✨creative✨) making a reappearance and doing nothing but promotes wonderful stereotypes (even though Yarros tries really hard to tell you it doesn’t on page the literal page)💃🏻- and the most anticlimactic and boring battle with the dumbest ending I’ve ever read!! 🤺There are more stupid plot points, but I’m getting brain damage trying to remember the plot of this book so I’m just going to talk about things that made me wish I was attempting to consume whole boulders rather than read the most accessible fantasy book of all time: Iron Flame by Rebecca Yarros😇Varrish. He’s our Umbridge lookalike. He strolls into the Dragon Rider Academy and he’s super scary with his one-eyed dragon Solas!!! 😰I mean he would have been, but literally the first time he does anything scary by letting his dragon incinerate an entire squad, TAIRN FLYS IN AND THREATENS SOLAS. AND SOLAS AND VARRISH BOTH COWER BECAUSE TAIRN IS SO BIG AND SUPER SCARY AND THE 🌈✨⭐️MoST PoWErFuL⭐️✨🌈 DraGOn😀Well maybe this is understandable because Solas just killed like twenty people, right?🤔 But no! Tairn isn’t mad about that, he’s mad because Violet got like a first degree burn.I don’t know what Yarros was attempting to achieve with this scene but you know what it does achieve? It tells the reader that Varrish isn’t actually a scary villain because having Tairn put him in his place the moment he does a single villainous action. IT DESTROYS ALL TENSION YOU COULD HAVE HAD.🧍🏻\u200d♀️And don’t you worry, dearest reader, this is a trend. LATER TAIRN MAKES VARRISH GET ON HIS KNEES AND APOLOGIZE TO VIOLET FOR BEING MEAN TO HER. ⁉️⁉️IN FACT ANYTIME ANYONE IS MEAN TO VIOLET THE ENTIRE WORLD COMES TO HER DEFENSE. Any character, any dragon, I swear to god a speck of dust could land on Violet wrong and the entire cast of characters would jump them. And it’s not just her friends. THE SIDE CHARACTERS, MAIN CHARACTERS, CHARACTERS WITH LITERALLY A SINGLE LINE OF DIALOGUE, MINOR AND MAIN ANTAGONISTS.THEY ALL COMPLIMENT VIOLETC O N S T A N T L Y.VARRISH COMPLIMENTS HER, THE VENIN COMPLIMENT HER, CAT COMPLIMENTS HER.Sloane (the sister of Liam, the stupid dead guy👱🏻\u200d♂️ that Violet tries to convince us was her friend) says the most benign of comments against Violet and Rhiannon and every other personality-devoid lampshade of a character in a seven mile vicinity practically threatens to jump this GRIEVING 20 year old girl.Characters that Violet doesn’t even know will compliment her out of the blue.THE BOOK READS LIKE AN INSECURE PERSON WISH FUFILLMENT. 💇\u200d♀️It’s so unbelievably unbearable. 👹The Violet Defense Squad™️ is literally in every chapter. My favorite part about this book was that I couldn’t find a chapter where Violet isn’t complimented for doing literally nothing in any of all 66 chapters of the entire book.🤭🤩And in case you were concerned that anyone who was mean to Violet would get interesting character development, nope! They either end up dead or want to be her friend by the end🥰 awesome!😎 Violet is my favorite character😍Are you interested in Violet’s character arc? Well let me tell you the wonderful highs of this perfect character that we’re supposed to root for and support!!😘Violet starts out strong by making insane demands of Xaden like demanding he tell her literally everything even though she had her mind read last book! And she doesn’t just mention this once. She mentions this every single time we see Xaden. She doesn’t trust him, she tells us, but she loves him, she tells us. 🙄 They’re such a cute and believable and interesting couple 🥰🥰 and their dynamic is made so much better by that random ex-girlfriend that was included because Yarros got bored I guess!😍On top of being annoying and insecure, Violet decided that this book she would also double down on being one the worst people imaginable! Remember when all those people Violet considered friends died in her first year and she was so sad about that?Well actually this book Violet tells us that she’s gained some new perspective!!🤯Actually she’s glad all those people died because watching all those people die made her a better rider because they inspired her to… not die(?)! Because that’s a normal and morally good thing for our main character that is SO empathetic and SO kind to say!🙈 Violet is so good, I wish I was just like her!!!☺️Also remember Sloane and her dead brother?!👱🏻\u200d♂️ Well Liam spent all of book one writing letters to Sloane, his only living family! Wouldn’t it be so nice if Violet gave those to Sloane out of the kindness and goodness of her heart to help Sloane cope with the loss of her older brother?!😊 Well she didn’t!!Violet withheld the letters for weeks after Sloane arrived at the school, (weeks in which Sloane very well could have died by the way) and only offered to give Sloane the letters if she agreed to train with Imogen (a girl Sloane does not like) and only agreed to give her one letter a week!! There are over fifty letters Violet! What happens if Sloane dies during a freak accident which you KNOW are rampant at this death school???! Violet is such an empath guys🥺 she really understands and cares for the people around her.😣 Don’t you wish you were just like her?!😁Violet also does a variety of things such as:- Dropping a gryphon flier off the side of a cliff and then being surprised when said gryphon flier’s friends don’t like her? Inspirational💫- Talking shit on the infantry for not trusting dragons and being cowards after literally being a prime example as to why the infantry should not trust riders or their dragons! So empathetic🥺- Wanting to murder Xaden’s ex for saying a couple of barely mean comments to her! A totally rational response!!!👍- Trying to translate a journal from a dead language she doesn’t know (she does know many other dead languages, of course) instead of giving it to the girl that she’s knows understands that dead language! Wow! the smartest main character of our generation! 🤯- Accusing every scholar and student of the school of perpetuating misinformation and hiding history that she herself just found out about! She’s so kind and thoughtful 🥳- Forgetting instantly about her friend who got her neck snapped after some assassin asked who Violet Sorrengail was. She cares so much about her friends!👯\u200d♀️- And many, many more abhorrent things🤩In case you forgot (because apparently Yarros did 90% of the book) Violet has EDS. Sometimes it’s brought up, but not really with any substance. And Violet just wraps her joints and “pushes through it” and “puts all her pain into a box” (??) and pretends she doesn’t have a problem at all. No further accommodations are granted to her in this book aside from the saddle from last book which is already dumb because everyone trying to hold onto a flying creature should be using saddles anyway.I highly suggest: Fly Or Die: The Ableist Narrative of Toxic Perseverance by Ella T Holmes for a much better explanation than I can provide as someone that doesn’t have EDS.Let’s talk about Xaden because if I have to think about how super special and powerful and amazing Violet is I might eat all the gravel in my backyard. Xaden’s depiction in this book is gross to say the least.Rebecca has confirmed that he’s a PoC which is great!Keeping that in mind, I love how he’s described as incapable of love and is called a monster and is untrustworthy!!😍😍And I absolutely adore that our super special and talented basic white girl Violet is the person that shows him true love and trust and is the only person who can take his mask of cruelty and violence off for the first time even though she’s so much smaller and weaker than big, strong, powerful Xaden. It’s so cool that all the other characters are so terrified of him and that he acts as little more than Violet’s big overprotective and jealous guard dog! I especially love that Violet’s mom practically tortured him and gave him a hundred and something scars and that he has to take responsibility for all of the marked ones!! That’s not concerning and horrific!!!! And I love that he also got another scar for “claiming” Violet!! that’s so attractive and romantic and good representation and not at all fetishizing men of color at all!!!🥰🥰🥰 Thank you so much for your hard work Yarros!!!🫡He’s also annoying and refuses to tell Violet anything unless she asks hyper specific questions. Their whole dynamic is just annoying and stupid.And I love all of Yarros’ other characters who have less personality than paper bags with faces drawn on them!!🪑 Frankly a folding chair has more charm than any of the characters in this book.They’re so unique and are definitely really funny and don’t ever bog down the scenes with so many characters that you can’t tell who is even talking anymore! They’re all unique and dynamic with character arcs!! Of course! What else would they be?😆And the dragons! 🐉 Oh the dragons! How could I forget about the dragons that are nothing but glorified Uber rides!! They don’t do shit but posture and growl and be boring!Here’s some fun facts about dragons: dragons can choose their tail shape but they can’t choose their color which directly influences their personality and temperament!!All baby dragons are gold because that’s interesting! Is there an evolutionary reason for that or something? Not that we’re told of!More dragon sex is mentioned, thankfully we don’t have to live through the dragon-lust again though!Also the dismounts that Rebecca describes the Riders doing are literally physically impossible!! All the riders should be dead if they try to pull that shit! Giant flying dragons are not horses you can’t just walk around on it while it’s diving and jump off of it😭😭Oh and Anadarna also is now like a super special purple/chameleon never before seen breed of dragon with the rarest tail shape!🐲 Are we surprised? No. Just bored. 😴She also now has like a disabled/malformed wing. Her wings were fine in the first book, but now they’re not? Idk. I feel like that should have been a thing in book one but whatever. (Tairn literally blames it on Violet which is sort of hilariously fucked up??) But anyway she obviously can still fly because god forbid a disability ever hinder a character in anyway that makes them adapt, but she can’t ever hold a rider? Violet is like 90 pounds as we are so graciously reminded so I feel like if Andarna gets bigger she definitely should be able to carry her but whatever. 🤷\u200d♀️TLDR: the dragons are BORING. And they’re not even funny or cool or even scary. Why write about dragons if you make them boring and insignificant to the plot??! And Andarna is a special-special because of course she is. 🤪This review is getting way too long so let’s just talk about the ending.Oh no! Violet’s mom that got no real development or anything died! Anyway. 🧐Why the fuck did the revolution refuse to help Navarre? They claim to be morally superior and to care about the lives of civilians but just blatantly ignore like 50% of the continent’s population because they’re Navarre citizens? And we’re supposed to root for them? Right! Awesome! Okay!😆👍What are the actual morals of the revolution? What is their end goal? Why did Violet join them so quickly without asking any questions??🫠She’s so intelligent!🤓I’m completely fine with Xaden becoming Venin, though I doubt it will be resolved in an interesting way. Though I don’t think it’s really an interesting plot twist and I saw it coming a mile away after all the boring Venin info dumping I had to sit through, but at least it’s something.HOWEVER I CANNOT FORGIVE IT FOR MAKING THE FINAL LINES OF THE BOOK“Welcome to our fucked-up family. Guess we’re brothers now.”THE SECOND TO LAST LINE IN THE BOOK IS “WELCOME TO OUR FUCKED UP FAMILY”😭😭😭😭😭WHAT WHAT WHATDO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT DID TO ME??I READ 634 PAGES OF THE WORST, MEANDERING, BULLSHIT PLOT POINTS, HORRIFIC AND BORING SEX SCENES, INDECIPHERABLE INFO DUMPS, NONSENSICAL MAGIC SYSTEMS, FLAT CHARACTERS, BORING DRAGONS, HORRIBLE REPRESENTATION, AGGRESSIVELY UNFUNNY FRAT BOY HUMOR, UNEDITED GARBAGE AND YOU END IT WITH “WELCOME TO OUR FUCKED UP FAMILY”???????????????!!!!!!!!!!!?!?!?!!?!??!ARE YOU TRYING TO GIVE ME A JOKER ARC??? WAS THAT THE POINT OF THIS BOOK????AM I SUPPOSED TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY AS AN ACTUAL FANTASY BOOK???THE REASON THIS BOOK TOOK ME SO LONG TO REVIEW IS BECAUSE I GOT ACTUAL PSYCHIC DAMAGE FROM THE LAST LINES OF THIS BOOK.I HYPERVENTILATED I THREW MY PHONE I SCREAMED I STARED AT A WALL AND CONTEMPLATED MY PLACE AND PURPOSE ON THIS EARTHI HAD MORE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT THAN ANY CHARACTER IN THIS ENTIRE BOOK IN THE 0.5 SECONDS AFTER READING THOSE LINESHOW AM I SUPPOSED TO REACT TO THAT??DID YARROS THINK SHE ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING WITH THAT ENDING??HAVE I LOST MY MIND?? PEOPLE LIKE THIS BOOK? PEOPLE TAKE IT SERIOUSLY AND MAKE UP THEORIES FOR IT??? WHAT??????GENUINELY IF YOU LIKE THIS BOOK WHY? WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? ARE YOU OKAY? DO YOU NEED HELP?WELCOME TO OUR FUCKED UP FAMILY??? GUESS WE’RE BROTHERS NOW???YARROS I AM LIVING IN YOUR WALLS WHAT DO YOU MEAN WELCOME TO OUR FUCKED UP FAMILY WHAT DO YOU MEAN😭😭😭😭😭😭I FEEL LIKE I AM ENTITLED TO FINANCIAL COMPENSATION FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL DAMAGE THIS BOOK HAS INFLICTED UPON MEso thanks for reading my review <3 I hope this helps your decision making process when it comes to buying books :) (don’t buy this book) Yarros did not receive any financial compensation for my suffering and I highly recommend that if you want to read this book (for some reason??? Why?? I spent so long writing this to give you reasons not to!😭) you get it from your library or literally any other means.Red Tower and Yarros are not people that deserve your hard earned money or support.Also whoever the fuck claimed to have edited this book is a world class scammer because they got paid for doing literally nothing. But also they should be fired and exiled and never allowed to look at words again.I have more to say but I hit the word limit💀'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Because love, at its root, is hope. Hope for tomorrow. Hope for what could be. Hope that someone you've entrusted your everything to will cradle and protect it. And hope? That shit is harder to kill than a dragon.Well, fuck🥲That being said, I promised myself I'd finish my current readings before starting this one, but FoMo was a bitch and then, would you believe that, I tripped and fell into Xadaddy's arms.Silly, clumsy me.Iron Flame was alright, but I'm not crazy about it.I found the writing even more YAish than it was in Fourth Wing and I, painfully, have to admit I feel the same about the romance.I don't know if maybe, when I first read Fourth Wing, I was in a place, mentally speaking, where my reader needs were more than met despite the flaws, but it seems like I can't overlook them with the sequel.Being completely honest, the plot does pick up after the first half and the romance has its up and downs all through the story, but it never reaches the point where I felt like giving up on it completely.The smut was fine and the tension well written, but I'm not a fan of Yarros's idea of spicy dialogues.The one liners, sometimes, made me cringe a little, and the characterization of the main characters left me a tad confused, at times, especially at the beginning. I couldn't follow the story properly because I felt like Violet was thinking one thing then acting in a completely opposite way.Speaking of Violet...When I read FW, I thought Yarros'd made her a bit of a Mary Sue, but that was okay, because she had obvious flaws, even she was aware of, to balance her randomly having every special skill on the menu and succeding in every single task she was burdened with.Iron Flame Violet is a total badass and she's definitely grown a lot, but she also feels a little incomplete and rough at the edges. I don't know if it's intentional and/or tied to her future evolution, but I wouldn't have minded her being more confident, especially when it comes to her relationship with Xaden.Xaden is still daddy, in case you're asking, and he was a total dreamboat, the ultimate book boyfriend from start to finish.Like I've mentioned before, I wasn't really sure about the romance, at first. I wanted more grovelling and Violet's constant thirsting over Xaden's fine behind gave me a headache. It gave me major early Tory/Darius vibes, and if you're a fan of Zodiac Academy, you'll get what I mean.Thankfully, things took a pleasant turn when I reached the second part and I wasn't only rooting for them, I was absolutely feral when everything mined their eventual happiness.This works for the plot as well. In the first half, I wasn't really enjoying myself and could count on one hand the moments I actually found interesting.But then shit hit the fan, twists started piling up and every page turned was an angsty fest I totally wanted to attend. I devoured the second half in hours and when I reached the end, just felt like staring at the wall.And have a mojito or two.I definitely didn't see THAT coming.Another thing I really appreciated, aside from the chef's kiss perfect action scenes and THE SASSY DRAGONS (omg my baby Andarna!!!), were the secondary characers. Violet and Xaden's friends deserve their own books - Rhi in particular <3<3<3< - and I definitely hope the sequels will focus on them more, especially because some characters are only now starting to blossom and they seem particularly interesting.I also would like to take advantage of this topic to admit I never really hated Dain. I'm pretty passive when it comes to him, but I swear to god, if RY takesthatdirection, I'm gonna throw a fit.Overall, this was, for me, a decent sequel, albeit an unnecessarily long one.If you loved FW but are having trouble with it like I did, I recommend pushing through it.All in all, it's pretty worth it.I'll leave under the spoiler tag some sort of disclaimer because, even though I usually try my best to stay clear of any kind of drama and hate brining real life politics into my bookish heaven, I've been harassed for a couple days both in public and in private because of my choice to give this book a chance, so for the first and last time in my permanence here on this site, I'll go out of my usual way and discuss things I usually never discuss on GR, after all.I'm aware of the controversy surrounding this author and this book series.I'm not ignoring the problem, I'm simply choosing to keep my thoughts on the matter private and my general beliefs silent, except for serious situations that require me to speak up about them out loud or environments where I know judgement or opposition would come in a respectful manner and not in the form of bullying and name calling.Unfortunately, that doesn't always seem to be the case here on GR, these days.I'm publicly choosing to read this book acknowledging what's going on behind the scenes, and my review will simply be that: an objective and honest book review like the hundreds I've written before, as my hobby and favorite pastime.It won't nor shouldn't be my opinion telling others what they can or can't, should or shouldn't read in their free time and how to use their money or to consume the media they purchased.If I had that type of influence, I most certainly wouldn't be spending my spare moments reviewing books for free.Iam choosing, for myself, to leave a review that has nothing to do with the person who wrote this book or her political views, and it's between me, my objectivity and my conscience to decide how this will play out.I don't need to state this, but before anyone starts throwing around terms and essays, my support and prayers go out to people who are suffering. I chose to do something about the delicate and important matters we're discussing (and those conflicts and natural catastrophes I rarely see discussed here, because, guess what? 1) it's GoodREADS not GoodWORLDWIDENEWS and 2) the world sucks everywhere and it's been sucking for a really long time), but you won't hear me being vocal about it, because I've learnt you don't have to boast about your actions and contributions to be a good person. That sometimes those who are lousy and loud with words, just like the idea of being good without really acting on it.I'm choosing to help whoever I feel needs helping in a way that's suited to my personal beliefs and that has nothing to do with the books I prefer to engage with.I'm choosing to remain neutral when it comes to sharing political views on a site dedicated to book tracking; war and death are a reality I'll never turn away from.And if separating art from the artist isn't a tolerated choice, I hope keeping my private life and my reader life separate will be more understandable.I hope those who disagree with my choice to refrain from sharing my political views, will give me the benefit of the doubt, as I'll try to do with them and their ideals.If you wanna talk politics or discuss what an author has or hasn't done, my comment section isn't the place. If you also wanna unfriend/unfollow me for this or because any of my reading/life choices make you uncomfortable, please go ahead. No hard feelings on my part, really. It'll be sad to see some I considered close friends go, but I understad.

Not that this one wasn\'t great, but it didn\'t give the same feelings as the first one did when it hooked me instantly because of the Parapet scene.Many things didn\'t work for me.The start of this book wasn\'t as exciting... (she was eating freaking biscuits). And Brennan\'s revealation and all were just so avg and boring? A lot of info dumps too. The Dragons made this book better.The first 30% of this book is filled with \'You don\'t trust me enough\' drama between Xaden and Vi, which was seriously getting on my nerves.I get that she\'s hurt, but she was being absolutely ridiculous, demanding info while withholding it as a form of retaliation. Her inner monologue about being a \'bad friend\' and always \'feeling guilty\' for lying again and again was constantly on repeat. NO ACTION NOTHING NADA. I felt bad for Rhiannon as she tried again and again and always checked up on her. Rhiannon deserved better! 😭🔪SPOILERS:🔪So, I\'ll start with my fav,—TAIRN CARRIED THIS WHOLE BOOK. PERIOD. He\'s so damn possessive, and I\'m dying at how powerful and protective he is of Violet! He\'s so freaking savage, I can write so much about him! I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS DRAGON 😌💕“You do not have the right to burn what is mine.”“Apologize,” Tairn demands, his voice low and sharp. “I’m sorry!” Varrish’s voice breaks. “Apologize to the one Andarna deemed worthy of her bond.""“I chose you last year for that brilliance, and now you’d like to be congratulated like it’s something new? How odd.” “You’re impossible to impress.” “I’m a dragon, a Black Morningstartail. The descendant of—”—Tairn\'s and Andarna\'s banter was so fun ughhhhh I really enjoyed that!!!! 🥹 Both are so sarcastic and witty now! Andarna my cutieeee 🤭“Scratch her eyes out,” Andarna suggests. “Really. The eyes are the softest tissue. Just jab your thumbs in there—” “Andarna! Use some common sense,” Tairn snaps. “The kneecaps are a much easier target.”“Can you carry a luminary?” “That question insults me.” “Can you carry a luminary while insulted?” she prods”""Adolescent.""—How can I not fall for Xaden when he says things like:“She’s worth a dozen of me.""“I will happily watch Aretia burn to the fucking ground again if it means you live.""“I’m in love with you. I have been since the night the snow fell in your hair and you kissed me for the first time. I’m grateful my life is tied to yours because it means I won’t have to face a day without you in it. My heart only beats as long as yours does, and when you die, I’ll meet Malek at your side.—I\'m dying at how much Dain is roasted in this book! 💀 It\'s like the author read all of our reviews about him.“He’s trying desperately for Xaden’s charisma and coming up woefully short”“Garrick has always been my best friend. His father was my father’s aide, which in a way makes him my Dain, except trustworthy”“He’s not slowing down,” I murmur. Part of me hopes Dain falls off.”Me when Jack mf Barlowe entered:jdkskdhaha please he had no business pretending to be kind 😭 I was cackling! like IMAGINE a nice jack barlowe? *snort*. A wise man once said, ""once a bitch, always a bitch""TOXICITY AT ITS PEAK:Xaden and Violet went from being a couple who support each other to being borderline toxic. They were restricted to meet only two days, and it was spent fighting! THEY FOUGHT AT EVERY CHANCE THEY GOT!""you didn\'t tell.""""you didn\'t ask.""THIS SHOULD BE THE BLURB. This freaking drama grated on my nerves, and I was tired of how much this phrase was used. LIKE STOP? Everybody knew that Xaden is not sharing everything just to protect her life, and to a certain extent, I understand Violet, and I agree with her.but she\'s being so immature and whiny, and I swear this book just kind of ruined her character in many ways because she was always back to this old topic, and they constantly fought each other, and Violet constantly defied Xaden again and again (as in risking her life) and then made up eventually.The author really tried to put angst into their story with smut, but tbh I DO NOT PREFER THEM AS A COUPLE (at least not rn). The love was too quick, and the amount of trust issues, insecurities, and fights they had was so wrong and unhealthy. Xaden was being protective of her and hiding truths from her for her OWN SAFETY! and saying from experience, fantasy girlies do not like overprotective bfs. AND ADDING CATRIONA IN IT? That was the worst! The whole ex-jealousy thing was insane. and if this keeps going on, I don\'t think XadenVi will be the endgame (there are 5 books ffs)• side characters:For me,Rhiannonstole the show. She\'s so mature and amazing? and I love her sm! How she kept calm and been patient and supported Violet, and she\'s so damn skillful? SHE DESERVED APPRECIATION AND I\'M GLAD SHE GOT IT. She\'s super genius and literally figured most of the things out and told Violet that \'she\'ll wait for her to tell her everything\' like GURLLLLL 🥺🥰🤭💕Dain\'sreasoning was prettyyy... reasonable? I knew and already predicted what he would say, and it turned out I was correct! I liked his redemption arc though and realized that I cursed him way too much 😂 ok, Dain, you can be back on my okay-ish list. and HE HAD NO RIGHT TO COPY XADEN\'S LINES 💀AARIC GRAYCASTLEY\'ALL (not his real name but will do) jekdjs he\'s so hot? 😭 GREEN EYES ARE A BIG WEAKNESS, and I truly see him getting bigger parts in the other books cuz duh he\'s so freaking amazing and .... royal. He\'s the next Liam 🥹 (sans the death part). HE CARES FOR VIOLET TOO, DADDY ISSUES AND IS CUTIEEE! I low-key ship him and Violet together hhahahaha and pls no sloaneAaric.Sloanewas seriously just different than Liam lol! I expected too much, but she was not that important in this book besides Violet constantly checking up on her. Ngl some scenes/hallucinations of Liam made me so happy and sad. 🥹Rodichdkejs he\'s so good, and his character damn he\'s actually pretty amazing! I\'m glad his character got recognized a lot in this book!Varrishsoooo weirddd sooo creepyyyyy! 👺 I hated him so much and what he did with Violet? HE DESERVED A PAINFUL DEATH WTH! I loved when he begged violet on his knees like bishhhh you deserve that.General SorrengailMOTHER. 🫡 The quote where she told her husband THAT EVERYTHING SHE EVER DID WAS JUST TO SAVE HER CHILDREN! 💔“Most generals dream of dying in service to their kingdom. But you know me better than that, my love.When I fall, it will be for one reason only: to protect our children.”Now, all said, I truly think that this book was too long, and a lot of things were super tough and descriptive like: runes...?what the fuck were those? I read many times and I came with a seizure because why are they even added? A second reread would help, but I won\'t go there anytime soon. A lot of elements of this book were so weird that I prefer book 1 A LOT!what the actual fuckery?(the ending ofcourse)I can finally sleep now as I haven\'t slept more than 5 hours just to finish this book.I\'m sorry but I didn\'t know about this author being zionist when I read this book and I didnt contribute to her financially and all as I read the pirated version. I\'m not supporting gen0cide at all!RATINGS:• Fourth Wing– 5 stars• Iron Flame – 3.75 stars• Onyx Storm– tbr'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""|| 2.0 stars ||Well, damn. This was incredibly disappointing...I don’t even really know where to start with this review, because I feel like I have so many complaints.First and foremost, let’s start with one of the book’s most glaring issues: the writing was genuinelybad. It’s as plain and simple as that. This whole thing dragged like crazy and I was just so bored most of the time. Not only that, the writing was also painfully shallow. Nothing and no one had depth: all of the characters were completely one-dimensional and the plot failed to be interesting or engaging in any way.Speaking of the characters, let’s go on with my complaints by talking about our failure of a main character. I don’t know what happened to Violet between this one and the previous book, but I don’t recognize her whatsoever. She used to be the perfect balance of kind and bad-ass with a clever and sharp mind to boot! But now this girl we all knew and loved disappeared completely and instead we got this whiny, insecure idiot without a single rational thought going on inside that annoying brain of hers. I suddenly couldn’t stand her anymore!Same goes for Xaden: he suffered from major character assassination as well. He used to be strong, smart, mysterious, intriguing, and swoony as hell, but that was all gone now. Xaden turned into the most flat character ever, and he had no depth whatsoever. He truly felt like a robot to me, and I lost all interest in him. He is gone for most of the book, and at first I really missed his presence, but after a while, I was just bored every time he came on page, because I knew he would be the same repetitive and annoying character he was during all his other scenes, so I kind of didn’t care anymore if he was gone or not.The fact that both Violet and Xaden turned into insufferable characters is probably a big reason as to why their romance was terrible in this book too. First of all, after the end of the first book Ineededto get some groveling from Xaden, but did we get that here? No. Not even for a second. Xaden wasn’t sorry, he wasn’t regretful, he wasn’t trying to earn back Violet’s trust. No. He didn’t do anything. He didn’t even fight for Violet to forgive him. He was just... waiting. Not lifting a single finger to get back the woman he supposedly loves. He was so cocky in knowing that Violet would crawl back to him anyway that he refused to do anything to speed up the process. He just waited. And I guess he was right, because our spine-less heroine did indeed take him back without getting anything in return: no promises, no trust. Just nothing.Which obviously leads to a very unhealthy relationship between them where they don’t trust each other and in which they refuse to communicate. EVER. All they do is be horny and have sex, but they never actually talk anymore. They don’t confide in each other and neither do they let themselves fully open up to the other. Their entire relationship was just shallow, boring and irritating. I no longer liked anything about it. And then we even got some goddamn other woman drama, and my patience just vanished! I hated it.Now, when it comes to the side characters I don’t even know where to begin, because I feel like none of them were written well or with any depth to them. It’s like the author could never seem to focus on more than a few characters at the same time, so whenever she wanted to pay attention to one side character, all the other side characters just fell away. For example: at the beginning of this book we have quite a lot of focus on Imogen, and I was really seeing some amazing progress between her and Violet. I thought I saw the start of a beautiful friendship forming between them. But then, the moment Rhiannon started coming back into the fold (after being ignored in the first part), Imogen completely fell away again and her relationship with Violet never picked up. It’s like the author couldn’t handle Violet having more than one close female friend; she couldn’t focus on both at the same time. And therefore, neither Imogen or Rhiannon ever truly felt like friends to Violet because they were often suddenly ignored in her inner monologue or in the story. They were more like decoration, like tools to further the story along. Thus, none of Violet’s friends ever feel like real characters on their own..I loved the dragons in the first book; they were my favourite part of the entire book. But now, I couldn’t care less. Tairn used to be this sassy, grumpy dad-type, but now he was just a flat, monotone character with no real personality. Everything he said was repetitive, and his entire character just seemed way too simple and lacking any sort of depth. When it came to Andarna, I genuinely think her entire character was butchered. She used to be this cute and precious little baby, and now she turned into someone annoying, bitchy and arrogant without any meaningful connection to Violet. She was like an entitled teenager, and there’s a reason why nobody likes those.Of course, there were also other characters of whom I was really looking forward to seeing their story develop, but I didn’t get anything remotely satisfying when it came to them. Liam’s sister was only in a few scenes and in most of them she was just flat-out exasperating; everything about her character was anti-climactic.More importantly however, I feel like Dain just got completely ignored during this entire book. He used to be Violet’s best friend for such a long time and after it is revealed he didn’t even really do anything to betray her, Violet doesn’t remotely seem to care?? She doesn’t think about him and she doesn’t give him the time of day... she sort of forgives him but not really?? It was so weakly developed and I honestly expected more. It was, once again, very anti-climactic.Long story short, the only reason I somewhat enjoyed this book, and why I even finished it, is because I still felt a semblance of attachment to the story and these characters after book one, but even that wasn’t enough to keep me engaged for long enough. I couldn’t help but skim near the end of this book, because I was just so bored. I genuinely didn’t care anymore, and this book was just way too long for no reason. All in all, this was one big disappointment to me.'The Empyrean' series:1.Fourth Wing- 4.5 stars2.

Yet it was so enjoyable and exciting. I loved it in all its imperfections. Xaden and Violet have my heart and the series seems to be getting darker and more powerful. But oh how I ate it all up 🤭Was it better than Fourth Wing?The plot certainly was better but I do think people will find its execution a bit messy in general.Is it binge worthy?Absolutely, you just need time.So A LOT happens in this one, in fact way more than the first book.This book is so action packed and relationship focused, I didn\'t think I could love this series more but I really do.The best part about this was Tairn and Andarna. No one can tell me otherwise. I came in to love Xaden and Violet but the dragons... AHHHH 😩😩❤The book picks up immediately after the events of Fourth Wing and with no time wasted we jump into the story. Iliked the addition of new charactersand the way they all had their own personalities yet never overpowering.Felixand his sarcastic arse was top notch. I liked how he kept things real. I do believe the transition ofSolane\'sissues with Violet could have been smoothened a bit considering how strong she came to be. I absolutely LOATHEDVarrish.He\'s the equivalent of Umbridge I swear. Hated, hated, hated him. Those who have read Fourth Wing know, am not mentioning one of the characters, but I\'ll just say- his dynamic with Violet was chef\'s kiss 🤌""I want you exactly how you are, emotions and all. I want the woman I fell for...""🩶I lovedXadenand Violet.The groveling and reassurance THROUGHOUT the book was everything!!So we all know how things were left in Fourth Wing, and I expected Xaden to grovel his way for a few pages but our girl Violet made him grovel the whole time and I LOVED it. He was patient with her, he took his time with her. He made mistakes in this one too but he owned up to it and gave her answers.❤️\u200d🔥She had 100 questions? He answered them all. She asked the same question a million times? He answered it each and every damn time. Someone tried to make her jealous? He confidently claimed and assured her every time. Yeah, exactly! That\'s the kind of man he is 🤭😌⚡I adoredVioletin this. Let\'s be honest, there will be a lot of people who will find her annoying and insecure in this one. I personally did not. To me it made sense. Everyone lied to her throughout her whole life. Almost every new person wants to kill her. She lost someone very close to her. Her issues with Cat although wasn\'t really necessary but made sense. It gave Xaden and Violet the opportunity to become confident in each other and gave the opportunity to trust each other again. I loved Violet was patient and open towards Xaden, well eventually 🤭🐉Now let\'s get tomy babies- Tairn and Andarna.Y\'all if you adored them in the last book? You will LOVE them in this. Tairn was his sarcastic self, caring self and always giving his Silver One wisdom. I absolutely LOVED Andarna. Her adolescent self was so snarky, it was adorable. I wanted to protect them both, and especially my baby Andarna. Her reveals(Yes, multiple reveals 👀)had me gasping. I can\'t wait to see what else is in store for them.🔥Theside characters- Ridoc, Sawyer, Imogen and Rhiwere such good friends. The way they supported Violet through thick and thin. They had each other\'s backs. Sawyer and Jesina? They\'ll be cute together if it happens 🤭 These four kept me laughing. They made the two main characters real and brought life to the book. B and Mira 🫡🤡Dain and Cat-Bro now idk what to think about them 😭😩 It feels weird. No they\'re not a couple or anything, just two idiotic characters....""I would have done the same thing you did because I\'m just as reckless for you as you are for me.""The romance. The spice. The action. The plot twists. The drama. The reveals. The writing. PERFECT🤭🤭 I believe the torture scenes and the training bits were the best written parts as it showed how deep all of their bond was. Butthat one scene(can\'t spoil) had me bawling my eyes out, so heart touching and I just wanted to hold and hug him 😭😭😭❤ Those who have read it will know 😭The reveals at theendtho OH MY GOSHHHH. Yes it\'s true I got spoiled for the ending but I didn\'t let it get to me. I was bummed but I ate it up because of how well Rebecca Yarros wrote it. The action was so good!! I couldn\'t put the book down at all. The cliffhanger tho 😭😭😭😭DAMN BRUTAL. DAMN. BRUTAL.Am gonna be obsessed with the next one too 😩😩 Can\'t wait for it.Be kind on the review. Or just move on, I won\'t tolerate any harassment on my reviews against my friends or me.~•~•~LET\'S GOOOOO'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'I thought the first half of this book was close to unbearable and the second half was riveting.Why an editor didn\'t suggest shaving off a hundred or so pages of this book I do not know. It would be quite easy. Just get rid of the constant repetitive repetitious:“How am I supposed to really love you if I don’t know you?”and“He doesn’t trust me.” I shrug. “And I can’t really trust him. It’s complicated.”Because, god, it\'sreally notthat complicated. The romantic will they/won\'t they mostly played out inFourth Wing(of course they will) so having to sit through loads of faux love angst about ""oh, Xaden, how can I know you? How can I trust you? Fuck, you have a hot ass"" was so boring. Not to mention the fact that Yarros\' smutty talk is kinda cringe.I was so so close to skimming during the first half BUT I have to say I thought the book went on to redeem itself a lot in the second half.The politics and magic of this world are surprisingly quite interesting when they manage to rear their head in between Violet and Xaden\'s theatrics. Yarros developed side characters further and I really came to love the camaraderie between Violet, Rhi, Sawyer and Ridoc, as well as the developing relationships and tensions with new characters. I love the voices of the dragons. I enjoyed Varrish as a villain (one of the few things I did enjoy about the first half.)When we reached the battles at the climax of the novel, I couldn\'t look away. The action scenes were suspenseful and dramatic and the ending, though a bit predictable, made me actually interested in reading the next book.I admit I was shocked to discover three more books are planned.

I\'m going to need a moment to process all this.Many moments later...Right, onto my thoughts.Allow me a second to gush here. I love it when a book knows what it\'s there to do, and that is to entertain the reader. It isn\'t there to be slow or boring or god forbid, pretentious (shudders). Rather, its goal is to squeeze every ounce of joy and delight out of the pages, and that\'s what this series does best.Cracking open the first page, I was sucked right back into the world of Navarre and Violet Sorrengail. It\'s as if I\'ve never left it. Everything I loved from the first book is here—nonstop action, characters I could root for, snarky dragons, and sizzling romance. I couldn\'t turn the pages fast enough.The only thing I didn\'t love was our main couple having squabbles for half the book over reasons I couldn\'t make heads or tails of. I get that Rebecca Yarros has to inject some sort of strife between them to keep things interesting, but I was just confused. But if it\'s that or hundreds of pages of lovey-dovey mush, I guess I\'ll take confounding couple problems any day.I always have a sliver of trepidation going into book 2 of a series. What if my enjoyment of the first book was a fluke, a figment of my imagination? Or that the author somehow found the magical formula once, but can\'t reproduce it again? Or worse, that there\'s no interesting story left to tell? But I needn\'t worry becauseIron Flamecontains all the magic of its predecessor.I will say though, going in, the length at more than 600 pages was a bit daunting. But once I started, it didn\'t even matter. I was riveted throughout. It felt like every single page served a purpose—except for the aforementioned confounding couple problems—building momentum and eventually hurtling towards a stunning conclusion. Honestly, if there were another 600 pages, I\'d happily gobble those up too.Before this book, I admit I was a bit puzzled that there could be five books in this series, like how much more is there to this story? But seeing the way Yarros has built out the universe and the war in this book, and especially that ending, I get now how there could be so much more to this. And I\'m glad. I\'m not sure I\'m ready to say goodbye to Navarre any time soon, so I\'m happy there are still a few more books to come. I just hope the wait isn\'t too long.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:#1.Fourth Wing~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""1 StarAlright, I'm not going to rant or be very specific in this review because I know many people are still currently reading the book.

It was littered with fillers.My favorite parts were mostly the action scenes and the dragon scenes.I wasn\'t a big fan of the development of the romance in this one, there were tender and hot moments but that still didn\'t make up for how the relationship seemed to go in circles rather than grow. Maybe that\'s because Xaden\'s development was.....meh? Not that Violet\'s development was any better.I absolutely loved the tension between Violet and Xaden in Fourth Wing, but once the relationship passes that phase it\'s tricky for authors to keep it interesting and it certainly fell short in this sequel.I don\'t know if I\'m the only one who feels this way but this book was heavy in dialogue and information dump and that\'s why it felt like it was dragging..The drama between some of the characters had me roll my eyes because most of it was so unnecessary we could be doing other far more interesting things than this.I\'ll just highlight a few spoilers below to get some points across so beware..............[Iron Flame Spoilers Ahead].............First of all, the jealous ex trope should be on every author\'s list of banned tropes. It always results in unnecessary drama and tension between the couple that I do not need especially when they have far more important issues they need to resolve between them. Imighttolerate it if they weren\'t an established couple, but if they are then that\'s a big no no for me.I wanted to throw my kindle at the wall. It\'s just frustrating to read about.And speaking of Violet and Xaden\'s relationship, dancing around the whole ""trust"" issue while still hiding things from each other simply because the other didn\'t bother to ""ask"" was annoying and did not add anything to their relationship but to create unnecessary tension. Did Xaden actuallyworkfor earning back Violet\'s trust or was he just waiting around for whenever the time was convenient? And Violet\'s judgement and choices were often clouded by her longing and lust for Xaden.Still I found some of their scenes tender and sexy but it definitely is less appealing to me than it was in Fourth Wing. Their relationship has less substance now.Because of how lukewarm my emotions were throughout most of the book, the ending did not gut me as much.These thoughts reflect my own experience while reading this book.'}]"

Alice Oseman continues to deliver queer joy and charming storytelling with an adorable balance of cute romance and earnest investigations of heavy, complex emotions. It feels like it has been forever but it’s so lovely to be back with this crew.Heartstopperhas always plunged into difficult yet relatable subjects and this fifth volume is no different. Oseman has always done an excellent job at crafting her characters to feel like authentic teenagers and here we get to witness them growing up a bit more and heading into the next stage of life: college. We also get to experience Nick setting out in the world on his own while Charlie is back at home and even after 5 marvelous volumes I’m always thrilled to find the characters reading as increasingly nuanced yet still familiar. Going away to college issues were addressed in Oseman’s much earlier novellaNick and Charlie, and while this touches on some similar themes this is a completely different story.Though college isn’t the only hurdle here, as anxieties about sex dominate a lot of Charlie’s narrative. As always, Oseman does a great job at representing these issues in an age-authentic way and the character’s emotions practically jump right off the page. There’s some other interesting dynamics to this story too, from discussions on asexuality and also a peek into Charlie’s mom’s childhood. While some of the side characters are a bit more in the background, I’ve always found the series does a good job of making them all rather dynamic and interesting instead of all just extensions of the main characters.All in all, this is another heartwarming edition to an already endearing series. I can’t wait for the next volume, though *gasp* I hear it is to be the final episode in the Heartstopper saga.5/5'}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""wAIT, WHY IT SAYS 2023 AND FINAL INSTALMENT?

I smile politely, gazing around the marble hallway. Working here is my last chance to start fresh. I can pretend to be whoever I like. But I’ll soon learn that the Winchesters’ secrets are far more dangerous than my own…Every day I clean the Winchesters’ beautiful house top to bottom. I collect their daughter from school. And I cook a delicious meal for the whole family before heading up to eat alone in my tiny room on the top floor.I try to ignore how Nina makes a mess just to watch me clean it up. How she tells strange lies about her own daughter. And how her husband Andrew seems more broken every day. But as I look into Andrew’s handsome brown eyes, so full of pain, it’s hard not to imagine what it would be like to live Nina’s life. The walk-in closet, the fancy car, the perfect husband.I only try on one of Nina’s pristine white dresses once. Just to see what it’s like. But she soon finds out… and by the time I realize my attic bedroom door only locks from the outside, it’s far too late.But I reassure myself: the Winchesters don’t know who I really am.They don’t know what I’m capable of…An unbelievably twisty read that will have you glued to the pages late into the night.

IYKYK, my reviews are always honest.Writing: idk out of 5 | Plot: ????2???/5 | Ending: 5/5 tbhAfter letting this marinate for a couple of hours, 2 stars is the way to go.THE PLOTMillie is living in Casa Nissan aka her car when she\'s hired as the maid for the Winchesters, a ridiculously wealthy family. She\'s over the moon to have a job and a bed, but she quickly realizes something funky is happening in the home. And she\'s not sure if she\'ll make it out alive... dun dun dunnnnnn!!!!!MY OPINIONHonestly... I\'m confusion. This is how I felt after I readThe Trapped Wifeby Samantha Hayes. On one hand, this was garbagio, on the other hand, it had some things that kept me reading and enjoying myself. It\'s a book I love to hate and hate to love all at once. Ok, let me try to make sense of thoughts:- Millie\'s POV is straight up ""dear diary"" style. As in, ""I spent 7 hours cleaning the house and I thought about Andy Winchester\'s bangin bod the entire time. He is so dreamy. Does he like me too????"" It\'s also giving me ""rages to riches"" fanfic written by a tween vibes. BUT AT THE SAME DAMN TIME... the book was legit funny in parts???? Like great dark humour throughout????- Millie\'s character makes no sense. Not a spoiler—she spends 10 years in jail. Yet she has zero survival skills and seems relatively unbothered by the fact she was locked up for an entire decade. I\'m telling you right now I can\'t last 10 MINUTES in jail unscathed, so a whole ass decade would have me coming out on some Rambo shit.- I did not like Nina. She was over the top, selfish, and illogical. I can\'t feel sorry for what she went through because .... No spoilers.... but if you read it, you\'ll know.- The ""mystery"" is kinda obvious. It\'s likeThe Wife Between Usmixed with... idk,Gone Girl? There wasn\'t really any suspense. You know what\'s gonna happen. From Part II onward I was speed reading like a mf. But I was invested in the whole revenge vibe like ok girl go OFFFFFF.- I gave the ending 5/5 because it\'s women\'s history month and that\'s all I can say without spoiling it- I\'ve readThe Locked Doorby this author and this was a totally different vibe. Good for her for going in a totally different direction with no projection of her medical career/knowledge in the story. I\'m not sure if it worked, but at least the ending was better than Locked Door.I can see people really enjoying this or really hating it. Do not expect this to be a literary masterpiece. You will not be mentally stimulated in any way. This is your standard popcorn thriller but not as annoying as Unmissing, Stay Awake, etc because of the dark humour. This is the type of book you read afterMy Dark Vanessarips your heart out and stomps all over it.PROS AND CONSPros: you\'ll keep reading because you don\'t know if you like it or hate it, awesome dark humour, great endingCons: vapid plot and characters, rags to riches fanfic written by a 14 yo vibes, dear diary ass writing'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '“The Housemaid” by Freida McFadden is just one of those novels that for years to come, I will speak highly of and recommend to anyone that wants an incredible thriller. One that’s also filled with mystery and psychological terror all wrapped together brilliantly. From McFadden’s excellent writing style to all the characters I absolutely loved, this is easily one of the best novels of 2022.It’s a very addictive read that is so hard to put down, you’ll more than likely find yourself reading deep into the night because it’s a genuine page-turner. I loved all the little revelations that pop up here and there on top of an incredible story. Just when you think you have it figured out, this novel turns your world upside down.Don’t worry, I will not go into any specifics or spoil anything for you but I’d consider this a must-read novel. Besides the fantastic pacing, I also loved all the New York references since I’m a New Yorker and it really felt close to home. Thinking back on everything, I can’t tell you how many authentic jaw-dropping moments I had while reading this as this novel completely blew my mind.The ending was beyond satisfying and just something I didn’t expect at all! LoL saying it was a drop-the-mic moment is an understatement. This was a wild, insane, fun, adrenaline-filledthriller that kept me on the edge of my seat. It was a wonderful reading experience as I wish every novel I read was like this!I give “The Housemaid” by Freida McFadden a perfect 5/5 as this is a masterpiece. I’ve read many novels in my life and this is one of the most memorable ones that will forever stand out for me. This novel was unique, exciting, and everything you could ever want in a thriller and then some. It’s a rollercoaster of a read from start to finish and I can honestly say that McFadden has a new reader in me. This was the first novel I’ve read by her and I’m genuinely excited to read more of her work and whatever future novels she writes. She is an amazing author with one incredibly creative and talented mind!'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '3.5 stars — I decided to read another Freida McFadden book because I wanted a page turner that didn’t require much thinking. “The Housemaid” had gotten numerous high reviews so I decided to try it. The book started off very good and had me hooked from the beginning. It tells the story of Millie a recent parolee who is homeless and in need of a job. When she gets hired by Nina and Andrew as a live-in housemaid/nanny she believes she has found her dream job. But soon she realizes that Nina is a very difficult person to work for (think Meryl Streep in “The Devil Wears Prada”). I really enjoyed the interactions between Millie and Nina and her family. I was squarely in the 4.5 to 5 stars range up until the final 30 pages or so of the book. I won’t spoil it but to say the actions of the police, Enzo, Millie and Nina were ridiculous is such an understatement of how bad this book came to a close I can’t describe it. I don’t remember yelling out “No” and “come on” and “really” while reading a book before. (Yes I’m weird) but I had no choice considering the epic plot collapse that left me shaking my head. Even with a full 1 star reduction I enjoyed the book and will have to read the sequel to see if McFadden can return to the form that had me on the edge of my seat for the first 90 percent of the book.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'This book is not as clever as it thinks it is.Everyone is trying to gaslight everyone else and it’s messy.We know next to nothing about Millie for at least 60% of the novel…so why are we supposed to care about her?Millie could make more of an effort with Enzo. Italian to English is right there on your damn phone.Nina’s chapters are bizarre.I’m still not sure what the “big” twist is. There are several reveals, but nothing earth-shattering.This tries to be an upscale version of Minka Kent...or a low-budget version of Sarah Pinborough. But the characters are so thinly developed that the author leaves everything to hinge on plot—a dubious choice, at best.You probably won’t want to put it down. But you will be asking yourself what the hell you just read.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""The plot twist in this book got me good!! I never ever saw it coming🤯. I love how this book started out so creepy and eerie, with Nina behaving so weirdly, and then really escalated in the second half to full-on dangerous. I also love how Millie is so mysterious. We don't know much about her for a huge chunk of the book. It was fun to slowly unravel more of her back story. The only downside to that, though, is that it did take me a little bit to care about Millie because we didn't know a lot about her in the beginning.Overall 4 stars!

After all the buzzing hype surrounding this book that never seems to diminish, I finally decided it was time to dive in and award myself some entertaining popcorn reading. However, oh boy, this book absolutely deserves every bit of its never-ending hype. It exceeded my expectations, had me gritting my teeth, squirming restlessly in my seat, and, even though I anticipated the delicious twist from the beginning, I still admired how the author perfectly developed this smart cat-and-mouse game. The last third, in particular, was exceptionally brilliant! I knew right from the beginning that I would enjoy this heart-throbbing, jaw-dropping, unputdownable, twisty psychological thriller, but I didn't expect to love it even more and immediately decided to jump into the next book of the series, despite some reviews emphasizing that it might not be as good as the first one. I just couldn't resist spending more time in Millie the maid's disturbing, mind-bending world!Meet Millie: recently released from prison for a crime we don't know if she committed or what kind of crime she got involved in. She's homeless, living in her Nissan, worn down from her latest job at the bar, getting rejected even from burger joints, barely having a chance to start over at her young age (she's in her mid-twenties, a pretty girl, but she disguises her beauty behind glasses and baggy clothes, just in case somebody thinks she's too attractive to be hired). She can't believe her luck when her application as a housemaid at Winchester House (correction: it's a mansion surrounded by a gate with a beautiful landscape) is approved by Nina Winchester: a stay-at-home wife, a bit overweight, dressed only in white, a sophisticated woman who seems friendly at first sight.Millie is introduced to Nina's little girl, who looks like she jumped out of a Children of the Corn movie with her weird baby doll dress, white-blond hair, and spoiled brat attitude that rubs her the wrong way. Then there's the father, the breadwinner of the family, the overly handsome Andrew Winchester, who seems like Prince Charming and whom Millie can barely stop herself from drooling over.Millie doesn't mind that she has to live in the attic, with a room that has the tiniest window that never opens and a lock outside the door that mostly gets stuck. She also keeps herself in check as Nina's emotionally unstable behavior pushes her buttons until they nearly fall to the floor. She can't flip the bird to her unsatisfied, bickering, witchy employer and her irritating, annoying little daughter because if she doesn't get a good reference from her employer, she's forced to live in her car, violating her parole, which could send her back to prison. She keeps her mouth shut, but it's not easy to deal with Nina's mood swings.When she learns a dirty little secret about Nina's past and gets warned by the hot, candy-like landscaper Enzo, who unfortunately speaks only Italian, she realizes that by accepting this job, she may be putting her life in danger. Especially when it's so tempting to get seduced by Mr. Winchester, while his wife watches them like a jealous hawk, ready to tear her limbs apart. Oh, Millie, you've found yourself in another prison you can't escape, haven't you?Overall, I'm giving this highly earned five stars and diving into the next novel of Millie the Maid as fast as possible! This story has truly captivated me, and I can't wait to see where Millie's adventures take her next.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5/5 ★’s⁀➷❝you…pericolo.❞danger.°❀⋆.ೃ࿔*:･𝓼𝓹𝓸𝓲𝓵𝓮𝓻 𝓯𝓻𝓮𝓮 𝓻𝓮𝓿𝓲𝓮𝔀this was my first freida book and it has me feeling like i need to take a trip to the nearest psych ward. i finished this book inSIXhours.more like four because i spent two of those hours spam texting shei throughout the entire book🙈she pulled an all-nighter for me🥹🫂please go into my review with very low expectations because since it’s spoiler free…i won’t be able to say a lot🥺❥ 𝓂𝓎 𝓉𝒽𝑜𝓊𝑔𝒽𝓉𝓈:i’m convinced this entire book is laced with crack. whatever kind of drug that makes you completely lose your mind…this book is also laced with that😀from start to finish i was absolutely addicted. i couldn’t put it down. i was worried that i was going to dislike this book simply because it’s been awhile since i’ve read anything other than romance, but i absolutely loved it. speaking of romance…if you are a romance addict, ihighly recommendthis book to you. i’m giggling🤭i wanted a good mind fuck and freida really said: bitch, you’re going to get more than just a mind fuck. this story was so terrifying that it gave me nightmares😀thanks freida💋that was some twisted ass shit fr🥲❥ 𝓅𝓁𝑜𝓉:the plot was plotting. plotting against me. i am a victim. freida, bae, quick question.how could you?the plot twists…my jaw was on the floor and i still haven’t picked it up yet. this book had me thinking i had everything figured out one minute and then completely confused the next. i always had it in the back of my mind of what could’ve possibly happened, but when shit happened…idk what i expected, but let me just tell you that it wasn’t THAT. almost had me sprinting to the bathroom to throw up! i won’t say much more because i encourage everyone to go into this book blindly! it’ll give you the best experience <3❥ 𝓌𝓇𝒾𝓉𝒾𝓃𝑔:bone chilling. i would not survive a single minute in freida’s mind, but i’d still pay to live a day in there anyways. she’s an absolute genius. at one point i was like: is this a romance or a mystery/thriller?

How does this have such a high rating?WHAT TO EXPECT:✨ psychological thriller✨ mystery✨ plot twists✨ TW: infidelity, domestic abuse, torture, toxic relationship, murder, death (this is not a complete list, so be sure to research the trigger warnings before)My Thoughts:What a fucking waste of my time. I am annoyed I read this book and cannot believe it came so highly recommended. There\'s so much I can say but I\'ll keep this review short since I don\'t want to spend more time thinking about this book than I have to.I hardly ever read thrillers yet I was able to predict everything.I honestly wish I DNF\'d but I decided to keep going for the big plot twists that I was told would completely surprise me; but alas, they did not. The author basically tells you what\'s going to happen next by making the narrator have internal dialogue that panders to the reader. Here are a few examples.1. The FMC, Millie, enters the room she will be living in and goes,""There was something about that room that was very scary.""Oooooo, I bet something terrible happened there. *I say this sarcastically*2. Millie meets the gardener and she notices,""There\'s something in his expression that sends a chill down my spine. And then he shakes his head, almost imperceptibly. Almost like he\'s trying to warn me.""And then he tells her it\'s dangerous and she should leave. Huh, I wonder why the gardener would tell a random woman she\'s in danger living in this rich suburban home as the maid. What could possibly go wrong?3. Millie meets the husband and immediately notices how hot he is.""It\'s hard not to notice that he is several levels more attractive than his wife.""And throughout the story she constantly comments on how handsome he is. I wonder what\'s going to happen between the super hot maid and her super hot employer. . .4. Millie\'s bedroom door locks from the outside and she notices there are scratches on the door,""Like somebody was scraping at the door. Trying to get out.""Cue the Cardi-B viral sound ""That\'s suspicious. That\'s weird."" We all know she\'s getting locked in that room at some point.There\'s a lot more but again, I don\'t want to spend more time on this book so, moving on to my next point.The writing was juvenile.Along with the author\'s penchant for pandering to the reader, the book was just so average written. It felt like someone in high school wrote it. Simple writing. Basic characters. Unrealistic development.Millie was an unbearable FMC.She\'s a recently released convict and has had a hard time keeping a job. She\'s desperate, which is why she overlooks all the red flags about this new job as a maid. But for fuck\'s sake, it\'s like she has zero self preservation. I absolutely hated her and the choices she made throughout the story. The only redeeming thing about her was how she handles everything at the end.But that ending has me laughing because of the sheer stupidity of it all.You\'re telling me Millie has been a dud for the entire book but somehow she comes out on top at the end? I don\'t believe it but whatever.Overall, this book was a miss and I do not recommend it. I should be giving this 1 stars because I legit didn’t like anything about it. But it was readable and even if predictable, there was a cohesive plot. . . so I’ll give it 1.5 stars.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Thank you to the publisher and NetGalley for providing me with a copy of this novel for an honest review. It has been published in April 2022.""The Housemaid"" by Freida McFadden was a bit of a disappointment to read.First of all, the tagline ""From behind closed doors, she sees everything"" must have been chosen by someone who never read the book, because it couldn\'t be farther from the truth: Millie goes through the novel blissfully unaware of everything that happens around her, be it behind closed doors or not. Even the most telegraphed plot twists somehow catch her by surprise, despite all the warning signs and the not-so-cryptic warnings she receives from other characters. The only ones who see everything from behind closed doors areAndrew and Enzo, and how sad it is thata novel written by a woman, with a woman as a protagonist, should depict both its female main characters as such hapless damsels in distress?Nina has no agency at all, she\'s only good to be rescued by her super-hot, muscled, Italian stud, and even Millie shows no initiative at all up until the very ending.On the good side, the narrative flows easily enough, making the read a quick one. On the not so good side, there are some huge plotholes that make the whole novel feel like a joke: for starters,Enzo\'s charade doesn\'t hold water. It\'s simply not believable that a man in his thirties who has lived and worked in the US for 3 years, being employed by a dozen families in such a posh neighbourhood, and who is considered the best at what he does, would not speak any English at all, not even the most basic communication that Italian children are taught in primary school. When we find out that he\'s just pretending, it\'s even worse! How would he ever get a job with all those very wealthy, very elitist families if he wasn\'t able to let on that he spoke the language? How would he be able to follow his customer\'s instructions, to the point that he\'s considered ""the best at his job"", if he had to pretend he didn\'t understand them at all?And what about the ""translating apps"" that Millie mentions in the very beginning of the book, hoping that they\'ll help her communicate with Enzo, except then she never uses them, never mentions them again and spends the rest of the novel complaining that she has no way of communicating with Enzo?What about the security guard who searches Millie on the basis of a random phonecall tipping him off about her alleged shoplifting? In the real world, no security guard in their right mind would do such a thing: they would more likely enquire who the person calling them is, and how can they know who is a shoplifter and describe how the shoplifter is dressed, since they\'re calling *from outside the shop*.How can Millie describe her new, tiny attic room in the Winchester house as an ""inhuman place, like a torture chamber"", when she\'s been living in the back of her car right before moving to said attic room, and has spent 10 years in jail right before that?Let\'s not even mention how far-fetched the twist aboutthe policeman\'s daughteris, and how it would be absolutely impossible to simplydrop an investigation like that, even if a random policeman decided to.Still, I wouldn\'t have minded the plotholes so much if the characterisation hadn\'t been so bad: literally all of the characters, including the protagonist, are nothing more than stock characters, flat, cartoonish figurines in no way relatable or interesting. On top of that, all 4 main characters (I\'m counting the 9-year-old brat as well, yes) are completely, irredeemably despicable. The only vaguely likeable character is Enzo, but then he\'s a walking stereotype, so in the end I didn\'t like him either.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'what in the batshit crazy, psycho, disturbing verity by colleen hoover was thatgive me more'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""It was a quick fun read, exactly what I needed. The book gripped me from the start and I struggled to put it down.The story is not something unique tbh. But the way it's told is chef's kiss.

The story is told in three parts, I found part 1 and part 2 to be quite predictable but part 3 is what wowed me.It is only when I learned Nina's truth, that I found myself sympathizing with her (to a limit).

I think I have only read 6 with 4 of them being Holly Jackson's books but that's pretty much it, and I remembered how quickly I read them and how much I enjoyed some of them so I decided that I was going to read a lot of thrillers when I got free in June and The housemaid was the first target and it's safe to say, I loved it. The way this was so fast paced and it had me hooked!! I would've read it in one sitting but because of Eid and having so many guests over and with my cousins coming to stay with us, it made it hard for me to binge read this but I still read a huge portion of it whenever I picked it up, I was literally forced to keep it down. I stand by what I said, thrillers are the hardest to write because it's a mess at the start, there are so many leads and only one culprit and the way you have to tie all of them together while keeping the reader hooked is a really hard job which Freida nailed 🤭 this book also gave me verity vibes and I was here for it.The story follows our main character Millie who's an ex-convict, desperate for a job. She finds one as a housemaid for the Winchesters and from there onwards her life starts to get messy. I would say Millie in this book was a badass, especially with how everything was done in the end 😭🤌🏻 wow just wow. I really liked her. I won't talk about Nina and Andrew because they are heavily tied to the plot and plot twists and well....I mean I guessed the main twist but not the intensity of it but some of you may not so I won't say anything except for how conflicting and interesting characters they were to read and 👀 Enzo 👀 can we get more scenes of him??In thrillers the one thing I learned was that it's never the first person who the MC thinks of as the culprit so my doubts were on someone else and I had predicted that it would be them but didn't know why or how and man 💀 that was fucked up, the intensity of what they did skyrocketed it really helped me feel for our victim.I also liked how well it was partitioned into three parts and how one followed mille then Nina and then both.Overall, I think that all that I can talk about without spoiling anything but I would definitely recommend it because I had an amazing time.____This is Freida McFadden's highest rated book.......let's see what the hype is all about 🤭(Let the June thriller tbr marathon begin!)""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '★4 stars“""I can’t seem to shake that uneasy feeling. That I should get out of here while I still can.""As this is aspoiler free reviewit\'s going to be short and sweet as I can\'t say too much. I can see why this psychological thriller is so popular! It\'s definitely a fast faced page turner.The plotMillie Calloway is hired to be an in-house maid for the Winchesters’ in a time when she is desperate, living out of her car and no one will take a chance on her. The Winchesters’ are a very well off, upper-class couple who have a 9 year old daughter, Cecila. When Millie enters the house she starts to realise that not everything is as perfect as it seems. Unfortunately for Millie, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.╰⪼Thoughts""There’s something about this room that’s making a little ball of dread form in the pit of my stomach.”The first 30% of the book was pretty slow for me but once I pushed past this it really picked up. This book is filled with plot twists and when you think you have it figured out, there\'s further reveals. It kept me on edge and while I did suspect some things earlier on, there was definitely a lot of build up towards the end that I didn\'t see coming 👀 The few twists I did guess didn\'t take away from my enjoyment of the book. This was my first Freida McFadden book and won\'t be my last.I found the writing style to be quite simple and the chapters were relatively short which made this book binge-worthy.The Housemaidis perfect if you are new to the thriller genre or picking one up after a long time. The few issues I had in the first 30% which kept my rating from being higher was that I felt the author was trying too hard to tell me how to feel as the hints and \'thriller elements\' weren\'t subtle. I also found the last couple of chapters to be a little rushed. I wanted to have chills but I sadly didn\'t feel that way but I was definitely hooked on this book.Overall, I thought the epilogue was fantastic and I can\'t wait to see what happens in books 2 and 3. This book is very entertaining and will whisk you away into the thick of it. There are some slight romance elements as well which might entice you to pick this up if you are new to thrillers.

You want to shake it loose, but you simply can\'t. It is so bizarro that you keep clicking on your cell phone to check if the world is still out there and you\'re not registered somewhere in a padded cell.Millie comes up short where luck is concerned. She\'s always been at the wrong place and at the wrong time pretty much all of her life. Millie\'s been living in her cramped little car for some time now. Her last job didn\'t pan out and she\'s counting the slices of her cheap bread and bologna. She can\'t even get a job flippin\' burgers. No good references. No good options.But then an ad has been posted for a live-in maid with light duties. Millie interviews with the elegant wife/mother in her elegant house with her elegant handsome husband. Against all odds, Millie gets the job. But Nina, her new boss, is a bit ""off"". Nina has spent some time in a psychiatric hospital. She spins on a dime from day to day. Cecelia, nine years old, is spoiled rotten and lights up Millie every chance she gets. Millie feels sorry for Andrew, the husband, who is caught in this emotional blender on high speed.Freida McFadden presents a whirlwind of events here. The pace and the short chapters keep this one afloat. The storyline has a familiar ring to it as those of us who\'ve read a billion psychological thrillers know. McFadden throws in a few zingers and twists to liven it up. Foolish people get fooled. Street-wise never do. But you press on just to experience the final outcome. And when it comes.....it comes. Not a blockbuster read by any means, but it\'s already been popular because of that eye-poking cover.

The person she hires will need to be desperate for a job, and have CERTAIN personality traits.Millie fits the criteria.She is willing to live in the tiny ATTIC room, with only one window, which seems to be painted shut, and has a lock on the OUTSIDE of the door-and she is tolerant of Cecelia who is dressed up like Wednesday from the Adams family, but definitely doesn’t have the manners of a pretty little girl.She must also need the job enough to also tolerate the split personality of Nina, herself!I enjoyed Millie’s sense of humor, and was curious to see where this would go-initially.Then came Part Two, and there is a SURPRISING twist, but it’s very OTT and the story goes off the rails at this point. 🚂And, in PART THREE, the story twists yet again.Sure, I realize this story is meant to be taken with a grain of salt, preferably served on buttered popcorn, 🍿 but, the last two parts were too crazy for my taste!But, there are MANY 5 star reviews so, IF the crazier the better is what you are looking for-it should satisfy YOU! 😉'}, {'rating': None, 'content': 'Pre-readThis is gonna be my first thriller so please be good🤞🏼'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Outlier alert!!Millie = the ex con has just being hired as a maid.

Her days of living in anonymity among the Humans are over: she has been called upon to uphold a historic peacekeeping alliance between the Vampyres and their mortal enemies, the Weres, and she sees little choice but to surrender herself in the exchange—again...Weres are ruthless and unpredictable, and their Alpha, Lowe Moreland, is no exception. He rules his pack with absolute authority, but not without justice. And, unlike the Vampyre Council, not without feeling. It’s clear from the way he tracks Misery’s every movement that he doesn’t trust her. If only he knew how right he was….Because Misery has her own reasons to agree to this marriage of convenience, reasons that have nothing to do with politics or alliances, and everything to do with the only thing she's ever cared about.

ALSO, if i wanna write an essay, you bet i will. i didn’t know there were rules to how we choose to write reviews! 🫣telling me to grow up but y’all are mad i didn't like your 2010 wattpad vampyre romance over a character named misery. y’all are miserable just like her name. commenting on reviews because you’re mad. 😂 you guys care way too much how strangers spend their own time, it's concerning.in reply to most comments i get:“get a job” i do, and it pays well. it pays more than enough for myself, for my bills, and for my food.“get a life” says the one commenting on a review they disagree with.“why spend your time reading her books” because i can. thanks for caring about how i chose to spend my own time.“did you need to write a whole essay?” did they never teach you in class how to write essays? these are bullet points. there’s a difference. but if i wanna write an ‘essay’ over a book i didn’t like, i will. maybe teach yourself what the words opinion and decision means.“it’s not that serious” so why are you mad?“you’re boring” good thing we aren’t friends.----------------------------------------if ali hazelwood has 1000 haters, i’m one of them. if ali hazelwood has 100 haters, i’m one of them. if ali hazelwood has 50 haters, i’m one of them. if ali hazelwood has 1 hater, i’m me. if ali hazelwood has no haters, it means i am dead. if the world is with ali hazelwood, then i am against the world.other actual thought because i did actually read this…this:• enemies to lovers WHERE? it is never to be seen. not even an ounce of it.• do authors not get second hand embarrassment giving their characters terrible names like misery and lowe??• vampYres instead of vampires is the cherry on top• that cover is giving 2013 wattpad era• i felt no chemistry between the characters. it’s too bad because their friendship and slow burn had potential.• of course he growls, hisses and has a very husky voice• don’t forget he’s So Big. his shoe size is 14, because that is very important and necessary information. his hand is also so big it engulfs her own. he towers over her because He’s Huge. DO NOT FORGET!• obviously he never actually Hated Her, he just had to kinda pretend. she just thinks he does because he can’t stand the smell of her. kinda like when edward was near bella that first time and she thought she reeked? yeah, like that. so she carried this misconception about what he thinks about her but OBVIOUSLY he just, has always liked her. he has been secretly obsessed with her, because when are theynot secretly obsessed but pretend they are not?never.• OF COURSE he’s broody and grumpy and can be mean in the outside but is actually a Big Softie deep down inside. DUH!• misery is quite possibly the most oblivious, useless, boring, weakest, most lame vampire i have ever read about. her being a vampire is actually really irrelevant that you might even forget she’s a vampire. she doesn’t know the difference between a ladle and spatula. ali really likes making her heroines really fucking stupid.• don’t ask me what she looks like because i wouldn’t know. all i know is that she bleeds purple and has pointy ears, which is a weird feature for vampires but whatever. it seems like this author still doesn’t like describing to her readers her characters enough to make them visualizing.• absolutely bland, boring, and very unflavored mmc, just like the rest. he’s a werewolf, has hair that is short and a rich brown cut to a buzz, is the alpha, has broad shoulders…that’s it. anything new? no, obviously. he growls and hisses, but this time he is an artist, i guess, who draws the mc, and takes care of a child.• this was only my third read from this author. i’ve readThe Love HypothesisandLove on the Brain, but i’ve avoided everything published after ‘love on the brain’ because i know i wouldn’t enjoy them. fortunately, i don’t have any desire to read them. i read this because it’s the first paranormal romance by this author, and, for some reason, i thought the genre would mean this would be different. that was not the case for me, obviously. i don’t think i’ll be reading this author again in the futureunless serena and koen get their story cause that ending?? 👀• terrible job of world-building. this author needs to stick to contemporaries. not only does this author not give enough physical descriptions about her characters features but the world building is severely lacking. there is little to no explanation of where and how everything happened. we really just get the basic information necessary. a lot of info dump in the beginning—historical context, names, wars, systems, political diplomatic views, etc. everything piled together.• formulaic, boring, cliché, and immature writing. i can’t even say it’s because this author started off writing fanfiction on ao3 when so many fanfics on ao3 (and even wattpad) are written immensely better than this. so many books published yet this this authors writing hasn’t improved since her debut. i guess when you write a book like the love hypothesis, your quality of books isn’t important anymore because you know your targeted audience will eat up the bare minimum. the characters in this might as well be the same as her previous characters except they’re in a paranormal setting.•if you are excited for this, take my review with a grain of salt as i haven’t enjoyed this author before so just because i didn’t like it, doesn’t mean you won’t.a lot of my friends love this author and her stories. if you haven’t read ali before, you might like it! or, if read her before and have an idea what to expect and don’t care about the formulaic writing, you might enjoy this! for me, the unoriginality, lack of world building, lack of physical characteristics, writing, dialogue, etc., are what made this another disappointing read. if you enjoy this though, good for you!""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '3.75/5I didn\'t expect this book to receive such a high rating from me, but as it turns out, I liked it — I liked it a lot even. I read Ali Hazelwood for the vibes and obsessed heroes, and that\'s exactly what I got, so I\'m satisfied. Satisfied to the point that this book may have become my favorite Ali book. I never thought a book with an arranged marriage between an alpha werewolf and a vampire would become one, but here we are. I guess that\'s what happens when you grow up with Wattpad.Listen. Is Ali the best author with the most gorgeous writing style? No. Does she write almost the same male characters, but with different hairstyles and workplaces? Yes. But does it matter to me? No. Her stories always absorb me from the very beginning to the end to the point where I completely forget about reality, so I simply love them despite their many imperfections.

She definitely won\'t be added to my \'favorite heroines\' folder, but compared to really dumb heroines, she wasn\'t bad.threeThe hero, despite the situation at the end when I wanted to strangle him, yes, I\'m talking about the scene in chapter twenty-five when he left her, claiming that ""it was a mistake"" and ""she shouldn\'t be tied to someone like him"", still stole my heart. I know he wanted her to finally have free will and be able to choose what she wanted in her life, but he could have approached it differently.Still, as I said, I loved him. How could I not love the possessive architect Alpha Werewolf who has an amazing way with children, who would do anything for you and his people, who would draw you, who would remind you that consent is the hottest thing in the world and with whose side you would finally find your family and your place in the world. Yes, I know the part about ""architect Alpha Werewolf"" sounds stupid and like something straight out of a bad Wattpad fanfiction, but I don\'t care.“I would take anything she chose to give me—the tiniest fraction or her entire world. I would take her for a single night knowing that I’ll lose her by morning, and I would hold on to her and never let go. I would take her healthy, or sick, or tired, or angry, or strong, and it would be my fucking privilege. I would take her problems, her gifts, her moods, her passions, her jokes, her body—I would take every last thing, if she chose to give it to me.”fourThe romance was in typical Ali Hazelwood style, meaning a hero who is almost in love with the heroine from the beginning, but for some reason doesn\'t want to admit it, and a heroine who can\'t pick up any hint about it even though it\'s quite obvious. However, this does not change the fact that I ate it up. The smut too, if you know me, you don\'t, but it was kind of hot.fiveThe plot was pretty interesting to me in the beginning, but it lost me towards the end when I stopped caring about the whole werewolf/vampire rivalry and Misery’s friend situation, but I was still intrigued enough to not put the book down once, so I won\'t complain.This was supposed to be a short review, but it didn\'t work out again, but if you are looking for a marriage in convenience romance, found family, werewolves and vamps, a slow-burn with, at least, in my opinion, great tension, don’t be shy and add it to your tbr.————————Vampires and werewolfs?

I applaud Ali Hazelwood for taking a risk out of her comfort zone and writing this paranormal romance. She did not ruin werewolves and vampires for me after all 😌This change of writing and direction was majorly needed and it worked brilliantly. But tbf I had minimal expectations 🤷\u200d♀️✔️ Vampires + werewolves✔️ Marriage of convenience✔️ Slow burnThis one came pretty close to perfection. I liked the plot, characters and romance.The paranormal romance and gothic vibes were really good, the whole environment was quite mesmerizing.Tho I would suggest that please don't go in expecting a world building- it's just romance. It's also quite fast paced and easy to binge. If you are in a reading slump, this is your cure.The characters are fun.Misery and Loweare truly made for each other. I love how they balance each other out. While Misery is unlike misery, in fact quite joyful and a fun vamp to be around. Lowe, on the other hand keeps to himself. I also noticed that Lowe although a werewolf, had a very Edward Cullen like personality. Instead of a typical douche, you are met with someone who actually cares. Misery's sarcasm and sense of humor was fun. Ali Hazelwood thankfully for once did not go over the top with it.The side characters-Ana, Serena and Alex were stand outs. Owen was kinda predictable. It also seems like there's something happening with Serena and Koen? Is there going to be another book? CAUSE I NEED IT!!!The romancewas pretty good. I devoured how Lowe and Misery were into each other. The slow burn was delicious. The spice not so much. Ali, listen to me bestie, in the most gentle way possible, babes, you cannot write smut 😭😭 I know you want to. But please for the love of God, stop writing smut. I wanna give you five stars but I can't until you stop knotting, and opening an Airbnb inside people's vaginas 😭😭On a serious note,one thing that could have been better written was the mate storyline.It did not make sense. One moment Lowe wants her, the next he doesn't, then he does, then he doesn't, and then he does. Yeah, he clearly wanted her so why write it like that?! That deducted a star from me.Overall, it's pretty fun and worth trying.

Misery is the daughter of a powerful vampire politician and she enters a MOC with Lowe, the alpha of a werewolf pack, not just to form an alliance between the two species (who don’t like each other), but also to find out where her missing best friend is.It’s such a fun read and I loved learning about this paranormal world. The romance is classic Ali Hazelwood, just with a PNR twist. Basically, we have a hero who’s secretly pining and growing obsessed with the heroine, and she has no idea.

Ali Hazelwood showed readers how to rock \'n\' roll in a fantasy universe by creating the most intelligent, quirky, nerdy heroine free of stereotypes and clichés. She possesses magical fingers that can sharpen computer skills for coding and breaking into highly secured werewolf territories!Themes of enemies to lovers and forbidden love may initially make us think we\'re in for a Twilight-like romance story. However, I assure you that this complex story offers so much more. Firstly, this book is more than a forbidden romance; it tells the tale of Misery Lark, the only daughter of the most powerful Vampyr councilman in the South, and Lowe Moreland, the most powerful Alpha of the Werewolves. Their marriage aims to bring peace and create an alliance between age-old mortal enemies. There\'s so much happening in the story, including political maneuvering and highly calculated schemes within the territories of werewolves and vampyres. A group of rebels, calling themselves the ""Loyals,"" whose lives have been spared by Lowe, seeks to avenge him by recruiting insiders from their inner circles, blackmailing them into committing treasonous acts.The story is filled with action-packed sequences, intricate world-building, and intercepted mysteries about Lowe\'s family line and Misery\'s inner circle, all of which intrigue readers to learn more. Interestingly, the adventure parts of the book slightly overshadow the romantic aspects. The fantasy world-building and the detailed rules and historical progress among werewolves, vampyres, and humans are depicted intelligently. I expected Ali Hazelwood to excel in the fantasy genre as much as in steamy romance, and I\'m thrilled to say she didn\'t disappoint.Here\'s a summary of the events in this book:After evading several attempts on her life, including bullets, knives, and other lethal weapons orchestrated to kill her, Misery leaves the Vampyre community to live in the human world with her best friend, Serena. She gets a job, wears contact lenses to conceal her irises, hides her fangs, and strives to create a peaceful life. However, her father summons her, proposing a marriage between werewolves and vampyres to establish an alliance during the reign of a new human governor. Misery is too smart not to take the bait, but as soon as she hears the name of the groom-to-be, she accepts the offer without asking for details. Is it a martyr complex, a personal concession, or does she have another agenda for her extremely masculine groom who cannot stand her scent?After the marriage ceremony proceeds without incident, if you discount the usual suicide attempts against Misery (she\'s become accustomed to these life-threatening situations since she was once a forced prisoner for a peace offering, but that\'s another story), Misery finds herself in her secluded mansion, surrounded by werewolves who despise her, searching for a reason to end the forced arrangement. Only six-year-old Anna, Lowe\'s little sister, acts friendly toward her despite her caregivers\' snarky comments about Misery.When Lowe senses the secret that threatens her unwanted marriage, he offers her an alliance to uncover the mysteries that will ultimately benefit them. However, not only their lives but also their hearts are at stake during this very perilous, full-throttle, wild adventure.Lowe is more than a vindictive alpha werewolf facade. He\'s loyal, perceptive, caring, and puts everyone\'s needs first. He\'s the first person to show how much he truly cares about her. Could she learn to trust and lower her emotional barricades to let him in?Overall, this is a smart, riveting, and highly entertaining quirky fantasy romance that I thoroughly enjoyed. I hope there will be more to come, as implied in the epilogue. I wholeheartedly congratulate my favorite steamy romance author for immersing me in a well-executed fantasy world, even though I\'m not a big fan of werewolves (I was never on Team Jacob).Many thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing this amazing book\'s digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest thoughts.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""what started off as promising went downhillquick.╰┈➤ first 1/3 of the book: solid 4 stars 😄╰┈➤ if i had skipped the spice: 3 stars 🙂╰┈➤the book including theknotspice: 2 stars 🥴╰┈➤ the spice alone: 0 stars. negative stars, even. jail.the spice wasknotit.it wasn't even the knot itself that was bad... it washowthe scenes were written. i amslightly?traumatized. i also traumatized my husband when i forced him to read some of the spice. at least i’m not alone in my misery.speaking of Misery...… really? that is, no joke, the name of the fmc. need i say more?i hope i never have to think ofThe Home Depot’sLowe’s strange, lumpy penis ever again.i am moving on now, goodbye. 👋🏻😌""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""This isknotnot your typical Ali Hazelwood butif you are looking for a furr-ociously good time…no, no, that's too corny…mount up and…wait, too suggestive…sink your teeth into…ah hell…Okay soBrideby Ali Hazelwood is going to lend itself to a lot of jokes and I applaud Hazelwood for leaning into them because at its heart this is a fun and rather bitingly funny novel that brings us back into the veins of paranormal romance that dominated the early 2000s. A forced wedding between a vampire and werewolf (a big, beefy, beast of a man-beast) in order to uphold an uneasy truce kick off this story of paranormal politicking and high-energy action paired with a slow-burn romance of an enemies-to-lovers plot (okay it’s not really EtL, it’s more like vaguely-distrustful to lovers) that puts a new meaning to the term “heavy petting” (pawing?). I tend to prefer romance stories that have a larger plot to hold them up, which is what we have here, though admittedly the plot is a bit lackluster and kind of conflates complicating the reveal of the politics and mysteries with actual complexity. Still this is a pretty fun read that highlights a lot of what Hazelwood does best in a very different scenario for her while also making it feel like a natural next step for her stories and I think this is one that if decide to bite in for some fun, you’ll get just that.Oh, have I mentioned the werewolf is huge yet? Big shocker in a Hazelwood book, right? I mean, when I saw werewolf man we all knew this was coming (and so is he…) but guess what? Misery (oh yea, she named her Misery lol) is tall, so I’d like to applaud Hazelwood for some character growth. Oh, wait, sorry, Werewolf Lowe is actually so huge he can’t even fit in their single king-sized bed (if you are playing Romance Tropes drinking game, take a shot for single bed) so you be the judge if its still her big man little woman trope (if yes, take another shot). But it is sort of fun to see a lot of Hazelwood’s signature elements here and I suppose this is the paranormal offshoot of her STEM stories as Misery happens to be a computer genius and that comes in handy (paw-y?) here.There’s a lot going on here and without spoiling much, due to some long feud and a lot of weird truces that tend to involve hostages and interspecieseroticapairings, humans, werewolves and vampires are all poised and ready for bloodshed and this marriage is another stop-gap in that all. Misery now has to live amongst werewolves (they go by Weres which…okay I’ll get to the world building soon but its not the best) who definitely want to kill her but shes so used to ‘feeling alone among people who were never supposed to be my own’ after living with humans all life that she’s gonna give it the old college try! Good for her even if ‘the whole rival-species-bound-by-centuries-of-hostility-until-the-bloody-demise-of-the-weakest-will-put-an-end-to-the-senseless-suffering thing might seem discouraging.’ Theres a slow moving romance as they move from utter distrust to relying on each other and Lowe being pretty damn into her while refusing to admit it and Misery refusing to notice that he’s pretty damn obvious because we need to stretch this already thin plot out with some romantic tension (drink). This is actually fairly light on the romance and the spicier stuff comes later and while this book does lean towards some omegaverse vibes it feels more a nod to all that than actually embracing it. Except knotting (take a shot). Hazelwood fans will enjoy this and they should, though I’m curious if those who might come to this from a deep love or paranormal romance might find it to read like a pop song cover of a deep-cut song they enjoy.This felt fairly undercooked though to me. In part because the world building is mostly done through conversation between Misery and Lowe, which is something I love in theory and found books likeThe Long Way to a Small, Angry Planetto brilliantly execute world building through picking up context in casual conversations between characters, but here the two are distrustful and all coy about revealing things. Its like pulling teeth because thats basically what they are doing to get answers out of each other and I found myself shaking the book screamingjust fucking tell me already(take another shot, not for tropes but in solidarity). Actually, Lowe is kind of annoying at times to be honest, even with his whole “tough alpha” schtick masking that he’s really a sweet sensitive boy packing a donkey sized dick (drink), and his whole “want better than me” thing was eye rolling. But anyways, the bigger catch is…none of the elements feel particularly fresh? And nobody wants a stale body if you are going to suck it’s blood, am i right vampires? A lot of it felt rather cut-and-paste or “spot what this is inspired by” which sometimes made me realize I liked the techniques better in the other books. Theres definitely a BIGUnderworldfilm vibe here, and the whole sucking blood being orgasmic has been done before. I didn’t dislike this book but it made me actually realize I might like Butler’sFledglingmore than I did before. It all works though, I just don’t think fantasy world building is Hazelwood’s greatest strength and a lot of the ambiguities work to ignore that a lot of it feels fairly flimsy.So will these two ‘live bitingly ever after’ or will the politics of their world crush them? It’s worth a read, and I did like the characters quite a bit. I do like Misery asserting herself against and “alpha” and him recognizing her as a strong woman with agency. The plot is pretty fun too with some good twists, and really I have nothing to complain about other than it just didn’t land as well for me as her YA book. It does seem to be both chasing a romantasy trend while also broadening and popularizing it so its sort of a publishing slam dunk and I think a lot of people will rightfully enjoy it. It’s left pretty open for a sequel, I’ll look forward to finding out from your reviews because I think one was more than enough for me.2.5/5""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'yeah, this did KNOT serve ✨️'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'i enjoyed this way too much!!! rtc.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""DNF @ pg 229- I'm out ✌🏾even the characters in the book were not taking the story seriously. how could I?""}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""it's giving jacob black x edward cullen (haven't read it yet tho)""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'brb, running to re-watch twilight + teen wolf 🙃'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4.5⭐️Ali Hazelwood has me in a fucking chokehold, as per usual'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""ARC provided by the publisher via Netgalleyi feel like all my friends who also loved this one, were all by my side here on goodreads, back in the early 2010s, reading all the paranormal romances known to man (or that our moms kept on their bookshelves). the nostalgia for books likeriley jenson,black dagger brotherhood,kate danielswere so very felt. yet, this book completely stands on its own and is a really good book that i highly recommend.and this book had so many of my favorite paranormal romance trope sets - forbidden romance, bonded fated mates, and of course a marriage of convenience between our two main characters:➛misery- vampyre who has been living amongst humans her whole life, but finds herself as the key component in an alliance that will keep the peace with her people, while also having her own human inspired agenda for this forced arrangement.➛lowe- werewolf alpha who is still asserting his new dominance over his people, while also trying to assess who he can trust or not, while also being an amazing caretaker for his little sister.“I would take anything she chose to give me—the tiniest fraction or her entire world.

She knew Sal when she was a child, and he was always so kind to her. How could he possibly have been a killer?Now a senior herself, Pip decides to reexamine the closed case for her final project, at first just to cast doubt on the original investigation.

The BBC series adaptation is announced to be released on Netflix on August 1st! It’s a date! Cannot wait!Applause! Applause! Applause! This book offered one of the quickest and most exhilarating roller coaster experiences the moment I laid my hands on it. I’m still shaky, incoherent (I’ve even requested a translator to articulate my thoughts properly), my nails have seen better days, and I’m both confused and dizzy. But I’m also smiling and filled with happiness! I wholeheartedly give it a perfect five out of five mysterious shining stars!The storytelling is exceptional, the plot keeps you hooked, the character development is fantastic, the pacing is fast and heart-pounding, and the ending is immensely satisfying. What are you waiting for, folks? This book won’t just fall from the sky into your lap. Go ahead, buy it, and send me thank-you letters for my encouraging words!We have an incredible heroine in Pippa (don’t mistake her for Pippi Longstocking). Fitz-Amobi is a talented, smart, nerdy, funny, social, friendly, brave investigator who stands somewhere between Nancy Drew and Veronica Mars, a slightly older version of Harriet Walsh, possessing technical skills but without tattoos, leather, or chains, a more restrained version of Lisbeth Salander, and a younger version of Dana Scully without Mulder and alien conspiracies!The blurb is tempting, intriguing, and immediately pulls you in, making it hard to let go of the book, as I found out. My dogs are even jealous of the book, barking at the moon in protest, but I couldn’t put it down, as it’s one of those books that grabs you from the very first page.Five years ago, Andie Bell went missing, and Sal Singh, who committed suicide after confessing to her murder in a text message, was presumed responsible. Yet Andie’s body was never found. The case was closed, but Pippa is determined to reopen it for her school project. She starts by interviewing Sal’s 20-year-old brother, Ravi, who naturally becomes her partner in crime. Their project evolves into a mission to prove Sal’s innocence and find out who might have really killed Andie.As they dig deeper, Pippa’s list of people of interest grows longer, even including her best friend’s sister.There are numerous burning questions in your mind: Who truly killed Andie? Is Andie really dead? Did she deserve her fate? Because as we learn more about her, we discover she was a bully, a drama queen, a drug dealer, and a blackmailer. Her less-than-stellar attributes made me want to give her a piece of my mind. It’s strange because I’ve never felt the urge to confront a presumed dead person—or someone I’m not even sure is deceased! But this character is a living, breathing (or not) scoundrel!Who framed Sal? Did Sal actually do it? His portrayal as a nice, humble, angelic guy led me to nickname him Castiel, like the angel from ‘Supernatural.’ But we can sense he’s been hiding something. His friends changed their testimonies regarding his whereabouts and the time he left their gathering, refusing to be his alibis. So where was he at the time of the murder?Who was sending threatening messages to Pippa, trying to stop her investigation?I devoured this book, and my detective skills failed me completely until the final pages. The author always stayed ten steps ahead of me! I feel blessed to be outsmarted by her brilliant writing. I can already picture this as an amazing YA mystery movie or a limited Netflix series (anything to replace the third season of ‘13 Reasons Why,’ which might as well be titled ‘13 Reasons Why Did You Even Make a Third Season?’).It was an emotional, enjoyable, nail-biting, mind-bending, thrilling, and ultimately satisfying read. I savored every page, every clue, and every heart-pounding moment of this book. I highly recommend it! It’s even better than ‘One of Us Is Lying.’And the best news is there are three more sequels to look forward to! I’ve already started my excitement dance, which is a blend of Beyoncé’s ‘All the Single Ladies’ moves and John Travolta’s ‘Staying Alive’ grooves.

I am stoked by how much I loved this!!For her Senior Capstone Project, Pippa Fitz-Amboi, an extraordinarily-focused high school girl, decides to solve a murder.Andie Bell, disappeared five years ago from Pippa's hometown; foul play was suspected.The police, and thus everyone else, believe Andie was murdered by her boyfriend at the time, Sal Singh, who subsequently disposed of the body.Their biggest piece of evidence, a purported confession Sal texted his parents, days after Andie disappeared. This confession was sent just prior to Sal's death, an apparent suicide.In spite of this, Pippa does not believe in Sal's guilt. Andie's body was never recovered and there is no real physical evidence linking him to her disappearance.Pippa is such a great character. She's an overachiever, who works tirelessly towards achieving her goals.You can tell, once she sets her sights on something, she will not give up and that's exactly how she tackles her Senior project.I think one of the things that connected me so much to this story was Pippa. I found her super relatable and loved reading from her perspective.She ends up befriending Sal's younger brother, Ravi. That additional commitment to him, and clearing Sal's name, makes Pippa even more steadfast; in spite of very real danger.Additionally, the format of this was creative and engaging. The use of mixed media sources, including the transcripts for the interviews from Pippa's investigation, and a present day narrative, made me feel like I was a part of the action.As Pippa is evaluating what she has learned along the way, she recaps things, as you actually would if you were working on this type of project; including a running list of current suspects tracked on her murder-board.The stakes were high and there were times Pippa was legitimately in very real danger. Through it all, she stayed true to herself and fought for justice for Andie and Sal.I loved this so much, as I said. I could go on for many more paragraphs of all the positive attributes of this story, but don't just take my word for it, PICK THIS UP!!!If you love it even half as much as I did, you're in for a good time! Well done by Holly Jackson. I am so excited to get more mysteries from her!!!""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '""Who do you think I am, an amateur?""Move aside, Nancy Drew! There\'s a new teen detective in town. And she won\'t rest until she\'s unearthed all your secrets and gotten to the bottom of a mystery that has long held her town captive.Pip never truly believed what all of Fairview has accepted: that Sal Singh murdered his beautiful and popular girlfriend Andie Bell and then killed himself. Five years later, Pip is a senior in high school, and decides for her final project that she\'s going to find out once and for all what really happened that night.I\'m always in the mood for a good whodunnit. Give me a small group of suspects, everyone hiding secrets, more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at, and red herrings galore, and I\'m in heaven. I loved putting on my detective cap and puzzling out the clues alongside Pip as she investigates and solves this mystery.For me, in order for a mystery to be successful, it has to be so riveting that there is no room for me to think. Once my mind gets going, it has this annoying habit of supplying me with random unsolicited guesses, some of which inevitably turn out to be right, and ruining the surprises. So it\'s best if I\'m so taken with the story that I\'m only surfacing to turn the pages as fast as I can. And this story was exactly that.I grew up on Nancy Drew, and have been looking for an older version of that for as long as I\'ve outgrown it. And how wonderful that this story turned out to be all that I\'ve been looking for and more. Pip is clever, spunky, and fearless, the perfect teen detective staring down secrets and murderers.

This book had it all - bad writing, a completely unrealistic plot, white savior trope, ""I\'m not like other girls"", and probably the most annoying main character I have ever read about.For some reason, this teenager is allowed to start a massive murder investigation, where every possible witness tells her everything without her having to work for it, and - of course - she ends up doing what the police couldn\'t. The whole premise was just so unrealistic and unbelievable that I was annoyed from the very first page.The mystery itself was also barely a mystery at all, the pacing was off, things made no sense and everything was terribly convenient. Pip kept making random decisions and suspect basically everyone until she finally guessed the right person. At that point in the book, I was just counting down how many pages I still had to suffer through.Pip had no personality traits aside from her constant need to save everyone because she was such a good person and better than everyone else, which the reader was reminded of every second page. It\'s never explained why any of these people talk to Pip and basically tell her their entire life stories, or even why she cares enough to launch this entire investigation. Her character has no development and at the end of the novel, she\'s still exactly as annoying as she was on the very first page.I wish I hadn\'t read this, it clearly wasn\'t for me and a massive waste of time.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""can i sit at the cool kids table?i enjoyed a popular book. i think i'm well past due my invite at this point.this is a fun book that is sometimes really repetitive and sometimes really boring and only has half of a satisfying ending, and yet it's still a quick read.that is literally all i expect or desire from a popular YA mystery.bottom line: i'm going to read every book in this series until i ruin it for myself <3""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""This was good but just good.I think I'm getting too old to suspend my disbelief.

I cannot resist a good mystery, and am always on the hunt for the next ""it"" book in the genre. I\'m a busy mom of two, so it is rare for me to find a book so special that I can finish it in two sittings, but that\'s exactly what I found withA Good Girl\'s Guide to Murder.Pippa Fitz-Amobi is a true crime loving teen who aspires to become a top-notch journalist one day. So naturally, she decides to focus her senior capstone project on her small town\'s most buzz-worthy, unsolved crime: the murder of Andie Bell. What begins as a simple proposal quickly turns into an in-depth investigation full of unexpected twists and turns. After teaming up with the alleged murderer\'s brother, the pair spiral into a web of danger and obsession, and quickly wonder if they\'ve gotten themselves in too deep.This debut reads as if you are investigating alongside the main characters, and fans of true crime podcasts will rejoice in the multimedia formatting that so wittily engages the reader from beginning to end.

Here me out I got my reasons 🫣So I had a lot of fun reading it, the mystery surrounding Angie and Sal was really awesome. Pip and Ravi are likable characters and with intriguing personalities. The amount of work Pip put in to unravel the mystery was commendable and it's all for a school project 😅It's awell written and extremely well thought out book,no doubt, so kudos to the author there. Also the way she exposed racism via characters like Stanley is something I really liked. Let's be honest, people like him still exist. That was the only part in the book where the author was realistic...Cmon you expect me to believe a school girl solved this murder case when the big guys police, detectives can't do shit. I get there can be some sort of corruption involved in cases but no way a school kid is solving a murder that complicated without the consistent assistance of someone with experience. I don't care how intelligent Pip was, it's justextremely unrealistic.Also, it was kind of a bummer that Ravi didn't get that much of time in the book. I wanted to see him involved more often.Don't even get me started on the dog. Thelast 100 pages were really wild.So much happened, so many exposed and new questions arising. Am keen on starting with the next book already.It's definitely worth checking out but it's not anything special. Maybe the expectations got to me but I would suggest to anyone who reads this for the first time- go in with lowered expectations. I personally believe thatFive Survivewas the better book.~•~•~Y'all..

Evidently, I should not expect plausibility, believability, character development or strong motivations in these books, like I do when reading adult mysteries. No wonder there is only ONE teen mystery that I think is good, and actual teens don't even like reading it, from what I hear. (It'sSadiein case you were wondering).A Good Girl's Guide to Murderstarts off as a Serial rip-off, with upstanding Pippa swooping in Sarah Koenig-like to clear the name of a poor brown guy accused of the murder of a popular girl whose body remains missing. You see, it's only Pippa who believes in Sal's innocence, and she will save the day, because she is a GOOD GIRL and Sal was once nice to her years ago! I was already annoyed at that point.However, from there this story devolves into a sleuthing adventure where Pippa manages to have every Tom, Dick and Harry confess all their misdoings to her, because PIPPA IS WRITING A SCHOOL PAPER ABOUT THE MURDER. She catphishes people, breaks into houses, blackmails drug dealers, discovers 5-year old evidence in plain view, because she is just so much better than the police at everything. I can understand why police wouldn't care to pursue a case of aWho Drew The D!cks or The Turd Bulrglarvariety, but a suicide and a presumed murder? And the victim is still missing and nobody but Pippa cares? Have you heard of Natalie Halloway? She disappeared 15 years ago, and she is still on TV. The whole investigation was one giant eyeroll for me.Anyway, to put it short, this book has nothing that I look for in a mystery.

Those lies were allowed.”I LOVE THIS SERIES SO MUCH 🫶I had the sudden urge to reread this series after reading a different murder mystery book and realizing that I am so good at reading those types of books quickly, so I was hoping and praying that they would get me out of my terrible reading slump, and since I just reread this entire series, I\'m really hoping it worked 😭🤞This is also such a good series to reread if you first read it a long time ago, because going into this I remembered nothing except for the basics and who the murderer was, but it was almost like reading it for the first time all over again which is such a good experience.∘◦ ✂ ————–✂ ◦∘The PlotAll of Holly Jackson\'s books have wild plots 😭 even in this reread I was gasping and feeling so confused and then almost crying.Murder mysteries always have a way of making me super stressed or tense or nervous but this trilogy is something else when it comes to that, there\'s just this certain undertone to them that make me so wrapped into the story-line that I forget about the real world and literally everything spooks me 😭I love that this book isn\'t super predictable. During my first read I was so confused, but I had so many guesses as to who the murderer was, or who any other suspects for any of the other small plot-lines were, but I never guessed who it was, which is always a good feeling. Though I get a good feeling when I get it right too, so either way, it\'d have been great 🤪Still never getting past acertainevent in this book.Thatscene has always stuck with me 😒“Pip wished she was strong enough, but she’d learned that she wasn’t invincible; she too could break.”∘◦ ✂ ————–✂ ◦∘The CharactersI know that we only really begin to see it in this book but Pip is an actual like psychotic genius or something. She is so smart and such a good detective, and she can solve mysteries in the amount of time that it would take for me to even start collecting the clues. Excluding that, she is also just such a relatable character, like if you disregard the fact that she solves murders and stuff then she\'s just a normal, relatable teenage girl! 🤷\u200d♀🤷\u200d♀ way better than me though, I wish I was more like Pip (only in this one though) she\'s also like crazy brave, I would not be able to do ANY of the things she did.Ravi is my KING. I\'ve always loved him, he\'s just so adorable and friendly and EVERYTHING. He\'s so loyal and seeing him try so hard to prove his brother\'s innocence is just so amazing, just showcasing his determination and passion. I also ADORE the fact that he\'s not afraid to show his emotions; like I\'ve read a lot of books about stone-cold guys who don\'t show emotions, like their grumpy and blah blah blah but Ravi is definitely not the grumpy one, I\'d say Pip is more of the grumpy one if that\'s the case, but Ravi tries hard to be sunshine and rainbows and I love it 👑🫅FUCK MAX HASTINGSI love Pip\'s friends (except for two people), they\'re just so fun and have a wide range of personalities 😃Yeah I didn\'t really care for them much, except I did really love Cara.“They were each other’s crutch to lean on when life got too much to carry alone.”∘◦ ✂ ————–✂ ◦∘The RelationshipsNow, there wasn\'t really much of a romance but it\'s kindaquiteobvious where one ""friendship"" is headed, so you\'ve been warned if you don\'t wanna see.I loved Pip\'s relationship with her family, it felt real and authentic, and they were all so cute, as well as her friendships, they were all just so loyal.All of those are insignificant in comparison to Team Pip and Ravi, my dream team. They mesh so well together that it\'s actually insane. They are the ONLY romance I have ever accepted in murder mysteries, which is saying a lot because I actually despise despise despise romances in murder mysteries, so these two are waaay up on a pedestal that even I can\'t reach right now.Also, the nickname Sarge is the cutest thing ever.“We’re a team, remember. You and me.”AH∘◦ ✂ ————–✂ ◦∘Overall, this was probably the last time I can ever read this book ""for the first time"" because I usually remember everything after the second read, which is unfortunate, but whateverI LOVE THIS SERIES SO MUCH5 stars(note: and if this stupid show isn\'t available in the US I\'m gonna scream my head off.)“Maybe laughter was one of the very first things you lost after something like that.”<><><><><><><>rereadeither Pip is some sort of genius or the cops in that town are actual idiots. i think it\'s bothanyways i\'m on a roll, two books in one week is great for someone who hasn\'t read since december AND i read this in 2 daysrtc 😜<><><><><><><>Y\'ALL I HEARD THEY\'RE MAKING A SHOW OUT OF THIS, THIS BETTER NOT BE A JOKE AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I NEED PIP AND RAVI HELP<><><><><><><>Holy cow, I did not expect that ending.

And it\'s also one of the first I\'ve read entirely in English, and as you know that Spanish is my native language, I assume you\'ll know that it was a bit complex. Although, I\'m adapting a bit more to reading in English. Wish me luck, folks.In A Good Girl\'s Guide to Murder we follow Pippa Fitz-Amobi, a 17-year-old student whose final year project is the case of Andie Bell, who was murdered by her boyfriend, Sal Singh and taken for granted by the police. But Pippa knows Sal is innocent, so she decides to find out what happened five years ago and whoreally killedAndie Bell.Pippa discovers that Andie had many secrets, that she was not the beautiful and tragic victim that the people of Little Kilton martyred and idolised, branding Sal Singh a murderer and a monster, treating his family very badly for it. In addition, Little Kilton holds even more secrets that intrigue Pip and make her want to keep digging to solve the mystery.Writing.I don\'t think I remember reading a book like this, with diary-like entries speaking in first person and then in third person. It was a bit strange, if I\'m honest, and it took me a bit longer to adjust. However, it was an easy read in some respects. And, I don\'t know if it\'s because of the difference between British and American English, but there were phrases that I had to look up because I didn\'t understand them, lmao.Plot.The plot kept me glued in my seat, not wanting to put my phone down, wanting to know what would happen next. I mention that I was late with this book because college is eating me alive, though I made time to keep reading because I was consumed with thoughts of not knowing what would happen, who the killer would be and if Pip was going to find out. There are a lot of plot twists that I wasn\'t expecting and a lot of things that made my brain almost melt from thinking about it so much.Pacing.It was a quick and light read, and I take back that I was late because of college: I would have finished it sooner if it weren\'t for homework. It\'s not that complicated to understand and the pages turn very quickly.Characters.Pip is a good girl, addicted to homework and determined to solve the Andie Bell case and prove that Sal Singh is innocent at all costs. So eager is she to find out what really happened, that she finds herself lying to others so that they won\'t worry about her and try to stop her from abandoning her project.Ravi is the younger brother of Sal Singh. He has been the target of criticism, and is known as the brother of Andie Bell\'s killer. Ravi knows his brother is innocent, and when Pip shows up at his door asking him a few questions, he thinks it\'s a joke. And soon, Ravi becomes Pip\'s partner in crime, both looking for answers about his brother\'s sudden death and his innocence in the case. Ravi is a beautiful little baby, don\'t touch him I want to take care of him.Also, Ravi: marry me.Andie was a bitch and it doesn\'t surprise me much that bad things happened to her. Everyone held her in such high regard, believing she was a good girl whose boyfriend murdered her. Andie ruined several people\'s lives, and although I thought I would feel bad that she had died, I didn\'t really. When you find out the truth about Andie Bell, what she did and didn\'t do, you don\'t feel any empathy for her.Cara is Pip\'s best friend, her older sister is Naomi, who was in turn Sal\'s best friend and who also keeps a big secret that makes Pip dig very closely into her and her life, including her family.(Bonus and unnecessary fact:Cara translates from Spanish to English as: \'face\' and \'expensive\'.Unnecessary examples:Sucaraes hermosa= her face is beautiful. La camisa escara= the shirt is expensive.) Follow me for more unnecessary Spanish classes, they are free of charge.Pip\'s family is ok. They\'re the typical caring and normal family. Tho I loved Vic\'s jokes, jsjsjs he laughing at his own jokes (just as Ravi) is totally me.Max Hastings can die and I wouldn\'t care for him. He deserves the shit going on in his life. He\'s a dick and you can easily see it. Please, go fuck yourself, you fucking bastard. 🥰🥰🥰⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️oK, PEOPLE, SPOILER SECTION. YOU\'VE BEEN WARNED.⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️Tho I loved this book, I really enjoyed and liked it a lot, there were many ??? things that left me with a bitter taste on my mouth.First of all, Pip felt a little bit dry and typical. She\'s a good girl who starts to lie for her project and she doesn\'t feel the same anymore. I mean, idk, I can\'t put it into words, I just hope she felt morerealand not flat.Second, how quick all of the possible suspects told Pip the truth, when they lied to the police or omitted information. I found it quite unbelievable and a little bit ilogic. Also, Mr. Ward confessed really quick and it felt dry... I don\'t quite know how to explain it, but I was expecting more. Becca Bell also confessed really quick, and spilled her secrets out as she were talking about the weather, which also felt a little bit bitter.aND THE FINAL STRAW: BARNEY. NO. NO. NO.

Ustedes saben que llevo tiempo interesada en leer thrillers y este me lo habían recomendado un montón, luego vi las reseñas y terminé por convencerme, ¡no me arrepiento!Pippa, la protagonista, es un ser fácil de querer, jajaja. Sí siento que a veces era demasiado impulsiva y no medía las consecuencias de sus actos, pero aún así solo quería que todo le saliera bien. No sé, como protagonista me pareció dinámica y divertida y carismática, en ningún momento me cansé de seguirla en su investigación :). DIGO, sí llegué a pensar que estaba llevando las cosas muy lejos, pero se me hizo un personaje tan bien construido, que sus acciones tenían sentido (tipo de: ""¡eso es tan Pippa!"").AWWW, además no me esperaba al interés amoroso y, aunque la historia no se centra para nada en el romance, se me hizo una parejita súper bonita AND I WAS ROOTING FOR THEM.El elemento principal de la historia es el misterio y está súper bien llevado. El libro te atrapa desde el primer momento y es imposible de soltar. Además, a mí me pareció poco predecible. Teníamos a varios sospechosos y TODOS PODÍAN SER CULPABLES. Todos tenían sus razones muy fuertes. ¿Y adivinen qué? Obviamente no le atiné, jajajaja.Eso sí, no sé si continuar con la trilogía porque creo que este libro terminó muy bien así.

No es que hubiera leído muchas reseñas positivas ni nada por el estilo, perome daba esa sensación misteriosa que algunos libros te dan y sabes que necesitas leerlo y que te va a gustar.Sabéis a lo que me refiero, ¿no?EnAsesinato para principiantestenemos una trama que sinceramente me ha sorprendido muy positivamente.Losthrillersjuveniles de este estilo, a lo Natasha Preston o incluso Sara Shepard, suelen quedarse a veces un poco en la superficie de todo. Bueno, quizá no es la superficie, pero sí queme suele faltar un poco que me construyan mejor todo. Y es que Holly Jackson no escatima en detalles.A ver,el libro te agarra desde el primer momento.Yo normalmente leo el primer capítulo de un libro para decidir si va a ser mi próxima lectura o no, y en este caso es que llevaba página y media y dije pOR DIOS, SÍ, ESTO TIENE QUE SER MÍO.El estilo de la autora hace que te introduzcas de lleno en la historia, y lo mejor de todo, es que no es solo unthriller.Para que un libro de estas características funcione, o por lo menos para mí es esencial, tiene que tener una buena protagonista con la que conecte, entienda y quiera luchar por ella. Pip es así.La construcción del personaje no es algo accesorio, al contrario. Holly Jackson se centra bastante en tener una protagonista muy definida, conociendo detalles de su vida privada, relaciones con amigos y demás.No hace que el ritmo del libro bajey no hace tampoco que te impacientes para descubrir qué está pasando en el pueblo. La manera en la que Jackson maneja el espacio entre escenas me ha gustado mucho.No es muy normal para mí ponerle 5 estrellas a un libro de este género. No sé por qué, la verdad, peropuedo recordar pocas ocasiones donde unthrillerme haya volado la cabeza tantísimo.Pero es que enAsesinato para principiantestenemosuna historia que está perfectamente hilada, que se desarrolla lentamente pero con decenas de giros, y que te atrapa cada vez más porque se va convirtiendo en una locura cada vez más increíble.De hecho, le han visto el increíble potencial que tiene y los derechos audiovisuales han sido comprados. Esperemos que la cosa fluya y tengamos a Pippa y Ravi en la gran (o pequeña) pantalla, porque de verdad,este libro es increíble.Tenemos toda la trama de misterio, sobre qué pasó con Addie Bell y Sal Singh, cuyas averiguaciones van poniéndote los pelos de punta cada vez más.Los métodos para descubrir mentiras o verdades a medias de Pip son de aplaudir, porque es una chica muy inteligente y que no le tiene miedo a nada: tan solo persigue la verdad y la justicia.Una de mis cosas favoritas del libro es lowokeque es la autora.Pippa tiene un padrastro -al que llama padre- de origen nigeriano, su nuevo mejor amigo es indio y una de sus amigas es lesbiana. Y dirás: “¡pero la protagonista sigue siendo blanca! ¡Es una privilegiada!” Y así es. Y, de hecho, es tan así que hasta ella misma lo dice.Hay situaciones de racismo en el libro en las que Pippa habla sobre tener privilegios por ser blanca, sobre cómo puede tener actitudes racistas pese a haberse criado con un padre negro…Me ha encantado que en un libro de misterio aparentemente solo de eso, se debatan o comenten este tipo de temas sociales.También se habla de machismo, abusos sexuales…En general, es un libro con temas de actualidad, y quizá la excusa para tratarlos es el misterio. (Aunque tampoco es que la crítica sea una pieza central, no nos confundamos.)Sin embargo,con lo que más me quedo deAsesinato para principianteses con la pedazo de trama de Holly Jackson y cómo está organizada.

But Pippa Fitz-Amobi thinks that Sal is not the killer. She chooses this case as the topic for her final year, Senior Capstone Project. She is trying to find the mystery behind Andie Bell\'s case. Was Sal the real killer? If not, is Pippa\'s life in danger? Will the killer try to hurt Pippa so that she won\'t be able to solve the case? Holly Jackson will answer all these questions through this book.What I learned from this book1) What is hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia?This is an interesting new word I learned from this book. Its meaning is fear of long words.“Pip knew a great many things; she knew thathippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobiawas the technical term for the fear of long words.”2) What happens to all the missing people?The author shares some interesting statistics related to the missing people in this book. This will help us to know what actually happens to the missing people.“I found these statistics: 80% of missing people are found in the first twenty-four hours. 97% are found in the first week, and 99% of cases are resolved in the first year. That leaves just 1%. 1% of people who disappear are never found. And just 0.25% of all missing persons cases have a fatal outcome.""3) What is toxic productivity, and how can it hurt our life?Few of my friends and patients are obsessed with watching productivity videos on YouTube. Productivity is always good in our life. But when it reaches such a level that we always try to be productive in all areas of life, it might reach toxic levels. Are the online productivity gurus hurting people\'s lives instead of helping them? This serious question can only be answered after more profound research and understanding.The author indirectly mentions toxic productivity in a couple of areas in this book.“What\'s wrong with me? ... I might seem like the ideal student: homework always in early, every extra credit and extracurricular I can get my hands on, the good girl and the high achiever. But I realized something just now: it\'s not ambition, not entirely. It\'s fear. Because I don\'t know who I am when I\'m not working, when I\'m not focused on or totally consumed by a task. Who am I between the projects and the assignments, when there\'s nothing to do? I haven\'t found her yet and it scares me.""“Your efficiency offends me.”My favourite three lines from this book“Half less of a bad thing meant there was room for half good.”“The people you love weren’t algebra: to be calculated, subtracted, or held at arm’s length across a decimal point.”""But sometimes remembering isn\'t for yourself, sometimes you do it just to make someone else smile. Those lies were allowed.""What could have been better?If you are someone who attended Med School, you will know how some patients try to avoid Med School students saying that they are not Doctors even after knowing they will be Doctors in a couple of years.If we look at the world from the angle of the people I mentioned above, it will be difficult to believe that a teenager is going for an important murder investigation like this, and almost every person connected to it treating her like a real grown-up police officer/ detective and fully cooperating with her and telling her everything they know. It, in fact, looks totally unrealistic from any practical human being\'s point of view.Rating3.5/5This is a real page-turner with many twists that will satisfy most of the readers.—————————————————————————You can also follow me onInstagram ID - Dasfill|YouTube Channel ID - Dasfill|YouTube Health Channel ID - Dasfill - Health|YouTube Malayalam Channel ID - Dasfill - Malayalam|Threads ID - Dasfill|Twitter ID - Dasfill1|Snapchat ID - Dasfill|Facebook ID - Dasfill|TikTok ID - Dasfill1'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""3.5/5 ✧･ﾟi have finally finished this and i'm not sure entirely how i feel - i think i'm going to give it 3.5 stars for now? i definitely enjoyed it, but the ending was a little... i don't know maybe i wasn't following as closely as i should of? 𓍢ִ໋🌷͙֒︶︶︶ ⊹ ︶︶︶⠀୨♡୧⠀︶︶︶ ⊹ ︶︶︶╰┈➤Plot:This was overall enjoyable, it was YA so I didn't feel a gripe in my stomach (but I did in Five Survive). The stakes didn't feel that high - this is for sure more murder mystery than thriller. It was very addicting though and did not see the first big plot twist coming at all. A lot of the points Pip (the main character) though 'oh that's suspicious!' - I think a normal person wouldn't have thought that and all. I get that's the point of her character, she 'overthinks', finds leads and chases them down like a bloodhound. To me, whilst this book discusses some really important topics, I didn't find it thrilling.I also didn't guess who did it, but I was hoping Sal would have a bigger part to play, considering how him and Andie's relationship is pictured?.I know I've just trashed on the plot so you might be wondering why it's still such a high rating -╰┈➤Characters:All the characters were loveable.Pipis your typical quirky and super intelligent female YA MC.

I could kind of picture the different places she was talking about, the places of interest - it wasn't particularly like amazing or adding a sense of dread.

However, I did enjoy this book a lot. To me it felt like a fun detective story, I wasn't trying to solve anything because too much information was being thrown my way.

The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo
",Taylor Jenkins Reid,4.41,3431571,2362,"Fiction, Historical Fiction, LGBT, Contemporary, Audiobook, Queer, Historical",389,13-06-2017,"Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband has left her, and her professional life is going nowhere. Regardless of why Evelyn has selected her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.Summoned to Evelyn’s luxurious apartment, Monique listens in fascination as the actress tells her story. From making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the ‘80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way, Evelyn unspools a tale of ruthless ambition, unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love. Monique begins to feel a very real connection to the legendary star, but as Evelyn’s story nears its conclusion, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.","[{'rating': 5, 'content': '5/5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth.

This book is spectacular. This book is outstanding. I have nothing negative to say about this book. It\'s a pure 5 star for me. I\'m irrevocably astonished and astounded.

AFTER THIS LINE I HAD TO FINISH THIS BOOK.And I decided I would finish it. I would read more than 150 pages and finish it. So I went to my obligation the next day with 4 hours of sleep but I was happy about it. Because I knew I couldn\'t survive a whole day without finishing this book. I would die. This is the impact this book has had on me. Now, let\'s talk specifics.Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one in the journalism community is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband, David, has left her, and her career has stagnated. Regardless of why Evelyn has chosen her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.Summoned to Evelyn’s Upper East Side apartment, Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late 80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way. As Evelyn’s life unfolds through the decades—revealing a ruthless ambition, an unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love—Monique begins to feel a very a real connection to the actress. But as Evelyn’s story catches up with the present, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.Historical fiction is my favorite genre of all time. I love it in every form, books, tv shows, movies. But not this kind of historical fiction, theOutlanderandRoss Poldarkkind of historical fiction. The older one, you could say. Also, historical fiction about wars and stuff, which is more recent. But I have never read something about the Old Hollywood. I have only watched movies and tv shows about it. So this was new territory for me.I will admit, it took me about 150 pages to get fully immersed into the story. Up until that point, the book was a 4 star for me. Which is still amazing, but I didn\'t quite understand the hype till that point. A little after Evelyn divulges her secret love, and basically everything starts, my wig is totally snatched. I\'m into the book 100%, ready to knowEVERYTHINGaboutEVERYTHING. The pace was so incredibly fast, there was not a moment I felt my eyes close. The writing was impeccable, some narrations of scenes kept my heart racing. There weren\'t any redundant descriptions of places or rooms, there were descriptions of faces and clothes which kept me enthralled into to the story. The author did an amazing research, it was obvious that she knew her shit, everything was on point. The story kept me on my toes each time with its smart maneuvers, the schemes, the plans, everything the main characters did, all the choices they made, to dodge unfortunate situations. Everything was just... on point. I have nothing bad to say. This never happens. This book was just too perfect. I want to cry because, if not for the hype, I wouldn\'t have picked up this book. And I would have lost such an amazing journey, such an important book. Thank you all for loving this book and making me love it too.Evelyn. Evelyn Hugo is the most flawlessly written character I have ever witnessed. No, wrong. She isn\'t a character to me. She is a person. With influences fromMerilyn MonroeandElizabeth Taylor, the author made Evelyn Hugo her own star. Every time I would read about a scene from one of the movies, I was like ""Oh, I will watch that movie next."", and then I remembered that she doesn\'t actually exist. Which made me sad, because all of the content of this book was so interesting. I felt like I was reading an actual autobiography from a real legendary actress. It was incredible. Evelyn is such a good written character, a good written character, not a good person. She is raw, devious, manipulative, scheming, cold-hearted. She is basically a bitch. But you can\'t help but to want to know everything about her. You want to slap the shit out of her one moment and then hug her the next. She is sensual, enticing, seductive. She always knows what to say to make you believe in her cause. She uses her greatest assets to her benefit, and she isn\'t ashamed about it. She doesn\'t give a fuck. She wants to climb the ladder and she will do anything to achieve her goal. Even marry seven men who will serve her purpose. And she does it. With her scandalous life and her improved acting skills and beneficial movie choices, she climbs to the top. But we also see her sensitive side, her human side. We see her deep friendship with Harry, another remarkable character. We see her love for her child. We see her devotion to Celia. We see her as a human too, with real emotions. And I find that marvelous. I wish all characters in books had so much depth, so much meaning. And not the John Green kind of pretentious deep meaning. The real one.Monique. An underdeveloped character, in my opinion. I didn\'t care that much about her, but her story was gripping. To be honest, Evelyn didn\'t let me care a lot about any other character. She took my attention all to herself. Which is what she did with the entire world. But anyway. An unknown journalist requested to write one of the most popular actresses\' biography. A 35 year old woman, who feels like she hasn\'t achieved much so far in her life. She has a ruined marriage, an under prestigious job, she has been under appreciated all her life, even though she possesses many skills. She is also a POC, and she is mislabeled literally every day. I needed more of her character, I needed to see more of her. But after Evelyn\'s story started, we didn\'t get much of her. But I\'m so happy that she stood up to herself and her self love grew. That Evelyn showed her the way, and she got out of a meaningless marriage, she made deals regarding her job, her future, she stood on her own two feet. I\'m really proud of her.THE REPRESENTATION. THIS BOOK HAD THE BEST REPRESENTATION I HAVE EVER SEEN. Suck it all of you who keep saying a historian fiction can\'t entail good representation.IN YOUR FACES. We have two main interracial characters. One bisexual character, one lesbian character and one gay character. And these are just the main character. We also got side representation, from not as important characters in the story. This factor upped the story so much to me. We got to see the struggles that POV and gay people used to face in a time like this. We got to see our main character hide her true lineage to rise at the top of Hollywood. We got to see two lovers hiding their true sexuality, hiding their undying love for each other because the world would never understand. The conversations between the characters about homophobia of that time period were heartbreaking. I saw so much of our own time in them. So many things have changed since then in our world, and so many have not. We can see the comparisons from these types of books. And it\'s a reminder of how our society is moving forward of backwards. The representation made this book what it is. If every single character was white and straight, I wouldn\'t have been as awed by this book as I am now. And I am myself, a while straight female. Imagine how important representation is for people who can actually relate to it. I would never understand.This book had so many layers. Everything was thought of and processed. Nothing was sloppy, nothing was lacking meaning. Every single word had its reason to be written. I feel privileged to have had the honor of reading this book. It will stick to me for a very long time. I also enjoyed the little snippets we got from the newspapers. They made the setting all the much more real. The relationships were everything, the friendships, the love stories. Evelyn\'s life is so engaging and complicated, you can\'t get enough of it. We truly see how corrupt the Old Hollywood was. And it makes us think about the New Hollywood. Is it still like this? Is everything we see just a fabricated lie? All the lies the characters came up with, seemed to work. I guess, we can never know what happens between closed doors. But I think the New Hollywood is more sincere. It\'s more about talent, at the most part. I\'d like to hope so.In conclusion, I could rave about this book for days. I have so much to say, I could write a book myself. But I\'m gonna end it here. This book was a present sent to me by God himself. I want to read it again and again and again and absorb its wisdom. This book would be such an amazing source material for a movie adaptation.WE NEED THIS TO HAPPEN. But I\'m scared they would ruin it. I\'m always scared with book to movie adaptations. We all readers are. Anyway, I couldn\'t recommend this enough. It doesn\'t matter if you don\'t read historical fiction or adult,PICK THIS BOOK UP. You won\'t regret it one bit. So, till the next one... K BYE!!!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '”Evelyn always leaves you hoping you’ll get just a little bit more. And she always denies you.”This book was so, so, soGOOD!!I swear I was barely two pages in and already knew that I’d love it with all my heart! <3 There’s just something about that golden Hollywood era that captivated me right from the beginning and once Evelyn entered the scene I was a goner. I just loved the way her story was told!We didn’t only get the interviews with Monique but also were able to read news articles about her life and this made everything so much more intriguing. I mean “Hollywood Digest”, “Sub Rosa” or the “New York Tribune”, they all wrote about Evelyn’s life and those articles give an authenticity that makes this book feel real. It could have happened, Evelyn could have been a real Hollywood Star and people could have been as fascinated by her as by Marilyn Monroe or Marlene Dietrich.I think to some degree Taylor Jenkins Reid might have even had Marilyn Monroe in her mind when she wrote Evelyn’s character and knowing how awesome Marilyn was this really doesn’t come as a surprise. XD Another thing I appreciated was that every husband got a part of this book and even though there were seven of them, who all influenced Evelyn and left a mark on her character, none of them actually was her one true love. It’s a very particular approach to a great story and I loved the way it was carried out.Still, after I read the ending my mind was reeling and my feelings were so mixed that I had a tough time coming to terms with everything that was revealed. There were so many things I felt conflicted about and even now, after more than a week has passed, I still didn’t manage to sort out my feelings and I still don’t know what to do with them. Maybe I’ll have to get used to the idea that to think about Evelyn Hugo and her seven husbands will always make me feel conflicted and that there’s no such thing as making peace with an ending like that.And maybe, just maybe, that was Taylor Jenkins Reid’s plan all along. ;-)The characters:Welcome to my characters section, aka “The spoilery spoiler zone”! If you didn’t read the book yet and still want to be surprised by its revelations you better don’t continue to read my review. I’m worse than any tabloid mentioned in this book and I’ll spoil you relentlessly! If you still want to read my gossip, go ahead, but don’t say I didn’t warn you! ;-PEvelyn Hugo:”And I didn’t say I was confessing any sins. To say that what I have to tell is a sin is misleading and hurtful. I don’t feel regret for the things I’ve done – at least, not the things you might expect – despite how hard they may have been or how repugnant they may seem in the cold light of day.”Oh, Evelyn! Where do I even begin? I loved that woman so damn much, I can’t even! <333 It’s so rare to meet such a complex character in a book but damn Evelyn just had it all! She was neither white nor black, and if anything she was all different shades of grey. I loved that she was so ruthless, that she did what she had to do in order to get what she wanted, that she was unapologetic about her decisions and behaviour and that she never held back and just wanted it all! Celia was right, at times Evelyn could be really awful and egoistic, but damn did her good qualities make up for it. Compassionate, caring and protective of the ones she loved she would have done everything possible to keep them safe and happy. Gosh,WHAT. A. WOMAN!I think I might be in love with her! <333”Did I want to make as much money as Don? Of course I did. I wanted to get the paycheck and mail a copy of it to him with a photo of my middle finger. But mostly I wanted the freedom to do whatever I wanted.””I told her every single day that her life had been the world’s greatest gift to me, that I believed I was put on earth not to make movies or wear emerald-green gowns and wave at crowds but to be her mother.””I regret every second I didn’t spend with her. I regret every stupid thing I did that caused her an ounce of pain. I should have chased her down the street the day she left me. I should have begged her to stay. I should have apologized and sent roses and stood on top of the Hollywood sign and shouted, ‘I’m in love with Celia St. James!’ and let them crucify me for it.”Celia St. James:”I really like you. I like watching you on-screen. I like how the moment you show up in a scene, I can’t look at anything else. I like the way your skin is too dark for your blond hair, the way the two shouldn’t go together and yet seem so natural on you. And to be honest, I like how calculating and awful you kind of are.”Now here’s the thing, I know that Celia was the love of Evelyn’s life and I could see that they loved each other deeply, but – and here comes the hugeBUT– I had the feeling that I could never truly connect to her. I don’t know what it was that kept me from adoring her the way I adore Evelyn but I think it might have been the sum of thousands of little things that ultimately left a bad taste in my mouth. For instance I hated that Evelyn always seemed to feel like she had done something wrong and that it was her responsibility to set things right again. I mean Celia threw a lot of awful things at her too, but in the end it always seemed to be Evelyn that blamed herself for it. Also I didn’t like that Celia wasn’t only self-righteous but also more than just a little judgemental. You’d think a person who represents the “L” in LGBTQ+ would be more accepting and open-minded when her partner is bi, but nope Celia was almost as bi-phobic as the men in Evelyn’s life and that made me really sad. =(”That was how it was with Celia. When you denied her what she wanted, when you hurt her, she made sure you hurt, too.””So I told myself that the spark between Celia and me was just a quirk we had. Which was convincing as long as it remained quirky.Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.”Harry Cameron:”I want to be with someone I love. I want to have a companion. I’d like to bring someone home to my family. I don’t want to live alone anymore. And I want a son or a daughter. We could have that together. I can’t give you everything. I know that. But I want to raise a family, and I’d love to raise one with you.”Aside from Evelyn, Harry Cameron wastruly the best thingabout this entire book! <33 I loved this man so much and I think he’s an angel! He was always respectful and supportive and even more important he accepted Evelyn exactly the way she was. I loved that he and Evelyn always tried to solve every problem together and I hated to see him so sad after the death of John. T_T Harry’s grief broke my heart and even though he was drinking way too much he never did anything stupid. I mean he never hurt Evelyn or got frustrated with her, he only tried to compensate his grief without hurting anyone else in the process. Even when it came to this he was considerate and kind. =(( Poor Harry, though. It made me so damn sad that he had to go and I admit it, I actually shed some tears when he died. T_TMonique Grant:”Why, until this moment, did I not realize that the issue is my own confidence? That the root of most of my problems is that I need to be secure enough in who I am to tell anyone who doesn’t like it to go fuck themselves? Why have I spent so long settling for less when I know damn well the world expects more?”To say their relationship was complicated would be putting it more than just mildly! It was really interesting to see Monique’s character arc though. I mean at the beginning she was a shy mouse that didn’t dare to say anything to her boss and by the end of the book she was a young successful woman who stood up for herself and finally had the guts to make decisions she never even dared to consider. I think that to get to know Evelyn and to find out the truth behind her father’s death was necessary to find her happiness and I’m convinced that both of those things were able to give her some closure. I could understand her anger towards Evelyn, her hurt when she found out what she had done and the inability to truly hate her for it. Because she got to know the person behind the movie star and she knew how broken Evelyn was on the inside, how much pain she had suffered, how much loss she had endured. =( Still, that scene when she pondered whether to get on the train or not, the thoughts that crossed her mind, her inner struggle how to deal with the situation at hand. Damn, this was one of the best book moments I ever had the pleasure to read. Well done, Taylor Jenkins Reid, well done! I had goose bumps following that inner conflict. *shudders*”I’m Evelyn.” She reaches out and takes my hand, shaking it. It strikes me as a unique form of power to say your own name when you know that everyone in the room, everyone in the world, already knows it.””I insist that you be ruthless in your negotiating, Monique. Make them pay you what they would pay a white man. And then, once you’ve done that, every penny from it will be yours.”The relationships & ships:Evelyn & Celia:”I wanted to give her a lot of things. I wanted what I had to be hers. I wondered if this was what it felt like to love someone.”Those two were the death of me, I swear! Their ups and downs, their struggles and fights, their love and dreams, their hopes and shattered realities. ARGH! It was so obvious they loved each other, yet they could never be together. Because the world didn’t let them and wouldn’t have understood, because they didn’t want the same thing, because they weren’t ready to be in a relationship and unable to make arrangements. Because… justBECAUSE!There was always another reason why they couldn’t be happy, another misunderstanding that tore at their foundations, another bump on the road that caused them to drift apart. They loved and lost and loved and lost again. It was so heart-breaking to watch! And Celia, she killed me. With everything she said to Evelyn! I knew she loved her, yet she hurt her so much! >_< I just wished she would have had more sympathy for Evelyn’s outlook and I really wish she would have tried to understand Evelyn’s sexuality. So many of their problems could have been solved, they could have gained so many years if they just would have allowed themselves to be who they are. Their love was so tragic… more tragic than any of the movies they produced over the years. And it really made me sad. T_T”Evelyn, who was your great love? You can tell me.”Evelyn looks out the window, breathes in deeply, and then says, “Celia St. James.”The room is quiet as Evelyn lets herself hear her own words. And then she smiles, a bright, wide, deeply sincere smile. She starts laughing to herself and then refocuses on me. “I feel like I spent my entire life loving her.””It’s not wrong,” Celia said. “It shouldn’t be wrong, to love you. How can it be wrong?”“It’s not wrong, sweetheart. It’s not,” I said. “They’re wrong.””If you love someone enough, you should be able to overcome anything,” she said. “And we have always loved each other so much, more than I ever thought I could be loved, more than I ever thought I could love. So why … why couldn’t we overcome it?”“We did,” I said, turning towards her. “We’re here.”She shook her head. “But the years,” she said.”There’s a difference between sexuality and sex. I used sex to get what I wanted. Sex is just an act. Sexuality is a sincere expression of desire and pleasure. That I always kept for Celia.”Evelyn & Harry:”You do not know how fast you have been running, how hard you have been working, how truly exhausted you are, until someone stands behind you and says, “It’s OK, you can fall down now. I’ll catch you.”So I fell down.And Harry caught me.Their friendship was everything, absolutelyE.V.E.R.Y.T.H.I.N.G.!!!Gosh, I loved their relationship so much, I can’t even!!! They were so perfect together and understood each other better than anyone else. They were so close it sometimes felt like they could read each other’s mind and I think of all the husbands Evelyn married over the years, Harry definitely was the best! <333 (Of course her last hubby was awesome too but if you ask me no one was able to hold a candle to Harry!) I know Harry was gay and had no sexual desire for women and I know that Evelyn loved Celia but damn those two made so much sense! They shared a love that is sometimes even harder to find than the once in a lifetime love we all crave for and they were so much more than just friends. They were business partners, equals, best friends, partners in crime, confidants, soul mates and kindred spirits. And most importantly, they loved each other deeply! <333 It’s so rare to find a friend like that, so rare to have a connection like that, to be loved liked that… ARGH! I justLOVEDthem!!! This was such a wholesome representation of a deep friendship and I’m incapable to put it into words. *breaks down and sobs*”I promise I’ll do whatever I can. I promise you we will figure this out.”“OK,” Harry said, and then he squeezed my hand back and walked out the door. “We will figure this out.””I want you to stay, Harry. We need you. Me and Connor.” I grabbed his hand tighter. “But if you have to go, then go. Go if it hurts. Go if it’s time. Just go knowing you were loved, that I will never forget you, that you will live in everything Connor and I do. Go knowing I love you purely, Harry, that you were an amazing father. Go knowing I told you all my secrets. Because you were my best friend.”The bi rep:”It really makes you think, doesn’t it? That people were so eager to believe we were swapping spouses but would have been scandalized to know we were monogamous and queer?”And now we finally come to one of the most important subjects of this book: The bi rep! And let me tell you, it was spot-on! Evelyn is a bi icon and for the rest of my life I’ll never get tired of emphasizing how important this kind of representation is! Throughout the entire book Evelyn is confronted with bi-phobia but she always took it in stride! She accepted herself the way she was and she did an amazing job at trying to explain her sexuality. I know some of you might say that it shouldn’t even be necessary to explain your sexuality to others and I’m inclined to agree, but the bitter truth is that we have to explain it no matter if we want to or not. I can only speak from personal experience here but usually straight people have a hard time understanding how you can love both sexes equally and make no difference, while lesbian or gay people might just try to label you as one of their own. What Celia did?! It happens! It happens way too often and even though her actions and behaviour left a bitter taste in my mouth it still represented one of the many facets of reality. I loved the way Taylor Jenkins Reid gave Evelyn a voice though. Evelyn Hugo didn’t accept those prejudices, nope, she gave us her honest opinion, her point of view and made the other characters acknowledge her for who she was! And this was wholesome and healthy and might help a lot of people to accept themselves! So thank you Taylor Jenkins Reid! Thank you very much! <333”Being bisexual didn’t make me disloyal,” Evelyn says. “One has nothing to do with the other. Nor did it mean that Celia could only fulfil half my needs.””I hated being called a lesbian. Not because I thought there was anything wrong with loving a woman, mind you. No, I’d come to terms with that a long time ago. But Celia only saw things in black and white. She liked women and only women. And I liked her. And so she often denied the rest of me.””Wow,” he said. “Incredible. I married a dyke.”“Stop saying that,” I said.“Evelyn, if you have sex with women, you are a lesbian. Don’t be a self-hating lesbian. That’s not… that’s not becoming.”My conclusion:The more I think about this book, the more I love it! This is such an important read! I know Reid tackled a lot of problematic topics in this book, but she did it in such a positive and sensible way that I’m convinced everyone who reads“The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo”will learn something good from it! I’m usually not the kind of person who throws a book at you and says you should read it but in all seriousness: Read this one! Live and suffer with Evelyn, enjoy her good moments and cry with her when the world throws her for a loop! Hate her, love her, accept her the way she is. And most importantly, learn from her mistakes and don’t hesitate to show the world your true self. ;-)I know this review has been already way too long but I still want to thank the ever charmingAshleyfor this wonderful buddy read! We both didn’t have it easy while reading this book together, but we always managed to find a compromise and were able to continue once our lives started to become a little less hectic. *lol* I’m glad we could read this together and I hope sooner or later we’ll find another book to buddy read again! =)'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '➸4.5 stars➷ the seven husbands of evelyn hugo by taylor jenkins reid is a captivating novel that delves into the glamorous and tumultuous life of the enigmatic hollywood icon, evelyn hugo. the story is narrated by monique grant, a young journalist who is given the exclusive opportunity to interview evelyn hugo, now in her late seventies, about her legendary career and her seven marriages and tumultuous relationships that shaped her career and personal life. as monique delves deeper into evelyn’s story, she uncovers shocking revelations that force her to confront her own past and identity.— this book honestly surpassed my expectations. i’m always a bit iffy about reading popular books, but i absolutely loved this story! i honestly did not expect it to make me cry so much, seriously this book had no right ripping my heart out into tiny little pieces. i don’t even think this was supposed to be an emotional read but my heart just broke for these characters and how they weren’t allowed to love whoever they wanted. i grew so attached to these characters and parting ways with them was such a tragedy to me lmaoo. evelyn, celia, harry and john are truly my little family. i should’ve closed the book after the picnic scene and just pretended that they all lived happily ever after 😭💔tjr’s writing style is just mesmerising. she has this incredible ability for drawing you into her stories with such vivid detail that you feel like you’re right there in the moment, experiencing everything alongside her characters. this story transports us back into old hollywood and it makes me feel like i’m immersed into the glitz and glamour of the ‘50s and ‘60s silver screen.psa: mick riva needs his own tw. i’m so tired of having to see that deadbeat’s name!! he is a jump scare at this point.➳evelyn hugo:“i’m bisexual, don’t ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box.”she’s an icon, she’s a legend and she is the moment. she’s so effortlessly glamorous, she’s brilliant and powerful but that doesn’t mean she is a good person — but she’s not an unlikeable character. i understand all the decisions and sacrifices she had to make to get to where she is in life. she done some horrible things, but she would NEVER take them back because she only wanted to protect the people she loved the most. she is a flawed character, she’s ruthless, selfish, manipulative and she is unapologetic about her life choices and wasn’t afraid to use her body to get important roles. evelyn always has to get her own way but that made me love her even more and what gave her so much depth. she lived her life the best way she could. she had a dream she was determined to fulfil and she knew what she had to do to make her dream a reality.➳celia st. james:“all i’ve ever wanted was for you to be truly mine. but you’ve never been mine. not really. i’ve always had to settle for one piece of you. while the world gets the other half. i don’t blame you. it doesn’t make me stop loving you. but i can’t do it. i can’t do it, evelyn.”SCREAMING, CRYING, THROWING UP!! I WILL KEEP SAYING IT, THEY DESERVED MORE TIME TOGETHER!! TJR YOU ARE A SICK WOMAN, YOU WILL BE HEARING FROM MY THERAPIST 😭😭oh celia, the love of evelyn’s life. she’s another complicated character but i actually loved her, she’s the complete opposite to evelyn. she embodies kindness and compassion in her own right. while evelyn was portrayed as confident and assertive, celia’s demeanour was more reserved and gentle. she could be mean-spirited towards evelyn, i get she always done it out of hurt and jealousy but she had to understand that evelyn went to great lengths to protect their relationship from ever being exposed. but celia loved and cared for evelyn so deeply. tjr perfectly captured celia’s selfishness and her closeted struggles, as well as her complicated feelings with having to share evelyn with others. i would do ANYTHING for celia’s pov especially during the time when they didn’t talk for 5 years 😖➳harry cameron:“it’s ok, you can fall down now. i’ll catch you.” so i fell down. and harry caught me.the friendship between evelyn and harry is truly so special. they are the epitome of ‘platonic soulmates.’ he was present for the majority of evelyn’s life. their friendship is built on a foundation of mutual respect and understanding. they will always have each others back no matter the circumstances. my heart broke with him when he lost john because he ended up losing himself that day too. i loved his relationship with his daughter, she was truly the light of his life and what kept him going. he deserved the world and he deserved so much better. we all deserve a harry cameron in our life <33➳monique grant:as evelyn’s chosen confidante, monique finds herself drawn into a world of glamour and intrigue far removed from her own humble existence. tasked with penning evelyn’s long-awaited memoir, monique is granted unparalleled access to the inner workings of evelyn’s mind and heart, a privilege that comes with its own set of challenges and responsibilities. but i’m going to be straight up and say that her character honestly has no importance to me whatsoever. as a secondary character she was overshadowed by evelyn’s life and her character lacked so much depth. the reveal of the significant plot connection to evelyn later on left me feeling underwhelmed due to the lack of emphasis on monique and her story throughout the book.꒰evelyn + celia:꒱“i spent half my time loving her and the other half hiding how much i loved her.”i am a evelyncelia defender for life!! if they have no fans, i am dead. their love story is absolutely heartbreaking. their connection is electric, their moments together is filled with so much raw emotion and undeniable chemistry. yet as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that they are star-crossed lovers, bound by societal expectations and personal sacrifices. yes it seemed complex but at times their relationship was toxic. the ache for more time together is palpable — i’m so mad bc i wish they had so much more time together, to bask in their love without the constraints of society or circumstance. they were robbed of many precious moments and they lost so many years. every stolen moment between them is filled with longing and passion, it constantly had me yearning for more. yet amidst all the heartache, their love for one another shines so brightly. they are truly the epitome of soulmates. their relationship was so heart wrenching because they truly deserved so much better. they deserved to love each other freely and unabashedly!! ❤️\u200d🩹— overall, this book is a masterful tapestry of love, ambition, and the search for identity set against the dazzling backdrop of old hollywood. tjr’s exquisite prose and nuanced characters invite readers on an unforgettable journey, challenging them to reflect on the true cost of fame and the enduring power of authenticity. with its gripping narrative and rich historical detail, this novel transcends its genre, leaving a lasting impression on all who have the pleasure of delving into evelyn hugo’s captivating world. this story made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me angry but i adored this book and these character with my whole heart. i can’t wait for the netflix adaption, my heart is going to be broken all over again and i’m so ready for it lmaoo.───♡─────────────why did this book have me crying like a lil bitch 😭 i am evelyn hugo’s #1 defender until the day i die!! rtc—this slump is eating me alive!!! also the fact i still haven’t read this book is criminal. in tjr we trust 😩'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""This review contains a spoiler for a reveal around 100 pages into the novel. I knew this reveal going in and do not believe knowing this reveal hurts the reading experience.I think a lot about the idea of love as something dangerous, as something that you have to fight for. And it's only recently that I've decided that's something that probably has to do with loving women. I have been very lucky, in growing up in liberal California and in the 2000s. But I received marriage rights in my country four months after realizing I liked girls, and in reading about the past and thinking about the past, I am constantly, daily, reminded how being born ten years earlier would have made everything that much more dangerous, that much more violent, that much more fearful.And there is something so woefully romantic to me about the fact that there were people who braved that climate and loved anyway and paved the path, while doing so, for me and so many others.So that's all to say that this book made me experience all five stages of grief and simultaneously made me feel every positive emotion in the world and I have no idea how that is possible. but listen, if you only read one book I recommend you this year, I want it to be this one.“Make them pay you as much as they would a white man.”The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugois, yeah, about the seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo. Seven husbands who are sometimes awful and sometimes sympathetic and sometimes somewhere in between. Ernie, who she used to get to where she is, Don, who beat her till she barely knew whether to continue, Harry, who she loved more than any of them, Max, who loves the idea of her more than he could ever love her.But I think, despite its marketing, this book is really about Evelyn.Awful, complicated, completely lovable Evelyn. Evelyn is a flawed, compelling, brave, ambitious woman who got to where she was with teeth and claws and never gave up. She is also, and I’m not even joking, one of the most iconic characters I have ever had the pleasure of reading about. She is a woman with a lot of ambition but also one who loves and wants to be loved. She issucha good character.This book is also fiercely and unapologetically socio-political and Ilovethat. Evelyn’s story is one of being a woman in a man’s world. It is one of being a Cuban woman in a white woman’s world. It is one of being a bisexual woman in an era where attraction to women was demonized by the whole culture. It is one of hiding yourself for ambition, one of trying to decide which one takes precedent, one of aging, and one of never knowing whether your choices wereright.Annnnnnnd this book also has the most fucking heartbreaking romantic relationship I have had the displeasure to read about in my entire life. I don’t… I don’t know if romantic relationships should be considered spoilers, but… well, I knew going in who the actual love of Evelyn’s life was and it STILL WORKED FOR ME. So here it is: Evelyn Hugo and Celia St. James are one of my favorite fictional relationships, of all time, ever. These two have a complicated, flawed, at times tumultous relationship, and yet they love each other so much, always.“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.”And perhaps my favorite part was the messaging around the importance of actual love in relationships, rather than just a willingness to try.“You didn't come here and tell me how much you miss me. Or how hard it has been to live without me. You said you didn't want to give up. And I don't want to give up, either. I don't want to fail at this. But that's not actually a great reason to stay together. We should have reasonswhywe don't want to give. It shouldn't just bethatwe don't want to give up. And I don't... have any.“You have never felt like my other half.”I know I’ve talked about a lot of specific things in the book, but I don’t know exactly how to put into words what this bookmeantto me. You can almost feel how much Taylor Jenkins Reidfeltthis book.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugoleft me an emotional mess, but also ahappymess. All I know is I feel ruined for any other book, and I want you to be as well.Blog|Goodreads|Twitter|Youtube""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""CLICK HERE for a Booktube Videoabout:Ten Fabulous Book Reviews and One That Will Make You Go -doesn't that belong to Miranda Reads?Now that you know this one made the list check the video review to see the rest (and find the stolen surprise)!The Written Review3.75 starsHeartbreak is a loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.Evelyn Hugo was the star of the century.She dominated the big screen for more than four decades. Every man wanted her and every woman wanted to be her.Perhaps most famously, Evelyn Hugo wasmarried seven times.Each divorce only increased her fame.Rumors swept through the tabloids like wildfire.I’m under absolutely no obligation to make sense to you.And now, age 79, Evelyn Hugo decided to auction off her mostwildly famous gownsand offered one lucky journalist (Monique) an interview that will last a lifetime.However, Monique soon learns that this is beyond a two-page spread. Evelyn Hugo is offering a tell-all - a full biography - that promises to be the mostscandalous and salaciousthing that has ever graced this world.Monique would be a fool - an absolute fool - to pass this up. But the thought, the 'it's too good to be true' sort of thought, continues to replay in her mind.Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.Overall, this one was good but I was never wowed.Everyone and their mother was talking up this book and while I agree that it is engaging and scandalous (in a good way)...I don't know.I just expected more from it.I definitely think it was well-written...just a bit dull in areas.We start the book with 40 pages of just talking up Evelyn Hugo and it really did drag. There's only so many times I can hear about howwonderful and stunninga person is before it gets boring.I think if more of the marriages were teased in the beginning - just to give the audience a taste of the mystery surrounding her love life (rather than going on and on about how intriguing it was...without telling us what was intriguing about it) would have helped significantly.Once we got to her life, the book certainly picked up.I really lovedhow Evelyn's sexuality was portrayedin this book. I liked watching her grow as a person - from a teenager using sex to get herself out of a hellhole to falling in love and finding it something to be cherished.Her love forCeliathroughout the years truly made thiswildly unbelievable story cinchfor me. Honestly,her relationship with CeliaTheir love was expertly done, with all of the fear and paranoia associated with the times, that it truly felt like real life.Ultimately, this was an enjoyable read, a bit slow paced, but enjoyable nonetheless!Never let anyone make you feel ordinary.YouTube|Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Facebook| Snapchat @miranda_reads""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""WOW I NEVER POSTED THIS. What a pleasant surprise! After dozens of unposted-unwritten reviews, finally an unposted-but-written one. Life is beautiful.But first off (I can call this first off if I freaking want to!!!) I wanna say: DON’T LET ANYONE TELL YOU THAT HISTORICAL FICTION CAN’T BE DIVERSE. Tell that anthropomorphized tennis ball they’re either uncreative or a secret bigot or a full-on dunce or ALL THREE. Because this book pulls it off with more than a tablespoon of grace, I’ll tell you that.My guy, there aren’t even that many characters in this book. And we’re following the majority of them starting in the 1950s. Not exactly, y’know, the peak of support for diversity in America. AND STILL WE DON’T LACK FOR REPRESENTATION. Do you get how great that is? I’m ready to punch the whitesplainers of Disney’s Frozen in their boring pale faces. The word “Frozen” is actually a reference to the lack of movement in the creativity centers of their brains. (Follow for more behind the scenes Disney-Pixar facts.)This book includes three (three!) interracial relationships. Actually, it’s more like ten if you count the fact that our protagonist is Latina. Yes! This may be the bare minimum, but I’m so used to YA wherein one pale as snow teen romances a - gasp - pale aspaperteen! Diversity in young adult books = one character is of Western European descent and the other Eastern European. Talk about a vanilla romance. (Buh dum ch.)This book proves how important it is to provide diversity. The difference in the believability and intricacy of the story is incredible.I will say we don’t often get a good look at the variance in culture that comes with diversity here. Evelyn Hugo, though the daughter of Cuban immigrants, purposefully represses her heritage in order to fit in with the whitewashed 1950s and ’60s cinema scene. Our narrator, though half-black, expresses a fear that someone will tell her she’s “not black enough.” I wish the ethnic diversity played a little more into the text, but it didn’t feel unrealistic or anything. The reasoning was explained.But there’s even more diversity. Like, it gets even better. Because, again, despite the time setting, this book contains A SH*T TON of LGBT+ rep. And these are some of the most beautifully portrayed LGBT+ relationships I’ve ever read. If you don’t read this book for anything else, read it for that fine-ass inclusion, boi.Beyond that, this is the ultimate guilty pleasure book. IT IS SO FUN READING ABOUT OLD HOLLYWOOD AND OLD MOVIES. I wanted to watch the entire Evelyn Hugo canon after this, and then it was like, oh wait, she’s not real.I don’t have much else to say. This is chick-lit-y historical fiction at its finest. It’s just so fun. Some people say they got bored halfway through, and I get why you could, but I didn’t. I really fell in love with the world of this book, and the depiction of Old Hollywood, and all that jazz.A lot is revealed over the course of the book, and the best part is just being surprised at each twist and turn, so I don’t want to go to specifics even a little. I’m just going to cut off this review here before I risk, like, accidentally mentioning that Evelyn Hugo’s third husband turned her into a vampire and she was a vampire the whole time and she turns Monique at the end of the book.*Damn it!Bottom line: This is very fun and cool and maybe even important. Read it!!!*This isn’t true, by the way. Duh.----------------------rereading updateswas tempted to spend my whole day watching old movies and not reading at all.compromised by rereading this instead.this was a very good plan.----------------------pre-reviewThis book? It's really great.I got a hell of a lot more than I bargained for.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""This right here. This is why I read. For the joy and privilege of coming across an exquisite story like this and being swept up in its magic.CouldThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugoreally be fiction, dreamt up entirely in Taylor Jenkins Reid's mind? Every moment felt so real, so tangible. When I reached the end, it was hard to let go, hard to return to a world where this was nothing more than a figment of the imagination.Evelyn Hugo, revered Hollywood actress and icon, is finally ready to tell the story of her life. But she wants to make sure that whatever comes out is authentic to who she is. So she contacts Monique Grant, a mostly unknown writer, to be her scribe. Everyone is surprised by the choice, no one more so than Monique herself. But to be given the chance to write Evelyn's memoir and to understand the person behind the legend is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, one that Monique can't pass up.When I first started this, I thought I was in for a fluffy, gossipy romance set in the golden Hollywood era. After all, why would anyone need so many husbands unless one was in it for a good time? But this turned out to be so much more. At its heart, it's a stunning and brutally honest portrayal of love in all its different forms. It shows not just the joy of love, but also its sacrifices and heartbreaks.I was blown away by how complex of a character Evelyn Hugo is. She is the heart and soul of this story, and her character shines so bright, it's hard to look away. She feels real, coming off the pages wholly formed. She's not perfect. In fact, her flaws and numerous questionable actions make her human, and it's easy to relate to her and cheer for her.The book is written in alternative viewpoints, a little bit from Monique's perspective as she interviews Evelyn and a lot from Evelyn's perspective as she shares the story of her life. When a book has two different viewpoints, there's always a fear that one is more interesting than the other. But not here. I can honestly say that every moment of this book was equally riveting.I adored Reid's writing style. It's filled with so much charm that it just oozes off the pages. The story obviously tackles serious issues, but the writing never takes itself too seriously. It's witty and funny, drawing me in and making me feel every emotion. It manages to convey so much nuance without ever slowing down the pacing or seeming long-winded. I'm in awe.You guys know I'm a romantic through and through. And this story is all about finding and holding on to that great love of your life, no matter what it takes. I mean, how could I not be drawn to that?

It's not the kind of thing I usually pick up, and I haven't read anything by Reid before. But something about it intrigued me. So I checked out the kindle sample. Just a couple chapters, I figured, because I probably wouldn't like it anyway.And I was HOOKED.It's perfect, easy beach read material. It's not particularly deep, it does not take the genre to new levels or make you think about something new, and yet it DID feel different. Evelyn Hugo's story was sodelicious and compellingthat it stood out, and kept me turning pages in a desperate need to discover the stories behind her seven husbands, and the answer to the one question everyone wants to know: who was her greatest love?The framing of the story reminded me a lot ofThe Thirteenth Tale. Like that book, inThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, a young woman - this time an ambitious journalist called Monique Grant - goes to interview an elderly woman. UnlikeThe Thirteenth Tale, this elderly woman happens to be one of the most famous actresses in the world.Evelyn Hugo has lived a life in the public eye, but she is full of secrets. Only she knows what happened behind the scenes in her long career of scandals and highly-publicized heartbreaks. Just like the fictional world of the book longed to know the truth-- so did I. Reid and Evelyn's habit of giving you just enough to leave you wanting more was incredibly exciting. Throughout, we are encouraged to wonder why someone like Evelyn Hugo would specifically request a relatively-inexperienced journalist like Monique. Why Monique? What is Evelyn hiding?The more I got to know Evelyn, the more I fell in love with her. She has made a lot of controversial decisions during her career, but she knows it and she also knows she'd probably do it all again. She's played the Hollywood game, dated famous men to further her career, and used her body to get what she wants. She has experienced the full force of the industry's sexism and, in some ways, capitalized on it. She is deeply flawed and aware of it. She has traded important aspects of her identity for more fame, more roles, more money. She was a badass Cuban woman working in an industry that didn't like women to be badass or Cuban. She manipulated and she lied.Despite everything - and because of it - I liked her.I stayed fully engrossed in the story of Evelyn Hugo - and of Monique Grant - from the opening chapters when Evelyn demanded an interview with only Monique, through decades of Hollywood in all its shimmering ugliness, right until the ending's final reveals.I enjoyed every moment.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Best rereading choice for flashback Saturday is re-devouring my all time favorite TJR book!Evelyn Hugo a. k. a. Evelyn Elena Herrera is one of the most portrayed characters, a daughter of Cuban immigrants, raised in poverty. She’s not only beautiful, alluring but there’s something different about her: her energy is vivid, radiating. She knows what she wants for her life and she’s competitive and determined enough how she may get it by leaving her life in Hell’s Kitchen and moving to Los Angeles to become one of the movie stars, dying her hair, exposing her slender body, looking directly at the camera with her almond shaped eyes under her long lashes till the director tells her “cut”.Now she’s 79, married SEVEN TIMES, a Hollywood legend, ready to share her life story and scandalous secret she kept for years. She befriends 35 years old Monique Grant, an unknown reporter works for “Vivant” in Los Angeles. Even the boss of Monique has no clue why this Hollywood legend demanded to work with her: she could choose someone more experienced, popular, known in the industry.So many question balloons start to fly above our heads:- Why Evelyn wants to talk only Monique and if she doesn’t, the memoir deal will be off?- Why Evelyn married seven times. Did she love any of her husbands? Does she have resentments? Does she suffer from heartbreak? Which one of is the love of her life?-As soon as their interview starts, Evelyn takes her an adventurous train ride with full of juicy, entertaining, heartbreaking, emotional stories starting from glamorous 60’s of La La Land, the productions of her famous movies, how her path crossed with those men, how she saved them and they saved her, how she got hurt, how she shone, how she burned… and eventually a big secret reveals about her life story which will change everything about true identity of Evelyn and the life choices she’s made!It’s brilliant! It’s unputdownable, addictive, heartfelt time travel in Hollywood.

It is a favorite of the year, it will be a favorite of all time. I am wholly enchanted byThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugoand I will never forget how much I adore this book.CW: domestic abuse, death/grief, homophobia/biphobia, racismabortion & suicideAdult fiction is not typically my cup of tea, especially a combination of historical fiction and contemporary with the amount of long flashbacks (flashbacks: ALSO NOT MY THING). I have no idea how this combination of literary elements I typically do not like consumed my entire being, but it did. Taylor Jenkins Reid is an immensely talented author. Her prose is beautiful, vivid, and descriptive. There isn’t a moment throughout this story where I was bored or underwhelmed. Every second of this book is completely engaging – it was a huge struggle to put the book down.Evelyn Hugo is one of the greatest literary characters I have ever had the pleasure to read from. The exploration of her Cuban heritage and bisexuality is fascinating, especially given the era and her celebrity status. She is one of those intoxicating characters you will never be able to purge from your mind with her strong will, her independence, her strength, her cunning, and her compassion. Evelyn Hugo is unforgettable in my mind and hearing her story was one of the greatest pleasures I think I have ever experienced as a reader.Personally, I didn’t LOVE Monique, though I am always happy to see another biracial main character in literature. I appreciated her contribution to the story as I feel the book would lose some of it’s strength if there was not another character for Evelyn to explain her actions and motivations to and it was just her story, but it’s for that reason that I sometimes felt she was more of a plot device than an individual character. Compared to Evelyn, I just did not care for Monique’s individual life and problems. I enjoyed seeing how Evelyn influenced her life, but her storyline was so drab compared to Evelyn. Edit 4/3/2019 - After a second read, I GREATLY appreciate Monique. Her character is so nuanced and necessary to the story. I totally relinquish much of my initial feelings on her.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugois one of my favorite books OF ALL TIME.

This book came in and knocked me off my feet.Monique is working for Vivant, a media company, when she is requested to interview Evelyn Hugo, a very famous movie actress, who has refused to give interviews for years. Evelyn starts to reveal her story to Monique, that life isn\'t perfect, that people are more than just one thing, that relationships are complicated, the power of forgiveness and reinvention, the idea of family, loss, and accepting the choices of others.This book had such depth and tackled so many issues. One of them was the concept of divorce. Growing up in a Baptist church, divorce was viewed as the ultimate sin. As soon as anyone heard that someone was divorced, they had a permanent scarlet letter attached to them. However, as I matured, life isn\'t nearly as black and white. Do you really know what happened? Did the man beat this woman and then run off with all of the money, just to teach her a lesson? Why does society still think it is OK to stigmatize divorced people?There were a tremendous amounts of very quotable quotes, and this was one of those rare books that you hope never has to end.""There are people who see a beautiful flower and rush over to pick it.""This book also tackled some of the issues that women face. ""Oh, I know the whole world prefers a woman who doesn\'t know her power, but I\'m sick of all that.""

It reminded me of the family sagas of the yore, kind of likeThe Thorn Birds. Only this book needed another 300 pages to dig deeper into the dramas of Evelyn's life and her psyche. I was entertained by the events of Hugo's Hollywood adventures, but ultimately this book lacks depth. Nobody else noticed how superficial everything is in this novel - relationships, emotions, portrayals of race and queerness?The novel is framed as a biography written by a talented up-and-coming jornalist, but reads as if thrown together by an employee of a gossip rag, who included all of the salacious parts of a famous person's life, but none of that person's interiority.Totally see why it's a bestseller.

I hated every single character with the exception of maybe one but even he turned out to be a huge disappointment eventually. The plot was both simplistic yet beyond difficult to believe. Contrived and cookie cutter are also words that come to mind and will only make sense if you read it, no spoilers here. One major plot point had me eye rolling so hard I was convinced I would have a stroke. I also really, really, really disliked the main romance.

I don't think I've ever had as immediate a reaction as I did to reading this book. I feel like my updates have made my distaste for this book pretty evident, but in case it wasn't I'm going to walk through all the things I hated about this book one final time before I try and put as much space between me and this work of fiction as humanly possible.I knew going into the book that Evelyn Hugo was a Latinx character, it wasn't until I started reading though that I discovered our other narrator, Monique, was also a woman of color. [ Don't call her black though, she's biracial. ] And almost immediately I was uncomfortable with this ide. That said I carried on thinking that I was probably just stretching, reaching for things that weren't there. That said I think that the narrative utterly fails at the nuance necessary to tell the story of a Cuban-American finding success in the 50s. Utterly fails to depict the nuance in the way that someone like Evelyn would have to navigate the world, or how her racial identity would have had an impact on most of the things she experienced in life. It's really only brought up at the beginning when she's initially denied roles and Evelyn immediately pivots into this racially ambiguous/spicy white category that she's happy with becuase it ensures her success. That doesn't stop her from later bing mad that her maid doesn't know she's Cuban even though she's actively tried to supress that side of her for literally decades. I won't even get into how the narrative makes Evelyn retiring to Spain to make tortillas her reconnecting with her Cuban roots or how Monique actively distances heself from blackness while never questioning the impact that being raised by a single white mother following the death of her black father might have any role in that. You really mean to tell me that she has memories of her father but not his family? That the first black person she met was a girl in elementary school? Okay. Sidenote Evelyn just randomly dropping that she supported civil rights and MLK Jr towards the end of the book felt totally out of place and while not a big deal that part of the book felt very disconnected from what else was going on.I didn't feel attached to any of the characters really, let alone any of the seven husbands. I have ones I thought were more interesting, but that's only because so did TJR and they were the ones given more time on the page. None of the characters that appear in the novel though are nearly as developed as Evelyn Hugo, something that I think makes it easier for a reader to be drawn to. There is literally no one else. No one is given the time or energy, even the major players in her life. I didn't think that the love story between Evelyn and the person that would be the lover her life was all that compelling if anything I thought that that person was actually lowkey terrible and the romance they shared was almost certainly nothing to write home about.There are a number of deaths in this book, and again, didn't care about any of them.At the end of the day though I did enjoy the voice of Evelyn Hugo, the character to be clear. Though the most revolutionary thing about her is being a bisexual character in their 70s, there's just something about characters like Evelyn that I will always support and that's no different here. Again though it helps that Evelyn is easily the only character crafted with any kind of depth.I can't in good faith recommend that anyone read this book. I got very little enjoyment, but also there is nothing to gain? I realize and appreciate that my thoughts are in the minority here and I in no way feel like my opinion will ever be the one most agree with. If you do decide to pick this up I hope that you are able to enjoy it in ways I couldn't.Also just a warning but this book details incestuous thoughts of child sexual assault, actual child sexual assault/pedophilia, and abuse in general [ definitely physical, emotional up for discussion I'd say ] so just know that if you want to pick this up.2022 re-read thoughtsI wish that I could say that I liked this more the second time, but that would be a lie...Or at least, partly a lie. I don't think that I can raise the rating even if I objectively had a better time reading it knowing the full scope of the story I was going to be getting. Maybe the gut punch of the end of the book being so insensitive being taken out of the equation was enough for me to have a better time, I don't know.I do think that there are elements that work well here. I still think that Evelyn is an interesting character to follow with a very distinctive voice that I would appreciate in the hands of any other author. I feel comfortable saying that because I have enjoyed many a character that share her achetype.For me the ways that race were handled poorly weren't so glaringly annoying this time as much as Celia being a horrible character. From the microaggressions at the first time she and Evelyn have a meal together to the way that she acts for years toward Evelyn. It never comes across as a 'good for her' moment, her standing up for herself... but as shaming Evelyn for doing things that she herself is not doing? Shaming Evelyn for making choices that are good for both of them. I get that communication is hard... but Celia and Evelyn take this to a whole new level. It was childish. It didn't serve love of her life... It didn't serve the one that got away. I deserved better as a reader quite frankly.All of that is to say that the book giving 20ish pages to the explanation as to why Monique was chosen for this opportunity... still by far the worst part of the book. Everything about that getting wrapped up is so rushed. While the whole book feels very surface level, that in particular is damn near unforgivable. Monique deserved better as a character, the readers deserves more, and that TJR thought it was acceptable is pure foolishness.I still think everyone who has wanted to read this has read it at this point... But it really shouldn't be on anyone's tbr. It's definitely not worth the time, even with all the potential this story has.""}]"

Dragged to a treacherous magical land she knows about only from legends, Feyre discovers that her captor is not truly a beast, but one of the lethal, immortal faeries who once ruled her world.At least, he’s not a beast all the time.As she adapts to her new home, her feelings for the faerie, Tamlin, transform from icy hostility into a fiery passion that burns through every lie she’s been told about the beautiful, dangerous world of the Fae. But something is not right in the faerie lands. An ancient, wicked shadow is growing, and Feyre must find a way to stop it, or doom Tamlin—and his world—forever.From bestselling author Sarah J. Maas comes a seductive, breathtaking book that blends romance, adventure, and faerie lore into an unforgettable read.","[{'rating': 1, 'content': '(Note from 4/17/2023 So someone reported this for unmarked spoilers even tho I prefaced it lol so the spoilers will be marked where they are, even though they really aren\'t spoilers at all because they do not significantly affect the plot in any way but oh well. It\'s either do this or have the entire review hidden bc of spoilers)(Note from 2/21/2023 because I apparently have to spell it out: For those of you who don\'t read comments or check dates read, I read and reviewed this book in 2018. It has been about 5 years; as I have stated in a number of comments, I will not continue this series. In the intervening years since reading this, my feelings on the matter have not changed nor have I desired to continue. Please refrain from commenting about how I need to continue the series or that I did not understand the book. I receive too many of those comments and I\'m tired of replying the same thing over and over again. This review is for me first and foremost, not you. Please move on if you do not like my take.)Me to Sarah J Maas:""Do you lie awake at night to come up with all your witty replies for the following day?""Oh dear, this is awful.The WritingThe title of this book is stupid. It\'s stupid and flashy and unrelated to the actual content of the book. It\'s solely for the ~wow~ factor. The quotable line, ""I love you... Thorns and all"" is wholely ineffective because ""thorns"" had not been established as a motif and was only used in that context in that very scene, more than halfway through the book. The word ""thorn"" was only used a grand total of 9 times in this book. The original Beauty and the Beast story had established rose motifs—you can\'t borrow good writing, even for a retelling. That\'s just lazy.The writing itself was inconsistent and poorly done.I pushed and pulled, but the mud was too slick, and held fast.Are you aware of the definition of ""slick"", Sarah J Maas? I do not think it means what you think it means.Besides that, Amarantha\'s hair drastically changed color after about 90 pages:Her red-gold hairHer black hairWhich is it, Maas? It can\'t be both unless she has unmentioned magical hair dyeing abilities.The atmosphere and the opening chapter were excellent and I was intrigued by the idea that was offered me, but the actual book did not deliver at all.This next point is a spoiler, but because I am disgusted with Sarah J Maas for including this, I amnotgoing to mark it as such, since everyone should know what kind of morals this book is supporting before they read it especially when they are as filthy and vulgar as this was.The attemptedrapeof Feyre by Tamlin was brushed off as no more than a mere romantic, steamy encounter to further their lukewarm love story. The only conclusions I can logically draw from this are all rather victim blamey, tbh—she was warned several times to stay inside with the doors locked until dawn, but she leaves her room not once but twice before dawn because she ~wants to go to the party~ and then later, after she almost gets gang-raped and is saved and then creeped out by Rhysand the sociopath, she thinks she is totally safe to go eat a bunch of cookies because, well the drums stopped, so it\'s probably okay now, and then she getssexually assaultedby Tamlin, who wasstill high with lust magic.I was about to pass out when he grabbed me, so fast I didn\'t see anything until he had me pinned against the wall.""Let go,"" I said as evenly as I could.I [pushed] him away. He grabbed my hands again and bit my neck. I cried out as his teeth clamped onto the tender spot where my neck met my shoulder. I couldn\'t move—I couldn\'t think.Before, during and after theattack, she\'s thinking,Wow, he\'s really hot. I\'m kinda uncomfortable with this, but I guess it\'s okay that he\'s drunk on lust magic, because I wanted to sleep with him anyway. That is avery wrong and dangerous way of thinking.No matter what, it isneverokay foranyoneto make someone else sexually uncomfortable or afraid, especially when they\'ve given verbal disapproval. This entire scene left a bad taste in my mouth.And then there\'s Rhysand\'s behavior. He repeatedly violates her personal space and comfort, drugging her and forcing her to""dance""for him in front of a large crowd for weeks on end after stripping her all but naked. Like all Fae males, apparently, he uses brute force to get her to comply with his sexual wishes.""But he didn\'t actually touch her; he kept his hands just on her waist!"" you say. Yeah, but did she say he could touch her at all? Did she actively encourage him to touch her? No, she did not.I pulled away, but his hands were like shackles.I would not have such an issue with this if Sarah J Maas didn\'t give the impression that she supports such behavior. That is what I find unconscionable.Besides that, the plot made no sense, even after exposition-Alis gave us the lowdown—in fact, it almost madelesssense then. It was cheesy and cliché and frankly, boring. The ""riddle"" was extremely easy and only proved that Feyre is an absolute idiot with no logical abilities, as I was able to figure it out before Amarantha had even finished saying it, and I\'m notoriously bad at riddles.The sex scenes were almost Empire of Storms levels of bad, cringey, and gross. I think Sarah J Maas doesn\'t know what YA means and isn\'t aware she\'s actually writing for NA.The WorldbuildingThe Fae were, for one thing, almost exactly the same (primarily in appearance and personality) to the ones in the Throne of Glass series, and tbh I was disappointed. They\'re not even cleverly unique faeries. They\'re just Tolkien-esque elves that are actually vampires: fangs and biting, immortality, aetherial beauty, animalistic tendencies, superiority complex. They don\'t have any distinct differences from humans in their thought processes or emotional capacities—only the same degree of variety that exists in humans.The religious system and creation story was very interesting and I really liked that aspect.The CharactersFaerie aka Belle: Sarah J Maas decided to try something new and have a first-person fixed perspective, but it didn\'t really work, because Feyre was a bland complacent character without much substance passed the surface level, and most of the interesting action took place where she couldn\'t see it. She suffered, like Celaena did in Crown of Midnight, from what I call Nehemia syndrome: the character that the MC has grown to trust, despite obvious suspicious behavior, turns out to be manipulative, and yet the MC completely overlooks that fact in favor of idolization of their lying friend. In this case, everyone in Prythian is keeping secrets from her and after almost getting her questions answered by the Suriel, Feyre decides to ""Stay with the High Lord. He will keep you safe,"" and just completely forgets that she wants answers about the blight. Also, whereas Belle left the Beast in the original story because her father was in mortal danger, in this book, Feyre leaves becauseTamlin impies that she\'s gonna get ganked by Rhys or Amarantha, the evil Faerie Queen.She is not an active protagonist. Also, her painting skills aren\'t a part of her characterization; it just feels tacked on to make her ~cool~ and ~unique~Tampon aka the Beast: I don\'t even care about this guy tbh. He\'s a confusing character who just feels like a Chaol-Rowan merge on steroids. He\'s violent, obsessive, and abusive, but also sweet, understanding, and caring, because that\'s not a contradiction. There\'s a difference between a complex character and a poorly written character.Lucien aka Lumiere/Cogsworth (his steampunk eye suggests Cogsworth but his personality suggests Lumiere): So apparently he ""hates"" Feyre even though I almost shipped them more since they consistently had better chemistry than her and Tammy, and that\'s saying a lot, because they didn\'t have chemistry.exposition-Alis aka Mrs Potts: She was okay. Just okay. She was fine.Reese\'s Cups aka also the Beast and kinda Gaston too: Is he supposed to be her love interest for the rest of the series or something, because the fan art definitely suggests that, but, uh, did everyone forget that he\'s a dangeroussociopathwith a history of violence?? He has no regard for her emotional well-being and sees her body as literally nothing beyond a sexual plaything. He\'s a horrible person.Amarantha: Why did there have to be a ""big bad evil Faerie Queen"" in this at all? There\'s already one in the Throne of Glass series and I can only take so much female-against-female hate from a supposedly feminist fantasy writer. Amarantha was bland and predictable, and her motivations were extremely surface-level.Her fam: Nesta was like, supposed to have some kind of implied character arc but lol it wasn\'t very good. Elain was nice and I liked her. The dad was okay, I guess. Pretty forgettable tbhIsaac Hale aka fake-out Gaston: This character wasn\'t important at all, but I just wanted to say that I think this is the dumbest name choice in a high fantasy book that I\'ve ever seen.Isaac Hale?? Really, Sarah J Maas? Really? That\'s the Jason of fantasy names. This is a the-guy-who-went-to-high-school-with-my-older-sister kind of name. It\'s not a fantasy name.ConclusionWhile I managed to read it fairly quickly, I had to dnf it for several days before deciding to trudge through. It was horrendous. I may pick up the sequel at some point, idk, but for now, from what I predict and understand from various spoilers I\'ve encountered on the internet, I don\'t really care about this series very much. Frankly, it\'s not good.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""That was both horrible and incredible at the same time, and my thoughts are a whirlwind.Note: The first part of this review is spoiler-free, but the second half is most definitely not. The spoilery section is blocked off by siren emojis (🚨). Skip to the end for bonus content, including an ACOTAR rap written by yours truly.This is the story of a mortal girl, Feyre, who kills a Fae in the woods one day. She’s whisked away to Prythian, home of the Fae, where she will live the rest of her days as punishment for murdering the wolf.Whoever said this was a Beauty and the Beast retelling is clearly not okay. This is far from a retelling, becauseit takes all the important themes outand leaves just the bare plotline:1. The Beast (Tamlin) is not ugly or even a beast at all. He just has a mask stuck to his face forever as part of a curse that I will get into more in the spoilery section.2. We are not aware of any good reason for Tamlin to keep Feyre until the very end, and it’s still a flimsy reason (this relates back to the curse).The problem with the plot is that the foreshadowing is so faint. The plot in the beginning and up until the 75 percent mark makes no sense at all. Tamlin takes Feyre to live in luxury, with good food and nice clothes and freedom, because she killed his fellow Fae? It’s just nonsensical.How is that a punishment at all?She no longer has to care for her spoiled sisters, she’s away from the poor village.However, it does make sense in the end, but Feyre is very naive for believing all of this. Something doesn’t add up. People who DNF this book will be very confused indeed.In Beauty and the Beast, we know of the curse beforehand, so we can find a good reason for the Beast to be kind to Belle. But Tamlin? It’s a mystery.So anyway, Feyre gets taken to a land of luxury to live out the rest of her days in comfort as “punishment,” but she’s still not happy because for some reason she misses her sisters, even though they treated her like dirt.She falls in love with Tamlin, which was expected because he’s not a Beast. There’s no barrier to overcome here.She isn’t forced to look past his ugly exterior because he has no ugly exterior.Along the way, another Fae named Lucien conveniently reveals everything Feyre needs to know right before it happens. This is supposed to be foreshadowing? I think? But in the end, he makes things so easy for Feyre and there’s no conflict whatsoever.The only problems arise from Feyre’s own stupidity.Their exchanges basically go like this:Lucien: The Suriel are super dangerous and even hard for the Fae to trap so stay away.Feyre: *makes simple snare* *kills chicken* oOpS I caught one, what a coincidence!!Everything is far too easy for Feyre.She’s supposed to be a responsible hunter, but instead she makes stupid, reckless decisions that don’t line up with her character. She follows an illusion of her father despite being told it’s fake, she goes outside on Fire Night, she chases the Suriel, she goes after Tamlin… etc.If you tell her not to do something, she will do it.Lucien: Stay in your room, it’s dangerous.Tamlin: Stay in your room, it’s dangerous.Literally everyone ever: Stay in your room, it’s dangerous.Feyre: *gets a midnight snack*Feyre is trying to figure out the details of this blight that’s supposed to be taking over Prythian, but luckily for her, Lucien and Tamlin give everything away with no struggle whatsoever.The result is thatthe danger does not feel genuine.It feels like a cheesy way to add angst to the relationship between Feyre and Tamlin.Speaking of Tamlin, everyone hates him so much but he’s such a sweetheart. I know that he gets worse in ACOMAF, but there’s nothing wrong with him in this book. He may be a little bland, but he’s much better than Rhysand. More details in the spoilery section.And then we have the writing, which is just bad. “...” is used in every other sentence, the poor em dashes are abused, and Feyre’s bones bark. A lot. Like, every time she falls down, she describes her barking bones. And what’s up with the phrase “my bowels turned watery?” It’s used at least twice and I don’t like it at all. This is notShatter Me.🚨🚨🚨SPOILER ALERT🚨🚨🚨So, what’s up with Amarantha?I really do like her. She’s a compelling villain because she’s (somewhat) realistic. Sure, she tortures people for fun, but her backstory makes this seem (somewhat) reasonable. (Somewhat.)Basically, she kidnaps Tamlin and Feyre runs after them because she has no self-preservation instinct. She challenges Amarantha, and in return, she is given three trials. If she wins them all, she and Tamlin will be free and his powers will return. If she loses… well, Amarantha keeps saying that there wouldn’t be enough left of Feyre to burn.However, Amarantha gives her a different option. She could solve a riddle.This is when things go downhill. First of all, why would Amarantha bet all her power and might on a simple riddle? It’s not even that hard to solve. The riddle itself is bad. The rhyming pattern isn’t great. And worst of all, the answer?It’s love.The answer is love.How does this make sense? Amarantha is a brutal, sadistic villain, so why would she write such a cliche, cheesy riddle?She should have made it oddly specific so Feyre would never get it.Anyway, Feyre answers it correctly at the last minute, Amarantha loses all her power, and Tamlin kills her.It was far too easy.Moving onto Rhysand. I hate him with a burning passion. He’s a greasy, crusty, dusty, musty old man. I can’t believe Feysand is the endgame ship. I’m suing. This is ridiculous. I don’t understand how people love him. He’s abusive, uncomfy, and weird.People keep telling me that I will love Rhysand in ACOMAF and hate Tamlin. First of all, I highly doubt it.Second of all,if you have to rely on making one character a villain just to get people to like the other character, that’s bad writing.Finally, the curse is so specific and random. Tamlin has to fall in love with a mortal girl who hates the Fae so much that she killed one in cold blood, and he has to wear a mask, and she can't know it's a curse.🚨🚨🚨END OF SPOILERS🚨🚨🚨In conclusion: Feyre is an idiot, Tamlin is precious, and Rhysand deserves to rot in a hole.Also, I wrote a rap. It’s called *prim coughing fit*Feyre Darling.Slight spoilers for ACOMAF.Feyre DarlingBy SofiaI let out a breath I didn't realize I was holdingRhys's hair is black but Tam's is goldenWill my bones bark or will they meowCome along Suriel and sing with me nowMy name is FeyreFeyreAnd I'm a standard YA MCWhat stupid things will I do?

DNF at 30% because I just got fed up with things moving at a snail\'s pace and NOT MAKING SENSE AT ALL. This was one of the most uncompelling versions ofBeauty and the Beastthat I have ever read. The writing is nothing outstanding, there was nothing that moved me. I feltCruel Beautyamong other B&B retellings I\'ve read this year and last have done a far superior job at moving me emotionally.Look, I\'m sure by the end of the book, all the things tie together and everything\'s just dandy and things will make sense, and I\'d be like ""ooooooh, so that\'s why ____."" Me, I don\'t care. Ain\'t nobody got time for that. I have so many questions and I\'m just fed up. This is not a retelling of Beauty and the Beast. This is a book about a girl who gets to live an easy life with a guy who\'s implied to be a gorgeous Fae underneath his mask.The original story makes sense: here\'s roughly how it goes. Handsome prince is cursed to be ugly unless he gets a chick to fall for him. Flash forward, there\'s Belle\'s dad. Belle\'s dad wanders into Beast\'s castle and touches his stuff. Beast doesn\'t like the fact that Belle\'s dad touched his stuff. Beast is going to kill Belle\'s dad unless he gets Beast some pussy. Belle\'s valiantly steps in to save dad, Beast is as nice to her as much as a hairy ugly, self-conscious, socially ostracized monster can be. Belle is treated like a princess because Beast really, really fucking needs her to save him and his people before the curse runs out!There\'s a reason Belle is treated like the queen! Things make sense! They have to learn to trust one another. Things are slowly developed an built over time. There is a hideous beast who is scarred emotionally, and a beauty who needs to look past the exterior. There is a point. Not so with this book.Things are far, far too easy with this book.Now here\'s this version of Beauty and the Beast,a retelling that tries to be bad-ass and fails completely,from the little that I have read.There\'sFeyrewho has a pretty crappy life with an absentminded, worthless, spineless dad, and two of the most bitchy, ungrateful sisters in the entire world. She slaves for them, she hunts food for them, she works her ass off for them. Without her, their family would starve. They don\'t care. I feel some pity for her, but she acts like so much of a martyr that there\'s only so much I can take.While hunting one day, Feyre kills a wolf, well, surprise, surprise, that wolf turns out to be a Fae in disguise. In return for this kill, Feyre is taken by a wolf (who\'s a Fae in disguise) away from her family.“What is the payment the Treaty requires?”His eyes didn’t leave my face as he said, “A life for a life. Any unprovoked attacks on faerie-kind by humans are to be paid only by a human life in exchange.”A life for a life!Oh, no! Is she going to die?! That\'s what a life for a life means, right?WRONG. Feyre is taken off to magical Fairyland to live in luxury for the rest of her life while her family is taken care of back in their little village.“Some would say it’s unwise to insult a Fae in his home,” Tamlin ground out. “Some would say you should be grateful for me finding you before another one of my kind came to claim the debt, for sparing your life and then offering you the chance to live in comfort.”So what?!Why?!This makes no sense at all.Feyre kills one of their kind. A beloved brother.In exchange, there isabsolutely no punishment whatsoever. She gets to live in a fantastically fabulous castle, waited on by servants. She gets beautiful clothes and delicious food.Another useless answer. I dug into my breakfast, savoring each rich sip of tea, and she slipped into the bathing chamber. When I was done eating and bathing, I refused Alis’s offer and dressed myself in another exquisite tunic—this one of purple so deep it could have been black.Clearly there is some kind of a setup involving The Treaty, since there seems to be a lot of secrecy between the Fae...but wait, whatever information she wants, the Fae reveals...they\'re revealing their own weakness to Feyre, who is constantly plotting her own escape.It doesn\'t make any sense!“There is … a sickness in these lands. Across Prythian. There has been for almost fifty years now. It is why this house and these lands are so empty: most have left. The blight spreads slowly, but it has made magic act … strangely. My own powers are diminished due to it. These masks”—he tapped on his—“are the result of a surge of it that occurred during a masquerade forty-nine years ago. Even now, we can’t remove them.”Over and over and over,the Fae reveal their secrets to her, including one that might help her escape.“So there are faeries who will actually answer any question if you trap them?” Maybe they’d know how to free me from the Treaty’s terms.“Yes,” he said tightly. “The Suriel. But they’re old and wicked, and not worth the danger of going out to find them.And then pretty much the next chapter, she goes out AND IMMEDIATELY FINDS THESE MYSTERIOUS CREATURES. WHAT THE FUCK.I do not like it when things come so easily to a main character, and everything comes easily to Feyre. There is no consequence whatsoever to her actions. There is no punishment to her deed of killing. The Fae are supposed to hate her...it doesn\'t feel like it, because she is ""inconsequential."" In fact, they\'re more of her playmates than her wardens. The Fae seem to have no other things to do besides play with her and hunt with her.“My morning work was postponed,” he said. Indeed, his usual tunic was off, the baldric gone, and the sleeves of his white shirt had been rolled up to the elbows to reveal tanned forearms corded with muscle. “If you want a ride across the grounds—if you’re interested in your new … residence, I can take you.”And teach her how to read and write...because Feyre cannot read or write, an ironic twist to the Disney Belle\'s love for reading.“I could help you write to them, if that’s why you’re in here.”Feyre is irreverent, ungrateful and insulting to her wardens...in a way that gets her no punishment whatsoever.“Do you ever stop being such a prick?” I snapped back.Dead—really, truly, I should have been dead for that.But Lucien grinned at me. “Much better.”As I said, I\'m sure this book improves in the end, but from what I\'ve read, this book makes no sense, the writing is emotionless, the characters are flat, the main character unrealistic, and I do not care to continue.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""INITIAL REACTION: WILL UPDATE WITH REVIEW LATER BUT KNOW I LOVED THIS.

I started reading it as soon as it became available and the array of positive reviews from my friends and strangers alike made me feel sure I would love it. But I didn\'t. It is possible I expected all the wrong things fromA Court of Thorns and Roses, and maybe my review can prevent others from doing the same.Here\'s what I expected:an intricate fantasy world, supernatural politics and alliances, fast-paced action, a sensual romance - perhaps similar toCruel Beautyand otherBeauty and the Beastretellings, and a flawed but likable heroine.But this book is, if you ask me, nothing more or less thansoftcore erotica. Which is fine, if that\'s what you\'re looking for.I personally thought that the fantasy aspect felt like trimmings around a story that was all about a romance between Feyre (the narrator) and Tamlin (a High Lord of the Fae). There are some titillating scenes where Tamlin bites Feyre\'s neck and they have sex - undoubtedly the best bits of the book and I won\'t pretend I didn\'t feel a little hot under the collar myself. But the ""ancient wicked shadow"" promised in the blurb is only really a source of more romantic angst for Feyre and Tamlin.However, I *do* like a good romance as much as anyone, so there are other reasons this book didn\'t quite work for me. In order to express what I mean, I\'m going to compareA Court of Thorns and RosestoCruel Beauty, which is, in my opinion, a better book.In CB, I felt the chemistry between Nyx and Ignifex as soon as their loaded banter started to fill the pages. They were sexy together, Ignifex was an evil ruler (which was a real problem for their relationship) with blood-red eyes, and the supernatural part of the book was creepy, weird and completely unique. Despite enjoying the actual non-PG scenes inA Court of Thorns and Roses, I never felt any real chemistry between Feyre and Tamlin or any realistic challenge to their relationship.What makesBeauty and the Beastsuch a compelling romance?One that demands to be told over and over again in so many different ways? I\'ll tell you what it is: it\'s the obstacles, the challenges, the improbability...how can a young woman come to love an ugly beast?We ask.I\'ll prove it\'s possible!The author replies. That\'s why readers fall in love with the beast again and again, even when he is furry and has horns like the Disney version. I loved the Disney beast.And that badass fox in Robin Hood so it\'s possible I have issues.Tamlin is not a beast.“Even as he bit out the words, I couldn’t ignore the sheer male beauty of that strong jaw, the richness of his golden-tan skin.”Oh my, how could a poor young woman ever love a pretty-faced, golden-haired, completely not evil Fae prince? How weird.Maas is a good writer and the beginning - before Feyre is taken to the Fae world - made me believe a great book was on the way. When Maas writes action, she writes actionreallywell. But there was far too little of it in this book. It came in behind the descriptions of beautiful Fae men and the Fae palace.In short:It just wasn\'t nasty enough.In truth, this felt more like an extended Cinderella retelling than what it was supposed to be. A girl lives in poverty and looks after her rather annoying sisters until one day she is swept up by a prince who takes her to his beautiful palace (after about three chapters). I just find it hard to recommend this when I thinkCruel Beautyis similar and yet so much better.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Tumblr'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""4.45/5 ⭐Full review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolf🐺This book’s mood song match –Fix You by Coldplaymum: *enters kitchen at 3 am* What the hell are you doing?me: *with a bowl of ice cream in one hand and ACOTAR in the other* I'm starting another SJM seriesmum: Hang on, I have a bottle of vodka here somewhere*And if this is not some relatable shit when facing Sarah J. Maas’s books then I don’t know what to tell you anymore. You puzzle me.So, there you go – another great universe erected by SJM just in front of our humble eyes. She is building her own fucking multiverse and we are here to witness the power of a goddess at work. I will make three sacrifices for that.This is, so far, for me, the best Beauty and the Beast reimagination.HER EXECUTION STYLE IS THE AIR TO MY LUNGS.And this one is not even the best of her works.“Magic – everything was magic, and it broke my heart.”Mainly, our action is happening at the Spring Court where our main character finds herself in front of a new intriguing life. Or at least as intriguing as a Court of flowery gardens can be.As I always say about SJM’s books,the characters are the ones who make the action. It’s like they are the very engine of a plot.I kind of likeFeyre. She definitely has her own personal issues, mainly because she is broken and lonely and desperate to beat her status. She is human and miserable, mainly because her family is horrible. Her whole family was created to look like the typical fairytale family – an absent coward of a father, an uninterested mother, a sister full of wicked hatred and another one caught up in her own world, sensitive and naïve. Until her sisters do something worthy of my affection, I ain’t changing my mind about them.Lucien(the Emissary of the Spring Court), I must say, I liked from the very beginning, but he somehow managed to grow on me. There was something likeable about him at first and he only proved that to me more as the action went on.Tamlin, the High Lord of the Spring Court, on the other hand, seemed a bit stiff the whole book, even though I sometimes appreciated the occasional softness of his heart.But full-on honesty now – thebestthing about this book, the one thing that made it 110% better wasRhysand. He won for this book a full star from me with all of his domineering prick moves. He played the bad boy role so good that my traitorous heart enjoyed him whole. I might have a problem but oh, what a perfect problem he is.“His voice was a lover’s purr that sent shivers through me, caressing every muscle and bone and nerve.”Sexy.Rhysand and Feyre certainly have a sort of total chemistry that it seems Feyre doesn’t have with Tamlin; not even after theysupposedlyfell in love with each other. I don’t buy that love for more than a second and by the end when everything seemed to try to make me believe their relationship I was still not convinced.I recognise fabulous chemistry when I see one and that ain’t it. Rhysand, you’d better act up, love, I have expectations. You’re more than just a cruel, beautiful ruffian, I know it.There’s a certain cruelty in this book, so very Maas. I sometimes feel like I’m reading the words of a psychopath, but then I remind myself how much Ienjoythis cruelty in these books and I temperate myself.That crazy wretch Amarantha is definitely the embodiment of cold murder and torture in this book and this is visible when it comes to how much her actions affect the other characters’ moods and movements. It’s terribly interesting though to see how terrified all of them can become when facing her.But by the end, there was this sliver of hope that lingered. And that broke the evil to pieces.“This wasn’t music to dance to – it was music to worship, music to feel in the gaps of my soul, to bring me to a place where there was no pain.”Even though I think this is not the best of SJM’s works, I still believe is so very good that just makes you want to know more. It leaves you craving. And in my humble opinion, that’s a bonus factor in books.All and all, my first step into the ACOTAR universe has been a success. More steps to come. Until I fall in love. Wholly and irrevocably.""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I cannot remember ever being this conflicted over a book. There are parts of A Court of Thorns and Roses I really loved, but a lot of parts I really hated.I went into this book fully expecting to love it. Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite fairy tales, and I was interested to see how SJM made the story her own.First off, my biggest problem with this story was Feyre as a character. I have never been so irritated. Her character development and personality, for the most part, didn\'t make sense to me. She was the caretaker of her entire family for years, supposedly a hunter with a strong survival instinct. And yet, she proceeded to make the stupidest decisions and put herself in danger time and time again. I didn\'t get the sense that she did this out of bravery, but more out of stupidity. It didn\'t mesh with what her character was supposed to be. Examples of these idiotic choices:1. Repeatedly plotting to escape into a faerie land that she knew to be deadly, when she was asleep on the way to the manor and obviously wouldn\'t know her way back to the mortal lands2. Running after the illusion of her CRIPPLED father at NIGHT, when she has been told and witnessed how deceptive fae can be3. Trapping a Suriel with little more than a snare, in the deadly part of the forest, after she has been told, and AGAIN, SEEN how dangerous these creatures are4. Going to Fire Night after being told how dangerous it is, not leaving after being almost raped by 3 faeries, and then proceeding to leave her room AGAIN afterwards5. Drinking the faerie wine at the Solstice, even after Lucien of all people warned her not to6. Leaving the manor when the Suriel flat out TOLD her not to and that she would be safe with Tamlin, and deciding to not mention that to ANYONE before he forced her to leaveIn addition to all of these idiotic choices, she also is incredibly inconsistent. She\'ll go from hating Fae to sympathizing with them to loving them back to fearing them at the drop of a hat. These inconsistencies are probably the most irritating, as there are scenes that I absolutely adore with Feyre, but then she goes back to doing the next pain in the ass thing on the next page.I also found her relationship with Tamlin to be problematic. Yes, I do enjoy problematic things (especially ships from time to time) but there were a lot of things I couldn\'t excuse with them. Again, more inconsistencies in characters\' behavior. Tamlin\'s hot and cold behavior was eventually explained, but not until 70% of the way through the book. It was too little too late. Also,I found the Fire Night scene to be a problem for me. I do enjoy volatile relationships and bad boy characters. But only when we are told from the beginning that one of the characters is ""bad"". Tamlin we are led to believe is a saint, then he bites her and gets possessive, but all is forgiven the next morning. Because he\'s a ""nice guy."" No.The world building I found to be lackluster in a lot of ways. While I really enjoyed the wide variety of Fae creatures we got to see, I thought that a lot of the back story was revealed in a lazy way. Instead of having Feyre figure anything out for herself, important things are told to her through long monologues from a number of characters throughout the book. This happens numerous times.Additionally, few side characters have any development and most felt like blank slates. With that being said, the ones that were developed I adored. Lucien and Rhys saved the book for me in a lot of ways. I found them both to be complex and interesting characters.The last 10-15% of the book saved it for me. I found the plot to finally be interesting, and I found Feyre\'s decisions in those chapters to actually make sense. A lot of things were set up for future books that have me very intrigued, and I\'m looking forward to the rest of the series. Many things that I disliked in this book, may in fact be remedied due to some of the occurrences in this last small section of the book.Overall, I was disappointed by this first installment. While there were elements I really enjoyed, they didn\'t make up for the elements I didn\'t. I\'m hoping future installments will prove to be better.I will also be doing a full video review and spoiler-filled discussion on mychannelin the future if you want to know more of my thoughts.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""If you've ever wondered which literary world would be the best to live in, wonder no longer, cause there's aBookTube Videoto answer that!The Written Review:----------Update - 12/6/19ShouldI cross the insurmountable TBR? Or reread this series again?I think you know the answer----------Here's the original review:Feyre is huntingin the middle of the woods tokeep her useless starving family alive(Hunger Games, anyone?).A chance encounter with a wolf - who wasn't entirely a wolf - leaves Feyreon the wrong end of an ancient treaty.She is forced to go to the fairy realm to live out the remaining years of her human life -no friends, no family and no freedom.“Has anyone ever taken care of you?” he asked quietly.“No.” I’d long since stopped feeling sorry for myself about it.At first, she cannot think of anything but escape. Slowly (but surely), she is swept into the fairy realm -in its magic & intrigue, in its danger & hopelessness, and in its wonder & glory.“Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, Dawn, Day, and Night,” it mused, as if I hadn’t even answered. “The seven Courts of Prythian, each ruled by a High Lord, all of them deadly in their own way. They are not merely powerful—they are Power.”Feyre lands in the Spring court - which is under amasquerade cursefor nearly fifty years.The court is being attacked by all manner of terrible creatures and there is ablight upon the land.This blight will soon cross to the human realm - threatening everyone Feyre holds dear.The first half sucksbut keep readingThere's no way around it. From page 1 to about 200, Feyre isannoying and obstinate.I nearly put this book down half a dozen times (it was like readingRed Queen).BUT, there was something about it that kept me interested.AND THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT.Because wow. Seriously wow.Midway through the book,things turned around magnificently.It was like a whole new book.Sarah J Maas is a devious little thing.Suddenly, all the plot holes, nonsensical actions of her fairy captors (Tamlin and Lucien) and Feyre's complete idiocy flipped on their heads.Everything makes sense now.I literally could not put this down.Though, and maybe it's just me, butthe Tamlin-Feyre arc felt a bit rushed/forced.Her constant love declarations really had me questioning their relationship. But then again, I had a friend who accidentally spilled the beans on that one.Without giving any spoilers, I sure hope book 2 does acomplete character shifton you-know-who (NOT voldemort) because I amnot pleasedwith the way the love interest was hinted at during the end of the book. (He's such a jerk!)Overall, I amamazedby how much effort Sarah J. Maas put into constructing this story. I'm this close || to rereading the book solely to better appreciate all those little clues that I must have passed over.So, if you pick this up and just aren't feeling it -keep reading- trust me.The Finer Books Club - 2018 Reading Challenge: A book recommended by a friendYouTube|Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Facebook| Snapchat @miranda_reads""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""4.8/5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️“Don't feel bad for one moment about doing what brings you joy.”I'm speechless. What am I supposed to say after this? Am I supposed to write a coherent review with vital points as to why this book WAS FUCKING AMAZING??? I CAN'T EVEN TALK RIGHT NOW I'M SPEECHLESS. I WANT THE SECOND BOOK IN MY HANDS BUT MY ORDER STILL HASN'T COME. I'M READY TO GO TO FUCKING ENGLAND MYSELF AND PURCHASE IT. KIDS I'M LITERALLY DYING HERE.The Beauty and the Beast-esque fantasy drama tells the story of Feyre, who finds herself entwined with faeries after unknowingly killing one. When the 19-year-old huntress kills a wolf in the woods, a beast-like creature arrives to demand retribution for it. Dragged to a treacherous magical land she only knows about from legends, Feyre discovers that her captor is not an animal, but Tamlin, one of the lethal, immortal faeries who once ruled their world. Feyre must find a way to stop it or doom Tamlin and his world forever.I'm not a fantasy fan. I love fantasy in film and tv but not in books. I picked up this book cause I wanted to use it for my thesis for uni (don't even ask) and now after I graduated I decided to give it a go. My favorite genres to read are historical fiction and contemporary, and fantasy falls on a very different category. But the fantasy in this book man... it gripped me tight and didn't let me go.First I started off this book a bit confused. The language confused me a bit, the terms, all the information. I'm reading books in English while my native language is Greek so fantasy fell a bit harsh on me. As I said, I'm not a fantasy fan, and with fantasy comes many weird words and shit like that. But I kept going and after a while I got used to everything and started to enjoy the plot and the characters. I enjoyed very much the factor that there weren't many characters in this book. I don't like when a book is crowded with characters, it doesn't give me the space to love them all. This book succeeded in making all the characters lovable for me... even Rhysand. I fucking love Rhysand man. Unexpected feelings happening.The worldSarah J. Maascreated is so rich and dark and gloomy but also happy and hopeful and full of light, I truly enjoyed reading about it. I always get bored, to be honest, with descriptions and politics of different worlds but this one excited me. Even the fucking politics were exciting. I want to delve more into this world wHEN MY FUCKING BOOK ARRIVES.Now to the juicy shit... the romance. Holy fucking shit. I ship these two so hard I can't even breathe. When he sent her away I wanted to scream! He gave her a good fucking and left her hanging. Why am I laughing at this? But honestly, the romance was amazing. At first, I felt like the entire book was only gonna be about the romance and I didn't quite enjoy that but after all the revelations and the twists in the plot, the romance was used wisely. And I didn't expect that, because I have heard lots of things about this book. And now we have Rhysand... this dark, handsome motherfucker who has a gloomy past. This will become a triangle, I can feel it in my bones. But I'm here for it, for some reason. I love the heat Maas's romances convey in me.To sum it all up, this book took me a while to get into but it was all worth it. Maybe after this book I will start reading more fantasy. Maybe. Maybe not. As I'm waiting for the sequel to arrive, I will drawn my sorrow into crying about how amazing this first book was. Or maybe reread some parts. Maybe. Anyway, till the next one K BYE!!!""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '2.5 StarsOnce again, I find myself the odd man out when it comes to a massively popular book...I went into this really excited and andreallywanting to love this thing.After seeing this book and its successors paint my feed with its courts and thorns and wings and ruin, I knew there was a lot of hype surrounding this series in general.And this first installment just didn\'t live up to it for me, sadly.There, there, Court Thornians...Quite frankly, the first 60% of this book dragged like a U-Haul trailer with no wheels.Nothing really happened and the things that did didn\'t even make sense until after the book was over.And I\'m just not a fan of that. I like to enjoy bookswhileI\'m reading them, not only for the last 25-35% when everything that was murky throughout the whole book becomes clear.I also found myself WAY more interested in Rhysand than the actual love interest, Tamlin. Whoops!THAT SAID.Ididenjoy the writing and the ending.And while those things aren\'t enough to prompt me to rate this thing any higher,I AM going to read the second book.I trust my peeps and all of you are saying that, while the first book drags, the second book is ""OMG amazeballs.""

Despite not being a fan of the superfluous writing style or the lackluster world-building, I was still willing to rate it 3 stars by viewing it as an easy guilty pleasure romance book. The relationship seems harmless and I still don't see how it's as problematic as people dramatize it to be. The first half of the book is a standard Beauty and the Beast retelling — not awful, but not special either — and then the second half really dips in quality, which lowered my rating to 2 stars.A couple glaring issues that stood out to me:1) The background story of the curse is literally told instead of shown via a side character's lengthy monologue. This was disappointing since I was intrigued to find this out by piecing clues together, not by being told it straightforwardly like a regurgitated wikipedia article.2) The main character seems relatively smart but consistently has leaps of logic that are clearly there for the sake of plot. 9 out of 10 times she won't follow the advice of another character.3) The antagonist is SO cartoonish — like mustache-twirling cartoonish. She gives a bunch of arbitrary challenges and rules for no reason other than for the sake of stringing along a story. It feels like she's hosting a game show or some overly complex scavenger hunt. There's no reason why she'd bother setting up any of these superfluous rules. I think this is the worst antagonist I've ever read.I'm willing to overlook the writing style and bland romance, but once I got to the part where Feyre answers the riddle, I had to drop it down to 2 stars because it was so ridiculous and lazy. I've heard that the sequel is much better though, so I am willing to give it another try, just not any time soon haha.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'First read: May 2015Second read: May 2016Third read: April 2017Fourth read: February 2018Fifth read: June 2019 — I think this is my most read series alongside Harry Potter and Mistborn.Sixth reread: Feb 2021Seventh reread: September 2023Every reread of this book has somewhat differed but nothing too drastic. It’s still my least favourite in the series. There’s nostalgia involved since this was my first book by Sarah J Maas. I’ve become really familiar with these books now. Or maybe I should say attached.It’s a great Beauty and the Beast retelling. It’s a great setup for the books to come, especially where Feyre is concerned and her character development, which is where Maas excels at.I quite frankly hated how loyal Feyre was to her family, though it’s understandable. But it’s this level of loyalty without any concern for her own well-being that leads to her downfall. Her loyalty to Tamlin when it came to the events that happen towards the end of the book destroy her. It was uncomfortable to read and see Feyre come to this realisation herself.This seems to straddle the line of YA and NA fantasy, which is why I’m assuming the world-building feels so lacklustre, and at times, juvenile. Amarantha read like a spoiled child, though she’s the villain. I just didn’t care for the magic and world-building in this book because of how underdeveloped they felt.Thank the stars this improves leaps and bounds in the sequels.

She’s come a long way from the small town where she grew up—she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. And when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life seems too good to be true.Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan—her first love and a link to the past she left behind.

Where are all the people who wonder why the men are even abusive? Isn\'t that where the only blame should be placed?""━━━━━━━━━━━ ♡ ━━━━━━━━━━━tw: graphic domestic violence, graphic attempted rape, suicide, depression, alcohol abuse, depressionUpdate:One of my Goodreads friends broughtthis articleto my attention: an article by domesticshelters.org that outlines the harmfulness of this book. Definitely worth the read.I’ve rewritten this review three times now, andeach time I’ve felt it necessary to lower my rating.I don’t intend for this to be a hot take. I’m not trying to be unique or quirky for disliking a popular book but every day I grow more and more concerned with the number of people who misinterpret and romanticize this book. There will be spoilers in this review.I’d like to begin by acknowledging Colleen Hoover’s intent with this book and how I believe it is a serious problem.Firstly,Colleen Hoover has expressed her disapproval and dislike for trigger warnings.She expressed that“as a fellow reader with my fair share of past experiences, I understand that there are issues some people do not want to read about. But as a writer, there are many things I don’t want revealed in the blurbs of my books.”This is extremely irresponsible and inconsiderate of an author.Furthermore, this book has been and is marketed as a love triangle andColleen Hoover employs the fact that Ryle is an abusive fucker as a plot-twist.In the author’s note, she states that “In the past, I’ve always said I write for entertainment purposes only. I don’t write to educate, persuade or inform. This book is different.”Yet, she continues to format this more serious book, similarly.Furthermore, although I understand that Colleen“wanted to write something realistic to the situation my mother was in – a situation a lot of women find themselves in”, I feel that Ryle was very different to her father.This coming explanation is just my presumption and random thought process. I could have greatly misinterpreted what Colleen went through and I do not mean to be disrespectful.I do not doubt that domestic abuse can be very different, but I believe the fact that Colleen’s father was an alcoholic has a huge impact on her final opinion of him. One could argue that her father needed help, and that although he is to blame, it did not come purely from malintent and manipulation. I am not saying that he is redeemable by any means, only that part of the violence can be due to an unintentional factor. Ryle still ends up having custody over the baby. This is infuriating to me.But we see that she wrote it this way because Colleen still had a relationship with her abusive father after her mother divorced him.Then we have the way that Colleen\'s father continues to (in my opinion) manipulate her by showing kind, good aspects of himself, like agreeing and encouraging Colleen’s stepfather to walk her down the isle rather than him. Just a thought or something to possibly consider.And in this book, we see Ryle presented as, not a bad person, instead, only a""person who does bad things"".Now, I\'ve been thinking about this line.I wonder if it was Colleen’s intention to have Ryle say this line to purposefully show how he manipulates Lily into having this mindset or if Colleen really does think this way.Ryle is indeed a bad person, and abuser who is irredeemable. I understand and agree that it is at times, difficult to label someone as “bad” or “good” as it is more complicated than that. But there comes a point, that person is a bad person (for instance, when he tries to horrifically rape her and guilt-tripped Lily with his trauma). Colleen attempts to evoke confliction in the reader by writing in that Ryle donates to charity. Yet, this is not enough. One donation does not make you a good person, especially when compared to the severe harm that you’ve caused others. I cannot believe that after Ryle attempted to rape Lily, there are still Ryle apologists out there. That moment was absolutely mortifying.Regardless, the general plotline of this book is supposed to be that Ryle starts off as being a kind, loveable man with whom Lily and the reader fall in love with. But, his abusive and manipulative tendencies are slowly revealed until it becomes clear that he is an abuser and that this is a case of domestic abuse. However,from the beginning of the book, Ryle is already portrayed as a concerningly violent and manipulative man.We are introduced to his character when Lily finds him kicking a chair out of anger, something unacceptable and very worrying. Later on,he begs and successfully coerces Lily into having sex with him, purely and solely because he wants to.Unfortunately, at this point in the story, many people still like, possibly even love, Ryle. This is not the ""turning point"" per se.I’ve also recently seen many people criticizing Colleen Hoover’s ability to write a healthy relationship and I’m beginning to agree. Although I remember enjoying Ugly Love, it was certainly unhealthy, specifically in the way that our female main character was treated. Then I began to read ""November 9"" and was utterly mortified by the way Ben, our love interest, acted. There are plenty of reviews with quotes etc. that show how horribly and scarily Ben treated Fallon from the beginning, before the plot twist.So, I conclude that Colleen’s failure to properly structure a base for the story to build upon was a main concern.In regards to Ryle’s trauma,it is something that he weaponizes to manipulate and guilt-trip Lily.It does not excuse the abuse and I think it’s gravely concerning for people to blame the abuse on his trauma. Although it’s understandable to feel bad for what he had to go through, it is all used to manipulate and abuse Lily.Then we have Atlas. When I first read this book, I was quite taken with how caring and sweet Lily and Atlas’ childhood romance seemed to be. But upon reflection, I’ve become more and more concerned by Atlas’ presence in this book at all.I’ve seen countless girls swooning over the“I know it wasn’t a pity fuck, Lily. I was there”line, yetAtlas had sex with Lily while she was a minor.I question why Colleen Hoover would choose to make it that way. It’s extremely unnecessary and the illegality of it could have been easily avoided had she chosen for them to be the same age.This again shows Colleen’s inability to write healthy relationships.Furthermore, I found that the side romance in general greatly took away from the purpose of the book.The fact that Lily had to be saved by another man is truly a damaging thing to portray. Many women who experience domestic abuse do not have the option to leave just because there is a better man out there and it’s also damaging to make it seem that Lily is simply picking between Ryle or Atlas.Moreover, this expands my discontent with howColleen chose to shove in aspects of her usual work to something so serious.A side love story was truly unnecessary for this, but I believe Colleen knew that if she wrote something without romance, it would not sell. Can I blame her for that? I’m not quite sure, but it certainly does not please me.Deriving from what I’ve mentioned so far, particularly about Ryle,it bothers me how little conclusion Colleen offers at the end of the book.I have had to have conversation after conversation with people who misinterpreted the book, who still forgive Ryle and who think of “It Ends With Us” as a romance book. For a while, my challenge question (for friend requests) was “What is your favourite (dark) romance book and why?” And I cannot tell you the number of times people answered with “It Ends With Us”. Some people write in their reviews that even though Ryle was not Lily’s ultimate partner and just because it “did not work out”, they will still have love for Ryle in their heart and think that he just needs help. And unfortunately, I don’t think these people are to blame.With Colleen still allowing Ryle to have custody, it almost allows for a small redemption for his character. And I believe at the end of the book, Colleen should have written one page with the cycle of abuse and how it was shown throughout the novel, and a conclusion expressing that if you love Ryle,you should not,because everything that he did, he did itconsciously and with purpose, through manipulation and guilt-tripping(weaponizing his trauma). I do appreciate however, that she included the domestic abuse hotlines.I also thinkit is unacceptable for people to be recommending this book as just a “sad book” or a “book to make you cry”, becausediminishing a book that explores such a difficult and serious topic like domestic abuse, to an object that simply serves the purpose of evoking emotions from you, is extremely disrespectful and shallow.Especially considering that this is such a personal book to Colleen Hoover.Another thing that I found to be really damaging about this book isthe audience.There is this#coquetteaesthetic on tiktok that I am sure you are aware of. I really to like the look of it etc. But it is a theme among this aesthetic to read books like ""It Ends With Us"" and ""Lolita"". I believe both of these texts are greatly misinterpreted, especially considering that it is often young girls who are reading these books from the ages of 11-15. Ignoring Lolita as that is a different topic,I am nearly certain that these girls buy books like “It Ends With Us” purely for the cover.It\'s pink. And it fits the aesthetic.I see people saying that they ""love"" “It Ends With Us” and I find it greatly concerning. What do you love about it? I see people ignoring Lily\'s plotline and just adoring Atlas and his whole ""I know it wasn\'t a pity fuck, Lily. I was there."" They\'ve transformed this as something to romanticise. Not to mention thatI also see girls giggle at what seems to be a little inside joke of theirs when they quote""where did you get the magnet lily""or""you fell down the stairs"".I am really beginning to think that this book has done more harm than good.The writing wasn’t something I had a problem with.When I see people criticize Colleen Hoover, it tends to be becausethey call her writing “wattpad writing” which is stupid, because people will say that any contemporary romance has “wattpad writing”.That’s not a great criticism, they should actually elaborate. Other than the quotes that I’ve disagreed with like“There’s no such thing as a bad person, only people who do bad things”, I found that Colleen Hoover’s writing flows well and that she has some iconic, well thought out quotes.I wasn’t a huge fan of Lily writing her letters to Ellenand I didn’t really care at first, but in the Acknowledgement section of “It Ends With Us”, Colleen actually says thankyou to Ellen DeGeneres saying that she is“light when it comes to darkness”. Considering what an awful person everyone knows that Ellen is, I again struggle to understand why Colleen chose this specific detail when she could have chosen someone that was a much better person and influence. *I have been informed that because this book was written in 2016, Ellen was not known to be a bad person,although I still question Colleen\'s decision to make Lily write letters to a talk show host.Veering off that topic and coming back to my problems with Ryle, is thatI strongly despised how he cared for Lily when she was pregnant.I felt that Ryle cared more about the baby than Lily, and it continues to portray women as baby machines who are made to serve a purpose.The way he cared for her stomach and touched her stomach rather than her. It’s disgusting.Something that also boiled my blood isthe internal misogynythat I see Colleen weave into her books.Lily chooses to not decide whether to divorce Ryle or not until after she has the baby becauseshe believes that her decision would be affected by her hormones.What the fuck?????? Was the fact that he tried to rape you and then he beat you not clear enough?Furthermore, when Lily is trying to explain to Ryle that she wants to divorce him, she tells him something along the lines of“what if this baby girl came home to you and told you ‘daddy, this boy hits me but he apologized and said he wouldn’t do it again’, what if she came home with bruises”, and only then does that garner any sympathy from Ryle.This situation parallels the instances when men only feel remorse for things like sexual assault when they are told ‘what if it was your mother and sister’.It’s horrible and it made me deeply upset that I’ve seen reviews admiring how Ryle was “understanding” after Lily explained that to him.I believe Lily was a strong character to a degree and I agreed with the way she responded to certain things (or I would have done the same), but there are times where I would have been gone, and Lily stayed (like when Ryle begged her for sex). Still, you can really tell she did have a certain level of logic and reason, and tried to confront Ryle.Something that really bugged me was the characterDevinand how Colleen Hoover writes him asthegay stereotype.He\'s overly touchy with Lily, touching her breasts and pulling down her bra without her consent. This is truly such a disgusting and rude way to portray characters of the lgbtq+ community, especially considering that Colleen Hoover rarely diversifies her books(very few poc + lgbtq characters). It mainly frustrates me because Colleen Hoover clearly has a huge income from the sales of her books, and that she cannot be bothered to get sensitivity readers or better editors for these things is so concerning.Another thing that was kind of unnecessary was this line:“A 2-year-old girl will have the same name even when she’s 22, Lily Bloom. Names aren’t something we eventually grow out of.”I understand the meaning behind this sentence, suggesting that parents should put thought into their children\'s names, and that it should suit an adult as much as a child. But I also understand that this can be seen as quite inconsiderate towards transgender people, and just people who change their names in general, because that\'s obviously possible too.There are just so many things that could have been easily avoided, and for these things to not be noticed and fixed is quite lazy of the author.Despite my problems with this book, I think the general idea that Colleen Hoover tried to present in this book was executed decently well at times, hence my two stars.This is a very difficult read, especially if you relate to any of it at all so please do check trigger warnings and be careful because it can be very uncomfortable to see yourself in someone like Lily, or in her position. Much love to anyone who has been through anything like this, I hope you’re okay <3━━━━━━━━━━━ ♡ ━━━━━━━━━━━'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""::: SPOILER-FREE REVIEW :::Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we’ll never get back.HOLY WOW!It Ends With Usis one of the mostpowerfulbooks of 2016 and one of the most raw, honest, inspiring, and profoundly beautiful stories I've ever read. It wasn’t anything like what I expected, but it delivered so much more than I ever hoped for. This is the kind of book that I want to give to every woman and just be like… READ THIS BOOK. NOW. Come to think of it, all the men should read it too. EVERYONE should read this book. Absolutely everyone. It's a story of unshakable love and finding the strength to make the right choice in the hardest situation. I honestly don't think I've ever been prouder of a heroine. I've loved Colleen Hoover's books for a long time because she always writes unique stories... and this one left a lasting mark on my heart. It is a MUST-READ!!This is a completelyspoiler-free review. I'm not even going to add the blurb or tell you what this book is about. It's a Colleen Hoover book. That should be enough to tell you it's amazing. But I really feel that you should just dive into this book without knowing anything about the plot. To be honest, I'm the usually the kind of reader who likes to know every little thing about what to expect in advance, but I've really learned to trust Colleen's writing and her storytelling so even I went into this book without knowing anything at all... and I was blown away by the story!This book isunputdownable. You'll notice as you read that there are no good stopping points. None at all. I began reading it late at night and every time I tried to put it down to go to sleep, I just had to get back up and keep reading because I couldn't stop thinking about it. I didn't finish until almost 5AM but my gosh was it ever worth it!Of all the heroines I've ever read, Lily was most certainly one of the ones I admired the most. I knew loved her from the first few pages, but having finished the book, I truly couldn't be prouder of her. Her strength and conviction over the course of this story made her into a heroine I'd want every girl and woman to read about and look up to. She was so real and vulnerable as we all are, but the strength with which she took control of her life was admirable on such a deep level. I just wanted to hug her and cheer. I don't think I've been this proud of a fictional character before.There's an incrediblypowerful messagein this book that is very subtly woven in from the start. It begins in the first chapter, but you don't yet realize howsignificanteach of these moments truly are... and as you read more, these pieces of the story come together forming a scenario that gives such a raw, honest portrayal of an incredibly relevant issue. I'm not mentioning it on purpose because I don't want you to expect it.The fact that it's unexpected for you as the reader is very important because it's also unexpected for the heroine.As she begins to realize what kind of situation she's in, so do you. And this realization very much allows you to experience her journeywithher.The only thing I want to address head on is the question of the 'love triangle' because a few of you have read the blurb and have asked about it. All I want to say is to please try and move away from that thought. I don't want to spoil the plot at all, but that is so not what this book is about. That is not the point, or the focus. Whatever it is you're thinking this book is, just trust me -- it's so much bigger than that. Seriously, trust Colleen. I did.As a romance reader, I found this book incredibly refreshing. As much as I adore the romance genre (and I really do), it sometimes can get a little repetative. As both an avid reader and a blogger, I'm always looking for books that step outside the lines a little; ones that do something different or take the issues a little deeper. This book represented exactly what I wish I could be reading all the time -- not this literal story, but just the fact that it went in such a different direction and gave me such an unexpected story that left me with such a strong message.One of the things that intrigued me the most and had me wondering when I heard about this book was what the title really meant -- and there's this very specific moment when the title is echoed in the story that just had such astrongimpact as I read it. That was my cheer moment. I just sat back and went 'woah!'. The title is truly perfect.In order to write this review, I went back over the book a second time and one thing I noticed strongly was how many intricate layers there were to the story that I couldn't possibly have known about in my first read. I loved that this is one of those books you experience differently (in a good way) both the first and second time though.I have to say that this book would make aseriously amazing movie. I could picture every scene so clearly as I read. This is also such an incredibly relevant story for many people -- whether they've personally been through what happened to Lily or they know of someone who has -- so I really do hope that one day this makes it to the big screen.My copy of this book is literally filled with highlighted quotes in every single chapter but I made a conscious decision not to add any to this review because I really truly do not want to give anything away about the story. Just trust me and jump into this story blind. I promise that it is a reading experience you don't want to miss.This began as one of my most highly anticipated books of 2016 and it is now of my top favorite books of the year. I was unable to put it down from the moment I started reading and I know that this is one of those profoundly beautiful and unforgettable stories that will stay with me for a long time. I highly recommend it toeveryone!That’s what fifteen minutes can do to a person. It can destroy them.It can save them.Rating: 5+ STARS!

My name is Kelly . . . .Also, I spoil things, so back away quickly if you don’t want this one to be ruined for you.My glaring 1 Star in a sea of 5s probably makes it pretty clear that I detested this book, but please refrain from fetching your torches and pitchforks for a moment and take note that not only did Ijust 5 Star a CoHo Story two weeks ago(as well as shoved it down everyone’s throats I possibly could), but also I want to make all of the sexuals with Miles Archer and will fight anyone for dibs on his imaginary lurv making. I didn’t pick this up in order to hate on it. I’m one of you . . . . sometimes. Definitely not this time, but lots of times. And this is why I don’t ever give up on Hoover novels. I never know how I’m going to react.Allow me to explain what went wrong for me with this one . . .Let’s start with the obvious annoyances that seem to be in nearly every NA book that drive me batshit before getting to the real nitty gritty. First, the character names. Ryle, Lily Bloom and Atlas???????Is it against the law tonotuse absolutely ridiculous (™Ron2.0) names in these books????Second . . . .“Your lips. I love how they’re as red as your hair.”According to Google (all hail Google) less than 2% of the world’s population has red hair, and yet 99.998% of all NA leading ladies do. Just stahp.Third, non-existent chemistry. In this story Lily and Ryle meet by chance on a rooftop after experiencing respective miserable days. In a matter of minutes Lily goes from worrying the stranger on the roof could be a psycho killer/rapist to getting into his super sexy (NOT) pick-up lines . . .“If you wouldn’t sleep with someone you just met . . .” His eyes meet mine again. “Exactly how far would you go?”Ewww. She already said thanks but no thanks freakshow so STFU.Now let’s move on to the real big issue. I took a gander at my friends’ reviews before I started typing this and noticed my buddyChelseawas the only other naysayer in the batch. She summed it upperfectlywhen she talked about the massive amounts of emotional manipulation that was forced down the readers’ throats in order to make them feel all the things.It’s a running joke with my friends/family/co-workers that I have a robot heart. And for the majority of the time it’s true. I generally experience two emotions – happiness and annoyance. But even a robot like me can be manipulated into having a feeling/crying the ugly tears like a Kardashian once in a blue moon (*coughMe Before Youcough*). This time, though? It was like a flashing neon sign . . . .To begin with, our first leading male Atlas is a homeless teenager who Lily befriends/eventually loses her virginity. In case you don’t get the writing on the wall, Atlas is being set up as the most perfect perfection that ever perfected. He’s also the way to getting the “raised in an abusive household” plotline uncovered. Like in all NA stories, Atlas and Lily are torn apart. Lily moves on with her life, graduates college, yada yada, and, as mentioned above, meet-cutessuper creeperMr. Right 2.0 on the roof. Mr. Right 2.0 is not only another most perfect perfection that ever perfected, but he’s alsorichand aneurosurgeonand very obviously husband material even though he’s never had a girlfriend (also after dating only six months),annnnnnnnddue to their mutually busy schedules not really knowing the guy.It wasn’t too hard to see where the story was going to go (and no, I hadn’t been spoiled because I didn’t read any reviews or the synopsis, I just auto-request everything by Hoover from both NetGalley and the library). Basically this was a story about domestic abuse and making excuses not only the first time he knocks your ass down “on accident” but also the second time when you wake up after “falling” down the stairs and hearing his sob story about a superbadawful that effed him up as a kid and then agreeing on a policy where“When you’re upset, just walk away. And I’ll walk away”(becauseTHAT’Sgoing to fucking work) and then saying“It’s okay, Ryle. It’s okay. You were angry, it’s okay”and making sure even when you’re bleeding profusely out of your fucking skull and are concussed and have quite possibly just been raped by your own damn husband that you get taken to an emergency room in a hospital other than the one where your bastard abuser works in order to protect his ass as well as explaining“sometimes the reason women go back is simply because they’re in love”and in case all that wasn’t e-fucking-nough you add in a whoopsie baby (another NA per usual) to serve as the wake-up call that maybe it’d be a good idea to ditch this zero and eventually find you a hero,buuuuuuuuuuuutyou just come to an agreement regarding visitation and whathaveyou rather than involving the court and much needed supervised interaction because youknowhe wouldn’t hurt the baby since it’s obvious he loves her . . . .Nope.I’m well aware I’m going against the grain here. I give zero fucks. Don’t bother trolling me to tell me how stupid I am (especially if you’re a teenager who has lived a privileged lifestyle and never experienced anything contained in this book for yourself). I went to the wholesale club yesterday and stocked up on big ol’ batch of . . . .I will be using it freely.Many thanks to the library for having nearlyeverybook I ever want to read – especially books like these that are only approved to fangirling 5 Star reviewers prior to publication.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""5 + brave and bold stars!!!Want the naked truth aboutIt Ends with Us? Reading this book will change your life. It’s so different from any of Colleen Hoover’s other books. You can tell it’s heavier, more personal, just more. This book is deep. It’s profound. It’s a book that needs to be read. I'll repeat:THIS IS A BOOK THAT NEEDS TO BE READ!This story is moving. It will make you think about things that are uncomfortable to think about. It will lift your heart, devastate you at times, make you proud, fill you with sorrow and make you smile. It will move you. It’s powerful and intense in the best way, but also has hopeful and lighter moments. The story itself is one that has been heavy on my heart from the moment I finished it.Sometimes, I read a book and it’s so beautiful, influential and emotional I will cry just thinking about the characters and their story. Not in a bad way necessarily, I just get that moved and that emotional while thinking about it. That is this book. Trying to find the words for this review is bringing me to tears. It’s hard to explain the story completely spoiler free, but this isn’t a ‘sad’ book. It’s a strength book. Because dealing with the issues in this story took so much strength.I’m not going to talk about the actual story at all, but I will speak a bit about the characters.Lily. Speaking of strength, Lily may be the strongest heroine that I’ve read about. Your strength is really tested when you are put in a hard situation where your choices are impossible. I loved Lily so much. I was proud of Lily and the choices she made. I want to be Lily when I grow up.Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we’ll never get back.There are two men in this story, but please don’t think this is a triangle book. It’s not. It’s hard to explain, but it’s not.Ryleis a charming guy. He’s a giving person. He’s got a lot of great attributes. I’m not sure if I’ve ever felt so conflicted over a character as I did him.Atlasis the type of man I always have a soft spot for as a reader. His story gutted me at times, but he is also a character with a lot of strength and so much beauty. I loved Atlas from the second I met him and that love never stopped throughout the book.“Lily?” he whispers, looking at me sincerely. “You just might be the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”Aside from the three main characters in the story, Lily’s mom played a prominent part. Their relationship played an even bigger part. Ryle’s sister and Lily’s best friend Alyssa was one of my favorite characters in this book. When things got hard she was there. One line she said in the book, to Lily just solidified the type of woman she was. Coleen always writes that one side character that you love so hard in her stories, and Alyssa was that character for me. I can’t not mention Ellen, because, well, it’s Ellen. That part was brilliant. It made me smile every time Ellen was mentioned.When reading this book, there were moments I struggled between not being able to tear my eyes away from the page, and others I had to take a breather because I couldn't handle what was going on.Parts of this story left me so heartbroken and others lifted me up so high. There are some parts that are just so powerful I could only read them in awe. This is it. This is why I read. Books like this.All humans make mistakes. What determines a person’s character aren’t the mistakes we make. It’s how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses.Colleen Hoover is an author who truly has a way with words. She killed this book. I’ve read and loved all of CoHo’s books. Some of her earlier books are some of my all-time favorites. I’ve enjoyed all of her latest books, but this is by far the best book she’s ever written. And it’s tied withHopelessas my own personal favorite book by her. And that is saying a lot, becauseHopelessis one of my top books ever.If you only read one book this year, let it beIt Ends with Us.

We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.”I did my best not to cry. I felt sick, but I clenched my jaw and forced myself to keep reading, trying in vain to ignore the tremors that ran through my body. But when the last chapters came, and Colleen's note in the end, I couldn't take it any more. I dissolved into angry, hot tears, and I checked my chest to make sure my heart was not bleeding. Lily's story had a lot to teach. I think I died a little when I realized that sometimeslove is not enough. Regret, good will, they're not enough to fix some wounds. On the contrary, they make them deeper.“Just because someone hurts you doesn't mean you can simply stop loving them. It's not a person's actions that hurt the most. It's the love.

A part of me, a part I tried to smother, a part I am ashamed that exists, wanted him to change. To try harder, and for Lily to let him try harder. Me, who judged them for not leaving. In the end,I felt sorry for Ryle. For losing the love of his life, for destroying his only chance at happiness. I don't forgive him, I just wish that a magic wand would make everything better.“So much gravity, pushing down on my emotions. Everything shatters.My tears, my heart, my laughter, my soul. Shattered like broken glass, raining down around me.”Lily is a hero.She haddignity, andcourageandstrength. At first I was judging her mother for staying, but witnessing through Lily's eyes her challenges, feeling her heartbreak and her dilemmas, made me regret all the ugly things I thought. Loving the person who hurts you is a greater torture than the physical act itself. And damn it I loved Ryle, and I hated Colleen for that.I hated her for making me swoon and laugh when she was about to shatter my soul.The Katerina that startedIt Ends with Usis a different person than the Katerina that finished it.

When I re-read this in prep for the new one and then diving right in to it, I feel the need to change this rating to a 2. However, I will be leaving my original review up.It Ends With Us... Wow I really don\'t know what to truly say about this novel. This review will be a little light because, like most CoHo books, you\'ll want to go into it with little to no information. I went into this book thinking it was going to be this one thing, and it turned out to be the complete opposite.IEWUfollows Lily, a girl in her early twenties, who has never had it easy. Though coming from a family that was better off she has always had to work for the things she\'s wanted. After graduating college she gets up and moves to Boston and hopes to start her own business. While there she meets and falls for Ryle, a thriving neurosurgeon who is determined to be the best in his field. The two hit it off hard, and things seem almost too good to be true. Ryle is everything that Lily is not. He is forward, assertive, and stubborn. He is also a lot of thing Lily is; he is strong, passionate, and motivated. Though the two have an immediate connections and sparks fly, the two decided to take their time getting to know one another. Lily is such a beautifully written leading lady. I loved getting to grow with her and be apart of her journey. I loved hearing her thoughts and seeing how she processed things. When I was first reading and got to the point where she does her journal entries, but she does them so they are letters to Ellen DeGeneres, I thought I wasn\'t going to like that aspect of it. The first few had me thinking ""this is a little cheesy"", but the more I got into it the more I started to enjoy them. They really tied Lily\'s past and present perfectly together. As Lily\'s and Ryle\'s relationship pushes forward she finds herself looking back at those entries and thoughts of her first love Atlas resurface. Atlas was her first everything and was the biggest impact on her life. Atlas was the homeless boy who found his way into the abandoned house next door. Atlas and Lily as teens formed an unlikely friendship. Sharing everything and having a bond that no one around them seemed to understand. Spending every possible moment together and having so many stolen ones the two were kindred spirits. When Atlas reappears in the story it truly threatens everything Lily and Ryle have. (not a spoiler it\'s given he eventually will). Both Ryle and Atlas bring such important and different aspects to this story. I think CoHo manages to make them both such polar opposites, but at the same time manages to make them mesh so well.The characters in the book, main or side, all feel so realistic and authentic.When it comes to the plot there is almost nothing I can say about it. I hope everyone will do the same to keep things from getting spoiled. The story is an emotional roller coaster from start to finish. It\'s one of those books that you will have a thousand theories about and all of them will be wrong. I kept trying to guess what I thought might happen next and in classic Hoover style she managed to surprise me. This book was solid from page one and was steady throughout, but around the 80% mark is where things really took a turn (in the best way possible).IEWUhit me on such a personal level. I didn\'t expect this book to impact me so hard. It had everything I wanted from a New Adult read. It\'s very classic CoHo, but it also branches out somewhere she\'s never been before, but she does it with such ease. She manages to weave these heavy moments with ones that will make you swoon, laugh, and then cry. My favorite part of this book though, was the author\'s note. Usually author\'s notes are at the beginning of the story, however it is so important that this one was left for the end. It took a book that was good and made it exceptional! God, this note effected me like so few books have. It made me cry fifty times harder than the entire book or anything Colleen\'s ever written.Finding out how important this book was for her to write will hit you hard, but I hope she also knows how important it is as a reader to read. Knowing where an author gets their ideas from can change your whole outlook on a book, and this one... this one broke me.Thank you Colleen Hoover for continuing to gift the reading community with your words.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Dear Colleen,I find it fitting that I write this review as a letter to you the way Lily would write to Ellen. Don\'t ask me why, I really don\'t know. What I do know is that I haven\'t been on Goodreads in nearly six months and it\'s entirely your fault that i\'m here now. So, if i stumble upon a poor review on one of my books and end up in the fetal position on my kitchen floor surrounded by Ding Dong wrappers, well, I\'m blaming it on you. I\'ve even given my husband instructions to bill you for the psychiatry bill if that happens.On Friday I had a hysterectomy. It wasn\'t the worst day of my life, but it certainly wasn\'t the best. One chapter of my life--quite possibly the best chapter--ended. The surgery itself took twenty minutes. Twenty minutes. Can you believe that? Twenty minutes to take out the uterus that carried my three beautiful babies for a total of twenty eight months. Twenty minutes to change my life. Don\'t feel bad for me, that\'s not what I want. The offending organ had to come out, I knew this. But it didn\'t make it any easier. It didn\'t make the finality of the situation any easier. In all honesty, for a couple of minutes I didn\'t just feel like a chapter was ending, more like an entire flipping book. Maybe my life isn\'t made up of chapters, maybe it\'s part of a duet, or a trilogy? Either way, part of my story was over.Over a matter of several hours, I slowly woke up from surgery and at one point I remember sitting there and just staring at the wall paper in my hospital room.My uterus was gone.Mauve diamonds.The wallpaper was covered in mauve diamonds.That\'s the most hideous color, don\'t you think? Mauve. Not quite pink. Not quite maroon.I counted seven hundred and fifty three diamonds before I allowed the first tear to fall. But I wasn\'t just crying for losing a part of my body, and I wasn\'t crying for losing the ability to carry more children. I was crying because some women don\'t even get to experience what I\'ve gotten to experience. Some women never get to have babies. They never get to feel them grow in their bellies. They never get to see the slimy little monsters as they tumble their way into this world.And I did.I got to do all of that three times.So why was I so upset? What the hell was my problem? I should be grateful, right? Happy?My husband slept soundly in the chair, snoring softly, but at some point my cries must have woken him up. He stirred and I did the only thing I could do ... I grabbed your book. You see, it was sitting on my bedside table. I buried my nose between the pages and when my better half asked me if I was okay I simply peeked over the top of the book and whispered, ""Colleen. She did it again.""I didn\'t need to say much more, he knows my obsession with your words and I found myself grateful. Grateful that he knew your books make me cry and grateful that you inadvertently allowed me to grieve. And that\'s what I did. I read your book and I grieved. I cried when Lily cried. I cried when Ryle cried. And even when no one was crying, I still cried simply because I needed to and I could and no one thought twice about it because i was reading and that\'s what i do when i read. It was my outlet, my excuse for the tears that wouldn\'t go away, the tears that kept falling despite my desperate protest.I cried for all of the Lily\'s in the world, and the Ryle\'s too. I cried for the Atlas\'. And I cried for the Kirby\'s (that\'s my name. No i\'m not named after a vacuum, or a cream puff)But you see, I didn\'t want to cry. I didn\'t want to be upset. I have three beautiful children whom I love with my entire heart. My body did it\'s job extremely well and that is something to be proud of. But why wasn\'t I proud?Naked truth?I\'m selfish.I wanted one more baby even though my husband didn\'t. I wanted one more baby when there are women out there that can\'t have any at all.So why am I telling you this? My story is nothing like Lily\'s. Not even close.But maybe it is ...She wanted something she shouldn\'t want. I wanted something I couldn\'t have. She had a decision to make ... one that would change her life. So did I. She made a decision that was right for her and for her life at that particular time.Ditto.But the real reason I\'m telling you this is because for two days I was drowning and It Ends With Us was my lifeline. It\'s what I grabbed when I needed to stop thinking ... it\'s what I grabbed when i needed to cry ... and when i finally finished the book and put it down, it wasn\'t mauve diamonds that I saw ... it was my smiling children.My three beautiful smiling children ... and my niece Lily.-- Kirby'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '""We all have a limit. What we\'re willing to put up with before we break.""When was the last time a book just completely slayed me, cutting me so deep and evoking such strong emotions? It feels like my heart has been filled, then broken, filled, then broken. In the end, I\'m stunned by what I read.It Ends with Usstarts out innocently enough. We follow the courtship of Lily and Ryle. He is handsome, successful, and so thoroughly smitten with Lily he can barely think. He makes advances while claiming he doesn\'t do relationships. She rebuffs him while secretly pining for him. Really, it\'s all fun and a bit frivolous, your standard romance.But then we arrive at the crux of this story, which I\'ll try my best to be vague here so as to minimize the spoilage. (Though at this point, with all the hubbub surrounding the movie, I\'d be surprised if there is anyone out there who doesn\'t yet know what this is about.) Nonetheless, it\'s best to read it from Colleen Hoover\'s own words, and what an astounding set of words they are.Make no mistake, this isn\'t a romance even though it starts out as one. Instead, it\'s a considerably more honest look at relationships—their ups and downs, and what really happens when the rosy tint wears off and it turns out one person has bigger issues than the relationship can contain. As a result, it asks us readers the very uncomfortable question of just how much we are willing to put up with for love.I will say, the main topic in here is something that a lot of books try to tackle, but very few do right. Often books will go heavy-handed in making one character out to be the villain, as if afraid that a more subtle approach will somehow be misconstrued as condonement. But this does a disservice to the entire situation, making it difficult for us to understand the other character\'s perspective as well as their reasons for being in the relationship in the first place.What makes Hoover\'s portrayal so masterful is her nuanced approach. She brings a humanity to both sides that is sobering and heartbreaking, and it makes the whole thing ring true. It\'s brutal and compelling, and it\'s hard to look away.I think for those of us fortunate enough to never have been in a situation like this, it\'s easy to take the ideal road and turn our noses up at anything less than the puritanical view. But real life isn\'t like that at all; it isn\'t black and white. It\'s filled to the brim with all sorts of gray, day in and day out. And Hoover shades in the gray with a skillfulness that is so raw and visceral, it often made me forget where my lines are.Many people think that Hoover is romanticizing what is going on in here, but that isn\'t it at all. In making Ryle the complex person that he is with good qualities, and in making Ryle and Lily\'s relationship happy most of the time, Hoover actually manages to explain the most confounding paradox of abusive relationships—that they are good or even great most of the time, and that the victim is neither too dumb to realize they\'re being mistreated nor are they too lazy to affect change. But rather, the victim needs to be exceptionally strong and well-supported in order to leave behind so many good moments in order to cut out a few bad ones.I read this book years ago when it first came out, and I remember thinking highly of it, though not much else. So when I read it again this time, I admit I was shaken by how hard it hit me. I think it\'s because I\'m older now and have more experience with love and relationships, so I\'m able to appreciate this story even more.My suggestions if you\'re going to read this book—have a box of tissues ready and don\'t skip the author\'s note at the end. I sobbed my way to the finishing line, then read the author\'s note and sobbed some more. This is a riveting and worthwhile read, though at times difficult, and it showcases Colleen Hoover at her best, taking her contemporary new adult genre and elevating it to soaring heights.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:It Starts with UsVerityReminders of HimRegretting YouUgly LoveLayla~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Preventing your heart from forgiving someone you love is actually a hell of a lot harder than simply forgiving them.4 1/2 stars.Holy crap, what a book.This is unlike anything Hoover has written before. I have so many emotions right now that it\'s hard to know where to start, but I think everyone should read this book. That\'s right: everyone.I could easily give everything away. I could, but I won\'t. If you go looking for lots of reviews, it won\'t be hard to work out whatIt Ends with Usis about. And if you do, you should still read it, but I think it\'s better if you don\'t. I think you should go into this book knowing as little as possible. Just realize that this is something very different from Hoover\'s usual new adult romances (that I admittedly have hadallkindsofproblemswith).So I don\'t want to say too much, but this is anextremely powerful storyand it\'s not what most people will be expecting. It gets its power from the singular first person narrative (I\'m honestly not a big fan of the alternating male/female POV romances) and we experience everything through Lily\'s eyes. When she falls in love, we fall in love; when her heart is broken, our heart is broken; when she gets it all wrong, so do we.I cannot stress how important anddamn smartthis book is. There is no black and white characterization - it\'s much deeper and more complex than that, and therefore, far more emotional.It peels back the layers of characters and relationships to do something that so many other authors have tried and failed to do - to make you understand a situation that for most people makes no sense. It\'svery sad, painful and exceptionally honest. My heart hurt while reading it and I almost cried several times.As well as all this emotion and sadness that I\'m being coy about, Hoover also brings out some of her very best writing. Little gems of honesty about human nature and relationships that are all the more painful because of their resounding truth. It\'s such a quotable book, but unfortunately most of the quotes are spoilers, so I shall refrain from posting them.There\'s so many great things to mention, but I keep getting distracted by myfeelings. The narrative is interspersed with letters that Lily wrote as a teenager and they are addressed to Ellen Degeneres - a strange touch that ends up being absolutely perfect. Shit, just writing this review and remembering the story is an emotional experience.And then there\'s theabsolutely fantastic female friendship. I want Allysa to be my best friend. Hoover clearly knows her audience of 16-25 year old women, creating characters with their quirks and habits - Allysa, for example, is a self-confessed ""Pinterest whore"", which made me laugh. But seriously, she is the best friend ever and she says one of the most perfect lines in this book.Anyway, I\'m just going to start rambling soon because I read this book in a whirlwind of emotions throughout a single day. I\'ve been up since a ridiculous time and I need to go sleep now. But really, give this book a chance. I thought it was excellent.Trigger Warnings:Domestic abuse (physical, occasionally graphic).

I promise.""I\'m convinced anyone who gives this five stars is not sane. It contains the typical ~ I don\'t do marriage~ love interest, but somehow, he magically wants a committed relationship and kids with our lucky lady after a few interactions. We love being the only exception. It ends with us contains a lot of dark elements such as abuse, toxic relationships, and attempted rape. I understand this novel is based on the author\'s experience, but that doesn\'t mean it\'s good, nor am I obligated to like it. There\'s absolutely no justification for abuse, and why Lily continues to stay is beyond my comprehension. Throwing away your morals just because someone is hot has got to be the stupidest thing ever.The author added numerous poor book decisions; I\'ll list some of them here:1) The main character\'s full name is Lily Blossom Bloom, and she runs a florist shop. Do I need to say more?2) Lily is obsessed with Ellen Degeneres to the point where Ellen becomes the 4th main character of the story.3) Ryle knocked on 29 apartment doors simply to find Lily and proceeded to beg on his knees for her to fuck him.4) Lily\'s bedroom light turned on at the exact perfect moment, just as Atlas was about to commit suicide. Wow, what a mere coincidence. He thought she was an angel beaming in the light. He said, and I quote""I ~felt~ something,""that\'s the reason why he didn\'t want to kill himself anymore.5) Every repetitive""just keep swimming""reference.6) Ryle put a big picture of Lily on his wall after their first meeting. Was this supposed to be attractive?7) The typical let\'s invite my gay best friend as my date to make Ryle jealous, only for the gay best friend never to reappear again. I smell a plot device.8) This quote >>""There\'s no such thing as bad people, just people who do bad things.""9) Atlas slept with 16-year-old Lily when he was a legal adult.10) Lily names her daughter Dory after the fish in Finding Nemo.11) Colleen Hoover has the most unhinged sentences:""When he was wiping that cow shit on me, it was quite possibly the most turned-on I have ever been.""I do, however, understand the valuable and worthwhile message it sends. It\'s difficult to leave someone you love in such situations, which are never black and white. It is so hard that you come up with excuses and can even make the truth sound like made-up lies. I previously stated that I couldn\'t understand why Lily never left Ryle after the first incident of assault happened. It contradicts what I said just now about the author\'s message, but that\'s because I\'ve never understood their chemistry. Lily said she couldn\'t leave because she loved him too much, which was strange. It was merely a case of physical attraction. There\'s also no reason for the author to randomly throw a bunch of serious topics (homelessness, guilt, infertility, abuse, suicidal thoughts) just for the sake of making the book forcefully emotional and not going more in-depth about them. Furthermore, I was not too fond of the plot and didn\'t connect with a single character. I don\'t understand why Ryle didn\'t get help, especially when he could do things similar to their daughter or another partner. That man better stay the hell away from me, or I will seal him up in a trash bag and hit him to the moon with a baseball bat. In conclusion, I will never touch another Colleen Hoover book.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'My additional thoughts on the book adaptation and my movie review:I love Colleen Hoover so much, I’d probably even read her shopping list if she published it—her perfect blend of angst and tear-jerking emotion always gets me! I also really enjoyed the movie—the performances were strong, the emotional depth was moving, and the powerful, liberating message against domestic violence truly resonated with me.However, I can’t stand the ongoing feud between the lead actors. It needs to end! They need to make peace, especially with the It Starts with Us sequel coming up. It’s time to put the drama behind them and focus on what’s next for the fans.Here are my thoughts on the movie:https://medium.com/@niluferyozmekik/i...———————-Oh my! Argh! This is me confronting my ripped apart heart pieces after reading this book! Actually, I read the book a long time ago. I was too scared to write a review because writing meant opening up about my feelings. This book hurt me a lot, and I couldn’t find the right words to describe the “hurt” it gave me.Honestly, this is my longest Coelho reading because I put it down several times. I got pissed! I screamed! I clenched my fists so hard! I cursed the entire family tree of Ryle Kinkaid! I haven’t wanted to hire contract torturers to kidnap a character and give them the punishment they deserved for so long.The things he did to Lily—the physical and emotional abuse—were impossible for me to absorb. I felt breathless and gave up several times. This book sledgehammered my heart and crushed my soul!I returned to my reading because the beautiful love story between Atlas and Lily was like seeing sunshine through dark clouds, giving me the only hope I could hold onto. I honestly thought of only reading the flashbacks to warm my heart!What if they had reconnected that night when they accidentally met again at the restaurant? What if Lily had gone back to him instead of choosing a path with Ryle? That scenario made me so happy, but it would never be the same without the tremendous angst Coelho threw at us because she is an expert at bringing out the dirtiest, ugliest cries of regular human beings! And without pain and suffering, so much sadness, we don’t feel like we’re reading an actual Coelho story, do we? Never!This book is being developed into a screenplay! It’s so compelling to read this heart-stabbing, soul-sledgehammering story without consuming tons of paper products to dry the tears we may shed. I cannot imagine how the movie will affect me. But sometimes words hurt more than actions, and I’m sure no screenwriter has the ability to reflect all the emotions Coelho made us feel during our reads.So my advice: stock up on all the paper products from grocery stores, lock yourself in a soundproof room so as not to scare your neighbors with your screams and howling sounds, and give your entire concentration to this lyrical, insanely heartfelt story.It’s one of the most compelling, sad, and sensational Coelho books. I could hardly digest the emotional turmoil it gave me! But it’s worth the pain. Especially that meaningful, sentimental, poetic ending melted my heart.I made some adjustments for clarity and flow, while preserving the original emotions and tone.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'I don’t believe in disliking things just because they are popular. I went into this with the intention of liking it, but ended up feeling uncomfortable by the tone of this book. Although I wholeheartedly respect the personal nature of this story, the author’s note does not exempt this work of fiction from criticism, especially when it comes to a topic as serious as domestic abuse.I empathize with the main character Lily and I appreciate the effort that was made to highlight how trauma distorts and lingers, but I don’t believe this captured the severity or nuance that a topic this heavy deserves in fictionalized work. This book is marketed as romance, and the synopsis makes it seem like a lighthearted love triangle instead of a woman’s experience with spousal abuse. In comparison to Kate Elizabeth Russell’s harrowing depiction of abuse inMy Dark Vanessa, the tone ofIt Ends With Usfeels acutely inappropriate. It reduces domestic abuse to a lovers quarrel and presents a tactless caricature of the realities of abuse. I can acknowledge this may not have been the intention, but the elaboration in the authors note does not absolve this book of its reckless and irresponsible marketing.It Ends With Ushas the bones of a powerful story but reads like a low budget Hallmark movie pushed forward by ridiculous plot revelations. Hoover’s attempt to make Ryle into a three dimensional character completely flops. At first, I thought the accelerated relationship between Ryle and Lily was meant to emphasize how witnessing abuse in early age might make you less likely to spot red flags in others; however, it turns out Hoover was really trying to create a deep relationship between these two. Her use of “Naked Truth” to build their relationship was a lazy ploy to circumvent true development and simulated an unsatisfying and unearned intimacy. I also found the use of teenage diary entries in the form of letters to Ellen DeGeneres to have aged really badly, and comes off as a corny device to tell rather than show readers about Lily’s relationship with Atlas.The single redeeming quality of this book is the empathy that Lily develops for her mother towards the end, but this moment, as well as the ending, lacks sufficient nuance. I wanted more discussion, I wanted more development, and I wanted less telling and more showing. Although the message that the cycle of abuse “ends with us” is personal for Hoover, I feel like this depiction is reductive and makes it seem like walking away is a choice all women have. Hoover maintains that this book was meant to show that domestic abuse isn’t black and white, but I don’t think it achieved that at all. She made the conscious decision to pit romance and abuse against each other, packaged it with a pink cover, a synopsis free of any mention of abuse, and marketed it to impressionable young adults. However well intentioned this cathartic passion project was, its reception as a work of fiction is devout of nuance, the white knight message ofIt Ends With Uscompletely undercut by its blatant romanticism of abuse.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""this book sends a really important and worthwhile message, but it's not necessarily enjoyable.IT ENDS WITH US was not what i expected it to be. i started the novel knowing next to nothing about the storyline except that it's a colleen hoover book (NA romance) and that it'sgood(my friends kept raving). but if i'm being honest, i wasa little disappointed.i was hoping for a light read with lots of ~FEELZ~ but instead i got something much more intense – not bad, just unexpected.the main plot revolves around abusive and toxic relationships within families. it really opened my eyes to the emotions of those in these types of situations and helped me gain a lot of perspective. because of this, i think it's important to read this, but it's not enjoyable. it's definitely a really frustrating process to read.for the majority of this novel, i DIDN'T like it. i was definitely interested and curious, but i didn't care for the characters as much as i thought i would. i was frustrated and annoyed at the situations, and some of it felt artificial, rushed, and stereotypical. it all seemed so... fictional. usually the romance satisfies me, but even that didn't do it. buuuuuut it wasn't so much that i didn't NOT like it. it was simply okay when i expected it to be ~amazing~.there were two romantic tropes that bothered me because i don't like the tropes themselves and because i didn't think it was executed THAT well: insta-love and love triangle.ryle was too good to be true; a hot, young, smart, compassionate, arrogant, sensitive, rich guy suddenly appears and falls head over heels for our main character. they – somehow!! – meet again and this time he's literally BEGGING to have sex with her. suddenly, this fuckboi wants to be in a committed relationship and plans on having kids with our lucky lady. um......... okay????? i didn't feel anything for their relationship and ryle seemed like a plot device to me. and when she didn't leave him the first time, i knew i KNEW he would do much worse again. and i didn't feel surprised when it happened; i didn't feel surprised when she asked for the divorce – a little relieved maybe, but not surprised.then there's atlas, who i felt had more depth than ryle and lily but also not thaaaat much. he was probably my favorite character, but i felt his story (the letters) were kinda.. anti-climactic? their relationship was confusing to decipher, but i still loved them. it made me sad to think lily didn't end up with atlas IN THE FIRST PLACE but i guess that would make the whole purpose of the book redundant.even though i didn't enjoy the process of reading this book, i'm grateful to have read it. there are some books you read for pleasure and there are some you read to gain knowledge and perspective. this is the latter.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Phenomenal!This book will make you fall in love, rip your heart out and force you to reconsider your preconceived ideas about abuse.

Everything was going great until we got introduced to ✨Lying Liz✨Don’t get me wrong, I don’t have issues when characters lie in books but at some point I think to myself “will this character ever experience consequences and will she learn?”..Spoiler warning:..........She won’t.In the beginning I was fine with Liz but over the course of the book she couldn’t stop lying to her best friend. At first she felt bad, but after the first time, she just continued lying with ease.With every lie, I hated her more and moreI don’t understand why you have to lie about everything. And yes I get the entire “well she was scared to trust her best friend” I GET IT OKAY BECAUSE I WENT THROUGH THE EXACT SAME THING BUT WHY LIE ABOUT GOING TO A FUCKING PARTY????Let me put you into her friend’s perspective:Imagine you ask your best friend if you want to hang out, but she can’t because she has to study.Then imagine that you find out that she didn’t actually have to study but that she went to a party. How would you feel? Probably not that good.These are the lies I don’t understand. Liz could have just said she was invited to a party instead of lying because now her best friend feels like absolute shit.Yet again maybe I am too sensitive because this exact same thing happened to me but wtf.You don’t have to lie about who you hang out with. I promise it’s fine to hang out with other people just don’t fucking lie.Yet, I still had hopes for the book. I was anticipating the moments all her lies blew up into her face and that she would have to deal with the consequences.I was disappointed.Also my prediction for the future is that ✨Lying Liz✨ will return to the dark side and Wes and her will break up in college....And those, my fellow readers, are the reasons why Liz and I could never be friends.Thank you for coming to my Ted talk....This book gets a whopping 3 stars(Also for people that that this is bad, it really isn’t.

What I would give to read this book for the first time again.""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""(2.5/5)To say that I disliked this book would be somewhat of an understatement.My first problem with this book was that Liz, the main character, was absolutely infuriating. The writing read like it was a not-like-other-grills YA contemporary romance from 2010, which, honestly, except for the year, is exactly what this book is.Ever since her mother died when she was young, Liz has been obsessed with rom-coms and finding her movie-worthy happily-ever-after. Enter Michael, the neighborhood boy she was (and still is??) in love with when she was literally in kindergarten, and Wes, the infuriating boy-next-door. One of them is going to help her get the other. You know where I'm going with this.Honestly speaking, it was painful to see Liz adamantly going after Michael even after a) it seemed like fAtE wAs TrYiNg To KeEp ThEm ApArt, and b) his most appealing trait was his SoUtHeRn DrAwL. Like, umm, no thank you? And then there's the fact that Liz hadn't actually seen him or talked to him since elementary school, but was still in love with him.Seriously. Liz is better at romanticizing her life than me when I have six assignments to finish for school and three hours to do them all.It was even more painful to see how she was slowly isolating herself from everyone around her, except Wes, and how somehow, in some way, most of her problems stemmed from the fact that she never really got any closure from her mother's death. That part might have actually been tragic, but it wasn't addressed very well until the end, and everything else was annoying.Specifically, all of her gushing over Michael was just not it. I was disgusted and cringing every five minutes, to the point where I had to pause the audiobook and do history homework to attempt to burn the scenes from my mind multiple times. It was not fun, to say the least.That being said, the audiobook was actually quite good. I think I would have jumped out a window if I was actually reading this book in text format, but somehow, the audiobooks narrator's ability was enough to keep me from taking such drastic methods of escape. The narrator was magically able to keep me at least somewhat interested in the happenings of the book, and their voice is one of the two saving graces of my reading experience.The only character I could really tolerate was Wes. Poor, poor Wes. I'm going to say it right now: Wes did not deserve everything that Liz made him go through. The dude has been simping after her since they were children, and agrees to help her get another dude just because he likes spending time with her?? Get this man a medal.And maybe a back brace for carrying the entire book on his shoulders.I won't deny that Wes and Liz's relationship was cute, but at the same time, while it was developed a lot throughout the course of the book, I never felt that we were given the outcome of that development. It was always very two steps forward, three steps back with them.There were a lot of tropes both used and spoken about in this book, and I felt that they were alright, but nothing too special. The plot in general was actually quite nice, the only thing that really ruined this book for me was Liz's character herself, and her inability to communicate with literally anyone in her life.Overall, I felt that this book had a lot of potential to actually be a cute and interesting, light-hearted story. Unfortunately for us, the main character makes you want to tear your hair out and then set it on fire, even if her love-interest is the human equivalent of cotton candy. I'll be honest and say that I was expecting more, especially from the MC, but if you're able to ignore that sort of stuff, I'd definitely recommend this as a sweet, quick romance if you're looking for one.""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'The star is only for Wes'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '4.5 stars✨""Enemies-to-lovers- it\'s our trope, Buxbaum.""✔️ Enemies to lovers✔️ Fake dating✔️ Slow burn✔️ Banter and cheesy vibesY\'all am so glad I started 2024 reading this book. It\'s everything I could have asked for. I loved how cliche and cheesy it was. The whole idea of pretending to date someone to get the other guy but falling for your fake date isn\'t something new yet it was the writing that brought life to this idea.Liz and Weshad such good banter and chemistry. Their slow burn was worth sticking around. As individuals? I would prefer Wes over Liz. While Liz is a fun fmc, she is kinda too into fantasy world and delusional 😅 Whereas Wes grounded her a bit and he was making me giggle so much. Michael wasn\'t a bad side character at all but I loved Helena more. Liz\'s dynamic with Helena brought more depth to Liz, and I appreciated that.The cheesy rom com quotes were a plus. I would have preferred if the chapters had been a tad shorter, especially chapter six- why was it 60 pages long is beyond me.Also, a thing that icked me was the smoking scene,it\'s just a ""me issue"" but wasn\'t a fan of it.Other than that, I had an amazing time with it and wouldtotally recommend it,despite some of the things that I wasn\'t really appreciative of.~•~•~Thanks everyone for voting on the poll.

Each chapter began with a quote from all the rom coms I grew up on as a kid and believe they were integrated seamlessly into each chapter. This was super cute, somewhat cheesy yet fluffy but very much like a love letter to rom coms which was also obvious from the animations on the cover4.5 starsTo me, this particular YA book was portrayed incredibly realistic with certain scenarios and I was somewhat nervous to read this given mixed reviews but I’m glad I took a chance on itWES BENNETT.The famous Wes I’ve been hearing about for months didn’t disappoint. Where was he when I was 17?? I’m well into my 20s but life then would’ve been less stressful trying to understand boys lol he was so attentive, caring, funny & charming. I swooned, I was grinning, and I’d very much like an adult Wes my age thank you. His attention to detail and care, the maturity he exemplifies, seeing Liz for who she was, effortlessly just knows how to divert a negative into a positive when she’s having a bad moment/day, calls her out on her bs and is low key a rom com lover!? I could go on but ultimately he was too adorable for words and such a book bfLizwas.. a teenager and a hopeless romantic like some of us. I adored her love for music and the playlists and her love for rom coms and how it solidified the bond she had with her mom as it reminded me of mines in doing so. But, I do have to mention being annoyed with her during certain points. delusional (aren’t we all) & oblivious at times with pent up teenage angst is how I’d describe her and while it bothered me at times—I understood her. Her unresolved grief and fear of things changing molded her into how she was which isn’t an excuse but I get it. Thankfully she was self aware enough to acknowledge how wrong her words and actions were and worked to change that bc she could be so petty. When she wasn’t doing the most, her delusions had me cracking up bc I somehow related to them years ago lmao. I also tried to put myself in her shoes and remember being horrible at communicating my feelings at her age so I hope thecharacter development shown is expanded on further in the sequel“Do you realize we could’ve been doing this for years if you weren’t such a pain in the ass?”wesliz- all the teasing on Wes’ end, the phone call scene, the late night talks in his backyard, the car scene (I screamed here) and confessing their feelings was the sweetest. They weren’t remotely close to enemies to lovers but who really is lol I overall found them adorable together and I wish Liz realized that sooner. idk if they’re gonna last going to college but I cannot wait for more of them and can’t help but hope they do so don’t mind me if you seeing mereading all the extra chaptersas I simply want more of Wes and his pov 🤭 anyways this was fun! and what I needed & I’m hoping this is one day adapted as a movie since it read like onesome quotes“Enemies-to-lovers- it\'s our trope, Buxbaum.”“The universe likes Wes better.”“Wow. That dress is so Liz Buxbaum.”“Buy the dress Liz, I’m begging you” after she sends him a picture of her prom dress 🥹“She\'s not you."" “What?"" “She. Isn\'t.

(asking for a friend)After reading this, I got myself every single book Lynn Painter has ever written. I think that says a lot about how much I loved this book.I’m a fan of romance books (how Wes would say it, I’m a love lover) in theory, but in reality, they rarely satisfy my needs. So, you don’t have to trust my other reviews that much, but my reviews of romance books… I CHOOSE MY 5 STAR READS CAREFULLY IN THAT GENRE.This is considered a YA romance, characters are in their final year of high school, the events are set a few days before prom (15 if I’m correct). It’s very clean, our main couple shares a kiss or two. BUT, your needs will be satisfied. It’s all cute all fluff, the banter between Liz and Wes is written so well. The book is extremely funny, had me highlighting these little corny jokes (I laughed at them).Everything is told from the perspective of our main girl, Liz. She’s a lover of old romantic movies, which is a trait she got from her late mother. She rewatches her romcoms almost every day to sort of keep the memory of her mother. So, before every chapter, there’s a quote from one of those movies I used to obsessively watch when I was younger. Chapters were kinda long, ngl, I think the totality of this book (almost 400 pages) has less than 20 chapters (keep in mind that the last 2 were very short) + epilogue. Aside from these long chapters, there’s not a single thing I found uninteresting or dragging or cringe in this book. Reading some of the reviews for this book, I stumbled upon Liz hate. BUT I can’t really see why, to me, she was so adorable and relatable. Some of her weird behavior is easily justified by the situation she found herself in, the grief she’s going through. Both our love interests, Wes and Michael (a love triangle, not really, just read it), were very loveable. MICHAEL LOVES BRIDGERTON BOOKS, C’MON! INSTANT HEART EYES FOR THAT BOY. And Wes has everything else. He’s funny, he’s supportive (that’s his best trait), he’s humble about his achievements, truly a superior male protagonist. BOOK BOYFRIEND OF THE WEEK! Even though Liz makes that joke a couple of times throughout the book, I still wouldn’t call this the enemies-to-lovers trope. There was this tiny fight around THE parking SPOT in the beginning, but it wasn’t that serious (especially considering the explanation we got at the very end of the book). So every little bad thing Wes has potentially done was for the banter, but definitely nothing major, this man is a WALKING GREEN FLAG (can’t believe I’m saying that).Yeah, they couldn’t stay friends tho, never beating those allegations!!! 💕'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Maybe straight people aren’t so bad.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'this was not better than the movies'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""2nd ReadI love this book sm and I think it got me out of a reading/mental slump and I'm so grateful.

I feel very accomplished now.This book was basically everything I wanted: A book about rom-coms (there were quotes from rom-coms at the beginning of each chapter !!), an ENEMIES TO LOVERS, FAKE DATING, sooo much denial, and drama, drama, DRAMA.Liz is relatable in the sense that she's just trying to live life and garner the courage to ask out her life long crush and also she LOVES listening to music, something I relate to on a spiritual level. Also, you bet that I'm gonna be making a playlist of the Wes and Liz playlist shown in the back of the book. And she also loves rom-coms and SO DO I.“I fell in love with teasing you in the second grade, when I first discovered that I could turn your cheeks pink with just a word. Then I fell in love with you.”Now. Wes. I loved him so much, and he had me screeching MULTIPLE different times. He's the bad boy next door but he's also so sweet and kind, and not really a bad boy at all, it's just that he's portrayed that way because Liz despised him. I love him so much and I want him for myself.I also really loved the family connections in this. Liz had a slightly rocky relationship with her step-mom Helena, but I love that they were able to connect, and talk, and really get the chance to learn more about each other.The friendships in this were also GOLD. Joss seems like a great friend, and I can understand her frustrations when Liz was being a neglectful and sucky friend. Wes's friends were also really nice and sweet to Liz.Now, it was pretty chill through the book, but near the end, the drama just came pouring in and then I was reminded: Rom-coms are filled to the brim with drama. That's why I love them, besides the cute romances and cliche tropes that I just so happen to love.Also, Wes's 'big hands' were mentioned a lot. I mean, I don't mind but it was a little repetitive, if we're gonna get nit-picky.Liz's internal denial of her feelings was hilarious, and it just had me shouting at the book, telling her to just kiss him already!Also, I screamed at that moment in Wes's car.This book was also funny too: a lot of the lines made me laugh, and though it could be cheesy, cringey, and cliche, isn't that what you want out of a rom-com?I loved Wes from the beginning, and while Michael seemed like a great guy, Wes was just better.I will definitely be rereading this when I am either sad or want something cute, or just want to reread this.5 stars“She’s not you.”“What?”“She.

I\'m at a lack of words for describing how it truly made mefeel-- because this book resonates with my soul and my heart and my mind so wonderfully, it just filled me with awe from within, leaving me drowning in an eternal swirl of emotions, a ruin because of a mere novel.“But then she snapped your neck.”Tears rolled down his face.“And I felt you die,” he whispered.Tears were sliding down my own cheeks.This book is a story aboutlifeandloveand every gray shade in between. A story about the bleak days and the lovely winds of change. A story about hard-fought happiness and soul-wrenching sacrifices. And a story about a girl who finds herself drifting away into the fields of nothingness only to discover the stars and moon and night sky pointing towards her glorious rebirth.Feyre, oh dear Feyre. I amso so proudof her and who she\'s become at the end of the novel. She\'s so exhilarating and vibrant and incredibly strong. But she was not like this in the beginning. The events in the previous book shredded her apart from the inside out, living only a shell of the brave young woman we cheered for. My heart ached for her. But she finds herself again -- her true self, her wild heart, her luminous spark of daring, fierce, brilliant dreams. And the heroine that emerges is coated with sheer determination, powerful bravery and astounding compassion.I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal.I was a survivor, and I was strong.I would not be weak, or helpless again.I would not, could not be broken. Tamed.I want to assure everyone that not one character,NO ONE, acts OOC. And besides Feyre, no one changes. You know what I\'m talking about -- the alpha-males vulturing around Feyre. ACoTaR only showed us bits and pieces, but we mustn\'t jump to the wrong conclusions about certain people especially since the depth of ACoTaR felt (at least to me) similar to a Vegas wedding after meeting a guy in the hotel lobby, whereasACoMaF was a reality check. Harsh and cruel and unyielding.This being said, I liked Tamlin. He was true to himself. Everything he does, he does out of love and of fear of losing Feyre. And we all know that people blinded by love can often make mistakes -- and Tam did. Many mistakes. A lack of understanding intoxicated him and an imperative need for control severed his perception. Paradoxically, we get to know him better even if he\'s not a present figure throughout the book. And perhaps, now that we\'ve seen more of his layers and facades... perhaps we see him in a much different light. He has issues and I truly believe Amarantha messed him up mentally -- nowhere near the trauma Feyre endured, but still a haunting scar imprinted on his demeanor. Regardless, do not mistake all I\'ve said as excuses in his defense, because they are not. They do not excuse his ultimate authority, his condescending attitude and his infuriatingly rash decisions for which he does need to suffer the consequences.I just cannot wait to see him get his ass handed to him by Feyre.“He did—does love me, Rhysand.”“The issue isn’t whether he loved you, it’s how much. Too much. Love can be a poison.”Rhysand, on the other hand, was the epitome ofdamn. I might even have a confession to make... He might...*gulp*... have overthrown Will Herondale and Dorian Havilliard as my favorite book boyfriend!!Rhys embodies the highest standards for fictional males. His bad-boy allure. His arrogance. His cunning mind. His elegance. His astounding power. But these are nothing compared to his internal beauty -- his selflessness, his nerve-wrecking intensity, his carefully crafted mask, his turmoil and his kindness. His self-doubt brought me to my knees, because he is such a precious cinnamon roll and he doesn\'t realize it. Andholy shithis past was just too much --I WAS (AM) AN EMOTIONAL MESS.“You think I don’t know how stories get written—how this story will be written?” Rhys put his hands on his chest, his face more open, more anguished than I’d seen it. “I am the dark lord, who stole away the bride of spring. I am a demon, and a nightmare, and I will meet a bad end. He is the golden prince—the hero who will get to keep you as his reward for not dying of stupidity and arrogance.”And you wanna know what?HE\'S A GODDAMN FEMINIST. If that doesn\'t make you fall in love with him head over heels, I don\'t know what will. Plus Rhys is basically the hottest fictional guy ever created (Darkling + Warner + Dorian = omg). WHY ISN\'T HE REAL???*sobs*“Tamlin won’t allow it.”“Tamlin isn’t your keeper, and you know it.”“I’m his subject, and he is my High Lord—”“You are no one’s subject.”***“Maybe it’d be a mercy to be ended—A broad hand gripped my face—gently enough not to hurt, but hard enough to make me look at him. “Don’t you ever think that,” Rhysand hissed, his eyes livid. “Not for one damned moment.”***""She wins,” Rhys breathed. “That bitch wins if you let yourself fall apart.""Lucien remains clever and intuitive and even though his relationship with our heroine gets stranded, his only flaw is undying, blind loyalty and I cannot fault him for that.Moving now onto more serious topics -- the new characters. We have quite a lot, but by far the loveliest ones are Rhysand\'s Inner Circle.They\'re squad goals. FierceMorrigan; strange and kickassAmren; sassy, arrogant and skilledCassian; reserved and observantAzriel. All these, plus Rhys, entangle a dynamic that createsa family. I loved them to bits. Secondary characters, yet so wonderfully nuanced, three-dimensional characters that gut you with their own stories and make you shed a tear at how much they love each other. Plus, they cracked me up on a constant basis. And the respect and unflinching support they have between them was all kinds ofwowandawwww.Okay. Enough with the stalling. Let\'s venture into dangerous territory akathe romance.*deep breath*I want to start by sayingthere is no love triangle-- there\'s onlya wonderful, all-consuming and healthyrelationship that evolves naturally until it reaches paramount heights. I was constantly plastered with a stupid, goofy grin on my face whenever this couple interacted or was simply in the same scene. What makes them absolutely beautiful in my perspective isthe mutual respect, honesty and supportthey have for each other -- it paints them with anempoweringand downright heartwarming glow. Their amazingfriendship, their sparkingchemistry, their hilariousbanterand their hot as helltensionhad me repeatedly blessing the gods for Maas.“He locked you up because he knew—the bastard knew what a treasure you are. That you are worth more than land or gold or jewels. He knew, and wanted to keep you all to himself.”***“I’m thinking,” he said, following the flick of my tongue over my bottom lip, “that I look at you and feel like I’m dying. Like I can’t breathe.”Besides those strong traits of their relationship, I need to mention the steaminess and sexiness and overallHOTNESS.Because this book? It\'s hot. Like black-in-the-middle-of-July-in-California-hot. NA, after all. You thought ACoTaR was hot?YOU THOUGHT WRONG-- prepare yourself for hyperventilating, fangirling and swooning, \'cause SJM\'s writing skills slay in those scenes.“I heard every word between you. I knew you could take care of yourself, and yet … ” He went back to his pie, swallowing a bite before continuing. “And yet I found myself deciding that if you took his hand, I would find a way to live with it. It would be your choice.”I sipped from my wine. “And if he had grabbed me?”There was nothing but uncompromising will in his eyes. “Then I would have torn apart the world to get you back.”Oh oh oh but there are some other ships that get my blood pumping even though they\'re not sailing -- YET THEY SHOULD. They totally should. Mozriel and Nessian embody pure awesomeness.And Elain and Lucien will be so interesting to see play out!What I enjoyed tremendously about this particular sequel is how it managed to expand the realm beyond its initial borders, in terms of world-building, depth and history. ACoTaR now seems like a small piece of a giant puzzle, the lovely but common retelling ofBeauty and the Beastpaling in comparison to ACoMaF which, while just teasing us with glimpses of the real deal that\'s to come, contained a sense of radiant and vastepicness.The most special and bewildering aspect is the lush and vivid portrayal of the Night Court. Enthralling and contradictory, it completely enraptures you with its seductive tone. So different from the Spring Court (and Summer Court which we get to visit!!). But I expected something disheartening and equally dark, and while this mysterious court has that vibe and then some, there is also such glorious light and normalcy and elegance that reside in its spectrum. The Court of Nightmares gave me goosebumps. The Court of Dreams, however, gave me breath and life. The book centers in Velaris andohmygod this city! I loved Velaris with all my being and if there ever was a fictional place or universe in which I\'d want to live, then Velaris and the Night Court are it.Plotwise, there isn\'t really much to say, honestly, besides the fact that the king of Hybern is the new big bad wolf (as expected) and he wants to bring chaos into this world. But his presence is subtle, his threat only looming on the horizon -- the finale will deal with him more. Yet we encounter intrigue and secrets and eye-opening side stories and tales that create the legacy of Prythan hand in hand with the world-building. It felt similar toHeir of Fire, a journey of healing rather than grueling war. However, as in HoF, the last few chapters left me breathless and white-knuckled as I gripped the book to read every single word.Betrayals, alliances, resurrections, magic and evil marvelously unraveled in an explosive punch, a mic drop of a sort.It leaves you craving more the very next instant.We\'ll see more Nesta and Elain and Tam and Lucien in the next book, that\'s for sure. But the stakes are so high and the game of hide and seek between friends and enemies so dangerous that I cannot help but be in a continual frenzy until the sequel. It\'s going to be as much of a masterpiece as this one, certainly.A Court of Mist and Furymade me want to re-read it the second I\'ve finished it -- and re-read again afterwards. It made me want to live in its universe. It made me want to be friends with the characters, tell them how much I adore them and just how precious they all are. It made me feel alive in so many ways that it also rendered me speechless.But you know where its absolute beauty resides? It\'s in the cleverness with which it was constructed. Sarah J. Maas outdid herself -- with the loose threads, with the vibe ofHades & Persephoneand with the countless clues and hints that begged for a re-read of ACoTaR in order to pick them up bit by bit. No one can say she changed her creation to her whim, because it was all carefully planned out, mapped out ever since the first page of the first installment.“You are my salvation, Feyre.”A Court of Mist and Furyis my newfavorite bookand I\'ll keep it close to my heart from now on. Enchanting, clever and masterfully written, it shattered my expectations and raised itself on a gold pedestal. I love it completely and I hope you\'ll do so too -- as fiercely as Feyre loves the night.On a chirpier note though, I\'ll go drown myself into a hell of a long book-slump because nothing,absolutely nothing can come close to this glorious book while its remnants shine so brightly in my mind.ENJOY! <3P.S.:My headcanon fanart for ACoMaF:My Night Court photoset is a bit spoilery, so here\'s theTumblr link.My ACoMaF inspired playlist --The Stars Who ListenListen here:8tracks;YouTube.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'HOLY FUCKING SHIT. HOLY. FUCKING. SHIT.A COURT OF MIST AND FURY IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE.***CONTAINS A SHIT TON OF SPOILERS***REALLY, IF YOU HAVE NOT FINISHED THE BOOK YET, DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW.THIS BOOK IS WAAAAAAAY MORE THAN 5 STARS, IT\'S MORE LIKE 1000000000000000/5 STARS. I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE PERFECT BUT I DIDN\'T KNOW IT WAS GONNA BETHISPERFECT.To be completely honest with you guys, I have absolutely no idea where to start, so I\'m warning you, this is gonna be far from an actual review.May 3rd was the day I died.I ran to my mailbox, knowing what awaited me there. I opened it and saw the box, amazon prime tape all over it. I took it and ran back inside my house. I stared at the box and took a deep breath...THEN RIPPED THAT SHIT UP. I CLAWED AT IT, SHREDDING THE WHOLE FUCKING BOX IN THE PROCESS. I SAW THAT BLUE FUCKING COVER AND KNEW THAT MY LIFE WAS NEVER GONNA BE THE SAME. I TOOK THAT FUCKING BOOK AND TURNED THAT SHIT OVER. THE COVER WAS FUCKING BEAUTIFUL. SCREAMING LIKE I WAS BEING TORTURED IN THE DEEP PITS OF HELL, I RAN AND SAT MY ASS DOWN ON THE COUCH. I OPENED THAT SHIT UP AND READ TIL MY EYES BLED. DAMN STRAIGHT.So all I read in the first 40 pages or so was blah blah blah Tamlin blah blah blah Where\'s Rhys.And then the moment we\'ve been waiting for happened. The moment whereRHYSAND INTERRUPTS FEYRE\'S WEDDING TO BRING HER TO THE NIGHT COURT. FUCK YEAH.The Night Court is the most beautiful thing ever. Could it be any better? No. It was perfection. And when Rhys winnows with her there, Feyre\'s first instinct is to throw a shoe at him.THE ALL-POWERFUL, MOST FEARED HIGH LORD OF THE NIGHT COURT GOT HIT BY A SHOE.It was adorable.And Rhys helped teach Feyre how to read and it was the best thing ever. All the while training her on her new found powers. These powers came from the seven High Lords and Feyre has all of them.EVEN RHYS\'SFeyre became a very strong character in this book, Sarah knows how to work in that character development! She knew how to fight for herself and always wanted to be there to help in times of need. And the reason for leaving the Spring Court forever was because stupid Tamlin didn\'t let her go anywhere and practically made the estate Feyre\'s new prison cell. How symbolic. Remember that time Under the Mountain, Tamlin? When your ""beloved"" was trapped in that same cell for three whole months? How you didn\'t do anything about it and watched her rot? How on her last day Under the Mountain, you wanted to have sex with her instead of trying to free her? Ever think of those things Tamlin? Doesn\'t seem like it because now you\'ve recreated that same cell that\'s caused her so much trauma. Isn\'t he the greatest.When Feyre made the decision to stay at the Night Court with Rhys and the squad (who I adore so much by the way), I was so happy. Not just because that meant Rhys and Feyre time (whoo!), but because it showed how strong she\'s become and that she finally escaped the captivity of the Spring Court into the freedom of the Night Court. And she is a total bad ass.The Night Court squad is so awesome. We\'ve got Mor, Amren, Cassian, and Azriel who I love all equally. They all have character depth, flaws, and pasts that we learn about. Mor\'s past was devastating and made me want to just give her the biggest hug. I also enjoyed amren a lot because she looks like she could kill you and will actually kill you. And Azriel and Cassian are also really fun to read about as well. They are all cinnamon rolls.Let me just say, I love it when the girl saves the guy. In this case, it was Feyre saving Rhysand. They were flying and Rhys was hit in the back with ash arrows and was captured and whipped. Now Feyre, she wasMAD.She winnowed and killed the guys torturing Rhys like the total boss she is and saved Rhys from death. I was seriously so scared for my baby.NOW IS THE TIME TO BRING IT UP GUYS. THE MOMENT WE\'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR. WE WANTED IT TO HAPPEN FOR SO LONG. AND NOW IT\'S OUT IN THE OPEN. READY THE CANON.RHYSAND AND FEYRE ARE MATES.RHYSAND. AND. FEYRE. ARE. MATES.THE FANDOM RIGHT NOW.AND RHYS HAD DREAMS ABOUT FEYRE BEFORE HE EVEN MET HER. WHEN HE FIRST MET FEYRE HE HAD A SENSE THAT THEY WERE MATES. HE KNEW THE WHOLE TIME, AND IT BROUGHT MORE TEARS TO MY POOR EYES. IT ACTUALLY MAKES ME WANT TO REREAD A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES JUST TO HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW ON IT. AND RHYSAND REALIZED HE LOVED FEYRE WHEN HE HELD THE DAGGER TO AMARANTHRA\'S NECK.RHYSAND AND FEYRE ARE MATES AND EVERYTHING IS RIGHT IN THE WORLD.AND WHEN RHYS TOLD FEYRE EVERYTHING, (AND I MEAN EVERYTHING)...(LIKE REALLY EVERYTHING), I CRIED. IT WAS SOOOO.... I\'M SORRY I CAN\'T EVEN PUT IT INTO WORDS, BUT YOU PROBABLY FELT THE SAME THING. YOU KNOW.AND THE NIGHT OF STARFALL. OMG MY BABIES. THEY WERE AT THE BALCONY AND THEY WERE SHARING PERSONAL THINGS (I LIVE FOR THESE MOMENTS). AND THE ABSOLUTE MOST ADORABLE THING THAT HAPPENED WAS WHEN THEY BOTH WERE HIT IN THE FACE BY THE STARLIGHT AND LAUGHED. LAUGHED. AND SMILED SO MUCH. FEYRE HADN\'T SMILED LIKE THAT IN FOREVER. AND OH DEAR LORD SAVE ME, I\'M PICTURING THE GRIN RHYSAND GAVE FEYRE RIGHT NOW AND IT MAKES ME MEEEELLLLTTTT. I JUST SIMPLY CANNOT.Now, let\'s talk about the hottest scenes ever between my dear Rhys and Feyre.THEY WERE SO STEAMY AND I WAS FREAKING OUT THE WHOLE TIME. I DIDN\'T KNOW IF THIS WAS REAL LIFE OR NOT. AND THEY LASTED PAAAAAGGGGEESSS. A GLORIOUS AMOUNT OF PAGES. THESE WERE THE FELLOW STEAMY SCENES:COURT OF NIGHTMARES.THE CRAMPED BEDROOM.MATE REALIZATION. (THE BEST ONE)And Rhys is not who we expected him to be. He\'s sacrificed so much for his people like I can\'t even explain becauseHE SACRIFICED SO DAMN MUCH.And I seriously cried when he revealed all these things about himself.MAIN CAUSE OF MY EMOTIONAL TRAUMA RIGHT THERE.I could go on and on forever about the many many many precious Rhys and Feyre moments, but let\'s talk about that ending.Things were so perfect so far that I was getting scared. Scared that all that perfectness was going to be ripped away and I was going to be one emotional mess. And for a minute there, I was. You guys know what I\'m talking about.So Feyre and Rhysand acted like Feyre was under Rhysand\'s control the whole time so it made it seem like Feyre actually still loved Tamlin and that she wanted to go back with him. And then she wanted to make it seem more real. And I\'m like ""FEYRE IF YOU FUCKING TELL THE KING TO BREAK YOUR MATE BOND I SWEAR-"" And then she tells the king to break the mate bond. And Rhysand\'s screams just shattered my heart when he was about to. And shithead Tamlin\'s says ""Do it."".AND THE FUCKING KING OF HYBERN BROKE RHYS AND FEYRE\'S MATE BOND.I THOUGHT IT WAS OVER THEN AND THERE. I COMPLETELY LOST MY SHIT.BUT WAIT. IT\'S NOT OVER.RHYSAND AND FEYRE WERE ALSO ACTING THAT OUT TOO. THE MATE BOND WASN\'T BROKEN. I REPEAT, THE MATE BOND WAS NOT BROKEN. THE KING JUST BROKE THE BARGAIN WITHOUT REALIZING IT WASN\'T THE MATE BOND. THAT LOVE CANNOT BE BROKEN, ESPECIALLY RHYSAND AND FEYRE\'S. AND SO NOW THIS SETS UP THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD BOOK. FEYRE IS GOING TO SPY ON THE SPRING COURT AND SEND THE INFORMATION DOWN THE MATE BOND TO RHYS. YEAH FEYRE YOU GO GIRL.Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that Nesta and Elain were turned into High Fae. And Lucien is mated with Elain. Crazy, am I right?!AND FEYRE IS NOW HIGH LADY OF THE NIGHT COURT.I AM COMPLETELY SPEECHLESS AND AM STILL IN UTTER SHOCK AT HOW BEYOND AMAZINGLY PERFECT A COURT OF MIST AND FURY WAS. I CAN\'T EVEN PUT IT INTO WORDS. EVEN A GIF. I JUST-- WOW. YOU GUYS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I\'M FEELING RIGHT NOW. RHYSAND AND FEYRE ARE EVERYTHING I EVER WANTED.THE THIRD BOOK SHOULD BE CALLED ""A COURT OF PAIN AND EMOTIONAL TRAUMA"" BECAUSE THAT\'S HOW IT\'S PROBABLY GONNA GO. HERE COMES THE YEAR LONG WAIT. I DON\'T THINK I\'LL SURVIVE WITHOUT IT LONG ENOUGH. I WANT IT SOOOOO BADLY!!!!!AND I\'M MEETING FUCKING SARAH J. MASS ON THE 14TH AT THE CHICAGO BOOK CON TO GET MY COPY OF ACOMAF SIGNED AND MEET HER IN THE PROCESS! I\'LL MOST LIKELY BE RENDERED SPEECHLESS JUST LIKE AFTER I FINISHED ACOMAF. I AM SERIOUSLY SO EXCITED.I WILL SAY IT AGAIN: A COURT OF MIST AND FURY IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE.""To the stars who listen-- and the dreams that are answered.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Instagram||Threads||Facebook||Amazon||TikTokI almost tossed this down in disgust five times while reading this book. I knew, going in, that it was going to be a massive act of revisionism with regard to Rhysand, the villain of the first book. And as someone who loves villains and thePersephone myththat could have been something I could have gotten behind under the right circumstances. But I wasn\'ttrulyprepared for the narrative gymnastics that this book would perform to try to redeem him without really making him do any legwork. By the end of the book, he\'s still a sleaze lord, only now he\'s a sad sleaze lord in leather pants who was actually the heroine\'s soulmate all along and an all around Nice Guy. Pop a fedora on his head and he\'d probably ""milady"" his way through the Night Court.Big yikes.The beginning of the book was great, and very much in keeping with ACoTaR. Feyre has PTSD (understandable) and so does Tamlin (also understandable) and they\'re trying to heal and find the same love for each other that was the fuel for Feyre to save him under the mountain in the first place. The passion between them in the beginning was great. Feyre\'s misgivings about ruling also made sense. I could even understand why Tamlin would want to be so overprotective. He felt like he had betrayed her in failing to keep her safe and was overcompensating for it in the worst way by essentially treating her like she was made out of glass.Enter Rhysand, who makes good on his bargain to take Feyre back to his court for seven days a month. He actually ruins Feyre\'s wedding, where she is about to get married to Tamlin but having a major case of cold feet and PTSD. He tells her that her wedding dress is ugly and tells her that she should thank him for saving her the effort of breaking things off, because he is *chef\'s kiss* a prince among men. *eye roll* He takes it upon himself to teach Feyre to read and write and is so shocked that she was allowed to be illiterate for so long... which was kind of weird to me, because I was pretty sure that TAMLIN was actually teaching her how to read in book one?? Maybe I\'m wrong, but I seem to remember Tamlin teaching her to read was a major part of his introduction as love interest.Also, apparently Feyre hates painting now and is totally upset that Tamlin gives her a set of paints as a present. Because how dare he get her something that she used to like but didn\'t tell him that she doesn\'t like anymore. How dare he not be a mind-reader like Rhysand who is a prince among men.Anyway, things between Tamlin and Feyre aren\'t so great when she gets back. She starts noticing that he\'s really controlling but they never really sit down and talk about it. She whines about it but never discusses anything with him... and yes, while his behavior isn\'t great, locking her in the tower is hardly the abusive act that Feyre milked for all it was worth. It was bad, yes, but it\'s not like Rhysand was free of faults (oh no, we\'ll be getting to that), and yet his past was wiped so clean it was practically sparkling, while Tamlin\'s smaller crimes are portrayed as the Greatest Wrongs in the History of Wrongs, and you would think he put her up in some kind of prison camp for all that she goes on about Tamlin locking her up and Rhysand freeing her. IT WAS SO ANNOYING.The ""mate"" thing is really just a neat excuse to forgo any groveling while also explaining this seeming switch mid-series between love interests. We learn that Rhysand sexually assaulted Feyre for her own good, to keep her angry so she wouldn\'t give up hope. WOW, WHAT A GREAT GUY. About 370-pages in, he finally brings up the assault and sort-of-but-not-really-apologizes and Feyre merely shrugs it off, despite the fact that in book one, everything he did was infuriating and traumatizing to her, and she HATED his guts and HATED him for parading her around and objectifying her in front of Rhysand, drugged her, mind raped her, and even made jokes about forcing herself on her, but yeah, Tamlin\'s the bad guy because he locked her in her room ONE TIME.It\'s kind of amazing, really, how eager Feyre was to throw Tamlin in the trash.Also, like Celaena/Aelin in THRONE OF GLASS, it isn\'t enough for Feyre to be a bad-ass fighter on her own terms, no. When she comes back with the gifts of the other Lords, she comes back with LITERALLY ALL OF THEIR POWERS, and she is so powerful that people are going to kill her just to keep her powers from manifesting. Because a heroine just isn\'t worth salt if she isn\'t the Queen of the Specialverse, I guess. Part of what made Feyre so endearing in book one is because she actually did have to struggle to succeed; here, everything is served to her on a silver platter.I skipped over most of the Night Court things... they were so boring.Of course, Tamlin has to become a traitor. Maas basically did to him what she did to Chaol and Dorian in THRONE OF GLASS. They both become terribad people so Rowan can show up and steal the scene with his earth-shattering orgasms. I guess maybe even the author realized that Tamlin didn\'t look that bad, so making him into a betrayer was necessary for giving Feyre a clean-cut reason to dump his ass without looking petty. Also, apparently he harbors a sexual assaulter in his court, because in this book we learn that YET ANOTHER WOMAN IN THIS BOOK tried to have her way with Rhys without his consent, and Tamlin just keeps her around... because he\'s the bad guy now.We\'re supposed to feel sorry for Rhysand because he was Amarantha\'s ""whore,"" and yes, I do feel sorry for him... Amarantha was awful... but that doesn\'t excuse his own abuse. ""This is for your own good"" is literally one of the go-to phrases of abusers. He was AWFUL in A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES and he never really grovels for it. He tells Feyre abouthisabuses while crying, but that\'s all about HIM. He provides plenty of reasons-- excuses-- about why he did what he did, but this serves more to brush off his actions than genuine contrition. I wouldn\'t even care if he became her love interest as the villain if he was actually KEPT as a villain, but it\'s like all that brutality gets a pass because he is, in fact, a nice guy. Also, the casual story about what basically serves as an allegory to genital mutilation in his mother\'s court was super disturbing and mentioned like once, but holy yikes-- his parents were fucked up, and I felt like that should have been unpacked more.Lastly... the mental illness rep. Some people apparently think it\'s great. No. I don\'t think it is. Love basically cures Feyre\'s ills. While it\'s true that being in an unhealthy relationship can exacerbate existing mental illnesses and cause ones you are predisposed to to manifest, being in a good relationship is not a cure. You don\'t lose your PTSD or whatever because the sex is good and you\'ve found your soul mate. That is a toxic trope in way too many romances, and I can\'t stand for it. ALSO, what about Tamlin\'s PTSD? This was also never really discussed. Does only Feyre get to behave irrationally and have freak outs? That\'s an unrealistic expectation to have, and her contribution to that toxic relationship was never even discussed... because of course, Feyre is perfect.On second thought, maybe she is perfect for Rhysand. They\'re both selfish trash people.One of the crowning moments in this book is Feyre saying NOBODY HAS SUFFERED OR GONE HUNGRY LIKE I HAVE while a few chapters before she was hating on Tamlin for literally tithing his people until they starve. I guess she\'s the High Lady of Virtue Signalling as well. Fuck the poor people if they don\'t give her an excuse to hate on Tamlin. I don\'t believe they\'re mentioned again.If you forget how perfect this couple is, Feyre and Rhysand will remind you 2342342 times why the two of them are the Faerie Jesuses Incarnate who died and prostituted themselves for your sins.This almost reads like bad fanfiction of the first book. I really don\'t feel like Rhyand and Feyre were destined to be together from the beginning. I felt like maybe Maas initially planned on a love triangle but maybe thought Rhysand was too rough around the edges, and so worked double-time trying to find reasons to excuse all of his behavior and make him supes enamored with the heroine.The greatest death in this series wasn\'t Junian\'s or Amarantha\'s... it was Tamlin\'s character.It isn\'t even like Rhysand is perfect in this book. His flirting is literally saying things to Feyre that most men would get slapped for. He talks to her like one of those sexist asshats inMadmen. He\'s constantly talking about her appearance in a creepy way, and helaughswhen she\'s upset that he used her as bait for the Attor. Even their bargain, which ended up allowing him to read her mind, was done without consent, and he certainly doesn\'t ask for consent every time he reads her mind. At one point, he even says that he could rip her mind apart if he wanted. It\'s almost like this book was written out with the intention of having him still be the villain and Maas changed her mind halfway through.I really couldn\'t stand this book.Rhysand and Rowan are literally the same person, and their ""development"" with the heroine follows the same trajectory. It\'s not the worst book I\'ve read, and it\'s not even the worst Maas book I\'ve ever read, butI will never for the life of me understand why this series is so popular, or why some people who eagerly condemn other books for being problematic seem so eager to forgive or ignore the flaws in this one.Your mileage may vary.1 to 1.5 stars'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'When I finished this book,the mountains trembled.*Do I need to remind you to be civil?

I thought so.Oh well.I’m going to say this just once: it’s calledmanipulation.Now look at me, Maas. Do I look like a reader who enjoys being manipulated to you?No? Why,I thought so.To all those who still have to start this series and are intentioned to:don’t readA Court of Thornes and Roses. Spoil yourself a little of what happens there andstart with this one. Because -and this is the truly sad thing, as someone else said before me-A Court of Mist and Furycould even be enjoyable if the first book had not happened before.•I won’t go so far as to say that what we have here is a case of lack of “show” and an excess of “tell”, because the first chapters do show that Tamlin, whether for some PTSD or because he has always been a scumbag, undeniably acts like the worst man on the planet. I am even willing to forgive howcaricaturalhis behaviour appears. But, throughout the book, every occasion is a good occasion to throw in a comment tooverturncompletely also all the positive parts of him that are showed in the first book.(In this regard, I should say that inA Court of Thornes and RosesI did not care for Tamlin in any way, so I am not speaking out of frustrated adoration.)In this scenario, Tamlin is the epitome of all evil, while Rhys, of course, the epitome of all good: Tamlin cares for hierarchy, Rhys cares for family and nothing more (ugh); Tamlin wants her caged, Rhys want her free; as it turns out,it was Tamlin’s betrayal to begin the feud between his family and Rhys’s, and so on. I am not in any way saying that a man shouldn’t give freedom to his woman (it’s not that he should;he must, uncompromisingly), or that a plot-twist like the one I mentioned isn’t a good turn of events, even in terms of characterization, but everything is just sostereotypicalandtriteandsickly sweet.All of this,in the name of a ship. I think Maas should understand that falling out of love is just as normal as falling in. People fall out of love for normal reasons even if their exes don’t suddenly turn into maniacs.I am sick of this device, courtesy ofQueen of Shadows, and I don’t need the new love interest to be pushed on me: I am perfectly able to decide for myself.•I’ve seen some reviews in which these two characters are described as complex and multifaceted on the basis of their role reversal. Allow me to say that, in my opinion,nothing about them, in this book, is complex nor controversial.Maas did nothing more than switch their places and their personalities with them: Tamlin was the good one and turns out to be the villain; Rhysand was the villain (somehow, and indeed the Rhysand of the first book is the one I can honestly call intriguing) and now he is nothing short of a Fae Prince Charming.Simple as that.Besides,I liked Rhysandin this book, butI deeply missed the more wicked, morally grey part of himthat we saw Under the Mountain. He’s hot, sure, but he also comes off asflatand, at times,pathetic.•It was a dick moveto lock Feure up in the mansion, yes. And yet, I can’t wrap my mind around Feyre’s fickleness, considering thattwo chapter latershe says this:“I\'m thinking that I was a lonely, hopeless person, and I might have fallen in love with the first thing-thing? Now he’s a thing?-that showed me a hint of kindness and safety. And I\'m thinking maybe he knew that- maybe not actively, but maybe he wanted to be that person for someone. And maybe that worked for who I was before. Maybe it doesn\'t work for who- what I am now.""She hadevery rightto leave the mansion and let him stew for a while, but if that is the result of months and months of undying love, well. He stopped being worth of her love maybe, but I don’t think she fought for it that hard either, especially if he really was dealing with some PTSD. I think love is also about trying to fight for the other person even when they don’t seem to fight for us, to give them time, to give them chances, even though at one point we have to stop.It just would have been nicer and more enjoyable if Feyre’s affection’s shift hadn’t been so swift, that’s it.•All the contradictions. Feyre leave her abusive boyfriend, but then falls in the arms of a man who breaks every bone of a guy who called her names. Uh-uh. And if you say “He did that because he called her ‘whore’, and he’d been called whore too, and thetrauma”, I say: how do you know Tamlin’s behaviour wasn’t due to his trauma too. Maybe he just needed time. But it’s okay if it’s Rhysand that does that because epitome-of-perfection, remember?Hisbeing all possessive is okay. He can say things like “She’s mine” and snarl at people who so much as look at her. And don’t get me started on indecent exposure.•Thenew charactersare all nice and pretty and invariably haunted by a dark dark past. It’s nice to read about them and to witness their banters, but they don’t stand out as particularly well-written or sophisticated.•Theplotis evenweakerthan Maas’s usual. And contrary to what I usually do, I’ll sum it up for you: Feyre flees. TheMy Little Ponies gang- ops. I meant the Court of Dreams’ defenders (I know, the ponies were cooler) look for Things. Which do Stuff. Precisely, destroy Taran’s Black Cauldron and defeat The Horned King, minus the fluffy Gurgi.Well, wrong story, but that\'s basically what happens.In more than 600 pages.•People purr. Normal cats, thank God, ordinarily talk like freaking civilized beings.•The first timeRhysand and Feyre have sex and he climaxes, the mountains tremble. I refuse to comment on this thing, and if it was me who had written such embarrassing idiocy, I would be hiding my head under the sand. Moreover, allthe sex scenesare verycheesy,dramaticandover-written.•Lucien andElain’s mating bond. I swear on my heart I have never, ever read anything more ridiculous than this scene (oh, no, wait: the mountains). The passage from normal, rational person to mad caveman takes less time than a spark to burn. I almost expected he started hissing “My preciousss”.•And yet,I enjoyed it, or better, I enjoyedRhys,Rhys, his long, sappy, tearydeclaration/explanation(I have a thing for this trope; it could have been a thousand times worse than it actually is, and still I would\'ve loved it. I am such a softie, I know. My fault), theending, andRhys. The other things I pretty much despised. I also appreciate the fact that at least the author tried –and at some length, I think, even succeeded a tiny bit- to conceive a scenario in which Rhys’s cuddliness actually makes some sense.I still prefer him wicked.➽ To sum it up, what can I say? I read it with with ease because of an extremely fluent, even though not particularly sophisticated, writing style, and, as we all know, idiocies and mushy stuff can also be enjoyable, and truly, this book take the concept ofguilty pleasureto a whole new level. Nonetheless, I am sorry, but I can\'t overcome theirritationthat Maas\'s little games cause in me. She used the same lame and unprofessional trick twice now; my trust in her is gone, and I\'m wondering if we should expect a third time too.EDIT29/03/16: Ok, so I read the excerpt -as usual, unforgivably late, but this time the delay is due to the fact that I didn\'t know whether to read it or not. If you want to join the club, you can find ithere.What do I think of it? I simply think that making a protagonist goOOCwith three plain lines does take an inconceivable amount of talent.

I AM SCARED. I\'m totally open to the whole Feyre/Rhys thing, but I love Tamlin so much and I don\'t want him to be ruined by Sarah J. Maas! Can someone please tell her that she can make us love a character without ruining another character?Because really, I ship Feyre and Tamlin, but I will not be mad if SJM handles Rhys\'s and Feyre\'s relationship with cleverness.PLEASE SJM, DON\'T RUIN TAMLIN....And of course, WHAT DID SJM DO? RUIN TAMLIN!I tried to write my review without major plot spoilers, but there will be some minor spoilers about how the characters were handled. And warning: my emotions over this book are a mess, you\'ll se how contrary they are!Anyway... let me begin:OH, I was mad! I was so angry when I started reading this book, because it is in the first chapter that you notice that Tamlin has changed and not for good. Now he\'s an asshole. He\'s insensitive and controlling, I couldn\'t stand him! So congrats, SJM, you made me despise my (now former) favorite character in this series.I read a few reviews that said that Tamlin was always like that (a possessive piece of shit), but NO. HE WASN\'T! He was caring and protective, not a control freak. I feel that Tamlin changed because of everything that happened with Amarantha. Everyone comments on how Feyre had PTSD and Tamlin didn\'t try to understand her, but I think Tamlin also had PTSD. What he went through with Amarantha (and with almost losing Feyre) had a huge toll in him. I can accept that he changed because of that, but no one acknowledges it, not the readers, not Feyre, not even SJM.So that must mean that he just changed because he\'s an asshole (I\'m not buying it).My problem is that SJM wanted to force Rhysand on us, like she wanted to force Rowan on us in her Throne of Glass series. Excuse me, miss, but I don\'t need the love interest to be pushed on me. I can decide by myself. And the thing is... I FELL IN LOVE WITH RHYS IN THIS BOOK! And I think I would\'ve fallen for him even if Tamlin hadn\'t been the piece of shit he was.Before this book, I couldn\'t imagine any possible reason that would make Feyre leave Tamlin and fall for Rhys. Not after everything she went through to save Tam, he was the love of her life and her feelings for him were genuine. But then of course, the author put a lot of effort in ruining Tamlin, just so Feyre could fall out of love. What SJM doesn\'t seem to understand is that falling out of love is normal. It\'s perfectly fine. You don\'t have to turn a character into a bad guy for that to happen. Sarah turned Tam into a villain, and that was not necessary.I also hated the comparisons Feyre was always making between Rhys and Tam, so frustrating! They were so obviously put there only to make sure that the reader understood that Tamlin was evil and Rhysand was good:-""Ugh, Tamlin doesn\'t let me go anywhere. But Rhys lets me do anything I want!""-""Ugh, I had my nightmares and Tamlin never woke up to confort me. But Rhys is always there for me when that happens!""-""Ugh, Tamlin only cares about hierarchy. But Rhys cares about family and about his people!""-""Ugh, Tamlin doesn\'t let me enter to his room. But of course Rhys invites me to his!""...I MEAN, SERIOUSLY? We can notice that by ourselves, but Feyre kept comparing and comparing during the whole book.Have you read the Shatter Me series? It was as if Feyre was Juliette, Tamlin was Adam and Rhysand was Warner... the very same pattern! First Tamlin was a cinnamon roll and suddenly he becomes a bad guy who only thinks about himself and is obsessed with Feyre. And Rhys was the evil guy in the first book but then you discover that he had really good reasons to do everything he did, and he\'s a good guy incapable of commiting any evil. Gosh, I really liked Tamlin, but now I simply can\'t stand him. SJM succeeded!And I had other issues with this book... but that was my main one. I\'m afraid this has become the modus-operandi of SJM.Let me talk about those other issues... starting with Rhys. His character really intrigued me in the first installment of this series, he seemed evil, and I knew there was more in him than what he let us see. I knew he had his reasons to act the way he did, and of course I wanted to know why. BUT THIS WAS JUST RIDICULOUS. He\'s not justnot evil, he istoogood, bordering in perfection. He\'s a saint, he\'s ""Saint Rhys"". There is too much goodness in him. He\'s also the ""most powerful Fae ever born"", see? It\'s unnatural to be that perfect.Another issue was that Rhys seems to be the only High Lord that cares about peace and prosperity. He\'s literally the only one trying to stop the King. The other High Lords don\'t care about humans! The other High Lords are stupid! I feel like SJM did this just to add more perfection to Rhysand\'s character: Obviously he\'s the only considerate Fae that cares about the poor humans, the other High Lords are nothing compared to him!Now let\'s go to the other side of my review (this will be drastic): Despite eveything, I LOVE RHYS SO MUCH! UGH, SARAH! You did it, you made me fall in love with him! Maybe it\'s his good nature. Maybe it\'s his perfection. Maybe it\'s because he reminds me of Warner. I don\'t care anymore... I\'m just really rooting for him. I don\'t know how Sarah does it. Even with everything that bothers me about his character, I couldn\'t help falling for him.And it is rare when I change my ship in a series, but I did in this one because there\'s no way I\'d still ship Feyre and Tamlin after everything that happened in this book (which is sad, because I really shipped them in the first book). Now I can only say that I ship Feyre and Rhys SO. MUCH. Their relationship development was beautiful, everything they went through made their love more real, made it stronger. There is no love triangle here, there are no teams, there are simply Feyre and Rhys and I NEED them to be together.There were only two things I didn\'t like about their relationship. 1)The whole: I DREAMT ABOUT YOU BEFORE I MET YOU....Cliché, cliché, cliché. 2) The ""YOU ARE MINE"" parts. I mean, Feyre left Tamlin because he was possesive and controlling, but all those ""you are mine"" are not exactly different, right? I don\'t like that kind of love. It should not be about belonging to someone, it should be about belonging together.I also love Cassian and Azriel. Everything that happened at the end with them made me a sobbing mess! I just hope Cassian recovershis poor wings!, because if not, I\'ll just go to a corner and cry forever.Now let\'s talk about Feyre. Sometimes she infuriated me because of all the comparisons she made and because she was always complaining about Tamlin not trying to understand her, but she didn\'t really try to understand him, either. Sometimes she was really unfair with himExcept when he locked her up, I would\'ve done the same thing Feyre did. AND NO, I don\'t want them back together (NEVER), it\'s just that she made me really mad sometimes. But in contrast, I think she really grew as a character in this book, she blew me away! The scene with the water wolves was AMAZING. AlsoI cried when the evil creatures attacked Velaris! Ugh, stupid queens!!!...I couldn\'t stand it, it was painful to read. But back to Feyre, I like the directon her character is going.I can\'t wait to read the next installment! I know Tamlin doesn\'t have a chance of forgiveness (I myself can\'t ever forgive him), but I\'d like to see redemption in Lucien, he\'s a character with great potential and in this book he was just too weak.The world building was great, a total A+! I\'m still a little confused about the whole Jurian ordeal, but I hope he gets killed soon :). All in all, this book was GREAT, I think that maybe it was better than the first one, and that\'s saying a lot, because I loved ACOTAR. But since I had way too much issues with it, I could not give it 5 stars. I don\'t know how Sarah does it... she makes me love her and hate her in every book she writes! But it\'s more love than hate, I am SJM trash. She\'s QUEEN.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""I've never been thismanipulatedin my life.I was stripped off my free will until there was only a shell left behind, a puppet complying with her master's whim. This is the most vulgar thingSarah J. Maascould do.Allow me to elaborate.•In order to be candid, I have to admit thatI enjoyedA Court of Mist and Furymore than I expected, and found some redeeming traits that prevented me from rating it lower. However, I can't hide my rage and utter disappointment sinceeverything we read inA Court of Thorns and Rosesvanished into thin air. Remember the sweet love story between Tamlin and Feyre that defied immortal tyrants and resulted in great sacrifices in the name of their love? Well, forget about it. We were warned that this would be aHades and Persephone retelling, meaning the romantic relationship between Feyre and Rhysand would be inevitable. The way, though, Sarah handled the transition wasfeebleandinfuriatingto say the least. I don't think there has ever been a character moremistreatedthan Tamlin, with Lucien following suit. We get it, Sarah cares about her precious baby Rhysand, but her real talent as an author would be to make me choose him because I found something unique in him,not because she forced him down my throat. Tamlin's inexcusable behaviour suffocated Feyre, and I felt drowning and suffocating along with her. Since I couldn't possibly wish for her to stay in a mentally abusive relationship, Rhysand was the deus ex machina, the only one to save the damsel in distress, given that her friends abandoned her and her fiance suffered from split personality. Sarah dangled Rhysand in front of me, and every reader, sayingpick him pick him pick him. She had Tamlin and Rhysand facingidenticalsituations, only for Tamlin to do the wrong thing while precious Rhysand was the impersonation of right, of all that's good in the world. Tamlin locked Feyre? Rhysand set her free. Tamlin forbid Feyre from participating in his activities? Rhysand would always have her by his side. Tamlin extinguished the fire burning in Feyre and left her a hollow version of herself? Rhysand fueled that fire, and so on, so on. Now, I've been on the losing side of a triangle before, but always both love interests had some good qualities. In this case, though, Sarah served you the answer on a silver platter by annihilating the opponent and erasing everything that made the relationship between Feyre and Tamlin good and healthy. Rhysand was always sothoughtfulandconsiderateand knew what Feyre needed, he was her salvation. Of course he was, there was afreaking magic bondbetween them that allowed him to read her thoughts. Even the lesser fae servant in the Day Court would understand her needs if they were bonded. In every chapter she would chantRhysand is so gorgeous,Rhysand is so sexy,Rhysand is the most powerful High Lord in the history of Prythianyada yada.We.Get.It.Don't even get me started on the repetition of the wordmate, I rolled my eyes so many times I fear I might have a permanent problem.•Lucien losing his backbone and Tamlin turning into a psycopath a-hole were not the only character mistreatments, though.Rhysand was the victim of his own creator's adoration.In order to make him the perfect match for Feyre, she made himtoo perfect. Gone is the wicked, morally grey, complex character that intrigued us inA Court of Thorns and Roses. While unveilingthisRhysand, instead of finding shadows and darkness and lust for power, we found asappyand fluffy bear asking for love and affection. Everything he did was out oflovefor his friends, for Feyre and his country, and I fail to accept his reasoning behind his actions Under the Mountain. If you don't want the villain to know how you feel about Feyre, you can simply ignore her. But no, why not drug her, grop her while drugged and humiliate her instead?•Now let's get to the relationship between Feyre and Rhysand. For more than the first half of the book I liked them, with their banters and flirtation and the pent-up tension. But from attraction and friendship Feyre suddenly jumped to declarations of love and thenmountains trembledand she startedglowingand their sex scenes varied between steamy to cringe-worthy and more eye-rolling ensued (I seriously need to see an ophthalmologist).•Plotwise, I can't help but notice that some things were veryconvenient. You suspect the King of Hybern is preparing for war? Let's ask the monstrous ancient creature, who in the span of five minutes will give us all the answers, including the means to defeat the King and the exact location of the weapons to nullify his powers. Wanna convince the mortal queens to give you what you need? Write a mushy letter about your love for Feyre. The result is guaranteed. I mean, really?•Why three stars then, you may wonder. Well,I became very fond of the secondary characters. Mor, Azriel, Cassian and the ultimate Queen, Amren, were funny and caring and loyal, and I was actually more invested in their stories (which, to be honest, were all sob stories). I also enjoyed Sarah'slush descriptions, you could feel and breathe and walk the streets of Velaris, and the Summer Court. But most importantly, I admire the way Feyre's trauma from her experiences Under the Mountain was depicted. The guilt, the sorrow, the self-loathing were tangible, and the healing was slow and realistic. Her wounds would be there, and she learned to live with them. Feyre became a strong woman who embraced her gifts, her powers, her sensuality and ferociously claimed her place alongside men. She rose from her ashes.“When you spend so long trapped in darkness, you find that the darkness begins to stare back.”•A Court of Mist and Furyhad great potential, but I can't say I loved it. I'm partially sad because I lost some of my respect for Sarah, for shredding to pieces the characters I loved only to show her own favorites are better. I don't know whether I'll readA Court of Wings and Ruin. Before the last chapters it was a big no, but that final confrontation was the book's highlight for me and now I'm considering to dwelve into the third instalment to find out the end of this story-arc.To all my friends who loved this book, and I know there are many of you, please don't be harsh on me.

Maas??How dare you, lady?? How dare you destroy me like that and then drink cups full of my salty tears like they are fine wine?? What kind of fucked up sadistic witchy ritual is this for you?You annihilate me with your cruel imagination. And because I’m a masochist, I love it. Keep going queen, I love this kind of pain.So, I couldn’t have picked a better time to read this but the quarantine time; all I did all day was reading this; I was being transported to this amazing world that I want to be part of right now – the Night Court is my eternal home from now on.“Stay here for however long you want. Stay here forever, if you feel like it.”It helped my mental health so much I am at a lack of words to express my gratitude.When I was younger, I used to read a lot of mythological stories and even though the Greek mythology confused the hell out of me, I had this fascination for some badass ladies. Amongst them were Persephone and her story. Yes, my cheesy heart loved that, okay?Persephone was the Bride of Spring, but she was stolen by the God of the Underworld – the terrible Hades – because he was head-over-heels in love with her. But she hated him with all her being until…she didn’t anymore. She learned to love his weird-ass too until he became her husband.If this isn’t the literary world’s foundation for their enemies-to-lovers theme, then I don’t know what this is, I give up.Well, this is the exact thing that happens inA Court of Mist and Fury. Rhys gets to be Hades (duh, obvy!) and Feyre is our darling Persephone. My brain started producing serotonin once again because of that tiny little fact some now happy beyond compare.This book is a love statement. Falling in love – slowly, truly, deeply, madly in love. And hard. But heart-crying beautiful. And it is not only about two beautiful creatures learning how to love each other and all the states they get through to find that love.This book teaches of how to fall in love with beautiful people, beautiful faces, beautiful minds and beautiful souls. And most importantly, how to fall in love with yourself. How to cherish everything you get to have in order to know how to soothe your life and spirit.“But then she snapped your neck.”Tears rolled down his face.“And I felt you die”, he whispered.Tears were sliding down my own cheeks.“And this beautiful, wonderful thing that had come into my life, this gift from the Cauldron…It was gone.”Don’t get confused though. This is still a Maas work of art and thus it is still very, very extremely hot. I can’t manage to launch into an explanation of how hot this book is because it is on fire, okay? And with this, SJM makes out of this book a full emotional experience (an emotional roller coaster better said but oh well).All of my favourite characters from this series make an appearance in this book. If you thought you loved the characters you encountered in the first book, then wait to be blown away by the apparition of the Inner Circle. They’re precious, deadly soft babies that I would want nothing more in life for them but to be fed, warm, cuddled and loved.-Cassianis the ruffian of my heart, he’s big and loud and gives off this feeling that he’ll keep you happy and safe no matter what; just love him so much;-Azrielis the baby-bat-guardian-angel of my soul whom I love so much and all I want to do in life is hug him and feed him and protect him from everything and everyone;-Amrenis a scary old bitch whom I love for the simple fact that she doesn’t seem to give a fuck about anyone but she’ll be ready to defend her friends if it comes to it;-Moris my girl-crush of this series and sometimes I think she’ll be my ultimate wine-drinking bestie; I love her to death;“A queen – a queen who bowed to no one, a queen who had faced them all down and triumphed. A queen who owned her body, her life, her destiny and never apologized for it.”All those weirdos are like a big, fat present for me, wrapped up in colourful paper and with a bow tied on top. I don’t know how I managed to go on with my life before I learned about their existence.Now, moving on to more serious, adult-like topics, I want to confess one thing: this book is extremely sensual. It really goes places and I went with it like in trance. The level of sexiness explored here is so intense that it could be made a masterpiece of sensually falling in love. And this is mainly because ofRhys.In this book, I honestly cared more about Rhys than I cared about all of the characters inA Court of Thorns and Roses. He is the sexiest thing I’ve ever encountered in my life and with this, I have discovered, he’s my type of man, no questions asked.“I have known many High Lords. Cruel ones, cunning ones, weak ones, powerful ones. But never one that dreamed. Not as he does.”It feels like he’s having his own personalised gravitational system and we simply happen to fly around like thebăgători-de-seamăthat we are, if I’m allowed to express myself as Romanian as possible.Rhysand and Feyre's falling in love journey is one of the most beautiful love stories this world could read about. It is so warm, but also so crushing. I love it. It’s like a most beautifully painted love dream.By the end ofthis– *vaguely gesturing towards everything ACOMAF is*– I felt tired, hurt and blurry-sighted. And truth be said, a bitsobby(a bit more). I’ve been hurt to my core.But I loved this book so much, honestly. And I’m thankful for the fact that it exists for me to read it.“We were a song that had been sung from the very first ember of light in the world.”""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '❝I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal. I was a survivor, and I was strong. I would not be weak, or helpless again. I would not, could not be broken. Tamed.❞A Court of Thorns and Roses was one of the first books I started reading that got me into Fantasy and reviewing books. Way back when this series, the Throne of Glass series, and Sarah J. Maas, herself, wasn\'t hyped up like there\'s no tomorrow. It was the first book I\'ve read by Sarah J. Maas and the reason I picked up the Throne of Glass series because I just needed more SJM in my life.I was satisfied with the way things ended in ACOTAR so when I heard that some ""changes"" were going to be made in A Court of Mist and Fury, I was a little disappointed. I was NOT a fan of the changes that were made in the Throne of Glass series which was why I haven\'t picked up Queen of Shadows yet even though the book has been sitting on my shelf since the day it\'s been released. That\'s just my opinion. I know some SJM fans are going to start pouncing because they sincerely believe that Sarah could absolutely do no wrong. Don\'t get me wrong, I LOVE SARAH J. MAAS. She is an outstanding author. I love her writing, her characters, and the world that she brings to life. It was her books that changed my perspective on Young Adult Fantasy, but I honestly wouldn\'t say that I agree with every direction that SJM takes with her books.I suppose the questions to ask now are: what was my stance at the end of ACOTAR and how did I perceive the changes that were made after reading ACOMAF?Let me address the most important aspect of Sarah J. Maas\'s books, this series, and probably the thing that majority of readers care about the most: THE ROMANCE. Since A Court of Thorns and Roses was a loose retelling of Beauty and the Beast, my ship of course was none other than Tamlin and Feyre. I loved them as individuals and I loved them even more as a couple. AND I loved Rhysand. Just not as a love interest. I felt like Feyre wasn\'t worthy of the enigma that was Rhysand. But knowing the trend that SJM follows in all of her books, I figured a change in love interests was inevitable. After all, a book isn\'t written by Sarah J. Maas if there isn\'t some character butchering and changes in love interests involved.But after reading A Court of Mist and Fury, I actually found myself accepting the transition in love interests much to my surprise. As much as I wanted Tamlin and Feyre to stay together, I knew it wasn\'t going to happen. These two people that survived weren\'t the same people that were Under the Mountain. They\'re relationship became such a nightmare and so unhealthy. It was two damaged lovers waiting for a disaster to happen.In the beginning of this series, I understood where Tamlin was coming from and why he was so protective of Feyre. It was for Feyre\'s own good and nobody wants to lose the people they love and/or care about. But he took it way too far. He became too overbearing to the point where he was holding Feyre back. We all understood the trials and suffering that Feyre had to go through but I feel like people don\'t acknowledge what Tamlin had to go through as well while they were Under the Mountain. It was nothing close to what Feyre had to go through but Tamlin had to watch the person he loved suffer and die. He couldn\'t protect her the way he wanted and he didn\'t fight for her as he knew he very well could have. He was helpless and a coward. I think he realized this, which was why he tried to make up for it afterwards by protecting her now to the point where she\'s being suffocated. It still doesn\'t excuse what Tamlin does in this book but he\'s just another damaged character like Feyre and Rhysand. He\'s just hurting in different ways and expressing that pain in a way the he views would make up for his shortcomings in the first book. Tamlin loves Feyre, that much is evident. He just loves her too much, and that is the tragedy.As for Rhysand, all I can say is that I loved him in ACOTAR and I loved him even more in A Court of Mist and Fury. I loved that we finally get a good understanding of Rhys as a character, the secrets he\'s kept, and the sacrifices he\'s made for the good of his people and his court. He was everything that Tamlin was not and twice the man and High Lord that Tamlin will ever be. I\'m not completely sure if I\'m 100% on board with Feyre and Rhysand yet but I love their chemistry, friendship, and the way they just understand and respect one another. I think I would\'ve been head over heels in love with Feyre and Rhys instantly as a couple if ACOTAR never happened and I didn\'t get so attached to Feyre and Tamlin. But I no longer ship Tamlin/Feyre and I\'m slowly, but surely, beginning to fall in love with Rhysand and Feyre little by little.With romance aside, everything about A Court of Mist and Fury turned out every bit as great as I anticipated a year ago. Sarah J. Maas did not disappoint. I was preparing myself for the worst but instead I got the best. Sarah really knows how to capture her audience with her writing, worldbuilding, and characters that she has created. Of all the new things that were introduced in this book, the new characters of the Night Court were definitely my favorite. I thought the Spring Court was great in ACOTAR with characters like Lucien and Alis but the Night Court was at a whole new level with Cassian, Azriel, Morrigan, and Amren. BADASS is literally an understatement describing these new characters.Besides Rhysand and Feyre, ACOMAF introduced so many new ships and I can\'t handle all the perfectness that everyone is. I now ship Mor and Azriel with all of my being, just putting it out there. XD And Cassian and Nesta. And Lucian and Elain. None for you Tamlin.Overall, I was glad I waited to read A Court of Mist and Fury because as a result, I was able to dive into the story with an open mind about the changes that were going to be made in terms of romance and the direction that Sarah J. Maas was taking the series. Love her or hate her, Sarah can write one hell of a story and is such an outstanding author. Although there were some parts of the book that went by a little slow, I think A Court of Mist and Fury was even better than ACOTAR in more ways than one. Sometimes I find that sequels may suffer ""middle book syndrome"" but ACOMAF amplifies that momentum knowing that Sarah is preparing to hurtle anticipation and suffering our way for the conclusion of the A Court of Thorns and Roses trilogy.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal.I was a survivor, and I was strong.Oh damn. That was so unexpectedly good. And to think I almost didn\'t take a chance on this after not loving the first book...So, here it is: I present to you7 reasons why this book is a million times better thanA Court of Thorns and Roses.1) Less romance.Oh, don\'t worry, there\'s romance. There\'slusty, slow-build, flirtatious romancethat somehow manages to be completely absent from the first book, even though romance was more central to the plot. But there\'s also so many other things here. It\'s a fantasy with romantic elements, not the other way around.I always say I tend to become more invested in love stories when they\'re subplots and the book itself is not actuallyaboutthe love story. I like it when the characters come together around and between all the rest of the action and drama. That\'s what\'s happening here. Because there is a whole shitstorm of other things going on - which, by the way, has led tobetter world-building, more exciting action and reveals, and a fascinating overarching story.2) Feyre\'s growth and development.And, in fact, the growth and development of many characters. Maas spends some quality time on character histories and backstory to strengthen our understanding of them. I absolutely love it when characters show realistic growth over time and I think that\'s especially important with Feyre here.Feyre is not the character she was duringA Court of Thorns and Roses. How could she be after the events of that book? Naturally, she has changed and found that her needs and aspirations have changed too. Once upon a time, back when she was weak and starving, she longed for a strong protector like Tamlin. Now she is strong, and she needs freedom to train her newfound strengths.3) I hate Tamlin.Honestly, if you happen to be a diehard Tamlin fan, I can see this book being a huge disappointment. Luckily for me, I pretty much despised him. He\'s never been anything but apretty-faced control freak. I\'m glad Feyre has seen that and rebelled against it.I should warn you that Tamlin is absent for about 70-80% of this book. And that was just fine by me!4) I love Rhysand.I foresee the ""oh no, it\'s a love triangle"" comments rolling in, but I really don\'t think it is. I actually think this is a great book aboutgrowing up and discovering that you\'re a different personwho longs for different things. I don\'t get the sense that Maas is trying to play out the Tamlin/Feyre/Rhysand angst; she is merely showing a young woman having a change of heart.AND can we just talk about how much better Rhysand is. There\'s all the superficial stuff like he\'sexciting, flirty, dangerousand I love the story behind him. He\'s more fun than Tamlin and I like fun. His banter is wonderful. But I\'m also talking about a more important level. Rhysand is, despite being the ""bad boy"", thoughtful and selfless. He doesn\'t want to stifle Feyre\'s strength and lock her away for her own protection - he wants her at his side, an equal, a partner in crime. And I love that so much.I like men who see value in strong women.5) Less sexual.I\'m sorry, you horny readers, but I just need to put this out there:I really dislike Maas\' sex scenes. Maybe Tamlin had something to do with it but, in general, I think they\'re overwritten and melodramatic. I also think she does a lot of ""telling"" you that it\'s hot, instead of ""showing"" how it is, which is a common writing mistake, but is far worse when in a sex scene. It\'s unconvincing.And by ""overwritten"", I mean that she describes kissing as ""branding"", thrusts as ""breaking"", and sex moans as ""prayers"". Literally none of those things are sexy. She gets the flirtations and banter right - that bit is hotter than the actual sex - but I start to cringe when the clothes come off.A brush of his tongue against the seam of my lips had me opening fully for him, and he swept in, claiming me, branding me.Also, is it really necessary for the male characters to ""growl in approval"" during sex? Not just once - and arguably one growl is one too many - but several times. I\'m supposed to be fanning myself with desire and all I can think about isRoy Orbison\'s Pretty Woman.Mercy. Rawr.6) New characters.A Court of Mist and Furyintroduces many new characters, and the difference between this book and the first is that I found them all memorable, not just the main three characters. Maas has definitely not neglected her characterization and character detailing here. Everyone who comes in and out of the novel has an important purpose, is fleshed out with personality and history, and makes an impact.My favourite was Amren, but I also loved Cassian and Azriel. Our brief introductions to the Bone Carver and the Weaver were highlights too.7) The ending.Take note: this is how to ensure your reader needs to get their hands on the next book. It\'s not a cliffhanger, but it is still EVIL. In the best possible way. I loved everything about it. It\'s the kind of emotional high that leaves you somewhere between wide-eyed horror and smiling gleefully.How will I last a whole year?Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube|Store'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Well, well, well. How the turns have tabled.ACOTAR was, uh...not my favorite book in the world.But there are no words to describe how much better ACOMAF is.All the problems I had with the first book were fixed. The story got bigger and more epic. The romance improved dramatically. And I fell in love with all the characters.This review has spoilers for the first book. Spoilers for ACOMAF will be boxed off with siren emojis (🚨).After the events Under the Mountain, Feyre is understandably traumatized. She saved Tamlin and the Spring Court at the cost of her own mental health. She had to kill innocent Fae to save him. And now she can\'t look at the color red without getting flashbacks. She wakes up every night to throw up.And Tamlin isn\'t helping.He\'s extremely protective of her after Amarantha killed her, even though Feyre was brought back stronger than ever as a High Fae. He doesn\'t allow her to talk to her family or to leave Spring Court land. He goes as far as to lock her in the house so she won\'t try to help the recovery effort in Prythian.And that\'s when she breaks. She calls out for anyone to save her, and Rhysand hears her through the bond, taking her to the Night Court to ride out the storm. But along the way, she realizes that she is more than a figurehead. She has powers, given to her by the High Lords when her body was remade. This book is essentially Feyre\'s journey to finding and accepting herself with Rhysand\'s help.Rhysand, High Lord of the Night Court, is not as he seems. In ACOTAR, we saw the facade he put on so Amarantha didn\'t get suspicious. But the real Rhys is a haunted, traumatized character who hates himself and feels worthless. He\'s exactly like Feyre. An excuse for Rhysand\'s past behavior is given, and it actually makes sense.Their journey to discovering themselves is beautiful, touching, and heartbreaking. And while I do hate Tamlin for being so heartless to Feyre, I can see where he\'s coming from and I don\'t think we should treat him like a villain.He\'s protective of Feyre because he saw her die, and he\'s absolutely terrified of that happening again. So he protects her the only way he knows how--by shutting her inside and not letting anyone see her. And it drives Feyre mad. I think there should have been a Tamlin redemption arc, and I really want to see Tamlin recovering from his PTSD as well. Because they\'re both suffering and they both deserve help. I don\'t want Tamlin to become the villain.However, the signs of emotional abuse and possible physical abuse are clearly evident.- Claws come out whenever Feyre confronts him- Makes her PTSD worse by locking her inside, giving her flashbacks to Under the Mountain- Doesn\'t take her opinions seriously- Doesn\'t listen to her, or kisses her or something to make her shut up- Gives her no responsibilitiesThe mental health rep was outstanding. Tamlin\'s rep was kind of harmful, but Feyre\'s was so raw and emotional and real.She didn\'t recover from her trauma because of love.She recovered because of friendship, and because people actually listened to her and took her seriously. Love was just a side effect.It\'s really the little things that helped. Feyre comforting Rhys during his nightmares and realizing that they were alike. Mor wearing blue instead of her favorite color (red) when she first meets Feyre. The Court of Dreams giving Feyre time to recover when she has a panic attack.The one thing I think this book needs is more diversity. Everyone was white except for this one guy that showed up for two chapters. The caucacity.🚨🚨🚨SPOILERS AHEAD🚨🚨🚨I did not like Rhysand\'s character after Feyre discovered the mating bond.This may have something to do with the fact that I don\'t like the idea of ""mates."" They\'re essentially soulmates, if you\'re not familiar with SJM. I always felt uncomfortable with the overprotectiveness that comes with the term and the kind of animalistic ring to the word itself.I actually really, really loved Rhys\'s character before he and Feyre were mates. He was so suave and intelligent and witty. That is, until the mating bond snapped into place. And then he was insanely overprotective and I just don\'t like that in a character.🚨🚨🚨SPOILERS HAVE ENDED🚨🚨🚨Another rap, because why not.

There\'s too much that happened and (whew) I am just wholly overwhelmed with everything.We last left Feyra as abroken shell of a girl- she survived trials and the hardships but her mind wasn\'t the same.

I just want to fill this review up with the heart-eye emojis.Minor spoilers will be included. You've been warned.This book is incredible. This book is important. But before I get to that, this book was a massive, gigantic improvement on ACOTAR. They're not even the same two books. Or they are, but ACOMAF elevated this series to what it deserved and needed to be.The world was epic, detailed and grand and I never wanted to leave. Everything about it clicked. I was absolutely transported into a world that I became obsessed and enthralled with. The pacing was beautifully slow, but well paced and the build up was great.So, the story line picks up right where it left off, with Feyre and Tamlin being back in the Spring Court, and now having to suffer from PTSD and anxiety. I absolutely love how SJM explored this and showcased how they were both affected by what happened in the events of the last book.Now, I was afraid that Tamlin's character was going to be completely bashed and written off since readers were hating on him and since I really liked his character in ACOTAR, that had me worried. But as I read on, the progression with his character made sense. As much as I loathed how he became, it's understandable and true to real life. His PTSD took on a different form. Sadly, that form became more emotionally abusive, manipulative and controlling. It was almost unbearable to even read. It was ugly but it needed to be there.Feyre just lost herself. She didn't know who she was anymore. Her trauma unfolded in a way that changed her completely and led her to who she truly needed to become.I absolutely loved how SJM incorporated those aspects into the story and how Feyre grew and continued to beautifully grow throughout the book. Facing setbacks, but ultimately, finding herself and her voice again. That 'human' element made it so relatable and warm. And the depth that SJM went into for both characters was impressive and you couldn't help but be invested and feel a strong sense of empathy.But what I loved more than anything was that SJM showed what a healthy and unhealthy relationship is. What to stand and not to stand for, depending on the standards you've set for yourself and which ultimately, you decide for yourself. 'Twas fuckin feminist as fuck, whilst also incorporating what true friendship and a healthy and loving relationship can do for your worth. To ultimately put your wellbeing ahead of everything so you may recognise the signs of an imbalanced relationship.And Rhysand? I need him in human form. Sometime soon, universe.This book just has so many fantastical and realistic elements to it. I loved that we were able to take something a way from it, enjoy it, and I'm even happier that SJM decided to extend this series.

I understand how people would consider the sequel to be an improvement since the main character shows more agency and certain tropes are reversed, but the development was very on-the-nose and came at the expense of turning other characters into cartoonish villains. The writing suffered a lot from telling and not showing, especially when it came to the dialogue, where it mostly consisted of the main character asking questions which would result in the other faeries answering via several pages of monologues in order to tell the exposition and characters’ background stories.

And a special hug goes to my dear friendSimona(click on the names to see girls\' reviews) You were right, dear, reading this book and, especially, discussing it is so much fun, indeed.First of all, let me show to you a simplediagram, where you can see how the level of my engagement toward this book...uh, plummeted (actually I wanted to make the diagram more vertical, but, well, I am not good with graphic stuff) with every chapter until nothing was left for me to enjoy.And let me tell you it was a rather bumpy and painful ride.Now, let\'s clarify a few things:- I am not a fan of ACOTAR. You can see inmy reviewwhy.- I had few expectations starting this book... ah hell, I had THE ONLY expectation - Rhysand.-I do not hate this book, I dislike it.<----- I am close to hating it now.This review is probably going to be a mess of thoughts with no structure, so I am sorry in advance if it\'s confusing, I just wanted to splash out my disappointment.I liked Rhys in the previous book; I liked his darkness. I knew he was not evil and had his reasons to act as he did, and I wanted to know why. I wanted him and Feyre together. But turns out, me and Rhys are never going to happen, not because he acts OOC (out of character) - after finishing the book, I know that he didn\'t act OOC - I dislike his sugary nature; there\'s too much goodness in him, he is practically a Saint: hell, he is the Saint among Fae!“We are lucky to have him, Feyre.” I turned from the door. “I have known many High Lords,” Amren continued, studying her paper. “Cruel ones, cunning ones, weak ones, powerful ones. But never one that dreamed. Not as he does.”“Dreams of what?” I breathed.“Of peace. Of freedom. Of a world united, a world thriving. Of something better—for all of us.”Of course, the other High Lords are stupid, they don\'t see the war coming, they are not interested in peace and prosperity, only Rhys does everything, and no one wants to listen to him.Poor baby.And let\'s not forget he is the strongest Fae out there.Here—here was the most powerful High Lord ever born.The face of dreams and nightmares.Only throughout the book, there was more than one situation where his ""mighty"" powers let him down.The question: why make him so powerful, impossibly so, if a little bit of vulnerability could\'ve made him more real and likable, and suited the plot better. It\'s unnatural to be that good. He became a cardboard character with no backbone and lives only to serve Feyre, it seems.But, fuck, it wasn\'t even my biggest issue. I hated how Maascompared Tam and Rhys in this book all the time. I never liked Tam, but, seriously, how much shit you can splash on one person before he turns into shit himself? I pity Tam and what Maas did to him. Time and again Maas shoves down our throats how Rhys excels Tam in everything: Tam didn\'t want to talk to Feyre about his nightmares. Rhys wanted to talk and share. Tam never held her hair while she vomited her guts out every night (she does it a lot, by the way, nauseatingly so). Rhys held her hair and cuddled her:He never woke when the nightmares dragged me from sleep; never woke when I vomited my guts up night after night. If he knew or heard, he said nothing about it.Large, warm hands pulled my hair back a moment later.“Breathe,” Rhys said. “Imagine them winking out like candles, one by one.”I heaved into the toilet again, shuddering as light and heat crested and rushed out of me, and savored the empty, cool dark that pooled in their wake.Tam locked her up in the house and forbade her to participate in any action. Rhys allowed her to do whatever she wanted. Tam didn\'t let her visit his rooms. Rhys invited her to his;With Tamlin, he’d kept his own rooms and slept in mine. And I supposed—I supposed it’d be the same.I was almost to my bedroom door when Rhysand drawled from behind me, “We can use your room if you like, but … ” He was leaning against his open bedroom door. “Either your room or mine—but we’re sharing one from now on. Just tell me whether I should move my clothes or yours. If that’s all right with you.”Tam is starving his people. Rhys\'s people prosper (he probably gives them food for free). Tam said there are no High Ladies in Prythian. Rhys made Feyre High Lady of Night Court. Comparisons were in EVERYTHING like the author couldn\'t stop shoving up our asses how Tam is lesser than Rhys in every aspect you can think of. And all this is solely for Feyre to make it easier to dump Tam and switch to Rhys.Then there\'s Feyre and herlovesex life. Feyre said that she fell for the first guy who showed kindness to her.I’m thinking that I was a lonely, hopeless person, and I might have fallen in love with the first thing that showed me a hint of kindness and safety.But she can\'t - wouldn\'t - admit that it wasn\'t love that she felt for Tamlin. She, time and again, repeats it was love: she loved and sacrificed and then forgot the guy in two months\' time. I would\'ve respected her more if she admitted that it was lust.He buried his face in my neck and said onto my nape, as if the words would be absorbed by my body, as if he could only say it the way we’d always been good at communicating—skin to skin.Whyfeel guiltyabout wanting another male? But no, Feyre is Mary Sue, she can\'t be the simple girl who had a change of heart. She loved but had serious reasons to fell out of love.Easy-peasy. Heck, I would\'ve respected her more if she was an elite prostitute serving High Lords and choosing her next lover without shame or labeling lust as love. But she is a hypocrite and Ihate hypocrites. It leads me to my next issue.Feyre/Rhysand. Honestly, I don\'t believe Tam loved Feyre, no, they just had a comfy agreement: fuck but don\'t ask questions. Rhys, on the other hand, I believe he really loved her. What about her? No. I am still not convinced it was love from Feyre\'s side; lust - yes. Again,Feyre has a pattern: when Rhys was a bad guy, she hated him, but when he started doing good stuff for her, she realized how good he is, how kind (don\'t forget this all is in comparison with Tam like we are stupid kids and can\'t fathom the universal truth: Rhys is good, Tam is bad);Feyre doesn\'t ""love"" Rhys despite his flaws, she ""loves"" him because he has no flaws.Mr. Purrfect Perfection. And when she finally admits she wants him, she still acts like a hypocrite by saying, ""But I loved Tam, deeply, I just don\'t any longer, because he treated me badly (I still don\'t get how splashing some paint on walls and locking her up once is abusive and the reason to easily fall out of love)."" Did you love him indeed? I want to ask for the thousandth time. Feyre just says she loved him to find an excuse to fuck Rhys. And that leads us to theirmating bond.When Feyre finds out they are mates, she relaxes and thinks, ""Fuck, what a relieve now that I know Tam and I was never going to happen, I don\'t have to feel guilty any longer for wanting to fuck Rhys"". But before we cover the mating process, let\'s touch on the snotty conversation they had. If you still had any doubts before that Rhys is a Saint, believe now that he is. He is a miracle reborn. Attention: he was always kind to Feyre even when he was a dick toward her. He loved her already when they were under the Mountain, he knew they are mates, it wrecked him to hurt her; he was jealous of unworthy Tam, but Rhys was noble and didn\'t want to ruin Feyre\'s life. And that sloppy melodramatic speech of his continues for a whole chapter!""A Court of snort and boredom""as someone on GR called it once (sorry, I don\'t remember who said that or I\'d hug this person). And again, Rhy\'s goodness is shoved down our throats *gags*Mate.My—mate.This beautiful, strong, selfless male … Who had sacrificed and wrecked himself for his family, his people, and didn’t feel it was enough, that he wasn’t enough for anyone.Also, as we are on the topic... did you noticehow many times the phrase""my mate""is repeated in the book?!Hundreds of times! It\'s like a broken record player. I think if I hear ""mate"" one more time I may vomit like our Feyre-parrot does all the time.They fuck. It\'s a disaster of epic proportions. Mountain quacked. MOUNTAIN. QUACKED. Seriously? What was that? Some kind of cheap shapeshifter porn?Okay, When they are done, and I am done yawning, and we all move to civilized surroundings... wait, what the fuck is happening?!Rhys acts like an animal, he can\'t stop wanting to screw Feyre. Their mating bond makes them horny as fuck. He is so protective of his female. It\'s serious stuff among Fae folk, they could even kill if another male looks sideways at their females.“The … frenzy,” he said carefully, as if fearful the wrong word might send us both hurtling for each other before we could get sustenance into our bodies. “When a couple accepts the mating bond, it’s … overwhelming. Again, harkening back to the beasts we once were. Probably something about ensuring the female was impregnated.” My heart paused at that. “Some couples don’t leave the house for a week. Males get so volatile that it can be dangerous for them to be in public, anyway. I’ve seen males of reason and education shatter a room because another male looked too long in their mate’s direction, too soon after they’d been mated.”Faeries - cunning, highly intelligent, powerful creatures act as if they are primitive animals from a cheap porn novel. After Rhys loses some steam fighting his buddy, he goes and fucks Feyre against the table. Everyone outside hears and knows. Wonders! How civilized they are indeed! Are we supposed to find these animal games romantic? Does it suppose to be a healthy relationship?And this book is labeled as YA and published by Bloomsbury Children\'s!It is NA (new adult) or erotic at the very least!My next issue - the plot. First of all, let\'s not delude ourselves there\'s something more to the book apart from theromancemating.The plot is a crutch for the romance.Everything characters do, they do between Rhys\'s and Feyre\'s courting. And even these parts are poorly executed. Why, oh why, does Maas need to chew everything for us?! We are not stupid, we can get hints and would like to have some space left for the imagination.Show, don\'t tell.Show us through hints and glances, make us work for information; make us want to know! And the plot itself is primitive: go there, do that - monotone routine with no unexpected parts. 50% into the book and I have already known how everything would end.I don\'t understand the half-orgy scene in the Court of Nightmares where Feyre and Rhys were almost fucking while everyone watched. It was a distraction while the others were stealing something important. It\'s so stupid I can\'t even. Maas couldn\'t think of something smart for distraction, rather than thisdisgusting humiliating scene?! The best part is the ending, though. Why would mortal queens conspire with the King of Hybern? Because they want immortality? They\'ll get their immortality but will be slaves. Would it be worth it? I don\'t think so. And why demonstrate the experiment with humans turning into Fae twice? Wasn\'t one time enough, when Feyre\'s sister Elain was made into Fae? Why make the same with Nesta? Because it serves Maas\'s idea of making Feyre\'s sisters immortal and finding mighty mates for them. It doesn\'t matter that the plot looks illogical and stretched - everything is ideal for Maas\'s grand plans. Tam is a traitor because he wants Feyre back. Why, he is a reborn villain now! How stupid it is to betray your country, because of the woman who doesn\'t want you? Why villains in this book so villainous? Why there\'s no depth to them? Good is good, bad is bad. End of conversation.This book is 640 pages long. 640 pages of unnecessary descriptions of clothes, Rhys\'s goodness, Tam badness, Feyre\'s vomiting, mating, getting from point A to point B. 640 pages of parading High Lords to who I wouldn\'t trust to rule a swamp, let alone whole Kingdoms. Where\'s the smart and cunning in this book? And what kind of place is Night Court? Is it a mix of East and West and the modern world? Lace underwear, seriously?! Why does Night Court resemble so much human reality? Is this another point to Rhys\'s goodness? I have tons of questions toward this book, but I don\'t think getting my answers will somehow make it better. It\'s late for that.I wouldn\'t say there wasn\'t anything good about the book for me. Compared to Rhys and Feyre I liked secondary characters, and Cass and Nesta as a couple attract me more than Rhys and Feyre ever will. It\'s sad I am not interested in learning more about them in the context of this series.When I started this book, I practically had no expectations, and now I am angry. Angry at the book I wasn\'t even sure I would read in the first place! It\'s a new low. If this book was an erotic novel or NA, I would say, ""Good, we had sexy time"" - and move on. But this book pretends to be something different than it really is. Something more meaningful and deep, and it cruelly deceives people into thinking they are going to read a fantasy YA with a strong plotline and character development. They will be surprised to find an entirely different beast here. I am glad I am finally done with this series:no more, never again, burn in hell, book.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Re-read via audio!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '""When you spend so long trapped in darkness, you find that the darkness begins to stare back.""Yall... this book... this book and its hype... this book and its hype and all it\'s spoilers;\xa0had me worried.\xa0On\xa0top of all that\xa0I\xa0feared that this book, all 600 plus pages, would suffer a massive case of second book syndrome. I\'m so freaking happy to finally say that this book was AMAZING!As I do with most my on-going series reviews I\'m going to keep this review spoiler\xa0free. Since this book was broken up in several sections I\'m\xa0going to basically break my review down by that.A Court of Mist and Furyis the second book in theA Court of Throns and Rosesseries. This book starts off right where ACOTAR ended. Feyre, however, isn\'t recovering well from what happened to her under the mountain. It doesn\'t help that Tamlin basically avoids talking about it at all cost and he insist that she never leaves the estate. Being trapped in the house just\xa0wedding planning, with no friends, no family, and waiting for the moment when Rhys comes to claim her for their deal. Feyre is a broken girl the first part of this book. Not knowing where she stands or where she wants to be. So many things happen in the first half of this book, all leading up to Rhys finally coming to get her. That\'s all I\'m really going to say about the first\xa0section\xa0of this\xa0book.The next part of this book we finally get a lot of\xa0the answers we\'ve been dying for! Answers about Rhys and why he is the way he is, we finally get to see the Night Court, we get to find out so much history on all the other courts, and oh so much more. We are also introduced to so many new side characters... Which easily\xa0became some of my all time favorites. Mor, Amren, Cassian, and Azriel brought everything to this story! I loved that Rhys decides to surround himself with the best of the best, say F the people who don\'t see females as badass, and puts two fierce girls as part of his inner circle. Cassian and Azriel, be still my beating heart. I loved these two. What interesting characters. Each with such a unique back story.\xa0This part of the book was all about build up and setting the stage for the ending.\xa0This is why it took me awhile to get through this book... but trust me get through it, its so wroth it.The last part\xa0of this book... God give me strength! I don\'t know how I\'m even going to get through the rest of this review. This section of the book was everything I ever wanted! There is action, suspense, romance, history, and\xa0twist. Everything that was building up from the first parts were perfect set up for this to be a big bang. There were also so many things that\xa0I thought were minor details in the first book that\xa0turned out to be huge reveals in this one.\xa0I was also so worried that the ""love triangle"" aspect still hanging in the air that it would end up ruining things for me. I can\'t not address it, and I swear it\'s not a spoiler, but allthe romance in this is PERFECT. It\'s also why this book is so much bigger than the first, because it\'s so full of sexy fun times.This book is hot, HOT! I really don\'t get how this book is still categorized as Ya, I think this jumped right into NA. Seriously, so yummy! I have for sure gotten on the same ship as everyone else.The ending. So much happens. It was so amazing. Shit hits the fan! I did not see it coming. I knew one thing that was going to happen, because you can\'t not see it, but the rest of it had me on the edge of my seat. I kept screaming ""WTF"" The whole time. Like really, what just happened?!?! Those last two chapters though. Those last two chapters were.... Lord! Oh and that last paragraph! That last sentence!!!! Lets just say it was the most epic!!!I wish my review was a little more detailed, and sorry if it\'s all over the place, but that\'s how this book made me feel. A messy, disorganized, and a hot mess. I can\'t wait till book three.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'MIND=BLOWNMy hysteria is threatening to break me and I wonder if it is possible to die of elation. I\'m frozen in 35646 layers of disbelief and I\'m trying hard not to explode from the sheer impossibility of this flawless story I\'ve read. I read, read, read, and read until I reached the Acknowledgements page and knew for sure that I finished the best book I\'ve read in like... an eternity.The story is simple, really. It picks up right where it left off inA Court of Thorns and Roses.Feyre is living in the Summer court and is going to marry Tamlin. But things have changed since she has turned into High Fae, an immortal body but with a human heart: She has to stay by Tamlin\'s side and be his trophy, left with nothing to do but paint and plan her wedding with Tamlin, High Lord of the Spring Court. As she grapples with the horrors she\'s had to endure Under The Mountain against Amarantha, she also awaits Rhysand, with whom she struck a bargain to visit his Night Court for one week every month.A Court of Mist and Furywas magical. Angsty. AndDamnably beautiful.Theplotwas so tangible, I didn\'t want to get it over with. Theromancewas so tantalizing, I felt my heart pound frantically in my chest. Theambiencewas soalluring, I struggled to take my eyes off it. And thetwistswere sounexpected, I was forced to gawk and stare at the ceiling, due to relief or stupefaction, I don\'t know. I was thoroughly enchanted in a world filled with intrigue, magic, lies, and secrets and I feel weighed down by the depth of it.Sarah J. Maas\'s writing is the literal definition ofmagnificent.She creates a world so captivating and lets you drown in waves ofwonderand intrigue,enigmaand appeal. Her words are powerful, heavy with conviction, articulate, and relevant. I can\'t thank her enough for delivering this masterpiece and much more. And for introducing me to two of the best characters I can\'t stop fangirling over.Rhysand.High Lord of the Night Court; Beautiful, brutal, and powerful. He appears to be cold and arrogant initially, occasionally cracking jokes about his beauty. He is surrounded by an aura of sensuality and vivacity and he handles even the direst of situations with grace, casually yet courteously. He is as dangerous and ferocious as he is subtle and generous. He hides behind a mask of savagery and manipulation, trickery and deception but beneath the mask, he\'s kind and humble, a High Lord who cares for his people more than he deigns to express.Feyre.Our strong protagonist who develops from being oblivious in the first book to someone who didn\'t need to be coddled, pampered or protected, who didn\'t cravestabilityandcomfort, orluxuryandeasiness. She hates being judged based on her human life. She can be compassionate, affectionate, and loving, but she can also be vicious, seductive, and cunning as she sees fit. Extremely short-tempered and sometimes provocative, she makes for her shortcomings by being powerful, warm, and unbelievably loyal (Ironic, as she keeps calling herself atraitor)I really liked Tamlin inA Court of Thorns and RosesI thought I\'d be devastated by not seeing him with Feyre. But the author made it easy for me to dislike him as he wanted to lock Feyre up, keep her as his trophy and suffocate her by being overprotective.""Love was balm as much as it was poison""The reason why Feyre had been hopelessly in love with Tamlin could\'ve been because of the fact that she was lonely and desired company and so fell for the first person who showed her a hint of kindness and offered commiseration and safety.Whereas Rhysand was different, he gave Feyre the freedom to choose what she desired and believed in her capabilities. He soundlessly, silently, fought for her. A perfect gentleman.""He locked you up because he knew- the bastard knew what treasure you are. That you are worth more than land and jewels.The story also shows us how much our first impression of people/ things could be wrong in the form of role reversals in the male protagonist. Rhysand, who I once perceived as a manipulator, liar, and a ""shameless flirt"" unveils his identity mask and shows how considerate and sacrificing he can be for the people he cares about. I\'m glad I could see a whole new depth to his character, that despite being hard as a shell on the outside, he too had moments of weakness wherein he needed consolation.The book was in support of feminism andequality.It also shows how one can go to any extent to protect their friends and loved ones whilst also exemplifying thatyou can choose your family.Cassian, Azriel, Amren, and Mor were amazing support systems and I\'d give anything to meet them in real life.I could keep going on and on about it, but I think I will peace out for now. 😁✌️'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I don’t even know what to say.

The most prominent one though, the one that glows with the fire of a thousand suns, is how—even as a cheasy, romantic fairytale—this book is more painful and human due to themes of trauma and mental health than both its predecessor and its inspirations:Beauty and the BeastturnedHades and Persephone.“To the stars who listen—and the dreams that are answered.”With anexpanded yet still fairytalish (meaning less defined rules) world,emotional, dramatic, flowing, thread-of-thought writing, andnew, captivating, and steal-your-heart-stab-you-in-the-dark characters and dynamicson top ofthemes of depression, abuse, and post traumatic stress disorder, ACoMaF really has much to talk about.Shall we begin to dig in?“[I knew that] I would never be a gentle grower of things, or someone who burned like fire—but that I would be quiet and enduring and as faceted as the night. That I would have beauty, for those who knew where to look, and if people didn’t bother to look, but to only fear it...then I didn’t particularly care for them, anyway.”Mental Health:How We Can Inflict Pain While in Pain➥PTSD, Depression, and (Possibly) BPD with Feyre & TamlinOne of the first things people criticiseA Court of Mist and Furyfor is Tamlin—some say his actions came out of the blue, while others agree that he was acting according to character but SJM made him an unnecessary villain when he could’ve been given support to heal. So before I discuss Feyre’s mental health issues and their representation, I’m going to address those two groups of people.“I am drowning. And the more you do this...you might as well be shoving my head under the water.”➤Do Tamlin’s choices come out of the blue?The answer is a simple no, and here’s why: Even inA Court of Thorns and Roses,Tamlin was a controling, aggressive, uncommunicative person who did not know how to truly listen or speak, how to be considerate and open. This makes sense because not only was he not taught any of those traits, he also experienced trauma and abuse growing up.He is extremely emotional and has no idea how to control those emotions, all while having learned to ignore his feelings because only ruthlessness equals survival and efficiency. This is unhealthy for a myriad of reasons, least of which is the fact that,no matter how willfully and insistently you turn away from your emotions, they never go away—closing your eyes so you might not see them doesn’t mean they aren’t there, it just means they’ll pounce on you in your greatest moments of weakness and you simply won’t see them coming.“The issue isn’t whether he loved you, it’s how much. Too much. Love can be a poison.”Tamlin is lonely and broken and living behind a wall of mistrust and fear, not knowing how to tear down that wall nor even acknowledging its existence. I have a couple of friends who struggle with Borderline Personality Disorder and, while I don’t want to diagnose anyone here, he actually reminded me of one of them. I will elaborate, bear with me.➤Is Tamlin’s arc unnecessary and unrealistic?That is a straight up no, because of the aforementioned friend. Much like my friend, Tamlin neither wants to acknowledge that he needs help, nor does he want to be vulnerable enough toacceptanyone’s help. Do I think he is broken beyond repair? No, no one is broken beyond repair.Our scars, however ugly, are what make us beautiful, and the cracks in a broken glass can be filled with gold, healed to become something new.But do I think he could’ve healed in this book with the help of Feyre and Lucien? Again no, because of two reasons.“There is the darkness that frightens, the darkness that soothes, the darkness that is restful.” I pictured each. “There is the darkness of lovers, and the darkness of assassins. It becomes what the bearer wishes it to be, needs it to be. It is not wholly bad or good.”❶ I’ve personally grappled with mental illnesses for years and have friends both online and offline suffering who I’ve walked this path with, dragged back from the edge of suicide, and given help and solutions to when they hurt themselves and others so they could heal. I’ve also made a very, very unhealthy choice again and again and put aside my healing to be everyone’s full-time therapist. Anyone who was in pain? I would roll up my sleeves, telling them to come seek me out whenever and for whatever, and put all my energy in the ring when they did.Now, I’ve learned something from my online big sis Cath:You areno one’s therapist(unless that’s your job ofc). And Feyre did what she could to give Tamlin the space and support he needed, but she was also suffering herself and it’s cruel and infuriating to expect her to completely forget about her own pain and force him to heal when he isn’t truly accepting or seeking help. Which is the 2nd reason.“Sweep it under the rug, like everything else.”❷It’s one thing to support and help a friend towards healing, and it’s another thing toheal them. You can’t save a drowning man who refuses to take your hand. You could jump in, grab them, and swim to shore—but there’s a high chance they would drown you, too, in their attempt to get you off them.Again, I have done this, and it’s wrong because not only was I taking away their choice and saying that I know better (which I don’t, it’s their life) I was also risking them drowning me—I don’t much care about this, let me drown who cares, but it’s not healthy behaviour.Still, I’ve done it, put life and breath and soul into showing those drowning friends why they should seek a hand to stop their drowning and learn to swim, and I’ve failed as many times as I’ve succeeded. That friend I mentioned Tamlin reminded me of? She’s one where I failed, and all I could do was watch her in pain as she lashed out and inflicted pain on others, and try my best to do damage control with her victims—because theywerevictims, as Feyre clearly is one.A victim of abuse rooted in ignored, festering pain, twisting a caring, passionate soul into a source of suffering.“There are good days and hard days for me—even now. Don’t let the hard days win.”Now that that is out of the way, how about Feyre’s struggles?➤Above all else, this book is a love letter to healing.I can’t personally vouch for the PTSD (which I found accurately written based on what I’d learned of it from others’ experiences), but I can tell you about depression. And I can tell you how heartwrenchingly Feyre’s suffocating blanket of silence that cruelly embraced her and hauled her beneath the sea resonated with me. I will leave the exploration and healing to Sarah J. Maas. Thank you.Friendship:Why We Need Support to Heal➥Rhys, Mor, Amren, Azriel, and Cass Vs. LucienI think the second best thing about ACoMaF, beside its rep, was its characters and their dynamics. More specifically, the Court of Dreams. I find that name too cheesy to swallow so from now on I’m referring to them as the Gang #sorrynotsorry.“I have so many things to deal with that I’m sometimes tempted to unleash my power across the world and wipe the board clean. Just to buy me some damned peace.”#relatable✦Rhysandmight not be my number one (or two, or even three) character in this series, but that does not mean I don’t love him, it just shows how many amazing characters grace the pages of this book—because Idolove him.He might be arrogant and teasing and always seem in control, but underlying that facade is a deeply rooted insecurity and self doubt.They do say the most seemingly arrogant people in the room are the least confident ones (I mean, I hope they do and I didn’t just creates a saying out of the blue).Confidence means believing in yourself even as you mess up, and Rhys might be arrogant but he’s not confident—his every mistake and misstep are worms he lets devour him from the inside out. And he does make mistakes, because he is not perfect, just as no one is; he is a person who, in his drive to protect and give and give andgivefrom himself until he is bled dry, tends to occasionaly refuse to share what he knows and others should be informed of. What’s most important though is howhe accepts, apologises, and learns from his mistakes because what he values most is freedom of individuals to choose the path they want to walk.“You remain your own person. You decide your fate—your choices. Not me. You chose yesterday. You choose every day. Forever.”✦Amrenwith her no-nonsense, practical, I-will-sooner-kill-you-than-coddle-you attitude is my real number one, because this unyielding Tiny Ancient One would tear the world to pieces to fight for what she holds dear—though you wouldn’t guess what it is she values with her general cutting reply to everything around her.“I once lived in a place where the opinion of others mattered. It suffocated me, nearly broke me. [...] with enough courage, you can say to hell with a reputation. You do what you love, what you need.”✦Mortakes the spot as my 2nd fave right next toAzriel; where one is fire and boldness and charisma, the other is ice and silence and an enigma, and both will have your back and front and sides all the way to the threshold of death—and beyond. And then there is babyCassianwith his insufferable arrogance and heart of marshmallows that will push you and be there to catch you if you fall. (I need to add that I will take my hope for a polyamorous relationship between these three with their complicated, enchanting dynamic to the grave and hold it close through whatever comes next).✦ But why are they so important to Feyre’s healing?Because you can’t heal alone. I’ve tried it, and the road is rockier and more precarious without a shoulder to lean on and a hand to hold.I’m still learning to not cringe at taking a hand to walk the path (and failing, not gonna lie) but I nevertheless appreciate how breathtakingly SJM writes these journeys of recovery every. damn. time. You need friends to heal, and you need to help friends to heal.“I wonder if, even in my despair and hopelessness, I was never truly alone. I wonder if I was looking for this place—looking for you all.”✦ That’s whereLucienfails. I love him and his loyal heart, but sometimes you need to check your loyalty—sometimes the people and values you are holding on to are breaking something rare and fragile.That’s the precise issue with Lucien: He does not understand the depth of Feyre’s pain, if he had, he would’ve fought without backing down, getting up each time he hit the ground, because my baby is not a coward. Alas, people don’t ever really grasp another’s invisible pain.Romance:Where Love Can Bloom(SPOILER ALERT)➥Instalove or Slow Burn, featuring Feysand“I’m thinking, that I look at you and feel like I’m dying. Like I can’t breathe.”Rhysand and Feyre are not my fave couple as their dynamic is too sweet and romantic for me personally. However, it takes nothing away from howyoufeelthem fall in love, like a flower blooming and a freezing pair of hands finding colour next to the miracle of fire, or like the warmth and light of a familiar embrace you fall into in a world of cold, dark unknowns.Some readers accuse the mating bond of being instalove in the case of Rhysand falling for Feyre. Did they read chapter 54? Rhysand fell for her as she was a human surviving Under the Mountain, and everything he did before that was him trying to save an innocent girl he suspected of being his mate but did not specifically feel anything towards.In the end, mayhaps this book is too romantic for me, the aromantic with a heart of ice, to ever be my #1 book of all time, it nonetheless makes a comfortable and cozy den in its corner becauseA Court of Mist and Furyis a fairytale that takes the dashing princes and magic, and replaces it with human suffering and healing.“You think I don’t know how stories get written—how this story will be written? I am the dark lord, who stole away the bride of spring. I am a demon, and a nightmare, and I will meet a bad end. He is the golden prince–the hero who will get to keep you as his reward for not dying of stupidity and arrogance.”CompanionsBook series playlist:Spotify URLBooks in series:➴A Court of Thorns and Roses(ACoTaR, #1) ★★★✯☆➴ A Court of Mist and Fury (ACoTaR, #2) ★★★★★➴A Court of Wings and Ruin(ACoTaR, #3) ★★★★☆➴A Court of Frost and Starlight(ACoTaR, #3.1) ★★★☆☆➴Untitled Novella(ACoTaR, #3.2) ☆☆☆☆☆➴A \u200bCourt of Silver Flames(ACoTaR, #4) ☆☆☆☆☆'}]"

Convincing Anh that Olive is dating and well on her way to a happily ever after was always going to take more than hand-wavy Jedi mind tricks: Scientists require proof. So, like any self-respecting biologist, Olive panics and kisses the first man she sees.That man is none other than Adam Carlsen, a young hotshot professor--and well-known ass. Which is why Olive is positively floored when Stanford's reigning lab tyrant agrees to keep her charade a secret and be her fake boyfriend. But when a big science conference goes haywire, putting Olive's career on the Bunsen burner, Adam surprises her again with his unyielding support and even more unyielding... six-pack abs.Suddenly their little experiment feels dangerously close to combustion. And Olive discovers that the only thing more complicated than a hypothesis on love is putting her own heart under the microscope.","[{'rating': 1, 'content': ""I want to say this is a case of “It’s not the book, it’s me.” But then again, isn’t that the case for every book we end up disliking that everyone else enjoyed?The Love Hypothesisfollows Olive, a PhD student who wants to prove to her best friend that she has moved on and is dating. With no way to prove it, she kisses the first man she sees, which ends up being none other than Dr. Carlsen, known as one of the most unapproachable and critical professors. With his own reasoning, he agrees to become Olive’s fake boyfriend. But what starts as a fake relationship and fake feelings later turns into what Olive wishes were real instead.Olive is a woman in STEM, but that is really all she is. I admit, I loved this representation, and her experience as a scholar conducting research felt realistic, especially considering she’s not American (she’s Canadian), she’s not male, and she’s pretty young (26). Most of these end up being boundaries for young folk pursuing PhD careers in America, and it’s impressive to see representation like this. This was probably my favorite part of the book because Olive tells us how it’s been difficult for her to participate in a rigorous program like this, from being denied opportunities, not being believed in, to being seen as inferior, all because she’s a young woman in a predominantly male-dominated curriculum. While I’m not a STEM student, I even see it myself in the political field I study in. Men teach most classes, most advisors and major professors are also male, most students in classes end up being men, and everything else is usually male-dominated.Other than that, there was nothing.One part of the problem is Adam himself. Adam felt very, verybland.It was difficult to understand his personality and the type of person he was other than moody and sullen because it’s something we are constantly and repeatedly told, especially from Olive. I usually like fictional men like him, even if the way he acts and looks is nothing new, but this case didn’t work for me.You could say he needed much more seasoning.Not only that, but by visualizing what I read, I couldn’t picture Olive for the life of me. All I remember from her is that she is a PhD student in the Biology Department at Stanford University, is Canadian, 5”8, and I guess she has brown hair based on the cover. And . . . yeah, that’s it. Visually, I could envision Adam more than Olive, yet we spend the entire book in Olive’s mind (since it’s told from her point of view). This all ties back to the writing and how difficult it was to enjoy the book more because of how little description was given to the characters. Adam, for instance, felt like he needed more personality. I understand him being sullen and broody is part of it (which, as I’ve said before, is perfectly fine with me and understandable), but I feel like it has to do less with that and more with just the mere fact that Adam is just . . . Adam. The whole book, we don’t really know what Olive looks like or what she likes, and all we know about Adam is that he is ayoung, hot-shot professorwho hardly ever smiled and went through tough situations as a PhD student himself. Oh, and we can’t forget that he’s big, especially when you’re reminded every fucking page.That was it.Speaking of, Olive’s personality also felt a little childish sometimes.The situation that led to Olive kissing Adam (without knowing, of course) is completely unrealistic, so it’s one you need to put your logic to the side for.It made no sense to me how a PhD student, one who is researching pancreatic cancer in one of the best Biology departments of the United States, would kiss a random man she saw in the hallway because she wants to prove to her best friend that she truly is over the boy her best friend wants to date.Because . . . yeah, that’s the actual situation.Olive’s best friend, Anh, wants to date Jeremy, Olive’s ex. Olive is over him and wants nothing to do with him, but Anh thinks it’s breaking the girl code by dating Jeremy, even though Olive knows Anh really likes Jeremy. So to prove that she’s over him and is dating someone else, she kisses Adam when she sees the opportunity that Anh can see them.Pretty unrealistic scenario for a PhD student, if you ask me.Also, it’s not exactly stated, but Olive may or may not be in the asexual spectrum, specifically demisexuality. It’s briefly mentioned in the beginning (even the term is used) and when she and Adam are about to have sex, she mentions to Adam,“It’s not that I want to not have sex. I just . . . don’t particularly want to have it. There is something weird about my brain, and my body, and—I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but I don’t seem to be able to experience attraction like other people. Like normal people. I tried to just . . . just to do it, to get it over with, and the guy I did it with was nice, but the truth is that I just don’t feel any . . .” She closed her eyes. This was difficult to admit. “I don’t feel any sexual attraction unless I actually get to trust and like a person, which for some reason never happens. Or, rarely. It hadn’t, not in a long time, but now—I really like you, and I really trust you, and for the first time in a million years I want to—”For starters, I literally got second-hand embarrassment, and second, I can’t help but wish it was was expanded more on. It was as if the author just wanted to add more to Olives lacking personality so she sprinkled some pretty damn humiliating ace representation.Many people might not realize how ignorant it really is when you take a misrepresented and underrepresented sexual orientation and make your character say “there is something wrong with [her] brain,” making it seem like she “isn’t normal” because she experiences sexual attraction differently than “normal people”. Saying this is stereotypical, ignorant, and generally rude.Part of these quibbles made the romance more unrealistic and less believable. I had everything I love: professor x student, grumpy x sunshine, and fake dating.But all good things must come to an end.Because of the inability to imagine Olive, not appreciate an unseasoned broody man, and express concern over a PhD student's attitude at certain times, the romance also failed. There were definitely some of the good moments I love in a romance: the firstrealkiss, feeling the comfort of the other’s touch, realizing you’re falling for for someone you thought you would only see for 10 minutes, but the chemistry felt off. It takes a while for the two to kiss with real feelings inside the two, and while I love a slow-burn, I am still always about that emotional connection, and Olive and Adam felt like they didn’t have it. I firmly believe part of it has to do with the fake dating itself. Some of their moments felt awkward and even forced that I wondered how the two would develop feelings. They were also in moments where they had been “dating” for a while now, in a way the two would really know what to expect, yet they still fumbled like two teenagers experiencing love for the first time. In a way, they were, but I didn’t like how it played out for a PhD student and professor with a PhD. It just made it too unrealistic. There weren’t enough moments between them that made me root for them as a real couple and hope for the best. I even feel as if they weren't friends just because everything they were doing together was part of their whole “We're dating, so we need people to see us” scheme. Their moments felt completely forced, and not even because they’re fake dating.They just felt boring.While I had no problem with the writing style itself, I expected to be told more about Olive and Adam. I couldn’t understand how or why Adam liked Olive. Other than her being nice and intelligent, there wasn’t anything to appreciate.Olive first had a crush on Adam, but based on her inner monologue, that crush quickly turned into “I love him” mode, which I was unable to understand where it came from. Most of the moments Adam and Olive have are part of their fake dating scheme (they want Anh, other students, and faculty to see them for reasons. Don’t ask). While they talk professionally and personally, it made her crush on Adam realistic and understandable (a crush is easily made, anyway), but the whole love thing felt like it came out of the blue.And the sex scene?We don't talk about it.I wish I could say I laughed at the humor, but I truly didn’t laugh at anything. Well, I did laugh at the stupidity of this book.The side characters also felt too immature for me, especially Anh. She forced Olive to interact with Adam, like the sunscreen situation, the car situation, and the lap situation. Some of the situations (like miscommunication) were ridiculous and could have been solved easily if they literally just talked like the ‘adults’ they were.Overall,The Love Hypothesishad zero appreciation from me. I hoped to see some of the relationship development grow on me, but it just felt tedious. I hardly found myself smiling and laughing (like an idiot), which I usually do with books like these, but this one only felt dull.So if you’re still interested in reading this, please ignore me and my emotionless heart right now and give it a chance. You might end up finding a new favorite if you think about it. If not, then you can join me, and we can question our feelings together.ARC provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Instagram||Threads||Facebook||Amazon||TikTokUpdate: I made a TikTok about this book!https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8F6eLXf/Previous review: Why does that look like Kylo Ren and Rey wearing lab coats thoI have a reputation for being a harsh reviewer, but honestly-- I\'m just immune to hype. If I like a book, I like a book, whether it\'s popular or not. Usually, I find myself not liking hyped books, so I tend to avoid them, but as someone who works in STEM and did lab research, something about the premise of this book was constantly beckoning me. I NEEDED it.Now that I have read the book, I have some thoughts.LIKES✔️ The STEM angle.I did get the impression while reading this that the author was on comfortable and familiar territory. I felt that way about reading LOVE ON THE BRAIN, too. It blends into the narrative in a really nice and satisfying way. You get the, ""Oh yeah, I\'m reading about science! SCIENCE RULES!"" vibe, but it never feels inaccessible. You\'re in on the joke. That\'s not always easy to do with technical writing, so I admired that in this romance.✔️Adam.Look, he might have the personality of a sour glass of milk, but do we stan a gentle giant of a consent king? Yes the fuck we do. I\'m starting to suspect that Ivy League Professor love interests are basically celebrity romances for stuck-up dark academia girlies. The way people swoon in this man\'s presence like they\'re at a Daisy and the Six concert in Daisy and the Six just cracks me up.✔️The food descriptions.I\'m a sucker for a food-friendly romance. And if you\'re going to have a book set in Palo Alto, you gotta dig in (literally! nom nom nom) to the California food scene. Which this book did. To my appreciation.✔️ The weird cheap dates.They\'re students and supposed to be broke. So I don\'t know, I thought it was kind of cute how one of their dates was a stereotypical coffee date and another was a trip to get their flu shots together. I don\'t know, it just felt very college. (Plus, pro-vaccine!)✔️ The sex scenes.Were honestly fine! But BookTok would have you believe that this isFifty Shades of Science, though, and it is not. On the spice scale, this ranks so low that a Midwestern housewife might actually use it to season her mashed potato casserole. This isn\'t even a chili. It\'s black pepper with a kick. Yes, it\'s open door, but it\'s very vanilla and pretty brief.DISLIKES❌️ My sense of disbelief has been thoroughly snapped.The entirety of this book hinges on Olive kissing Adam (not consensually) to trick her friend into thinking she\'s over a guy. Then they fake date to (1) continue this ruse of lying to her friend and (2) trick Adam\'s superiors into thinking that he isn\'t going to move away and get a better job. I haven\'t read this much pathological-lying-for-fun-and-profit since Sophia Kinsella\'sShopaholicseries. Lying is not just a cute little misunderstanding. I know people can be nonconfrontational but this really did feel pathological.❌️The demisexual(?) rep.Olive appears to be coded as demisexual because at one point she tells Adam that she has a low sex drive and can\'t really have sex with people unless she feels an emotional connection. But then, ofc, she becomes a total size queen who\'s horny for Adam... and it starts to feel kind of like she was ""cured"" by sex. I will not understate the value of a sexual relationship that makes you feel emotionally and psychologically ""seen,"" but if Olive was demisexual, I wish she had used the label and there had been more context for her sexuality, and why she feels the way she does.❌️He can fit her whole boob in his mouth.I did not need to know this. But now, alas, I do. Also she\'s the tiniest smol-smol pixie girl to ever stand at a mighty 5\'8"" and there\'s like several mentions of how Adam\'s monstercock and monsterhands are so BIIIIIIIG that he might, idk, snap her like a wishboner. I rolled my eyes over all of this a lot. I know it\'s a kink, but it\'s not mine.❌️There\'s a lot of hate for the sciences in a book that\'s supposed to be empowering to women.I wouldn\'t say this if it weren\'t also present in the other book by the author that I read, but... for a ""STEMinist"" book, it kind of feels like this book hates women in the sciences. Both this book and LotB had conflicts that revolved around the heroine suffering some HUGE (police-involvement-level) harassment campaigns as a result of her gender that interfered with her work. Both this book and LotB feature heroines who seem almost disillusioned with their work and aren\'t really sure they\'re in academia for the right reasons. Both this book and LotB kind of give the impression that it\'s every girl for herself in the science world, which P.S.sucksby the way, so it ends up giving not-like-other-girls.❌️BIG MISUNDERSTANDINGS EVERYWHERE.If you like this trope, you\'ll be happy. But I\'m not a fan of big misunderstandings where both otherwise reasonable characters are deliberately and out-of-characteristically obdurate for the sole purpose of furthering the plot.So overall, this book was fine. I\'m surprised the author gets as much hate as she does for her books because they do what they set out to do. LOVE ON THE BRAIN is definitely a superior work, though, so I\'m actually super curious about her most recent releases because she does seem to be improving with each subsequent book. My advice is to go into these expecting an airport chicklit sort of read, except with a hefty seasoning of some easily digestible science facts.I know I\'m probably forgetting to say more stuff but I think my review more than substantiates the rating.2.5 to 3 stars'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""idk what kind of drugs y’all are on but i evidently did not receive my portionmaybe manvi is right and i just really hate popular booksbut, this was just… not good?the pureagonyof having to read this. yes, i was held at gun point and forced to finish it, do not ask questions, i am not allowed to talk about iti actually picked this to have something fun and easy to read in-between studying but instead i got this infuriating reading experience and a massive spike in my heart rate just from sheer annoyance. you will hear from my cardiologist, believe me, he’s not happy.this was just plain boring. do i care about the couple? no. they could have not ended up together and it would have made no difference to me. why would i root for people who can’t manage to open their goddamn mouth and just talk to each other about their feelings? how does anyone even have relationships? the miscommunication in this was just *chefs kiss* and not in a good way. everyone and their mum knew that adam was in love with olive and yet. yes this man who let’s you coat him in sunscreen and buys you your disgusting pumpkin spice latte (yes, i am with adam on this one. but. hear me out: i’m allergic, so.) and looks at you like the sun shines out of your ass is definitely head over heels for another woman. makes sense.also, the whole spiel about adam being this huge asshole when in reality he a. wasn’t and b. was actually right in that one specific instance and just doing his job of „raising“ good future scientists by giving them pointers how to do good research. and yet i had to sit through that whole drama of „buhu, how dare you date this mean prof, who made me do actual work on my dissertation, i will now hate you, because you are enabling him by dating him“. first of all, have you considered that you’re just doing shit work. second, how the fuck is it olive’s problem. why did i have to read this. it was such an unnecessary conflict.there’s this thing in romance books where they have to hyperfocus on one of the man’s physical attributes and if it’s not the eyes it’s his fucking size. we get it. adam is big.

I just have to give myself a little pep talk. Won\'t take more than a paragraph or two.Okay, Emma. I know you - gag - felt...feelings during this book. I know you were invested in the romance in a way that you have rarely been invested in anything that can remotely be construed as warm and cozy and positive. Your most-watched movie is Spotlight and when you were at home alone for a week you spent it rewatching Mindhunter and You. Your heart is typically shale-esque, in hardness and brittleness and darkness.So I know that you\'re tempted to give five stars for the fact that it cracked your Grinchy shell and made your heart grow three sizes or whatever, but no.This is not a perfect book even though reading it was, like, a near-perfect experience.Even I, who thinks the miscommunication part of any romance is the best part due to the fact that is the most angsty and suffering-based, thought there were about 7 miscommunications too many here.And I could have used a bit more personality from our love interest. Maybe, I don\'t know, actually I take that back because men should leave being fun and characterized to women, who do it better.Okay. End pep talk because it isn\'t working. This is an insanely cute and skipped-heartbeat-inducing book and I want to give it five stars for that alone.Maybe I\'ll come back to it.Bottom line: Yippee!

Be still, my heart!Olive is a third year Ph.D. candidate, filling her pipettes and titrating like a boss, when she somehow manages to land herself in a fake relationship with the ever glowering Dr. Adam Carlsen. She really can't believe her bad luck. Unfortunately, she has spun her lies, so she has no choice but to see them through. But the more time they spend together, the more Olive starts to realize he might just be the one she's been looking for all along.This was just a hoot and a half! A lot of romcoms manage to get the romantic part exactly right, butThe Love Hypothesishits the comedy bit out of the park too. Olive's dialogues are witty and snarky, and she pretty much cracked me up from beginning to end. I couldn't stop giggling and snorting, even while reading in public, which definitely got me some weird looks from strangers.I absolutely loved that Ali Hazelwood chose a woman in STEM as her main character and highlighted the difficulties they encounter as part of this story. As a woman in STEM myself, it warms my heart to see someone like me take center stage in a romance. A lot of what Olive went through, including how intimidating it is to be in a field surrounded by men and how unsure she is of her worth and her ability, I understand intimately.The romance between Olive and Adam developed slowly, with plenty of tension and sizzle. The premise to set up the trope of fake dating was a little silly, but once you get past that, the rest is nothing short of sweet and satisfying. Adam is reticent in the beginning, but he soon thaws and warms up to Olive's relentless cheer and good-natured teasing. His support of her in their shared field is particularly touching and it made me root even harder for this couple.With romances, there's always the question of whether it contains explicit, open-door scenes. And whichever way the book chooses to go, it inevitably alienates half of the readership who wants it the other way. That's why I was particularly fond of the way it was handled in this book. All those scenes are in one contiguous chunk (spread across two chapters), so it's easy to skip if that's not your thing and you can still enjoy the rest of the story without having to worry about missing anything crucial.This story totally checks all the boxes for me. It's sweet, smart, and uproariously funny, and it touched my heart and my mind. No doubt about it, anything Ali Hazelwood writes from now on will be devoured by me posthaste.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:Love on the BrainThe STEMinist NovellasUnder One RoofStuck with You~~~~~~~~~~~~This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

Have you read therightWattpad stories? Some of them are masterpieces and no, I don\'t take criticism. And no, I\'m not talking aboutAftereither 😌The Love Hypothesis will go down as the biggest surprise of this year and no one is more surprise than me. This book has been EVERYWHERE I go. I couldn\'t outrun this book, even if I wanted to. And you know with hype comes great expectations. And with great expectations comes even greater disappointments. Therefore, I made it my mission to go into TLH expecting nothing and received everything.I\'ve read the prologue and I WAS HOOKED!!!When do you ever stumble into a stranger\'s bathroom blinded, because you\'re wearing lenses that has been expired for years and said stranger is going to be your biggest motivator for the years to come?Olive and Adam\'s meet-cute already had me on a chokehold.""It\'s fine."" She waved a hand. She\'d have rolled her eyes, if they hadn\'t been on fire. ""The burning usually lasts only a few minues.""""You mean you\'ve done this before?""She frowned. ""Done what?""""Put in expired contacts.""""Of course. Contacts are not cheap.""""Neither are eyes.""Followed, the story was brimmed with so many rom-com tropes. SO MANY. Maybe Ali Hazelwood tried a little bit too much to bring all of these tropes in one story and maybe it was a bit too much. Personally, I didn\'t mind it, cause every Olive x Adam interaction just made me smile like a fool. But here is a list of all the tropes, you can expect when reading The Love Hypothesis:💫 age gap (Olive, 26 & Adam, 34)💫 sunshine-grumpy💫 fake-dating💫 slow-burn💫 workplace romance💫 Ph.D student x professor (but it\'s not forbidden)💫 mutual pining💫 friends-to-lovers also known as dumbasses-to-lovers💫 one-bed trope (kinda)💫 Hero sees heroine in his clothes and is can\'t talk for a second💫 guy simping for the girl first💫 dimples💫 asshole-ish Hero who is only soft for his girl💫 endless banter and teasing""Come on. Maybe we\'re lucky and the chair will spot us. And I\'ll buy you an ice cream sandwich afterward.""""Will I be paying for this ice-cream sandwich?"" He sounded resigned now.""Likely. Actually, scratch that, you probably don\'t like ice cream anyawy, because you don\'t enjoy anything that\'s good in life."" She kept on walking, pensively chewing on her lower lip. ""Maybe the cafeteria has some raw broccoli?""""I don\'t deserve this verbal abuse on top of the flu shot.I\'ll spare the subpar summary of this book, cause y\'all can read the blurb for yourself and jump right into everything else 😂｡･ﾟﾟ･The Romance･ﾟﾟ･｡Just look at the list above. It literally has all of my favorite tropes in one book. From the first interaction between Adam and Olive I was clued to the pages. I love their easy banter with each other. Olive teasing him about his age. Adam\'s hate about everything sugary (but especially Pumpkin Spice Latte).""Are you going to be less harsh, then?""""Unlikely.""She sighed. ""You know, when I have no more friends and everyone hates me because of this fake-dating thing, I\'ll be super lonely and you are going to have to hang out with me every day. I\'ll annoy you all the time. Is it really worth being mean to every grad in the program?""""Absolutely.""Adam is notoriously known as the campus asshole professor who makes every grad student piss their pants. He\'s super strict when it comes to research and calls his student out on their bullshit when someone is not good enough. But when it comes to Olive, he is a soft harmless kitten. He believes in her so much. Adam always encourages and praises Olive for her brilliant work. Adam Carlsen is Olive\'s #1 fan.""I wish you could see yourself the way I see you.""Women in STEM are underrepresentated and it was refreshing to see Olive being one of the few women working there and making a difference with her research on pancreatic cancer. It was interesting to read Olive\'s frustrating with being a grad student.. all the struggles and insecurites that come with it. All these priviliged white men that think they are some hot shot, but doing the bare minimum work.Olive\'s smart, a great friend, but you know when I fell in love with her? When Olive and Adam went on their first fake coffee date and Adam offered to pay for her coffee, cuz he knows she\'s a poor student and what does that girl do? Adds chocolate chip cookie, a banana and a pack of gum to her coffee 😂😂😂 the audacity lmao yes girl get that luxury package lunch 😂""You\'re so big."" He groaned into her neck. His entire body was vibrating with tension.""You can take it.""The Love Hypothesis was very low on the heat level, but that one sex scene we got. I looooved it 🥵🥵🥵 Every time a Hero has such a big dick that the heroine doesn\'t know if she can take it and he assures her that she can I\'M SCREaMINg 🥵🥵🥵 When Adam tells her that he wants to go down on her until she passes out 🥵🥵🥵🥵 When Adam asked Olive if he can fuck her... I\'m on my knees for my consent king 🛐🥵Adam Carlsen, ik hou van jou 🛐🛐🛐Adam: My arm hurtsOlive: From the flu shot?Adam: It\'s really painful.Olive: Oh, Adam. I\'m so sorry.Olive: Should I come over and kiss it better?Adam: You never said it would hurt so bad.Olive: As someone once told me, it\'s not my job to work on your emotin regulation skills.Adam: 🖕｡･ﾟﾟ･The Friendship between Olive and Anh･ﾟﾟ･｡Anh is Vietnamese and I never see Viet rep in romance book so ofc I\'m going to love this girl.

She was probably my favorite characters from this whole book (no offense to Olive and Adam, cause I love them a lot).My love for her already started that she didn\'t want to date Jeremy, because Olive dated him and gave her approval. This girl knows the girl code too well and it\'s for her that Olive had to come up with this ridicilous idea of kissing the first guy she sees in the hallway to convince Anh that she\'s over Jeremy, so these two can get it on. But then, Anh is also the best wingwoman without knowing. All of her demands for Olive and Adam to show their PDA (Olive using Adam has her chair ✔️ Olive putting sunscreen on a half naked Adam ✔️ Olive kissing Adam ✔️) The list of sexual harassment Adam could compile, I\'d love to see it. 😇｡･ﾟﾟ･The Side-Characters･ﾟﾟ･｡The rest of the secondary characters like Holden and Malcolm were awesome too. I love Adam and Holden\'s friendship. How Holden tries to embarass Adam and Adam pretending to be annoyed and tolerating him even tho their bromance is more than solid. Most of all Holden has Adam\'s back.""I have access to your Google Calender, asshole. You\'re not busy. If you don\'t want to hang out with me, you can just be honest.""""I don\'t want to hang out with you.""""You little shit. After the wee we just had. And on my birthday.""Adam recoiled slightly. ""What? It\'s not your birthday.""""Yes, it is.""""Your birthday is April tenth.""""Is it, though?""Adam closed his eyes, scratching his forehead. ""Holden, we\'ve talked daily for the past twenty-five years, and I have been to at least five Power Rangers-themed birthday parties of yours. The last one was when you turned seventeen. I know when your birthday is.""""You always had it wrong, I was just too nice to tell you.""Malcolm and Olive had a cute friendship too. Loved how Malcolm was so support of Olive\'s feeling for Adam even tho he didn\'t like him. Malcolm with Anh probably the only characters with some brain cells. He gave Olive some good dating advise, but did she listen noooo.｡･ﾟﾟ･A Book not without its faults･ﾟﾟ･｡Like the clown that I am, I really thought this book might be a 5 star read after only reading the prologue lmao that\'s how much I loved Olive and Adam\'s first meeting 😂 But of course I jinxed myself, cause there were a couple of things that I annoyed me.I call this book dumbasses-to-lovers for a reason. Olive and Adam had clearly feelings for each other, but were too chicken shit to confess them. Olive had confessed to Malcolm that she was falling in love w Adam and Adam heard it and when Olive said she was talking about someone else, that dumbass really believed her. I mean it makes for good angst for exacly 3 seconds cause I could feel my boy\'s pain, but how could he not known it was him all along. Same with Olive and her thinking the ""amazing girl"" Adam was pining for all these year was some random women in his faculty like 😭😭😭 guys I thought you were SMART 😭And that ending was so unsatisfying. I hate it when a romance doesn\'t have a proper love confession scene. I know Adam loves Olive and he told it to other, but we never got his ""I love you"" that he said to Olive. There was her confession and then it was cut right to the epilogue that wasn\'t all that satisfying either..｡･ﾟﾟ･Conclusion･ﾟﾟ･｡Should I study for an exam that I have tmrr and instead have read this book? Yes. (1)Will I fail said exam because of this book? Also yes. (2)Will I blame Ali Hazelwood and fictional characters for my inability to manage my life? Y-E-S. (3)Would I do it all over again? See answers (1) to (3)No regrets, I love Olive and Adam so much and The Love Hypothesis will be in my favorite books I\'ve read this year. ♥️P.S. this book taught me to carry myself with the confidence of a medicore white man if I wanna reach my goal and I\'ll always remember that.

If you say another word about the woman I love, if you look at her, if you even think about her, I’m going to fucking kill you”.Este libro es uno de los más bonitos que he leído en mucho tiempo. ¿Saben de esos libros que, cuando los leen, de verdad los hacen volver a creer en el amor? Pues, por muy cursi que suene, eso fueThe Love Hypothesispara mí. Sí, leo un montón de libros de fantasía romántica que tienen unos ideales del amor espectaculares, pero a la vez se sienten tremendamente inalcanzables. PeroThe Love Hypothesises una historia de amor entre dos personas que no son perfectas, que comenten muchísimos errores, que tienen miedo de dejar sus sentimientos al alcance de cualquiera y que, sobre todo, se sienten muy, muy reales.Aquí nos encontramos con Olive, una científica que está intentando encontrar fondos para su investigación sobre un tipo de cáncer y, al mismo tiempo, está tratando de que su mejor amiga se anime a salir con un chico que le encanta, pero que resulta que es su ex. Para impulsarla, Olive decide que su amiga debe verla feliz con un hombre, pero el problema es que su vida amorosa está más desolada que el desierto del Sahara. Sin embargo, un día, en un impulso y aprovechando que su amiga la está viendo, Olive se lanza a besar a uno de los profesores del departamento… que resulta ser nada más y nada menos que Adam Carlsen, a quien básicamente todo el mundo teme porque es frío y despiadado con los estudiantes. La cosa es que, contra todo pronóstico, Olive y Adam terminan entrando en un acuerdo defake dating, cada uno con sus propios motivos, pero todos sabemos cómo acaba esto.Si me conocen, saben que a veces suelo ser supremamente impaciente con los libros que tienen romancesslowburn… yThe Love Hypothesises la definición de eso. Sin embargo, les juro que no había disfrutado tantísimo un libro en mucho tiempo. Toda la historia de Olive y Adam, la tensión que se fue desarrollando con cada encuentro incómodo, con cada situación loca en la que se metían, con cada malentendido, con cada escena en la que se notaba que ambos tenían un poco oxidados sus capacidades de relacionarse con otros seres humanos, con cada pequeña sonrisa que Olive le sacaba a Adam, con los chistes internos que empezaron a aparecer, con las miradas, con la angustia, con el miedo de estar enamorándose del otro y quizás no ser correspondido… wow, todo eso fue como una flecha que se me iba clavando cada vez más hondo en el corazón, que me recordaba eternamente mi desgraciada soltería y que me hacía quererlos a ellos cada vez más. Es absolutamente demente lo mucho que uno puede llegar a involucrarse emocionalmente con dos personas que ni siquiera existen. Pero esa es la magia de los libros, supongo.Y sí, hubo momentos frustrantes en los que quería golpearlos a los dos y encerrarlos en una habitación para que dejaran de pensar cosas idiotas y, por fin, aceptaran que estaban locos el uno por el otro… En serio, hay momentos en los que me sacaban de quicio. Pero al mismo tiempo todo era hermoso y parte de sus procesos. Sobre todo con respecto a Olive. Y me gustaría muchísimo hablar de un aspecto de ella con el que me identifiqué a niveles estratosféricos, pero eso sería unspoiler, así que dejaré que lo descubran ustedes cuando lean el libro.¿Y el final? ¿Qué puedo decirles? Esos últimos capítulos son perfectos, increíbles,spicy, llenos de sentimientos, de más malentendidos, de momentos épicos y, sobre todo, de muchísima, muchísima felicidad. No les puedo decir mucho más, pero sepan queThe Love Hypothesises uno de esos libros que, aunque te pueden frustrar por momentos y que pueden tener escenas tristes, siempre van a quedar como unhighlightde felicidad en tu memoria.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Olive plants a giant kiss on a random person in the hallway. Her friend, Anh, has a crush on a guy that Olive went out with one time, and she wants to convince Anh that she is free to go after her one-date wonder.

Will Olive and Adam be able to convince everyone that they are a couple? Will they discover any real feelings? Plus, Olive is about to graduate....As far as romance novels go, this one was pretty sweet and funny. It was also a quick read. Although I do wish that Adam wasn't always described as essentially an underwear model. Isn't it enough just to be ridiculously smart with a decent job? Do you have to have six-pack abs too? Setting expectations a little high? This might have alienated some readers but if Adam and Olive are both scientists, why don't they have more scientific discussions? I'm not a very scientific person, but I would assume that it would be like two literary buffs quoting book phrases to each other.Overall, this was an enjoyable book with some quality plot development.

Oh, well, I didn\'t enjoy this book whenever I think of it. And it makes me anxious to think that I rated it with 3 stars, lmao... After this, I might be able to rest in peace, knowing that I rated as I thought when I first finished it. Straight to ""big hype, big lie"" shelf. :D“He’d clearly never seen a rom-com or read a romance novel in his life.”Buckle up, bitches, there are some spoilers ahead!I honestly haven\'t read a lot books with ""miss sunshine and mister grumpy"" trope, but I kind of know how the thing goes, so yikes.For what I know, this book was a Reylo fanfic, so picturing Adam as Adam Driver wasn\'t complicated. But it made it hard for me because. . . Idk, it\'s not that I think he\'s ugly, but I don\'t think either that he\'s sexy. If you find him attractive and that stuff, then you know your reasons.I\'ve seen a LOT —y\'all know that I don\'t lie with this— of hype for this book. *looks at booktok, booktwt, bookstagram* So, I had to give it a try. . . Every single day appears on my feed at least 6 times in a row friends\' updates of this book, so, I thought ""this book must be good"".Anyhow, I don\'t actually know how to feel about this book. . . It was. . . weird? Sweet? Awkward? Immature?Idk, you name it.I\'m fan of nerd and smart people who\'re not smug, arrogant and assholes. Actually, there\'s more probability that I fall in love with some nerd (I\'m not straight, so, lol) like Adam or Olive than for someone like Tom (he was hot, but he was such a fucking dick).I hadZEROexpectations from this book because lately ""great"" and overhyped books tend to disappoint me to the point of not wanting to have high hopes (don\'t start with the ""then why do you read them?"" because I\'m not a nice person when it comes to insult people, lmao) aND YET, HERE I AM, WRITING THE REVIEW OF THIS BOOK.I need to check up on my life choices. . . Which makes me go to the thing that drove me mad in this book: eVERY SINGLE FUCKING TIME OLIVE WAS LIKE ""YES, THIS IS MY LIFE BECAUSE OF MY DECISIONS"", YES, SIS, WE GET IT. YOU\'VE MADE SOME SILLY AND POOR DECISIONS, BUT BUCKLE UP, AND MOVE THE FUCK ON.Also, I was so fucking tired of the“carry yourself with the confidence of a mediocre white man”Yes, we get it, white men are mediocre. Most of them are. I just don\'t know why, but that phrase pissed me off.Chapter 16 was so hyped. Bitch, no. It was awkward and it seemed very very very forced. It is mentioned (briefly, but there it is) that Olive might be asexual, which is fine and I don\'t judge that because I am ace and I totally get how it feels. Nevertheless, I did think that was forced:Iperceived her uncomfortable doing that, despite the fact that she agreed. I honestly don\'t know how sex works, lol. Totally unnecessary. I get the hype for some things, but not for chapter 16. It wasn\'t spicy in any single way. It made me feel uncomfortable and I was cringing every 10 seconds. I thought that something good was gonna happen, and I was left with empty hands because I received nothing from that chapter.Idk why, but Olive seemed VERY immature and Adam was flat? Yes, Mr. Grumpy and-I-hate-everything-black-is-my-color-because-black-is-my-soul-and-I-make-my-grades-cry. I get the trope, I really do, but give him some personality???Adam it\'s perceived as someone complicated and who loves their own personal space (again, I don\'t judge because I enjoy my own personal space as no one) and Olive describes him as ""antagonic and unapproachable"" aLL THE TIME. If people told me that, I\'d take it as a joke, but deep down that shit hurts, even as a joke or random comment, but, yeah, us, grumpy people, are like that. I get that Adam is huge, that have big ass hands, big body, big shoulders and big dick. wE GET IT. Just please stop repeating it every damn time the damn man appears.Sometimes, I disliked Anh. I didn\'t know if she was around 26 or 15. She basically forced Olive to do things that obviously she didn\'t wanna do, despite the fact that Anh thought that Olive and Adam were dating and she didn\'t know the whole truth. She was very flat and at the very end we didn\'t have a lot of her.After the big disappointing that chapter 16 turned out to be, I was even more disappointed than ever. I mean, as I said: I had very little —if none at this point— expectations, but chapter 16 made it go from 0.01 to -00000000000000000000 in a span of 5 minutes, and I didn\'t wanna read anymore.When Adam said, and I quote:""If you say another word about the woman I love...""I lost my shit. I was fucking melting and no, I am not ashamed of it, lol.The romance was okay I guess??? I don\'t know why, but I expected more. Please don\'t ask me why, because even I don\'t know the answer to that... Perhaps it was all of the hype on booktok and bookstagram, but it was a flop to me, lmao.Overall I guess it was fine? Idk dude, writing this review made me realize that I didn\'t like this book as much as I wanted.Tho I\'d fake-date / fake-marry someone to get out of Latin America (third world country issues, lol) and get the citizenship in another country, perhaps Europe or Canada? Idk, love can come with time, lol.Tom was an asshole and I wish Adam would have punch him in the face :)In overall, as I didn\'t enjoy a lot of romance (or think that actually was romantic, cute and that stuff) makes me think that I\'m a heartless and cold bitch who can\'t feel a single thing or will never fall in love. bUT I\'M ALSO A HOPELESS ROMANTIC.

I actually cannot believe this is a debut novel. Ali Hazelwood writes like a seasoned author and I seriously loved this one.

But to appease her best friend, she needs it to appear she is. The most unlikely fake-boyfriend she can think of is who she ends up kissing. The young professor with the reputation of being a hardass, Adam Carlsen.This was seriously one of the most fun fake-dating books I\'ve read in a while and I loved the spin this author put on it. Olive cracked me up with all of her fake dating knowledge, the \'one bed\' line was one of my favorites of the book.""You could room with me.”“I couldn’t.”“The room is a double, of course,” he offered, as if that piece of information could have possibly changed her mind.“It’s not a good idea.”“Why?”“Adam.” She rubbed her forehead with her fingers. “There will be only one bed.”He frowned. “No, as I said it’s a double—”“It’s not. It won’t be. There will be only one bed, for sure.”He gave her a puzzled look. “I got the booking confirmation the other day. I can forward it to you if you want, it says that—”“It doesn’t matter what it says. It’s always one bed.”He stared at her, perplexed, and she sighed and leaned helplessly against the back of her chair. He’d clearly never seen a rom-com or read a romance novel in his life.The banter, the humor, the romance, this one just had everything I loved all tied up in a fantastic slow burn romance. Adam was exactly the kind of grumpy hero I love and Olive was a wonderful heroine.

Because Jack Smith, the annoyingly attractive and broody older brother of her favorite client, turns out to be the cold-hearted experimental physicist who ruined her mentor’s career and undermined the reputation of theorists everywhere. And that same Jack who now sits on the hiring committee at MIT, right between Elsie and her dream job.Elsie is prepared for an all-out war of scholarly sabotage but…those long, penetrating looks?

I have noticed ali includes this in almost all of her novels. It was included inThe Love Hypothesisand god forbid we mention that sex scene inUnder One Roofit still remains with me no matter how much i try to purge it from my brain. And now im this book, now i am no expert when it comes to aroace rep but i feel like she always goes with the: ‘ive never wanted to have sex i dont know whats wrong with me’ line and that is so wrong.Now, there is one word that i cannot get behind and that is the use of the word “Daddy” I hate it so much. And i sould not be reading the word ‘daddy’ in a science romance book! It is simply unnacpetable and Iwill notstand for it. It was used inLove on the Brainand now this book. It will stop with this book. You hear me Ali Hazelwood?From me to you, we can both agree that miscommunication and down to earthstupidityis something we both wholeheartedly hate right? Yes well, funny you should agree because in this book and inLove on the Brainthe male love interest very patently tells them: “I DO NOT hate you I AM NOT WHO I WAS ALL THOSE YEARS AGO” somehow the amazingly smart and illtellegent women in stem still think these men hate them after literallythree whole freeking pagesof him telling her he doesnt and how he felt the entire trajectory of their relationship (from meeting to current) and i swear to you all the girls brain power must be directed towards academic because the havenone, nada, ZEROemotional intellegence EVEN AFTER BEING TOLD STRAIGHT TO THERE FACEWoah, this really rubbed me the wrong way, because it happened in TWO BOOKS and the guy is always so patient and nice. If i was in the situation god knows what I would do. Screw their heads on straight probably. They definatly need it.We all know that Ali Hazelwoodlovesto tell us every.single.page that the love interest is big and tall and ginormous and takes up all space. Granted she still did it here but toned it downa lotmy personal favourites were:“like how could i miss him when hes standing next to Adam Carlson. Theyre the Mount Rushmore of STEM academia”“He is……well, he is big. And well muscled, very well muscled”And saving the best for last:“His giant paws tightened around me”Think about that for a while won’t you?Lets talk about what I liked hmn? Why don’t you refil your popcorn and water you’ll be needing it.So, the thing I loved the most is that I had fun. I had so much fun reading the physics jokes and the story as a whole. The writing was so much better than her previous books. Praise the lord that they both had a personality and we got to know stuff about them (i didnt even know Adam was an evolutionary biologist until this book(how freaking cool is that as a job? OgkjdfjefbdhbdhjskI would kill to talk to someone with his knowlege and intelligence) like that\'s how little we got told about Adam) but in this book we got Jack\'s job upbringing and morals. It was good to have a more layered story than usual and still have fun. Usually Ali throws tropes into a mixing bowl and hopes for a delicious cake but thankfully it was a flowy story and that was not the case. InThe Love Hypothesisthere was trope after trope, as if to make readers happy and it did but gosh there was a lot jam packed in there.George was my favouite character of this entire book. She\'s my idol in life. She has many publications in physics, is super cool and has a wife that can make souvlaki. Now if you cant tell i really live Dora and George and i need their story now. I am deeply in love with both of them.I loved Elsies character development from extreme people pleaser(coming from a people pleaser) to her own person. It was so fun to see, especially with Jack helping her and calling her bullshit out.My most favourite thing of all was ofc the cameo from Adam and Olive and the friend group with all the cool science people.thatin my opinion was the best part of the bookand that\'s why we need a george and Dora book so we can have more of thatNow that all the boring stuff is out of the way let\'s get into what I didnt like because this is the real juicy stuffIhatedthe main characters actual name: Jonathan, but only because thats name of a close relative of mine and it\'s weird to read a romance with their name in itAnd that name? Jack Smith? I still stand by my clain that that sounds like the most old white man that throws money at stuff to make it go away guy. Honestly add some spice, some paprika, lemon peper, cinnamon to make it taste better on the tongue.I got the scene, that as a millennial Ali was trying to be ‘hip’ and be ‘down wid it’ as the first few chapters really showed meIn the very first chapter we got told her favourite movie was Twilight (pop culture reference is not good, we dont like that) and honestly her professor should have failed him because she liked twilight. I strongly dislike that movie and so personally i agree with the proffesor. there i said it. and yk what idc if its wrong.I think Ali is trying to live through her characters, I can see her personality come through her books and not in a good way. She includes ‘quirks’ because women in stem have to be unique and quirky. (as a woman in stem i can tell you i\'m not. I read, study, and listen to Taylor Swift. So not very quirky at all) There was a quote she put in that made me feel like Ali was justifying her opinions:”Not that there would be anything wrong: sex work is legitamite work, and people that engage in it are just as deserving of respect as ballerinas, or firefighters or hedge fund managers”I mean she\'s not wrong, but we didnt need to include it in a romance novel did we? So that\'s now my biggest problem, that she includes her own shit into romance novels. but i guess thats how i perceve it. Like social issues in books i dislike because i want a whole different world without all the shit that happens in this book.NB: Riddle me this: miss people pleaser can\'t tell her best friend her favourite movie was twilight but can tell her client???Okayyyy, I think I\'m done, now get up and stretch your legs, it\'s been a long read. Go to the wharepaku (toilet) and i will leave you with this:we need lesbian women in stem romance book, george and Dora are right there Ali, USE THEM.....{About this review below, yes it was insensitive for me to write a review before I read a book, but it was my opinion from reading the blurb so I am not sorry I did it}{this review is based off the synopsis i have not been given an arc}I asked and Miss Hazelwood did not deliver.This book looks like an exact carbon copy of Love on the Brain and The Love Hypothesis mashed together""Rival physicistscollide in a vortex ofacademic feuds and fake dating shenanigansin this delightfully STEMinist romcom""Sound familiar??In The Love Hypothesis Adam and Olive fake datedIn Love on the Brain Levi and Bee were rivals in collage""By day, she’s an adjunct professor, toiling away at grading labs and teaching thermodynamics in the hopes of landing tenure. By other day, Elsie makes up for her non-existent paycheck by offering her services as a fake girlfriend""Again InLove on the BrainBee was a scientist by day and a social media STEM infulence by night. Seems like all her characters have two \'personas\'Jack Smith,the annoyingly attractive and broodyolder brother of her favorite client, turns out to be thecold-hearted experimental physicist who ruined her mentor’s career and undermined the reputation of theorists everywhereagain, sounds familiar??In The Love Hypothesis Adam was known for turning people thesis down because \'they wernt good enough\' he was known as cold hearted and scary.In Love on the Brain, Bee thought Levi ruined her career.Also what kind of simple ass name is Jack Smith, please choose something more interesting for flavour.Elsie is prepared for an all-out war of scholarly sabotage but…those long, penetrating looks? Not having to be anything other than her true self when she’s with him? Will falling into an experimentalist’s orbit finally tempt her to put her most guarded theories on love into practice?I bet you that this book will be that the girl finds out how soft and sweet he is under that scary persona and he\'ll only be nice to herEven the covers look the sameI rest my casethank you for coming to my TED talkp.s i will still be reading this because well women in stem what am i to do? already not enough around so despite my hypothesis (get ittt) i will still be reading and lets hope that I am dead wrong.........................this looks like every other Ali Hazelwood book ESPECIALLY THE LOVE HYPOTHESIS IT LOOKS THE EXACT SAMEBut at least he doesn’t have black hair right? Let’s take what we can get…………………AliPlease don’t become a one hit wonder. Do something different.Love Zoe'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'The queen of STEM romance, the creator of the quirkiest, nerdiest, most entertaining, likable, and huggable characters is back! And she\'s returned with my all-time favorite trope: enemies to lovers!I can honestly say this is my favorite book of hers because it\'s funnier, sexier, and quirkier! Did I mention that Jack Smith is the best book boyfriend she\'s ever created? That sulking, intense, intelligent man knows how to make a girl happy! He\'s passionate, but he perfectly controls himself to put Elsie\'s needs first. He\'s caring, patient, and gentle. I loved him!Let me introduce you to dear Elsie, who deserves ten thousand hugs. She has a Ph.D. in theoretical physics. When she couldn\'t get an academic position, she resorted to fake-dating to pay off her student loans. Even though she still lives in a crappy apartment with her bestie Cece, she remains hopeful that she\'ll find a better position in the near future. She still manages to keep her head above water as an adjunct professor, teaching five different classes, grading labs, and reading her students\' very sincere emails (those emails made my week! I laughed too hard!). Meanwhile, her mother forces her to become a negotiator to solve her big brothers\' extra immature problems they\'ve gotten themselves into!Elsie\'s weakness is that she doesn\'t know the meaning of ""no""! She can never say the word! She molds herself into a different character for each person in her life, putting their needs first. That\'s why she never thinks about what she really wants from the universe!Then, her path crosses with her nemesis. She finds out that Jack Smith, the brooding but charismatic brother of her best fake-dating customer Greg, is the same person who wrote an article that ruined her mentor\'s career! Unfortunately, he\'s also the man who\'s in charge of the physics department at MIT and one of the decision-makers who will decide if she\'s the right candidate for her dream job. Jack supports another candidate for the job and is shocked to find out that Elsie is not the librarian girlfriend of her brother, as he was led to believe. As an experimental theorist, he has every intention of rejecting to work with a theorist!Elsie has no intention of giving up her dream job without a fight. She\'s determined to fight against the man who gets under her skin. Yes, she finds him very attractive. Yes, she wants to rip his clothes off and kiss him senseless, then punch him in the face. But she can restrain her feelings to be professional, right? Oh, you already know the answer!Overall, Elsie and Jack were dynamite! I loved their dialogues, hilarious banters, and blazing chemistry! This is my favorite work of the author! I wish I could give it more than five stars!Special thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing this amazing digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest opinions.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology:medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '""You could be my entire world. If you let me.""""I think I will.""So conflicted thoughts.. It\'s not a bad rating, I did enjoy it but there were things which could have been better.✔️ Enemies to lovers✔️ STEM romance✔️ She is dating his brother (in a way)✔��� Witty banter✔️ Slow burn✔️ Twilight references (lots of them)✔️ Adam and Olive cameoFirstly, let me start by saying this one wasso much better than Love on the Brain.I hated that one so much.*sigh*Or maybe it\'s the fact that it\'s been long since I read The Love Hypothesis that this was enjoyable. Although,there are few similarities to TLH but it\'s not overbearing.Like Adam and Olive, and unlike Bee and Levi Elsie and Jack are unique and true to themselves. But if you are looking for them to recreate the same magic as in TLH, you will be disappointed. Cause the two here, are quite forgettable and bland.Elsie,is not a bad FMC, she is quite relatable in some places and such a pushover in others that it gets a bit frustrating. However she stays true to her personality- being a people pleaser. I did like how she was able to be her true self around Jack.Jackis not like Adam and that\'s simply put. Don\'t get me wrong, he is nice, kind and respectful but he is also boring. I like that he\'s paying attention to details, calling Elsie out on her bs, and always so open to her but there\'s no firepower in him. He\'s just there.""I have these elaborate daydreams that Im feeding you a five course meal I hunted, field dressed and prepare all by myself.""Coming to theromance,it was okay-ish. I enjoyed some of their moments together. I LOVED the Twilight references. I enjoyed the first half when Jack was trying to figure Elsie out, especially when she was involved with Greg. But the two had very little heat. It was not angsty.The slow burn was too slow. The spice was not spice, it was just salt and pepper.The fact that the two kept talking and talking and talking and talking and talking while trying to figure out where to put his fingers and dick in..it was too late. Look, I appreciate he wants to be sure she wants it but how many times does she have to repeat herself 😭😭 Also the fact she kept pushing him for sex after knowing how clear he made it that he wants things slow- 🚩🚩 In my opinion,I would prefer that Ali Hazelwood writes a clean romance rather than whatever tf she thinks is smut.I really loved the Adam and Olive cameo, even for a short while they radiated power, chemistry and all things good.

No one can possibly be this much of a doormat, can they?Elsie is slaving away as an adjunct professor teaching too many classes to make ends meet. She supplements her meager earnings by being a fake girlfriend, putting her people-pleasing tendencies to good use. When a chance at her dream job arises, the only thing standing in her way is Jack, the annoying older brother of someone she\'s fake-dating, who also happens to be on her interview committee. But do they really hate each other or is it more like they secretly have the hots for each other? Ha!I really enjoyed the first half of this story. It starts strong with all of the hallmarks I love from Ali Hazelwood—snark, banter, science, smart female in STEM, and puns. I was breezing through it, smiling and chuckling to myself on pretty much every sentence. No one does funny situations and dialogues quite like Hazelwood, and she had me in stitches.I\'ll grant you that the premise is a bit out there. What are the odds that the guy Elsie is hating/lusting after, is also the brother of a guy she\'s fake-dating, while also being the only person who almost beat her at Go, while also being the guy who irreparably damaged her field of study back in the day, while also being the head of the physics department at MIT where she is interviewing? I\'ll tell you what, it\'s 100% according to this book.But as the story went on, Elsie started to annoy me. First, she refuses to believe that Jack is attracted to her even though he tells her so on multiple occasions. At one point, she even interprets him saying ""Can I take you out?"" as he wants to murder her mob-style. Like what?Elsie also takes people-pleasing to heretofore-unseen heights. She lies to her roommate about pretty much every preference she has. She runs interference for her brothers at her mom\'s behest even though she doesn\'t want to. And she must get her mentor\'s approval before accepting a job offer that would give her several times her current salary and health insurance. Have mercy! My eyeballs were bruised from all the rolling.It\'s no secret that I prefer my female characters to be strong and smart, ready to kick ass and save the world. Elsie is strong in her work, but the opposite in every other way. And slowly, over many demure ""You can\'t possibly like me,"" it started to grate on my nerves. Not even Hazelwood\'s many comedic reliefs can save it from such never-ending waffling and meekness.This may just have been a case where I wasn\'t a good fit for the book. Without being able to connect with Elsie, I never really invested in the story. Not to mention I couldn\'t feel any chemistry between Jack and Elsie, and it all made for a rather lackluster read by the end.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:The Love HypothesisLove on the BrainThe STEMinist NovellasUnder One RoofStuck with You~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

Better than theLove Hypothesis(4-stars) andLove on the Brain(3-stars)! Honestly, my favorite contemporary romance of the year! 🤩Ali Hazelwood is the QUEEN OF STEM ROMANCE!Seriously, I could give two flying f*cks about STEM, yet somehow Ali is able to center an entire story around it while making it interesting and explaining it in a way that allows me to understand. But what always stands out is the way Ali portrays the struggles women in STEM have to go through. From blatant sexism to sexual harassment to manipulation, the challenges are appalling and endless. I specifically liked how she dives into the \'type\' of acceptable women in STEM:""The you people want is sharp, impeccable, perfect enough to justify your intrusion in a field that for centuries has been \'rightfully\' male. But not too perfect, because apparently only \'stone-cold bitches\' are like that, and they do not make for congenial, affable colleagues.""For fuck\'s sake, that\'s insane, but the absolute truth. It\'s infuriating to see the amount of pandering women in STEM have to do to the men in their field so that they are accepted. Once again, thank you, Ali Hazelwood, for bringing awareness to such an important topic.I really connected to Elsie on a personal level.Elsie has been a people pleaser her entire life, to the point that she masquerades many different faces around different people in order to fit their expectations or make them love and accept her. This begs the question of who is the real Elsie Hannaway? Unfortunately, Elsie doesn\'t really know since she\'s been living her life for others and ignores what she truly wants and needs. I know some people might think that the extent to which she people pleases is dramatic, but I can with 100% certainty say, I\'ve been her. Yes, I\'ve put on facades to make people feel more at ease. I\'ve lied about my likes and interests to fit in with people. I\'ve tampered down my own personality so people will find me more acceptable. I\'ve done things I didn\'t want to do because it\'s what was expected of me. And this didn\'t just happen with strangers. It also happened around friends and family. And let me tell you, it was exhausting and terrifying not being able to just be who you are - living in constant fear that someone will dislike you or find you weird or think you\'re beneath them. Luckily, I went to therapy and have worked on breaking out of the people-pleasing cycle. And I\'m so glad Elsie also starts therapy at the end. I really think Ali Hazelwood did a fantastic job portraying what it\'s like being a people-pleaser and how much it can emotionally and psychologically impact you.The friendship between Cece and Elsie was everything.I really adore Cece\'s humor and how incredibly loyal, supportive, and loving she is to Elise. And even after finding out Elsie hasn\'t been completely open and honest with her, Cece\'s first instinct is to say,""I will love you forever.""My heart nearly burst wide open because that is true love.Jack. The love of my life. One of my favorite MMC of all time!Where do I even begin with this man? He\'s perceptive, confident, honest, charming, thoughtful, intelligent, kind, handsome, sexy, and pretty much the most perfect man to ever be written! I love him (in case you can\'t tell lol). Not only does he fall first, but he is a huge freaking simp for Elsie and just wants to take care of her. Seriously, this guy is a dream. 😍 But what I love even more is that Jack is a supportive KING! Jack encourages Elsie to just be herself, and while she struggles to learn exactly whose that is, he is there with constant love and support, and lets her discover these things in her own time.The romance is perfection!We start with so much tension, misconceptions, and hate (on Elsie\'s side), and then it explodes into this profoundly wonderful and deeply emotional love. There\'s so much chemistry, respect, love, and care between these two that it makes my heart soar.The spice was a RIDE!Our girl Elsie has never really enjoyed sex or felt much sexual attraction towards anyone . . . before Jack. And while Elsie wants to just jump his bones, Jack takes his time and focuses first and foremost on her pleasure and her pleasure alone, all so she can discover what she likes. And DAMN it is HOT. 🥵 This is the spiciest Ali Hazelwood book yet, and I ATE THAT SHIT UP!""I think I want to do this every day,"" he responds, kissing my pussy like he would my mouth. ""Every day for the rest of my life.""I also love that Jack sets some boundaries sexually because he wants to make sure this is truly something Elsie wants, and not just something she thinks she has to do for him to like her (which we learn is something she did with a previous partner).Overall, Love, Theoretically is a witty, charming, and sexy story with lots of depth that will make you laugh and tug at your heart.Ali Hazelwood\'s writing is a dream, the pacing is fantastic, and the characters are so amazing that you can\'t help but fall in love with them. I could go on and on about all the things I love about this book, but this would turn into a full-blown essay, so I\'ll stop here. But the bottom line is this is one of the best contemporary romance books I\'ve ever read. I 100% recommend reading it and hope you love it as much as I do!Thank you to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing Group for providing an eARC in exchange for an honest review!

If you let me""Yep, that\'s right. AND, I am just going to say it..... this book is BETTER than The Love Hypothesis, I said what I said.Elsie is an adjunct professor struggling to make ends meet financially while also not doing the work that she really feels passionate about when the opportunity of a lifetime, to teach/research at MIT, presents itself. She just has to nail her interview and all her dreams will come true. But there is just one problem. Jack Smith. Her professional nemesis, a man that she hates like it\'s her religion, and is also one of the deciding votes on whether or not she gets the job. Oh, and he also is the brother of the man she is fake dating. Whoops.Aahh! I LOVED this book so much. I am as shocked as anyone, bc its easily my favorite contemporary romance of the year so far. I was really weary going in bc of so many mixed reviews, but honestly this book just resonated with me. The romance is fantastic, I am a sucker for academic rivals and this one is done PERFECTLY! The tension is soooo good! It was objectively hilarious, the banter was top tier, the cast of supporting characters were absolutely delightful from her quirky best friend Cece to the puny professor Volkov and Jacks sweet brother and taciturn grandmother, they all served to move the story in someway and were fun and interesting. AND CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE ADAM AND OLIVE CAMEO?!!!! 😍😍 SO CUTE!!!!! Also, this is her best writing by far, the pacing is perfect, the story flows, it was funny and smart and well developed from start to finish.Elsie-I really, really love Elsie and I know that at times she isn\'t exactly easy to love bc she masks so much but I really appreciated her struggles with her identity. She has formed this survival instinct born from childhood emotional neglect and then later just being a woman trying to get by in a field that is largely a boys club and she loses herself and ultimately this pseudo persona overwhelms her whole life . I really liked seeing a woman become self aware and take steps to change that and that it was hard and not immediate. So often I see people say, well she should know better or she is too smart to be so oblivious, and sometimes that\'s true. But sometimes it\'s not, and there is a process of change that has to happen and those paths are never neat or pretty and I really appreciated that progression in her character arc. And also, a high IQ doesn\'t always equal a high EQ, being smart doesn\'t exempt you from having deep emotional issues and doesn\'t make you any less smart, it just makes you human.Jack-Ahh this man is so whipped for Elsie and I LOVED it! And can we just talk about how good dirty he is?! I already have a thing for the surly Professor type and this is another one that goes on the roster of top hot teachers bc damn! The fireworks and the chemistry between Jack and Elsie were AMAZING! I ate it up and also I thought the sex scenes were super hot and I also appreciated that they were realistic. I kind of liked that they were trial and error bc not everyone is some sexpert like you read in so many novels. But besides that, I love how he respects Elsie and her talent. He is attentive to everything about her and sees the real her and forces her to be herself and drop the pretense but he does it in a way that is so non judgmental and supportive of what Elsie wants for herself and not everyone else including him. I love that he isn\'t perfect either and also struggling with his own issues.Random things I loved-CeCe, Elsie\'s best friend is so funny and weird and she made me laugh the entire book.-George was so sweet!-The grandmother, you gotta love an old lady that gives zero fucks and tells it like it is.-The Twilight references 🤌-The Hoth reference!!-Olive and Adam 😭😭'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""Oh, wow. I made it. Yay me!First of all, I would like to congratulate the author for selling the same story for the sixth time. That's some serious business talent.Here is my list:Female MC is small to medium ✅Male MC is unconventionaly huge, tall, a mountain, a refrigerator, an oak, fills the doorframe ✅He falls for her first ✅She is extremely clueless he likes her even after he tells it to her face and shows it to her in 9272525 romantic and cheesy ways ✅They are scientists on opposite sides and she “hates” him ✅She has extremely low self esteem ✅She has extremely low emotional intelligence but she is a scientific genius ✅There is a villain scientist just for the twist ✅She wants a better job because she's poor AF because she's a female scientist ✅She thinks his friend is his girlfriend which causes unnecessary misunderstanding ✅Did I mention how big and chiseled he is? Like big, huge, enormous, gigantic, everyone around him looks like a child because he is so big big tall tall huge huge and it’s mentioned in every possible moment ✅So, if you've read any of the previous books by this author, you can go through my list and see how many ✅ you'll have. Yeh. All of them. I've read 6 of her books and yeah. They are all the same story. The only difference is the names of the characters and the science field they work (and rival) in. This book is the worst. The female MC is the dumbest character I've ever read. Seriously. If you want an example, here it is. She wakes up next to him after just sleeping. She feels his big, huge, enormous... You know. And she thinks he has to PEE. To pee. I shit you not. A phd physicist thinks men have er3cti0n when they have to pee.Example no2. He tells her for at least 3 times he likes her. He invites her to have dinner with him after being a perfect gentleman and having her slept at his place. And she asks: You mean, you want to kill me? Yes, honey, after having you alone in his home for the whole night, he is going to take you to a public restaurant to kill you.There are more of these dumb scenes, but I don't want to waste any more time on this book. This is the worst book I've read in a long time and by far the most irritating female MC ever. I don't think I'll ever pick up a book by this author again.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'I hate to say it but I didn’t love this book…It’s not that I hated it, but maybe even I got tired of the repetitiveness. I mean to be fair I did expect a big guy to fall (first) for a small girl and fuck her without a condom. It’s just that unfortunately this time the big guy was a little bland and I didn’t fall for him and the small girl was dumb af, especially for a brilliant scientist.Maybe Twilight fans will appreciate the Twilight references and the fact that Elsie reads people (almost like Edward) but Jack is the only person she can’t read (almost like Bella), but I’m not a Twilight fan.On top of that Elsie’s entire career can be a trigger and don’t even get me started on Jack’s childhood. However that’s probably a me problem.I didn’t even like the spice 🫣 she tried to kiss him and his reaction was the weirdest thing ever 😳However I have to admit it was low on miscommunication compared to the previous books so there’s progress!My favorite part was meeting Adam and Olive 🥹——-Okay, I didn’t get the arc, so you have to clean up the shit yourself, girl.

For a year.Sincerely,Dab'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'HEAVEN FOR NERDS, that\'s what this book is (I\'m nerds)OVERALL THOUGHTS: This book was just WHAT I needed, WHEN I needed it! I\'ve only read The Love Hypothesis by this author before and it was highly enjoyable (I rated it 4 stars). BUT THIS ONE WAS AMAZING. To be honest, this is not my original opinion, but I\'ve seen people say this is Hazelwood\'s best work so far. I\'m not exactly qualified to speak on this, BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT I LOVED THIS BOOK. Yes the romance was very typically Ali Hazelwood, highly unrealistic and bubbly, but you simply cannot hate it. However, there were certain parts of this story that really sticked out to me and for that reason I\'ll list them here:1. THE PLOT - I would suggest going into this book without reading the blurb. I haven\'t read it before reading the actual book and that\'s why this was like an Easter egg to me. Important plot points were revealed early in the book, BUT THOSE REVELATION SCENES were so good, my Kindle flew across the room. This is another Ali Hazelwood ""Women in STEM find unrealistically good gigantic men"" novel and that\'s all you need to know. And yeah, they\'re physicists in this one!2. THEORISTS VS EXPERIMENTALISTS - Listen, I don\'t care for physics, I had an A back in high school but I always hated the subject (sorry not sorry). Which means, theories and experiments on crystals, research papers on quantum mechanics and what not don\'t mean much to me, but in this little novel (not really little, this was THICK) YOU CAN\'T POSSIBLY IMAGINE HOW MUCH BANTER WE GOT from their scientific disagreements. Sign me up, nerds are hot! But also like, we didn\'t get TMI on those topics, so I didn\'t feel suffocated.3. THE JOKES - This book had me LAUGHING on so many occasions. And I\'m not big on laughing while reading, especially LAUGHING OUT LOUD! But hey, I was gasping at some of these. And unfortunately, most of those dad jokes that one professor (can\'t be bothered to check his name again) threw around had me hollering. ALSO, student mail that Elsie received was peak humour.4. POP CULTURE REFERENCES - As much as I can remember, Ali Hazelwood is big on these. Here, it was like every other sentence. But my silly little gemini brain feeds off of them! Barbie was mentioned, Chris Nolan (TWICE), A PERFECT CURE FOR MY POST-BARBENHEIMER DEPRESSION (I don\'t know if that\'s a thing, pls tell me is anyone has it). Like I said, I got this book WHEN I needed it and it was WHAT I needed.5. ACADEMIA REALNESS - this aspect is something I admire Ali Hazelwood for. And said aspect was more prominent in this book than in The Love Hypothesis. Even though these books are unrealistic (I\'m tired of myself saying that), they still deliver some very real situations that happen in STEM surroundings almost every day. I\'m a med student myself and I\'ve spent 4 years already in this atmosphere, so certain struggles (money, women in science, stealing work, struggling to achieve your goals, abandoning your interests for your scientific dream) Elsie has (had) I really can identify with. Hazelwood gives you this very cruel manly toxic world and offers you a perfect fairytale escape, MOTHER ENERGY!🧎🏼\u200d♀️6. MEDICAL CONDITION REP - Our female protagonist in this novel has diabetes type 1, while she doesn\'t have health insurance and has to finance each and every insulin bolus herself. I\'m not making it to be this big Nobel-prize-for-peace thing, but it was nice to see this very common but life-threatening condition represented in popular fiction!CHARACTERS I usually describe main characters separately but I won\'t be doing that here. I loved Elsie and Jack equally. Their chemistry was really well-written. Many aspects of their personalities are sort of spoilers so I also won\'t be sharing those. Other aspects were written above. One thing tho, Jack\'s physical description reminds me of Dominic Sherwood (used to act in the terrible Shadowhunters show). Did anyone else get that reference (was he by any chance based on Dom or am I making that up)? Pls tell me in the comments. 🧐NOTE: This book was much spicier that The Love Hypothesis so do with that info what you want! 🤭I CAN\'T WAIT TO READ MORE ALI HAZELWOOD!💕💕'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Oh my GOD this book. Where do I even start? First of all, 5 stars. Easy. EASY 5 stars. There’s just something about the stories Ali Hazelwood crafts and the personalities she writes that hit with me. I loved The Love Hypothesis beyond words and was a bit iffy on Love on the Brain, so I wasn’t quite sure how this one was going to go, but oh my god she delivered again.@baskinsuns on tiktok has a really great video on this topic, but the way that Ali Hazelwood writes these male love interests who have such a deep and gentlelikeof the heroine is so…ooh she’s ruining my life. Yes it’s a romance novel so obviously they fall in love, but Jack Smith genuinely likes and enjoys Elsie as a person outside of his romantic love for her. He respects her, he admires her, he wants to hear her talk about the things she enjoys and he wants to experience them with her simply because it makes her happy. There’s a softness to the way Ali Hazelwood’s men care for their partners that just hits different.And the academic rivals in this book? Top fucking tier. From the very get go. It’s delicious. Delectable. I’m eating it up on every goddamn page. The dynamic it engenders between Elsie - the consummate People Pleaser - and the love interest being the one person she doesn’t care about pleasing is amazing.The story is beyond engaging, it went in some directions I didn’t expect it to go, it had me rooting for physics debates, and I could have read another hundred pages of these two.And you know what really REALLY shows how much I love this book? If you’ve been here for a little while you probably know I hate pop culture references in books. Viscerally. This book is at minimum 8% TWILIGHT references, and it was still an easy 5 stars. No question about it.I loved our main couple, I loved the side characters (I would read an entire novella about visits with Millicent), I was super invested in the plot, and the third act and finale is just…everything is so good.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'I think that ending the acknowledgements section of this book with the sentence ""Time is a finite and precious resource, and I\'m constantly overcome with emotion that people choose to spend it on my words"" was not particularly nice of the author to do. But the time isn\'t coming back, and if there\'s one thing I intend to do tonight, it\'s succumb to the sunk cost fallacy. On with the review.I tend to leave Ali Hazelwood alone because I\'m not in her intended demographic (read: person who can see one character responding to another character\'s ignorance about clothes with ""Wow. Men."" without wanting to die), but I picked this up because I saw that the protagonist works as a hired girlfriend, and I wanted to know whether it was going to be offensive or not. It is, which is sad, because the author has clearly worked very hard to make it less so; there\'s a point early when she specifies that the work she doescertainlydoesn\'t include sex, and then reassures us that she does believe sex work is real work, ""and people who engage in it are just as deserving of respect as ballerinas, or firefighters, or hedge fund managers."" Sure! Great! Hedge fund managing is not real work, but I get where you\'re coming from!It\'s just that this comes in the same book as the character referring to cracking a bad pun in order to increase her chances of getting a job as ""this prostitution of my sense of humor"", and the whole premise is that the love interest is the person she can ""be her real self around"", unlike her clients, even though he is 1) on her hiring committee and 2) immediately after he leaves her hiring committee, offers her a job. Also, the heroine\'s roommate, who also works as a hired girlfriend, is ""way too beautiful"" to be good at it without problems. I mean, okay.Honestly, the author just doesn\'t seem particularly interested in the whole premise, except as a way to emphasize that the heroine\'s people-pleasing problems arereallybad—I mean, they\'re so bad that she even... lets herself be PAID to pretend to DATE. The whole line between ""faking being a girlfriend"" and ""working as a girlfriend"" seems pretty unclear to Hazelwood—some of the work entails making up stories to her clients\' family and friends about how the two of them met and whether she\'s being paid, which is obviously faking something, but she also specifies that other gigs just entail ""going places as arm candy"" without talking. I bring this up because I do kind of feel that the author believes (or is working on believing) that sex-adjacent work isn\'t inherently shameful, but she does think on some level itisinherently dishonest. Which: mm.Mainly the reason I feel this way is because the whole arc of the novel is our heroine getting over her people-pleasing tendencies. At this point I need to be clear that this is just not a very well-written character trait. She refers, constantly, to having a different version of herself for every social situation, but what we actually see her do is ""say something nice to a girl who\'s about to cry"", ""crack jokes to someone who enjoys jokes"", ""pretend to like movies she doesn\'t like"", and ""help sort out family problems when her mom asks her to."" At one point she says she\'s about to tell us her tried-and-true procedure for Becoming A Different Person, and it is, in full: 1) Figure out what the other person needs. 2) Plan to do it. 3) Do it. Like—can we get something about, I don\'t know, observing body language? Altering tone? The protagonist references ""code-switching"" by name, but she never seems to use different registers for different situations? Plato identified four types of flattery off the top of his head and he didn\'t even have Google, man, is this really the best we can do? Anyway. You can see how this person would get pushed around a lot, sure (a female romance protagonist? with no backbone? Groundbreaking.), but the shapeshifting social chameleon that we\'re told about just never really appears.What does appear is someone who\'s considerate of others, but absolutely miserable about that, and only feels like her ""real self"" when she\'s yelling at the love interest. From the bottom of my heart: \'kay. How Ithinkthe author intended these scenes to come across, though, is less that the heroine is constantly shapeshifting into new people and more that she is someone constantly in what we might call ""customer service mode"".I feel, generally, weird about the idea that someone who can\'t switch out of customer service mode makes a particularly good escort, and it would remain a kind of weird itch in the back of my brain, but that line about ""prostitution of my sense of humor"" pushes it over the line for me a little. It\'s hard to shake the feeling that Hazelwood has articulated to herself that Elsie is ""prostituting her personality out to everyone she meets"", or something of that nature. (Not sexually, of course! She\'ll describe the sex with her ex that she didn\'t enjoy at all and only had to please him, but she wasn\'t beingpaidfor it!) I feel weird when the heroine reassures the hero that her last client (his brother) is so nice that she ""would have [worked as his girlfriend] for free"". And I feel weirder when the heroine and the hero\'s whole relationship seems to consist of him going ""What do you wanna do?"", her saying, ""What doyouwanna do?"", and him going sternly, ""No... what doyouwanna do?"" until she gets wildly turned on.Like—again, this man is on her hiring committee. I don\'t really buy that she simply can\'t turn on customer-service mode with him just because she can\'t read his face. (In a book where the heroine\'s number one thing is Loving The Twilight Saga, I will admit that ""he\'s the only person whose mind she can\'t read!!!"" as a plot point is absolutely hilarious.) When inauthenticity is so explicitly tied to her escort work, and she falls for him because he aggressively refuses to let her be ""inauthentic"", it feels... kind of like she\'s a ~fallen woman who he\'s saving~, if you see what I mean.Anyway, I should note that she has Type 1 diabetes and, due to sudden and plot-convenient miscalculations of her blood sugar, twice faints dramatically in his arms. It\'s so hard to get a proper case of consumption these days.There are at least three plot-relevant issues of miscommunication that happen because, just as someone is about to say something important, something loud or disgusting happens in the background. Also, the protagonist once describes ""fantasies of filling [the hero] with candy and taking a bat to him"". Time is a finite and precious resource, and it becomes increasingly evident that the Fates have not marked me to spend it on shit that is good. At this point I will accept ""wild"", I guess.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""You need a life-saving advice?

This book has done the impossible:it has redeemed the name of Percy.Yes, that\'s right, that snot-faced, lily-livered waste of air of the very same name from theHarry Potteruniverse. That name is now relegated to the ranks of ""acceptable,"" because of my love for this book.Perseus (Percy) Jackson is the kind of kid with whom you can\'t help sympathizing. He is the type that\'s born under a dark star, because inevitably, wherever he goes, whatever he does, however good his intentions, he can\'t help but fuck everything up. Everything that can, does and will go wrong. A simple field trip can turn into a disaster in seconds.Jay-Z\'s got 99 problems, Percy might have more. He nearly flunks all his classes, he\'s got dyslexia, he\'s got ADHD, and then there\'s Nancy Bobofit.Nancy Bobofit appeared in front of me with her ugly friends—I guess she’d gotten tired of stealing from the tourists—and dumped her half-eaten lunch in Grover’s lap.“Oops.” She grinned at me with her crooked teeth. Her freckles were orange, as if somebody had spray-painted her face with liquid Cheetos.Nancy Bobofit is not a major character in the book. I have to mention her because her character resounded with me. I had my own Nancy Bobofit back in grade school, only her name is Mimi. Nearly 2 decades later, the memory of her horrible face still makes me shudder.

He gets sent to Camp Half-Blood, with roughly 100 other kids like him.It\'s a freaky place for a kid who\'s known nothing but relative normalcy his entire life. All of a sudden, he\'s playing Pinochle with a Greek God (Dionysus---what a drunk), his best friend Grover turns out to be a satyr, and the gorgeous blond girl who rescues him thinks he\'s a doofus and she keeps calling him""seaweed brain.""To be fair, Percy had it coming. He is kind of a seaweed brain.""Another time, Athena and Poseidon competed to be the patron god for the city of Athens. Your dad created some stupid saltwater spring for his gift. My mom created the olive tree. The people saw that her gift was better, so they named the city after her.”“They must really like olives.”“Oh, forget it.”“Now, if she’d invented pizza—that I could understand.”“I said, forget it!”Not your best moment, Percy.As it turned out, Percy IS special. His dad is one of the Big Three gods. Which kind of sucks, because that\'s not supposed to happen.“About sixty years ago, after World War II, the Big Three agreed they wouldn’t sire any more heroes. Their children were just too powerful.""A lot of people would think it was pretty cool to have such a powerful dad...not really.Now that I was declared a son of one of the Big Three gods who weren’t supposed to have kids, I figured it was a crime for me just to be alive.Not only does Percy have to struggle to fit in at Camp Half-Blood, but there\'s some shit going on in Mount Olympus. The gods are fighting again (when are they not)...""During the winter solstice, at the last council of the gods, Zeus and Poseidon had an argument. The usual nonsense: ‘Mother Rhea always liked you best,’ ‘Air disasters are more spectacular than sea disasters,’ et cetera.""...and consequently, like a brother playing a prank on his younger siblings, someone\'s stuff was stolen. And Zeus thinks that his bro, Poseidon, put Percy up to it.Of course, blame the poor kid. Now Percy is shit out of luck YET AGAIN, and he\'s got no choice but to go on this huge stupid quest into the underworld (Los Angeles, ha!) to clear his name.He\'s not alone, he\'s accompanied by thesnarky, gorgeous, fiercely competent Annabeth(she of the seaweed brain name-calling), as well asthe most incompetent satyr that ever lived.In his pocket was a set of reed pipes his daddy goat had carved for him, even though he only knew two songs: Mozart’s Piano Concerto no. 12 and Hilary Duff’s “So Yesterday,” both of which sounded pretty bad on reed pipes.It\'s going to be a loooooooong trip to the Underworld.The Setting: THIS. THIS IS HOW YOU DO GREEK MYTHOLOGY. I am a Greek mythology buff. I FUCKING LOVED THIS BOOK. This book is just absolutely fucking perfect in every way when it comes to rewriting and reinterpreting the Greek pantheon. It is so hilariously, awesomely irreverent, but completely fitting. The gods are reimagined, but they stay true to their true nature, andthe myths are retold in a cheeky, flippant manner that had me giggling my ass off. This book is so fantastically snarky to the Greek gods. Everything is incredibly well-explained to a lay audience, like how the Greek gods can\'t seem to keep it in their pants.Annabeth nodded. “Your father isn’t dead, Percy. He’s one of the Olympians.”“That’s...crazy.”“Is it? What’s the most common thing gods did in the old stories? They ran around falling in love with humans and having kids with them. Do you think they’ve changed their habits in the last few millennia?”And apparently, the habit runs true for both male and female goddesses.“What? You assume it has to be a male god who finds a human female attractive? How sexist is that?”The existence of Greek gods and goddesses themselves are well explained, and believable.“Come now, Percy. What you call ‘Western civilization.’ Do you think it’s just an abstract concept? No, it’s a living force. A collective consciousness that has burned bright for thousands of years. The gods are part of it.""""Did the West die? The gods simply moved, to Germany, to France, to Spain, for a while. Wherever the flame was brightest, the gods were there. They spent several centuries in England. All you need to do is look at the architecture. People do not forget the gods.""I had my doubts about the execution of the premise of Greek mythology, and all my doubts have been destroyed.his book does great justice to the Greek gods, it is the most faithful rendition than I have ever read.The Characters: Yes, Percy is a special snowflake, but HELL, I LOVED THE LITTLE SHIT. He\'s got a special destiny. He is a special child. I DON\'T CARE. Percy is such a sympathetic character, and although he won\'t be replacing Harry Potter in my heart any time soon, there is a special spot for him. He can give up pretty fast. He\'s kind of a wimp, but you know, finding out that you\'re a hald-blooded demigod is kind of a big deal, and I understand his attitude of ""GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.""I didn’t know what else to do. I waved back.“Don’t encourage them,” Annabeth warned. “Naiads are terrible flirts.”“Naiads,” I repeated, feeling completely overwhelmed. “That’s it. I want to go home now.”He doesn\'t really want to do anything big. He\'s pretty stupid sometimes (Auntie Em, geez), he\'s not exactly heroic. He only does the heroic shit when there are no other options.“All right,” I said. “It’s better than being turned into a dolphin.”I loved Annabeth, she is all I could want from a female supporting character. I can\'t say that I\'m fond of Grover...but I can\'t help feeling that we\'ll be seeing more of him in the future.“But a quest to . . .” Grover swallowed. “I mean, couldn’t the master bolt be in some place like Maine? Maine’s very nice this time of year.”Overall: a fantastic book.A good middle grade book makes you feel like a child again, and this book did just the trick.I found myself giggling throughout the book, and an hour after reading it, there\'s still a smile on my face that can\'t be wiped off.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I'm slightly ashamed to say that I watched the movie before I read the book.

Because without his unfreakingbelieveable hotness, I wouldn't have watched the movie, and I would've never read the awesomeness of The Lightning Thief.Yes, I loved the book. I've always taken an interest in Greek Mythology and I thought Rick Riordan's take on it was very unique, and unlike anything I've read before.I absolutely loved Camp- Halfblood. Well, it sure seemed better than the budget summer camps I've been to. RR seriously out did himself with writing the camp. I could imagine everything vividly and I like to think that I know the camp from back to front. The cabins would have to be my favourite feature of the camp, though. If only they were like that in the camps I've been to.Percy. What can I say? The guy has amazing underwater powers, is kick- ass and is a demigod. He's super loyal to his friends and family, is brave and has the looks (this is the part when you look at the gif of Logan Lerman again ;D). And he can make me laugh. Come on. You have to give a guy who make you laugh some credit. In short, the guy's the full package.Another thing I loved were the other characters. Especially Annabeth, who looks like Cinderella in Percy's words (am I right? I don't have the book on me, sorry. Stupid library fines). And I'm expecting something to develop between her and Percy, if you know what I mean....So, yeah. I loved the book, it was exciting, fast- paced and humorous. Just one thing though, I'm kind of pissed that they didn't have cabins in the movie. Or Clarisse. Or the Oracle. Though it's hardly RR's fault. I just had to get it out there.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""When I was about halfway through this book, I started making a list of its similarities to Harry Potter. Here is a sampling from that list:1. There are three young heroes: a brainy girl (Annabeth/Hermione), a funny screw-up type (Grover/Ron), and a somewhat troubled but very brave lead (Harry/Percy).2. People freak when the Harry/Percy character says the name of a powerful character.3. The main bad guy (Kronos/Voldemort) is seeking to return to his former power, but most people are totally in denial of that happening.4. The heroes train at a school that divides its students according to their character. (Chiron, the head trainer of the camp, equals Dumbledore.)5. Chiron/Dumbledore knows a prophecy about Percy/Harry but won't tell Percy/Harry what it is exactly.6. Percy/Harry has a gross stepfather named Smelly Gabe who protects him during his childhood, so Smelly Gabe obviously equals the Dursleys.7. Harry/Percy can talk to a certain animal because of his special gifts (Harry could talk to snakes, Percy can talk to horses).8. Riordan's three young heroes face down a three-headed dog at the end of their big quest, which if I'm not mistaken is exactly what happens in HP1 (granted, the three-headed dog is straight out of Greek mythology, so I should cut Riordan some slack on this one).I could go on (and on and on) which would be fun for me, but I won't. Instead, I'll shock you by saying that I totally loved this completely derivative book. It's super fun and fast-moving and the fact that it's kind of a HP rip-off actually makes me like it more.

Pretty perfect message, if you ask me.I know, I know - this is plain old childhood wish fulfillment at its finest. But who cares? The best kids books are all about wish fulfillment to some extent and it\'s not like Percy Jackson doesn\'t have his fair share of enemies and heartache. It\'s the same idea that we all loved to buy into. The orphaned and neglected Harry Potter discovering he is a wizard. The nerdy loser-ish Peter Parker developing special abilities and becoming Spiderman. Children in the middle of WWII discovering a secret world through a wardrobe door in which they reign as royalty. Percy Jackson finding out he is the son of a god and has his own super powers.On top of the powerful message, this is a fast-paced exciting fantasy story full of friendships, Greek mythology, magic, mystery, bad guys and girls, and constant adventure. I enjoyed it now, despite me being a good ten years older than the target audience. I would have enjoyed it even more ten years ago. You should definitely go read this.

His life turning upside down when during a school trip to a museum he is attacked and nearly killed by a harpy. Not every day you realize you are the illegitimate son of a god and that you are being hunted down by mythological monsters. What follows is a narrow escape to Camp Half Blood, home and refuge for all the unrecognized offspring of the many Olympus deities. Things do not get better when he realizes his birth signifies the violation of a sacred millennial oath, gets accused for stealing the thunder of Zeus, and the possibility of a full scale heavenly war escalating to a point of no return.2014 was the best year of my young reader’s life. Bought a tablet, discovered Goodreads, and with it an endless sea of possibilities and books I never knew existed. That year I devoured all the Giver, Hunger Games and Divergent series one after the other, but Percy Jackson was my very first.I just loved Percy, Annabeth, Grover and Sally. Hated so much Gabe! And Clarisse, at least at the beginning. I was completely enamored by the world building and all of its fantastic characters, the greek mythology references, the never ending reveals, the engrossing story progression, and the nonstop action. This book was unmatched YA heaven. How can I ever forget Camp Half Blood, the Lotus Casino, the fights against so many mythological figures like the Minotaur, the Furies, Medusa, Echidna, Chimera, Ares, Cerberus... So many endearing and heartbreaking moments to remember byThe Minotaur and the Pearl scenes!. The big ending revealwith Lukewas kind of a letdown, but a very decent ending nonetheless. And hey, what book is perfect? It was so close though! A terrific beginning for one of my most beloved fantasy series ever. Highly Recommendable for YA Fantasy lovers, and adults with a child at heart.*** The movie (2010) was a joke and one of the most disappointing adaptations I've ever watched. I mean it was so awkwardly filmed! The moderately faithful plot and the great special effects were there, granted, and maybe even some of the acting too; but it all felt so clumsy and disjointed! And so many things were cut out. It was all so sad, the intention was clearly there, but the spirit was definitely not. Hardly a match to the book. Lerman and Daddario may have been ok, at best; but Brosnan as Chiron was so laughable. And the ending so insulting to the series progression!Fighting Kronos? Really??? Like they couldn’t wait to throw the biggest final antagonist of the series right at the beginning. And inexperienced newcomer Percy winning so easily, against the most dreadfully powerful god ever. Give me a break!Sadly, Not Recommendable.

Su vida dando un vuelco total cuando durante una visita escolar a un museo es atacado y casi asesinado por una harpía. No todos los días te enterás que sos el hijo ilegítimo de un dios y que estás siendo cazado por monstruos mitológicos. Lo que sigue es un estrecho escape a Campo Mestizo, hogar y refugio para todos los no reconocidos descendientes de las muchas deidades del Olimpo. Las cosas no mejoras cuando comprende que su nacimiento significa la violación de un milenario pacto, es acusado de robar el rayo de Zeus, y la posibilidad de una guerra celestial a gran escala se acerca a un punto de no retorno.2014 fue el mejor año de mi joven vida lectora. Compré una tablet, descubrí Goodreads, y con ello un océano infinito de libros y posibilidades que jamás sabía que existía. Ese año devoré todos los libros de la saga Dador, Juegos del Hambre y Divergente uno tras de otro, pero Percy Jackson fue mi más primero.Simplemente amé a Percy, Annabeth, Grover y Sally. ¡Odié tanto a Gabe! Y a Clarisse, al menos al principio. Completamente fascinado por la construcción del mundo y todos sus maravillosos personajes, las referencias a la mitología griega, las continuas revelaciones, la cautivante progresión de la historia, y la acción sin final. Este libro fue tan completamente un cielo de lo Joven Adulto. Cómo podría olvidar el Campamento Mestizo, el Casino Loto, las peleas contra tantas figuras mitológicas como el Minotauro, las Furias, Medusa, Equidna, Quimera, Ares, Cerbero… Tantas entrañables y terribles momentos para recordar¡La escena del Minotauro y las Perlas!. La gran revelación finalcon Lukefue un poco decepcionante, pero un decente final sin embargo. Y además, ¿qué libro es perfecto? ¡Aunque estuvo tan cerca! Un espectacular comienzo para una de mis más queridas series de fantasía jamás. Altamente Recomendable para los amantes de la Fantasía Joven Adulto, y adultos con un niño en el corazón.*** La película (2010) fue una gansada y una de las más decepcionantes adaptaciones que vi jamás. ¡O sea fue todo tan raramente filmado! La trama moderadamente fiel y los geniales efectos especiales estuvieron ahí, concedido, y tal vez incluso algo de la actuación también; ¡pero todo se sintió tan mal e inconexo! Y tantas cosas dejadas afuera. Fue todo tan triste, la intención claramente estuvo ahí, pero el espíritu definitivamente no. Difícilmente comparable al libro. Lerman y Daddario tal vez estuvieron ok, cuando mucho; pero Brosnan como Quirón fue lamentable. ¡Y el final tan insultante a la progresión de la serie!¿Pelear contra Cronos? ¿¿¿En serio??? Como si no pudieran esperar para lanzar al mayor antagonista final de la serie directo al principio. Y el inexperto recién llegado Percy ganándole tan fácilmente, contra el más terriblemente poderoso dios jamás. ¡Por favor!Lamentablemente, No Recomendable. ¡Aunque muchos puntos para Sean Bean por no morir!-----------------------------------------------NOTA PERSONAL:[2005] [377p] [Fantasía] [Joven Adulto] [Altamente Recomendable]-----------------------------------------------""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""EDIT 09/06/2013:-That's it.

Read at the expense of having to respect someone else's views.---------What a feeble attempt at recreating the Harry Potter magic! Aside from being highly unoriginal and unimaginative, the book grates on your nerves due to the frequency of Percy's lame attempts at sounding witty. Seriously, I'm supposed to laugh at his observations on the'Bull Man'and'barnyard animals'?Not only did the writer not bother racking his brains to come up with a plot or a proper story, choosing instead to recycle key elements of the Harry Potter series, but he also ignored important aspects of a fantasy novel, one of which is the language. To call the narration just bad will be an understatement. Same can be said about the dialogue and the way the plot progresses - it's one cliched event unfolding after another.The only novel thing about this book is the seamless integration of Greek mythology into a fantasy-based set-up. The 1 star is for that.And so I'd like to put a premature end to my review because I just realized the futility of writing one of a book I hated.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '(A-) 82%| Very GoodNotes:Revival by amping, old myths, modern camping, showcases America in Greek esoterica, a clever, kinetic, revamping.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '""You need to study war, punk.""Given how well received this book is (and the entire series), I was looking forward to continue my fantasy to-read list with Percy Jackson and the Olympians for a while now.

Still, I think the environs were adequately defined. The main characters - including the first person protagonist - were interesting, fun and delightful to observe. However, for me, the secondary characters appeared a little too funny, even when they were supposed to be threatening. It took away some of the suspense/ thrill that could\'ve been there in my opinion. And also, if the set of main characters were a little older, may be things would appear a little more realistic (relatively). But as the plot itself is great, it\'s easy to forget those shortcomings, and enjoy the story. Obviously, none of these would matter to kids at all, who will find the entire thing to be quite entertaining. Sequence of events is very well thought out, and laid out in a way that will make you want to read the entire thing in one go, which is not difficult to do actually, as the book is not very long.

And once you know that, it's only a matter of time before they sense it too, and they'll come for you.Don't say I didn't warn you.My name is Percy Jackson.Most people already know the story of Percy Jackson and how he found out he was a half-blood. How he ended up in a half-blood camp (almost didn't) How he beat a Minotaur and later on, many things.I thought it was a fun read and I loved all of the different mythical creatures! That was so wicked cool!Percy makes some good friends in the camp and they go with him to do a quest. He has been blamed for stealing something from Zeus, which he did not, so they have to set out to find who really did it. Other wise there is going to be some knock down drag out with Zeus and Percy's father (Poseidon) and others of course.So they set out on this quest.They have to go have a little chat with Hades <-- fun times. They get attacked by many creatures of all shapes and sizes. They also get help from certain creatures and a pink poodle named Gladiola who ran away from home and doesn't want to go back but does so the kids can have some reward money. Wasn't that sweet!↑ Can you blame little Gladiola? I mean I love the color pink, but NO, JUST NO!Anyhoo, I did want to smack the group a few times because of stupid things, but who doesn't do those from time to time. *raises hand* I loved when they saved the animals in the old truck they were riding in, Grover is awesome!I look forward to reading ALL of the other 50 billion books in this ongoing Rick Riordan world! ♥MY BLOG:Melissa Martin's Reading List""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Perfect for those who love mythologyThis should come as no big shocker given that my pen name is Lisa of Troy, but I love Greek mythology. The problem with Greek mythology is that the language is so archaic that I usually spend more time reading the reference materials than the original text.Recently, there have been some efforts to modernize the myths and make them more accessible.The Lightning Thief jumps right into action, no 100-page warm-up here. No droning on and on about Greek mythology. It is also highly readable with short paragraphs and sentences.One thing that I didn’t like is the portrayal of the Greek gods. In Greek mythology, the gods are heartless. No one is safe even children. This is one aspect that makes mythology so shocking; it doesn’t follow traditional social norms. The Lightning Thief is geared towards the YA audience, so I suppose Riordan made the right call in toning the book down a bit.The Lightning Thief is so good that I picked up a buddy reader. I was listening to the audiobook on the couch (that happens more than you would think), and my family member started listening too. I kept asking if I could read the book by myself, and I kept being told, “No! No!

The message, as so often, is thatIt´s completely ok to be differentAnd that individual character traits and issues are nothing that legitimizes stigmatization, or the tendency to give pills and psychotropic drugs instead of alternatives such as therapy in not so severe cases. But that´s more of an unimportant sidenote, the really big riddle and mystery is the question which manifestation of a classic god will come next in which outfit, style, and with which modified abilities. This searching for the signs, hints, and innuendos isWhat makes it so appealing for adult readers tooIt´s not just quick, clever, and witty, one is also permanently questioning which obvious or deep and subtle disguise ones favorite mythological figure might have chosen. Riordan milked this concept in other series with different mythologies from around the world, or at least Scandinavia and Egypt (as far as I know but I´m a bit outdated so there might already be fresher serialized stuff ) and it always worked out fine because it´s so fresh and original. And even Gods have to evolve to stay up to date, funky, and fresh for the true believer.If you like that kind of easygoing, but still ironic and somewhat even postmodern, kind of entertainment in the comedic fantasy YA and adult sector, Terry Pratchett, Jonathan Stroud, Walter Moers, Brandon Mull, and everything in similar amazon comparison or goodreads listopia genre/author meta suggestion function could be your new reading drug of choice.

Percy Jackson was one of those series that was always there, just on the periphery of my social conscious. I knew I should read it, but for one reason or another I gravitated to other things instead.Thankfully, as an adult who likes reviewing books for fun in my spare time, I have absolutely no shame about reading the series now, even if it was originally intended for a younger audience. In some ways, I think I might have even enjoyed it more as an adult.I'm a huge fan of Greek mythology. (I may or may not have filled electives in high school and college with classes on mythology; just like I may or may not have obsessed over shows like Xena and Hercules in my teenage years.) I had a great time comparing my own personal knowledge of Greek mythology against the ways that Riordan weaves the stories into Percy's larger adventure.It's such a fun way to introduce Greek mythology to children and teens while staying entertaining for adults as well! The mythology remains faithful to the original stories, but it feels fresh and fun here as each character is full of personality and charm. The world is full of magic and wonder and I never once felt bored as the characters explored within it.Speaking of characters full of personality, Percy Jackson himself is one of my new faves in terms of characterization. He's brave, loyal and hilarious and his friendship with Grover and Annabeth has quickly become a favorite for me. Also, can I just say that I think it's so cute that Riordan based Percy on his son, who had been diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia? I think it's so awesome that Percy gets to sort of stand apart from other heroes in stories as a champion for those kids forevermore.When I finished reading this book, I immediately went and told my 11 year old nephew that he absolutely had to read this book so I had someone to talk to about it.

In twelve spellbinding new stories, Enriquez writes about ordinary people, especially women, whose lives turn inside out when they encounter terror, the surreal, and the supernatural. A neighborhood nuisanced by ghosts, a family whose faces melt away, a faded hotel haunted by a girl who dissolved in the water tank on the roof, a riverbank populated by birds that used to be women—these and other tales illuminate the shadows of contemporary life, where the line between good and evil no longer exists.Lyrical and hypnotic, heart-stopping and deeply moving, Enriquez’s stories never fail to enthrall, entertain, and leave us shaken.

Es, sin dudarlo ni un segundo, mi autora contemporánea favorita. La conocí en el 2017 con “Las cosas que perdimos en el fuego”, y fue un viaje de ida: desde ese momento supe que iba a leer todo lo que publicara. En términos de ficción, leí todo y, sacando alguno que otro, todo me gustó. Ya tengo bien claro su estilo, su forma de desarrollar personajes y escenarios, y son el motivo por el cual amo leerla. Con esta antología sentí que estaba leyendo una reescritura de sus cuentos anteriores. No encontré nada nuevo, nada diferente de lo que ya había leído en su obra. Hay un combo que se repite incansablemente: la marginalidad, los tópicos sobrenaturales en los que se involucran figuras paganas, settings con carga histórica heavy (como centros clandestinos), entre otras.Si bien sus finales suelen ser ambiguos y bastante abiertos, me parece que en esta oportunidad se marca de manera más excesiva, dejando una sensación extraña de insuficiencia e incertidumbre, como si los relatos estuvieran inconclusos. Me gusta completar las historias con sugestión e imaginación, pero a veces es un toque cansador. En otros casos, sentí que los cierres no le hacían justicia al resto del relato. Algo así me pasó con “Julie”, que toca un tema que me fascina, y es el de las sesiones de espiritismo, el contacto con el más allá. Siento que la historia realmente quedó a medio camino, con un desarrollo muy precipitado y algo decepcionante.También, siento que estoy de acuerdo con algo que mencionaron mucho por acá, y es el hecho de que se nota bastante que muchos guiños van dedicados al público estadounidense. Hubo algo en toda esa cuestión que me hizo sentir muy ajena a su obra, algo que nunca me había pasado. Muchos asuntos sobreexplicados que solo desvían el foco de la trama principal. Lo entiendo, su público lector se amplió, y algunas cosas que para el lector nacional son obviedades, definitivamente no son tan evidentes para el afuera.Independientemente de todo esto, creo que ningún relato es malo, simplemente monotemáticos en algún punto. Quizá encontré más relatos que no me engancharon tanto, si los comparo con otras antologías suyas que me parecían más equilibradas. Dicho esto, mis relatos favoritos fueron: “Mis muertos tristes” (que me recordó un poco a “El gran despertar”, de Julia Armfield, el relato que le da nombre a la antología), “Diferentes colores hechos de lágrimas” (que me recordó a “El vestido de terciopelo”, de Silvina Ocampo), “Una artista local” y “Ojos negros”.'}, {'rating': None, 'content': 'Mariana Enríquez usa este nuevo volumen de relatos de terror para explicar el mundo actual a través de sus cuentos. En esta obra inspirada, original y rabiosamente reconocible como de la propia autora, Enríquez se acerca a algunas de las obsesiones que, como sociedad, tenemos instaladas en lo más profundo de nuestra psique colectiva.«Un lugar soleado para gente sombría» es un compendio literario en el que la autora canaliza sus obsesiones (que, ahora, también son las de sus lectoras). Al igual que en sus otros libros, aquí la perspectiva es netamente personal y llena de tropos identificables como «marianos»: la historia de Argentina en el siglo XX, lo rural versus lo urbano, las diferencias de forma de vida entre las distintas clases sociales, los monstruos que habitan entre nosotros versus los monstruos que habitan en otros mundos, la pervivencia de las emociones humanas incluso en los momentos más terribles...Mariana consigue ejecutar un libro adictivo, multiprismático y sensorial que se distingue como otro acierto en su bibliografía. Es un libro que sabe a vino caliente, que huele a flores casi podridas, que suena a rock psicodélico, que tiene la apariencia de un ser mitológico moribundo. No sé si, como sociedad, nos merecemos disfrutar de su literatura, pero ojalá Mariana nos siga muchos años regalando su talento y haciendo del mundo un lugar más hermoso, pero también más oscuro e inquietante.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '[4.1⭐] 𝙐𝙣 𝙡𝙪𝙜𝙖𝙧 𝙨𝙤𝙡𝙚𝙖𝙙𝙤 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙖 𝙜𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙚 𝙨𝙤𝙢𝙗𝙧𝙞́𝙖 es una colección de cuentos en la que Mariana Enriquez despliega su habilidad para entrelazar lo cotidiano y lo sobrenatural, logrando un terror profundamente psicológico y cargado de crítica social. En estos doce relatos publicados en 2024, la escritora explora miedos sociales y personales, partiendo de situaciones cotidianas y transformándolas en experiencias inquietantes que llevan al lector a cuestionar los límites entre lo real y lo fantástico.Es mi primer acercamiento con la autora, he aprovechado que han comprado este libro en la biblioteca de mi universidad para poder sumergirme de una buena vez por todas con Enríquez. Claramente, con mi calificación ya pueden ver que ha sido un buen inicio.Uno de los aspectos que más destaco es cómo la autora refleja la situación actual de Argentina, con sus problemas económicos y las dificultades en las que vive mucha gente. Aunque se nota este contexto, sus cuentos no parecen estar atados a un momento específico, lo que los hace sentir universales y les da un impacto emocional más fuerte. Incluso, cuando menciona detalles de la pandemia de 2020, como el uso de mascarillas, eso no le quita ese aire de intemporalidad.Después de haber leído los cuentos de Agustina Bazterrica, no pude evitar comparar constantemente a estas dos autoras. Como la colección de Bazterrica no me gustó, no he hecho más que elogiar a Enríquez en cada uno de sus cuentos; incluso, me atrevo a decir que no hay ningún relato de ella que considere malo. Es cierto que algunos me gustaron más que otros, pero ninguno me pareció terrible.Algunos cuentos logran exhibir miedos y traumas colectivos, como la pobreza y las cicatrices de la violencia estatal, mientras que otros exploran el deterioro físico y la violencia de género. Enriquez presenta estas temáticas sin caer en lo explícito; su capacidad para sugerir el horror sin mostrarlo directamente es parte de lo que hace que su obra sea tan efectiva. Además, el hecho de que la autora juegue con lo psicológico provoca que sus cuentos te lleven a un viaje oscuro y envolvente que cumple su objetivo de causar miedo y reflexión.Finalmente, puedo decir que 𝙐𝙣 𝙡𝙪𝙜𝙖𝙧 𝙨𝙤𝙡𝙚𝙖𝙙𝙤 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙖 𝙜𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙚 𝙨𝙤𝙢𝙗𝙧𝙞́𝙖 es un libro que me pareció fascinante y aterrador en partes iguales.

Scott Fitzgerald. That notion of half-buried perversity works well to convey the flavour of Enríquez’s latest short-story collection. It taps into her ongoing fascination with ‘the dark side of the everyday,’ and her sense that ‘horror flows from the real.’ Less pronounced horror, more weird fiction, Enríquez’s preoccupations here are consistent with earlier work. So, there’s an emphasis on the Junta’s legacies, unsettling echoes of its atrocities reverberating through an Argentina that’s never fully confronted the past. But equally Enríquez’s intent on exploring contemporary Argentina’s fault lines from femicide to corruption, urban decay and deep-seated, social inequality.Enríquez opens with “My Sad Dead” set in a middle-class Buenos Aires enclave - indirectly referencing Rudolfo Fogwill’s writings about Argentina’s marginalised. Emma, divorced, former doctor, lives alone in an apartment complex. Her neighbours are obsessed with staving off local inhabitants they consider a threat - out to rob or terrorise them. I suspect their investment in gentrification, their security systems, their right-wing diatribes, their insistence on eye-for-an-eye justice, will be familiar to many readers, not just those linked to Argentina. For Emma this place is a potent reminder that ‘fascism starts with fear and then turns into hatred.” But Emma’s grief over her mother’s recent death opens her up to other ways of seeing. She’s accosted by ghostly presences who spark an awareness of harsh realities facing the less affluent communities close to Emma’s own. All of which forces Emma to contemplate her likely complicity in the crimes witnessed from her windows. It’s an admirably disciplined piece, meticulously detailed, moving and unsettling.The title story that follows mirrors aspects of “My Sad Dead.” Enríquez fixes her gaze on contradictions inherent in American society, exposed through the experiences of an Argentine journalist visiting Los Angeles to research a feature. Enríquez draws on the real-life mystery surrounding the 2013 death of Elisa Lam, found decomposing in a water tank on the roof of the seedy Cecil Hotel. The Argentine journalist’s there to interview members of a cult that’s grown up around Lam, people camped out around the water tank awaiting the dead girl’s messages. The woman journalist travels through nearby streets filled with evidence of drug addiction, poverty and extensive homelessness. L.A. seems not that much different from Enríquez’s earlier portrait of Buenos Aires, except that L.A.s geographical divides between the haves and have-nots are that much wider.The sinister “Face of Disgrace” centres on the policing and brutalisation of women, gender inequalities, damaging family dynamics. The frustratingly sketch-like “Julie” is inspired by the life of occultist Marjorie Cameron. Enríquez probes stigmas around “non-normative” bodies, while delving into colourism, as well as conflicts between those who stayed in Argentina during turbulent times and those who left. “Night Birds” moves away from Enriquez’s brand of skewed realism towards gothic, fairy tale. It’s set in Paraná famous for birds and bird-watching. But in Enriquez’s Paraná birds have an otherworldly appearance, seemingly transformations of human women. Enríquez’s narrative brings in Tupi-Guarani mythology for a macabre reimagining of surrealist artist Mildred Burton’s early life – here known as Milly. It’s a fragmentary piece that possibly works best viewed as an oblique tribute to an artist known for her commitment to human rights: her work with the mothers and grandmothers of those “disappeared” by the military junta; her artworks highlighting gender-based murder. Themes of gender and transformation are also central to “Metamorphosis.” Influenced by Cronenberg, it’s a vivid account of a woman undergoing medical menopause which constructs a searing critique of the treatment of women’s illnesses, the near-routine dismissal of their pain. But this particular woman finds a unique way to transform disregarded suffering into shining celebration.In the powerful but uneven “Hyena Hymns” a gay couple temporarily escapes their stay with censorious parents to explore an abandoned building. Enríquez based this on an actual castle in the Argentine Pampas, once requisitioned for a concentration camp, one of many torture and detention centres scattered over Argentina during the military dictatorship. In a variation on stone tape theory and/or notions of place memory, the couple’s uncanny encounter inside its walls reflects Enríquez’s compulsion to address Argentina’s collective amnesia. Her story’s centred on notions of the repressed, troubled past spilling over into the present, invested in going beyond its facts to examine feelings these might stir. She combines this with observations on contemporary problems from poor urban management to corruption resulting in contaminated water supplies. “Different Colours Made of Tears” takes its name from the Velvet Underground’s “Venus in Furs.” But here the glamourous garb of a long-dead woman, offered to a vintage clothing store, harbours secrets of male domination and malevolent misogyny - Enríquez’s attempt to represent violence against women without reproducing it. It’s filled with striking imagery but feels a little underdeveloped as does “The Suffering Woman” which deals with anxieties around frailty and death.The eerie “The Refrigerator Cemetery,” with its exploration of denial pierced by moments of devastating guilt, also blends the horrors of Argentina’s past with those of its present. It’s a striking piece set in an urban wasteland, its references to legends of immurement and child sacrifice suggestive of inverted folk horror. In the deliciously Lovecraftian “A Local Artist” a holidaying couple in an isolated spot get more than they bargained for when they visit a local artist whose reputation resembles that of an outlaw saint. Enríquez's final piece edges closer to full-on horror. “Black Eyes” follows a group of workers, assigned to feed a large homeless community, suddenly besieged by two bizarrely unnerving children.Although not always entirely successful, Enríquez’s mutated realities are never less than arresting. Intriguing, sometimes outstanding, takes on generational trauma, on mortality, precarity, the silenced, and the displaced.

But the latter selection feel B list: they're not bad but the writing feels a bit more pedestrian and the tales themselves fall into a type that we expect from this writer and other women from Latin America who are using Gothic and horror tropes to convey political and social commentary.What makes the first set of stories so exciting for me is the way they pack an emotional punch alongside the expected imagination. Rape, femicide, drug use, street violence, migration all appear in various guises alongside ghostly and monstrous presences, marginalised voices and communities.There's a particularly interesting metamorphic strand which uses Latin American rather than classical myths in some of the stories, displacing what usually pass for origin tales. And there's a dark humour at work such as in 'Metamorphosis' where a woman decries the way no-one has told her how her post-menopausal body will become alien to her.For me, the truly excellent stories more than made up for the lacklustre fillers - and there are some stunners here.Many thanks to Granta for an ARC via NetGalley""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""A Sunny Place for Shady Peoplecollects twelve of Mariana Enriquez' short stories which heavily focus on social ills and real life horror, mixed with a touch of supernatural terror. Again again, the ghosts of the forgotten, the neglected, the poor, the children, the abused, the murdered, the revengeful; but also the rough life on the streets of Buenos Aires, a burned down zoo, mental illnesses, folklore, drama, body horror, and even some Lovecraftian dread, worm-like people, a seaside town, fever dreams, terrible portraits painted by artists who got the call...I loved reading all stories, but of course I have my highlights;Different Colors Made Of Tearsin which the employees of a vintage clothing store discover that clothes donated by a certain gentleman make the wearer feel exactly how his late wife, to whom the clothes belonged, felt before she died. My sister works in a store which rents historical costumes to filmmakers, and I absolutely love visiting her, as the sheer volume of clothes everywhere just gives an incredibly unique vibe not comparable to anything, and to know that they have been worn by people, sometimes by people who are dead now... That's a feeling which Enriquez perfectly captured in this story, the descriptions of the clothes and jewels were as spectacular as the dresses themselves must have been.Another favorite isA Local Artistfor the suckers of Lovecraftian horror, art horror and Thomas Ligotti. I'm not saying more.This is definitely one of the best horror collections published this year and a big relief for me personally, as I wasn't a big fan of the author's last novel,Our Share of Night. Enriquez proved that she still delivers when it comes to short stories.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Doce cuentos perturbadores que utilizan recursos como el arte pictórico, las mitologías de la periferia argentina, las leyendas urbanas extendidas por internet y hasta el horror cósmico lovecraftiano.

Enriquez is the only author who has managed to absolutely terrify me with just the power of her words and imagery. This collection, like her previous two, explores the gothic horror of Buenos Aires and looks at both the paranormal and the strangeness of the city and the people who inhabit it. The stories felt a lot more muted at first and I was worried this was going to be a weak collection, but the last three stories in this book absolutely blew me away. They were just incredible and it reminded me of how amazing and unique she is as a writer. The last three stories are what really bumped the rating up for me. I'm really excited for this to get out into the world and for everyone to read more of her work because she is just fantastic at making your skin crawl and an absolute staple of Latin American horror.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Having long been a fan of Mariana Enríquez’s short stories – especially the superbThings We Lost in the Fire,the first of her books to be translated into English – I was excited to get stuck in to this brand-new collection. ‘Face of Disgrace’ is creepy and genuinely disturbing at points; ‘Different Colours Made of Tears’ has good character work and a strong voice; both of them are anchored by original concepts. ‘A Sunny Place for Shady People’ is unexpectedly poignant, ‘A Local Artist’ starts strong and has a well-realised setting. Unfortunately, most of the rest don’t get much better than merely ‘fine’. There’s little here that lives up toThings We Lost in the Fire,or even the earlier, less polishedThe Dangers of Smoking in Bed.Not for the first time, I wonder why the synopsis and marketing of a book doesn’t reflect the actual content of the book.Sunny Placeis sold as a collection of macabre stories exploring ‘love, womanhood, LGBTQ counterculture, parenthood and Argentina’s brutal past’. I’m not sure I could locate some of these themes in the book if I tried (did I miss whatever the ‘LGBTQ counterculture’ part was supposed to be?) This is a collection that leans heavily on body horror; it’s really the main theme that runs through most of the stories, so it’s weird this isn’t mentioned anywhere. Body horror is a specific flavour of horror, and while it has been present in Enríquez’s stories before, it’s more prevalent here, and much blunter too. This results in the type of horror story I admire rather than like. I appreciate it takes skill to get under the reader’s skin, to provoke disgust, but I don’t feel pleasantly spooked by these kind of stories, just a bit nauseous.I’m tempted to wonder if something was lost in translation here – and not just the title (which sounds bizarrely cheesy in English, and strikes entirely the wrong tone for the book). Two of the stories are based on urban legends that are so well-known as to border on cliche; I initially assumed these must be less well-known in Argentina... except I’ve been looking through the reviews in Spanish, and a recurring criticism there is that Enríquez is trying too hard to tailor her style for Western audiences. Finally, to go back to the body horror thing: honestly, I didn’t enjoy the way many of these stories use disability or disease to incite fear. Maybe this has always been a feature of Enríquez’s writing and I haven’t picked up on it enough; maybe there’s just a lot more of it in this book. Either way, I wasn’t comfortable with it.I received an advance review copy ofA Sunny Place for Shady Peoplefrom the publisher throughEdelweiss.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '2.5 estrellasme gustaron mucho mucho dos cuentos (""un lugar soleado para gente sombría"" y ""ojos negros""). al resto los sentí desmembrados, mal estructurados, poco sólidos. algunos hasta obvios. hay algo de la sutileza y el juego con lo no dicho de sus otros libros que en estos cuentos no está.por otro lado, también siento una bajada de línea muy fuerte por parte de la editorial. veo claras intenciones de perfilarla para el público internacional. por ejemplo, en explicar cosas que en argentina son obvias (cómo te roban paseándote por cajeros automáticos, qué es el jugo tang). o, también, una corrección política que nunca había sentido en mariana y que, siento, no viene ni en pedo de ella sino de un editor que le dijo ""con esto los yankis te cancelan"". por ejemplo, un narrador que dice ""sé que está mal decir esto y no debería sentirlo, pero... *opinión controversial*"". esto último es lo que más bronca me da.incluso hubo momentos en los que pensé ""por qué mierda haces que me quede en esta historia"". me pasó con ""cementerio de heladeras"". creo que fue el que menos me gustó porque no construye verosímil, en las primeras dos páginas ya te das cuenta lo que pasó y más o menos lo que va a pasar y, sin embargo, el cuento se estira por 15 páginas con idas y vueltas que son un embole. jamás me había pasado con mariana.en fin. calculo que una persona que nunca leyó a la autora puede flashearla bastante. o una persona menos quisquillosa que yo. pero fue una decepción.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Valoraciones relatos:-Mis muertos tristes 6/10.-Los pájaros de la noche 6.5/10.-La desgracia en la cara 6.75/10.-Julia 5.5/10-Metamorfosis 5/10.-Un lugar soleado para gente sombría 4/10.-Los himnos de las hienas 6/10.-Diferentes colores hechos de lágrimas 6/10.-La mujer que sufre 5.5/10.-Cementerio de heladeras 7/10.-Un artista local 7/10.-Ojos negros 6.5/10.Valoración total: 5.98 redondeo 6/10.Sinopsis: Quien ose adentrarse en las páginas de este libro sentirá un escalofrío recorriéndole la espina dorsal, y algunas cosas más.

En otra pieza, los voluntarios de una ONG que reparte comida por barrios marginales son perseguidos por unos niños de pavorosos ojos negros.

But then again, many of the narrating protagonists are prejudiced in some way bearing on their stories–often sanist or ableist. I think I get what Enriquez was trying to do with it all, but it was hard to read. Was that the point?Don\'t get me wrong–this is really good fiction, and I recommend it. Buy consider this my content warning for sanism, ableism, ageism, and racism.Full review:Thank you to the author Mariana Enriquez, publishers Hogarth, and NetGalley for an advance digital copy of A SUNNY PLACE FOR SHADY PEOPLE. All views are mine.“Yes, they know the basement was used for torture. But the place was a lot of other things, too. A summer house for those rich people, who by the way made all that cheese you ate last night, so you’ve already got Evil in you.p101A SUNNY PLACE is my third read from Mariana Enriquez, and I just love her work. She always challenges me, both emotionally and intellectually, which is what reading is all about for me. I want to feel and think in New ways as a result of what I\'ve read. Enriquez always delivers.This collection felt personal to me because of the frequency with which it centered disability and mental illness. I wasn\'t always comfortable with her treatment of these subjects, as a reader affected by both topics. But I really felt like she was challenging me to empathize with characters and thought systems that I didn\'t understand. I just don\'t see how that\'s bad.I always recommend Enriquez\'s work, and this collection is no different. But this collection fairly demands the right readers. I recommend this for fans of weird horror/fiction, pink horror, feminist horror, diverse horror authors, settings, and characters.Reading NotesThree (or more) things I loved:1. Her handling of Gothic elements is just chef\'s kiss omg.2. This is how you do a run-on!He always told me he liked Hispanic women because they seemed strong and maternal and I’d get mad, that awful gringo stereotype, and he laughed and I never again saw a laugh like that, with those beautiful teeth that the street and the madness couldn’t ruin, all the joy that lit up every one of his features and made his eyes shine, he who was always so somber and blue, except when he turned manic and life seemed beautiful to him, but that was just as heartbreaking because it was only a chemical reaction, he had no idea what he was feeling or saying.p36Three (or less) things I didn\'t love:This section isn\'t only for criticisms. It\'s merely for items that I felt something for other than ""love"" or some interpretation thereof.1. I\'ve seen this author do it before, rely on mental health stigma as a horror element. I hate it, it\'s bullshit. But she writes great horror otherwise. *edit I think Enriquez is not promoting the prejudices she presents in her characters and stories, but challenging them.2.She seemed beyond saving to me: some people just let themselves go for too long, and one day they wake up crazy and monstrous. That’s how Julie was. Full-on abandonment. And we didn’t even know exactly what was wrong with her.p64 This ableism clearly originates with the narrating character, but it\'s a common trope and one I\'ve seen Enriquez use before. In reality, the mysteriously ill are not beyond saving. No sick or disabled person is beyond saving, because no person is. *edit:It’s not easy to differentiate between a bad mood and returning depression. But I know: it’s a bad mood. I think of last night, when we’d f*cked and gone to sleep with the window open, waiting for the black storm over the mountains, and yes, it’s a bad mood.p96 This is brilliant mental health rep, and it makes me think when she is ableist, even though that is often, that she means to be for a literary reasons.3. Many of the stories here end on an extremely abstract note. It\'s hard to say what Enriquez is trying to say with this repeated technique.Rating: 🧛\u200d♂️🧛\u200d♂️🧛\u200d♂️🧛\u200d♂️ /5 clever monstersRecommend?

""My Sad Dead"" - a creepy, sad ghost story about how ghosts haunt the pitiless, but never remorse:Would I have opened the door? Or would I have acted like all the others?” “Maybe you wouldn’t have opened,” he answered. “But you would have at least called the police. They didn’t even do that?” “They didn’t even do that,” I replied.p262. ""A Sunny Place For Shady People"" - A complex story about grief and the inability to let go.3. ""Face of Disgrace"" - Holy crap I am never going to hear a whistle the same way again! This story is haunting.4. ""Julie"" -I started to appreciate Julie’s elegance, the grace in how she rejected all her parents’ hopeless vulgarity. In how she had ruined her body until it was grotesque as demonstration of the fact that even so, it was beautiful in a place that we couldn’t reach and she could. Did I admire her? I don’t know. I envied her a little. I didn’t want her to be abandoned, but I didn’t want to be her caretaker, either.p68 Horror stories about disability are common; what isn\'t, are stories like this one that are built on empathy for disability.5. ""Night Birds"" -On the shores of this river, all the birds that fly, drink, perch on branches, and disturb siestas with the demonic squawking of the possessed— all those birds were once women.p73 What a great concept! Turns into a story about a character with a ""rotting disease,"" like leprosy. More ableism in this one.6. ""Metamorphosis"" - A piece about identity, the body, and modern medicine from traditional and nontraditional sources.7. ""Hyena Hymns"" -“He talks shit about Argentina nonstop, says stuff like ‘I would understand if my kids left,’‘They can go if they want, they have passports.’” “Eighty percent of Argentines will say the same thing, and then the minute they hear a zamba they’ll start bawling.”p I love stories that explore the meaning of ""home"" and the various attitudes we hold about a place we need so much.8. ""Different Colors Made of Tears"" -I know I can’t say this in public and I certainly shouldn’t feel it, and I know old people have plenty of problems, solitude and meager pensions and cruel children and getting sick and losing their minds, but I just don’t like them— I don’t like old people. I don’t know what I’ll do when I’m old myself: I hope I die before I get there. It’s a strange feeling: I get the sense that they’re faking. That the aches and pains, the plodding steps, the constant chatter about illnesses and doctors, the smell of their skin, the false or decayed teeth, the same anecdotes told and retold— it’s all an act put on to irritate.p109 I thought I knew what this story was going to do with such blatant ageism on part of the narrator, but I was wrong. I\'m not sure at all why it\'s there.9. ""A Suffering Woman"" - A story about sickness, our fear of sickness, and how we are affected emotionally by others\' sickness.10. ""The Refrigerator Cemetery"" - This is definitely my favorite story in the collection. It\'s heartbreaking though, and once ago, there\'s a touch of illness.11. ""A Local Artist"" - Some fascinating art content in this one. Enriquez is excellent with description!12.

Anagrama) nos trae relatos más largos que sus anteriores libros, aunque menos experimentales.En los doce relatos que componen la obra, Enríquez siguió la línea que venía trazando con Las cosas que perdimos en el fuego y Los peligros de fumar en la cama. Tal vez se pueda plantear como una especie de trilogía, si uno es generoso con la autora. De lo contrario, nos encontramos con el descontento, la falta de descubrimiento dentro de su escritura. Los que la leen cada tanto es posible que lleguen a decepcionarse, como volver a la casa embrujada de feria y darte cuenta que los fantasmas aparecen con los mismos disfraces de la última vez.Así y todo, al retomar ciertos tropos y recorrer sendos pasadizos de su universo, esta estrategia puede favorecer al libro a la hora de las ventas. Los fans de Mariana (muchos, muchísimos) van a disfrutar como locos de esta colección, que propone más y más horror a chorros.Hay varios cuentos de Un lugar soleado para gente sombría que utilizan estrategias idénticas con iguales resultados para contar historias bastante similares. Los monstruos continúan siendo los discapacitados/deformados («Un artista local»), los pobres («Cementerio de heladeras», «Ojos negros»), las mujeres desesperadas o perversas («Julie», «La mujer que sufre»), etc, y la sociedad que los convirtió en esa otredad. Profundiza, pero sin encontrar nuevos caminos para hablar de lo mismo.Entre las cualidades para rescatar, están las imágenes brutales, cotidianas y descarnadas al mismo tiempo; Mariana tiene una sensibilidad inigualable para lo macabro, como también para la creación de atmósferas opresivas, espeluznantes, raras o tétricas, según la ocasión.Pero mucho también se puede decir de ciertos vicios que, en algunas ocasiones, entorpecen la lectura. Enríquez insiste por hacer ver que sabe o investigó, embiste con descripciones enciclopédicas la fuente del mal de cada cuento, un hábito de periodista que preferiría editado en la ficción.(Sigan leyendo esta reseña en el siguiente enlace:https://fahrenheit452.com.mx/.../un-l...)'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'A mí nunca me leyeron cuentos cuando chica, tampoco tuve hermanos a los que contarles historias de terror.

Debo decir que tuve suerte, los primeros libros que leí se basaban en conclusiones inesperadas. Que ames o no a Mariana Enríquez viene de ahí.Mariana no es una escritora de finales y su terror no se basa en que te enteres de cuál es el mal.

Es ahí donde comienza y jamás termina una historia (¿qué podría dar más temor que la incertidumbre?)Leí otras reseñas y sí, lo mismo de siempre (¡¿y qué?!).

Si me lo preguntáis, esas ""cosas"" a que se refiere la embaucadora editorial son aburrimiento y la sensación de constante dejá vu.Esta es la segunda antología que leo de la afamada escritora argentina que ha venido a revolucionar el género de terror desde el realismo sucio. Y ahora ya puedo asegurar que yo me bajo definitivamente de este tren. Si lo que más me disgustó de la anterior antología fue que muchos de sus relatos daban en inacabados, que quedaban como una ristra de anécdotas siniestras a las que le faltaba un remate o directamente la estructura formal de un cuento, en ésta me parece haber leído el mismo relato una y otra vez, como si a los mismos personajes les hubieran acechado distintos entes sobrenaturales. Aunque también hay unos cuantos que se quedan en anécdotas, como ya me pasara en Las cosas que perdimos en el fuego.Y es que no solo Enríquez, sino todas las narradoras hispanoamericanas con la pretensión de describir la sociedad y el día a día de sus países me parecen muy repetitivas. En estos relatos, al igual que en los de, por ejemplo, María Fernanda Ampuero, todos los padres están ausentes, todas las madres son alcohólicas, todos los hijos indiferentes, todos los maridos maltratadores y/o condescendientes y, por supuestos, todos los protagonistas están deprimidos o anestesiados por la medicación. Ni en Argentina ni en Ecuador hay lugar para la alegría ni recuerdo de la infancia que no se rememore con sórdida nostalgia. Claro que para hacer terror hay que enfangarse y describir el lado más oscuro de la humanidad, y muy seguramente para Enríquez los fantasmas, vampiros o demonios de la mente sean añadidos estéticos que salpimientan una crítica social; lo que no hace falta es hacerlo siempre desde la misma perspectiva. Lo terrorífico puede aparecer tambien durante un picnic, con el encontronazo en mitad del bosque con un bebe con los dientes perfectamente formados. Luego puedes decir que ese bosque había sido utilizado desde remoto por curanderas para deshacerse de los abortos de las ricas familias hacendadas de, yo que sé, Lomas de Zamora. Pero no es necesario recrearse constantemente en lo sucio y miserable para construir una historia de terror. Y no malinterpreten esta queja como pacateria; esto no es la crítica de un pusilánime que despacha un libro como abominable porque hayan matado a un perro, sino la de un lector hastiado de leer siempre las mismas historias.La antología reúne los siguientes relatos:Mis muertos tristes (****):en un barrio pobre de Buenos Aires, donde la delincuencia tiene en guerra a todos los vecinos, los fantasmas de los muertos comienzan a manifestarse para acosar... ¡a los propios vecinos! El mejor relato de la colección pese a los funambulismos intelectuales que hace la protagonista para justificar lo injustificable.Los pájaros de la noche (**):una suerte de semblanza de la infancia de la pintora surrealista Mildred Burton. La narradora, presa de una extraña afección que pudre su carne en vida, habla de su hermana desequilibrada y de como su degeneración mental y física va avanzando con el tiempo.La desgracia en la cara (****):la madre de los protagonistas nunca se recuperó de la violación que sufrió en su juventud por parte de un hombre al que nunca logró ver el rostro. Antes de morir confesará a su hijo que, en realidad, no vio la cara de su violador porque no tenía. Años más tarde, cuando este suceso luctuoso ha quedado en el olvido, la hija sufre una parálisis facial que va evolucionando en algo mucho más siniestro. Muy inquietante.Julie (***):la prima de la protagonista, hija de sus tios pijos que viven en Estados Unidos, se ha convertido en la verguenza de su familia. Obesa mórbida, adormecida por la medicación que la mantiene controlada e hinchada, confiesa que, por las noche, es poseída por fantasmas. Entendiendo posesión de la manera más lúbrica.Metamorfosis (*):a una mujer se le extirpa un mioma uterino y, al verlo, siente una fascinación inexplicable y una necesidad imperiosa porque regrese a su cuerpo. La típica mamarrachada en forma de body horror pedestre.Un lugar soleado para gente sombría (**):la muerte de Elisa Lam fue muy popular en ciertos sectores de internet en 2013, y dio lugar a un buen puñado de videos de YouTube diseccionando un caso del que apenas se sabía nada. Elisa, una joven diagnosticada con bipolaridad, apareció flotando en el interior del tanque de agua que abastecía al hotel en que se alojaba. Cómo llegó allí, fue suicidio o asesinato, qué vio la desorientada Elisa que la obligó a no tomar el ascensor tal como refleja la última grabación que se tiene de ella son respuestas que nadie tiene. Tampoco Enríquez, pues su cuento va sobre una periodista atormentada por la muerte del yonqui de su novio cuya vida se ve ligada a la de Elisa Lam por un reportaje que está realizando sobre su caso.Los himnos de las hienas (**):una pareja acude a visitar un palacete abandonado y allí serán atacados por un extraño hombre.Diferentes colores hechos de lágrimas (***):una empleada de una tienda de ropa vintage acude a una cita con un potencial vendedor, un octogenario rico, que quiere deshacerse de todo el vestuario de su difunta esposa. Cuando las empleadas se prueben los vestidos sentirán como su cuerpo cambia de una manera terrible y sangrienta.La mujer que sufre (**):la protagonista recibe por error un audio en el que una desconocida ofrece sus mejores deseos a una amiga que está pasando por la quimio. Pese a tratar de arreglar el malentendido, los audios se repiten, y pronto la protagonista se obsesionará con esa misteriosa enferma de cáncer.Cementerio de heladeras (**):la protagonista recuerda un episodio de su infancia que ocurrió en el vertedero de neveras en el que jugaban de críos. Allí, saltando y corriendo alrededor de los frigoríficos, pensaron que jugar a Houdini sería una idea bárbara. Sin embargo, cuando uno de los amigos intentó salir del cubículo sufrió un ataque y murió. Los niños, en vez de auxiliarlo o avisar a la policía, lo regresaron a la nevera y lo olvidaron para siempre. Hasta ahora.Un artista local (***):una pareja acude a un pueblo aislado para pasar sus vacaciones. Desde que desviaron la línea de tren el pueblo ha sufrido un largo y doloroso proceso de decadencia que, gracias al recién descubierto turismo rural, parece que está a punto de terminar. Uno de los responsables de este discreto renacer es un pintor local, al que conocerá la pareja, quieran o no.Ojos negros (***):uno noche, unos trabajadores sociales serán acosados por unos extraños niños que les pedirán entrar a su coche. Éstos, al negarse, comprobaran que los niños, de niños, tienen muy poco. Un simpático cuento de vampiros.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Ni un solo cuento reseñable.

Todos mis conocidos me alentaban a leerla: ""Es maravillosa, no lo vas a poder creer, te va a dejar sin palabras"".Admito que no me siento asombrado después de leer este libro. Los relatos no me asustaron y la prosa no me parece excepcional. Es más, creo que varios relatos deberían haber sido más trabajados.Barajo dos posibilidades: que haya entrado con expectativas demasiado altas (después de todo, hay tantas entrevistas, artículos, reseñas elogiosas dando vueltas sobre Enriquez que uno puede creer que va a leer algo que va a cambiar para siempre tu manera de ver las cosas, y eso rara vez sucede) o bien, que no se trate del mejor libro de la autora. A fin de cuentas, todos los autores tienen libros mayores y menores.Como suele suceder cuando mi gusto difiere del de la mayoría, no puedo hacer más que desarrollar los motivos por los cuales el libro no me impresionó tanto. Lo cierto es que la mayoría de los relatos no cumplen su propósito: no me asustaron. Quizás soy insensible, no sé. Pero voy a evaluarlos uno por uno y la nota general del libro será un promedio de todas las notas individuales:-""Mis muertos triste"": el primer relato del volumen es también el más controversial a mi gusto. Tiene lugar en un barrio depauperado del conurbano bonaerense, que si bien nunca es nombrado, el lector argentino podrá identificar sin problemas con La Matanza, Moreno, Florencio Varela, Quilmes, Lomas de Zamora... y la lista sigue. Lugares donde la delincuencia campa a sus anchas y periódicamente vemos en las noticias por robos, secuestros, asesinatos, tiroteos, etc. Lugares donde la policía es inoperante o corrupta y suele gobernar el mismo político desde hace 10, 20 o hasta 30 años.El barrio se ve conmocionado, además de la inseguridad, por fantasmas que recrean sus muertes violentas. Para mi sorpresa, los fantasmas no persiguen a los delincuentes que los mataron, ni a los políticos que permitieron que todo se fuera al demonio, sino... ¡a los propios vecinos!Así es: la protagonista del relato es una médica retirada que describe a sus vecinos con desdén, como una turbamulta violenta y fascista que discrimina a los delincuentes y desea lincharlos y destriparlos. La descripción de vecinos asediados por la delincuencia en el conurbano como fascistas me resulta chocante, francamente. Lo habitual en esos barrios es que los vecinos hagan marchas pidiendo más seguridad, no que formen escuadrones de la muerte.Más chocante todavía porque la protagonista parece justificar la delincuencia en una instancia del relato (""Entiendo lo que pasa: cuando la miseria acecha en la forma en que acecha en mi país y en mi ciudad, si hay que recurrir a lo ilegal para sobrevivir, se recurre"", dice) pero no tiene la menor simpatía, respeto, ni siquiera compasión, por sus propios vecinos (afirma, en una declaración despreciativa, que evaden impuestos como todo argentino de clase media). Además, se da a entender en otro tramo del relato que el odio que sienten los vecinos por los delincuentes tiene sus raíces en el racismo: se aclara que los vecinos son descendientes de inmigrantes europeos y los ladrones no.Me produce un poco de irritación que un escritor de clase alta - y digo clase alta porque considerando el barrio donde vive en la capital y el éxito que ha cosechado, no me puedo imaginar que Enriquez sea de clase media o baja - demonice a la clase media que vive en un barrio dominado por el delito. Para que un lector extranjero se haga una idea, es como si un escritor mexicano retratara a los vecinos de un barrio dominado por narcos como fascistas por querer que los narcos se mueran. O decir que los habitantes de una colonia salvadoreña son fascistas por odiar a los pandilleros que les hacen la vida imposible. Al mismo tiempo, entiendo cómo este relato hace la delicia de un crítico de arte progre: plantea la remanida y cliché respuesta de apelar a la solidaridad y no demonizar al otro, al que es distinto (aunque te ponga un revólver en la cabeza). Cómodo de decir en un libro, difícil de hacer en la realidad.Admito que tengo implicaciones personales con esto. En 2019, un familiar cercano que vivía en el conurbano, en una zona no muy diferente a la descripta en el relato, fue asesinado por un grupo de delincuentes, y nunca nadie fue arrestado ni condenado por ese crimen. A estas alturas, sé que quedará en la impunidad. Aclaro que no me convertí en un monstruo fascista, a pesar de ser blanco, ni salí a linchar criminales.Por todo lo anterior-y porque repito, la aparición de unos fantasmas en un barrio así no asusta, lo que asusta es salir de casa cada mañana-le doy una sola estrella al relato.-""Los pájaros de la noche"": una estrella porque lisa y llanamente no entendí la historia. Si ustedes la entendieron, por favor explíquenmela.-""La desgracia en la cara"": aquí mejora el volumen. Un relato que creo que podría hacer referencia a las enfermedades hereditarias. Cuatro estrellas.-""Julie"": éste sí que está bueno, en particular por la ambiguedad en torno al personaje de Julie. ¿De verdad está loca, o sus afirmaciones son ciertas? Cinco estrellas.-""Metamorfosis"": una protagonista arrogante hace que le reinserten un bulto que se había extirpado del cuerpo. No sé cuál es la metáfora, pero si la hay, no la capté. Solo porque un personaje está perturbado, no significa que el relato sea perturbador. No me impresionó para nada. Una estrella.-""Un lugar soleado para gente sombría"": otro relato que no comprendo y tampoco me impresiona. La protagonista viaja a USA para cubrir la historia real de una chica que apareció muerta en un hotel tenebroso. Pero principalmente pareciera que se propone retratar a los ejércitos de drogadictos en las calles. ¿Tenía que irse a USA para eso? Aquí en Buenos Aires tenemos muchos. Una estrella.-""Los himnos de las hienas"": aquí de nuevo mejora el ritmo. El relato se merece cuatro estrellas.-""Diferentes colores hechos de lágrimas"": el relato tiene una interesante premisa, pero se desinfla un poco al final. Creo que le corresponden tres estrellas.-""La mujer que sufre"": de nuevo, mi principal crítica radica en que no es un relato de terror. No asusta para nada. Tres estrellas.-""Cementerio de heladeras"": este relato está mejor. Cuatro estrellas.-""Un artista local"": el planteo es interesante. Una pareja decide salir de vacaciones de la ciudad unos días y alojarse en un pueblo perdido en medio de la nada. La premisa daba para mucho, pero no se explica nada al final. Lisa y llanamente, no entendí la conclusión. Dos estrellas.-""Ojos negros"": el relato que cierra la colección adolece de los mismos defectos que el resto. No se entienden muchas cosas, no sabemos qué es el mal que persigue a los personajes, porqué los persigue, no entendemos casi nada. Con un poco más de desarrollo, hubiera sido mejor. Pero no lo tuvo. Tres estrellas.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '2.0⭐️Well shit, this was a hot mess. . . I can’t believe I’m leaving Mariana Enriquez such a poor review but she earned it with A Sunny Place for Shady People. It hurts tho because I was SO EXCITED for this latest collection. I’ve read all of her published works and was a huge fan. Her novel, Our Share of Night, is one of my top reads of the year. So needless to say, I’m really disappointed by some of the content in this book, enough so that it’s tainted the entire release for me.First thing I’ll address is Enriquez’s insensitive use of the very real death of Elisa Lam in the titular story. I think it’s distasteful and exploitive. Although Lam’s death was ruled accidental, many suspect she was the victim of foul-play. Incorporating her untimely demise into a short story shows poor taste and judgement in my opinion.The fourth story, Julie, is offensively fat phobic and vitriolic. Enriquez repeatedly perpetuates the stereotype that all fat bodies are inherently unhealthy and less-than. As someone who often writes about social injustice and inequality, her inclusion of these tone-deaf stories were all the more surprising and disheartening.'}, {'rating': None, 'content': 'PATREON BOOK CLUB FOR OCTOBER FINISHED!'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Va in crescendo este libro; relatos cada vez más aterradores, algunos muy giallo o peli de terror de los 80.

Esos temores se acrecentaron al leer los primeros relatos del libro, seguramente los más flojos, pero menos mal que la cosa remontó y a partir de ahí Mariana desplegó su arsenal haciendo lo que mejor sabe hacer: mezclar leyendas, folklore, creepypastas y fantasmas en unos relatos tan originales como los de sus primeros libros.De los cuentos del libro destacaría:La desgracia en la cara(***): Una chica aquejada de una extraña enfermedad que le deforma la cara vive con su guapa hermana.

Unas viejas les invitan a conocer al pintor y saciar su curiosidad.Diferentes colores hechos de lágrimas(****): Un título muy giallo para una historia donde unas jóvenes compran unos vestidos a un viejo viudo. Los vestidos pertenecieron a su esposa y al ponerselos las jóvenes sufrirán un espanto. Genial.Los himnos de las Hienas(*****): Uno de los mejores relatos del libro. Ambiente genial y toques gore para una historia que me recordó a Clive Barker.Un Lugar Oscuro para gente Sombría(*****): Reinterpretación del caso de Elisa Lam y su extraña muerte en el hotel Cecil. Había visto el vídeo y la historia ya me flipó solo de recordarlo. Un extraño caso de posesión.Cementerio de heladeras(***): Una chica recuerda los hechos que ocurrieron cuando jugaba de niña en un cementerio de neveras a encerrarse en ellas con otros niños. Final impactante.Ojos negros(*****): El mejor relato del libro. Si te va la leyenda de los niños con los los ojos negros te encantará. Molaría una novela con esta base.Solo un pero puedo poner a estos relatos: a veces se quedan cortos, no tienen un buen remate y creo que darían para novelas pero bueno ya saben que opino de la novela de Mariana. No sé si es que ella ha establecido este estilo como su modus operandi y debemos aceptarlo así.Me sucede como cuando leía a Raymon Carver y veía esos cuentos cortos de una trama absorbente y un final que siempre tenía que rellenar yo.Espero que la autora sea capaz de darnos una novela tan escalofriante como estos magníficos relatos algún día. De momento me quedaré con estos tres libros maravillosos de cuentos que la han puesto en el mapa.'}]"

The Silent Patient
",Alex Michaelides,4.18,2590881,1742,"Thriller, Mystery, Fiction, Mystery Thriller, Suspense, Crime, Psychological Thriller",336,05-02-2019,"Alicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect. A famous painter married to an in-demand fashion photographer, she lives in a grand house with big windows overlooking a park in one of London’s most desirable areas. One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word.Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The price of her art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and spotlight at the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London.Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a twisting path into his own motivations—a search for the truth that threatens to consume him....The Silent Patientis a shocking psychological thriller of a woman’s act of violence against her husband—and of the therapist obsessed with uncovering her motive.","[{'rating': 1, 'content': '| |blog|tumblr|ko-fi| |“Please don’t let’s get dramatic.”I\'ve been a bithesitantabout writing this review since the majority of readers really enjoyed this debut. Howeversince Goodreads allows us toexpressandrespectour different opinions I don\'t see any harm in being honest.I didn\'t hateThe Silent Patientbut I did find thisnovelboth ridiculous and incompetent.Just becauseThe Silent Patienthas a ""twist"" that doesn\'t mean it should be labelled as being a psychological thriller. There is little to no suspense, the mystery is laughable, the tension largely MIA. Thepsychologyin this one is...well,the depiction of psychiatrist and psychotherapists is at best, laughable, at worst, ignorant.The book hinges completely on its ""twist"", a twist thatalso renders the majority of the narrativecompletely irrelevant.This book seems to meyet anotherweak attempt of jumping on the domestic thriller bandwagon.In short:Calling this a novel seems somewhat misleading. This reads more like some sort ofhackneyedscript.LONG REVIEW AHEAD (if you enjoyed this book I advise you to skip this rant-review)The Silent Patientis a really flawed piece of work. I will try to tackle what I personally thought were the major problems this book had (and yes, this is my subjective opinion):✎THE WRITING(idiotic dialogues + inane monologues + ham-handed metamorphoses + a complete lack of a sense of place)✖ I likeAgatha Christieand she has what I would call a \'dry\' style of writing. Her mysteries are heavy on dialogue. The many conversations that her characters have are witty, amusing and or entertaining. The descriptions she provides perfectly render the characters\' mannerisms and surroundings.Michaelides\' writing mostly consisted in a series of dialogues between two characters and itreads like a script. It would work if what they spoke like actual peoplerather than this:“Perhaps I’m imagining it.But I’m sensing something… Keep an eye on it. Any aggression or competitiveness interferes with the work.You two need to work with each other, not against each other.”“But remember, with greater feeling comes greater danger.”The dialogues/monologuescame across as being incredibly silly and they make the characters sound like children.✖ There wereplenty of dramatic and over-the-top statements and or phrases that really ruinedpotentiallysignificant scenesand or somber moments of contemplation:“Her silence was like a mirror—reflecting yourself back at you.”~“Now I saw the truth.[She] hadn’t saved me—she wasn’t capable of saving anyone. She was no heroine to be admired—just a frightened, fucked-up girl, a cheating liar. This whole mythology ofusthat I had built up […] now collapsed in seconds—like a house of cards in a gust of wind.”~“How was this possible?Had she been acting the whole time? Had she ever loved me?”~“Why did she do it? How could she?”Jeez, melodramatic much?✖ Theo’s narrative was filled withpainfully overdone monologuesthat have little purpose since they don’t make Theo into a realistic and nuanced character and most of the time they do not even further the plot. Alicia’s narrative (that is, her diary) makes no sense but more on that when I tackle her character. It’s safe to say that, given that her diary entries included things such as “It took me a moment to speak. I was so taken aback I didn’t know what to say” and “I feel joyous. I feel full of hope”, I had a hard time ‘immersing’ myself or ‘buying’ into her narrative.Since this book is a ‘domestic thriller’ both Theo and Alicia don’t have sex they ‘fuck’. Because writing ‘we fucked’ makes the story gritty and ‘dark’ [insert laughter here].✖The Greek ‘connection’.Done properly, I usually love it when contemporary books draw parallels from Greek myths and or classics.Done properly.Comparing people to Greek statues and having your main characters referring to themselves as being a ‘Greek hero/heroine’ is the opposite of subtle:“She was a statue; a Greek goddess come to life in my hands.” ~ “He looked like a Greek statue” ~ “the actress playing Alcestis looked like a Greek statue” ~ “my fate was already decided—like in a Greek tragedy” ~ “Casting herself as a tragic heroine”.We have Diomedes who comes from “a long line of Greek shepherds” (and tells Theo that “every Greek knows his tragedies”). And finally we have Alicia’s painting which is entitled Alcestis.Both the painting and Euripides play hadpotential. They would have been enough.We didn’t need the constant reminder thatThe Silent Patientwants to be a ‘tragic play’. Like many other things in this book,the blatant symbolism managed to ruin a potentially good analogy.✖ These characters donotsound British.They talk like Americans(or what Americans sound like in a CSI episode). There are no British cultural references and or British expressions. This book could be set anywhere.✖ The story is set supposedly in the UK. But really, there is 0 sense of place. Who cares about giving your characters a backdrop? Why bother rendering a neighbourhood or an area of London? Who gives a fork about what a room or place looks like? Let\'s remember: this story could be set anywhere (ornowheregiven how realistic it is).✖ You could say that thefocus on dialogues and flat scenery are reminiscent of a play...which is fine but it doesn’t come across as such.This book just reminds me of a ‘B-movie’ script.There is no tragedy, no pathos , no wit.A 2nd grade play is closer to a \'classic\' play than this book is.✖There is this attempt to make the two ‘main’ women ethereal which did provides a few laughs:“Her white dress glowed ghostlike in the torchlight” ~ “I remember so much white everywhere: […] the white of her eyes, her teeth, her skin. I’d never known that skin could be so luminous, so translucent ; ivory white with occasional blue veins visible just beneath the surface, like threads of color in white marble. She was a statue.” ~ “strands of long red hair falling across bony shoulders, blue veins beneath the translucent skin”.✎THE CHARACTERS✖ Theo. Our wannabeTom Ripley. Within a few pages we know that he is obsessed with Alicia (which makes him incredibly unprofessional) and he for the most part he is justsoooodull and whiny. He moans about his childhood,and his wife, Kathy, who is cheating on him because she is a beautiful actress so...that\'s what they do, isn\'t it?, andhis attempt(s) to self-fashion himself as some sort of tragic hero fail epically. Afterthe big reveal...well. His character makes even less forking sense. He stalked Alicia before breaking into her house. He must have known learnt about her, or made same 2+2 type of reasoning upon learning of her arrest. And he must have realised why she kept silent, especially after he reads Alcestis.This guy issoooothick.Hisdramatic monologues, constant whinging, and complete lack of awareness(I\'ve said it before this man is thick) made him into a really unbelievable character.✖Alicia...she is beautiful.She loves having sex with her husband and painting. That’s about it. We are told that she was ‘charming’...buthow can she have gained this reputation since she has 0 friendsand her only real relationship is the one she has with Gabriel (her partner or whatever). Jean-Felix is the owner of a gallery but they don’t spend time together or are on friendly terms.Who is she charming to?She is a complete recluse! She lives in London and is good enough painter and yet...she has managed to make 0 connections.Her diary entries make her sound at best guileless and at worst like adementedchild. Her character is just an object.She is there to look beautiful and tragic.She has a fewbasic reactions(she just “looks up” or “looks down”) or she doesthe good ol’ ‘banshee’ act, flinging herself in a sudden ‘rage’ towards Theo or another patient. Wow. Such a deep and complex portrait of abetrayed and traumatised woman.✖The cast of characters consists in cardboard cutouts. Going back to Christie, sometimes exaggerated character can be entertaining. Especially if they are a parodying a certain type of person (the writer, the artist, the gossipy old lady and so forth). Here we have mere ‘sketches’ of people.We have Christian, who doesn’t like Theo because he is amassive bellendbully: “Christian glared at me.” “Christian looked irritated.” “Christian rolled his eyes at me.” “Christian laughed that annoying laugh of his.”We haveProfessor Diomedes who is Greek and is “an unorthodox man’...that’s it folks. That’s his character. Also,I cannot seriously believe that he was so unprofessional and blind about Theo (and his flagrant obsession with Alicia).Yuri is another pointless and unbelievable addition to the story.He is the head psychiatric nurse and comes from Latvia so heobviouslyhas to be weird about women.Makes perfect sense. Then we have Stephanie who has very little page time or importanceTheo having never even know of her existence knows immediately, before she even speaks, that she is Caribbean). We also have the “jolly Caribbean dinner ladies” (who,surprise surprise, are only mentionedonce).We have a few‘ugly’characters who are either ‘mad’ and or violent(Elif, a ‘massive’ Turkish woman, who spends her time shouting or grunting because she is a patient and that’s how ‘ugly’ and mentally ill people behave.Lydia, Alicia’s mean aunt. She is grotesquely ‘fat’ and has lots of cats. She basically just glares, scorns, and spits at people). Paul, Alicia’s cousin, still lives with his mother so he looks like ‘virgin’ and in spite his size he seems ‘stunted’. Kathy and Gabriel arethe antithesis of credible(actors and fashion photographers manage to be self-engrossed and 1 dimensional). We have Gabriel’s brother...who is the typical chip-on-my-shoulder character (he has acne, he is balding, he is just a ‘lawyer’,boohoo). Jean-Felix owns a gallery so he is the embodiment ofsome sort of art-vampire.✎THE NONSENSICAL PLOT✖ Nothing much happens. It’s quite clear thatthe words that exist before the ‘twist’ serve as filler. Theo moans about this and that. That\'s about 70% of the novel.✖ There area series of stupid thingshappening forno apparent reason.such as Paul hitting Theo with a bat. WHY.✖ The Grove is not a forensic unit. I am sure that Theo should be doing a bit of paperwork to cover his 1 to 1s with Alicia. And everything thathappens in the Grove is extremely unlikely. Rules, guidelines, procedures are flung out of the window.✖ The ‘big twist’is predictable.We know Theo is unreliable.All of his actions towards Alicia, his research and his ‘interviews’ makeno bloody sense. He already knows about her! And unlesshe is incredibly thick, he should do 2+2 and figure out why she isn’t talking. The twist makes his motivations and approach to Alicia completely pointless. Theo hadn’t forgotten what he’d done, and his narrative isn’t in the format of a diary, where he would be deliberately lying and omitting certain things. Why not make this novel into more of a confessional? Or more in the vein ofThe Talented Mr. Ripley,You,Lolita, or evenGentlemen and Players, where we know early on what he has done and we wonder if he will be caught or if he will done something worse.IN CONCLUSIONThe Silent Patientmight notbe the worst novel I’ve read but it’sa badly written, poorly developed book. Worse still,The Silent Patientcomes across as being both pointless and passionless.A ‘twist’ needs—demands—a story. I want to read characters who vaguely resemble or talk like real people. If you want to play with stereotypes (a la Christie) don\'t make yourcharacters take themselves so seriously.A parody of a certain \'personality\' should at least be funny and or amusing.Adding a strong setting and a coherent storyline wouldn’t do any harm either.Overall:The Silent Patientis a messy, flat, painfully dull, \'Hollywood-type\' of book.Read more reviews on my blogIf you likedVerity,An Anonymous Girl,The Last Time I Liedor the unintentionally hilariousJane Doe...chances are you will likeThe Silent Patient.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'This book starts off really strong with a great premise - intriguing and mysterious right away - the writing is even pretty strong in the beginning, but somewhere along the way it all seemed to fall apart for me. I felt like the author was so determined to deliver the big ‘twist’ that he lost sight of the actual plot. It just gets so convoluted and meandering, and I couldn’t really follow what actually happened, from what was meant to be the lies and fantasy of some characters. The author also spends an awful lot of the book having the main character, Theo, ‘investigate’ Alicia’s family members - the cousin, the aunt, the brother in law, her gallery manager - and each of them is made to seem weird, untrustworthy and in some cases outright creepy - but all of it ends up just feeling like a cheap trick, because nothing comes of any of them. Like, for example, the plot about the brother in law assaulting her, or the cousin borrowing money, - none of those things are resolved and it just feels like a lazy way for the author to point our suspicions in the wrong direction while leaving frustrating loose ends everywhere. I mean, you can make any character seem suspicious and create false suspense very easily if you have no obligation to deliver any resolutions.In the author’s single quest to deliver the big ‘twist’ he also left big holes in the plot and expected us to overlook implausible things... like, one small but obvious thing - at the start of the book Theo’s belongings are searched by ‘security’ before entering the hospital and he is specifically told he can’t have any lighters for “obvious reasons” - can’t have any of the psychiatric patients getting their hands on a way to start fires - (now the author didn’t need to mention this in the story - he could have lost this scene and not drawn attention to the fact that Theo was not allowed to bring in a lighter - not sure why it was even a point??) but then through out the book the characters smoke cigars and cigarettes in the hospital ... how do they light them?? They all carry matches I assume? Are matches any less likely to start a fire??! There were SO MANY eye-rolling moments through out the book like that one, and far worse. So many times we, as readers, were expected to buy into implausible actions by characters (like Alicia’s cousin beating Theo over the head with a baseball bat and knocking him out because he thought he was an intruder (in his yard - not even his house!), and then not to mention Theo feeling fine and not needing any medical attention??) or just overlook unbelievable scenarios - like Theo following his wife’s lover for miles and never once actually seeing his face?? When the police investigate the scene of Alicia’s husband’s death, how do they not find the rope and wire that was used to tie up Alicia? And Who has enough rope and wire just lying around in their house to tie up two adults anyway?! And another doozy - Theo injects Alicia with enough morphine to put her in a coma for the rest of her life, but she has time to find a pen and diary and write a very lucid, long entry explaining Theo’s role in everything?! Besides the fact that she would be completely out of it and totally incapable of writing, even if she could, why wouldn’t she, I don’t know, go get help because you’ve just been injected with a lethal dose of morphine, instead of writing a short story??! And then with a lethal amount of morphine coursing through her blood stream she takes the time to hide her diary in a picture frame?! Seriously?! It’s almost funny.And what about Alicia’s silence?? The mystery at the heart of the book - in the very title itself. The big reveal, the big answer shrouded in suspense and mystery .... the reason she didn’t talk was because she felt she had nothing to say??? Because she felt like she was dead too?? Wait... what? Seriously? She’s been accused of murdering her husband, while the man who stalks her, breaks in to her home, ties her up and threatens to kill her later shows up as her therapist, while she allows her other therapist to continue drugging her with “horse dosage” amounts of sedatives - but oh well, silence for years and years because she felt dead and had nothing to say?? And she stays silent mind you, while she still manages to hide her diary?!? We can only assume she goes to extreme measures to keep the police from ever finding it? Even though they walk in right after the murder while she’s still holding the smoking gun - I guess they gave her time to gather her things and somehow hide a diary down her pants while she was brought to prison?? Not to mention how no one found it when she was transferred to the mental hospital?! Why go to so much trouble to hide a diary if you feel like you’re dead and you have nothing to say!?Giant eye roll.I’m sorry - this book just asks too much of the reader - this ‘twist’ has been done many times before and it only works (and still very poorly) if you overlook all the giant plot holes and ridiculous scenarios.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""This is easily one of the best mystery/thrillers, if notthebest, I have ever read.Alicia shoots her beloved husband in the face five times, then never speaks another word. Theo, a psychotherapist, is captivated by Alicia's story and wants to help her. He thinks he can get her to speak again and divulge why she killed her husband. What follows is a search for truth in what really happened between Alicia and her husband.First of all, if you haven't read this book yet, you absolutely should. And you should stop reading my review and any other reviews/blurbs/thoughts about this book until you do. Because while I always strive to make my reviews 100% spoiler-free (this one included), there's something to be said for expectations. And there's no way reading anything about this book wouldn't sway your expectations.I made the mistake, after reading this book and loving it, of not only recommending it to a friend, but also talking up how much this book amazed me, how great the reveals were, yada yada yada. And so when she read it, she had built up an inkling of something to come and anticipated it, hence losing the element of surprise. So I inadvertently committed the biggest book faux-paus ever and ruined a fantastic book for a friend. It's something I regret to this day. (Elaine, if you're reading this, I'm so sorry!)I certainly don't want to do that again. So yeah, I'm warning you. Last chance to turn back if you haven't read this book.Okay, now that I'm among only those who are in the know, I feel like I can freely gush. How amazing was that reveal?! I usually have terrible book memory, but I'm certain I will remember that reveal for the rest of my life. It wasn't just what it was, but also how it was executed. Not only did I not see the twist coming, but I was so surprised I stared open-mouthed at my book and reread it multiple times to make sure my brain could comprehend the complete mind bend of what I had just experienced.But to simplify this story down to just its reveal feels like an injustice. At its heart, this is a confounding murder mystery and it includes all of the requisite parts—clues, suspicious persons, and red herrings. We are directed one way, then another. But like any great mystery, the real magic is in its sleight of hand. While we are focused on one thing, really something else is going on altogether. And at the end, we can only wonder at the sheer audacity of what it takes to pull off such a magical feat.The story grabbed me from the very beginning with an intensity that didn't let go. Once I started, I couldn't put it down. I was turning the pages as fast as I could, immersed in the experience and loving every moment. It only took me a few hours to get through the whole thing, and at the end my head was definitely left spinning in the best way possible.Recently, I read it again. I wanted to see if the magic of the first time is still there or if, now knowing the twists, the story would feel lesser than. And I'm so happy to report that I loved it just as much the second time around. Now, instead of having to pay attention to the plot, I could really focus on how masterfully Alex Michaelides built up the mystery and its reveal. And it really is something to marvel at.I have to say, books of this genre are always billed as astounding and surprising when most of the time they just feel contrived and silly with no payoff at the end. But wow, does this book deliver! It's so darn satisfying to read such a compulsively addicting story, with twists done right that left me absolutely speechless.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:The MaidensThe Fury~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧This was a pick for my Book of the Month box. Get your first book for $5here.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'CONGRATULATIONS-Goodreads Choice Awards Mystery & Thriller Winner!I feel like I should preface my review by stating that I have read A LOT of psychological thrillers, and coupling that with the fact that this was my most anticipated read of 2019 gaveThe Silent Patienta great deal of pressure. This will still be an overall positive review, but I felt I had to include some honest thoughts here as well for those readers who may need their expectations in line like I clearly did.The premise here is simply incredible; we have a woman named Alicia Berenson who is accused of murdering her husband and proceeds to clam up and keep quiet for the following six years, living during this time in a mental care facility called The Grove for highly dangerous folks. Enter Theo Faber, psychotherapist extraordinaire and flawed individual. He already has a respectable job elsewhere, but decides to transfer over to The Grove, even though it is a sinking ship, because he is obsessed with Alicia and solving the mystery behind why she murdered her husband. Along the way, we get snippets into Alicia\'s diary leading up to the murder, alongside of Theo\'s POV.I can\'t really give you anything more than this, because this is a novel that depends on you being fooled by the twist. You know, the big twist, the one where every blurb on the cover and every early review gives you a heads up, and perhaps that was part of the issue here for me. It seems these types of books that pull the wool over your eyes and take you by surprise are best enjoyed before anyone else has had a chance to read them. Let\'s come back around to the fact that I\'ve been reading mysteries, thrillers, and suspense novels for decades, way beforeGone Girlwas written and these domestic dramas with tricky slight-of-hand became all the rage. If you are new-ish to the psych thriller scene, and you whole heartedly enjoyed recent novels such asThe Woman In The Window, you will adore this. It was a well written, compulsive, slow burning build up to an explosive ending. Structurally, it had everything you could ask for, as it was well researched, engaging, and the perfect length of ""includes what we need without being overly winded"".Unfortunately, I\'ve seen this particular twist done numerous times, so I was clued in fairly early to what the big twist would be, and without spoiling or giving anything away, the lay out of the narrative in the second half of the novel is what fully clued me in, because it was too neat and tidy to end any other way. I will say that I was so satisfied and pleased with the way the author chose to close out the final chapter, and regardless of being surprised by the twist or not, it was a classic wrap up that will stand the test of time over the years.I think I\'m going to wrap it up here, and please don\'t let my 3 star rating dissuade you from giving this one a try. Michaelides is talented, and his writing is gripping and keeps you turning the pages regardless of the big twist. I would be honored to read his next novel and will most certainly look for his name in the future. In the meantime I have found so much in this novel worth discussing, from the portrayal of mental health care to the inner workings of various marriages, and think this will make a great winter book club choice for readers around the globe.*Many thanks to the publisher for providing my review copy via NetGalley.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Read anything else on your TBR first. Anything. Better yet, delete The Silent Patient from your TBR. If you do, you\'ll never know what it feels like to become aware that you could have spent that 4 - 5 hours reading a great book ... or at least a better book.... definitely a book that doesn\'t do a major disservice to anyone who practices in the mental health field or who lives with a mental health impairment, and maybe even a book that doesn\'t present misogyny on every page.The Silent Patient fails as a psychological thriller on all fronts. Its narrator lacks any credibility as a psychotherapist, as an employee, as a spouse, as a man. All characters are flat and inauthentic. The plot doesn\'t hang together. The solution telegraphs itself long before the ending, and still makes no sense. Michaelides wastes time on sub-plots that are irrelevant, introduces red herring characters with no subtlety so the reader is merely annoyed. Offers us a lawyer who is instantly available more than once to meet with someone he seeks not to meet., and a therapist who sees a former (long..... former, like .... years) patient at her home at 10 pm, and then risks malpractice by offering advice to him. And the writing is pedestrian, at best.Aside from its flaws as a psychological thriller, Michaelides demonstrates that he knows nothing about mental health diagnoses, treatments and indicated medications, but the biases he displays in this novel contribute to a culture of misinformation that may discourage a reader who needs treatment for therapy from getting it, and may discourage other readers from complying with a treatment plan that includes prescription medications in amounts that data shows have therapeutic benefits. The girlfriend, then wife, of the narrator, describes herself as ""crazy"" a dozen or so times, and yet this is not relevant to any sort of mental health diagnosis over the span of the novel. In a span of ten pages, he describes a character as being in ""a medicated haze"", but the med he names wouldn\'t cause that effect at any dosage. One psychotherapist meets with a patient 2 - 3 times and instead of evidencing any interest in the health of the patient, he primarily focuses on how her behavior might be disturbing her spouse. Another psychotherapist agrees to change a patient\'s prescription med mix on a whim, and overnight, without any plan for a gradual step-down or other concern for patient impact. A third character presses unidentified meds into a patient\'s hand and requires that she consume them in his/her presence. None of the medical professionals, save the one risking malpractice, demonstrate competency or concern for the welfare of their patients.All of the male characters running this facility repeatedly refer to all of the female patients as ""bitch;"" all of the patients in the facility are women. Every female character displays unpleasant behaviors that range in consequence from minor to severe: unfaithful, gossip-y, violent, vengeful, insecure, impulsive, annoying, tiresome, disloyal.I\'ve written a review of this horrid novel only because I might spare a friend or two.

I just happened to see it hanging around in the new releases, took a quick peek, and thought-- why not? Well, I\'ll tell you why not. You absolutely definitely should NOT read this book if you want to go to sleep and get up for real life stuff in the morning. I read this until my eyes were like ""nope"" and closed on their own.It\'s very compelling. A psychotherapist called Theo Faber narrates the story and he announces early on that he\'s pretty ""fucked up"". He worms his way into a new job at the Grove mental health facility because of his fascination with the artist Alicia Berenson, who murdered her husband in an open-and-shut case and hasn\'t spoken a word since.But let us not forget that while Alicia Berenson may be a murderer, she was also an artist.Theo finds himself connecting with Alicia and feeling a desperate need to figure out why she did it. And, what\'s more, he wants to figure out why she is silent. What can\'t she say? What won\'t she say? The more he digs into her life, her family, and her past, the deeper in he gets.It\'s a fast-paced ride with short punchy chapters (oh, how easy it is to think ""just one more chapter""). The story has so many threads and little surprises to uncover. More questions arise at every turn. And even those who work out the main aspect of the mystery will probably still enjoy the journey of finding out why, and all the little shocking discoveries made along the way.It is true that those who have read a number of twisty mysteries will likely guess the truth, but I think there\'s enough goodness here to make it enjoyable anyway.

Theo Farber, a psychotherapist, has heard of Alicia over the years through the news and is delighted when a job opening becomes available that would allow him to work directly with Alicia. Will Theo get Alicia talking again? What actually happened all those years ago?Yes, this book really is as good as all of the hype. The writing on this was really top rate. Michaelides knew perfectly how to create intrigue and how to use dialogue with varying short and long paragraphs and short and long chapters to create the perfect pacing for this work. It was incredibly page turning, and the author definitely showed his chops as a mystery writer. He could write a master class in mystery writing. And this is his debut novel! What will Michaelides go from here? Personally, I can hardly wait to find out.Theo is gaining information about what happened in the past, but he is also questioning his own abilities. Can he really get Alicia talking? What are the professional boundaries of a psychotherapist? There was a little bit of internal monologue with Theo, but it wasn't boring or drawn out unnecessarily but raised some deep questions, causing the reader to think beyond just the superficial mystery/thriller. There was also some mention of art and its deeper meaning. It helped to create added depth to this book.Overall, yes, yes, and yes! This book is phenomenal if you haven't read it already!

The women are all tired, cliched stereotypes that often veer into misogyny. For example, Alicia’s aunt is described the first time you meet her as an ugly, old face pressed to a window, and it only gets worse after that because—of course—she’s fat. Her “grotesque” (a word actually used in the book) appearance is apparently a mirror of her evil personality. How creative! The author takes that approach over and over again: young, naturally beautiful women like Alicia and Theo’s wife are worthy of interest, while the female characters Theo can’t find attractive—because they’re ugly, old, large, fat, fake, stupid—are only worth his disdain.Beyond that, the prose was tough to get through. And don’t even get me started on the diary sections, which portray Alicia as a woman who either sits in a coffee shop for hours on end, has sex with her husband, or paints him as Jesus (no, I’m not kidding). The chapters where she couldn’t speak were almost a relief.Overall, the author just seemed more invested in getting to the the clever twist ending than in writing a full-bodied story with women who seem like, you know, actual people.Which is a pity, because that clever twist ending had potential.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5 shining stars!We finally have a winner.

You can sense that the author also works for the big screen.

Many of you might have had such an experience at least once in your lifetime. Well, this book was the one which gave me that feeling.First of all, let me start with what I liked in this book. The writing style of the author is suited for writing a thriller like this. He succeeded in making me glued to the book even after the glaring innuendos that were disparaging to the core kept me exasperated. He worked out the plot twist well. This might be the reason why almost every friend of mine in Goodreads love this book. I must confess now itself that if I was not a Doctor and I didn\'t know how the healthcare system works, I would also have given this book four or five stars.This is a book which won the best book in the thriller section in Goodreads award last year. If you are promoting a book as a psychological thriller, there are two things which the author should be careful about. One is to get the thriller aspect correct, which the author had succeeded, and the second is to get the Psychological aspect right, which is where the aberration lies here.The author had unabashedly mentioned some things about Psychotherapy in which some are true in some rare cases while some have unfortunately gone entirely wrong. The author has no right to generalise about the health sector as a whole based on some scrupulous activities done by some individuals. You can\'t even see such a shady Psychiatric institution in any dystopian world. Mr Michaelides, who is a Cambridge product, had an excellent opportunity to produce one of the best thrillers. Unfortunately, he didn\'t do the adequate research in the psychological aspects needed for this book.There are many mistakes regarding psychotherapy, treatment methods, various disorders, therapy sessions, medical ethics in this book. Initially, Theo, who happens to be a psychotherapist, is strangely saying that his father had a personality disorder which he is mentioning as an illness that went untreated for the duration of his life, which is, in fact, rather absurd. There is no definitive treatment or drug for the management of personality disorders. The only way in which we can manage it is by behavioural modification therapies like the DBT (Dialectical behavioural therapy) and CBT (Cognitive behavioural therapy). I am sharing four pictures here for my friends who are utterly perplexed due to being thrown into the crazy world of complicated medical jargon by the author in this novel bolt out of the blue.The author should have done more research on topics like the transference, countertransference, Borderline personality disorder, Narcissistic personality disorder before writing this book.I remember having an entrancing discussion about this book with one of my friends who is a Psychiatrist in D.C. We concluded that we should not be pedantic about it and leave it alone as just another painfully didactic fiction which came in the disguise of a psychological thriller.It is poignant to see Entertainment Weekly calling it ""an unforgettable — and Hollywood-bound — new thriller"" with ""a mix of Hitchcockian suspense, Agatha Christie plotting, and Greek tragedy."" I heard that the silver screen version of this book is in the pipeline. I humbly request Mr Michaelides, who also happens to be a screenwriter to correct all the flaws in the novel in the upcoming movie.I had the expectations of being enraptured by this book before reading it. But unfortunately, I abhorred this book to such an extent that I curtailed from reading other thrillers for some time. All the other thrillers I might read after this one will be desultory attempts. I am sure that I will recover from this one. I am sad that Alex Michaelides missed a golden opportunity to create a masterpiece.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""The thing about this book is that it’s only the plot twist.The story itself is just leadup to it.

Otherwise this would have been so infuriatingly disappointing I would have had to put the book over my face and take deep calming breaths in the dark for upwards of 45 minutes.All of that is to say that this has a very, very, very slow start, and the writing fell very flat for me.Plus it’s not...theleastwoman-hate-y book I’ve ever read.But we all have our things.Bottom line: Meh.-------------i finished this book 3 days ago. i just didn't have anything to say about it.review to come / 2.5? stars-------------dear book,please be scary.or thrilling.or plot twist-y.or surprising.or something. anything!love, me""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'My thanks to Ben Willis at Orion Publishing Group for sending me a paperback copy of ‘The Silent Patient’ I have given an honest unbiased review in exchange*Alicia Berenson was discovered standing over her husband - he’d been tied to a chair and shot in the face five times.

Maybe I’ve been reading too many thrillers lately. For me to love a thriller all of the characters have to be well developed and intricate to the story, the plot has to be a good one and have more to offer than just the “thrill”, or wow factor at the end of the book. I found the characters to be shallow and the plot seemed to run off in several directions throughout the course of the novel.I should add that a 3* from me means that the book was just an o.k. read for me, not bad but not great enough that I will be thinking of it long after I’ve finished or be recommending it to my friends. Still worth a read :)One thing proved true, this book did have me turning the pages quickly to find out what would happen at the end. However while I was turning these pages quickly, I wasn’t really getting very much out of the story. I felt as though the fact that she wouldn’t speak was the main focus of the book rather than looking into whether she was really guilty or not. I know that she had been tried and found guilty but I had hoped that perhaps the doctors would find other issues worth pursuing regarding her guilt or innocence.There are multiple characters introduced but none of them are really very well described. Dr. Diomedes is the head of the facility and he appoints a new doctor, Theo Faber, who has recently joined the staff to oversee Alicia’s care. She had previously been under the care of another physician but he hadn’t made any progress with her and so it is hoped that this new doctor will help to make her finally speak.The book is narrated by Theo and then later by Alicia as we begin to read her previously hidden diary.The book takes place in “The Grove” a private facility for psychiatric patients. Theo Faber transferred from another facility because he is obsessed with Alicia’s case. We do get to know him through his thoughts about his own marriage to Karen who seems increasingly “busy” and coming home late from rehearsals, she is an actress. This is a storyline that is introduced and somewhat developed and then just left hanging. What really is going on with Theo’s marriage? He seems to be spending all of his time at the facility with Alicia.SPOILER ALERT***Alicia had been a successful artist and Gabriel a photographer of some repute. There really is never any answer to the question of “why”, why would Alicia kill Gabriel. There doesn’t seem to be any evidence that they were unhappy or that Gabriel was unfaithful, there doesn’t seem to have been much research as to why she would kill her husband. She was convicted because she was found at the scene with the gun in her hand, covered in blood because she had slit her wrists in an attempt to kill herself.The twist is a good one but doesn’t come until the last 20 pages or so. I had pretty much figured it out by then but I’m sure it will come as a surprise to many.I would say read it without reading lots of reviews, decide for yourself if it is indeed “the debut novel of the year for 2019” as the publisher has written in the blurb for the book! After the last session that Theo had with Alicia he is writing everything down while it was still fresh in his mind and he states ""As you will see, it\'s an incredible story--of that there is no doubt. Whether you believe it or not is up to you.""I received a copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides is a 2019 Celadon Books publication.When this book first started to garner a little buzz, I initially shied away from it. I am still avoiding psychological thrillers for the most part. However, the reviews were so overwhelmingly positive I relented, adding it to my TBR list. After a lengthy wait at the library, I finally obtained a copy, and dived in with no small amount of cautious optimism. Was it worth the wait? Did it live up to the hype?The set- up is instantly intriguing-Theo Faber, a criminal psychotherapist is oddly obsessed with the well- respected artist, Alicia Berenson, a patient housed in a forensic unit after shooting her husband five times in the face. She hasn’t uttered a word since. Theo sacrifices better and more lucrative opportunities in hopes of becoming her therapist. As he manipulates his way into Alicia’s life, his determination to unlock the secrets of her heart and mind slowly yields a few surprising results. However, all his probing could have a few unforeseen consequences...Anyone who has read a review for this book has, by now, heard about the stunning twist that apparently caught most readers off guard. But, let’s not get too hung up on the twist. In my humble opinion, a mind -blowing twist is a requirement of any and all psychological thrillers. What makes a twist work in the first place is the mystery.Did Alicia kill her husband, as all the evidence suggests? If so, what was her motive? Why hasn’t she uttered a single word in all these years? This is a compelling mystery. Alicia an enigma, to be sure. This is unsettling enough on its own merits.However, the author also examines some hard truths about institutions that rely on funding, which leads to money and power taking precedent over the welfare and health of the patients. Adding in yet another rich layer is the unique and quite interesting mythological parallel woven into the story.It is easy to step into Theo’s narrative as he slowly walks us through Alicia’s past, dropping hints and clues along the way, introducing us to all the possible suspects, while delving into Alicia’s fragile psyche.But, if I am being totally honest, the plot is not all that plausible, and at times the execution warbles. There are some problems within the story, but in my humble opinion, this is how a pure psychological thriller should be presented. The author relies on paranoia and the emotional instability of the characters to build suspense as opposed to grisly, graphic crime scenes. It’s a mind game from start to finish.Now, about that twist-The most important thing to me was that it was singular. No over the top, unnecessary twists added for mere shock value. A good PT doesn’t need more than one, maybe two, depending on the author’s experience or the situation- in my opinion.In this case, the reader is totally blindsided, tapped on the shoulder from behind, by a revelation so shocking, I’ll bet some of you gasped out loud. I know I did! It messed with your head, right? Now THAT’S what I’m talking about!!Of course, after all that buildup and the success of the big plot twist, the ending had to come together, or all was for naught. I was a little concerned for a few minutes, but honestly, the conclusion was the cherry on the cake.The book was worth waiting for, but I am glad I proceeded with caution and kept my expectations in check. The story is not quite strong enough to merit a five -star rating, but I appreciated the pure, traditional understated approach. The author wisely dialed things back, distancing himself from the oversaturated parodies many current psychological thrillers have become. I hope the popularity of this book with inspire more authors to follow this more authentic prototype and restore the psychological thriller back to its former glory.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3 to 3.5 starsI have a few friends that are probably going to wonder why I am not rating this one higher. I did think it was a decent thriller and I can tell why many rate it high. But, it is also easy for me to tell why someone would rate it low. I am just going to hang out pretty close to the middleThe best part of this book was definitely the resolution. The build up to it was okay, but not all that suspenseful to me. There were a few big moments throughout the book, but it was mainly just exposition. Also, I figured out the ""mystery"" early on. This is not me tooting my own horn like I am an amazing detective. It was more like I stumbled on it by accident. About 1/3 to 1/2 of the way in I thought,""wouldn\'t it be interesting if . . ."" and that is exactly what happened!The characters were kind of flat to me. I think part of my opinion on them is tainted by the fact that I just finished another thriller, The Whisper Man. In that one, the characters are much more dynamic and the relationships are much more interesting. Despite some twisting and turning, the relationships here are plain vanilla and a bit predictable.I will stress again, especially because I know that many are rating this one highly, that my criticisms above are just little things that I felt and I know for certain that others won\'t feel at all. So, don\'t read my review and go in thinking it is going to rate middle of the road for you, too. You might be one who really gets into it!Basically, an entertaining thriller. Not too deep.

Solid, but not really exceptional.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Sadly I have read Fifty Shades of Grey, so I cannot call The Silent Patient the absolute worst book ever. Instead I\'ll just call it awful, truly and in all ways, from its portrayal of mental illness, to its utter lack of believability, to its stupid, stupid, stupid characters. One of whom gets an eyeball gouged out and I almost feel like doing the same to myself for having read this thing from start to stupid finish.The story takes place in a mental institution, where most of the psychiatric professionals are presumably tweens and teens. Patients are permitted to wander at will carrying items such as broken cue sticks, which I would think might be a bit jagged and sharp and thereforepotentially quite dangerous, but, what do I know. Theo, the main character-slash-psychotherapist, gets a job at this facility and on his very first day he decides which patient he\'d like to treat. He is not only permitted to treat his choice of patient -- he is also, conveniently, given no other duties aside from trying to get this SILENT PATIENT to speak. I feel like he should have at least had some paperwork, some standard mandatory training modules, something. But no.Anyway, the SILENT PATIENT has been silent for years, ever since murdering her husband, but no one else bothers with her anymore because most of the rest of the staff think she\'s a ""bitch."" Theo, in a true flash of psychiatric brilliance, wonders if perhaps heraggressively drugged stuporis preventing her from talking. Really it\'s a wonder none of the other doctors thought of this. In any case, his boss naturally agrees to reduce the dosage of her medication right away. I am sure that in real mental health facilities this is exactly how it goes.At one point, Theo discovers that one of the staff has been selling opoids to patients. His immediate thought: ""I wondered what else he was up to—perhaps I had been a little too hasty to defend him so determinedly to Stephanie. I’d better keep an eye on him."" YES, Theo, definitely KEEP AN EYE ON HIM. Jesus.In the meantime, Theo decides to harass his patient\'s family and friends to see if they might provide clues as to why she won\'t talk. There is a dramatic scene in which a cousin takes Theo up onto a roof. For no reason. ""This is where we were when we heard her father say the thing he said to make her crazy for the rest of her life,"" or some such nonsense. AHA, it\'s all coming together now!As to why Alicia, the patient, won\'t talk?Well, she\'d just been held captive by a masked man for hours, and when her husband arrived home he suggested that the masked man kill her instead of him, most likely because he didn\'t realize he was in a novel and that such husbands in modern fiction do stand a good chance of being murdered by their fictional wives. For whatever reason, at that point the masked man decided he\'d had enough for one day and left, killing neither of the two. And then Alicia, presumably perturbed at her husband\'s less-than-chivalrous behavior, shot him five times in the face.

Yeah, this was 𝗡𝗢𝗧 that.This book was EVERYTHING. I MEAN 𝑬𝑽𝑬𝑹𝒀𝑻𝑯𝑰𝑵𝑮.I’ve highlighted so much. WAY TOO MUCH 🙆\u200d♀️I read this so slowly because I knew when it would be over I’d be a wreck.

The diversity in this book was amazing to see!There was not a 𝗦𝗜𝗡𝗚𝗟𝗘 dry page. Not one. I drank every damn page like it was my only source of water.This wasn’t the typical third-act conflict type of book. NOPE. It was riddled with ups and downs but you can’t help but feel everything with these characters. It had depth and was plain amazing till the freaking end.

𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐒𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐋 𝐌𝐎𝐌𝐄𝐍𝐓𝐒.They gave me all the feels. The soft touches. Him randomly tucking her hair behind her ear. Her just staring at him bc he’s so damn hot. The forehead kisses.

This man is the most caring, reckless and loving creature that managed to work his way into my soul. He’s so thoughtful and his inner monologue is so funny.

But this book showed the distinction between their thought processes and how they’re actual individuals, not the same brain.Gosh, 𝗔𝗡𝗔𝗦𝗧𝗔𝗦𝗜𝗔 𝗔𝗟𝗟𝗘𝗡 was so relatable. It was so hard seeing her go through all that shit but watching her grow stronger and healthier was so rewarding. I’m so proud of how she dealt with things.I loved how she became amazing friends with the team and cared about them like family. I loved her for saying what she wanted and sticking to it too. I’m so glad she had a spine and stood up for herself when it mattered.I’m genuinely so impressed this is a debut novel and I cannot WAIT to read more from Hannah Grace!!Whew!

I haven’t read something so unentertaining in a long time and only wasted my time for ten long hours.The book was way too long and too much. Too much drama, too much plot, too much was happening. I was half way into it when I already forgot what happened before because it.was.just.to.much, of everything. I wanted to dnf this book 10% into it, because it was so boring, but I never dnf a book before so I wanted to keep going. But it was just awful. I couldn’t wait until I finally (FINALLY) got to the end. (Have to confess I also skipped a few parts, mainly Anastasias chapters, halfway through the book because these awful, boring scenes weren’t bearable anymore after a few hours into it.)Aaron was a walking red flag since his introduction. I didn’t like him for a second (he gave me major bipolar disorder vibes with his mood swings). His character was awful und I didn’t enjoy a second of him being in this book. I understand that he was the main villain, but he shouldn’t have so much scene time. The main part of this book was for me hating him and I couldn’t enjoy anything beside because the next second he was back again and my mood fell. I don’t understand how people could keep up with him for so long, he clearly was a bad person (even if dumb Anastasia says other wise).Sabrine I liked just fine, but it’s doesn’t sit right with me reading about her behaviors while she is representing a muslim girl (or I suspect she is muslim because most of Algerians are), but I don’t know if she is for sure.Beside her there were too many side characters, I can’t even remember everyone who was there and why they were there.It’s shocking but the one person I disliked more than Aaron was Anastasia herself. Her whole character was so so so unlikable for me. Her freak-outs, how bad she treated Nathan even though he was always nice to her. The on, off, cold, hot she gave him and how she only liked him when she was drunk was annoying and irritating. Sometimes she acted like the biggest child and I hate how no one stood up to her and beat her in place, because she was such a mean person sometimes to the people around her (mainly Nathan who she always attacks without even knowing if he done anything wrong). She deserved to end up losing everything she worked towards. These „getting under his skin“ actions were unnecessary and childish. It was not funny at all and I hate Nathan for playing along with her every time she fucked him over again.It’s paradox how she is portrayed as a dominant, strong willed character with everyone else, but she lets Aaron walk over her over and over again till the last 2 chapters.I really hated her for every second she was present in this book more than I hated Aaron.What was Ryan’s purpose? He was a major part for the first half of the book but in the end he wasn’t even mention. Like he didn’t exist and the author just forgot he was there once. But he also is a person I didn‘t like. He was nice and all but he was interested in Olivia, wants more while laying half naked in a bed with another woman ? Kuddling her ? I wouldn’t want to talk to a boy who is seeing other girls beside me, let alone doing sleepovers with his ex-fuck-buddy.The only part of this book I liked was Nathan’s character. He was cute and polite, respectful, a green flag boy the whole time (even when he was mad that is girlfriend was fucked over and blinded by another man, as he should). He was attentive and always courteous. He cared for others more than he cared for himself. He took care of Anastasia, of his team, his sister. He was totally a golden retriever with a heart of gold. I wish he hadn’t ended up with Anastasia. He clearly deserves something so much better than her. Someone who loves him as equal as he loves, and Anastasia’s wasn’t that. She was just awful to him, treats him poorly and didn’t deserve him or his kindness.This one star is for Nathan and Nathan only.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'To sum up my thoughts very quickly… there was too much going on and yet somehow there was also absolutely nothing going on - so out of a weird mix of annoyance and boredom, I DNFd it at 50%But in case your interested in details…I should have realized right away that I wasn’t gonna like this book when I had a really hard time digesting the writing. There was something about it that wasn’t flowing smoothly from the pages into my brain and therefore I was reading it really slowly and found myself putting it down a lot (which is a very bad sign)Then there was also so much info-dumping for all the side characters. It felt like she already pre-planned out a multi book companion series and was trying too hard to get us invested in all of the side characters by giving them each so much detail and page time.We’ve got her best friend (Liv) who’s starting to get with his best friend (Robbie). Her skating partner (Aaron) who’s mentally and emotionally abusive to her (but she doesn’t realize this even though she’s been in therapy for years and supposedly is really good at expressing her thoughts and figuring out how she’s feeling… but okay.) There’s also a bunch of guys from the hockey team that end up becoming a part of this large friend group that’s forming (JJ, Henry, Russ, Bobby + more). Did I forget to mention Robbie? Yea, he’s Anastasia’s fuck buddy at the beginning of the book because she doesn’t have any interest in committing to a relationship because she just wants to focus on her training and skating career…. but it’s okay because early on he ends up starting a relationship with someone that Liv (Anastasia’s best friend) absolutely hates… so now her and Robbie are just best friends who sleep in the same bed together without shirts on sometimes… nbd (🙄)Then there’s Nate. He’s a sweetie and I liked him enough - but not enough to keep reading. Especially because I really didn’t like Anastasia. As for their relationship… I didn’t like that either. It was a-lot of tell and no show - and the few times there was show and they actually had a minute alone with each other, they would just get it on (yawn).As for the actual plotline - there was none. Yup. None — Basically all these characters meet for the first time when they are forced to start sharing an ice rink and that’s basically just a setup for them all to become friends… and then the rest of the story (from what I’ve read) is just watching them do everyday college shit like go to parties and bars and study and go to training and boring things like that.The funny thing is, is that right at the halfway point is when we get the second half of what was mentioned in the synopsis… where Aaron (the abusive skating partner) causes a ton of drama by getting injured and blaming it on Nate - so Nate ends up getting benched for a while and decides to fill in as Anastasia’s new skating partner…. and that’s right around where I gave up on the story.… and I’m just sayin… don’t put something in the synopsis if it’s not gonna happen until midway through - IMO the synopsis should only have information that takes place in the first 50-100 pages… but what do I know?So to sum all that up again… there were too many characters, too much drama, and somehow there was nothing actually going on other than all these people hanging out a bunch and Anastasia getting it on with Nate every time she was drunk and horny.Is it crazy to say that I have so much more I could complain about?? Even after my longest review ever?? It’s fine, I’ll stop myself here… but just know… I had more.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Is this what kids are into nowadays? Am I too ancient, too old, too out of touch with reality to understand what gen Z likes?""stop slapping your balls this loud""""her ass smells so good""""can Lola really hear my balls?""Yes, these are all quotes from this book.Well... there was zero plot. Every single character talked like they were 15 and just found out about sex through giphs on tumblr. And honestly, sex is the only thing they talk about. Every single page. There is nothing but: who\'s hooking up with who, how many kinky things they\'ve done, waking up and training while wasted from the parties they went to the night before, and how loud his balls are against her thighs when they\'re having sex.The FMC has a hardcore/severe eating disorder. AND THERE IS LEGIT A SENTENCE WHERE THEY EXCUSE A GUY KNOCKING SOMEONE UP BY SAYING:oh, it wasn\'t his fault, he doesn\'t know a lot about pregnancy. he\'s a good guy, he\'s just a 25 year old MAN who doesn\'t understand how sex works. so you gotta give him a pass.But yeah, if you want to know what this one is about, it\'s just a wattpad book that hasn\'t been edited. But I guess these are the books that get publisher deals nowadays.There are too many characters that are introduced in a very confusing way. They get yelled at by their coaches every 10 pages and talk about sex and alcohol for the remaining pages. Rinse and repeat. They all end up sharing a rink and spend a lot more time together, yatta, yatta.It\'s not the worst book I have ever read. But... It is written like a Wattpad story. Repetitive, long and childish.

Stupid instalove shit with a self righteous poorly executed “girlboss” mc who’s whole personality is being sassy and shallow but really she’s fighting demons 🥺🥺🥺🥺 SHUT UP and the love interest is somehow even worse at the beginning of the book he’s said to be in love with a girl and wants to marry her but completely forgets she even exists upon meeting Anastasia? By the way “Stassie” is one of the ugliest nicknames I’ve ever heard in my life. Bitch isn’t the Loch Ness monster.SECOND OF ALL the way he’s immediately like “omg I would do anything to hear Stassie’s laugh again 😍” SHUT THE FUXKKKKK UP YOU JUST MET HER PLEASE LIKE it’s actually painful and So Fucking Forced too. They don’t have two molecules of chemistry to rub together. You can tell the author was literally forcing infatuation on Nathan.THIRD OF ALL the plotline is ass. The author is clearly going for an enemies-to-lovers but Anastasia shouldn’t have even been mad at Nathan in the first place because it was over a minuscule predicament that wasn’t even remotely his fault. “I was planning on being mad at you forever” OVER FUCKING WHAT???? Id get it if she didn’t like him because he’s a useless pushover douchebag who’s literally obsessed with her but she doesn’t even gaf about that. It’s just cuz his teammates ex girlfriends boyfriend or some shit, who he has nothing to do with, fucked up their rink.FOURTH OF ALL nobody in this book has any decorum or home training. Why does Anastasia never wear any goddamn underwear to SOCIAL OUTINGS?Nessie went commando to someone’s BIRTHDAY PARTY. And I’m not sure about you but I wouldn’t want my boyfriend sleeping in another woman’s fucking bed because they’re “best friends” *COUGH* RYAN *COUGH*. And these bitches are talking about sex and literally Having sex in Ubers like MANNERS. THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE FUCKING CAR OH MY GOD.And for a final note: just how much I hate this stupid useless couple😊 Nathan saying he won’t fuck Anastasia when she’s drunk and 1) Nessie getting literally offended by him saying no and going back to being a complete self righteous bitch FOR NO REASON (for a modern day “woke” book the word “no” doesn’t seem to mean as much when you “don’t take rejection well”!

I didn't like the heroine because she was presented as someone determined and focused on her career as a figure skater, but all her actions towards that goal made her look childish and annoying for me because of the way she treated those around her, as if they were disposable, and almost as if she was doing them a favor by giving them the time of day, when at the end of the day she was always the one who came back for more because of that feeling of familiarity she didn’t had before.2. There were too many side characters that I couldn't keep track of, and at some points they stole the limelight in this book, while others became more and more annoying with each intervention (Henry please shut up, you stopped being quirky like 20 chapters ago). Also I don't wanna be like that, but I really feel like the author tried too hard to score those rep points while not even using google translate properly.3. And then the plot dragged and dragged, forever and ever, AMEN.

I’m a delight.”my main problem with the main character:she tried too hard to be grumpy.she was also super overdramatic and she swore to hate hockey players bc of a typical stereotype but one interaction and she realizes she starts to like them. the next thing she does is complain bc she was only willing to like henry. it was infuriating and annoying with how she tried hating all the hockey players. her inner dialogue was so hard to put up with because of the way she simply talked. she was WAY too stubborn for my liking and i did not like it at all. i’m so glad she gave up that behavior bc i wouldn’t have been able to stand the book if it continued like that.i thought there were times where i did seem to understand anastasia. she reminded me of monica geller with the way she was described! from her competitive nature to the way she was “compulsively organized”. it’s also clear how she cares a lot about the people she loves. however they differed in many different ways with how “grumpy” she is and her demeanor around new people.a small spoiler for this quote possibly!!“It felt good hearing him make plans for the future, and I could pretend I don’t know why, but denial is useless at this point. Everything he says makes me melt, and half the time I don’t know how to react, so I kiss him, then things escalate, and before I know it, I’m screaming his name and seeing stars.”—this was one of the many examples within this book that shows there’s no plot, it’s justsex driven.overall, this book wasso slow. it might seem fast paced with the events, but it slowly eased into a normal routine of them fucking every other chapter. it becomes so boring to read the same damn thing every time. it throws you off at the beginning just as an excuse to slow down the plot and focus on them doing it. however this book was great with keeping everything consistent. the amount of pages for each chapter stayed relatively the same and they didn’t favor one pov over another!if u saw my reaction while i read this book, you’d be familiar with these quotes.“I swear to God I will leave you in this airport,” Nate grumbles, slapping my ass, laughing when the noise causes an elderly couple to turn around and look at us, making my cheeks blush.”“It’s like he flicks a switch somewhere and suddenly it’s Niagara Falls between my legs.”mid way this book became entertaining. not for the plot, which remainedboring and gave us nothing. but i genuinely laughed out loud bc of how cringy the writing was sometimes & how it gave off wattpad vibes. the writing itself was entertaining. there was so much smut and usually i don’t mind but there was unnecessarily too much in this book. what was the purpose?? i was going to give this book 3 stars at this point. things were looking up and my rating slowly increased. i also liked the banter between the characters! it was pretty enjoyable on my part so there’s thatusually books that bring comfort involve the found family trope, but it’s not as present in this book mainly bc it focuses on friendships between the boys and anastasia, but even then it’s barely talked about there. plus, the main focus was the relationship between nate & anastasia, which in of itself is all abt sex. my favorite part is definitely the cooking lessons that jj and anastasia had together. cutest!!context: literally just gray sweatpants“He’s in a Maple Hills Titans T-shirt and gray sweats, and I hate myself for being a woman swayed by a man in gray sweatpants. Shit. No, there will be no swaying.””Gray, obviously, because Nathan Hawkins is a man who was most definitely written by a woman.”i hate nathan with a burning passion. this is the rare occasion where iWANTEDa third act conflict. i usually hate them butthey needed it!!he was below the bare minimum. i truly have no idea how anastasia put up with him. she likes a man who wears gray sweatpants and claims he is written by a woman. i wear gray sweatpants!! does that make me written by a woman? i would hope so but that’s besides the point.not every person who wears sweatpants immediately makes them written by a woman!spoilers from this point on“You think he’s going to manipulate her into forgiving him and then she won’t need you anymore. You like being needed by her. It makes you feel important. You know Aaron hates you and you think he’s going to keep her away from you. Which just shows you don’t know how strong she is, or truly understand how much she loves you.”“I shouldn’t have to scream that I’m not naïve or being manipulated for Nathan to trust my judgment. I shouldn’t have to beg him to understand that there is a difference between friendship and partnership.”these quotes single handedly ruined this book for me and made me hate nathan.nathan desperately needs therapy.i’m surprised she put up with the attitude that he showed her. i wanted him to be able to work out his feelings on his own so she would never have to put up with a man who cannot communicate his feelings bc communication is key!! instead they got pissed at each other and would put off arguements. then they don’t see each other for a few days and everything is fixed! i do appreciate the boys knocking some sense into him.“There’s a warm, full feeling in my heart when I’m around this team. It’s unfamiliar but familiar at the same time; a contradiction, I know, but so specific that it feels like it was specifically designed for me. It’s the feeling I didn’t know I needed until these guys crashed their way into my life three months ago.”speaking of the boys:i don’t see why people like henry.he made a LOT of backhanded comments to everyone and whether or not he can tell if it’s mean, i’m surprised they put up with him for so long. i do see that he cares for anastasia but from the beginning he was so blunt. there was ONE scene of henry being kind. he wasn’t even funny! he just had no filter and just cannot control his honesty. if he was able to control his honesty, i’d probably like him better.this book was so fast paced for the characters. this all happened within the span of 3 months.3 MONTHS.i get that the idea of the story is supposed to be that they don’t have any miscommunications and have a “healthy” relationship but i’ve found some problems within this situation. they move way too quickly and the way they address it as “we’ve spent so much time together so we’re built different” does not work for me. don’t get me wrong, they had their cute moments but it wasn’t enough to suffice for me.they don’t fight when they’re “frenemies” which i do appreciate but it’s obvious they wanted different things from the beginning. despite nathan knowing what anastasia wanted, they still got jealous whenever one hung out with another person and they didn’t address it. i feel like they sugarcoated everything and it’s clear anastasia doesn’t think on it much simply because she does not know how he feels. i’ve never met a man who’s happy to be her friend rather than upset that she just wants to be friends.here’s where the book gets confusing: they are obviously involved with one another but not exactly in a relationship type way. they don’t even get together until chapter 30. i honestly stopped caring for their relationship bc i was that done with this book. i thought nathan was desperate and i just did not like them together all that much. sure, they can be cute but their whole relationship and personality revolves around fucking one another and when they were away all they would think abt is alone time between them.the supposed “plot” on the back doesn’t happen until mid way. sure, the ice rink breaks as soon as u jump into the book abt 2 chapters in but the second plot point took too long to happen. i wish it would’ve happened sooner to let the book pick up quicker and become shorter. also i loathe aaron in this book. do i really need to talk abt him? i’m pretty sure everyone hates him.i personally would not forgive nathan for what he said at the end. that might just be me being petty but i don’t want to take shit from a man!! i’d deserve better than someone who can’t work out their feelings bc i got my own bullshit to deal with. sometimes i couldn’t see the reasoning behind the things the characters did bc of the way they justified it. sometimes justification works butnot in this case!TW WITHIN THIS BOOK: EATING DISORDERi want to address the eating disorder that is part of the plot within the book but i also don’t want to be insensitive just in case. i just want to say i’m glad it was addressed and talk about! i didn’t like how late they addressed it into the book thoone more thing: i’m convinced them “playing house” is another way of them boning and making it their entire personality for the entirety of a few hours. this book really pushed my limits. it also sounds like something roleplay relatedpre-reviewi had a nightmare i rated this book 5 stars. rtc'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'what in the insta-lovey-wattpad-pick-me-shit-every-trope-in-the-fucking-world did I just read?this review is longer than aaron’s dick yet smaller than his ego.dnf @ chapter 5update:i read wildfire. sometimes i wonder if my lack of brain cells will be my downfall'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Can we take a moment and talk about therealstar of the book?✨Henry✨He was the best character in this whole book, i was practically frothing at the mouth whenever he appeared, I swear if this man was real i would be on my knees.......to propose, get your minds out of the gutter.He literally so cute and rediculously funny, he says what he thinks in the moment and doesn\'t give a damn.For example Nate wanted to talk to Stassie and JJ said lets get some drink (to let them have some alone time) and Henry said why? you have a drink and so do iGod i love that man, and he got like maybe maximum of 20 pages of screen timeLets not forget :"" it was fun staying in Henry\'s room.

It's book one in the Twisted series but can be read as a standalone.","[{'rating': 3, 'content': '2.75 stars✩⋆when i saw that this book has groveling, best friend\'s brother, grumpy/sunshine trope,touch her and i\'ll kill you,i hate everyone but you, a bed-sharing scene, great friend group, and revenge plan (???), i ran so fast and downloaded this real quick. plus, this was being hyped in booktok so might as well read it.i don\'t know why but this book just made me evaluate my life-myself. why do you ask? well,WARNING FOR NON ROMANCE READERS THIS ⤵ QUOTE IS SPICY OK BYE:""And your pussy is mine. Every inch of you belongs to me, and if you ever let another man touch you- he\'ll end up in pieces, and you\'ll end up tied to my bed and fucked in every hole until my name is the only one you remember. Do you understand?""and at first i was likebecause there\'s things you need to know about me when it comes to my taste for irl men:1.i hate bossy men (pls- i\'m bossy enough as it is)2.toxic? i rebuke this negative energy.3.if you threaten to kill someone if they so much as touch me, therapy or 911?4.if you call me questionable nicknames while having sex, BYE ✋and normally, my attitude iswhy do menbut when i read this? i don\'t know myself anymore.i don\'t know what came over me but suddenly i... i um.. that quote above... i LiKe it... so if you know me, no you don\'t.but anyways, going back to the book, i like bothAva(h) andAlex(H) as individual characters. Alex is literally THE definition of a ""fictional character"" because that man is too perfect. basically, he has an IQ of 160, created a software thingy that made him a multimillionaire in high school and became the COO of a real estate agent development or something and has Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory aaand knows Krav Maga AAAND apparently fucks like a porn star? i-that\'s too much perfection ma\'am.i thought Ava and her friend group were also fucking perfect because✧Bridgetis a literal princess (i\'m not joking)✧Julesis jessica rabbit (??) apparently (also, fingers cross for a Jules and Josh book)✧Stellais this influencer who has 400k followers (???)can i be a part of this fictional friend group pls and thx.i thought the romance was cute in the beginning. usually, in a brother\'s best friend book the girl isalwayspining for the guy while the guy plays a martyr act and becomes a ho to ""push"" the girl away even though he has feelings for her. i\'m glad that\'s not the case here and love the fact that Ava was even a little indifferent towards him at first. and honestly? the smut scenes were kinda hot.overall,this is a very chill book. at least for me. though there are sometw (spoilers) // parental deaths, violence, and child abuse-`,✎WHY NOT A HIGHER RATING?➳since uh, when?i really did think the romance and the wholeOperation Emotionthing in the beginning was cute, though, their feelings for one another went from 0 to 100 very fast because Alex really went from not caring that Ava was having a nightmare and acting all cold and ""heartless"" to:""She was mine. She just didn\'t know it yet. I hadn\'t known it myself until I saw her in Colton\'s arms and every instinct raged at me to tear her away. To claim what belonged to me.""i only sensed attraction but i didn\'t get the feeling they were already at the ""she\'s mine, he\'s mine"" stage. one chapter he\'s acting all nonchalant and cold and then in the next he “desires” her and tells us how badly he wants her and i was like bish when? most of the things he talked about in his pov was about his revenge and a little bit of attraction and with ava\'s pov it was all the operation emotion so them having intense feelings for one another felt kinda quick.their banter was cute the scenes were cute but personally it wasn’t enough for me to be convinced with his new macho man personality towards her. there wasn’t enough depth to be honest. like i didnt get the vibes he cared enough for her to call her “his” because even when he saw her having night terrors in the beginning, i got the vibes he didnt care for her that much and still acted like she was a nuisance.➳telling >>> showingwhen they got together after the first time they had sex there was a lot of telling >>> showing of how they are as a couple and that really bugs me because i\'m the type of person who wants to knoweverything. apparently, they went on dates, alex was suddenly making jokes (?), and they talk through the night but because of the 0 to 100 energy and telling >>> showing, I. STILL. DONT. SEE. THEM. DOING. ALL. THAT. like- what do they even talk about?? and because of this, i wasn\'t really convinced with their “love”, i just didnt feel it becausei wantedallthe details of how they are as a couple and we didn\'t really get that. once they have sex, most of the romance were written in the inner monologue and it\'s mainly because the last half focused more on the revenge plot. also, even the the grovelling was telling >>> showing. noo, i need more.➳Viciousreincarnatedno, but everyone is right tho- i can definitely see the Vicious in Alex. he likes fucking classy women, has insomnia, and has a revenge plan that includes the heroine. i see no difference.➳OW dramadon\'t worry, it\'s nothing bad but i just find it icky when Alex says that the OW fucks like a porn star or when he was about to go on a ""date"" with the OW (don\'t worry, Ava ruined his plans) or when the OW says this to Ava\'s face:""Alex doesn’t do either of those things. It’s well known amongst a certain segment of D.C.’s female population. No kissing, no face-to-face contact during sex. But he will take you from behind. Choke and fuck you till you see stars. Call you the filthiest names and treat you like a slut.""and then Ava thinks this is hot. personally, if someone says this to my face about the guy i\'m into, i will dip because that\'s an ick for me (please blame my virgo sun and my high standards). you\'re telling me you\'re gonna fuck your girl the same way you\'ve fucked your past hookups? ew no thx.-`,✎OVERALL THOUGHTSagain, i thought the romance was cute but it was just ok. the first half was full of cute moments but the last half kinda went down with all the telling >>> showing and i was kinda disappointed with the groveling because of this. like- you\'re just gonna describe how Alex has grovelled for a YEAR in just a page? no ma\'am i want to seeeverything. also, i wanted more scenes of them of how they are as a couple because i just don\'t see Alex being all soft towards Ava.i\'m excited for the next book, aka Bridget\'s book tho! i love the whole princess/bodyguard, forbidden trope. plus, her future mans name isRHYS. that name will forever be sacred so this fictional man who has the privilege of being named after that sacred name better live up to my high af standards.»»━━Twisted series━━««#1: twisted love— ava x alex ➳2.75 stars#2:twisted games— bridget x rhys ➳tbr#3:twisted hate— jules x josh ➳tbr#4:twisted lies— stella x christian ➳tbr'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'OH BOYYYYYYY! LET\'S GOOOOOOOOLet me hype myself up before I write this one.Another absurdly overhyped book. Everyone tells me this series is good and the later books are better. I don\'t doubt it. I don\'t think Ana is a bad writer, her writing is tolerable and sometimes even enjoyable.Can\'t say the same thing for her characters.NOTHINGin this book or even it\'s cover are congruent. Ana thought it would be fun to attemptevery single trope in the history of the universewith a single story, so you can\'t really tell if this is a romcom, a dark romance or just a joke.You get brother\'s best friend, neighbor, nightmare tropes, who did this to you, my parents died or tried to kill me, ex psycho boyfriend, billionaire CEO who doesn\'t date, grumpy-sunshine, family members who want to steal your money and not a single one of these were executed properly. I honestly felt like I was watching a Spanish telenovela.However, I HAVE TO MENTION thebesttrope of all. The one that brought tears to my eyes. The""I AM NOT LIKE OTHER GUYS!!!!!""but I will talk exactly like Christian Grey every time I get the chance. (so he kind is like one guy)Alex, our main character. CEO, billionaire, with an IQ of 190, hates beer, he is not scared of anything, not even bears. Won\'t kiss during sex, because he hates intimacy. He hates birthdays because everyone has one. He thinks everyone wants him for his magnificent shlong. He has been controlling his family\'s company since he was 14, because he was always knew he would be CEO one day and his uncle would listen to his 14 YEAR OLD DEMANDS. He also slut shames his own friends.IT IS LIKE I AM READING THE WORST TINDER BIO EVER WRITTEN.But yet quite possible to exist out there somewhere, the bio under some guy named Rey who lives in Florida and is a republican who hates women.He also says people feared him at 11, because his parents were killed and he swore revenge. It\'s like a wish version of Batman.Except Batman is actually cool.He apparently had a therapist after his parents died. Someone PLEASE GO TAKE THAT GUY\'S license, because it obviously didn\'t work.Alex, and I quote:""Is not a TOY, so don\'t play with him unless you want to get hurt"" WHAT KIND OF FUCKING TOYS WERE YOU PLAYING WITH WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD YOU PSYCOPATH.But yeah, Alex\'s broken record was to please: ""stop trying to humanize me, I am your bad guy."" He also guarantees people that""biological reactions can be mastered""Good fucking luck next time you have to sneeze BRO. Hope you don\'t fucking explodeOur female main character was the SUNSHINE OF THE PARTY! The most giggly adorable girl who apparently ""fucks like a porn star"" (this author had a really really really weird obsession with porn stars since she mentioned them not once, but four times during her entire book)Our FMC had her own mother try to drown her, then proceeded to kill herself from guilt. Her ex cheated on her multiple times, abused her physically BUT SHE IS SUUUUUUUUUCH A SUNSHINE and all she needs is to get dicked down to still see the good in people. Fuck therapy.It\'s so hilarious that in the desperate need to make this book a tiktok sensation... she added so many things that absolutely don\'t go together for the sake of hype, but guess what? Tiktok is that predictable.She succeeded.Now, moving on to the sex scenes. Probably the most hilarious thing I have ever read in my life. Christian Grey comparison aside, we get the most AMAZING LINES I HAVE EVER READ in my book blogger career.""I am turning you into my fuck doll""(?????????????? I mean if you want herunresponsive... I have something to tell ya...We might need to call you a new therapist, or maybe get you into jail.I haven\'t decided yet.)He literally describes the view of her on his bed as a:""sacrificial virgin waiting defilement""Every time she puts her hand on his dick, she""can feel the power it emanates"".I mean, by all means, put a cape on it and give it a marvel contract.Well, anyways... a bunch of stupid things happen, this book is MASSIVELY long for some UNKNOWN reason, just like Alex\'s penis. Near the end, our HEROOOOO threatens the mean girl to destroy HER company, because he has that sort of power, if she doesn\'t tell him where his girlfriend is. It has the same energy as:""my daddy is a lawyer""in third grade.It pains me to say this entire review constitutes of quotes from this book, because honestly? It\'s all I needed. It\'s embarrassing enough on it\'s own. I hardly did any work here.Maybe I will read the next one since you guys love it so much, let\'s see.Anyways, my stomach hurts from laughing.*wipes sweat off brows*'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'the red in the flag that is alex volkov is from all my brain cells he has murdered, and the blood of the people he has actually murdered 😍everybody who said he begged and grovelled for a year LIED, i hope you guys have to wear wet socks for the rest of ur lives 🤠 he spends half a year preparing to stalk ava, and then does that for the next half. no tears were shed on his end, i demand my money back.i wanted to be nice to this book just because of howunintentionally hilarious and satiricalit was, but then hesangand all of that was out the window.i respectfully don\'t care enough about the plot to go into details about it, but if you must know, it was very poorly executed and i did not care one bit for anything that was going on.i do want to elaborate on the absolute JOY that alex and ava are though 🥰 apparently miss huang agrees bec they\'re her favorites.meet,Alex(H): he has a god complex you can\'t rival, a dick for days, a massive ego, works as a full-time stalker for six months, will get jealous of a fly if it dares to hover around ava for more than a second, thinks he\'s the most special mf on god\'s green earth, isn\'t scared of anything not even wild animals, has HSAM (Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory) that he uses to relive a traumatic event of his past bec he\'s weird like that, is a walmart version of Christian Grey, and he\'s so freaking smart that he quadrupled his investments and also became a millionaire in high school because of a technology he invented 🥺💅🏻 doesn\'t he sound like an absolute bombastic slay?let me tell you he\'s acc not. alex isa man written by a woman who has probably never had any interaction w a man beforehe\'s so cringey you won\'t believe it - but I\'ll let him speak for himself 😵\u200d💫╰─▸ ❝Nothing turned me off more than desperation, which reeked stronger than their perfume.❞says the guy that left his job and followed ava around for six months like a pathetic loser 🙏🏻╰─▸ ❝Besides, everyone knew I was the power behind the throne, anyway.❞power, throne, kingdom - shut ur fucking mouth fr 🤡╰─▸ ❝It was the same thing that would’ve gone through any red-blooded male’s mind.

On one hand, I really liked this book but on the other, I really didn’t. I will try to be as thorough as I possibly can in this review so let’s get on with it...🔹What I liked:✏Characters:〰 Here’s the thing, I liked the characters, I really did. Both Ava and Alex were loveable and the side characters were also interesting and intriguing. I even liked Bridget and wasn’t bothered by the fact that she was aliteralprincess (which, granted, is utterly unbelievable but I still found that aspect to be amusing despite its utter incredulity).✏Tropes:〰 The writing style was good and the book literally had all the tropes that I usually adore (brother’s best friend, grumpy/sunshine pairing...) and they were actually well done.〰 I really liked the fact that Ava’s brother did not forgive Alex at the end. Honestly, I thought that was very realistic considering Alex’s betrayal of their friendship and the way he manipulated both Josh and Ava. I also found that aspect quite refresh since it leaves their friendship open for further development later on in the series (in Josh and Jules’ book).✏Representation:〰 We have a beautiful Asian heroine and a hero of Ukrainian descent, which we just love to see. I also really appreciated all the small details that the author included to help us learn more about the Chinese culture; that aspect was honestly well done and seamlessly integrated in the story.〰 The first half of the book was really entertaining and I was sure that this would become a very fun and quick read for me. The second half however is where things started to go south in my opinion and this is why...🔹What I did not like:✏Plot:〰 During the second half of the book I started getting the feeling that I was watching a bad soap opera. Things started becoming incredibly unbelievable and cheesy. For instance, the whole thing with Ava’s father was such a cliché that I was honestly surprised that none of the author’s beta readers had told her to cut out this “plot twist”. The writing in these instances also needed rework since they reinforced the feeling that I was watching a Disney villain giving his speech and congratulating himself on his wickedness. This is an example of what I mean:“Michael’s face remained anguished for several more seconds before it twisted and morphed into a hideous mask. His eyes gleamed with delighted malice, and his mouth spread into a mocking smile. [...] ‘Bravo’. He slow-clapped. ‘I almost had you,’ he told me. ‘You should’ve seen yourself’I swear, Mrs. James was real,’he mimicked, laughing.”〰 And don’t even get me started on how Micheal was the man who supposedly killed his parents only to find out that Alex’s uncle was actually behind the whole thing. I would genuinely be shocked if anyonewasshocked by this “turn of events”.✏Aspects of the writing style and characterization:〰 And this is what I personally think was my biggest issue with this book. The novel does an awful lot of ‘telling’ instead of ‘showing’. Both characters go from not knowing each other to being madly in love in a short amount of time. And the thing is? They’ve supposedly been seeing each other and getting to know each other for months by that point. But we as readers are only told of this passage of time instead of shown the moments that they spent together. This is not something that can work in a romance novel. We need to see the main characters slowly opening up to each other and starting to like each other in order for us to believe in their romance. This is why some romances that are set within the span of a single week work. Because its not about how many months the main characters have known each other, it’s about how valuable and detailed each interaction between the two is.〰 This happened once again when it came to the groveling aspect. A literalyearpasses in which the hero is supposedly groveling and begging the heroine to take him back. However, readers are once again not shown any part of said groveling. This is what I mean:“Alex and I had developed a new... well, I wasn’t sure if I could call it a friendship, but it was a step up from whatever we had when he arrived in London a year ago.”〰 Ummm, I’m sorry what? You can’t go from having the heroine say that she will never forgive the hero to having her say something like ‘Alex and I developed a friendship over the past year’. If you do that then you can’t expect your readers to believe in the legitimacy of said friendship because guess what (and I cannot stress this enough):👏Passage of time alone does not a convincing relationship make.👏We need to see the development between the characters in order to root for them because frankly? By that point I neither believed in Ava and Alex’s love nor did I believe in Alex’s remorse because I hadn’t been able to see him truly grovel. That said, I honestly hope that this aspect of the novel gets better in the second installment.🔹Final thoughts:〰 If you read any of my ‘pre-reading’ updates then you know that I had incredibly high expectations for this book. I had never read any of this author’s works before but this novel contained all of the tropes that I usually adore. The snippets that I saw on the author’s instagram page also reinforced my belief that this was definitely a book that I would enjoy. Hell, when I first added this on Goodreads it literally only had about 20 or 25 other people who had also added it (so I truly found it very early on). That said, while I wouldn’t necessarily say that I was disappointed or let down by the execution in this book (because, as I previously mentioned, I enjoyed many aspects of it), I will still say that I think many things needed rework and further editing.〰 Finally, I do think that I might read the sequel since I truly enjoyed the friendship group in here and I do think that this author has a lot of potential. So do I recommend this book? I think this could be the perfect example of a guilty pleasure read in my opinion. Many things needed to be done differently but this wasn’t a horrible read in any way.———————Instagram:https://www.instagram.com/rose_books2/—————————————————————————-PRE-READING UPDATES:———————-Ok but I just stalked the author’s instagram and now I’m pretty freaking excited about this😩———————-Mmmm I think I’m intriguedFr tho, gotta love the grumpy/sunshine trope loll.'}]"

A Court of Wings and Ruin (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #3)
",Sarah J. Maas,4.47,2063840,1685,"Fantasy, Romance, Young Adult, Romantasy, Fiction, New Adult, Fae",703,02-05-2017,"The epic third novel in the #1New York TimesbestsellingCourt of Thorns and Rosesseries by Sarah J. Maas.Feyre has returned to the Spring Court, determined to gather information on Tamlin's actions and learn what she can about the invading king threatening to bring her land to its knees. But to do so she must play a deadly game of deceit. One slip could bring doom not only for Feyre, but for everything-and everyone-she holds dear.As war bears down upon them all, Feyre endeavors to take her place amongst the High Fae of the land, balancing her struggle to master her powers-both magical and political-and her love for her court and family. Amidst these struggles, Feyre and Rhysand must decide whom to trust amongst the cunning and lethal High Lords, and hunt for allies in unexpected places.In this thrilling third book in the #1New York Timesbestselling series from Sarah J. Maas, the fate of Feyre's world is at stake as armies grapple for power over the one thing that could destroy it.","[{'rating': 1, 'content': ""202.That’s the number of times that the word “mate,” in any of its hellish forms, is used in this book.TWO.HUNDRED.AND.TWO.https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...That statistic alone should be enough to justify this one star rating. If you feel satisfied enough to just remove yourself from this review, run with that feeling. Because I have, like. Seven pages of sh*t to complain about.That’s if I’m efficient.And I’ve never been an efficient reviewer. Once. In my life. I counted two hundred (and two) uses of a word over seven hundred pages. That shouldn’t scream “rational and in control of her passionate fury” to you.So buckle up, buttercup. We’ve got some categories to run through.DISCLAIMER: This review is teeming with spoilers. It is also X-rated, due to the strength of my anger and the copious sex scenes in the source material.I HATE THESE CHARACTERSRhysmakes me cringe harder than Renee Zellweger in Bridget Jones’ Diary. (At least that movie has both Colin Firth and Hugh Grant to distract me from Renee viciously critiquing her own body and, like, spilling coffee all over herself or whatever.) He is capable of two actions, like a mildly impressive Ken doll: 1) sex person and 2) valiant hero trying to kill himself in the name of his friends constantly. Either he is full on f*cking Feyre (sick alliteration, Emma) or he must be actively prevented from jumping in front of poisoned weapons with the half-hearted motivation of Heroism To Save My Family (even if it’s not at all clear why doing this would save them, because whatever none of the plans in this book make a lick of sense anyway).Because, as if this book weren’t fun enough, it rivals the Fast and the Furious franchise for use of the my-real-family-is-the-one-I-made-not-the-one-I-was-born-with cliché.Like Rhys,Feyrealso manages to find time in her packed schedule of sex scenes and repetitive dialogue to be incredibly, incontrovertibly dumb. For example, when she traps Ianthe and ties her up or whatever, she spends an unbelievable amount of time indulging an evil-villain-revenge rant. Just enough time for her to be CAUGHT BY THE DAEMATI (a Cassandra Clare-esque douchey term that pretty much means “species of bad guy,” to the best of my recollection). So much of this book was me silently screaming.Speaking of the aforementioned schedule, it’s no wonder that that thing Feyre used to do called “painting” is dropped like a hot potato. She never does it, but it’s mentioned a handful of times in the beginning of the book. And then forgotten. And then, suddenly, almost at the merciful end of this suffering:“The movement so perfect that I knew I’d one day paint it.”We’restillpretending that Feyre paints? Between the same diverse selection of identical sex scenes, identical training scenes, identical war discussion scenes, I don’t think she has time for something so banal as a singular interest or hobby. Idk if we’ll have time; I think she’ll have to get to third base with Rhys in a perfumed bath later.At least Feyre is brave and strong, though. Which is why she’s “too tired” to do anything after a loooong day of watching other people fight in a battle, followed by Mor winnowing her home. So courageous. How does she do it.Plus, she’s a brilliant friend. Which is why, when Morrigan confronts her for lying, leaving, making her and everyone else fear she has died and also making Mor responsible for it, Feyre’s response is “OH YA??? WELL YOU HAVE A CRUSH ON AZRIEL.”Truly a depiction of a powerful woman for the ages.And I don’t getLucien’s appeal. Do we like him out of the same reason we like Draco? (I’m saying “we” as if I like either of those characters.) Is it an omg-he’s-just-trying-to-do-right-he-didn’t-know-any-better type situation? Because Draco is a child trying to impress a father who doesn’t love him and I still don’t totally buy that. I’m still not a Draco fan. And Tamlin is not Lucien’s daddy, although...maybe a more interesting book if he were.CassianandAzrielare both flat and boring.Amrenis characterized so inconsistently that it’s impossible for me to know whether I like her or not. (I’m going to say “not” - seems like a safer bet.)Nestais almost cool, but the whole I Am Mean And Hard And Damaged thing goes too far. AndElainjust floats around and lets things happen to her.Morrigan, never all that interesting, now just represents the worst bisexuality rep I’ve ever read.It’s never a good sign when you’re praying for characters to die in battle just so you can catch a f*cking break.But guess what. None of them do.THE WRITING SUCKS, ON BOTH A COPYEDITING LEVEL AND A SUBSTANTIVE LEVELI truly believe that whatever team of sad sacks was assigned to copyedit this book was physically unable to attentively read it. And I cannot blame them. But it does allow for some hilarious mistakes to make it through these dull, dull pages.Example: “She did not avert her eyes from the Morrigan.” That pesky “the” makes her seem like a pro wrestler, or someone with a fun nickname, rather than the personification of the worst bi rep ever to grace young adult pages. But we’ll get to that.There are so many ellipses and dashes and italicizations and...other - ways: ofbreakingup the TEXT that it actually gave me motion sickness. On top of everything else this book has made me suffer through.Maybe if a copyeditor had found the strength to make it through this book, they could have stopped the way SJM insists on using the term “Hybern.” IT MEANS SO MANY THINGS. “Hybern” is used as the nomer of the evil king, the word for his people, the name of his kingdom, and the title of the land it’s situated on. That is just...basic bad worldbuilding, no?Also, a monster creature thing described as having no eyelids narrows its eyes. This inspired a fifteen minute long discussion with my roommates on whether eyes can narrow without eyelids. We came to a unanimous consensus: no, they cannot.Also, asValpointed out in her amazing review of this book, the words “vulgar gesture” are used over. And over. And over again. WHAT DO THESE USES MEAN. WHY DO THEY CONSTANTLY INSPIRE LAUGHTER IN WHATEVERGLORIFIED PROPCHARACTER WHO HAPPENS TO BE NEARBY. IS THIS TACTIC SUPPOSED TO REPLACE ACTUAL JOKES OR BANTER? Because it doesn’t. It just makes me angry, and also confused, which makes meeven angrier.And who thought that was even possible.WHAT IS THIS ATTEMPT AT HIGH FANTASY LANGUAGEExcept then, y’know, Rhys and Feyre and the Gang are also so hip and cool and up to date that this book uses the word “fuckable,” a word so slang-y that my laptop recognizes it as a typo for “suckable” or “faceable,” whatever the hell those words are.Otherwise, the only other remarkable attempt at making this any different from the way humans speak in 2017: the use of the word “male.”Women are sometimes called “females” in this, but are also called women and girls and whatnot. Men, on the other hand, are absolutely only called males. There’s an amazing moment when SJM refers to Rhys as a man, and then instantly, like, corrects herself. So it reads on the page as “man - male -”It makes no sense. I love it.It’s truly the little things.THE END OF THIS BOOK IS JUST A LISTING OF CLICHESAs the war we’ve waited for finally arrives, and so does the time for motivational speeches and tragic goodbyes and other things that fail to make me feel something, SJM loses it entirely.Nearly every line of dialogue in this section is just a cliché, and so I will copy and paste them here, for your perusal and accompanying amusement.“Leave this world…a better place than how you found it.”“One life may change the world.”“I believe everything happens for a reason.”“It is the family you make, not the one you are born into, that matters.”“Light can be found even in the darkest of hells.”“The great joy and honor of my life has been to know you.”“I wasn’t sure if in the entire history of Illyria, there had ever been such a discussion.”So bad. And, therefore, so good.LET’S LAUGH AT DUMB THINGSThe moments when this may or may not be attempting to instill some sort of entertainment or amusement in its reader do not work at all. Luckily, we have something much better: Really dumb stuff. It is much more fun (and nourishing to the very soul, like a bowl of chicken soup - so pretty much the series of books “Chicken Soup for the Soul”) to laugh at something unintentional and dumb than it is to laugh at a cheap joke. This is why the show America’s Funniest Home Videos has been on for twenty-eight seasons, and like a thousand interchangeable bad sitcoms are canceled every year.For example, this passage. Feyre and Rhysand are apart, blah blah blah, it’s the tragedy of the century (or millennium, since these boring ass people live for infinity, because there is no justice in this world). Unsurprisingly, they use their mind control powers for a saintly motivation: sexting. Which is already so hilarious. But it gets even better, because:“I sent back an image of me sticking out my tongue at him.My clothes were back on when his answer arrived.Like mine, it was wordless, a mere image. Like mine, Rhysand’s tongue was out.But it was occupied with doing something else.”I choose to interpret this statement the same way a middle schooler interprets the existence of performer Marilyn Manson based on a shady rumor he once heard about a surgery to remove three ribs. I believe that this is incontrovertible evidence that Rhysand can suck his own d*ck. WHAT ELSE COULD HE POSSIBLY BE DOING. WHAT COULD IT POSSIBLY BE OCCUPIED WITH. SJM I JUST WANNA TALK.But just as often as I was making myself laugh by making Rhys my YA fantasy version of Marilyn Manson, I was being equally amused by seemingly innocuous lines. Like when Eris, scary villain/abuser extraordinaire, was bidding The Night Gang adieu and said, “See you at the meeting in twelve days.” I MEAN. WHAT. WHO SPEAKS LIKE THAT. Even dialogue is just an opportunity to force an info dump. You guys, seriously: this book isso poorly written.LET’S SCREAM ABOUT DUMB THINGSSometimes, or most of the time depending on how you look at it, I do not want to laugh at the dumb things. Sometimes I am incapable of it, because this book is an ungodly length and so much of it is long-term stupidity.Chapter 45, for example. Or, as I like to call it, “That Meeting in Twelve Days Finally Happens.” Yes, this book is so boring that we are expected to anticipate an actual, literal meeting. Sure, it’s a meeting between high lords to talk about war, but it’s still a sit-down political discussion. And also it’s just the same endless repetitive cycle of insult dialogue feat. fun moments of The Night Gang being the least convincing people on the entirety of the Earth.There’s an especially great moment in that adrenaline-inducing conference. For the 800 pages leading up to it, Rhys is all,“Ok, Feyre. Listen up. Number one thing - just don’t show your powers, k? Long story short the Powerful Men are going to get pissy and then…well y’know these negotiations are the most important thing to happen in hundreds of years, which I should know because I’ve been alive for that long, even though you’re, what, fresh outta adolescence? Anyway just the only thing you should do is not show your powers.”To which Feyre’s response is,“Got it. *shows powers instantly*”YES. Feyre shows her powers at the meeting!! So quickly!!! She doesn’t even try all that hard, and, as promised, it almost derails the nonstop excitement of this much-anticipated civilized forum! Almost. Except then everything works out, as it always does, by Feyre saying something totally normal, 6/10 at best, and everyone being like “wow omg...who is this girl...she is so smart and brave and honest and we respect her so much” so that Rhys can be like “that’s my mate lol.”IRRELEVANT COMPLAININGThe only way to make the experience of reading a deeply unpleasant, extremely long book worse is to publish that book with goddamn tissue paper pages. This was like reading the Bible but without the action. And with a whole lot more smut.I’m tucking this quote in this section too, because I don’t know if I’m being persnickety, but at one point, it’s said that“Only a madman would wield the might of his army just to get revenge on three women.”And my question is, why use the word “women”? Why not “people”? Is it more insane if it’s women? Why is that? TELL ME WHY. REALLY I JUST WANNA TALK.PLOTLINE? WHAT PLOTLINEThis book is just...so boring.There are countless info dumps, which, I mean. There’s no excuse for that in a third book. This was going to be the last book in the series, when there was still hope in the world and I prayed that somehow SJM actually was writing these books for some sort of artistic fulfillment rather than money. How, I ask you, would there still be so much sh*tty worldbuilding in the last book in a series?OH YES, THIS BOOK IS DEFINITELY WOKE AND NOT THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF THAT ENTIRELYSJM has been getting a lot of sh*t lately for her white/straight/cis narratives. So it’s no surprise that she would try to get those pesky activists off her back this time. Unfortunately, she does a remarkably bad job.This book is all straight people except for LGBT+ relationships based on sex alone, or in an unequal relationship wherein one person has authority over another. (Examples: a high lord whose bisexuality extends purely to the fact that he’s into threesomes; a military captain dating his high lord/commander/boss.)Plus, there’s bisexuality rep so terrible it took me hours to make it through a handful of pages. But that gets a category of its own.I also shouldn’t be surprised at the redemption of abusers in this book. Because Tamlin, in ACOTAR, was just a Nice Guy. Fine. But the fangirls loved a certain bad boy guest star with purple eyes. So, instead of creating a love triangle or transitioning between love interests like a normal person, SJM made him into an actual abuser. A villain.That’s also fine. But you can’t just redeem him like you could redeem the unloved side of a love triangle. Because you made him into a genuinely bad person.Unfortunately, SJM must have missed that memo. She must have missed it three times, actually, because Eris also gets redemption (and a throne!). As does his enabler brother, Lucien. Wonderful. Abuse apologists for the win.But this book is totally, definitely feminist, right??? I mean, female protagonist! War plotline! It must be, by default! So when Cassian says“I told you that the moment we started letting females into our group, they’d be nothing but trouble”, and woke king Rhys responds,“You actually said you needed a reprieve from staring at our ugly faces, and that someladieswould add some much needed prettiness for you to look at all day.”it’s totally fine!So it’s an utter shock that this narrative also lives nearly entirely within the bounds of gender roles. Reading about men (Rhys, Cassian, Azriel, all the high lords) fighting in battle while the women (Feyre, Mor, Elain, Nesta, Cresseida) watch and tend to the wounded later is sorefreshing. Doesn’t make me want to blow my brains out at all.And no, Mor being assigned to babysit Feyre later on, only heading into battle because Feyre tricks her into fighting so she can sneak away does not make it better, thanks.This is definitely, certainly the feminist YA fantasy you’ve been waiting for, folks.THE WORST BI REP EVER TO HIT THE SHELVES, WHICH IS INSANE BECAUSE WHEN IS THERE E V E R GOOD BI REPBut I haven’t mentioned the most unforgivable thing yet. The thing that made this book my first SJM one-star, after giving every other book I’ve read by her two stars. The thing that actually made me feel real hatred and fury and, worst of all, sadness.Truly, the worst bisexual representation I have ever read comes in the final chapters of this book. I’ve read a lot of bad bisexual rep. And it’s endlessly upsetting. But none of it felt quite like this.Apparently, Sarah J. Maas decided in the third book that she wanted to stop getting sh*t for her heteronormativity. So she decided to take a character who had been established as straight, and make her bi.So she took this character, Morrigan. She makes Morrigan cry. She writes Morrigan’s impassioned speech to Feyre. This is Morrigan’s coming out, for the first time. Morrigan says that she prefers women. To the point that she is only capable of feeling romantic love for a women.But occasionally, she will force herself to sleep with a man. In order “to keep people from looking too closely.” Instead of telling the man who has been in love with her for centuries that she doesn’t love him back, won’t ever love him back, she forces herself to sleep with men when he’ll know that she’s done it, so that she still seems straight but he’ll know she doesn’t love him.And the author dubs it bisexuality.I hate that she felt entitled to use this underrepresented, misunderstood sexuality as a playing piece in her own quest to be well-liked. I hate that the hundreds of thousands of people who read this book have been given this depiction of bisexuality. And I hate that Sarah J. Maas will keep writing wildly successful books. Books in this very series, depicting this character in this way and calling it “bisexuality.”It’s unfair. It’s awful. And I am never, never, never going to forget that it happened.Bottom line: I didn’t expect to like this book.

No, I don’t. Good kids.“You High Lords really do love your melodrama, don’t you?”(As if I hadn\'t got enough ammo already.)For honesty\'s sake, the last two thirds of the book I could only bring myself to skim through (and I\'m quite proud of myself for managing even that). The first third had accurately enlightened me as to what I was to expect, and my (abysmally low) expectations were met point by point.We girls of the SmutClub weren\'t able to do a proper buddy read as we did last year with ACoMaF due to real life kicking our asses. However, I\'m sure you don\'t want to missSarah\'sandReyes\'sreviews, andEmer\'scall for honesty and good sense when it comes tothe target market of this series(and of theThrone of Glassseries too, at this point) perfectly highlights a problem I haven\'t been able to wrap my mind around since it first arose.•First of all, I\'d like to take a moment to answer a question that no one asked but that I think it fair to take into account nonetheless, said question being, ""If you evidently don\'t like Maas\'s books, why do you keep reading them?""Very good point indeed.I used to consider her books a guilty pleasureuntil, well, yesterday. The word ""pleasure"" in that expression, though, baffled me very much even before. More correctly, reading her was an experience akin to getting your first period at school and noticing too late (mortallyembarrassing), while ranting about it later was an honest if inclement exercise in snark, just as reading other people\'s reviews with previous knowledge of the book was pure amusement, be them positive or negative, and this latter reason is probably what always convinced me to suffer a little for the greater fun. Sometimes I also enjoyed some parts, so mine wasn\'t all sadism, after all. ButA Court of Wings and Ruin? (I still have no clue about what this absurd title is supposed to mean.) This one wassheer torture.A bore. Like havinga pitchfork repeatedly shoved in the eyeballs.(I should refer you tomy review ofA Court of Mist and Fury, which already contains many, if not all, of the issues I had with this final installment too, because since I\'ve read that book with way more attention than I did ACoWaR, you\'d probably find that one more specific and generally accurate.)•The writing gets worse. It\'s a miracle -or whatever its opposite would be called. Saying that it\'smelodramaticdoesn\'t begin to describe it anymore; admitting that its basic rule isemotional manipulationwould be such an understatement, my fingers itch. Everything is amplified, everything is exaggerated, everything makes twice the noise that it should make proportionally to its dimensions. Which is to say,everything becomes grotesque.Ridiculousness abounds, especially when matters of the heart (you haveno ideahow much I struggled not to use some other word that would have been more fit to the case at hand there) are concerned. I\'ll make just two quick examples both taken from chapter 14.The examples may contain mild spoilers.“Where are my sisters?” The thought clanged through me, jarring as a pealing bell.Rhys paused, hand slipping from my hair as his smile faded. “At the House of Wind.” He straightened, swallowing—as if it somehow checked him. “I can—take you to them.” Every word seemed to be an effort.But he would, I realized. He’d shove down his need for me and take me to them, if that was what I wanted. My choice.It had always been my choice with him.”To spell it out, what Feyre\'s voice is implying here is that one point in the never-ending list of reasons why Rhysand is worth worshipping is that he is able to keep it in his pants ten minutes longer so that she can go say hello to her sisters, whom she hasn\'t seen in more than a month and who, last she saw them, had just undergone a devastating trauma. It is evident that Maas isstillshoving in our faces that wemustabsolutely love Rhysand... a pity she isstillpicking all the wrong reasons, because what I think when I read a scene like this is ""Someone please lock him away"" (and I\'m being kind).Example number two(trigger warning: this one\'s rather disgusting. I for sure gagged once or twice.), this oneto show what I mean by ""overwritten"" and ""grotesque"" and ""ew"":“You have a choice,” he murmured against my cheekbone. “Either I lick every inch of you clean …” His hand grazed the tip of my breast, circling lazily. As if we had days and days to do this. “Or you can get into the bath that should be ready by now.”I pulled away, lifting a brow. “Are you suggesting that I smell?”Rhys smirked, and I could have sworn my core pounded in answer. “Never. But …” His eyes darkened, the desire and amusement fading as he took in my clothes.“There is blood on you. Yours, and others’. I thought I’d be a good mate and offer you a bath before I ravish you wholly.”I huffed a laugh and brushed back his hair, savoring the silken, sable strands between my fingers. “So considerate. ThoughI can’t believe you kicked everyone out of the house so you could take me to bed.”“One of the many benefits to being High Lord.”“What a terrible abuse of power.”That half smile danced on his mouth. “Well?”“As much as I’d like to see you attempt to lick off a week’s worth of dirt, sweat, and blood…”His eyes gleamed with the challenge, and I laughed again. “Normal bath, please.”You see what I mean? Maas triesso hardto write steamy, sexy moments that she stopped noticing that the way she writes them became (a long time ago I dare say)utterly ridiculous. What sane person in their right mind would ever say ""I’d like to see you attempt to lick off a week’s worth of dirt, sweat, and blood off me?""Many, many,many, if not all, of the problems this book has are linked to the writing,silly,childish,bloated,cheesy. It sourseverything.•Not totally disconnected from this, there is also the insistence with whichFeyre\'s bliss with her Court of Friends and Familyis continually trotted out, especially if there\'s the opportunity to describe it through someone else\'s point of view, as it happens with Lucien\'s in the first part of the book.There is a reason if one of the axioms of storytelling is that talking about happiness is difficult: it\'s uninteresting, poor of nuances, syrupy: people don\'t want to hear about happiness. “Happy families are all alike,” after all.•One of the main points ofFeyre\'s character arcshould be her discovery of independence and of her inner strength, of the fact that she doesn\'t necessarily need anyone, especially a man, to guide and direct her every step. A shame the impression we get from the whole series isthe very opposite: Feyre\'s character growth (not automatically meant as an upward trajectory) seems to be irreversiblyconnected to the ""male"" who is (even virtually) at her side. In this book, she and Rhysand are pretty much a single entity. Can I feel a tinge of outrage at this, please? We women are very able to be complete on our own, thank you very much. The whole""mating system"" (I can\'t even, it\'s too ridiculous)has me not exactly convinced in this regard too. Various characters throughout the book keep having this attitude, especially towards Feyre, that impliesa vision of women as mere objects of sexual interest, pawns in a purely male game of lust and authority, and they are never challenged because their brain is full of crap, but simply because they insult Feyre–and not even Feyre as herself, but Feyre as Rhysand\'s mate, like during the meeting of the High Lords in chapter 46, when someone calls Feyre ""human filth"" and Rhysand\'s reply is physical violence plus a laconic“Don’t ever,” Rhys said, hands sliding into his pockets, “speak tomy matelike that again.”Again, everything, even on the level of language, revolves around a man and the girl\'s relationship to said man. I fail to see the women\'s empowerment in this.•I\'ve never seensuch a cheesy ending. It feltlike I had just swallowed a monumental bucket of melted sugarand I couldn\'t even breathe because the very air got stuck to the sticky back of my throat. Basically it made me finally understand that Maas\'s main interest was to make sure none of her precious babies got so much as a scratch.➽ I was trying to find a way to be tactful and diplomatic about this, but there is none. The first book was nice and very entertaining, the second was still entertaining but way less nice,the third is ignoble. Bottom line:this series is crap.Don\'t read it(and if you know me and my reviews, you know Ineveronce recommendednotto read a book, nor do I think I shall ever do it again, because the fact that I don\'t like something doesn\'t mean that nobody would or should. Besides, I don\'t really believe in second-hand opinions. So the fact that I think this book will actively damage your brains and that I\'m warning you off it should really speak volumes in itself).

It\'s unpolished, full of unnecessary repetition and lazy placeholder sentences.Maascanwrite. She\'s proved it over and over again, which makes ACOWAR seem almost criminal. I think the strain of writing two novels a year finally caught up with her. ACOTAR AND ACOMAF don\'t really count because they were written long beforeThrone of Glasswas published. All she had to do was clean up. But ACOWAR was written back-to-back withEmpire of Storms, which was a beefy number on its own.Fervent as I was for ACOWAR, I wouldn\'t have minded waiting another year if it meant getting quality content.Second is the ending.Rhys lives, Amren lives, everybody fucking lives.Where are the sacrifices? How it can possible that no one in this bloated main cast dies? (Don\'t you bloody dare point to Feyre\'s dad. He was barely a presence the entire series, and I remain firmly convinced Maas brought him back just to fill the death toll and shut up people like me.)I understand Rhys\'s resurrection—he\'s Feyre\'s mate and fan favorite and therefore too important to die—but Amren too? Her losing her godly power is not a sacrifice. She\'s still High Fae. Why not make her human? Why not have a human serve in the Night Court? Or why not have Cassian or someone else lose their wings? Quite a few reviewers (and me included) havementioned this already, but Maas undeniably has an obsession with inhumanly powerful characters.On the subject of Rhys, it would have been so, so cool for Feyre to be the sole ruler of the Night Court. The first High Lady in history. And it would have been a fitting end to her character arc. She was dependent on a man in the first book, was broken by the same man in the second, and then healed and made to see she could be powerful and independent by another man. In the third, she stands alone, back straight, strong and proud, without a man. Obviously I\'m oversimplifying things here, but you can\'t deny the pieces line up.Also, that deus ex machina army in the end. Oh, we\'re on the edge of losing! All is lost! BUT WAIT here\'s an army. And ANOTHER army!Another thing that bothered me is howunbelievably powerful Feyre is.There is feminism, which is an underlying theme for her character, and there is what-the-fuckery. Near the beginning of the book, she is able to take on two daemati (powerful fae) who have a thousand years of fighting experience over her. Later, after she accidentally ingests a drug that strips her of her powers, they still magically flare back to life to help her triumph over two seasoned High Fae fighters.Right, I think I\'ve bitched enough about the bad.Let\'s get to the good.I love the characters.The Inner Circle, Lucien, Nesta, Elain... they are a huge part why I rated ACOWAR as high as it is. Feyre and Rhys—in this book and this book only—aren\'t as interesting. Their story in terms of conflict was finished in ACOMAF and although I enjoy how Maas explores how normal couples argue and make up, I\'m not as invested in them as before. There are too many other stories begging to be told: Lucien\'s, Elain\'s, Nesta and Cassian\'s, Mor\'s, Tamlin\'s.Yes, Tamlin. This fandom is too hard on him—and too forgiving of Rhys. I will never forget what he did in ACOTAR. Yet because the story is filtered through Feyre\'s perspective, Rhys becomes a hero who makes mistakes and Tamlin becomes a monster who commits unforgivable sins. He genuinely thought the woman he loved had been abducted and was likely being tortured. I\'m not excusing his abusive behavior, but we have to remember he was suffering from PTSD too. He was trying to protect Feyre the best he could—just like Rhys by forcing Feyre to make that bargain with him way back in ACOTAR, fyi. Why does Rhys deserve dozens of free passes and not Tamlin?Hating the High Lord of Spring just because Feyre does is a disservice to the complexity of his character.I also like that Maas seems to bepulling away from the whole ""mates"" concept.Multiple characters within have strong romantic relationships without the mating bond, and those that do may not necessarily be right for each other.Much as I love the idea of Lucien and Elain, I get the feeling that she\'s setting them up for something different. Elain and Azriel, and Lucien and Vassa.The pacing is good, too.There aren\'t as many sex scenes as the previous book, which I was happy about, though not due to any misguided sense of propriety. I simply found myself bored reading about Rhys slamming his shaft up to the hilt or what not.Still lowkey mad the first thing Feyre did after coming back from the Spring Court is bang Rhys and not check on her traumatized sisters.While I liked them in ACOMAF, there are more important things going on here, like the war or the other courts.Final verdict? Bring on the spin-offs.My review of A Court of Thorns & RosesMy review of A Court of Mist & FuryMy review of A Court of Frost and StarlightMy review of A Court of Silver Flames'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I wish so much that I could tell you I loved this book... but I just didn\'t.After thinkingA Court of Mist and Furywas such a huge improvement fromA Court of Thorns and Roses, I was really excited for this third installment. I even preordered it. But I really struggled to get into the book from the very start. Frompacing issuestoawkward sex scenesthat did nothing for me, it was one disappointment after another.I\'ve said this before but I reallydislike Maas\'s sex scenes. At her best, she writes them strangely with words like ""branding"" and ""claiming"", but here they were just plain icky. With all the talk of ""mates"", ""growling"" and ""purring"", and the climaxing from stroking one another\'s wings, I felt like I\'d walked in on two animals rutting in the mud. Ugh.And another thing-- Feyre and Rhysand are already mated and loved up to their eyeballs so there wasno sexual tension, no will they/won\'t they, which made the sex scenes so boring.What\'s strange about these sex scenes is how they manage to somehow be both graphic and coy at the same time. Maas never actually uses explicit words. If a young kid picked up this book, they might assume Rhysand and Feyre were dancing or playing an instrument.His touch turned different. Exploring. Broad strokes and feather-light ones, arches and swirls and direct, searing lines.And her vagina is usually described as ""there"" or ""where I want him"". Then, at the same time, these scenes are weirdly overwritten, with her orgasm (obviously not called that) leaving her “skin glowing like a newborn star in its wake”. It\'s just really not my thing.I was disappointed with the writing in general, to be honest. Maas seemed to write a lot more ""tell"" and a lot less ""show"" than usual. I was especially disappointed at the wasted opportunity for some underhanded manipulation in the first part. After how the last book ended, Feyre was kind of ""undercover"" at the start and in a position for lies and sneakiness. Except it was mostly her swanning around and quietly seething to herself about how much she hated Ianthe and how much of a douche Tamlin is.I thought this whole part was boring when it should have been extremely tense and exciting.But I think the worst thing was the overall pacing. It\'s a long book, but I can normally sprint through Maas\'s works in a day, yet here it wassuch a slog. Especially the first half. It\'s taken up with a lot of character conversations and strategizing for the upcoming war with Hybern. It lacked a pull, a sense of urgency, some kind of tension to make me need to know what happens next.I cannot believe they\'ve announced anotherfour booksfor this series. Why??? I can only hope they are some kind of spin-off series because, otherwise, either a) we will have to suffer through who the fuck knows how many more awkward, unsexy Feyre/Rhysand sex scenes, or b) Maas will destroy Rhys\'s character and hook Feyre up with yet another hot fae dude. I\'m not sure which is more likely.The later chapters of this book picked up in pacing, but I think it wastoo little, too late. This is a whopping 700-page monster and it obviously didn\'t need to be. I will say that I liked how things were left with Tamlin, but seeing as that part was only a few sentences long, it doesn\'t make up for everything else.I\'m thinking this is where I drop out of this series.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Just published my latestBookTube Video- so excited to share it!The Written ReviewAfter that ending only one quote can adequately sum up my feelings:Something thumped in front of me.

Thank you for letting us dream and travel across the stars if only for a short time.I have been a massive fan of the ACOTAR series since the first book so I was highly anticipating ACOWAR.I was afraid I wouldn’t like the third book as much as I loved the second one but hell, I was so wrong. I swear, I don't know how many nerve cells this book cost me.Not only is the book thrilling and well-written. But it added a lot more complexity than I'd expected. Both in the characters and the plot.The progression brings aboutso many new faces(Have five to Helion, my second favourite High Lord), each of them unique in their own way.When Feyre was in the Spring Court, she was so over-powered like she is a goodness and no one can stop her -I was getting some unwanted Aelin’s vibe here– butthe plot was pretty well-driven after that, allowing each character to have its share of glory in Hybern Battle. And thank god for incredible plot twists or else I would have died a thousand times.The other thing that I really enjoyed is the fact thatthe book was unpredictable. I got all emotional becausethe story has a way of being built up and simply torn down piece by piece by a certain event and you are like “What the hell just happened?” and then being rebuilt once again.I literally went mental in one of the last scene – YES, THIS SCENE –my parents were actually concerned because of my change of emotions. I cried during the emotional moments, I got stressed during the battle scenes, I laughed so hard in others, I blushed during the bold sexy scenes, but most of all,I had – and still have believe me - embarrassing fangirling moments over the characters.I have a lot of favourite scenes.Like a lot especially those where a potential couple interact –You should have seen me during NESSIAN SCENES, I was a FANGIRL MONSTER– butone scene particular brought me to tear and that was RHYS’s SPEECH BEFORE the FINAL BATTLE.Overall, it wasan EPIC BOOK closing an AMAZING trilogy with immensely ENTERTAINING STORYLINE, characters TO LOVE and a DETAILED fantasy WORLD.Very much worth your time.What are you waiting for?""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Yay!

I have always been more of a fan of Sarah J Mass fan, but more towards her Thrown of Glass series. I think this is her best book so far. This book just has everything. Great characters, great story, secrets, betrayal, redemptions, ACTION!!!! You name it, it is here. 700 pages and not a line wasted. Hell, I would have been happy with another 700 pages of this standard. The character are great, but there is such great character development that no one is one dimensional the character are conflicted and complex with their own strengths and issues. Every time I learned something about one of the characters, I wanted to know more. Every character had their moment to shine in this book, and every character in this book could very easily star in their own book. That is the depth of the character in this story. Espicallly Rhysand, and anyone in the Court of Dreams.Since the last book, Feyre has returned to the Spring Court to destroy it from within. This is not Feyre crushed by her truma, suffocated by overprotection, or the powerless girl in a world of monsters/guardians. This is the angry, powerful, deadly calculating woman. I like the fact that Rhysand is every bit her match. I am actually interested to see which of them is the more powerful. So far, with centuries of experience behind battle, tactics, and studies, he seems to be a step ahead, but time will tell. However even with all this going on War is coming to Prythian and with all the High Lords in agreement (with their history of grudges and betrayal this is next to impossible ), they are still way out numbered against the King of Hybern and the power of the Calderon. Once again, it falls to the Court of Dreams to lead the charge not only against their enemies but the very thinking of many Prythians as well.This is just an awesome book. I don't think you have to read the other book in the series to love this book, but I would definitely recommend reading the whole series, but I definitely read this one. The more I read, the more I wanted to read. It took me through every emotion, the anger of betrayal, the pride in overcoming adversity, to the election of victory.

The pacing was better, the side characters had more roles and personality, and I appreciate that Feyre and Rhysand were depicted as a power couple that were both supporting and challenging each other. That being said, the writing is still a hot mess, but at least it was kinda funny (i.e. the excessive usage of mating bonds, the random gay monologue at the end, the haphazardly rushed conclusion, etc.)'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '1.)A Court of Thorns and Roses★★★★2.)A Court of Mist and Fury★★★[2023 reread]★★★this has been a journey rereading these books, but i am happy to report back that acowar was even better than i remember. maybe that is because of having read more in this series, finishing throne of glass, and reading the first two books in the crescent city series, but this truly exceeded my expectations.i loved seeing feyre continue to heal, continue to love, and continue to demand her own agency. I loved seeing the inner circle and easily falling even more in love with them. i am obsessed with the suriel, weaver, and bone carver, even if one of those broke my heart all over again on this reread. i am not sure if this is a spoiler thing to say, but i just have such a bigger curiosity and respect for these old gods… all the old gods.. and i’ll give sjm a lot of credit for the weaving of them into this story. back in the day, i thought the ending with feyre’s dad was foolish and i am here to report that it still feels foolish to me in 2023. and this book is still too long, and should have had 100+ pages edited from it.overall, i really did have such a fun time with this last book, and it really did have so much in it that i didn’t appreciate or pick up on before.tiktokmake me remember the “extra” girl feyre saves at the war camp when rescuing her sister and my mind is forever blown (and so curious) about that now.trigger + content warnings:war, death, murder, violence, gore, blood, incest implied, ptsd, nightmares, mentions of abuse in past, abuse in present, torture, mind manipulation magic, assault, drugging, depression, implication of sexual assault, physical assault, vomit, talk of sexual assault in past, kidnapping, captivity, verbal abuse, talk of infidelity in the past (not mcs), loss of a partner, loss of a parent, questionable talk of sex work.[2017 first read]★★★♡old review on my blogblog|instagram|youtube|kofi|spotify|amazon'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'BIBLIOBABBLE-https://youtu.be/y5UVdj8avvs(review & discussion)4.5*I DID THE THINGGGGG!!!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '✨my favorite book of the seriesdeserves an infinite number of stars ✨this.this right here is why i read.this book made me forget i was even reading. i cried, i mourned, i smiled. i had to actually force myself to put this down and get some sleep.i even started to kind of like Nesta?it’s been 3 minutes and i already cannot wait to re-read this.'}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""When the book you're highly anticipating has no cover, no title, and no synopsis:And a May 2017 release date:""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I loved how this was simply a continuation of ACOMAF.

Maas-ish in a way that did not surprise me but still made me terribly emotional. It wasn’t the ACOMAF-emotion, it wasn’t the EoS-emotion, it wasn’t the KoA-emotion, it wasn’t the HoEaB-emotion.This book has had its own emotion, I swear. It was tough, but somehow it was milder than the others previously named.Except for what happened on page 666.I cannot forgive that.I almost had both a heart attack and a stroke at the same time. And I am still not over it and I still feel like SJM pulling shit like this on me is exactly why I might need therapy.After the pure emotion of the previous book in the series,A Court of Wings and Ruinshows the final battle and all its raw and powerful emotions and actions. The dirty and the bad and the ugly – there are all of them there.This battle though is also freedom. No one is above scheming anymore. One must do everything they have in power to win because the cause is holy. There are sacrifices that must be made and plans that must be developed.This battle is also about unity and the book shows us how important this is. When there is a common goal at stake, then pride must be left outside when entering the war-tent. And true masters of war know that. Everyone must work together because victory is in the numbers.Aside from the compelling emotions that charge a book deeply powered by the promise of war, there is another facet of the plot.Thecharactersdiscover alter-egos, personalities that they did not know they had. Or they knew and they tried to reprimand them as hard as possible. Everyone has to overcome their own selves and that is a battle too.“It’s a rare person to face who they truly are and not run from it – not be broken by it.”Every character has their own secret that springs out with the tiniest occasion it gets to have. We see different angles of Cassian and Azriel, of Mor and Amren, of Nesta and Elain, of Tamlin and Lucien. They all fight two battles – of freedom and of self.Rhys and Feyre get to discover and unravel themselves too, but where Feyre finds her vengeful self, her strong and determined essence of a ruler, Rhysand shows us his vulnerable, soft side. The side that determined him to sacrifice himself to keep the ones he loved free.In this book, Rhysand is his ultimate selfless self. And honestly, nothing in this world would make me not love this hell of male.Sarah hit the jackpot with this gem, I’m telling you.If I had to get through absolutely every single emotion this book gave me then I’ll need something stronger than infused water to keep me going, a big cone of chocolate ice cream and probably a re-read of the whole ACOTAR series just to be sure I get everything right.I love how cunning and ruthless does SJM get when writing her books and even though sometimes there is no need for something like this, ACOWAR had to benefit from that. How else could such a mesmerising story end but in tears of frustration and raw feelings, I’m asking you?I honestly fell so hard for this series it became one of the things I think I’ll love in my life forever and ever. Glad I could read it and right now, writing this sorry of a review, I am considering so hard re-reading all of the books because damn, this helps my mental health in so many weird ways I can’t even seem to understand it myself.If you haven’t read the beauty of the ACOTAR series, please just go for it. Your life will be complete and you’ll probably thank me later ;)“Maybe one day, when the earth had grown old and died, when the stars had vanished, too…maybe then, we would return to this place.”'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4.25/5 stars""Remember that you are a wolf. And you cannot be caged.""I want to print off a picture of this cover and keep it in my wallet. Just in case anyone asks me if I have children, I can just show them this.Because all these assholes are my children.I don’t even know where to start with this review. I’ve been writing things and then deleting them for weeks. Every combination of words just isn’t therightcombination I need to right the perfect review.Sarah J. Maasalways releases not one, but two gigantic books a year and I don’t even know how to write a thousand word review? Actual proof that SJM is a writing goddess. We have been blessed from the heavens.So anyways, I\'ve decided to write whatever the hell comes to my head. So this entire review is one huge train wreck. It\'s an unorganized mess. I\'m gonna apologize for that right now. It also contains unmarked spoilers because it is almost three thousand words long and I don\'t have time to go through and mark every single spoiler.ACOWAR had the unfortunate luck of having to proceed the epicness that was A Court of Mist and Fury. It’s like being given $1,000,000, spending it all, then being given only a $100,000. Both amounts of money are nice to have, but obviously the million is the better option. Or like watching Beyonce perform live in concert, then having to watch a youtube video of Beyonce. Both are nice, great options, but there is always going to be the preferable one. I actually feel sorry for ACOWAR. It didn’t deserve to be a follow-up toA Court of Mist and Fury, but it really didn’t have an option. ACOWAR is better than ,A Court of Thorns and Rosesbut if you were to look up the definition of “prefection” in the dictionary, there will be a picture of the ACOMAF cover.Let me just get some of my thoughts & feels written down real quick. Beware, some might be spoilery. Please proceed with caution.A COURT OF THOUGHTS & FEELS1. Rhys is actually the best fictional character ever and I love him2. Feyre is actually the best fictional character ever and I love her3. Mor is actually the best fictional character ever and I love her4. Lucien is actually the best fictional character ever and I love him5. Amren is actually the best fictional character ever and I love her6. Azriel is actually the best fictional character even and I love him7. Cassian is actually the best fictional character ever and I love him8. Tamlin is actually the worst fictional character ever and I hate him9. I hate him so much10. Seriously11. Who okay’d Tamlin as a character?12. They should be fired13. Ianthe sucks too14.I’m glad that bitch got destoryed by the weaver15. We could have done without the sex scenes though.16. Remember when they were in the library? And all they wanted to do was have sex and not read. Talk about unrealistic.17. Rhys is the most dramatic character in YA…...pass it on18. The beginning, when Feyre was at the Spring Court, was actually my favorite part of the entire book? I loved it.19. I was just like yaaas Feyre girl you destroy those losers20. Also when Feyre and Rhys were reunited that was cool21. I wanted that scene to be longer though with a lot less sex22.Also the Suriel’s death was not okay’d by me and Sarah will be hearing from my lawyers23. Also who approved the term “vulgar gesture???” They should be fired too.24. Also if I ever hear the word ""mate"" again I\'m gonna spontaneous combust25. Cassian + Feyre = A friendship you will never have26. Mor is gay and all is okay27.Also no one in the night squad died which is really unrealistic to me? Also kinda disappointing. I was preparing myself for a death that never came, which took time away from me preparing my funeral.28. Also Amren is the best thing to come out of this book29. If the sequels aren’t about her I’m sueing.30. Also does anyone know why we were fighting this war? I don\'t remember.31. And also does anyone remember how the high lord powers work and why they all happen to be the most powerful people their courts but they get their position through genetics? Because if I haven\'t learned anything from YA literature, at least I\'ve learned that there will always be a chosen one who\'s more powerful than any ruler. So why hasn\'t that happened?CHARACTERS! cHARACTERSFeyre.Feyre is the best? She has evolved so much since the first book. And she\'s so loyal to those she loves. But if she hates you, you are dead. There is no way to save you.Rhys.I don\'t know if you knew this, but in certain countries it\'s agaisnt the law to hate Rhys. He\'s the best.Tamlin.Remember that time when you used to like Tamlin? Hahahaha he\'s an asshole.Mor.She\'s gay! Which is also the only diversity we got in this book.But she\'s the best.Amren.I want to be her when I grow up. She\'s the best.Lucien.I am just so glad that Lucien found God in this book.Cassian.I just love Cassian? I just want him to wrap me up in his wings. He\'s the best.Azriel.I would leave my boyfriend Kaz for Azriel. He\'s the best.SUMMARY AND COMMENTARYI’m going to do something I never done before in a review. There are so many scenes that I just want to talk about, that I’m gonna summarize a lot of this book so I can talk about them. This entire thing is spoilery so please don\'t read unless you\'ve read the book.So we start off athellthe Spring Court and Tamlin is being is douchebag self like always. He’s just hanging around, doing his meninist things. Not realizing that Miss High Lady of the Night Court over there is slowly taking down his court.A nightmare, I’d told Tamlin.Iwas the nightmare.I was kinda hoping for more telepathic interactions? I wanted Feyre to say something like, “Oh Rhys was just terrible to me.” and Rhys to just pop up and be like, “Terribly good in bed.” or something like that. But that never happened. SJM really threw away her shot.Hamilton would be disappointed.I’m going to be honest here. I didn’t really understand how Feyre took down the Spring Court? Like I know she did it by gaining the people’s trust. But I didn’t understand that sunlight scene or all the uneventful trips to the wall. Also Ianthe didn’t die in the first part which was disappointing. BUT IANTHE DOES GET HER HAND SMASHED INTO LITTLE PIECES BY FEYRE WHICH IS SO FREAKING BRUTAL I screamed the entire time like wow I don’t like the bitch either but did she really deserve to have her hand continuously smashed? I am a good person who has morals and part of me is still like “yeah she deserved that”Anyways Feyre is eventually like #byelosers @ the Spring Court and leaves. She takes Lucien with her which is really cool because Lucien deserved better than those assholes. So Lucien and Feyre flee the Spring Court, which at this point is burning.In fact I have an actual, never before seen picture of the spring court taken shortly after Feyre leftSome stuff happens and there\'s fighting because it’s a high fantasy novel and not having any fighting would probably make it a contemporary or something. But anyhow, Cassian eventually comes and helps Feyre and Lucien with the fighting. And the Cassian/Feyre reunion is the best reunion in this book? Like what Feyre/Rhys reunion?I met those laughing, fierce hazel eyes.Cassian’s smile softened. “Hello, Feyre.""My throat tightened to the point of pain, and I threw my arms around his neck, embracing him tightly.“I missed you, too,” Cassian murmured, squeezing me.Honestly, that scene was the absolute best? Like after that, the Feysand reunion was so underwhelming. It happened just a few pages later but it wasn’t cute dialogue and hugs and ***friendship*** Their meetup was crying on the floor then having unnecessary explicit sex.SJM is great and all, but her sex scenes are the worst. I understand that sex is a thing that exist and Feysand participates in it, but I just don’t care about the details. I would rather have more Amren dialogue.So at one point during all this reunion sex, Feyre tells Rhys that he likes a dramatic entrance which has just won an oscar for “understatement of the year”. Because obviously, Rhys did not crash Feyre’s wedding in ACOMAFThe next part of the book is just like plotting and stuff. It’s kind of boring. I honestly almost fell asleep during the next two hundred pages? I mean I didn’t though because this is a SJM book but I could have. There was no action. No suspense. At least I had Amren and her I-don’t-give-a-shit attitude to keep me awake.There is the library scene which is the worst scene in the entire book. So Feyre and Rhys are in this gigantic ass library surrounded by books which is like life goals right? If you don’t want to be surrounded by books then gtfo of my review. But anyways, instead of appreciating the luxuries they have in their life, Feyre and Rhys spend the entire time flirting with each other? This annoyed me so much. It was the most unrealistic scene in this entire series. I don’t care if my High Lord mate was there with me. If I was in a library surrounded by books, then he doesn’t freaking exist in that moment.Also there is a giant monster thing that lives in the basement of this library that everyone is afraid of? #goals“If you hadn’t stolen my bride away in the night, Rhysand, I would not have been forced to take such drastic measures to get her back.”I said quietly, “The sun was shining when I left you.”So Rhys and Feyre and the rest of the squad decided to throw a party. By party I mean, they decided to get all the incredibly powerful, opinionated fae in one place and try to come to an agreement. This is such a smart idea. Just wow. They also invite Tamlin to be nice and then they act surprised when he shows up??? Like you guys sent him an invite to your birthday party??? It would be rude of him not to come???? Why would he turn down free cake like that?!?!?!Tarquin took him in. Then me. And the others. “I rescind the blood rubies. Let there be no debts between us.”“Don’t expect Amren to return hers,” Cassian muttered. “She’s grown attached to it.”So the greatest thing ever happened during this meeting? And I’m not talking about when Feyre destroyed Tamlin when he was being a prick. No, I’m talking about how Amren isn’t returning her ruby that marks her for death? She’s so iconic. I want to be Amren when I grow up.Then, while all these high lords were in the same place and wasting time fighting with each other,donald trumpthe King ofHybitchHyburn brings down the wall that they were all tryingnot sodesperately to protect. And again, they were all surprised.Like are you fUCKing kidding me? How did you not see this coming???? You are standing around, doing pratically nothing. Wasting all the time in the world. AND YO UARE SUPRISED THAT HYBITCH IS ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH WITH HIS PLANS. YOU KNOW HE WAS TRYING TO BRING THAT WALL DOWN. he WAS GONNA DO IT AND YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY WAS THE PERFECT OPPURTUNITY. Honestly, I am surprised he didn’t succeed earlier than this?So noW that the wall has been destroyed and is never coming back, all these high lords realized that if they are going to win this war, they are gonna all get off their asses to do something.Also what even are we fighting for? All I know about this war is that the King of Hyburn is bad and the Night Court Squad is good. How did this war even start? What did Amarantha have to do with anything? Who even is Myriam person and what does she have to do with anything? I know it was probably explained in ACOMAF but that was a year ago and I was too busy placing my attention on Rhys to pay any attention. So at this point I’m 469 pages into the last book of this trilogy and I don’t even know what we are fighting for? I’m emotionally invested in a war I know nothing about. Is this what politics are like?Anyways, the squad and their newly found high lord allies go to take down Hybitch.So then Feyre has this brilliant idea to go find out good friend the Suriel. I forgot the Suriel even existed tbh. He’s so creepy that I am sure my brain purposely block him out from my ACOTAR memories. So we go find Mr. Suriel and he is near the Weaver’s cottage.I also blocked the weaver out from my memories so, if you are like me, this is when you bust open your ACOTAR coloring book, flip to the picture of the Weaver, and then pretend to remember.So the Suriel is kinda helpful but unhelpful as always. But Feyre still cares about him becasue why would’t you care about the creepy monster that doesn’t even have a proper name and you\'ve only met like three times? So Suriel, that unhelpful yoda, is in the middle of giving Feyre vague advice when THAT BITCH IANTHE SHOWS UP AND JUST SHOOTS HIM WITH AN ARROW FOR NO GOOD REASON. Obviously having a crushed hand hasn’t affected her aim any.Someone should just kill that bitch already. Which is exactly what Feyre does. And she isn’t even easy on her. She takes Ianthe into the Weaver’s cottage and the weaver like eats her. Gross. I would have atleast chosen a less graphic demise. And something that kills her a lot longer.How fortunate are we that we caught the impossible-to-catch Suriel for the third time right near the cottage of a monster thing that likes to eat bitches? We are soooo fortunate.“Feyre Archeron,” the Suriel said again, gazing at the leafy canopy, the sky peeking through it. A painful inhale. “A request.”I leaned close. “Anything.”Another rattling breath. “Leave this world...a better place than how you found it.”So after murdering Ianthe, Feyre goes back to the dying Suriel and I haveThe Hunger Gamesflashbacks to Rue’s death scene. I was kind of expecting Feyre to gather flowers to place around the Suriel. And obviously, even though we are in a world surrounded by magic, there is no way to save the Suriel. He dies. I’m devastated. You are devastated. I still vaguely remember the Suriel from the past two books.And if I’m honest, this all could have been avoided if Feyre wasn’t so dramatic and just asked the Suriel to coffee or something.Oh also, I just happened to have stumbled upon this picture of Feyre that was taken one time after someone was shocked she caught the SurielMore stuff I don’t care about happens blah blah blah and then Feyre’s sister, Elain, is somehow kidnapped by the cauldron.Also making a cauldron the most powerful object in all the universe is the stupidest thing I’ve ever read.How did the Cauldron kidnap Elain? I don’t know it is never really explained how that inanimate object does anything. Remember, I still don’t know why the crap we are at war here. Anyways, Feyre gets really upset so she goes undercover as Ianthe and infiltrates the Hyburn army and saves Elain. Feyre goes through maybe one obstacle along the way and then returns to her mate Rhys.Also, if you are a person who participates in drinking games, then here’s a fun one for you while you read the book. Every time the word “mate” is said you drink. And get drunk during the first chapter. You\'ll be in the hospital by the third chapter. So actually don’t play that drinking game.And was I the only person who felt this entire thing was so unneeded? This is a 700 page book and we are nearing the end and now we are going on missions that run a little too smoothly? Like I know Azriel gets hurt but he’ll heal perfectly fine because we live in a world of healing magic that works on bat wings but not bitch’s hands.More fighting. There is a lot of fighting that happens. It’s like they are at war or something.Oh remember Feyre’s father? Yeah, I don’t either. But he comes back. I didn’t know he was gone but he came back with ships named after his daughters and Odette fromSwan Lakebut instead of a Swan, she’s a firebird which might just be a stupid name for a phoenix, oh and he name isn’t Odette. Anyways, her father finds this queen they just happened to be looking for even though there’s no way he could have possibly known that because he has been missing for 37297843 years. So obviously, because of this all his past sins are forgiven instantly. Then her father eventually dies because ofTrumpHybitch and we are suppose to be sad about it but I’m still standing here likeThen, on page 666, because Sarah is in fact the devil, the unthinkable happens. MY BABY RHYS WHO IS SUPPOSE TO BE PROTECTED AT ALL TIMES DIES. YES DIES. AND AT THIS POINT I’M CRYING IN THE CORNER AND WANTING TO THROW THE BOOOK INTO A VOLCANOAnd I’m just like, “If he ficking stays dead then at least all 700 pages of this book will make great kindling to warm my now cold heart”But then I remember ACOTAR and how Feyre here died and then was brought back to life so I start looking at the other high lords who happen to be near us at this moment and I’m just “Hey do a girl a favor here AND BRING BACK MY BOYFRIEND.”But then I also remember there’s a certain asshole who is also a high lord who has to help and I Start FREAKING out but then he comes through and he’s just like “Be happy, Feyre,” and SAVES RHY’S LIFEYou still an asshole Tam, but maybe just a little bit less.ANd I’m just crying in the corner even harder than before.Then somehow they defeat the King of Hybitch and Feyre and Rhys live happily ever after. Both are alive. The #NightSquad is still alive. Beause that is super realistic.Looks like the only person who is dead here is me. Oh well.CONCLUSIONSo while ACOMAF is still the best, this is still a great novel and I loved it? Being with all my children again is all I have ever asked for in life and I \'m just glad that they all ended up happy.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '4.8/5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️“Only you can decide what breaks you, Cursebreaker. Only you.”Let me talk to you about this book. This bookKILLED ME. This bookDESTROYED ME. This bookANNIHILATED ME. This bookOBLITERATED ME. This bookELIMINATED ME. This bookWIPED ME OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH. This bookEXTERMINATED ME. This bookERADICATED ME. I will never recover. How can I function after this fucking book? I was supposed to read it slowly becauseA Court of Frost and Starlightwill arrive here after a week and I have had serious issues waiting for those books in the past, but I couldn\'t stop. The last 300 pages were marvelous, they gripped me by the balls and took me with them on this amazing journey. I was reading till6amyesterday. No regrets. The feels are always heightened this ungodly time of day. And I\'m so happy I read this book at that time. But let\'s start from the very beginning.Looming war threatens all Feyre holds dear in the third volume of the #1 New York Times bestselling A Court of Thorns and Roses series.Feyre has returned to the Spring Court, determined to gather information on Tamlin\'s manoeuvrings and the invading king threatening to bring Prythian to its knees. But to do so she must play a deadly game of deceit – and one slip may spell doom not only for Feyre, but for her world as well.As war bears down upon them all, Feyre must decide who to trust amongst the dazzling and lethal High Lords – and hunt for allies in unexpected places.This book started off strong enough. I was extremely excited about Feyre infiltrating Tamlin\'s Court and taking him down. She would be such a badass. I expected this part of the book to be bigger, to be honest. About 250 pages, to be exact. I really enjoyed the scheming, the planning, the cleverness of Feyre, how she turned everyone against one another so brilliantly. I hated Tamlin and Ianthe more in this part of the book, obviously. They were both manipulative, controlling and toxic. They truly deserved each other. Lucien gained some respect from me in this part of the book. I was really disappointed in him inA Court of Mist and Fury.Afterwards, the pace of the book gets a bit slower than I would have wanted. I expected it to happen, because the ""format"" of these books is always the same, for me at least. A very powerful beginning, then the pace lags a little bit and in the end the trueBAM! But it was different for me in this book. I didn\'t feel the same excitement its predecessor gave me (till page 400). And I understand why. The previous book opened up a whole entire different world to me. From the Spring Court and everything we thought we knew was right, everything changed. And we start off getting to know everything in the Night Court, and it was all exhilarating. As much and even more as it was getting to know the entire world of everything in the first book. Getting to know Rhysand and his true incentives, the inner circle, the world, seeing the romance bloom between Rhysand and Feyre. In this book, everything is settled. We know everyone, the world, the romance is stable. There aren\'t as many new things happening, except when we get to page 400. Till this page, I would have given this book 4 stars, which is low for this series for me, because I LIVE FOR IT.I\'m going to talk a bit about the first 400 pages, before my favorite part of the book starts. After Feyre arrived in the Night Court with Lucien, everything took a certain pace. We got to feel Velaris again, the inner circle, Rhysand, the conflict, the problems. A gargantuan War is coming, and they had to deal with it. Gather allies, forge a plan, make actions, bargains. This entire chunk of the book was about the war and how they would end it. And I truly enjoyed that but it didn\'t keep me on my toes, you know? Till page 400.PAGE 400. THAT\'S WHERE THE REAL SHIT STARTS. And then we got to page 400. When the meeting starts. This is the part I couldn\'t leave the book down. The part where if anyone commanded me to leave the book down, I would have killed them. Like fucking Feyre would. This meeting was so enthralling. The tension was keeping me enraptured the entire time. I\'m content that we got to know the other High Lords of Prythian, we got a better understand of the world and its people. They were all truly incredible characters (except Beron), especially Helion. I loved his humor, his swag and that he\'s bisexual. I noticed something very important in this book. There was more representation. Not enough but more. We got to see black characters, bisexual characters, gay characters, lesbian characters (MOR I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, I\'M SO PROUD OF YOU GIRL). This series isn\'t known for its diversity, but it was nice to see some more examples popping up. It was refreshing.But anyway, let\'s continue with the meeting. I was so proud of all my Night Court babies, how they handled it. Each question a challenge that was met brilliantly.IF I COULD I WOULD STAND UP AND APPLAUD AZRIEL FOR ATTACKING ERIS. FUCKING ERIS.And also my Queen Feyre, who showed her true powers without fear of the High Lords. Of so many High Lords, who could easily kill her. And then Tamlin enters the Dawn Court room. I thought there was a limit to how much I hated him, but he surpassed that. His crude, distasteful and inappropriate comments were so unnecessary. Dude, we know how fucking butthurt you are that your girlfriend left you for a better man than you, but we\'re here to discuss how to prevent the War, your comments are fucking irrelevant. Be a better man for once and show some restraint. Now wonder even Lucien left you. Lucien. Oh man. Helion is Lucien\'s father. I was so fucking astonished. This book bestowed many plot twists for us, and this was one that gripped me tightly. I don\'t even know the reason, I just really like Lucien all of a sudden. More than I liked him in the first book. And I genuinely appreciated how he trusted Feyre, and how he acclimated himself to the Night Court. How he saw good in Rhysand and his people, after all the propaganda of the latest hundreds of years. How he wanted to be useful and help do something significant for the War.I WANT TO DISCUSS HOW FEYRE IS SUCH A SHIPPER, IT HURTS. Feyre is like us. She ships her friends with each other and tries to make the ship happen. I\'m so proud of her. I\'m so proud that she actively participates in her friend\'s happiness. She ships everything I ship, and I couldn\'t not notice it, it\'s so obvious. I want her to succeed. I want her to find the best fucking girlfriend for Mor, cause my girl deserves happiness. They all deserve it, but her more, in the relationship factor. I\'m very sorrowful that in this world, a lesbian woman can\'t thrive. It mirrors our own world, to be exact. Some people have the resources and the family behind to support them, and some people just, don\'t. Mor has been so unlucky in the romance department, with her cruel family stopping everything that she does. I want her to come out, and I want Feyre to be beside her and support her.I WANT TO TALK ABOUT NESTA AND CASSIAN. NESTA AND CASSIAN. The ship I was rooting for since the previous book. The ship that is killing my heart slowly and painfully.THEY HAVE TO BE MATES. PLEASE TELL ME THEY\'RE MATES. And even if they\'re not, their dynamic is so strong. Their scenes so utterly powerful, even them staring at each other had me dying in my seat. I want them to thrive. They are my favorite couple, after Rhysand and Feyre, and I want them to prosper. There was such a gradual progress with them. Sarah handled this couple\'s dynamic amazingly. How we started seeing, little by little, how Nesta started caring more about Cassian. How gentle he was with her, with her feelings. He didn\'t push her, he didn\'t drive her to the edge. I want more of them, I want them to take over the world. Nesta is such a favorite character of mine. Strong, unyielding, snarky, flawed, raw, true. She is perfectly flawed, the way I like my characters to be. This book series doesn\'t favor flawed characters. Most of them are impeccable, outside and inside. But Nesta isn\'t. She still shows her humanity and I love her for it.We talked about Nesta... now we have to talk about Elain. Useless, needless Elain. I didn\'t like her in this book. I loathed her moping around, her extremely extravagant sensitivity, her outmost obsolescence. I couldn\'t stand everyone defending and protecting her, all the fucking time. Oh poor little Elain, how bad must it be for you to be immortal, young and beautiful forever, aw I feel so sorry for you. She didsomethingin the end by stabbing The Hybern King, but not something miraculous. Nesta integrated the action. I just didn\'t enjoy her character in this book, she was utterly annoying to me.This War man... this War. It was the most tit gripping thing I have read in a very long time. The adrenaline was high up in heaven. It was jaw dropping, breathtaking, awe-inspiring. When the hope was lost, there would be hope, and when there was hope, it would be taken harshly out of our grip. There was so much shit happening, so many characters appearing, to help, to condemn. Strategies being thrown our the window, plans succeeding, failing, bargains breaking. There was just.. so much happening. I couldn\'t keep track of everything. The action was astounding, the plot twists out of this world, the thrill spectacular. I devoured these chapters in a heartbeat. I wasn\'t even looking at the pages or chapters, or even time, I was just reading. This book was a true and amazing ending to an incredible series. I\'m so happy I picked these books up. This series made me love fantasy again. I have stopped being a fan of fantasy for many many years, and these books reintroduced me to its virtues.I WANT TO READ MORE FANTASY BECAUSE OF THESE BOOKS YEAH.RHYS\'S DEATH GUYS. It happened in page666, how convenient. I didn\'t feel a heartbeat for a minute. I know he would survive because he\'s in the next book, but you know how it is. I was utterly heartbroken by Feyre\'s reaction. She made me feel what she was feeling. I cried. Literally. And hear me out a bit. This is a huge deal for me. I never cry with books. The only books I have ever cried about are theHarry Potterseries and theOutlanderseries. Which are my all time favorite books of all the fucking universe. When I started crying, I was so surprised at myself. I was so happy I did. Because Rhys has become one of my all time favorite characters, and seeing his demise broke me. Like Feyre\'s heart was broken. And then Tamlin gives his last speck of light and saves him. Let\'s talk about him and his redemption arc.You have seen my feelings about him in the fist part of this review. In the end, they shifted, just a bit. I truly appreciated how he helped Feyre, how he saved her. And how he saved Rhysand\'s life. I don\'t like him, but I value how he got over his grudge, and actually helped everyone, for the good of Prythian. I forgive you, Tamlin, you\'re still a piece of shit of a character with many unsolved issues, but as Feyre said“I hope you find happiness, too.\'""And I did. Not just for what he\'d done for Rhys, but...Even for an immortal, there was not enough *time* in life to waste it on hatred. On feeling it and putting it into the world.So I wished him well -- I truly did, and hoped that one day...One day, perhaps he would face those insidious fears, that destructive rage rotting away inside him.”You get a pass, bitch. I\'m curious of what will happen to his relationship with Lucien. It will be interesting.I have written 12000 words for this review. And 8000 are left. I will surpass Goodread\'s character limit. Lmao. I had so much to say about this book, the ending of a marvelous series. I couldn\'t help myself and I\'m very sorry for this chaos of a review. My feels are still raw and unedited. And if you\'re reading this right now, you\'re a true hero for going through all of this shittone. And I love you for it.To sum it all up, this book was a truly magnificent journey and an incredible ending to a wonderful series. I\'m literally speechless, and I will think about this book a lot. For a very long time. Nothing else more I can say, this review explains it all. I will crawl now to my bed and die peacefully of the feels. And till the next one... K BYE!7500 characters left out of 20000.LMFAO.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5/5 ✧･ﾟ: *""I would have waited five hundred more years for you. A thousand years.""This was the easiest 5 stars of my life, and for sure my favourite book in the series. I wish I could attach the video of me hysterically crying. I felt so much for this story, world and characters. So many things like tugged my heart strings, whilst being whimsical at the same time. I laughed and cried - this was just sooooo good. Getting into fantasy is really hard sometimes but this made it so easy. ⋆˙⟡♡╰┈➤PlotI think this book is a lot more plot focused than ACOMAF. They\'re dealing with strained political bonds with a devastating war on the horizon. It was so cool to see the other courts and all their personalities, how they all had their own stories that tie in with our main characters. As a certified romance hater, this was much more my style. There is stilla lotof romance to swoon for, between multiple characters and it was just *chef\'s kiss*.I will not stop talking about found family - these moments were responsible for me crying my eyes out.╰┈➤CharactersPersonally,Feyrewas a lot more likeable in this book. Less whining, more protective sister, protective family member. She\'s still not perfect and buts her nose into situations which I feel like she shouldn\'t, but it didn\'t make me dislike her, it\'s just a flaw. She has some very epic and real adventurous moments in this, and her anointment asHigh Lady of the Night Courtonly made me like her more.Rhysand, what a sweetheart. I love him to bits, he\'s soft on the inside but a bit of a powerful arrogant cheeky guy on the outside. He\'s sooooo sweet to Feyre and as someone who loveswords of affirmationI found him so loveable. He loves his family so deeply and that is represented further in this book. I loveCassianmore though. He\'s like a man man, also my style, but has a very soft spot for a girl. So adorable.BothNestaandElainmade me fall in love with them. They\'re so different, and they developed differently during this story, but the outcome was still the same. Nesta was starting to get on my nerves at one point because she\'s a bitice coldbut it grows on you, as it grows on a particular Illyrian warrior. I love the fact that they both have a special power that contributes to their overall adventure/mission. I\'m so excited to see them more in the next book. 𓍢ִ໋🌷͙֒╰┈➤World/SettingListen - this world was beautifully painted. The characters in this were painted so vividly, I could imagine each of them and they were all beautiful. As we see a lot more of the different courts, we see how different they are, both in attitude and visual representation, which was so well done. I could see Autumn court, Summer court, Winter court, Day & Dawn, and it\'s just so cool. I can\'t decide which one I would like to live in more, but I\'m leaning towards Winter.╰┈➤PacingSomething was always happening, there was always something to be interested in, laugh at, or cry at. There were some really tense moments at the ends of chapters that kept me hooked and this is a looooong book (703 pages). My ADHD struggled at times, but that doesn\'t reflect the story.╰┈➤EnjoymentAs you probably can tell, I enjoyed this so much. Like so so much. I felt the characters, was invested in the story, kept wanting to read it. Personally the story had everything I wanted, found family, epic battles and high stakes. So good.╔═════ ❀•°❀°•❀ ═════╗score card:plot: 5/5characters: 5/5world/setting: 5/5pacing: 5/5enjoyment: 5/5total: 5/5ੈ✩‧₊˚╚═════ ❀•°❀°•❀ ═════╝₊˚⊹♡ reading log09/05 9:30am ୨ৎgod damn I hate tamlin so much I hate the spring court so much what a sad sad man09/05 6:53am ୨ৎazriel and mor are positively killing me08/05 6:50am ୨ৎdid i get up at 6am to keep reading this? yes. is something awful about to go down in the story? yes.07/05 8:10pm ୨ৎi love this world, i love reading about these characters i love them all in their own unique way - but MAN this is long and my adhd cannot handle it - azriel is my favourite character so far, nesta\'s coldness is getting a little on my nerves but I\'m sure its for a reason07/05 4:31pm ୨ৎnesta be like 🥶🥶🥶05/05 8:35pm ୨ৎoh good i\'ve already cried, found family is my biggest weakness i can\'t05/05 6:44pm ୨ৎgod this book is long so much has happened and im only 13% of the way in05/05 12:02pm ୨ৎtamlin is stupid₊˚⊹♡ pre-readingit\'s tiimmeeeeee!! i\'ve been DYING to know how this is going to play out i\'m so excited the last one had me in an emotional ball on the floor - i expect nothing less from this one (although i know the second one is most people\'s favourite).i\'m so excited to see more of nesta and elain!! and of course everyone\'s favourite book boyfriend, rhysand.✦\u3000\u3000\u3000.\u3000\u3000. \u3000\u2008˚\u3000.\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 . ✦\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000˚\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 . ★⋆..\u2002\u2002 \u3000\u3000˚\u3000✭\u3000 \u3000\u3000*\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000✦\u3000\u3000\u3000.\u3000\u3000.\u3000\u3000\u3000✦\u3000˚ \u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u2008˚\u3000.˚\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000✭\u3000.\u3000\u3000. \u3000\u2008˚\u3000.\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 ✦may tbr:ಇ.salt to the seaಇ. powerlessಇ. house of earth and bloodಇ. everyone in my family has killed someoneಇ. brideಇ. listen for the lieಇ. she\'s not sorryಇ. love on the brainಇ. the familiarಇ.a court of wings and ruin'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""symptoms - sweaty palms, increased heart rate, calling everyone'mate.'diagnosis - rhysand withdrawals.treatment - rereading this book.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'A Court of Wings and Ruinis the third book in the ACOTAR series by Sarah J. Maas, and it\'s wild. The book starts with Feyre spying on the Spring Court for Rhys, pretending to be Tamlin\'s faithful wife again so she can undermine his Court from the inside.I absolutely adored the first part of the book. I love how clever Feyre was, setting up the destruction of the Spring Court while no one knew what she was planning. The way she tricked Tamlin was gold.After she returns to the Night Court, war breaks out between Hybern and Prythian. She goes on a quest to find the Cauldron, an ancient source of magic that might just stop the war. But not all of the Courts are willing to help her, and she will have to call on other magical creatures and forces to aid her in her search.I didn\'t like this part of the book as much. It felt very aimless to me, and drawn out for so long that the plot points lost all meaning. I wasn\'t bored, exactly, but the plot just feltwrongto me, as if something were missing. It was pretty straightforward in the beginning—find the Cauldron, destroy Hybern—but then a bunch of subplots were introduced. Feyre had to make deals with spirits and gods, she had to avoid Hybern—it was just... a lot, and yet too little at the same time. What do I mean by ""too little?"" Well...The pacing was dreadful. That doesn\'t mean I was bored.The plot built up far too quickly. Unlike inThrone of Glass,where the plot built gradually and climaxed in KoA, the plot here came out of nowhere. The villain, the King of Hybern, was so one-dimensional and uninteresting. His motives didn\'t make sense, the little history that was thrown in was so random and didn\'t help make him a better character at all, and his death was so unsatisfying. The character who killed him... well, I\'m not going to spoil it, but I don\'t think they were the right character to do the job. See the spoilery section for more on that.This series would have been better as just a regular romance, without all this...plot.I only really cared about the Inner Circle anyway. If it were just a faerie romance with great side characters and a found family, I would. Not. Care. That\'s all I want. Adding a whole epic plotline to the story just drags it down. I much preferred the more introspective ACOMAF.I really, really loved Feyre in ACOMAF, and now? Not so much. She has too many powers. She can do everything the High Lords can and more. I love how she\'s the first High Lady, but honestly, she has every power and it gets annoying when she can do basically anything.However, there are still times when I like Feyre more than Aelin. She\'s more mild and less overbearing, and I like that in a protagonist. She\'s persistent when she needs to be, and determined to learn. She understands the meaning of responsibility.Rhys before the mating bond is superior to Rhys after the mating bond. For one, he was less protective in the beginning of ACOMAF versus ACOWAR. I\'m tired of overprotective, aggressive male characters. I miss the Rhysand of ACOMAF, the one with a sharp sense of humor and patient respect for Feyre. He still has some of the traits he exhibited earlier, but they\'re dimmed in the face of his overpoweringmaleness that can sometimes turn into toxic masculinity. Thank you, next.🚨🚨🚨SPOILERS AHEAD, PROCEED WITH CAUTION🚨🚨🚨Elain killed the King of Hybern and I am angry.She\'s incapable of doing anything useful and everyone, including the other characters, consistently forgets she exists. How am I supposed to believe she sneaked up behind the big baddie and stabbed him? How is she the hero here? Okay, maybe this is her big moment, when she overcomes her fear and does something awesome, but... where\'s the buildup?I have a theory that NoBrain Elain is actually whip-smart and pretends to be meek and helpless just to manipulate everyone around her. And I have evidence.1. One of Elain\'s only lines of dialogue is, ""I hope they all burn in hell."" And everyone is shocked because she likes gardens and flowers and she hardly ever talks so they all think she\'s weak. But what if this is just Elain\'s true side showing through?2. She holds all of the characters in the palm of her hand. Nesta is obsessed with protecting her. Azriel is in love with her. Feyre will do anything to save her when she gets captured, and so Rhys likes her too just because Feyre does. They risked all of their lives just to sneak into Hybern\'s camp and save her, despite the fact that she has done nothing useful this entire book. What if she\'s manipulating them all, using them for her own gain?That\'s my wild theory. Have fun with it.At the end of the book, Amren sacrifices herself to destroy Hybern. This had the potential to be a really powerful, touching moment. But no. She got brought back from the dead because no one EVER dies in fantasy books. And this makes me mad. Her sacrifice lost all of its pain because there were literally no consequences.🚨🚨🚨SPOILERS HAVE ENDED🚨🚨🚨NoBrain ElainWritten by SofiaNoBrain Elain puts me in painHer stupid shenanigans make me mad againShe\'s a pointless character who does nothingBut add to my unending sufferingShe never talks, but everyone loves herMaybe it\'s trauma, but I still sufferShe gets into trouble and everyone criesI just smile and hope she diesShe belongs with Tamlin, that much is trueIf she ends with Azriel, I will sueNesta may be angering, but at least she\'s not thisI would banish Elain from this earth with my last wishElain, ElainNoBrain ElainNobody cares about your painThis may sound harsh, but rest assuredThe whole book community thinks you\'re absurd3.5 starsACOTAR reviewACOMAF reviewcredit'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'You know you\'re a dedicated fan when you mark an untitled book set to release in 2017 as a ""want to read"".

Maaswiped that sneer off my face and proved me wrong. Again.A Court of Wings and Ruinis a work of art that will make you run out of proper adjectives to describe all the pandemonium, magic and apocalypse it entails. The kind that will pull at your heartstrings right from the get-go and hold you with its sharp claws, imploring you to devour it.Intense action, delicious romance, backstabbing, ferociously deadly creatures, raw brutality, lies and disguise are all ornately woven into a tale that will cocoon you into the Fae world and soothe you, leaving you anchored by nothing but a tempest in your lungs.There was darkness and light, storm and calm, despair but also hope. You will see battles mired with savagery and viciousness, harsh and regrettable decisions and nerve-wracking adventures in a world where humans are perceived as weak and easily destroyable.Sarah J. Maas's world building is so exquisite that I felt detached from my own body, incapable of focusing on anything else happening around me, only flipping the pages with an acute yearning of what's about to happen. She delivers plenty of magic and mayhem, with a knack for perfect pacing of the story and character reflection.CharactersThe Inner Circle, my favourite squad ❤I love their devotion to each other. Their ability to be kind in spite of harsh circumstances, their ability to love despite enduring a millenia of cruelty. They're all so full of light, it makes we want to smile and simultaneously tear up at their unconditional loyalty. I was so attached to them, like I was bound to them by an invisible, irrevocable tether. When they struggled, I struggled. When they were hurt, I was hurt. I could feel their rage, loyalty and honour coursing through my veins, like a shrieking void.High LordsI don't think I would have enjoyed this book at all if not for them. I'm glad thatSarah J. Maasshowed them in a new light, something readers haven't seen in the previous books.As amusing as their banter was, I also feel deeply moved by their actions, their unwavering faith in one another during the battle despite their iffy past.Be itHelion,the Spell Cleaver;Thesan,the healer;Tarquin,the sympathetic and thoughtful leader;Kallias,the snow/ice manipulator andBeron,..... Never mind, I didn't really like him; I loved them with every echoing heartbeat. (Beron being the exception)\u200eOh andTamlin. I apologise if I've been harsh to him after readingA Court of Mist and Fury, but I have a new found respect for him. Despite his impropriety initially, the fact that he finally rises to be a better man by not dwelling on petty vengeance and retribution hit me in the gut and made my eyes burn with warm tears.WhereA Court of Mist and Furywas romance heavy (not that I'm complaining),A Court of Wings and Ruinwas action-packed and was cluttered with twists and magical intrigue and SJM definitely didn't let the romance aspect of the book obliterate the subplot, deftly exploring all the details.I feel weighed down by the intensity of this composition and I vow never to let it slip even from the deepest clutches of my mind ❤""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '4.75!""Night Triumphant- and the Stars Eternal.”I might be in the minority here but I liked ACOWAR more than ACOMAF but this has only happened during this reread before this reread the four times that I read this series I always preferred ACOMAF maybe because I loved the romance but reading this now really made me appreciate the plot and the politics in this book. This book was exactly 700 pages long and 700 pages have never felt this short because I actually flew through them and despite rereading this series every year there were still moments where I forgot certain things happen and the plot twists surprised me as well, the way it was written made it very easy to read a 700 paged book.“I see all of you, Rhys. And there is not one part that I do not love with everything I am.”FeyreI feel like Feyre is very underrated, her cunningness is overshadowed a lot by the fandom because of how compassionate she is because in this because people really rave about how cunning she was and how she made a fool out of the spring court and hey, believe me I loved that scene to probably me best part in this book but then I looked back and saw that Feyre has always been this clever and she made it till this book because of how smart she was and I just feel like its very underappreciated. I love her.“You do not fear... You do not falter. You do not yield.”RhysandI really like Rhys\'s character bur he is probably my least favorite bat boy lol. I liked him, he made rash decisions some I understood, some I did not but in the end it all worked out well. I love how cocky he was and how he presented himself with this calm composure and IDGAF attitude and I also like how he was actually nice and not a total bitch, how he helped everyone and would do anything for the people he loved. The romance between Feyre and Rhys was good as well and I liked how well it was managed in the span of three books.“We\'re all a broken, in our own ways - In places no one might see.”The Inner CircleAmren as always was the character I loved and my heart was beating so fast during those final pages because if ykyk, Cassian, him and Nesta in this book ATE and I loved him. Mor, I was justice for her, I need answers, I love her but I also want to know more about her because we only know bits and pieces about her past and nothing more and finally Azriel, I love that man so much, everything that he said and did was beautiful.“Only you can decide what breaks you, Cursebreaker. Only you.”I think the plot, the entire build up and how it all paid off was really well done and the action sequences were also detailed and really well written, The court intrigue was also something I appreciated. Especially that highlords meeting (prolly my favorite scene) and the bargains that were made, the satisfying endings that we got, the reunions and all of the massive forces aligning together with twists that you won\'t see coming and it was just really good as for the world building I am stunned how it still grew and morphed into something more beautiful.Overall, a really solid conclusion to this series and while tog remains superior, this series will have a special place in my heart!!____Listening to the graphic audio just so I can hear the loml Az say""Be careful of how you speak of my high lady""🤭Reread #4'}]"

i went into this book blindly and had no idea what to expect with this story, and to say, im so glad i did bc i was pleasantly astounded by what unfolded.. the hype surrounding this book is very much justified. this was an enchanting story, i just adored watching roman and iris find love through a magical connection. their love was so tender and emotionally raw.➷ this story weaves an enthralling tale of war and the blossoming romance intertwined within its turmoil. divine rivals unfolds within the world war I-esque setting, a raging war happening between two gods who are using humans as their troops to cause devastation. there are elements of trench warfare and the overall impacts of the loss through war. the descriptions were realistic and brutal.➷ the letters are no doubt the best part of this book, they were so intimate and i simply can’t get over them. the writing in each letter just had so much raw honesty and an undercurrent of longing. you could feel their emotions pour out of each letter!! they formed a connection through loss and grief and sought solace in one another through letters. rebecca ross has the most beautiful, poetic writing style ever, she is an expert in lyrical prose, it completely enchanted me—i absolutely adore the way she delicately crafts her words, it was so exquisitely beautiful.“if there’s anything i can should say in this moment when my heart is beating wildly in my chest and i would beg you to come and tame it—is this: your letters have been a light for me to follow. your words? a sublime feast that fed me on days when i was starving. i love you iris.”➳ this story follows iris winnow, an ambitious journalist who dropped out of school after her brother went off to war to fight for the goddess enva and she does her best to care for her alcoholic mother — she gets a job at a local, prestigious newspaper writing obituaries to earn money to pay the bills. after a devastating incident happens, iris packs up her life, leaves oath and travels 600km away to the front lines of the war to find her missing brother. she gets a job as a war correspondent and uncovers the harsh truths on the devastating war that is occurring. this is where the story truly comes alive as it explores the experience of trench warfare.iris is well-crafted character who is the easiest character to root for!! her vulnerability and struggles with abandonment and fear of never being good enough were tangible. she is very strong-willed, compassionate and empathetic — i adored how she always goes out of her way to help others were in need, befriends them and listens to what they have to say. she’s faced many challenges but she is still very earnest.➳ roman, charming and witty and the polar opposite to iris. he comes from a wealthy family and is much more privileged compared to iris but he wants to make his own way in life. but omggg i want this man for myself. the way he abandoned his family obligations and followed iris into the war zone bc he couldn’t bear the thought of being without her?! the way he loves iris so deeply and shows up for her every single time?? when he was in immense pain and couldn’t walk so he crawled just so he could reach her.. now that broke my heart into tiny lil pieces!!

I wouldn't change a thing.Does it end on a brutal cliffhanger?A BIG FAT YES. Am gonna be crying for days.In a slump after Fourth Wing?Grab this book.THIS IS YOUR SIGN TO BUY IT. IT IS WORTH THE MONEYYYYYYY'all can probably tell how much I loved this book. The people are not lying, this is worth the hype.✔️ Read if you like Shadow and Bone✔️ Historical fantasy romance✔️ Rivals to lovers✔️ Pen palsIris (FMC)andRoman (MMC)have been working and competing for the position of a columnist alongside each other at the local newspaper. There's no denying that there's spark between the two but can they overcome the rivalry as the war of gods loom over. Amidst the brutal war and magical creatures, finding solace in letters, in each other's company seems to fill them with hope and something more.Theworld buildingis not too complex, it might seem that way in the beginning but the author sets the stage brilliantly. Never info dumping, she paces the history of the towns, the platoons, the creatures and the gods-Enva and Dacrebeautifully. The typewriters sure are an interesting feature. It came so naturally and was so easy to read, love when authors do it right. Thepacingis consistent, not too fast not too slow. I was so mesmerized by her writing, the story and the characters, I was envisioning it all and didn't know where the time went.One of the underrated things is the way the author dealt with heavy topics-war, grief and loss of lifeplay a big part in this book. So if any of the things feel uncomfortable, do reconsider as it is a very emotional book. The way it's depicted and the sheer raw emotion written wasbeautifully heartbreaking to read.There were side characters who were just there for a few pages but they made me cry. They made an impact. The words they carried were powerful.Thecharactersmade this story so amazing.💠Iris-She is such an interesting and lovable FMC. Although she is just 18 but there's so much maturity to her. The way we see her struggles, battling emotions and presenting a tough exterior for her brother, for her mother and whoever close to her- is commendable. The way she is ready to protect others and put others first is beautiful to see.✒️Roman-I loved him from page 1 itself. A 19 year old with zeal. A bit grumpy in the beginning but there are reasons for that. The way he was dead set on doing anything and everything for Iris 🤌 The way he was never shy to show love. The way he was never held Iris back. The way he fell for her ❤️\u200d🔥 He is full of charms and wit and ready to be with Iris no matter what.Need me a Roman 😭His story about Del made me sob NGL.Thesupporting charactersare a nice addition to Iris and Roman's and the gods story. I likedAttiea lot and am sure I will love Lilac too. I likedMarisoland her 'mom energy' andKeegantoo however short a while we see her for.Forestis sure an interesting character and I won't elaborate on it further due to spoilers. Y'all but I really want to seeSarahachieve her dream 😭Theromancewas PERFECT 🤌 It's so deliciously sweet and swoon worthy, I fell in love with their love. The chemistry is present right from the beginning. I loved how both of them are so into each other and especially Roman, who is never afraid to show it. The sweet spicy moment in a YA book was beautiful to read. I loved how their relationship developed and grew stronger and stronger.Theendingabsolutely broke me. I knew something would go wrong but had no idea of the intensity of it. It was such a brutal cliffhanger and with the epilogue, am crying again just by thinking about it.I cannot recommend it enough y'all. Easily one of the best books I read this year. It's definitely going to be one of my favourites ever and I already cannot wait to reread it. Books like these make me realise why I love reading so much 🥺❤️ I honestly want to protect and cherish my copy of it.HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDGuys, just trust me.~•~•~LET'S GOOO 🙌🤞~•~•~Eep my copy just arrived and it is so beautiful. Cannot wait to get to it, have high hopes""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""How did the promise of a war between gods turn into a middling historical fiction with a lackluster romance and nary a whiff of fantasy? I'm honestly a bit stunned.I went intoDivine Rivalswith high expectations. I'd seen the gushing reviews and the deluge of 5-star ratings. And I'd gotten a taste for romantasy and I wanted more. In fact, I was so certain I was going to love this that I saved it for just the right moment when I'd need a little extra zing in my reading repertoire.So I settled myself in, ready to be swept away in a fantasy of epic proportions, with an enemies-to-lovers romance for the ages. And how can it not be amazing, with gods at war and two rivaling journalists who don't fight with their swords but with their words. Yes! Except no, because this didn't really deliver on any of it.Instead, what I got was more or less a historical fiction. The fantasy element is so diminutive, I felt like I could blink and miss it. You see, the gods were unhappy with each other, and they're recruiting humans to fight in their war. And that's pretty much it for the fantasy part. Oh, and there's some magic in old houses and typewriters. You can see how that would be disappointing for a reader expecting, well, more than that.The majority of the story is told from Iris's perspective and she never really gelled into an interesting character for me. At every step, she does what you would expect a character to do, nothing more, nothing less. Her brother is fighting in the war, so she misses him. She sees an opportunity to join the war effort, so she does. There's a cute boy at the office, so she's attracted to him. But there's another nice boy she writes with, so she's attracted to him too. At no point did she surprise me in any way. I found Roman to be the more compelling character, but his perspective is only a little bit here and there.As for the romance, it was serviceable but ultimately uninspiring. There was no real chemistry, no banter, no spark, nothing that made me swoon or crack a smile. The majority of it played out via Iris and Roman's letters to each other, and they felt distinctly YA. The writing was deep in the way of teenagers, but much ado about nothing for old folks like me. In fact, it reminded me of AOL chat logs from back in the day. I wonder if I were to dig up my own from my teenage days, it would come up similarly bland and overwrought.That isn't to say I didn't enjoy any of it because I did. But I kept waiting for that moment when the words I'm reading on the page would turn into an immersive experience, and it never did. Every element in here—the war, the fantasy, the characters, their writing, the romance—was pleasant enough to while away a few hours, but in that take it or leave it kind of way.No one's more disappointed than me. Compared to what I had imagined in my head, this story paled in comparison. But to be fair, part of that was my fault. What I wanted and what I got were complete opposites. I'm a huge fan of romance and fantasy, which this isn't really, and not a fan of wartime historical fiction, which is all this is.For all my complaints, I did get some enjoyment out of it. And since it's a duology and I already own the second book, I'll go ahead and finish the series. Fingers crossed that the second book has more of the exciting elements I'm looking for.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

I’m tired of having to rearrange my life after the people within it depart, as if I’m a puzzle and I’m now missing pieces and I will never feel that pure sense of completion again.”iris:incredible protagonist. the way she thinks, acts and speaks is so amazing, and her love for people she cares about is so so beautiful. also she is incredibly mature, the way she takes care of her drunk mother and works to keep them alive is so heartbreaking. she wears an armor everyday, hiding her family’s poverty, never asking for reassurance even though she feels alone in the world and trying to stand up on her own feet by working her ass of for a job she wants so passionately is so admirable. her seeking the truth at all costs, staying strong while her mom’s showing reckless actions, putting her family above her, not needing anyone and defending herself by her own, knowing her value, wanting to be beautiful just for herself, telling herself she doesn’t needs her mother’s reassurance but gets bolstered when gets it, not crying in front of people, hating when her boss made her resignation sounds like she is giving up, remembering small details about her friends, afraid to love people because she always lose them.. if i see someone saying she is unlikable, watch under your bed bc i’m hiding there.. with a knife 🔪”But if I’ve learned anything from those fools, it is that to be vulnerable is a strength that most of us fear. It takes courage to let down your armor, to welcome people to see you as you are. Sometimes I feel the same as you: I can’t risk having people behold me as I truly am. But there’s also a small voice in the back of my mind, a voice that tells me, ‘You will miss so much by being so guarded.”her mind is spectacular, she talks about how much she was hungry, not just for food but for sober conversations with her mother. and the way she uses words; she ‘bled’ herself in her articles and letters, not having motivation and describing the blank page as ‘nothing more than stars and smoke and word pressed on a page’, her writing to roman but also writingfor herself, her understanding how close she can be to people, yet how far away and lonely she can fell.. she is so mature and i get chills every time we get a scope of her articles and letters.“I don’t think you realize how strong you are, because sometimes strength isn’t swords and steel and fire, as we are so often made to believe. Sometimes it’s found in quiet, gentle places. The way you hold someone’s hand as they grieve. The way you listen to others. The way you show up, day after day, even when you are weary or afraid or simply uncertain. That is strength, and I see it in you.”roman:how to put this man’s selflessness, maturity, smartness and passion to words… he is the most well behaved, smart, dedicated and well spoken man i have ever read.you know miscommunication? reverse it and make it a character and you have roman fucking kitt.his maturity level is reachless, he apologized to iris the second the understood his words came out offensive (unintentionally), asked her if she wants to talk when she looks bothered, said to her that she’ll never be alone, asked for a final assignment since he believes that he had a unfair advantage; you literally can see he cares, not only hear by his words. he doesn’t just sees her, he seesthroughher.honestly i believe that i can make you love him by listing his actions and not even adding my thoughts about him;he quitted his dream job, broke his engagement, stood against his father’s expectations to travel hundreds of kilometers on a train that broke down and walked his way through the war just to be with the girl he loves.this is not enough? okay,he was the only one to check her when she didn’t show up at work, waited behind her door until he was sure that she locked it, gets so worried about her being wounded that he couldn’t bear to sit and wondered through till 3am, rereads all the letters that iris has sent to him every night before bed, crawled to her while he was bleeding and dying, trying to reach her in his last breath.HE PRACTICALLY DIED FOR HER.“I pray that my days will be long at your side. Let me fill and satisfy every longing in your soul. May your hand be in mine, by sun and by night. Let our breaths twine and our blood become one, until our bones return to dust. Even then, may I find your soul still sworn to mine.”romaniris:they are fated mates. i don’t care if they are not faes or magical creatures,they are destined to be with each other.god, those letters made me cry like twenty times, the pure love among them cannot be reached by any other couple that exists. roman admiring iris’ writing and taking courage from it, his soul getting a peaceful silence while reading her letters, him being proud when iris acts brave and stands up for her words, devotes himself to her; iris not being afraid to be seen by him at her worst, her sensing the second roman arrives in a room, falling for him twice, being ready to die with him.. they both stated that there was no way for them to live if another dies. they showed each other they both deserve to be loved and be happy, and best way for them to have it was.. being by each other’s side.”But I think there is a magical link between you and me. A bond that not even distance can break.”i want to add some thoughts onwomen friendshipstoo, because they were incredibly sincere and beautiful. marisol taking iris and attie under her wings right away, they all helping each other with chores and acting as a whole, preparing garden for arrival of keegan, attie calling iris her favourite flower, they all encouraging each other, iris calling marisol and attie her family that she is bonded by something deeper than blood, this small details got my eyes watery by showing how much of a special thing to have friends that you can call your home.i wrote so much yet so little, because there is no words to describe how beautiful this book was in the history of languages. this is the part where my reviews ends, however, it encouraged me to write a love letter for two precious humans, so here it is;💌dear shei and bru,i have been always a defender of the fact that distance makes everything fade away, but i believe our friendship is the biggest exception of my belief. we have continents between us, however you two become my home in the last few days. the book was indeed most beautiful literature piece i have ever laid my hands on, but the reason i will carry it in my heart is because of you two, thank you for being iris and attie to my marisol. so sheila luminous de guereñu docampo and bruna transcendent silva barbosa, below the sky i’m walking through, and the depth in my heart, you two aremy little constellations.yours,-s.oct 7:i want ‘cause of death: ending of this book’ written in my tombstone. rtc when i can function again.oct 3:br with my precious girlsbrunaandshei💗""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""—— 5 ✰ stars.'As if I am a puzzle, and im now missing pieces and I will never feel that pure sense of completion again'・❥・ Mood of the book: never let me go by Florence + the machine.'And grief is a long, difficult process, especially when it is so racked by guilt'OKAY.Takes deep breath, sits down, crosses leg and clears throat.Welcome to this mess!!!!

(…) You wish that you could take their place, no matter the cost. “Just so you can have the peace of knowing their fate.”“I love the words I write until I soon realize how much I hate them, as if I am destined to always be at war with myself”The pace of the story varies a lot, at first it is a little slow, then it picks up pace, but it is a little irregular. What I do have to say is that it never bored me. Both my book girls and I, whether due to the time difference or our schedules, found it difficult to stop reading so that the missing one could catch up with us, “one more chapter alone…” and it became 5 more chapters.✧˖*°࿐𝒄𝒉𝒂𝒓𝒂𝒄𝒕𝒆𝒓𝒔:➶-͙˚ ༘✶ 𝑹𝒐𝒎𝒂𝒏 𝑪.

How one little thing like typing a letter can open a door you never saw. A transcendent connection. A divine threshold.” ✨This truly was such agemof a book.I can’t get over it.Divine rivals couldn’t be any more true to its name as here you have two journalist rivals — Iris and Roman. Both of them find themselves competing for a coveted spot at the newspaper they work at and of course Iris finds her rival infuriating to be around yet handsome but she fails to realize the connection brewing between them.Two enchanted typewriters that are linked, both characters in the midst of an ever growing mystical war among gods, shared grief in their losses, and a divine unbreakable connection that even Roman believes to be true“I think there is a magical link between you and me.” A bond that not even distance can break.”that is what you can expect from thisNow on to what I loved about the characters:Iris and Romans rivals to lovers build up was done as well as could be even if I wanted more . I was relishing in how annoyed he made her and their banter along with the love and vulnerability each shared with each other esp in those letters — letters that only one of them knew who was on the other end and that made it all the more intriguing to see unravelThe letters held such vulnerability yet strength written in them, it was everythingg to read each. Even more when they started signing off their letters as“—Iris and —CtoLove, Iris and Your Kitt”💌I loved loved loved their admiration for each others work and hyping each other up — more so Roman when it came to Iris herself and her words.“Your letters have been a light for me to follow. Your words? A sublime feast that fed me on days when I was starving.”My Iris,"" he said, ""there is no question that you are the brave one, all on your own.""I absolutely loved and adored Iris’ character sm. One of my favorite fmcs. Rebecca’s way of portraying her was amazing to see unfold and develop. The tone for her dialogue felt so wise, mature and strong willed. I felt the need to protect her and let her know she wasn’t alone even though she felt that way. But she didn’t need that bc she was self sufficient all on her own“But I realize that people are just people, and they carry their own set of fears, dreams, desires, pains, and mistakes. I can’t expect someone else to make me feel complete; I must find it on my own.”She exemplified such strength, bravery, selflessness and determination despite the loneliness and hardships she experienced. I felt like I connected with her and saw her in myself (we love the relatability) and all the way through I was rootingg for her“Get a grip on yourself, she thought, hands on her knees, eyes closed. This is war. This is what you signed up for. Don’t look away from it.”Roman was just so kind, so soft with her, so infuriatingly handsome (in my head), mine and everyone else’s book husband as of now, and so selfless as he dropped everything to follow her! as if I didn’t already love him and he goes and does that while also protecting her with his life. **Roman really made it difficult for me to enjoy a romance when it comes to my expectations in how a man speaks tomethe fmc in a book 😩 I legit melted every time he’d say her name (I imagine it’s soft)“Iris,” he whispered.”soo much whispering but I get why“You and I … we need to stay together. We’re better this way.”“I think you and I are simply better together, Kitt.”I loved the addition of the small found family she found in Marisol and Attie. It warmed my heart to know she had this as she really deserved to have itShe realized this was her family now. That there were bonds that ran deeper than blood.”There were minimal fantasy elements in this but the story on its own was amazing to not to care sm for it. But I have hope the inclusion of the gods is expanded upon further in the next book esp as their characters felt more like an introduction to them in this———————————————Ultimately, this was written so impeccable with such a compelling plot and I was in complete awe because of it. The romance wasexquisite, as was the characterization and the connection between them in their trauma and grief endured. The war aspect was also written in great detail as well with the angst of it depicted for how it truly is and what it’s like.I’m gonna need the next book asap as I have so many questions than answers in what happens next after that cliffhanger??Thank you emara for putting me on to this <33Quotes I loved:“I am coming to love him, in two different ways. Face to face, and word to word.”“The way you show up, day after day, even when you are weary or afraid or simply uncertain. That is strength, and I see it in you.”“Little flower,” I see it now. The name suits you.P.S. Hi, Iris.”“Kissing him in the dark was entirely different from kissing him in the light.”“I can’t risk having people behold me as I truly am. But there\'s also a small voice in the back of my mind, a voice that tell me, You will miss so much by being so guarded”“I rarely share this part of my life with others, but I want to tell it to you now. A piece of armour, because I trust you. A glint of falling steel, because I feel safe with you.”“Roman Cheeky Kitt. Roman Cantankerous Kitt. Roman Conceited Kitt.”“I want to know everything about you, Iris. I want to know your hopes and your dreams. I want to know what irritates you and what makes you smile and what makes you laugh and what you long for most in this world.”“He began to see the invisible threads that drew him to Iris. It didn\'t feel like fate; Roman didn\'t quite believe in such fancies. But it certainly felt like something. Something that was now stealing his sleep and making his chest ache with each breath”“Your grief will never fully fade; it will always be with you — a shadow you carry in your soul — but it will become fainter as your life becomes brighter. You will learn to live outside of it again, as impossible as that may sound”'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '""What the hell are you doing here, Kitt?""she demanded, shoving his chest.""Have you lost your mind?""She felt his hands slide down her back, resting on the curve of her hips.

The sweet romance? The story? Was it the fact that, despite not being part of the age group this was targeted at, I saw myself in both the main characters and could relate to their personal arc, both individually and as a couple?I have no idea, but if I had to try a guess, I\'d say it\'s simply a combination of all these things, plus the fact that Rebecca Ross is a crazy talented author.I\'ve had the chance to discover her just recently, after reading a book that\'d been on my tbr since 2017, and I\'m glad to conclude she\'s gotten even better with time and experience.Divine Rivals is abook I recommend going into blindly and one I definitely can\'t see anyone savoring slowly. Once you get into it, stopping is as hard as breathing under water.Rooting for the main characters to find themselves will become a new hobby, but rooting for them to find happiness by finding each other, will become an obsession.The progression from rivals to lovers is so smooth, almost soothing in its naturality.The setting is atmospheric, described so perfectly you can almost smell the stinging scent of gunpowder, hear the crinkle of the paper and the click of Iris and Roman\'s writing machine\'s keys.I don\'t know why, but while reading it, I couldn\'t stop thinking of one of my favorite movies,Un long dimanche de fiançailles. They have really similar vibes and not because they both take place during a war and tell the story of two very unfortunate lovers, but also because of the gray-ish undertones, the raw portrayal of reality, and the bittersweet romance.I like to consider myself pretty experienced when it comes to the reading scene, but those last pages made me feel like I was on a literal rollercoaster, even though I kind of saw it all coming.I didn\'t expect the pain to be so powerful, probably. It wasn\'t until the end that I realized just how invested I am in the magical realism of this story and the delicious pain that comes with this romance.Speaking of romance. I\'m at a loss of words for how perfect it plainly was.These two simply can\'t not be together. THEY CAN\'T.Roman is adorable, a real gentleman and the most cinnamon roll to ever roll, but for me, Iris stole the show. I admire her so much and my heart cried for how strong and brave she always was, despite everything she had to endure.I can\'t wait for the sequel to come out, even tho, I\'ll admit, I am also a little scared of what will and could happen in it.I hope that, if Rebecca Ross eventually decides to break my heart with Ruthless Vows, she wrecks it neatly so that it\'ll have the strenght to heal properly.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'world building ? don’t know her'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'alexa, play the great war by taylor swift.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""”their names would be entwined—roman and iris or winnow and kitt because could you truly have one without the other?”i fell in love with this book the moment i saw it and reading it made me fall even harder. the beauty of this book is unreal.”a piece of armor, because i trust you. a glint of falling steel, because i feel safe with you.”this book had such beautiful writing. the descriptive imagery had me so easily immersed in the story. it felt like i was a part of the book. the magic fascinated me. and most importantly: i adored roman and iris. they are one of my most special couples.one thing i did not expect going into this experience was for it to make me as emotional as it did. i had tears in my eyes during many chapters. the words on the pages spoke to me. i connected with these characters so much more than i thought i would.“i think about how effortless it is to lose oneself in words, and yet also find who you are.”my favourite part has to be the letters between roman and iris. anyone that knows me knows that letters make me go weak in the knees. reading their exchanges really touched and warmed my heart. there’s something about writing your deepest thoughts and feelings without any eyes on you, and knowing the person on the other side isn’t judging you, that you are not alone. the letters gave us so much insight into roman & iris. we really get to feel their emotions with them, and a lot of it is so relatable.iris winnow-”i’m not afraid to be alone, but i’m tired of being the one left behind. i’m tired of having to rearrange my life after the people within it depart, as if i’m a puzzle and i’m now missing pieces and i will never feel that pure sense of completion again.”she is honestly such a lovely character. i think anyone can see themselves in iris. her emotions and life experiences are very relatable. one of the things i love so much about her is that she’s not afraid to take risks. with her life or her heart. she puts herself out there and she’s ready to accept whatever the consequences are. she doesn’t shy away from anything. and roman is right, she is brave and strong. she went through so much in this book and she is still fighting. she is still surviving. she’s very inspiring.roman kitt-”i don't think you realize how strong you are, because sometimes strength isn't swords and steel and fire, as we are so often made to believe. sometimes it's found in quiet, gentle places.”now where do i find me one? im being so deadass. anyways i need him. he’s a little more apprehensive to open up, but when he does you really see he’s the biggest softie on the inside. the way he would drop anything for her, he would die for her, he lives and breathes iris winnow. he rereads her letters every night. he constantly uplifts her. he knows exactly what she needs at any given moment and its so sweet. iris says jump he asks how high?! he would actually do anything for her and i love that for my best girl.”i think there is a magical link between you and me. a bond that not even distance can break.”i love how when we get each of their povs, they always mention how much they love the others’ laugh and how much joy it brings them. its so small but its always the little things that stick with me and win my heart.“you will miss so much by being so guarded.”i loved this book but i do have to say the world building and the description of the gods was definitely lacking. but the characters themselves don’t even seem to understand their world or why they’re at war so i guess i shouldn’t really expect too much from that. maybe in book 2?also, i felt a disconnect between iris / attie / marisol. i was not picking up what they were putting down. i see that they formed some sort of bond during such a stressful time, but when iris was calling them “home” and her “found family” i was like what? is the found family in the room with us? did i miss a couple chapters because yall were giving roomates at best. there was more telling than showing in that aspect if im being honest.anyways i just know when i think back on this book its always gonna be beautiful memories because what will stick with me is how much i adored the writing and irisroman together. ♡”you are worthy of love. you are worthy to feel joy right now, even in the darkness.”""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '♾/5 ☆“you are worthy of love. You are worthy to feel joy right now, even in the darkness. And just in case you’re wondering… I’m not going anywhere, unless you tell me to leave, and even then, we might need to negotiate.”I honestly didn\'t know what to expect going into this book. I went into it knowing that it is listed as a YA fantasy but didn\'t expect to fall in love with it this much! I had seen so many good things about this, but the reviews just don\'t do it justice. This has become one of my favorite reads for this year!Divine Rivals is the first book in the Letters of Enchantment duet. This is my first book by Rebecca Ross, and I fell in love with it from the very first word, which surprised me since I usually don\'t enjoy third person. Her writing is so beautiful and poetic that it just captured me. Though this is a fantasy, there are some missing pieces to the world building, but as I was reading, I completely overlooked it due to the romance that was present. It\'s a slow burn, work place academic rivals to lovers, where he falls first and harder this always makes me swoon so hard, romantacy that is emotional with angst, tension, grief, death and so much pain that I hadn\'t been expecting.Iris Winnow and Roman Kitt are two young rival journalists. They work at the same newspaper the Oath Gazette and find themselves competing for the same columnist position. While the rivalry between them grows, so does a war that is between the two gods, Dacre and Enva. The two find solace within each other through two magical typewrites that are linked through their letters. Iris begins sharing her daily thoughts and her deepest griefs, and he does in return.""Sometimes I’m afraid to love other people. Everyone I care about eventually leaves me, whether it’s death or war or simply because they don’t want me.""""I realize that people are just people, and they carry their own set of fears, dreams, desires, pains, and mistakes. I can’t expect someone else to make me feel complete; I must find it on my own.""Iris Winnowis so strong, brave, and just precious and needs to be protected at all costs. I absolutely adore this woman. She\'s so mature for her young age and has so much to deal with in her everyday struggles, but she doesn\'t let it affect the way she carries herself and cares for others. I was so happy that she found her own family since all the people she\'s loved have left her in one way or another.\xa0 I just want to wrap my arms around her and give her the biggest hug.""But just in case you were wondering… I’ll gladly read whatever you write.""“You mentioned the other day that you think I’m only here to ‘outshine’ you. But that’s the furthest thing from the truth. I broke my engagement, quit my job, and traveled six hundred kilometers into war- torn land to be with you, Iris.”Roman C. Kittis grumpy and stubborn in the beginning, but when the layers start to peel back and we are left with the sweetest, kindest, gentleman that I swear you will ever meet. He had me absolutely swooning. His life seems so perfect from the outside, but he has so many struggles that make me love him even more. I won\'t go into detail as I want you to fall in love with him as I did. He goes through great lengths for Iris to show how much she means to him and cares for her. I mean, he stands outside her door and waits for her to lock it before he leaves. He raises the bar for real men, and I\'ve just added a new book boyfriend to the long list.""He didn’t want to live in a world without her and her words.""""She couldn’t bear to live in a world without him.""""“I think you and I are simply better together, Kitt,”""Their names would be entwined—Roman and Iris or Winnow and Kitt because could you truly have one without the other?""RomanIrisare the definition of soulmates. Their chemistry is so palpable from the very beginning, even as they were still rivals. Iris gave Roman the following nicknames Roman Cheeky Kitt. Roman Cantankerous Kitt. Roman Conceited Kitt and I loved them all. They had me giggling and kicking my feet. The way that he would do anything for her and the love he has for her words had me on my knees swooning. Their love for each other was felt through every moment on the pages. And the letters they wrote to each other are everything and so much more! They were making up some of my favorite parts. I need someone to write me love letters NOW!Side charactersI absolutely adored the love and found family that Marisol, Attie, and Keegan shared with Iris. They are the family that Iris never knew she would need. The way that they became close knit so quickly and will always look out for and do anything for one another is so precious. Now Iris\' mother Aster and her brother Forest I\'m not sure how I feel about them. They both did things that I couldn\'t fully agree with. I\'m hoping for some redemption from Forest for what he did in the next book.""It’s odd, how quickly life can change, isn’t it? How one little thing like typing a letter can open a door you never saw. A transcendent connection. A divine threshold.""That cliffhanger has me feeling so much. I was not expecting that ending at all. I will bepatiently ummmimpatiently waiting for the release of the next book because I have so many questions that I need answers for.Favorite moments/quotes""Perhaps it begins with one person. Someone you trust. You remove a piece of armor for them; you let the light stream in, even if it makes you wince. Perhaps that is how you learn to be soft yet strong, even in fear and uncertainty. One person, one piece of steel.""“I don’t want to wake up when I’m seventy- four only to realize I haven’t lived.”""I don’t think you realize how strong you are, because sometimes strength isn’t swords and steel and fire, as we are so often made to believe. Sometimes it’s found in quiet, gentle places. The way you hold someone’s hand as they grieve. The way you listen to others. The way you show up, day after day, even when you are weary or afraid or simply uncertain.""She unfortunately had to sit on Roman Kitt’s lap, nearly all the way to the front lines.~~Oh, how I would gladly take her place...“I prefer salty over sweet. I prefer sunsets over sunrises, but only because I love to watch the constellations begin to burn. My favorite season is autumn, because my mum and I both believed that’s the only time when magic can be tasted in the air. I am a devout tea lover and can drink my weight in it.”“I have the worst sweet tooth imaginable,” Roman began. “I prefer sunrises, but only because I like the possibilities a new dawn brings. My favorite season is spring, because baseball returns. I prefer coffee, although I’ll drink whatever is placed in front of me.”""It’s not a crime to feel joy, even when things seem hopeless. Iris, look at me. You deserve all the happiness in the world. And I intend to see that you have it.”“I think we all wear armor. I think those who don’t are fools, risking the pain of being wounded by the sharp edges of the world, over and over again.""“I pray that my days will be long at your side. Let me fill and satisfy every longing in your soul. May your hand be in mine, by sun and by night. Let our breaths twine and our blood become one, until our bones return to dust. Even then, may I find your soul still sworn to mine.”~~ This right here got me all on my feels because it\'s the absolute sweetest.~~~~~~~RomanIris are everything 🥹rtcwhen I can form thoughts...~~~~~~~In my fantasy era.

I wholly, truly and irrevocably fell in love with these two andtheir love.They areso so so preciousand I love them with my whole heart.“He didn’t answer, but his gaze held hers, and she thought she saw something flicker through him, like a star falling from the cosmos, or a coin underwater, reflecting the sun.

One person, one piece of steel.”I wasfascinated by the storyand the characters from the very first chapter. I mean how could I not whenRebecca\'s writing is this beautiful and exquisitethat I have no words to describe it. She just became one of my favourite authors with this book only. I loved the wayRebecca dealt with heavy topics like grief, loss of loved ones to war, healing and everything.The characters were well written that I could feel every emotion they felt.The connection between the main characters and side characterswas amazing. I liked Attie and Marisol and they both were amazing side characters.“I realize that people are just people, and they carry their own set of fears, dreams, desires, pains, and mistakes. I can’t expect someone else to make me feel complete; I must find it on my own.”It hasRivals to Loverswith""She is glaring at him but he is grinning at her.""trope. I mean its essential if its a rivals to lovers book.You know whats better than a book written in third pov?A well-written book in third pov and Rebecca just proved it.And I need more of Roman\'s povs but mostly I need the scene in his pov where Iris had to sit in his lap for 3 hours while they were travelling 🤭“She was glaring at him now. That fire in her eyes could have brought him to his knees.”The fantasy and the world building about the gods in their world was a bit underdeveloped.It was more about people and their fears related to war and how they fought and survived. Their world divided in two parts- Dacre\' s followers and those who were called upon by the goddess Enva to fight her wars. There was a little story mentioned about Dacre and Enva\'s feud and also the other gods but I wanted to know more about Dacre and Enva\'s story and exactly what happened between them that led to this war. And I still don\'t understand that why Enva was not their fighting in the war like Dacre was doing that. But I\'m also hoping we get all the answers in the sequel.➸ Iris WinnowI love this girl.She is so archer coded 🏹I loved reading her povs the most and as much as her inner monologues were painful they were also so damn relatable. She\'s been through the worst but I admire her for her strength, her kindness and resilience. She\'s just 18 but she\'s so mature and brave and I liked we saw her growth throughout the book. I saw her struggles and how she grew out of them and always found a way to be there for others and her family. I was also happy that she now has her own found family. Even if she lost everything she got a job as a war correspondent because she wanted to see her brother. She isone of the best FMCs\'I\'ve had a chance to read about this year.“I rarely share this part of my life with others, but I want to tell it to you now. A piece of armor, because I trust you. A glint of falling steel, because I feel safe with you.”➸ Roman Carver KittYes I\'m obsessed withRoman Cheeky Kittor was itRoman Cantankerous KittorRoman Conceited Kitt?!Whatever it was I just love this man so much. He is such a sweetheart and perfect in every way. He was a bit grumpy in the start but that was also hot.He\'s just 19 and well mannered and he waited for Iris to lock her door.I mean no real man would ever do this and its the basic thing everyone should know about. He is intelligent, charming and also witty. Where do I find him because I wanna marry him!! The way he fell for Iris and then took care for her whenever he could and the way he shared his story and his secrets with her even though he was a bit reticent to share them at first. I loved it.“Your letters have been a light for me to follow. Your words? A sublime feast that fed me on days when I was starving. I love you, Iris.”╰┈➤ Their relationshipThey had been working and competing against each other for the same position but they always had this spark between them and this undeniable chemistry.The rivals to lovers wasn\'t there muchbecause they were already attracted towards each other but I loved that they still bickered and bantered even after felling in love with each other. Roman brings out the fire in Iris and he protected her with his life everytime.“Going easy on me, then?” He arched a brow. “That’s surprising. We’re supposed to duel to the death.”“Has anyone ever told you that you squint when you lie?” His scowl only deepened.“No, but only because no one has spent as much time looking at me as you do, Winnow.”The letters they shared, the secrets and pain they wrote about in those letters, the way they let their armor fall one by one to be vulnerable with each other, the way they earned each others\' trust, the way Roman followed her to the war sight to be with her, their morning runs, the way they fell in love with each other, the way their loved grew stronger and stronger everyday. It was just mesmerisingly beautiful.They truly are ✨️SOULMATES✨️“I broke my engagement, quit my job, and traveled six hundred kilometers into war-torn land to be with you, Iris.”Their love was just so sweet and wholesome and aching and even the war couldn\'t taint it.Did everything between them was rushed after they fell in love?Yes.Did I mind it?Absolutely Not.Because it was war time and they didn\'t even knew if they had a chance to see each other next morning, so they did what they could do and it was perfect and reasonable. They can\'t just wait for the war to be over or be adults in their early 20s to get married when they already saw the brutal reality of war and what it could do to people.“You and I … we need to stay together. We’re better this way.”“I am coming to love him, in two different ways. Face to face, and word to word.”The ending completely shattered my heart in pieces.Why would Rebecca did this to me. They just found their happiness after so much pain and trauma and Rebecca just ripped it away from them and left them with so many regrets and pain. Iris couldn\'t even tell him how much she loved him and that asshole brother of her didn\'t even tried to save Roman?? I hate Forest and I don\'t believe a word he said and Rebecca better give us a happy ending for them in book 2 or I\'ll riot 🤺— Some other beautiful quotes —➸ “It takes courage to let down your armor, to welcome people to see you as you are. Sometimes I feel the same as you: I can’t risk having people behold me as I truly am. But there’s also a small voice in the back of my mind, a voice that tells me, “You will miss so much by being so guarded.”➸ “I am so afraid. And yet how I long to be vulnerable and brave when it comes to my own heart.”➸ “There are good days and there are difficult days. Your grief will never fully fade; it will always be with you— a shadow you carry in your soul— but it will become fainter as your life becomes brighter. You will learn to live outside of it again , as impossible as that may sound.”➸ “I don’t want to wake up when I’m seventy-four only to realize I haven’t lived.”➸ “Kissing him in the dark was entirely different from kissing him in the light. When the sun had gilded them hours ago, they had been eager and clumsy and hungry. But now, in the shadows of night, they were languid and thorough and curious.”➸ “I think about how effortless it is to lose oneself in words, and yet also find who you are.”To my emotional buddy read partner Rae 🫂 thankyou for hearing all my ramblings and screaming in our dm. You are the best and I can\'t wait to read another heartbreaking book with you.———————————————————————————Rae and I are definitely alergic to books with happy endings 😃 so here we are again to fall in love with this book just to let it break our hearts in the end.Br with my most beautiful girl Raerae 💗'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'DNF at 57%. I feel like I’ve read a completely different book to everyone else?I went in with high expectations due to the hype but ended up being disappointed. A great concept but it was poorly done.The lack of world building made me feel disconnected from the entire story.The characters lacked depth and the dialogue was cringy, especially the letters 😖The plot stumbled along, and the central war element was majorly underdeveloped. There was no suspense whatsoever from what you’d expect whilst living through a war.I just don’t get it 😞'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""This book had such a strong start. I was so intrigued by the mythology that for the first time maybe ever I really didn't care much about the romance. The middle of the book took me quite a bit of time to get through, but the end picked back up in a way that has me excited to read the sequel. I hope that the next book deals more with the myths and gods etc. Overall I'd say the plot was much stronger than the romance, which I didn't find myself particularly invested in.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Reread 25/12/2023:I stand by everything I said last time and more.

I\'m going to savour it as much as I can because I don\'t want their story to end...⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆First read review 22/11/2023:★5 stars""He didn\'t want to live in a world without her and her words"";“She couldn\'t bear to live in a world without him""Probably the most surprised I\'ve been with how I felt about a book after reading it. I went into this book without really knowing what it was about, other than that it\'s a YA fantasy and super popular. What I wasn\'t expecting was howbeautifullywell written this book is. This book made me feel like I was wrapped in a warm blanket and Rebecca Ross\'s words gave me a big hug the whole time.To me, the concept of this book felt like it was a mix ofThe Hating Game, Beach Read and the Book Thiefwith elements of a dystopian fantasy.★The plot★This book follows Iris and Kitt who are both reporters working together and competing for the position of columnist at a newspaper called the Oath Gazette. This book is set in a historical period and a war between the gods Dacre and Enva is escalating and getting close to their homes in Oath. Iris is less fortunate and is experiencing hardship while Kitt initially appears to be a well educated, high society pretty boy with a sense of entitlement. The twist? Both Iris and Kitt have magical typewriters that send letters to each other and Iris doesn\'t know who the recipient is.╰⪼ThoughtsI was tossing up giving this book between 4 and 5 stars. Overall, I think the plot was probably 4 stars. I found it incredibly interesting and a unique take on a fantasy book intertwined with a historical fiction/romance. For a fantasy book, some people might find the world building wasn\'t massively present but I personally didn’t think it needed to be as it wasn\'t the main focus of this book. This book was received exactly the way it was intended to and was so much more than just another fantasy or romance book. The writing was a masterpiece and pushed this book to 5 stars for me.I loved that Rebecca didn\'t try to overwhelm the characters with a heroism or saviour complex concerning the war like most fantasy books would have done. By making Iris and Kitt correspondents you experienced the war and its effects through a raw lens. This book speaks to larger social issues, the importance of appreciating what you have, processing grief and shows the characters strength and resilience. Most importantly, this book showcasesthe power of words.The letterswere my favourite part about this entire book, you just have to read them for yourself to appreciate this.★Iris Winnow★Iris Enchanting Winnow, Iris Ethereal Winnow, Iris Exquisite Winnow, Iris Elizabeth Winnow.Ohh Iris I just wanted to give her a big hug the whole time. This poor girl went through so much at just 18 years old and was so emotionally mature. She had a lot of insecurity and had a hard time believing anyone could love her or do something kind for her without thinking they were making fun of her. She was so strong and compartmentalised her feelings to help others and do what needed to be done without question but she also had the ability to be so open to Kitt about her struggles and feelings. Her vulnerability when she had every reason not to be was so refreshing.""I am so afraid. And yet I long to be vulnerable and brave when it comes to my own heart.""★Roman Kitt★Roman Condescending Kit, Roman Upperclass Kit, Roman Confounded Kit, Roman Competitive Kit, Roman Chaffing Kit, Roman Cheeky Kit, Roman Cantankerous Kit, Roman Conceited Kitt and Roman Carver Kit 😭💗Again, Kitt was so emotionally mature for a 19 year old. His upbringing might have looked better than Iris\'s on the outside but he was battling an internal war with himself over the grief of his sister\'s death and his father\'s suffocating expectations of him. I loved that he fell first and his initial actions just reiterated how much she meant to him - that her words were hisinvisible stringholding him together. I loved watching his facade slowly crumble around him throughout this book, it was written so well.He followed her to war 😭 and the best part? He didn\'t go to convince her to go home or to sideline her. He just went to be with her because he couldn\'t stand to be away from her. He understood the importance of what they were doing and despite the risks, he didn\'t want to take anything away from her, just support her.""Iris! Iris, it\'s me, Kitt.""(sobbing) 🥹🎶I kept listing tothis is me trying, invisible string and tis the damn seasonby Taylor Swift while reading this and they just fit so well for Kitt and Iris🎶QuotesI honestly could keep rambling on about this and it\'s starting to feel like an open love letter but I\'ll leave you some of my favourite quotes:➸ “I’m tired of having to rearrange my life after the people within it depart, as if I’m a puzzle and I’m now missing pieces and I will never feel that pure sense of completion again.”➸ ""An then when you nabbed the first assignment and I read your article...

They made him ache.""➸""He began to see the invisible threads that drew him to Iris. It didn\'t feel like fate; Roman didn\'t quite believe in such fantasies. But it certainly felt like something. Something that was now stealing his sleep and making his chest ache with each breath.""➸ “I don’t think you realise how strong you are, because sometimes strength isn’t swords and steel and fire, as we are so often made to believe. Sometimes it’s found in quiet, gentle places.”➸ “The way you show up, day after day, even when you are weary or afraid or simply uncertain. That is strength, and I see it in you.”➸ “I rarely share this part of my life with others, but I want to tell it to you now. A piece of armour, because I trust you. A glint of falling steel, because I feel safe with you.”➸ ""If she wasn\'t so exhausted and stiff from the harrowing encounter they had miraculously survived, she would have knocked away his touch. She would have slapped him. She might have kissed him.""➸ ""What is a synonym for sublime? Transcendent. Divine."" 😫➸ “I want to know everything about you, Iris.

And intelligent...and infuriating...)","[{'rating': 1, 'content': ""I have a love-hate relationship with Ali Hazelwood's writing and please excuse me if this review gets a tad too expressive 😊 I was really excited to read this but the whole experience was a massively disappointing one.It started off decent and interesting.I liked Mallory,her looking out for her family and siblings was something that resonated with me on some level. I liked her relationship with her sisters and how selflessly she gave for years and years. Sabrina and Darcy were okayish. I liked Sabrina better, as Darcy was all over the place. Look, I know it's not a fair comment given she's just 12 but am gonna tell you why she pissed me off, or rather Ali's writing pissed me off.I found the book after a 100 page mark to be boring and getting worse.Although I liked the chess elements and it was interesting enough to keep me reading, but I didn't sign up for chess alone. I thought I was promised romance too, on which I'll elaborate further.First, I'll come toNolan.Was he there in the book? Oh, he was? Where? Oh, he was the love interest. Was there a blossoming love? Oh, there was... Where? Basically, he was so basic, he is forgettable. He has the personality of a rock. The man has no expression. I couldn't care less if he had something to say or not, which mostly he does not. He just pouts, glances, glares and that's his day.The romance did not come across as romance,or even a budding one at that. Mallory and Nolan had minimal chemistry. They came across as colleagues throughout the book and nothing more. Their interactions were made to appear as something deep but it really wasn't.Coming to my not so favorite topic- Ali's writing.I know it's her first YA book but it came across as trying TOO hard. The overloading of unfunny jokes was just cringe worthy. The gen Z references were never ending. But the worst of all was how she wrote about sex.Now, I know this might be perceived as unpopular in today's world but YA does not need to have a lot of sex talk in it.Few sentences, one or two paragraphs talking about it in a mature and tasteful and educational manner is fine. But when the 12 year old character starts pestering the adults to talk about their sex life while talking about her adult sister's sex life to a man she just met, is just creepy, and sends a wrong message. Sure, teens talk about sex and make sex jokes- but amongst themselves. Not to some random guy they have just met!! Also, why is there so much sex talk in this book when the targeted audience is not NA.I might be a bit old school here but I stay firm in my position- LET YA BOOKS BE YA!!Authors must be cautious in how they deal with sex in this genre.

It’ll come up a lot. Like massive arms and massive hands, which is how you know he is packing a massive…rook to knight combo. That’s how chess works, right? I’m not really sure but that is what is so great aboutCheck & Matebecause even if you previously had no interest in chess this book is so charming and energetic about the game that you’ll have a great time no matter what. I am absolute dog shit at chess—my phone app has beaten me enough to accept this—but I am delighted that Hazelwood said “you know what should be sexy?CHESS!” Hazelwood has made a name for herself with a wildly successful series of spicy adult novels featuring young women navigating fields typically gatekept by men and finding romance and here she enters the realm of YA where 18 year old Mallory returns to the world of chess, rusty from a long hiatus inflicted by shame and keeping her family afloat. Now she must face-off against misogynistic expectations and chess world champion slash thirst trap icon Nolan “I swear I’m not an Adam Driver Insert” Sawyer. The “Kingkiller”. The man with the big, meaty, sexy hands (remember this). But also the man she embarrassed by defeating in her first match, making her the new, hot topic about Chess World. Hazelwood writes with bubbly wit and while the constant corporate branding name drops might make one wonder if this book is collecting ad revenue, it's a fresh and fun rom-com that deals with themes of teen parentification, friendship anxieties and being thrust into a judgemental spotlight where the personal life you can barely keep from falling apart is suddenly the topic of social media speculation.Check & Mateis as corny as it is horny but, honestly, it's also just a good time that knows its audience well.‘His movements, when he touches the pieces, are precise, economical, strong. I hate myself for noticing that.’Girl, trust me, we all noticed that. Anyways, I found the premise of this to be quite promising and it lives up to it. It’s almost interesting enough to uphold the reluctant rivals to lovers engine that drives the story. While most realistic-fiction YA tends towards a high school setting, it was refreshing to see this being set in chess tournaments and libraries (‘God bless libraries.’ Agreed). Part of the premise is that chess is now the Big Thing thanks to Tiktok and Sawyer, the bad boy of chess, for inspiring a lot of content around his looks and temper tantrums (Kylo Ren behavior…), which, sure, I could believe that happening in this post-The Queen’s Gambit-fame, social media influenced world. And the youth getting really into chess is a super cool idea, I’d love that to happen. It also helps raise the stakes in this book because chess matches are covered like they are the Super Bowl and the cash prize is enormous. And so are Sawyer’s arms.The financial opportunities are key to our gal Mal’s motivations, and shd has more or less vanished from her own life in order to raise her aggressively-tween sisters and care for her sick mother. Hazelwood presents the hardships of a parentified teen who feels cornered by her own life that has been bent towards constant service of others to the point that taking time for herself is guilt-inducing. But all of chess is cloaked in a sense of shame for her and she hadn’t played in years, though the reason behind this is something Hazelwood only teases until the big reveal late in the novel (though its so hinted at I doubt the reason will come as a surprise to anyone after the first 20 pages). Hazelwood captures being burnt out and frustrated well while also making detangling all her insecurities a coming-of-age narrative nestled into the overall plot.‘There’s lots to consider. My feelings about chess, for one, which I cannot disentangle from my feelings for Dad. They are twisted, knotted together. There’s pain. Regret. Nostalgia. Guilt. Hate. Above all, there’s anger. So much anger inside me. Mountains of it, entire blasing landscapes without a single furyless corner in them.’The YA genre suits Hazelwood well, being able to turn on the firehose of emotions and make the more immature or quippy moments read as more age appropriate as it does in some of the adult novels Hazelwood often gets compared with. I enjoyed that the characters are older than most YA, being in that sort of anxiety-ridden purgatory between high school and “being an adult”. A great example of this is Mallory’s friendship with Easton and the interplay of Mallory feeling FOMO as Easton goes off to college while Easton worries she is being similarly phased out due to Mallory’s rising-star adventures. While Hazelwood is known for being pretty spicy she tones it back a lot here to suit a YA audience in ways that never feel like self-censorship. There’s still a lot of waistband grabbing (those big, manly hands…) and brief steamy moments though its mostly fade-to-black. Perhaps the lack of sex in the book also helped focus on ensuring the plot held up and was engaging. Truthfully, I couldn’t put this down.Still, I liked these characters—the dialog is fun and snarky without feeling like it needs toonlybe one-liners to the point of absurdity—and while Mal and Sawyer’s relationship sometimes seems to conveniently progress despite them really only talking about chess its all pretty cute. Sawyer’s character works well as an example of misconstrued perceptions on a person and behind the mystique he is actually quite a lovable person who treats Mallory well. He’s also possibly an Adam Driver-cast insert as both Driver and Star Wars get a call-out in text. This seems to be Hazelwood’s thing andThe Love Hypothesisbegan as Star Wars Reylo fanfiction in a STEM field and minus Kylo Ren’s penchant for war crimes. Plus we have the whole Mallory as a sort of “chosen one” who defeats temper tantrum boy who has trained for years which isn’t NOT the plot ofForce Awakensif you squint at it. Though Sawyer’s grandfather and his mental health issues come up, thankfully he wasn’t notable for having committed a genocide. Have I mentioned that this guy is hulking?‘Most women in chess decide to skip these events and complete in women-only tournaments. I bet you’re wondering why.’While Sawyer is supportive and sweet, the rest of the chess world is a minefield of misogyny for Mallory to navigate. Journalists love to ask her ‘how does it feel to be a women in chess?’ and her first experience with Koch—essentially the villain of the book—is him asking if she beat Sawyer by dressing evocatively. Good on Hazelwood for addressing the extra pressures and judgment on a woman in male-coded fields while inspiring young women to embrace their hobbies and strengths and achieve in whatever they want to do. But also good on her for making Koch so fun to hate. I mean, this guy is basically some teenage Ben Shapiro character twiddling his evil mustache (okay Koch doesn’t have a mustache but you get the idea) and being insufferable to everyone. You’ll want to punch him. A few times.There are a lot of complaints online about the use of slang and pop culture references here, which is whatever. Does it seem like a sort of eye rolling technique to be “this is how teens talk right?”, sure. But I do want to start a conspiracy theory that books will have product inserts as the new form of tv commercials because Hazelwood name-checks so many corporate brands and highly-specific product names that it feels weird. It’s like when the kid is sleep-talking brands inWhite Noiseand I kept joking that this book is generating ad revenue to keep the publishing industry rolling.After having read Colleen Hoover and Emily Henry this year, I figured I should complete the trifecta and read an Ali Hazelwood and I’m pretty glad I did. Overall, this was pretty fun. It moves at a quick pace (shocking for a story about chess games, I know) and has some pretty fun ups-and-downs while following a fairly formulaic romance plotline. Sure I could probably nitpick stuff about plot holes or whatever, but at the end of the day that seems beside the point to me. I’m judging this based on my rule I’ve just now invented called theA Knights TaleRule: believability is beside the point when you came to laugh along to a story about Heath Ledger looking great on a horse. This is fun and cute and I had a pleasant time reading it. It also achieves its main goal: making chess seem sexy. So excuse me, I’m going to go get my ass kicked by my chess app again and pretend I’m Gary Kasparov playing against Deep Blue.3.5/5“Chess is a bad idea.”“Why?”“Look where it got me.”“It got you here.

Though, if you are familiar with the pattern followed in Ali Hazelwood’s other books, you can probably guess the “twist” that comes towards the end.The character dynamics among the MC’s family felt really interesting and made Mallory feel much more like a real person. It made me wish we had gotten more of the same with Sawyer’s found family outside of the interactions with Mallory so I could see him as more than an obscenely tall, love interest and chess machine.In case you are wondering if there is any variety in the character descriptions from her other books, I feel I should point out that Ms. Hazelwood remains consistent in her writing. Paraphrased examples: “His hands are massive” and “I couldn’t miss him because he stands a head everyone else in the room”I will likely continue to read her books because they’re fun, typically light reads, but I wish she would give us some diversity in her characters.

I\'ve heard from many people that Ali Hazelwood writes very cringe smutty scenes, but I had never read her books before this one, but let me tell you, this book had no smut. If i\'m going to be honest, I went into this book completely blind, which I think made me love it even more. I couldn\'t stop laughing the entire time, the characters had the best banter, the Gen-Z references had me cackling so much. The gorgeous pink cover is so gorgeous and I just fell in love. For my first time reading a book written by Ali Hazelwood, I can finally say I had the best experience. I laughed so much my stomach hurt, I had tears streaming down my face from all the laughing. I truly loved this book so much, it was cute, fluffy, fun, hilarious, and just so good. For those of you that haven\'t read this book yet, do yourself a huge favor and pick it up immediately, I can\'t recommend it enough.GEN-Z REFERENCES*Snapchat*BTS*OnlyFans*Twitter*Tiktok*Taylor Swift*Billie Eilish*Ed Sheeran body pillow (WHAT?)*Candy Crush*This is just the basic list, but there\'s plenty more.Mallory Greenleaf is done with chess. The destruction of chess destroyed her family for the worst. During a tournament, Mallory caught her father kissing another woman, meanwhile he had a family of his own. Since then, Mallory\'s father has unexpectedly passed away. After the sport of chess led to the destruction of her family four year earlier, Mallory\'s focus is now on her mom, her sisters, paying the bills, and her dead end job as a car mechanic to keep the lights on. Mallory is the oldest of three daughters, she plays surrogate mother as her mother is sick and can\'t really move, let alone take care of her other two daughters. Mallory\'s sister, Sabrina, drove me insane. Sabrina was totally ungrateful and only cared about herself. As Mallory was working her butt of trying to make ends meet, all Sabrina cared about was getting her derby bills paid. I couldn\'t help but cheer and love Mallory, I just wanted to reach into my kindle and give her the biggest hug ever, with no words. Mallory\'s main focus is on her mom and sisters, but that is until she begrudgingly agrees to play in one last charity tournament and wipes the board clean against Nolan Sawyer. Nolan is completely shocked that Mallory beat him, but he wants to keep playing her over and over again.Okay, how did Mallory and Nolan play a game for seven hours straight? The only thing I can do for seven hours is read and sleep. Nolan Sawyer is known as the ""Kingkiller"" of chess, currently the world champion and reigning bad boy of chess. Nolan is a tall, grumpy, and temperamental chess player on the outside, but on the inside he is a soft, sugary cinnamon roll. The only thing I had a issue with is that Ali Hazelwood would always talk about how tall Nolan was, like okay, I get it, Nolan is tall as fuck. Nolan was a sweetheart, he might be the bad boy of chess and the world champion, but he wanted to keep playing Mallory over and over to secretly help her become the best female chess player in the world. The things Nolan did for Mallory just warmed my heart so much.Cinnamon roll sweetheart, Nolan Sawyer, had my heart in a choke hold.I couldn\'t help but love Mallory and Nolan , they were just two precious souls. Nolan was very sarcastic and very blunt during press interviews, he was never afraid to speak what was on his mind. Despite Mallory being back in her chess world, she wants to keep her family out of it, but that\'s kind of hard when there\'s tabloids of Mallory and Nolan going around. Mallory and Nolan were just have a conversation, but people made the picture of them together go viral like Mallory and Nolan were dating.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '“When I’m with you, Mallory, everything is different. When I’m with you, I want to play more than I want to win.”It feels like I\'ve been deceived by Ali and this book. My first anticipated read of this month and this book definitely wasn\'t what I expected. I was so excited to read it because it is written by Ali and she said it\'s anangsty rivals to lovers story in chess worldbut it was more about chess tournaments and chess championships than Mallory and Nolan and their rivals to lovers romance. The plot had so much potential but the execution of it was a bit off and unsatisfactory. How can you expect me to read 350 pages about the never ending chess tournaments and how FIDE and all the things worked in chess world. There was just too much info dumping about it. I wantedmore focus on character\'s development and romantic partof the story.“He leans toward me over the table, dark eyes earnest, stars traveling on his skin. “Do you know how incredible you are?”Ali seriously need to stop using Gen Z referenceslike TikTok, OnlyFans, Riverdale, AO3, Discord, Jeff Bezos, Timothée Chalamet and Cole Sprouse in her books. I was so close to dnf this book because of these refrences. Honestly I never had any problem with Gen Z refrences in books but the way Ali tried to put these in almot every sentence and conversation between the characters made this book a bit cringe. My favourite things in this book were Nolan Sawyer, the romance part and Mallory\'s little sister Darcy. She was so adorably hilarious.“Why would you keep something that makes you think of me?” I feel him shrug.“Because I think of you anyway, Mallory.”The romance was cute and adorable.It was young love and even swoon-worthy but there wasn\'t much rivalry between Mallory and Nolan like the way Ali promoted it. There were some cute amd funny moments which I absolutely adored but I did not like the way Mallory treated him sometimes. The way Nolan cared for her and made sure she got the fellowship in chess was just so precious. He wanted to play chess with her and she denied him every single time and I understand her reasons but Nolan did everything he could to earn her trust. Nolan deserves so much better. Also I hated how he was more like a side character in this book than the""actual""side characters which is the worst that could happen to a mmc.He turns us around and then we’re on the unmade bed, the twisted sheets digging into my spine. “You’ll be playing the most beautiful chess I’ve ever seen, and I dream about having you under me. It’s fucking confusing.”➸ Nolan SawyerNolan the 20 year old number one world chess player, is a millionaire, the quiet and moody boy who is secretly a cinnamon roll for Mallory, was obsessed with Mallory because he lost a match to her and wanted her and did everything to have her, wanted to play a chess match with her and even begged her for a match because only she made him feel alive, spends time with Mallory\'s family and treats them like his own, knows how to complement and treats a woman. He is a perfect man.“Are you real?” The air between us swells, overflows. “Sometimes I’m scared that I imagined you. Sometimes I think you’re only in my head.”➸ Mallory GreenleafThe oldest sibling in her family who had to take care of her two younger sisters and her mother so I\'m sure you know what I\'m trying to tell you about her here. She had family issues and mostly daddy issues and on top of that commitment issues and it took her years to finally talk about them with her family and stop hating herself for them. I didn\'t like her but I also feel like she never deserves any of the shit she went through for years.“He studies me for longer than is comfortable. Galaxies pass through his black eyes, and I wonder whether this second could last a century. Whether the universe could be just me and him, understanding each other on a forever loop.”The endingwas a""typical Ali Hazelwood ending""with a third act breakup over a misunderstanding which can be cleared by talking but as usual the Fmc is too tired, too betrayed to even listen what mmc have to say in his defense. But then she realises she made a mistake and goes back to the mmc. I already knew what was about to happen in the end.Overall this book was fine and even enjoyable sometimes. I liked how Ali tried to step out of her usual""women in stem""books and tried something different. You might love this more than me if you are able to ignore all the Gen Z refrences and all the never ending chess tournaments.“Chess is a bad idea.”“Why?”“Look where it got me.”“It got you here. To me.”'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3.5/5Listen, was it perfect? No. Did this book have too many Gen Z references, including TikTok, OnlyFans, Riverdale, AO3, Discord, and some people I don\'t want to hear about in my romance books, like Jeff Bezos, Timothée Chalamet and Cole Sprouse? Yes. Especially at the beginning, when I thought I would literally put this book down because of this. Didn\'t I particularly like the heroine? Also yes.But, did this book have Nolan Sawyer, the number one chess player in the world at only twenty years old, who was rich, the quiet and intimidating one who was obsessed with the heroine and was able to do anything for her. Yes. Nolan Sawyer, my new type and dream man? Yes, yes and yes.""He turns us around and then we’re on the unmade bed, the twisted sheets digging into my spine. “You’ll be playing the most beautiful chess I’ve ever seen, and I dream about having you under me. It’s fucking confusing.”I just feel to my knees.""His full lips tremble for the barest second. “Are you real?” The air between us swells, overflows. “Sometimes I’m scared that I imagined you. Sometimes I think you’re only in my head.”I was pretty much crying there.“Why would you keep something that makes you think of me?” I feel him shrug. “Because I think of you anyway, Mallory.”I just feel to my knees. Again.“Chess is a bad idea.”“Why?”“Look where it got me.”“It got you here. To me.”I literally blushed and screamed into my pillow. I don\'t remember the last time this happened.""I roll my eyes. “No follow-up questions.”He leans toward me over the table, dark eyes earnest, stars traveling on his skin. “Do you know how incredible you are?”If someone told me that, I would start crying.In overall this book was worth reading for one person.

take my card and do what you want with it.however, i think everyone heard that ali decided to incorporate a dictionary of references that she thought were young, funny and cool (stop that, mom), invoking timothee chalamet\'s name more times than the main character\'s ginormous hands around that small tiny coffee mug. i kept thinking to myself that this would shred my reading to pieces, but you kind of get used to it (exposure therapy maybe? idk) and the story becomes engaging enough to make you forget that nolan is considered the sexiest boy of our generation and that there are several edits of him on tiktok - and it’s probably playing end game by taylor swift as a background audio.⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆ 🎀about the characters🎀 ⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆mallory greenleaf. our main character. our chess prodigy that no longer plays. our child playing the mother role for herbrattysisters. our daughter with daddy issues and, therefore, commitment issues (go get that therapy, pet). mal is sweet, smart, funny, kind, hardworking and extremely down to earth - in another words, it’s a very hard and difficult task not to adore her and cheer for her throughout the book - which sometimes makes you want to smack her head on the table so hard that she would maybe stop being so dense and selfless -PLEASEfor once in your life be a spoiled, bitchy and ego centrical teenage girl that only thinks of herself (breathes in and out to calm herself down). once you get through that, her unconditional love for her family is, indeed, really admirable and cute, the things she gave up for them and the shitty jobs she took for them, all of her sacrifices will make your heart ache and break a little. and that’s the reason why we love to see her finding herself once again in chess - this is not a spoiler because it is painfully obvious that she will play again eventually - like it’s a chess book, someone has to play at some point, right?

cause he is - just so you know. this poor boy has had it enough, he’s tired, he’s bored, he’s almost entering an existencial mid life crisis in his teenage years - like can you imagine being so intelligent and gifted that playing chess with other grandmasters (they’re like the cool and talented kids of chess) put’s you into a sleeping coma since their moves are so predictable to you.enters mallory. who manages to wipe the floor with him (her words, not mine) during a match. the boy is whipped and he knows it. - she rizzed him up with a checkmate, who knows.⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆ ♟️about the romance♟️ ⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆it’s cute. it’s sweet. it’s swoon worthy. it’s young love. it’s legs being kicked. it’s giggles being smothered. it’s cheeks being painted crimson and scarlet red. and it’s PG 13 - don’t you go crying and booing in my doorstep, now, please, because their interactions and affectionate moments and late night conversations and “can’t keep my hands/eyes to myself” are, indeed very lovable and heartwarming and - color me surprised - enough to make you love love love the romance. do we have a third act breakup? do we have a fall out? and does it happens in the last few pages? does she run away? can’t tell you that since,duh, spoilers, but what i’ll say is that whatever happened in the end didn’t bother me and it was actually necessary for mal’s growth - so there you have it, my little spoiler munchkin.⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆ 🎀about my final thoughts🎀 ⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆as you know, it was a four stars rating for me (clap your hands and make noise) since i truly loved and enjoyed it every second of it (there were some moments though that his hands wer- never mind i got distracted) and devoured the book like i haven’t been fed in ages - almost like a small victorian child going through the bubonic plague in the mid 1300s, but it was just me in a reading slump.but, maya, the references were so annoying and uncalled for - someone whined in the crowd(plot twist: it was me whining), now, don’t you worry my child, like i said in the beginning, you really get used to it and start to brush it off eventually, promise you (and cross my heart). and i think it’s pretty obvious that i’ll be recommending this gorgeous book to my lovely gals out here, but just for the ones that tend to enjoy this cutesy type of book, the ones that love wes bennett you know - if youonlylike dark romance, this shit is not for you, bub, however, if you go both ways, then you should definitely give it a shot, it’s no”i’m-going-to-make-your-life-miserable-and-spit-on-you-and-humillate-you-but-you-must-know-that-i-love-you-secretly”(which i vouch for, as a matter of fact, and am very into it also - will always love you darius) but more of a“i-know-that-i’m-staring-at-you-like-i-hate-you-but-in-reality-i-love-everything-you-do”kind of thing.noand who tf is the girl with the “i heart rome” shirt talking to mal in the end?

And they both have academic validation so theyNEEDto get top scores and be at the top of the class and its one or the other one week is him then its her ugh iconic. THEN they get paired up together for an assessment that is like half there grade and its SUPER important and so they have to work together on a engineering project/mathmatical problem/ biochemistry reaserch paper. and slowly they get to know eachother more than just this person i need to beat and they fall in love, and while in that relationship they still have that respectful rivaly and banter we all lovenumber three: something like the love on the brain where they are in a company building setting where a bunch of different academics are creating something amazing and groubdbreaking in science, the two main characters are two completly different people, one a biologist that looks at the evolution of animals and why creatures adapted due to enviromental changes. and a mechanical engineer, the biologist (lets make him a man because hey! lets break these gender norms) and hes there to help with something idk yet this is an idea not a story dont judge me im a humble reviewer, and the womans the mechanical engineer thats there to bring the entire thing to life. they are opposites in everyway, hes all nature and the evolution of life and shes the numbers, but it works somehow they get close and together. i dont know not my best idea but i like the number three so we are running with it.why not add in more than science? sprinkle some computor coders, they deserve a love story because coding is hard, add some teachnology, people discovering ai, mathematics is always fun (said no one but me ever) that would always be so fun to look at.and while your at it add in some queer rep madetwo women in stem fall in love, now that would be iconic. 💅oh and in all of them please no galexy leggins, unicorn socks or cat hoodies please our main character is meant to be smart and sophisticated not a crazy millenial cat lady she has more important things to be doing like discovering so many new things. 💪💪as a women in science i love what you are doing, but honestly, i think you have the ability, skill and popularity to go above and beyond with your message.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'i have a feeling; imma love this book..——okay, I think she understood the assignment. THIS COVER IS GORGEOUS !'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '“God bless libraries.”I haven\'t been to a library in so long because the closest one is so far, and it makes me so sad because I love them 😭Anyways, this is my second Ali Hazelwood book, the first being The Love Hypothesis, which I adored. I really want to read Love, Theoretically, but I haven\'t gotten around to it, but I will someday. I am honestly pretty disappointed in this, since I\'ve been expecting this book since it first was announced, and since the cover was first revealed, and I was so excited!But alas｡ﾟ•┈୨♡୧┈• ｡ﾟPlotI\'m usually pretty good at reading contemporaries or romances because the plot is super easy to follow, and that\'s exactly what this was.Except for all that chess lingo. I haven\'t played chess a day in my life, and I never intend to after learning what I have in this book. The game can go on for over six hours?? That\'s not happening, I think I\'ll stick to my little checkers board thank you very much.Anyways, back to the plot, I thought it was nice and simple, and great for a quick read.Now, my complaint is the fact that sometimes, authors write YA as if it\'s a middle grade novel. This book borders on the edge of YA and New adult or adult, because while it\'s advertised as YA, and the main character is 18, some of the jokes and scenes weren\'t very YA-ish. The only thing that stopped it from being new adult was the fade to black scene. I don\'t really care, because I can\'t lie, I was disappointed when I found out this book was YA. It probably would\'ve been better if it was adult, because some of those stupid childish jokes would\'ve been cut out. I don\'t know why people think that YA is geared towards more childish jokes, YA is not only being read by children.Here are some examples! I\'m sorry.“This morning my roommate repeatedly farted on my pillow because I dared to ask her not to practice her xylophone at 5:30 am.”this one legitimately made me close my eyes, close my book, and take a deep, long breath. Fart jokes became old in elementary school, and even then, I despised them.“Unclench your butthole, Mallory.��shut up“When he swallows, his throat bobs, a strong, mesmerizing movement that I notice because . . . I’m going bananapants?”actually shut upwelcome back to elementary school kids! I hope you have a FABULOUS VISITthere were too many fart jokes to count in one scene, and it made me want to walk all the way to the lake outside my house and chuck the book into it.and want to see one of the first sentences in the book?“Mrs. Agarwal is at her desk, pretending to grade papers but probably reading Bill Nye erotic fanfiction.”well then !I will admit....some scenes made me laugh. The book did get better as it progressed, which is the reason it has 3 stars instead of 2 ☺Oh, and I know Ali Hazelwood gets talked about for always making her male characters huge and her female characters tiny, so I tallied out how many times Nolan was described in any way as ""big"" or big compared to the main character, and I have concluded that it was around 13. Take that information and do what you will.Also, there were so many pop culture references in this that it was crazy. TikTok was mentioned a few times, and I didn\'t really care, which was surprising, but it got annoying to an extent, and then Taylor Swift was mentioned, but of course I didn\'t mind that, have you seen the Taylor\'s Version in my name? There were a lot of other bands and modern stuff, and this is why I stick to fantasy, where none of this is ever mentioned 😌 (I will admit, I liked the talk about Timothée Chalamet, only because I had his statistics song stuck in my head.)do not get me started on the Percy Jackson reference, I\'m trying to wipe it from my memory please and THANK YOU. I don\'t remember it all, but there\'s some about reading erotic Percy Jackson fanfics and having him and someone sixty-nine. I\'m not ok at the moment, save Percy.I don\'t remember who he\'s doing that with, I\'d rather not know anyways“because when I asked myself if I had the right to those tears, the answer was always no, and it was easy to stop myself.”shut the hell upSorry if I run out of quotes halfway through the review, there\'s like none in the quotes section and I don\'t want to go back into the book.｡ﾟ•┈୨♡୧┈• ｡ﾟThe CharactersI hated Mallory so much in the beginning of the book. She was getting on my nerves with her stupid attitude. I get that she was going through a lot, and I understand that, but she was so negative that even I, the queen of negativity, was flabbergasted. She believed the worst of everyone and everything, and it happened so often that I wanted to scream. Thankfully, she got better, like way better, and the end of the book. We love a good character development.Now Nolan\'s situation is complicated for me, because I\'deasilyfall in love with him, BUT, that is also the name of a close family member to me 😃 so let me tell you, my inner conflict was going crazy during certain parts of the story, because I loved him as a character, I love the tall, dark, and handsomes, especially when they\'re mysterious and cold, but I just couldn\'t get past that his name was someone I was related to! For this reason, he will not be added to my list of book boyfriends.I really liked the side characters, and Oz was the best character hands down. When he told Mallory off, I was grinning so hard because he was just saying facts and putting that girl in her place, and it was so satisfying.SABRINA WAS A BITCH THOUGH. I don\'t care if she\'s fourteen years old and some fourteen year olds are bitches, but she was so rude, I couldn\'t stand it.“I think about a deserted chessboard. Only the white king on it, standing on the home square. Alone, untethered, safe from threats. Free to roam.”｡ﾟ•┈୨♡୧┈• ｡ﾟThe RomanceI will admit, I did find the romance quite cute. A tad unrealistic, a tad fast, but it\'d make me boring if I nit-picked based on just those two things, so I\'ll let it slide. The tension between them was pretty well created, and some of their scenes actually made me giggle, which is the best thing ever in a romance book.Of course, this book also came with the good ol\' second act drama. I think it was kind of a miscommunication, but Mallory also really overreacted, because based on her need for money at the time, I don\'t see why she would\'ve gotten upset, or maybe I\'m just not that kind of person 😭I\'m also quite annoyed at the fact that we didn\'t get a solid reunion at the end. I had to read a ""two years later"" epilogue written in NEWSPAPER FORM. I DON\'T CARE I WANT TO SEE THEM INTERACTING AS AN ACTUAL COUPLE.｡ﾟ•┈୨♡୧┈• ｡ﾟoverall, unless you love YA that\'s on the way way upper side of YA but also has a ton of elementary school jokes that will make you want to throw the book into a lake and has a main character that you want to throw in the lake with said book, I\'d recommend skipping on this one.save yourselfthis review made me angry, so I\'m deducting my rating to 2.5 stars2.5 starsInstead of putting a quote, I will be putting all of the pop culture references I found while flipping through again!

I think she did it well.Yes, there’s innumerable references to everything popular right now, but I don’t think anything actually made me cringe.The chess part of the plot (as someone who knows less than nothing about chess) wasinteresting. I may not have understood all the terminology (what IS the Grünfeld) but I got the gist of it.The actual plot itself felt very cozy to me. Not a lot happened, there were more thoughts and feelings than anything else, and it was just really sweet.Ali’s books always tend to be quick reads, but I almost didn’t want to put this down, and if I haven’t had things to do...I definitely would have finished it in just a few hours.The characters were quite easily my favourite part, even though Ididwant to slap a particular sister once or twice.Mallory, the protagonist, felt very relatable to me. Maybe it’s because we’re both the oldest sister, maybe it’s because she (like me) has the unfortunate habit of trying to do everything herself, but all I know is that I really enjoyed her perspective.The only thing that could have made this book better isNolanhaving a POV. Tall, sarcastic men who don’t know how to function in society are always my favourites, so it’s no surprise I loved him.Emil and Tanuwere good side characters, and (if a little annoying at times) quite sweet.AndOz? I lost count of the times he made me laugh, with his threats and general grouchiness.All together, they’re the cast for a book I can only describe asadorable.————quotes————“Why would you keep something that makes you think of me?”“Because I think of you anyway, Mallory.”“He told me once that sometimes, with some people, it's not about winning or losing, That with some people, it's just about playing. Though for the longest time, I didn't really believe him.”“He’s tireless, unshakable. Driven in an indomitable, near- obsessive way. This iron- hard tenacity of his is an oddly attractive quality.”“I feel protected from attacks from all sides. Like the king during good chess.”“Even the good ones, they don’t know how it feels. They don’t know what it’s like, being told that you’re inherently destined to be second best.”“I resign. You win. Can I kiss you?”“I fall asleep mid game—for the second time in my life held by someone, for the second time in my life held by Nolan Sawyer.”“I’m going to fall over. Or I’ll be fine, here in his lap.”———random extra thoughts———I literally keep staring at the cover 😭 it’s so pink and cuteThanks for reading! ❤️""}]"

They’re beautiful as blades forged in some divine fire. They will live forever.And Cardan is even more beautiful than the rest. I hate him more than all the others. I hate him so much that sometimes when I look at him, I can hardly breathe.Jude was seven when her parents were murdered and she and her two sisters were stolen away to live in the treacherous High Court of Faerie. Ten years later, Jude wants nothing more than to belong there, despite her mortality. But many of the fey despise humans. Especially Prince Cardan, the youngest and wickedest son of the High King.To win a place at the Court, she must defy him–and face the consequences.As Jude becomes more deeply embroiled in palace intrigues and deceptions, she discovers her own capacity for trickery and bloodshed. But as betrayal threatens to drown the Courts of Faerie in violence, Jude will need to risk her life in a dangerous alliance to save her sisters, and Faerie itself.","[{'rating': 5, 'content': ""“He looks like a faerie lover stepped out of a ballad, the kind where no good comes to the girl who runs away with him.”If you guys ever want to see what my true heart’s desires are on paper, read this book. This book is a piece of heaven that was sent from above, this book is the perfection incarnate, this book is nothing short of magical, this book easily makes my top five books of all-time list, and this book is without a doubt the best book I’ve read in 2017. I’m not sure how I’m even going to attempt to come up with a review fitting for this masterpiece, but I’m going to try.Okay, maybe I should start this review off with a personal story. You know, full disclosure and all that. I was a young girl, at the mall with my mom, and we walked into a Borders Outlet. I’ve always been a rather ravenous reader, but at that time in my reading life I was reading only crime thrillers. Think things like James Patterson and John Grisham. Well, while I was perusing the new releases on this autumn day back in the 2007, a worker came up to me and started talking to me about her love for books, but more importantly her love for fae books. She was so kind and warm and enthusiastic, I couldn’t help but ask her to pick me one of her favorite fae stories. Well, she ended up handing me two, but one of them wasTitheby Holly Black, and this godsend Borders Outlet employee completely changed me and my reading life forever.After that day, and after I inhale read that book, Holly Black became one of my favorite authors and my parents couldn’t keep unread fae fantasy books on my shelves. And ten years later, I’ve never looked back. I’ve been completely obsessed with fae stories ever since. And if I ever develop magical powers, one of the first thing I’m going to do is track down that Borders Outlet employee and thank her for making me the reader that I am today.Okay, sappy and heartwarming story aside, this book was honestly perfection in every aspect. You want fae courts? Bloodthirsty fae royals fighting for a crown? Twists after twists and reveals after reveals? Heartwarming scenes followed by heart wrenching scenes? The slowest and most agonizing but also the most romantic and powerful and rewarding hate to love romance in the world? Pick this book up.“Because you’re like a story that hasn’t happened yet. Because I want to see what you will do. I want to be part of the unfolding of the tale.”And the writing? I mean, not only is Holly Black the literal queen of all things fae, she is also the queen at stringing together words that make me feel everything in the entire universe. The amount of sticky notes and highlights I have in this book is ridiculous, but Holly Black’s writing is so poignant and lyrical and honestly the most perfect thing my eyes have ever seen. This entire book reads like one giant tragic ballad, yet it is equal parts heartbreak and hope. This book is so haunting, so dark, and so twisted.“But I will not stand in front of your happiness. I will not even stand in front of misery that you choose for yourself.”Jude is a very young girl when she witnesses her parents murder. After that terrible night, she and her sisters are whisked away by the murderer to live in Faerie. Now, ten years later, Jude is trying to live among the fae, while constantly being reminded of her mortal human status. Yet, she soon gets wrapped up in a very elaborate game, from many different sides, which will cause a civil war to break out in the Courts of Faerie if the game isn’t played properly.The High King has ruled for centuries, but people feel like it is finally time for him to step down and give the royal crown to one of his children. In this world, the king chooses his successor; it doesn’t automatically go to the oldest child. And the High King has six children in line waiting for him to make his choice.Prince Cardan is the youngest son of the High King. He is wicked, and charming, and smart, and maybe even a little cruel. Oh, and he makes Jude’s life a living hell most of the time. He’s also one of the best characters I’ve ever read in my entire life.And with Cardan, comes his group of friends: Nicasia who likes power, Valerian who likes violence, and Locke who likes dramatics, but they all love tormenting Jude in very different ways.“That’s what comes of hungering for something; you forget to check if it’s rotten before you gobble it down”Even though Jude is the only point of view, and is the main protagonist of this amazing story, her two sisters play a huge part of this story, too. Taryn is Jude’s twin, who must watch all the torment that Jude endures, and Vivi is their older sister and one of the best side characters I’ve ever read. She’s unique and defiant and strong and devoted, and her romance with her girlfriend meant everything to me. Also, Vivi is on the page bisexual and that representation meant even more than everything to me.Oh, and speaking of adorable queer relationships; Ben and Severin, fromThe Darkest Part of the Forest, make a cameo in this and I was crying the happiest tears! I don’t think I will ever be over THAT whisper, and I’ve just completely accepted that. Be still, my heart.But Jude is our main character of this story, and you can tell from everything that I’ve written above that she doesn’t have the easiest of lives. See, the fae in this world are very dependent on humans, even though they remind them of their lower status constantly, because the fae women have a very hard and sporadic time conceiving and bearing children, therefore, they rely on humans reproducing for them. Well, Jude doesn’t want that life, she wants to make a name for herself and be one of the greatest knights that the Courts of Faerie have ever seen!Jude is strong willed and very determined, but she is also one of the most selfless characters I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading from. She is a very morally grey character, yet she will completely capture your heart. But she’s young and learning that love comes in very different forms, and sometimes we are unable to control what we feel.“I stand in front of my window and imagine myself a fearless knight, imagine myself a witch who hid her heart in her finger and then chopped her finger off.”One of the most beautiful things about this book is that none of these characters are perfect. Jude, Cardan, all of them do bad things, and none of them are ever excused of their crimes, but they learn to deal with them and the other ramifications that come from their actions. I mean, none of us are perfect people, and we all make bad choices at times. But this book accepts that and reflects that, but also highlights the importance of growing, and becoming a stronger person, and picking what battles you choose to fight. It’s a truly beautiful message and I really appreciated having a full cast of nonperfect characters that do nonperfect things.“But we all want stupid things. That doesn’t mean we should have them.”Also, this is a spoiler free review, but I just have toyell from the rooftopssay that Chapter 26 is the best chapter I’ve read in all of literature. I will fight anyone that says otherwise. Chapter 26 tortured me, broke up, killed me, rebirthed me, and gave me new life. The end of Chapter 25 through Chapter 26 was the most romantic scene my eyes have ever witnessed. I feel so blessed to have even been able to read those glorious paragraphs. Like, I’m a different person after experiencing Chapter 26. When I’m sad or hurt or angry, I’m going to reread Chapter 26 so I know the true meaning of this life.“…like taking a dare to run over knives, like an adrenaline strike of lighting, like the moment when you’ve swum too far out in the sea and there is no going back, only cold black water closing over your head.”Also, fair warning, this book has a cliffhanger ending that puts all other cliffhanger endings to shame. Just typing that sentence gave me full body goosebumps, by the way! Oh, and the title of this book is absolute perfection, as well.This book has touched me in a way that very few books have in my life. This is the type of book that reminds me why I fell in love with reading in the first place. This is the type of book that makes me believe words have the most powerful healing magic of anything in this world. This is the type of book that completely sets my soul on fire and makes me feel utterly enchanted. I just know thatThe Cruel Princeis a once in a lifetime series, because this first installment was everything I have ever wanted in a book.Holly Black immerses me, captivates me, and makes me believe in magic. I have no words of gratitude for that, and I’m not sure what the world has done to deserve her stories, but I will forever be grateful. Holly Black helps me forget all the actual cruel princes in our world today, and their terrible choices that they are making for all of us. And honestly, I’d be super surprised if she isn’t an actual fae queen, that just escaped faerie to torture us with real stories that went on while she was ruling.Again, if you can only preorder one book for the rest of the year, please pickThe Cruel Princeby Holly Black. It’s not only my favorite book of the year, it’s one of my favorite books of all time. And then read the rest of Holly Black’s work, because her books are truly the closest thing to magic and each is a tangible vessel of joy that I have an an unconditional amount of love for.“If I cannot be better than them, I will be so much worse.”Blog|Twitter|Tumblr|Instagram|Youtube|TwitchContent warningsfor bullying, talk of suicide, and abuse.The quotes above were taken from an ARC and are subject to change upon publication.(Thank you so much,Diana.

And rereading this was truly the best holiday gift I could have ever given myself. ❤""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '4.5/5 ⭐Full review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolf🐺“(…) cheekbones sharp enough to cut out a girl’s heart.”I love me a cruel and tipsy Faerie prince and that’s Cardan and only Cardan.I mean everything I said in the previous sentence. Every. Word. Is. True.Cardan was the best thing happening to this book and if you deny this that that’s strictly your problem. He’s a charmer.*I don’t read hyper-hyped books in general. But when I do, I read them aeons after they’re out so the hype has worn out and I can enjoy the book (or not) in peace. This one was super hyped. I was plainly curious to see if it really is worth a shot.I truly didn’t expect the beginning of the book toscreamlike that. That was a power move. And I liked it.Everything that came after that was to lure us into the Faerie world, of what, I must admit, I have only a minimum knowledge of. Everyone is beautiful, but everyone is cruel. Basically, it looks like a circus.It is important for me to be able to grasp the world from the beginning. I feel frustrated when the whole universe unravels as if I just dropped in the middle of what was going on and no one had the time to acknowledge me.I want to feel important from the beginning.Thank you, Holly Black, I did feel important!“Being born mortal is like being born already dead.”This is the story of sisters. Vivienne, Jude and Taryn are three sisters who began their lives in the mortal world and but then were forced to come to Elfhame after their parents got brutally murdered by their soon-to-be foster father – Vivienne’s real father. Vivi is one of them; Jude and Taryn, the twins, are not. This is the story of the sisters’ struggle to be accepted in a world that doesn’t want them to be part of.Although Jude and Taryn are twins, they are completely different from each other. Where Taryn is ladylike and delicate, silent and obedient, Jude is determined and loud and wild. Where Taryn wants to be granted a place in the Faerie world through marriage, Jude wants to be a knight and play at war.The story is narrated from Jude’s point of view. That is probably why many people find her annoying. The whole story sounds like her own roaring thoughts and feelings. Maybe she annoys herself too as many of us get annoyed with ourselves and our own thoughts.“You’re like a story that hasn’t happened yet.”In a purely honest note, I kind of liked Jude in this book. Sure, she was a bit annoying sometimes, but truth be said, I liked her better than Taryn. There was something about her twin sister that made me repel her. Jude was interesting in a way that made me relate to her. I could totally see me sometimes in her actions. I felt like she was full of her own personality.She’s power-thirsty. But this is how she was raised to be. To fight, to scheme, to seek and seize power. She’s the foster daughter of the great general of the Faerie after all. I still consider that a badass trait about her. Don’t you think?Now, as I previously stated, I think I might have a soft spot for Cardan, the youngest Prince of the Faerie.“There’s safety in being awful.”Cardan Greenbriar might seem cruel, reckless, thirsty for violence, but I think he is totally the good boy in disguise type. I mean, at first, I couldn’t stand him (even though I hated his friends more than I despised him). Then, there was this period of transition where I had mixed feelings about him. 65% in and I just slowly but steadily started to fall in love with him. I started to realise things about him as presented by his actual, intimate actions. And how couldn’t I fall like a fool? He was a lonely and broken boy. All he wanted was to love and be loved, but no one seemed to care about him enough to grant him that little. What is the whole power in the world of Faerie without an ounce of affection to it?“Most of all, I hate you because I think of you. Often. It’s disgusting and I can’t stop.”He hates. Hates because he loves. Hate because he’s not loved.His relationship with Jude starts and unfolds slowly. They have that wonderful love-to-hate relationship that I actually enjoy in books in general.I consider their relationship a bit unhealthy though. What happens between the two of them is a peculiar kind of hate-love. It’s a game played out of spite. It’s all about power and desire. I am not sure this is right, but I do believe that this type of relationship is going to improve because from hate to love to hate to love again – that’s an endless wheel that could be stopped anytime, anywhere. One can make a beautiful thing out of something hideous, but one can also ruin the beauty of a thing. Their relationship, in this book, is dangerous ground.Indeed, something about the book seemed off. Even though the world-building was very good and the action was fantastic, the depth of the characters was somehow missing. I wanted them to be more individualised, but I think that’s just because we see the story through only one character’s point of view. When you personalise the action, it’s hard to create well-developed individuals.That, I think, it’s the only contradictory thing I have to say about this book. Really. I even enjoyed all the bloodshed there. And that’s not okay. But it was so cleverly crafted that I justhad toenjoy it somehow??____________________________________________Also see:#2.The Wicked King(⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)#3.The Queen of Nothing(⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '*clears throat*Excuse me, uh. Who cares?This is not a rhetorical question. I truly want to know. I read this whole ass book and I am still at a complete loss for something, anything, to care about. Not a plot point, not a character trait, not a single line of quirky banter I could get myself emotionally invested in.https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...This is a book about fairies and it was a trial for me to get through. Me, a person who loves fairies so much she spent her entire third grade year absolutely convinced, in a non-ironic manner, that she was one.It doesn’t get much more dream audience for this book than me. And I couldn’t give two sh*ts, or one sh*t, or even a fraction of a sh*t, for so much as a moment. So. Who among you was able to pull off such a feat?Okay, to be fair, maybe I’m not the dream audience. Holly Black and I have a rocky past. I grew up on the Spiderwick books (well, mostly the Field Guide, which I used as a means of learning about my own species. See the above “I thought I was a fairy” admission). ButThe Coldest Girl in Coldtownis one of 9 books I’ve DNFed in my entire goddamn life, andThe Darkest Part of the Forestwas another snoozefest.Ilikecharacter-driven stories. I like slow books with beautiful writing. But I don’t like Holly Black characters, and I don’t love Holly Black’s writing, and basically all of her books put me to sleep every time. And also make me feel like I’m reading the exact same book over and over. Seriously, they all read the same. Including Spiderwick, which is shocking because that 1) is middle grade and 2) has a good deal less sexual tension than a lot of her other stuff.Anyway.This book was so, so boring.Nothing really happens until past the 200-page mark, and by then everything is so silly and ridiculous that I was mostly along for the ride. What, you say? More of the synopsis is out the window? We’re just deleting more character development from our brains? Delightful.Because, again, who cares.I know a lot of people love this book because they love Jude. I don’t know why they love Jude. Is she supposedly “strong” or “powerful” or “badass” or one of those words we assign to characters when there isn’t much to describe? Because I’m not seeing anything to fall in love with.I know a lot of people love this book because they love Cardan. I know exactly why they love Cardan. It is because he is one of three or four YA boy character archetypes that draw in blatant adoration (and delightful fan art) from readers WITHOUT. FAIL.Basically, here are the acceptable YA male traits. You pick a combination of these, and you have your flat, uninteresting, repeat character.- handsome OR beautiful OR hot- funny OR mysterious OR charming- banter-y OR bully-y OR flirtyAnd that’s it. I often like the handsome/funny/banter-y archetype. From time to time, I’ll enjoy a hot/charming/flirty one.I always, always, always hate the beautiful/mysterious/bully-y one. I hated Will Herondale, and boy oh boy do I hate Cardan.And I know a lot of people love this book because of the plot and the world. But the plot to me was nonexistent, because for 200 pages this book largely made me drag myself through it, with no action or momentum to pull me along. And the world is just Every Holly Black Book But With A Slight Twist, Maybe. And that world hasn’t worked for me since I was nine and thought myself a resident, my dear boy.Bottom line: I guess the thing with Holly Black is that if one book works for you, they all will. But baby, that goes both ways!---------------pre-reviewthis book is...lame.review to come!!!---------------currently-reading updatesbuddy reading this withlilyandmayand we are definitely all thriving and having a good time. no rage or boredom involved at all---------------tbr reviewjust received official word that i WILL be excommunicated from goodreads if i do not have this book on my shelves'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Jan 2023:Still impossible to put down and I know what happens!! Gotta say, I\'m glad I didn\'t reread this before readingThe Stolen Heirbecause that one would have paled in comparison. Nothing quite like Jude & Cardan.No matter how careful I am, eventually I\'ll make another misstep. I am weak. I am fragile. I am mortal.I hate that most of all.Over the course of this year, I\'ve read both books that I\'ve liked and books I\'ve disliked. I\'ve read books that I\'ve loved and, it\'s fair to say, books that are better written, more unique, and more groundbreaking than this book. That being said, however, I am struggling to recall a book that has left me this excited about a YA series in a very long time.It seems like forever since I read a completely juicy YA fantasy with just the right amount ofdrama, action, surprises, nastiness and the tiniest hints at romantic possibility. The wait for the next book is going to be torture!Holly Black knows her audience so well. She\'s not kind to us because she knows we don\'t really want that anyway. So of courseThe Cruel Princeopens with a brutal murder that leaves Jude, her twin sister Taryn, and their older sister Vivienne at the mercy of the redcap general - Madoc. Jump to ten years later, and the three sisters are all living in Faerie. They\'ve been raised as Madoc\'s own, more or less, and each is trying to find her own place among the beautiful but cruel, deceitful but always honest, fey.For Vivi, return to the human world is the answer. For Taryn, assimilation and playing by the rules is the only way. For our narrator - Jude - rebellion, bloodshed and winning her place in the King\'s council is what she desires.Nicasia\'s wrong about me. I do not desire to do as well in the tournament as one of the fey. I want to win. I do not yearn to be their equal.In my heart, I yearn to best them.It is extremely compelling. Even before the real drama kicks off in the later chapters, I was so wholly pulled into Jude\'s world. The bullying she endures at the hands of her fey classmates adds a heavy dose of unfairness to keep you pissed enough to turn the pages. Then we get to the spying, secrets, betrayals, side-switching and, oh wow, can I just have the next book please?In truth, not a single character is entirely likeable. All are complex, more than a little flawed, and nobody can be trusted. Even Jude. It\'s really quite wonderful. Cardan, the ""cruel prince"" from the title, is an asshole. A drunken, bullying, selfish asshole. And yet... and yet. We shall see.In case it wasn\'t obvious,I loved it. All the drama is absolutely delicious and, while Black does draw on some familiar tropes, the world, characters and politics feel fresh in her hands. It charges to a climax full of surprises and the ending doesn\'t disappoint. Nicely wrapped up but with enough to leave me desperate for the next instalment. I can\'t wait!""Nice things don\'t happen in storybooks,"" Taryn says. ""Or when they do happen, something bad happens next. Because otherwise the story would be boring, and no one would read it.""Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""New week,New BookTube Video- all about the best (and worst) literary couplesThe Written ReviewIf I cannot be better than them, I will become so much worse.Jude (and her twin, Taryn) are human but their older sister (Vivi)belonged to another world.Their mother fled when she was pregnant with Vivi and escaped to the human world.

The buzz it ignites is amazing. They create this excitement within you that has your mind wandering to all of the possibilities and direction the book can go in.Because of the hype, I assumed I would enjoy this book. I'm quite an easy-to-please reader, so usually when a book is hyped up, I tend to enjoy it. Or even if I don't, I will feel indifferent. But this book brought about a rage within me; I hated it with every fibre of my being.You may be thinking that because of the fact I 'succumbed' to the hype, it ruined the experience for me. That was not the case at all. I always go in weary, but with a sense of optimism when it comes to hyped books.As for the book, well, everything was wrong with it for me. Other than the slight addictive quality it had - which died for me after I passed the halfway point - this book was weak in every sense of the word. From the protagonist, to the characters, the plot and the world building. There was no development or growth that brought those aspects to live, not even the writing.The story-line started off quite tragic, with Jude's parents being brutally killed off from the bat. From that, I was expecting some kind of revenge story, or emotionally harrowing character development, because to witness that when you're young will obviously take a toll.But no. That wasn't explored. Right off the bat, our main character goes on to enter some kind of tournament she has no experience in whatsoever. There's nothing ingrained within her to take on this challenge, no power she embodies, intellectually or physically. Whilst it took place, all I kept thinking about was how flimsy the battle was, neither did it feel complete. Just rushed.Thus this was the narrative the story carried on. Our main character had no proper background that we as readers were exposed to in order for us to connect with, no experience, and neither had she trained to gain any of it throughout the course of the book. Everything was just thrown (characters and world) at the reader, and felt as if we were expected to go with the flow and further clarification was not given or explained. Event after event took place with no sense of proper progression of the overall plot. No aspect to it whatsoever felt substantial or concrete.I got angrier as I read on and when it got to the last 50 odd pages, I refused to carry on, because I couldn't bring myself to care one bit. It wasn't that it was even mediocre; the whole book felt pointless to me.INITIAL REACTION REVIEW:Well, I'm pretty sure my soul just died. No, it is dead.I haven't hated a book this much since Caraval and I don't tend to hate books that often. I'm indifferent most of the time, and I do enjoy a lot of the ones I read. But this... god. I have no words.Review to come when I can feel again.Ugh.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I do not yearn to be their equal. In my heart, I yearn to best them.Wow, what a start to the trilogy! I'm not sure what I expected going intoThe Cruel Prince, but it certainly wasn't this much fun or this much nastiness.Jude was only seven years old when her parents were brutally murdered in front of her eyes. The man who killed them took her and her sisters to the High Court of Faerie, to be brought up as one of them. Yet, in the ten years since, Jude has never felt like she belonged. As a mortal, she is always less than in the eyes of the Faeries. In particular, she makes an enemy of the cruel Prince Cardan. When treachery comes to the High Court, Jude must figure out what she's really capable of in order to grab the power she so desires.Right off the bat, it's clear that every character in here is somewhat morally corrupt, including our heroine Jude. To survive and thrive, they must continually scheme and do bad things. While I don't normally gravitate towards this sort of story, it works here because everyone's motivations make sense. I feel an emotional connection with each character, so I'm able to cheer them on, even as their actions become crazier and more questionable. It sure makes for an entertaining read, one I can't look away from.The writing is truly top-notch, with a sharpness that keeps me on my toes. I particularly enjoyed the dialogue, which is so witty and scathing that it feels like every line is worth savoring and rereading. The worldbuilding is easy and effortless, drawing the reader seamless into this universe. It proceeds bit by bit, so there's never any confusion or info dumping. And the way every tidbit eventually fits together is satisfying to the extreme.There's so much packed into this one story: politics, family drama, revenge, power, and murder. There's even a bit of romantic intrigue disguised as mutual hate, which is quite delicious. Everything builds up slowly, increasing in tension until we reach a turning point about halfway through. After that, the gloves are off, and we are treated to one surprise after another. I never knew what the next chapter would bring, so I was turning the pages as fast as I could.When I think of a fantasy story I want to sink my teeth into, I'm looking for a few things: sharp writing, well-plotted story, compelling characters, and seamless worldbuilding. And if there's a dash of romance, I certainly wouldn't object. Well, this book has them all, and I'm in awe over how flawlessly everything came together. I can't wait for more.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:#2.The Wicked King~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'I absolutely cannot believe I wasted time out of my freaking life to read this ""book"". I don\'t get the hype and I hate how relationships are portrayed in the story! Authors and reviewers here on Goodreads that Itrustedtrust raved about this book .... and I\'m here lighting the fire so I can burn the pages.....First of all... the writing is horrendous. It\'s the worst case of ""tell, not show"" I\'ve ever seen (Twilight was better written than this): ""I did this, she did that, now I\'m gonna do this ..."". There was no emotion in the writing, I did not feel any attachment toward the world of ""Faerieland"" and I couldn\'t connect with the protagonist, Jude,because I wanted to slap some sense into her the entire time: she acts recklessly, even when other peoplewarn her repeatedly not to do the thingand for the first 200 pages shedoes nothing but complain, indulging in a self-pity party like there is no tomorrow.My heart bleeds0_0.Continuing - the other characters are 2D, the plot is non-existent for the first 200+ pages and the grand finale/epilogue everyone\'s been raving about....left me colder than a dead body dropped in Siberia.I could not care less.An issue that had me concerned while reading this: the character who is heavily hinted as being the love interest:almost every scene in which he makes an appearance showcases how abusive he is, especially towards the MC and no one (from the reviews I have read) flags this as a major problem?. I have little patience for female (and male, for that matter) authors who write abusive love interests and thenabsolve them of all the nasty acts they have perpetrated. In the world of endemic sexual harassment and abusive behaviour, in the world of #metoo and the horrifying stories of women being treated like less than dirt,why do we fall for this type of characters? Why do we keep buying these books? And why do we praise the authors who write them???????.I\'ve wasted enough electricity writing a review for a book that will surely be my worst read of the year.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Absolutely loved this read!! A wondrous fantasy novel that is easy to get invested in. So many great plot twists and high-intensity, suspenseful moments!TW: murder, physical abuse, sexual abuse, suicideHolly Black is truly the queen of creating exquisite worlds. Her interpretation of faeries is always so fascinating and glorious. It’s hard to fully capture what it is about her world-building that is so magical, but her books are always my favorite when it comes to faeries. I believe a part of it is that she flawlessly captures the danger and darkness of fey while also displaying the beauty of their magic. There are few words to accurately describe her talent for writing intriguing and beautiful fantasy worlds.I really enjoyed the characters in this story. Jude is a great protagonist – her fierceness is complimented by her vulnerability, which makes her very realistic considering her circumstances. The relationships between characters are also fascinating, especially the family dynamics. The way Jude views her sisters and “adoptive” family are very unique in my opinion.I also enjoyed the fact that this is not a romance novel. Though it is weaved in here and there, I feel the overarching plot becomes full of politics as the story progress. I will admit, I did lose focus at sometimes while listening to the audiobook because so much of this novel is centered on political relationships, the complications of monarchies, dynamics between different courts, and plotting to overthrow. That being said, it is so well developed and different from many YA books that I overall had a great experience with in.In total, The Cruel Prince was fantastic. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in fantasy, faeries, political intrigue, or just an all-around immersive novel.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Please enjoy the following visual presentation of my reactions whilst readingThe Cruel Prince:((cue the Muzak)):This wasNOTHINGat all like what I expected it to be.

HELLO! YES! how can a book that is short and straight forward in writing pack such a big punch. this is no SJM, overly complicated and long bullshit. holly black writes with intention.- the family... the theme of family in this was amazing. jude's relationship with madoc and her sisters was so realistic and nuanced that i felt like it could have existed in real life. i loved it.- the world... somehow it slipped past me in the description of this book but this is set in present day. there are malls and mcdonalds in the human world. how fucking cool is that??? super cool juxtaposition with the seemingly antiquated fae world.- jude... sweetie. you are awesome. you are a bad ass. your feelings are so fcking valid. also the way her feelings about cardan are described in this book... perfection. i seriously related to her which is rare. why are females in books so damn annoying usually? idk but jude IS NOT.- CARDAN... i mean do i really have to explain this one? he's perfect.

Someone please revive me because I am dead from the awesomeness of this book.If you want to read a masterpiece of character and story, look no further. The Cruel Prince showcases Holly Black at the top of her game: it is exquisitely dark and delightfully wicked, set in an intricate world of highlighted sensation--the taste of faerie fruit, the feel of rich, decaying fabrics, the smells of dangerous old chambers--and populated by a cast of characters that left me dying from feels. I mean, seriously. Jude is a *glorious* lead: a shrewd and determined survivor with exactly the kind of cunning that I love. YES. And then there are her sisters! Cardan! The princes of Faerie! Her complex family! As always, Holly's language is as precise as it is beautiful, and I frequently found myself pausing to reread turns of phrases because each could pack so much into so few words.AND THAT ENDING.

This book.I\'m kind of surprised at how much I enjoyed THE CRUEL PRINCE. It was receiving a lot of hype, and normally that turns me off, because so much of the hype surrounding books these days seemssomanufactured. I\'m really sick of seeing everyone post aesthetic pictures of certain books and say, ""OMG! THIS IS SO GREAT! LIFE CHANGING! WOW!"" and then I go, ""Oh really?"" and pick it up, like a sucker, and find out that the book is not greatorlife-changing but incredibly mediocre or, worse, bad and just basically more of the same.THE CRUEL PRINCE is that 1book out of 100 that deserves all the hype. Faeries are portrayed as they\'resupposedto be: not Greek gods with convenient magical powers that spend all their time acting like life is one big fat reality TV show, but actual scary, power-hungry creatures who are terrifying as they are beautiful to behold. Jude and her sisters, Taryn and Vivi, find that out the hard way when one of them bursts into their door in the mortal world andmurders both her parents. It turns out that their mother was previously married - to a fae - and he didn\'t take kindly to cheating.But leaving behind orphans leaves a sour taste in Madoc (jealous faerie ex-husband)\'s mouth so he brings back all three of them to be reared in the world of faerie, where they\'re treated in his household like minor Gentry and resented by pretty much everyone else. Including the Elite 4 - *cough* - I mean the Faerie ""Plastics"": Nicasia, Locke, Valerian, and Cardan. Jude, not knowing when to stand down or keep her mouth shut, ends up bearing the brunt of their humiliations and intimidation tactics, and instead of learning a lesson, she ends up feeling nothing but rage and a desire for revenge.For about 1/3 of this book, it felt like another YA fantasy drama with a mortal girl who ends up biting off more than she can chew with a side-romance that feels tepid. Then about 2/3 in, things start to get really crazy, with court intrigue, espionage, betrayal, murder, poison, and yes, okay, illicit romance. The last 100 pages of this book got even better, and the last fifty had me going ""OMG!!!!"" I received an electronic copy of this book for review, but rest assured, had I been holding a physical copy, I would have been white-knuckling it in a death grip even the most dedicated wrestler would admire.I think this book\'s biggest failing is actually the genre. It\'s forced to dial down the cruelty, the sexuality, and the violence, so sometimes the tone feels a little off. THE HUNGER GAMES, as much as I loved it, had the same problem. YA is still very puritanical, with good reason, butsometimes when authors try to push the envelope within the confines of the parameters set by the age group they\'re writing for, certain topics can feel either unexplored or disconcertingly tame.I almost feel like this would have been better written for an adult audience, with older characters.That small qualm aside, I really enjoyed THE CRUEL PRINCE. I enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed THE HUNGER GAMES and VAMPIRE ACADEMY. I loved that Jude started off selfish and kind of petulant, and gradually learned to hone her cruelty and her callousness into a very successful weapon. I like it when heroines are powerful and dangerous and morally grey, and given roles typically given to male characters in the genre. I also loved the dark prince, Cardan. He and Jude have a real ""Reylo"" dynamic, and I foresee a ""Fifty Shades of Fae"" sequel somewhere down the line for them. #YaassP.S. Still not sure if I mentioned THAT I HATE TARYN A LOT? :D :DP.P.S. Not sure if I understand all the need for subterfuge in the court. Everyone made a big deal of how faeries can\'t lie, so why not just line everyone up and say ""Are you scheming against me or participating in schemes against me, either directly or indirectly?"" and then kill anyone who says ""yes"" or refuses to answer? Why go through all the rigamarole of involving extra spies? See, I\'m a mortal and I\'d make a better faerie ruler than half these losers. #ACourtOfSmutAndCommonSenseThanks to Netgalley/the publisher for the review copy!5 stars'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Cardan Greenbriar holds my heart in his hands, and he looks rather smug about it, theabsolutely perfectinsufferable jerk.This is one of those books where the faerie are actually scary. Yes, they're pretty immature, but they're cruel, terrible people who play with mortals for fun. These are not your Sarah J. Maas fae. They can't control the wind or change shapes -- but they can force humans to do their will, which is almost worse. Unless you wrap a string of rowan berries around your neck or turn your stockings inside-out.Jude and Cardan are characters that make the plot seem like a side thing. I could watch them fold laundry and be perfectly content. Their dynamic is the best thing I've seen since Rowaelin. I noticed farther along that Jude and Cardan are literally just genderswapped versions of each other. She pretends like Cardan is the worst person ever, but just compare them, and you'll see what I mean. They both crave power over others. They both deceive each other without a second thought. It's the perfect love-hate relationship.And that's why I don't think it's problematic. I've seen reviews criticizing Jurdan, but they both tormented each other. Jude ultimately betrayed Cardan in the end. This is one of those relationships where they'll either get married or kill each other. (Please don't kill each other. I love you both too much.)I would welcome Cardan to the part of my heart specifically set aside for cinnamon rolls, but he would probably burn the whole thing down while muttering something about decomposing mortals. Sam Cortland could never.I'm just going to stand here in awe while all of you actually do productive things. I didn't see any of those twists coming. I know I probably should have. But I didn't. And while some may say the plot was too convenient, or too basic, or too convoluted--I was never bored. Not once. Do you have any idea how long it's been since I've been this invested in a novel? Too long, my friends.There is just one thing I would have liked to see more of inThe Cruel Prince,and that's worldbuilding. I still have no idea what a Seelie Court and an Unseelie Court are, and I suppose I could look it up, but I would have preferred an explanation in the book. Maybe I'll get one inThe Wicked King.Even though the atmosphere in Elfhame was just perfect, I wanted to know more about the world outside that of the faerie, and how it all connected to the human world. But that's not enough to take off more than a star, because Cardan and Jude have stolen my heart, and I'm pressing charges.Buddy read withmy fellow Jude stan.

useless.hah, i bet you thought she was something elsebut no, i hate to be the bearer of bad newsbut that’s all she’s made up of.i considered jumping inside the book multiple times just to smack some sense into her.k let’s start with how Jude loves the man who killed her parentsbut there’s a line that she doesn’t crossbecause he still killed her parentsso she can’t love him too muchbut she does love himcause he took them in and raised themand he’s like a father to herand it’s absolutely normal to lovethe man who killed both ofyour parents in front of your eyes.do you see my dilemma?already

{'rating': 5, 'content': 'some books are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.this book is all of the above. my mind simply cannot comprehend what i just read because its greatness transcends human understanding. what a blessed world we live in where this kind of greatness exists for us mere mortals.i cant even fathom what sort of perfection‘the wicked king’will be. the last half of this book is one of the best build-ups to a sequel i have ever read. like, are you kidding me!? holly black is not of this world and this book is proof. very much looking forward to the further greatness of this series!↠4.5 stars'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '...I have no idea how this review got deleted, but here is a reupload from my blog!If I cannot be better than them, I will be so much worse.God, this book killed me.The Cruel Princehas just about what you’d expect from Black: court intrigue, an atmosphere of terror, vaguely dark romance, and a main character who is a terrible person, but is also so interesting. Plus some interesting dynamics and setup for an even better sequel. Needless to say, I found it delightful.I think Black’s tendency is to start a story with a badass opening, then spend 200 pages on slow buildup. At first I thought it was just because this is a series beginner, but the more I think about it, the more I realize her stories never have a typical growth and climax. Instead, she slowly escalates tension until suddenly the situation is horrible and you’re left wondering how these characters even got there. It’s an odd style, and one that will be divisive among readers, but it works for me.The plot here is just as slow-burning as usual, perhaps even more so. I personally thought it suited the story quite well. Even when I was slumping, this book was easy to come back to and enjoy. I have to admit, at spots the court intrigue got confusing. Main characters were easy to remember, but I couldn’t tell most of the Elder King’s children apart.Maybe my favorite part of this book was the character work. Holly Black is very talented at getting side characters to read real, even without much focus on them. But the real strength of this book is Jude’s flawed, morally grey character. I fucking loved her. She’s not the greatest person, but she’s so incredibly aware of it that I found it hard not to love her.I also wanted to spare a paragraph for the romance. There is a sort-of romance in the first half, and it is honestly the weakest part of the first three-quarters. (See my updates for this book.)Thankfully, this thrown-in and tensionless romance is improved upon further into the book. I’m not going to spoil it, exactly, but we all know Black loves her Hades/Persephone-esque dynamics. The dynamic between the two characters who I think will get together really turned me off in the first half; I was looking out for some kind of lacking-in-consent bad-boys-are-hawt type thing. That’s not what you’ll find here. This is much more of a genuine Hades/Persephone dynamic than a bad-boys-are-hot romance. I’ve written about the difference before on my blog, but this is one of the better handlings of it I’ve seen. There was one scene in this book between them that… well, I think my brain just screamed “holy shit” for a minute straight. One of those scenes I’m going to bookmark and reread over and over again.Anyway, I definitely loved this. When is book two coming out again?Brief note before I finish this review, and this doesn’t need much commentary: Ben and Severin had a cameo in this. I almost cried, embarrassingly enough. The Darkest Part of the Forest is one of my favorite books ever. According to a couple other reviews, some of the side characters are also cameos from her first fae series, if you’re at all interested! I didn’t notice because I’ve never read it.

No, scratch that, I didn’t have expectations, I never do, never dare hope—I usually try to not expect much of a book so I wouldn't be disappointed—what I had was simply assumptions about how it was gonna be. And I was completely and utterly wrong.People make this seem like a romance-oriented book; it is not.This book is less about the romance (which only starts to show itself a little by the end) and more about games, intrigue and, most importantly, the characters. It’s about anger. Betrayal. Revenge. Secrets and, above all, power. This is the dangerous tale of a human girl who grew up in faerieland and has endured much cruelty and pain, is bullied at school, because of being mortal and weak.She will show you she is not.Let no one call Jude Duarteweak.That’s what comes of hungering for something: You forget to check if it’s rotten before you gobble it down.She will be the human who looks at all that faeries have, acknowledges that she, as a human, is unworthy of those things, still wants them anyways, and thus takes them. Faeries might always be better than her, but she can be much, much worse. It should not surprise you that I adore her, then.The Cruel Princeis a cruel, enchanting tale of a cruel, enchanting people in a cruel, enchanting world. And all that I said are the reasons why I will love it forever. With you, to the ends of time.As always, you can check out my chosen soundtrack for the series at the end of the review—I went slightly wild there and made a mash up of the three books’ covers to create one for my playlist.The odd thing about ambition is this: You can acquire it like a fever, but it is not so easy to shed.CW➾ abuse, bullying, drugging, speciesism (faeries over humans rather than humans over animals), self harm✧ Storyline ✧One ordinary night a not so ordinary man drops from the sky into an ordinary human neighborhood riding a not so ordinary horse. He dismounts and walks up to one of the many ordinary houses and, raising his not so ordinary fist, he knocks.The night is no longer ordinary.For inside the house, three little girls watch TV and eat fish sticks with ketchup. For one bears half-faerie blood, while the pair of full human twins do not. For an scared woman comes running from the kitchen and the man calls her wife and traitor. For he kills her and takes the three little girls to faerieland. For in Faerie, there are no fish sticks, no ketchup, and no television.“Because you’re like a story that hasn’t happened yet. Because I want to see what you will do. I want to be part of the unfolding of the tale.”What there is in Fearie is a court ruled by the High King, presiding over the three factions of the Seelie Court, the Unseelie court, and the wild fey. And that king has a general—a faerie whose wife left him pregnant with his heir, a faerie who slaughtered a family one not so ordinary night and took three human girls.Jude is the youngest of the three, the younger twin, and she wants nothing more than to belong, craves nothing more than being knighted and a permanent part of the court. Even if most of the faeries hate humans; even if she is bullied at school by the youngest prince and his gang; even if she is belittled and bloodied and nearly killed.So it should come as a surprise to no one that she would lie and spy and become a vengeful murderess who changes the game. It does anyways.“I am tired of caring,” I say. “Why should I?”“Because they could kill you!”“They better,” I say to her. “Because anything less than that isn’t going to work.”✧ Storytelling ✧Shame on you, Mary, for waiting so long to pick up a masterpiece ofHolly Black’s.A tale so well told. A twisted fairytale so mesmerising. An atmosphere so immersive and pulsing. An eye for detail and consideration and clever themes and additions. A hand wielding words and metaphors as a master swordsman would a sword.I read my first Black book and did not look back.“I’ve seen many impossible things. I have seen the acorn before the oak. I have seen the spark before the flame. But never have I seen such as this: A dead woman living. A child born from nothing.”✧ Characters ✧★Jude:Call her a wrecking ball if you want, call her an annoying bitch if you dare, I would only say you don’t comprehend the joy of jumping into the canyon of anger, the peace in throwing rules and caution into the wind, the freedom in crossing the line and embracing the glorious beauty of revenge. “It’s the thrill of leaping without being able to see the ground below you, right before you realize that’s called falling.” I would say that you’ve never known the colours. I would say you are blind.She is a prideful, unyielding fighter who hates being vulnerable, being controlled. She is a vengeful, violent liar who adores power, adores attention.She is angry and dark and probably needs to see a therapist but, if you told her so, would most likely tell you to go eff yo self and that she can manage herself quite nicely thank you very much.And if you think she’s starting to sound like me...then whatever do you mean *smiles sweetly*“If you hurt me, I wouldn’t cry. I would hurt you back.”I’d heardcriticism of Jude’s reaction to the trauma of her childhoodand agreed with it for the beginning chapters, but then I realised that it’s merely that she handles the trauma differently.What Jude does is escape thinking about what happened, flee her feelings and fear; and it naturally results in her becoming out of touch with her emotions. She endures and pushes it into the back of her brain due to not knowing another way to cope and that’s the way that comes naturally to her. She is always afraid, always on alert, so she’s grown numb and used to it, so she’s turned tired and angry, so she lashes out.In fact, her mental state is captured accurately, because our personality shapes our response to trauma the same way trauma shapes our personality.She doesn’t have nightmares not because her trauma has been ignored, but because she can’t calm her nerves enough to even sleep.Before, I never knew how far I would go. Now I believe I have the answer. I will go as far as there is to go. I will go way too far.And if you put that kind of personality under pressure, it acts much like an elastic object: springing upon release, going wild and hitting everything at close range. She was raised in a house of butchery by a man who delights in war and death and conflict. And because such a man was her father and such a man killed her father, this is the birth of a murderer. Her composed smiles coming unraveled, coming undone.“I thought I was supposed to be good and follow the rules. But I am done with being weak. I am done with being good. I think I am going to be something else.”★Cardan:A few months ago a friend of mine forced me to watch the kdramaBoys Over Flowersin exchange for me asking her to watch the BBCSherlock; the deal was that we’d each watch 6 episodes of our respective shows and stop after that if we’re no longer interested. I, ofc, stopped after 6 because I just can’t connect with kdaramas. But I’m glad I watched those episodes, because I can now write this:Cardan Greenbriar is literally and thoroughly Gu Jun-pyo fromBoys Over Flowers.But where I only found Jun-pyo entertaining, IloveCardan, probably because of Jude’s difference from the female lead of the show. With Jun-pyo it was just a petulant boyo lashing out and being angry and bullying and abusing a powerless girl (who still got back at him impressively but still, their personalities where the opposites) while with Cardanit’s a sparring match.I called him “a simple old-school bully” the very first time we were introduced, and I was both right and wrong. Right because he is an old-school bully, yet wrong because he is not simply so but playfully; Cardan is a clever cruel prince, an angry spoiled/abused child, and a charming adorable coward. Too young, too weak, too mean, too precious! But not ambitious, not like Jude.I blame you guys for being disappointed at first; it was unfair to feel annoyed that he couldn’t fill the shoes I’d thought Holly Black was intending for him when shewasn’tintending those shoes for him. He has his own shiny shoes to stand in and THANK GOD.“There’s safety in being awful.”✯Locke:First character who intrigued me with his bored, manipulative ways. I spent a long time just repeatingwhat’s his game what’s his gamein my notes, I swear, and I find it rather perfect that his game is just that—a game. This drama-loving fox is one I simultaneously want to kiss and kill and absolutely cannot get enough of.✯Taryn:Jude’s twin sister is much like her while still being the opposite. She, too, wants to belong and would do anything to achieve it; she, too, can be cold and manipulative as the faeries and craves their exotic danger, growing used to recognising bad things as good; and she, too, has had to become something else to survive, something not so human. But where Jude is wildfire, she is ice; one is raging, the other composed. Both burn you in the end.“Desire is an odd thing. As soon as it’s sated, it transmutes. If we receive golden thread, we desire the golden needle.”☆ Those aren’t the only ones that made an impact:Madocwith his anger issues and twisted love,Viviwith her raging selfish heart that encourages the same trait in others,Orianawho is way more than she seems. All layered, none all-evil, being a mix of cruel and gentle. I heard someone say this book has an all-Slytherin cast, and I’m inclined to agree—no wonder I enjoy them all so much.✧ Relationships ✧“Like taking a dare to run over knives, like an adrenaline strike of lightning, like the moment when you’ve swum too far out in the sea and there is no going back, only cold black water closing over your head.❥Romance:Can I just say Chapter 25 & 26? BECAUSE CHAPTER 25 & 26! To be frank with you, I wasn’t sure at first about these two as I had my doubts regarding Cardan being someone who could possibly match Jude in strength, but I now adore them because I realised the nature of dynamic is a game wheresheis the one with the power (while being terrified of him ever having any power) and he is drawn to that. He likes to challenge her, question her,tryto best her, while actually delighting in her holding a dagger at his throat.They spar; they fight; they have (more or less) the same personality, liars and deceivers and and power-oriented people.Their only difference is that he’s a pleasure-seeking coward where she’s a purposeful warrior, and that somehow makes them an even better match.“He’s flint, you’re tinder.”❥Familial Bonds:I’ve already talked too much so I’ll just say that the sisterhood, brother-sister bond, father-daughter relationship...all are written tangibly, conveying the complicated and contradictory feelings that come with being a family (and one so messed up as this) quite perfectly. It was a gem to read.✧ Worldbuilding ✧Faerie might be beautiful, but its beauty is like a golden stag’s carcass, crawling with maggots beneath his hide, ready to burst.This land of beautiful nightmares, these creatures of twilight and glamours, these clawed hands bearing nevermore and faerie fruit with their superstitious-like practices (e.g. having a necklace of dried rowan berries or wearing your stockings inside out) that are not simply superstitions, all serve to exceptionally bring this world into life and prove that world building is, indeed, Holly Black’s ultimate strength.In the end, readingThe Cruel Princewith its mythical magic and all the cruelties, deceptions, and (hypocritical) prejudice of its people, feels like wandering through a fairytale that chose the path on its left somewhere down the road, refusing to go right. And you bet I always choose the path on my left as well.✧ Companions ✧Book series playlist:Spotify URLBooks in series:➳ The Cruel Prince (The Folk of the Air, #1) ★★★★★➳The Lost Sisters(The Folk of the Air, #1.5) ★★★★☆➳The Wicked King(The Folk of the Air, #2) ★★★★★➳The Queen of Nothing(The Folk of the Air, #3) ★★★★☆➳How the King of Elfhame Learned to Hate Stories(The Folk of the Air, #3.5) ☆☆☆☆☆""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I know you missed my star auctions… Here comes the new one! Let’s start with five billion! Did I hear five centillion! Are you out of your mind? I don’t think there are centillion stars on the universe! Well, red head lady slaps the bidder and gave this book FIVE CENTILLION STARS anyways! SOLD with an all exclusive trip to fae world ( limitless Chardonnay and tequila shots included)Awwwwwwww I’m in love with this book! This is definitely a Tarantino story taken place at the Fae World and we have hero and heroine (half human half villanelle) who are cheater, liar, playing dirty and unfair and they’re match made in heaven. Normally I want to punch the people with those attributes but I’m drawn to them! I officially let them under my skin and now I’m singing “Hey Jude, don’t make it bad, take a sad song and make it better”This book is dark, entertaining, captivating and addictive. We have blood freezing, heart throbbing parts like GOT’s Red Wedding. But the worst part is it finishes so fast now my hands are shaking, legs are tapping, eyes are getting watery, I want it more and I have only one book left! I know the second one is even better. And as soon as I finish it, I’ll suffer from worse addiction withdrawals! There are 49 days for third book’s release ( shit October is 31 days so it is 50 days!!!! NOOOOOO!!!)As a precaution my husband hid my kindle to prevent me starting the second book and locked me in our wine cellar (Ok, kidding, we’re not rich! He locked me at my bedroom with one case of Chardonnay, enough food for feeding an army -equal to my one course meal!-) but he forgot I had my spare key. Anyways, I stopped ironing his clothes and dishwashing as a punishment (Well, actually I never do them but don’t bother! I’m 2000’s Peggy Bundy with no children and better hairstyle!)So the things made me falling in love and craving 200 sequel books of this series are:-AMAZING CHARACTERIZATIONS:Two misfit, outsider, black sheep of the families, did I tell you how much I love those wicked hero and ruthless heroine? : Jude and Cardan are my new Mickey and Mallory, Joker and Harley Quinn, Honey Bunny and Pumpkin.Jude witnessed to her parents’ murder when she was a little girl and has been whisked away to live in Faerie world where she is neglected, bullied and unwanted from the others.And Cardan is youngest son of High King, tormented by his own brothers and grow up in a world of wildness, cruelness, savageness. He hasn’t been loved, pampered and only way to survive is acting like he didn’t care anything about power games and politics, staying drunk and making vicious and wicked circle of friends: Nicasia: power thirsty, Locke: drama king, Valerian: violence lover.Less lovable and bringers of my slap urge: Locke and Taryn ( no spoilers but they are spineless human beings! Correction: woman being and faerie being)-CLIFFHANGER: I was expecting something surprising will come out and my spider senses didn’t surprise me (I climb to the walls to celebrate it)-FAST PACING, BLOODY ACTION PARTS, MANIPULATIONS, MIND AND POWER GAMES: I wish Holly Black took the seat of the last season of GOT and gave the bloody, violent and satisfying ending we deserved. At least she didn’t write something about a raven king, right?-LOVE STORY: Those characters are in love with power and they don’t know what it means to love somebody but they’re hopelessly drawn each other. This is Shakespearean kind of tragic story and I can feel it doesn’t have a proper HEA! But this obsessive, uncontrollable attraction of dark hero and heroine put a big, widen Joker smile on my face. It’s hot as hell!So 50 days to 3rd book and I’ll wait at least two weeks for the second book. ( It’s Catch 22 because reading and waiting are equally painful! I wish I could be patient enough till all the books release and I can devour them one by one) As a summary: My vote for Best Fantasy this year is obvious! This is also gotten its place at my all-time favorite books list!'}]"

Tender Is the Flesh
",Agustina Bazterrica,3.78,267931,1464,"Horror, Fiction, Dystopia, Science Fiction, Thriller, Audiobook, Adult",209,29-11-2017,"Working at the local processing plant, Marcos is in the business of slaughtering humans—though no one calls them that anymore.His wife has left him, his father is sinking into dementia, and Marcos tries not to think too hard about how he makes a living. After all, it happened so quickly. First, it was reported that an infectious virus has made all animal meat poisonous to humans. Then governments initiated the “Transition.” Now, eating human meat—“special meat”—is legal. Marcos tries to stick to numbers, consignments, processing.Then one day he’s given a a live specimen of the finest quality. Though he’s aware that any form of personal contact is forbidden on pain of death, little by little he starts to treat her like a human being. And soon, he becomes tortured by what has been lost—and what might still be saved.","[{'rating': 1, 'content': 'Many might say that a book dealing with the level of brutality and horrific subject matter that makes up this book could never be thoughtful or highbrow. I disagree with that. I definitely think literature depicting graphic violence doesn\'t automatically disqualify it from being anything more than an assault on the senses or torture porn. I think it can lay out valuable examinations of so many aspects of society that deserve to be scrutinized, all while remaining allegorical. Battle Royale by Koushun Takami (as well as its film adaptation) is just one example of a successful novel of this nature.Unfortunately, Tender Is The Flesh didn\'t live up to that expectation for me.It trulyisbrimming with brutality. In fact, that\'s all it is, is brutal. A virus that turns animal meat poisonous to humans causes humans to slaughter every non-human animal and begin factory farming human beings for food instead. You would think that a concept such as:""imagine what the world would be like if humans were treated the way we treat animals in factory farms""would have a lot to say. Just think about the fact that in the western part of the world, most people don\'t think twice about eating certain animals as food, but will get disgusted, enraged and even downright racist when other cultures in other parts of the world eat animals westerners don\'t view as \'food animals\'. Or the fact that most people eat fish, have no qualms with the concept of fishing, but will protest whale hunting as it applies to various Indigenous cultures, particularly Inuit. I could go on and on. The point is, a book with this concept could tackle some serious societal issues - environmental destruction, racism, health, food insecurity, speciesism, etc. As I entered this book and continued reading through it, I often wondered, ""are we going to examine which humans are deemed \'food humans\' in a meaningful way? Does it even matter? Does race, class, sexuality, oranythingcome into play in this near-future dystopian world that so closely could resemble our own?""And the answer is no. Because this book unpacksnothing.There were certainly minor suggestions toward some things, but they were quickly set aside in order to either continue describing the horrific acts inflicted upon these farmed humans, or to meander on about mundane things in the main character\'s personal life that ended up having little to no significance on the overall story. We didn\'t even really get anything in the way of showing how people came to accept this cannibalistic way of life, or how those who work in these factories are affected in their personal lives. The closest we get to a glimpse of this is the main character essentially being described as not caring one way or another, human or non-human slaughter, because he was only in the industry in order to pay for his father\'s nursing home. I\'m sorry, but that is just not well-rounded enough for me as a reader. There was even the compelling hint at an ongoing conspiracy theory that the virus was faked by governments in order to deceive society into cannibalism as a means to alleviate overpopulation. However, this subplot peters out pretty quickly, but onlyafterhaving a group of teenage boys briefly bring up the conspiracy\'s existence in conversation while graphically killing a litter of puppies they found in an abandoned zoo. Again, it\'s brutality for the sake of brutality and seemingly nothing else.Of course, I don\'t need -and I know many other readers don\'t need- literature or any form of entertainment to have a big, glaring moral spoonfed to me/us. Despite all that I\'ve said, I hope it doesn\'t seem like I\'m implying I didn\'t like this book because it didn\'t hold my hand while leading me through a clear and precise commentary of my own biases. I don\'t need that. But if a book is to be this grotesque in its depictions, I do think it should either go completely nihilistic (and thus letthatspeak for itself) or have at least something compelling to show for it. I think, overall, this book felt incomplete to me andthat\'smy biggest gripe. The author certainly had ideas, but because her world-building was weak and her writing offered little in the way of depth, those ideas never really broke the surface and ended up fizzling out before anything of interest or import could come of it.Underneath all its gruesomeness, shock value and gore, it\'s actually a super boring book.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'I have always believed that in our capitalist, consumerist society, we devour each other.- Agustina BazterricaThis story is really disturbing, and it isn\'t until the very last page that it becomes clear just how deeply disturbing it is.Tender Is the Fleshis an Argentinian import from an author who is apparently very popular in her own country. After reading this, dare I ask what other horrors she has created? This dystopian horror story is set in a world that feels so close to our own, except a zoonotic virus has made it so that all animals have had to be destroyed. To fill the gap in the meat market, people start to breed and farm humans for their meat.It is as horrifying and gory as it sounds. Extra warning for those sensitive to scenes of sexual assault and animal cruelty. But while it is hard to stomach at times, I was morbidly fascinated by what Bazterrica had to say about the way humans take advantage of other humans because they can get away with it. The book is horribly convincing and believable. We only have to look to our own real world to recall the excuses humans have made to enslave other humans and to shuttle them off to extermination camps. It does not take a huge suspension of disbelief to imagine the events of this book could happen.The book also focuses on the way language is used to make humans feel better about committing atrocities. No one is allowed to say ""cannibalism"" and the meat in the book is packaged as ""special meat"". There\'s some dark humour, too, with a few prods at the hypocrisy of humans being outraged by slavery at the same time as imprisoning and eating other humans.It is told in third person limited and follows Marcos Tejo who works at a meat plant. He takes us through all the horrors involved with breeding, killing, flaying and packaging humans, whilst also dealing with the loss of his own infant son.For such a bleak tale, it is surprisingly compelling. All the time while reading I was wondering what on earth the conclusion of this nightmare could leave us with, but I think it was even more effective than I could have imagined.'}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""One of the most relentless and ugly books I've ever read. A book that describes a society where humans are slaughtered for meat, in more detail than I was ready for. This novel willfully refuses to allow itself to fall into any category of fiction that would make it easier to take as a reader. The flat direct style of its prose didn't allow me, as I read along, to think of it as horror, or satire, or a metaphorical representation of social injustice, or a nihilistic moral thesis about humanity. It is exactly what it is. Never boring, it managed to continue to shock me until its final pages.In 2010 Roger Ebertreviewed the cult movieThe Human Centipedeand wrote:I am required to award stars to movies I review. This time, I refuse to do it. The star rating system is unsuited to this film. Is the movie good? Is it bad? Does it matter?

Left with no meat source to cultivate, humanity has turned to cannibalism to whet its appetite, satiate its ceaseless hunger for flesh and blood. Humans are now domesticated, mass produced, slaughtered, and sold for ""special meat."" Pickled fingers, barbecued ribs, broiled tongue served over kimchi and potato salad, taste humanity dressed in herbs and spices.Marcos is from the past generation. He was among those who witnessed the animals decimated and humanity slowly regress back to its primeval instincts choosing to savagely devour their kin than be without meat. Practically raised in an animal slaughterhouse his father owned, Marcos found his expertise needed in this new industry asking for mass murder. Thus Marcos swallowed the bitter reality in front of him and did what he needed to survive until fate brought him despair to awaken his dulled senses, and then beauty to remind him of his humanity.The concept of cannibalism is nothing new to us. Civilizations of the past from the mighty Aztecs of Mexico, to the great tribes of the Pacific Islands and Southeast Asia, and even the great Pharaohs of Egypt have displayed behaviour involving the use of human meat as food source. The concept of human beings being sold and treated as commercial goods we have seen and eradicated as well in the form of slavery. But the combination of cannibalism, mass production of humans, and commercialization of human meat - an entire industry devoted to making cannibalism efficient and profitable - is a hard idea to grasp.As you read through the book\'s pages the inital shock factor wears off and you are left with a curious feeling of resignation. Gradually you realize that your mind has accepted this behavior and what used to induce revulsion has now affected a normalcy. The infinite capacity of human beings to adapt is a powerful phenomenon, and to an extent our ability to survive is infinitely pronounced by the alternative darkness presented here. But at the same time our tendency to set aside our morals, our code of ethics, at the smallest sign of discomfort is in perfect display as well. If this book has an idea as its driving force, it is that we need to accept that we are nothing but beasts. Man is an animal. We are capable of feral acts, and the unconscious desire to erase all we have learned through civilization and revert into savageness is ever present. This is why our society will never be perfect. Because while most educate themselves out of their beastly instincts. Others cannot let go of their aggression, cannot deny their barbaric urge for violence, and suppress their predatory thirst for blood. In just an instant the overcoat of civility can be dropped to reveal an untamed animal: brute, wild, murderous, ready to eat its own kind. This we cannot let happen.Sink your teeth into this gritty and often jarring piece of literature. It can be therapeutic - a small taste of the gory to quench the monstrous urge within. Better encountered in literature than manifested through actual violence. Indulge in this mortal feast. Behind its depictions of human slaughter and cannibalism you\'ll find yourself intoxicated by its morbid truths.

Excessive. Polemical. Gruesome.In 1729, Jonathan Swift published a sustained Juvenalian satire calledA Modest Proposalin which he solved in one move the economic and social woes of the starving poor, especially in Ireland: all they had to do was sell their children to be eaten by the rich, and not just would they become wealthy, but the population over-crowding would be eased as well. One line that has always stayed with me is this: 'A young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee, or a ragout.' It's a line that might well serve as a fitting epigraph for this book.Bazterrica offers to us a world in which cannibalism rules, now called the Transition and covered over by linguistic euphemisms to make it, er, palatable. The thing is this isn't really a dystopia as I've seen it described: it reflects all kinds of realities, albeit pushed to extremes. The conveyor line killing sounds like the process that animals go through, stunned, slaughtered, turned into leather, fertilizer, as well as prime cuts of meat. The mass transits that bring 'heads' to the killing centres remind us of the Nazi death-trains, complete with the occasional 'head' trying desperately to escape before being shot. The laboratory doing medical experiments on live specimens reflect our own pharmaceutical and medical protocols. The Scavengers are the have-nots, socially ostracised and kept outside of social structures like the homeless on our streets. And the 'game-hunting' and people-trafficking are just a step away from what we read about every day. Bazterrica's vision may be excessive, and shockingly so, but only just: and the book asks provocative, uneasy questions about what exactly it is which separates the human from animal.This is no1984orThe Handmaid's Tale: it doesn't have the extensive, convincing world-building and is shorter, more polemical - but for a short read-it-in-a-few-hours book it's punchy and oh so provocative.

Latin American lit is so often crushed into the mold of magic realism that, like a black hole, publishing sucks up all the works that do not ascribe to that category and condemns them to darkness. But Tender is the Flesh is definitely science fiction. It would sit prettily (or disturbingly) next to The Road or Under the Skin. It has that quality of a literary, high-quality dystopia that academics like to feast on. It's also entirely engrossing.The plot is basic. In a near-future (or alternate reality?) dystopia, cannibalism is a common occurrence. People are bred for meat consumption and graves are ransacked for tasty cadavers. A man who works in a meat processing facility suddenly finds himself with a costly luxury gift: a human who should be consumed for her meat. Cue moral dilemmas and ruminations.White audiences often demand 'authentic' Latin American novels. By which I mean they want a word italicized every paragraph and enough 'local color' to render a text into the equivalent of a cheap, plastic Frida Kahlo statuette. Tender is the Flesh obviously does not evoke any of those plastic concerns. It's bold, nasty and entirely it's own thing while also reflecting an era that I like to call New Latin American and Hispanic Fantastic, which has little to nothing to do with magic realism (see Michelle Roche Rodríguez and others).It's a very interesting book and one that any science fiction fan should pursue with the obvious warning that it's pretty dark material.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'reading vlog:https://youtu.be/AXpfik6Q72gThe love I have for this book has me looking at myself in a whole new light.THIS is my horror.

No rain.” ( it rained buckets). Or many younger folk might have had the experience of being tucked in bed while saying their prayers at their parents’ direction: “�� and God bless Mummy and Daddy and please help cure Grandma’s liver cancer.” (She died the next week). And we all know about the standard line by the hero in Westerns and B-movie Adventures: “Don’t worry Ma’am, it’ll be all right, I promise.” (of course it never is).There is a deep impulse to believe that our words can change the world. Hence our fascination with incantations, magical spells, arcane knowledge, religious ritual, and obdurate idealism. Of course words don’t change the world. But they sure do change the users of words. We pretend to have some control over the world by speaking about it with confidence and decisiveness. Actually we’re whistling in the dark. It’s an evolutionary compensation I suppose. Consciousness of our own mortality and its constant fear would be detrimental to our survival. So we have words to protect us. We explain things. We rationalise our fragile and insignificant existence as something of cosmic and eternal importance.Words allow us to rationalise, to normalise, absolutely any set of circumstances if we think it’s in our interests to do so. We call this morality, when all that term means is that we have found the words to make us feel safer, more secure, less bestial, in short, that we are able to live with each other without constant fear. Words allow this. Our actions may be abysmally horrid, intensely, anti-social, entirely self-serving even self-destructive, but we’re comfortable with that as long as the words justify, or at least don’t forbid, what we do.Tender Is the Fleshtakes our rationalising talent very seriously. I feel confident to say that it goes beyond the bounds of any other literary or cinematic experience any of us has ever had. The book makes Orwell’s1982look like a fairy story. The infamous filmThe Texas Chain Saw Massacredoesn’t touch it for horror.Soylent Greenbecomes a euphemistic appetiser. Documentaries of the Holocaust come closest I suppose, but even they don’t depict the systematic breeding of victims, their mutilation to prevent self-abortion, the casual mass slaughter, butchering, distribution, and sale of the resulting cuts of meat to the social elite.Yes, the book is about industrialised cannibalism. It is meant to shock. It clearly intends to show how we use language to do whatever we think necessary to live comfortably. Victims are not human; they are product. Their hands are front trotters; ears and fingers are mixed brochettes; and there’s tongue à la vinaigrette as a delicacy. The most expensive cuts deserve time and care in preparation:“It’s the most tender kind of meat, there’s only just a little, because a kid doesn’t weigh as much as a calf… It melts in your mouth.”This is a world created by words. Or rather it is a world in which words have progressively transformed the people who use them. Words have allowed them to enter a new reality and“to reaffirm this reality through words, as though words created and maintain the world in which they live.”It is true that“words construct a small, controlled world that’s full of cracks. A world that could fracture with one inappropriate word.”So certain words referring to victims as human, for example, are punished severely. But some still remember when the words meant something different. Marcos, the protagonist, is one such, and the new words“are words that strike at his brain, accumulate, cause damage. He wishes he could say atrocity, inclemency, excess, sadism.”I am reminded by this book of the many ways we justify the cruelest action. One in particular strikes me as apposite, the Massacre of Béziers in the year 1209. A force of crusading knights were ordered by Pope Innocent III to root out the heresy of Catharism from the South of France. Commanded by his legate, Arnaud Amalric, the abbot of the great Benedictine monastery of Citeaux, the force laid siege to the place. When the citizenry refused to give up the small band of Cathars in the town, the abbot gave his infamous order:Caedite eos. Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius. - “Kill them all. God will know his own.”About 20,000 inhabitants were slaughtered. The abbot was rewarded with a bishopric.This was a case in which profoundly inhumane horror was not only permitted but promoted by the words, the necessity, of religious doctrine - ‘heretic’ dehumanised people as completely as ‘product.’ It could just as well be military, political, racial, or gender words. Expediency can become our morality almost instantly. There are indeed no limits to our ability to invent such words and to rationalise such behaviour. The horrors recounted in Agustina Bazterrica’s novel are themselves justified by this sad fact. It says what no one says often enough.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '“Tender Is the Flesh” by Agustina Bazterrica is definitely one of those kinds of horror novels that will stay with you for a very long time. It’s a very unique, crazy, and freaky dystopian-inspired novel that guarantees you will never look at meat the same ever again.Oh yes, this novel deals with what would happen if all the animals on Earth had a virus and we all had to resort to eating human meat to survive. Needless to say, I’d highly recommend you do not eat or drink anything while reading during certain chapters because it’ll definitely gross you out beyond belief.I enjoyed Bazterrica’s unique style of writing as I know this was translated from Spanish to English and thought it was pretty good all around. It has its creepy moments with very disturbing and graphic scenes that pretty much add a very eerie element to what the world would be like if this ever happened. Don’t worry, I won’t ruin anything for you but before I discuss more of my thoughts about this novel, I have another huge heads-up for everyone since I am a proud pet owner.If you get triggered by violence against animals, please note there is a graphic scene here involving pets that is very messed up. If you prefer not to read anything that does have violence against animals, definitely stay away from this one. It didn’t bother me because I know it’s not real but I know how this can bother my fellow readers so I just wanted to make that clear.At any rate, the only thing I’d say that I didn’t like about “Tender Is the Flesh” is that some parts dragged on. Some chapters also felt fragmented and out of place so it took some getting used to this style of writing. It’s not terrible, but it does start out a bit confusing, picks up well, then goes back to dragging on a bit. Once I hit the 60% mark, it starts to get really good so it was definitely worth the wait.When it comes to the ending, I was hoping for something a bit different but it definitely came out of nowhere. It was definitely shocking and something I didn’t see coming at all so kudos to Bazterrica for hitting me with something unexpected. I thought it ended well and wow, what a way to just drop the mic!Overall, I give “Tender Is the Flesh” by Agustina Bazterrica a 4/5 as it’s really the shock value of human meat that makes this a solid read. It’s so graphic and disturbing that it’s pretty much the essence of why this novel is as popular as it is. The storyline and characters were alright but these didn’t really do it for as much as the incredibly creepy writing about processing, slaughtering, and yes, eating human meat. That’s the selling point to this as it exceeded my wildest expectations in that regard and I enjoyed that horror aspect of it immensely.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Title: TENDER IS THE FLESHAuthor: Agustina Bazterrica, Sarah Moses (Translator)Publisher: Simon & SchusterA virus sweeps across our globe rendering all animals toxic to humans. They have to be eliminated. All of them. Animals in captivity, wild animals, our beloved pets. Eventually, the human race looks to alternative sources of food.“Special meat”Human beings are raised like cattle, bred for human consumption. The main character of this dystopian horror novel is Marcos, a high-level manager for a meat processing plant. Due to a personal tragedy, he and his wife are separated. Marcos is struggling with the weight of grief and loss as well as the violent nature of his job.I have never been so engrossed in a book. The thought-provoking, shocking subject matter combined with the disturbing chain of events happening in the protagonist’s life makes for a captivating reading experience. Bazterrica’s prose cuts with the precision of a scalpel; every sentence penetrating. Glimpses of humanity shine through the dark brutality and violence of a cannibalistic society but are quickly overshadowed by some act of depravity. At times, the intensity is so extreme, that it’s tempting to lay the book aside or skim through a disturbing scene but again, Bazterrica’s storytelling is so magnetic, that it’s impossible to let go of one’s curiosity. The need to see this through to the end is necessary and rewarding. One of the most insane endings I’ve ever read.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Instagram||Twitter||Facebook||Amazon||PinterestTENDER IS THE FLESH has been on my radar for a while but I was a little worried about picking it up because it sounded intense and, as I have said in previous reviews, I am a soft and jellied wimp when it comes to horror. And this is no gentle, easy read: it\'s a dystopian work translated from Spanish (by way of Argentina) about a futuristic world in which a plague has rendered animals poisonous to humans, so humans are being born and bred for the consumption of other humans, either literally (as meat) or consumeristically (for sport, ""leather,"" or extremely niche and sadistic forms of fetish sex).***WARNING: this review will have spoilers and will discuss extremely disturbing things that happen in this book***I am not a vegetarian but I don\'t actually eat a lot of meat, for a combination of reasons, which resolve around health (too much meat, especially processed, can lead to colon cancer and pancreatic cancer, among other health risks), ethical reasons (mass-produced meat is often taken from facilities that don\'t raise or slaughter animals humanely, and takes a huge toll on the environment), and financial (meat is expensive and alternatives are a lot cheaper (it\'s very easy to make seitan from vital wheat protein, or soak up and fry some textured vegetable protein-- and unlike 90s alternatives, it tastes great). I\'ve read FAST FOOD NATION and watched interviews with Temple Grandin (an autistic woman who is famous for how she has helped change meat processing plants for the better, to be more humane, because of her incredible ability to empathize with animals), so I already know that a lot of the times, knowing the secrets behind the food on your table can sometimes leave you thinking that ignorance is bliss. But it\'s also sticking your head in the sand, because at the end of the day, you do vote with your wallet, and I feel like people who can afford to careshouldcare about what goes on the table and in their mouths.In U.S. culture (and other cultures as well, I assume) there\'s this almost fetishistic view of meat among some people. It seems to be tied into masculinity, as if by eating meat you prove somehow either your virility, or your complete dominion over the so-called lesser beings that inhabit this world. People lob around the insult ""soy-boy,"" as if eating soy over dairy somehow makes someone less of a man, because real men eat meat. Bazterrica runs with this premise in her book, where the government has converted the way they process meat to accommodate for human flesh, and shows, by replacing with animals with humans, how utterly inhumane the meat industry is, and how we, as a society, dissociate ourselves from the process by which an animal becomes food. We even see that removal begin in the language itself: pigs become pork, baby cows become veal, sheep become mutton, etc.Marcos, our narrator, is a depressed man who works in such a facility. His father is dying with dementia and his wife has left him following the death of their baby. He hates the meat industry and he hates that they don\'t call it what it is, tiptoeing around semantics by referring to human meat as ""special meat"" or as ""head"" when they\'re alive. Infractions can result in death, with those who commit the crimes ending up as meat, as well. He still remembers a time when real animals were slaughtered, and he knows that some people are unable to come to terms with this. His father is one of those people, and we are led to believe that this is one of the reasons for his cognitive decline. When Marcos is gifted a premium-grade human woman as a gift by his employer, she\'s the last thing he wants, but he ends up raising her as a pet and then as something more, as the line between consumer and consumed becomes terrifyingly thin.This book wasn\'t as bad as I was expecting it to be-- I think because I\'ve had to participate in a biology lab and have had to be wrist-deep in organs for science. People were a little cagey on the details, so if you\'re worried about whether this book will be too much for you, I will say that it goes into pretty great detail on the slaughtering process. There\'s an entire chapter about how humans are stunned, killed, and packaged. There\'s a part about human experimentation, run by a pretty sadistic doctor that the hero compares to Menegle (who was a Nazi scientist, in case you didn\'t know). There\'s animal cruelty, where a group of teens beat a bunch of puppies to death. And then there\'s a whole bunch of minor cruelties mentioned in asides. Pregnant ""head"" get their arms and legs cut off so they can\'t damage their babies. Rock stars and celebrities can sell themselves into a hunt, where gun nuts can hunt them and then eat them. One of these freaks captures and kills a famous rock star and brags about how eating his dick will make him virile. There are brothels that let you fuck and then kill women, and one of these same freaks refers to the process of raping the fourteen-year-old he eats as ""tenderizing,"" jokingly.The ending is disturbing and infuriating because I feel like it implies that a lot of our moral outrage is hypocritical and results in non-action, or is a mask for our own sublimated desires and cognitive dissonance. Which is a sad and depressing thought, but anyone who\'s ever been on Twitter knows that sometimes people who scream the loudest (or in all caps) can be huge hypocrites. I\'ve seen people on Goodreads try to cancel authors for writing problematic queer rep, who also have J.K. Rowling books on their shelves with five-star ratings. I guess the point of dystopians is to make people uncomfortable and force people to confront incredibly jarring aspects of society, but this message is particularly chilling.As a thought experiment, I think this book works, and it\'s no more or less disturbing than some of the classic dystopian novels I was forced to read for school, like 1984, BRAVE NEW WORLD, MAKE ROOM, MAKE ROOM! (the inspiration for the movie,Soylent Green), LOGAN\'S RUN, or THE HANDMAID\'S TALE. As a cohesive world in and of itself, I have questions. It doesn\'t really tackle some of the problems with eating human meat, such as prion disease (there was a group of people in Papua New Guinea who ended up with prion disease because of ritualistic cannibalism where they consumed their dead), or insect alternatives. For example, crickets/cricket flour has as much protein as skinless chicken. Were insects also victim to this so-called plague? (Which, the book hints, might not even exist-- the government might have made up a plague just to give themselves an excuse to legalize and legitimize cannibalism as an extreme form of population control, and yet another way for the rich to consume the poor, this time figuratively).I feel like I need to read something happy now.3 to 3.5 stars'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'So bleak and horrifying!!

Having been trained by her father to be overly observant since she was a child, Paedyn poses as a Psychic in the crowded city, blending in with the Elites as best she can in order to stay alive and out of trouble. Easier said than done.When Paeydn unsuspectingly saves one of Ilyas princes, she finds herself thrown into the Purging Trials. The brutal competition exists to showcase the Elites’ powers—the very thing Paedyn lacks. If the Trials and the opponents within them don’t kill her, the prince she’s fighting feelings for certainly will if he discovers what she is—completely Ordinary.","[{'rating': 1, 'content': ""an editor! an editor! my kingdom for a f*cking editor!(no kingdoms were harmed in the making of this review)˚✩ ⋆｡˚ ✩i am what some sexist pigs would call a basic bitch. if you give me a tall, dark-haired, sarcastic, morally-grey guy in a romantasy that combines some of my favourite books and tropes -whilst still keeping some sense of originality, i'll be content.this book had all of that. (well, the tall-dark-haired-mmc-in-a-romantasy part)excluding the originality. (and the morally-grey part but i’ll get to that)lauren said powerless was“if the child of the hunger games and red queen didn't look anything like its parents.”…see, if that were true, then this review wouldn’t exist.(and i know i’m the myopic bitch of the prime meridian, but this was exactly like it’s parents, as well shatter me and the selection)in fact, i was so angry about it, that i made a whole list. and then other people helped me add more to the list, and then, i realised that this wasn’t really an unpopular opinion at all.but before i get into all the ways this book was unoriginal, i’m going to criticise everything else. and if you don’t want to read about that,then scroll away.do not throw a tantrum in the comment section because someone expressed their criticisms about a book that you enjoyed. it’s incredibly immature, and quite franklyhilariousstupid because you’re wasting your time writing a comment that i’m just going to deleteafter screenshotting it and sending it on the group chat.anyway, let’s talk about something that actually wasn’t criticised that much: the writing.for a debut novel, it wasn’t that bad. for a book hyped up to the point where it could be mistaken as the greatest literary masterpiece this generation could ever bear witness to, it was trash.it read like an unedited draft that was both half-finished and yet too long at the same time, with the typos only making it worse. every sentence was so long-winded with synonyms upon synonyms being thrown into one sentence so whilst it might sound like this deeply thought-out didactic monologue about how inflation has affected the economy to the point that shakespeare's sonnets are no longer analysed correctly, it’s really just a horny teenage boy trying to sound edgy.and serious question: have recent authors heard of show not tell? i am not an idiot incapable of coming to my own conclusions, thank you very much. i don’t need to be told about just how morally questionable princekrabskai is, when i should just be able toinferfrom what the authorimplies. except the author didn't imply anything, for fuck's sake this dude barely killed anyone.on top of that, the sheer amount of times i read “blue eyes”, “smoky eyes”, “ocean eyes” was enough to put me off reading forever. billie eilish is crying through her “aquamarine orbs” right now. and the amount of times these characters were huffing and puffing - for the love of all that is holy, use!!an!!inhaler!! someone’s lips were always twitching into a smile, or someone was snorting/ chuckling/ blinking/ eyeing something or someone, or paedyn was being called “vicious little thing” by kai - which only succeeded in me receiving fourth wing flashbacks. kai was always flicking paedyn’s nose for no given reason, and one or the other was constantly in a “throng of people”. plus, the inner monologues were also the most repetitive things i have ever read which really helped make the book incredibly long and boring, with the pacing losing to a snail in a 500m run. it’s filled with so much banter and such eye-rolling dialogue that after a certain point, you begin to wonder how on earth the mcs would cope without hearing themselves speak, as well as so many trope-centred and pointless scenes.if you don’t believe me yet, screw you and read this list of tropes:knife/dagger/arrow to the throat (every other page), enemies to lovers (not on a single page), insta lust, slow burn, who did this to you, she's so smol, forbidden romance, cleaning each other’s wounds, comforting after a nightmare, the most unnecessary love triangle (only one love interest has a pov), some stupid trials that have no history and don’t even make sense, and the street thief trope (cue the eyeroll - i’m probably an outlier on this one, but i just hate how much the street thief trope has been overused. there was no way paedyn would have survived a day on the streets with the amount of stupid shit that she pulled. did no one notice her wonderfully-amazing-most-gorgeous-beautiful-stunning-oh-so-rare-never-seen-before hair colour while she was off pickpocketing the rich? i’m very sure no one did, seeing as it wasn’t mentioned on every.other.page.)now it's time for more stupid things.. so many stupid things. so many. and i’ve actually missed a lot so if you can remember anything i’m missing please let me know <3➳ a trained soldier is dancing in the middle of a deathly arena because he likes a girl -

i was rooting for her so hard. it was refreshing to see a fmc that didn’t have magic or special powers and had to rely on her wits to stay alive. she was an incredibly written character — the overlooked girl who constantly had to fight for what she has. her strength, wit, determination and preservation was just so admirable. getting to see her development and overcome so many obstacles was so lovely to read about. she is one of the best fmcs i have read about in a while!! she is the embodiment of “don’t underestimate the underdog.” watching her prove everyone wrong was so fun to read about, she always found a way to conquer a situation and be powerful in her own way. but girly was way stronger than me. constantly pulling away from someone you want is baffling to me, especially since it’s kai like girl that man is obsessed with you!!➳kai:the prince of Ilya and the king’s future enforcer hunts those like paedyn and kills them, yet pae somehow convinces him she’s a mundane, an elite who has a lesser power. kai has the ability to sense and use other elites powers and though he can’t sense pae’s “psychic” ability he goes along with it. from there we get to witness their palpable chemistry and snarky banter. aaa he is everything n more, i can’t get over him. this man just has a way with words. the way i was giggling like a little girl, blushing, twirling my hair and kicking my feet every time he spoke. kai was a complex character, and his struggle for redemption was interesting to read about despite who he had become. but he was just so sweet, charming, tortured, swoony, witty and perfect. when he braided her hair and called her “my pretty pae” I COMPLETELY LOST IT. I NEED HIM BIBLICALLY. the way he was so down bad for pae?? he was smitten with her from the very beginning — for him, she is the only girl in the room. the fact that he knew her capabilities and gave ‘that’s my girl’ vibes rather than forcing her into protection and hiding her away from the world. seriously, how can you not love him!!— what was the authors fascination with the characters fkn eye colour. like seriously take a shot every time you read “ocean eyes” and “grey eyes” (spoiler you will probably die from alcohol poisoning) like pls stfu about his grey eyes and her ocean eyes, i got it the first 10 times you said it and also pae constantly going on about kitt’s green eyes omg pls free me, enough is enough!! 😭➷ the slow burn is absolutely top tier, it worked so perfectly for the setting and the plot. how the author built up this fiery and heated chemistry between the mcs despite them not even sharing a single kiss was just so immaculate 😮\u200d💨 the banter and the tension was incredible, i just love the combination of a “who did this to you” boy meets “i will stab you” / “why do you care” girl. the banter and tension was good but their sweet and vulnerable moments together were even better. seriously the romance is just incredible, the way both characters navigate their own storyline but are so heavily intertwined at the same time, it was all consuming in the best possible way. the tension, knife to throat scenes, the longing stares, the lingering touches, the dance scenes, the yearning, the banter & flirty conversations is etched into my memory!!”mark my words, prince, i will be your undoing.” i lean in, ignoring the knife against my throat as i murmur, “oh, darling, i look forward to it.”— this book is marketed as “enemies to lovers” but it’s definitely more of an instant attraction as they were both captivated with one another from the very beginning. kitt (kai’s brother) and pae would be a true enemies to lovers since she didn’t like him bc of who he constantly reminded her of.— the world-building wasn’t the best and very much lacking as there wasn’t much description and depth and there was many repetitive phrases throughout this book but as this was a debut novel i’m not going to make any judgements on that as i didn’t mind and i didn’t expect this book to be perfect.this book was very fast paced which i appreciated since a lot of fantasy books tend to be slow at times. the world is easy to understand so this book is great for those who are new to fantasy books. the beginning was rocky for me but once i was into it i was really into it - you do get easily engaged and immersed, mainly because the romance is worth it. i felt so much devastation as i was reading the last few chapters. there was so much action, so much emotion and so many reveals. the author done an amazing job setting up book two because there is still so much left unsaid — I SERIOUSLY NEED THAT BOOK RN!!'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4 stars\'Who did this to you\'BOY\'why do you care\'GIRL.This book is literally a romcom with action scenes in it! It was not screaming FANTASY much, but I still enjoyed it a lot!

What else do you want??? He\'s so hot for fuck\'s sake! 😭Dark hairs, Gray eyes with loose black shirts, cocky smirk AND DIMPLES.😮\u200d💨The reason this was more rom-com type to me because he was so flirty! He was so gentle and sweet with her. He so selflessly helped her so many times without caring about himself and constantly teased and had fun with her.like letting her pin him with a dagger to the throat, silently asking permission to touch her, braiding her hair, dancing with her, doing anything to protect her life, counting her freckles, stayed awake whole night just to watch her and being affected with just her putting her finger on him! jakshsjssb 😭😭 and......

How she fought and no doubt she was pretty strong and amazing on the fighting aspect and how she was trained so perfectly. Her backstory and all didn\'t quite hit me much just like Kai\'s.❝Promise me you’ll stay alive long enough to stab me in the back?❞yes she will LITERALLY and FIGURATIVELY! 👺She has both the prince (Kai and his brother - kitt) wrapped around her finger.THEY BOTH ARE SO SMITTEN 😭, and she was also trying to make Kai her enemy in the start, and ngl prettyyy forced, but glad they lost sight of that lol! I\'m so glad she wasn\'t horny and was pretty annoyed with Kai and wanted nothing with him! Her being attracted to him didn\'t happen quickly, rather it developed slowly but nicely.I won\'t say that her wearing a different color to a ball (where everyone wore green) was pick meHermione Grangervibes lol, but it was definitely cool of her though! Also, SHE\'S THE MAIN CHARACTER SO LET HER SHINE!Her saying \'Gonna stab you in the heart\' was literally the 288262th time. She\'sVicious little thingas he called her. (reminded me of Violet)❝They chose me to die. And all because I saved that prick of a prince.❞•Pae is a thief, and she robbed Kai when he visited the town, and Kai was drawn to her because of the fact that he couldn\'t sense any power from her.Then she saved Kai from a Silencer (one who diminishes power), She caught the eye of everyone as the silver savior, and got selected for Purging Trials — where different trials are taken place for an elite to win. And this year, Kai is a part of them! Now she has to figure out how to SURVIVE because she\'s without power.The whole trials plot was good, but everything was a bit descriptive, and the story was falling into repetition (flirting, banter, and fluff only), and the trials were interesting, but the pace of each of them was different. One taking a lot of chapters, and the other ending in just 3.Many errors in it so the author should def change her editorotherwise everything was fine.

OH MY GOSH~•~•~That ending hurt. A lot.*deep breath* Okay let\'s get started with the review.I absolutely adored this book.The world created is so mesmerizing. The characters and storyline are so compelling. Both the leads- Paedyn and Kai are lovable. I\'ll be honest, this book is not perfect but I enjoyed it regardless.✔️ Magic system✔️ Forbidden romance✔️ Angsty slow burn✔️ Mutual pining✔️ Knife to the throat✔️ Tending to scars✔️ ""Who did this to you?""✔️ He kills for herThe book imostarts off a tad slowbut it\'s completely understandable as we are getting to know the world, the fantasy elements and the characters. It picks up pace towards the middle and stays consistent.An issue I had with this book and which is why it wasn\'t a perfect read for me is the fact that it reminded me TOO MUCH of The Hunger Games.I appreciate when authors take inspiration from a book and make something new with it but the first half of this book was a bit too much replication. This is not to damper anyone\'s expectations but rather give a realistic approach. I still enjoyed it quite a lot which you can see from my updates but it would have been perfect had this issue not existed.I absolutely LOVED the charactersand the complexities that came with them. Kai and Paedyn were imperfectly perfect. They have so much depth and life to them, it was hard to resist them.Kaiis going straight to my book boyfriends list. The man is capable of making me swoon and feel things by merely saying a few words and they don\'t even have to be romantic. He radiates such energy, charisma, and obviously his powers intrigues me a lot. The way he is so smitten with Pae is everything. For him, she is the only girl in the room. For him, she is his and he\'ll do anything to keep her alive and safe.Paedynis no less. She is fierce, equally charismatic and full of zeal and the woman knows how much power she holds in her flirtations, touches over Kai. Her confidence and the ability to stay strong is so impressive. I loved how she holds her own. She tried so hard to resist the charms of the prince and yet found herself wanting him more and I absolutely loved it.The romance is deliciously angsty and slow burning.I get some people are on the surface cause it\'s YA and don\'t really want to give it a go cause of that but believe me you\'re gonna be missing out on the beauty of these two and their intense chemistry. I didn\'t find myself yearning for spice, everything about these two hit perfectly and I wouldn\'t change a thing about it at all.The side characters,Kittin particular, are deeply complex. I saw him destined to become the king that he did at the end, from the beginning. It didn\'t come as a surprise. I found myself sympathizing with him and Kai more so for Pae. I don\'t mind Kitt becoming someone he wasn\'t meant to be, it\'s going to make things immensely interesting. Jax and A were my other favourites.The ending was predictable imo.I saw it coming ages ago so although I wasn\'t completely shocked, it was still impactful and made me excited to read the next one.Overall, an enjoyable read and one I absolutely love. It has the potential of becoming my favorite series but will see how the next books go 😉 What y\'all waiting for? Give it a read!!Like Powerless? Read these-1. The Hunger Games2.

LET\'S GOOO'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'dnf p.308do you ever have the feeling while reading that a book is trying too hard to be something it isn’t?to phrase it simply\'powerless\'has zero originally in it. the book is a replica of many popular books, such asThe Hunger Games, butmake it a cheap and bland AliExpress version. it consisted of recycled scenes jam-packed with tropes that the author was unable to mold to enhance and improve the storyline with. In the end, it appeared that she desperately attempted to sew and combine multiple clichéd scenes to force the protagonists to be in a sort of forced proximity. & it simply did not blend well because the final patchwork felt everything but spontaneous.while the intrigue was compelling enough to dive into the book at first, the unclear and blurry world building made it quite boring after a few chapters. I was under the impression that the author would simplify and distill explanations throughout the story. (how many powers there’s in the wild, for exemple.) but the main question that puzzled the entirety of the book was\'why the trials?\'. i believed it was ancestral, but it wasn\'t. we were not given a concret clarification of why they had to go through them. (solely for the sake of money? sure.)the writing was mediocre to say the least, with an abondance of”blue eyes""not very well dispatched in the narrative. repetitive expressions that clearly underline that the author needs to urgently change editors. the predictability in the dialogues was a major issue for me. It appeared thatKai and Pae were constantly attempting to make the most stereotypical comments. even the king\'s speeches were not as majestic as they should have been.the lack of depth in the characters was the primary reason for my difficulty in going through these 500 pages. why didn\'t the author incorporate any other colors into Pae\'s character other than her still mourning her deceased father? or to Kai to aspire to be more than the future enforcer ? all he does is complain and mop about his obligation to kill people and his brother\'s inability to handle it if the roles where inversed. instead of it being a well depicted enemies to lovers with good character’s wisdom and portrayal it just wavered into them already thinking about each other in a romantic way. all that because the narrative forced them to spend a lot of time with each other.how do you persuade readers to want to continue a trilogy when they aren\'t that attached to the protagonists in the first place?⚠️⚠️⚠️spoilersi did not sign for a love triangle.the way pae inlassably brought up her father’s death and how Kai made strange comments about his first murder seemed like he killed her father not the king.——-here we go..'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'you should know i’m honest to my core when i tell you that i love the author - i think she is an angel of a human being - but i really did not love her book. tragic considering i went in expecting to enjoy it. one day i will stop getting bamboozled by this exact variety of tiktok hype but that day is apparently not today!!!similar to the hunger games i guess if you are ok with nothing making in-universe sense and the reasoning behind it all being “🤷\u200d♀️ i dunno, vibes?” instead of a thoughtful critique of capitalism, commodification, and spectacle.i think i could have gotten past that though (not everything has to be that serious lmfao i am an ali hazelwood fan…i would be throwing stones from a GLASS HOUSE) but the writing was just so over the top and longwinded-but-also-average-fanfiction-vibes in a way that is difficult to capture in a review but that you’d get right away reading the book. it is this very specific style where the author says something, and then says it again but with other words that start with the same letters, and then the sentence has ~parallelism~ but also it is so obviously baked in that it loses any impact. like: ""she was Bold and Beautiful and Beyond my Bountiful expectations."" but x1000 all throughout the book. i found it pretty hard to get through by the end.with that said - i am but one (1) girl, this is a minority opinion. most people i trust online like this book. i think if the writing style doesn’t bother you this could be mindlessly fun a la fourth wing. it doesn\'t take itself particularly seriously. the central relationship is very slow burn and has ample yearning/a decent foundation - though it is quite instalove in terms of their individual feelings, NOT legitimate enemies to lovers (they like each other lmao) and the banter (much like the writing) is often over the top. the story has a mountain of cliches - but they are cliches for a reason. sometimes you just want something silly that is full of all of your guilty pleasure tropes. this was not my experience. but it could be yours, and i hope lauren keeps writing!!!'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3 starsit’s time to be honest.let me start by saying that i didn’t (and still don’t) know who lauren is on booktok. sothis review is unbiased as possible. 🫶🏻(please don’t forget that a 3 stars isn’t a bad rating either.)the first half of this book was nearly a copy and paste of the hunger games.while some readers probablywantthat, it took away from originality for me. i could NOT stop comparing for storyline.

For this being Lauren’s first book, I was impressed. It has a solid storyline and great characters. Overall, I didn’t hate it and can’t wait to see how the story will continue.I will say I wish the world building was more in depth and expanded, along with the characters.

I don’t read much fantasy because im a romance girly but this satisfied me so much. not to mention i was helplessly in love with kai the whole entire time, so that introduced a little bias heheh.🌏 the world building:it wasn’t confusing at all, for once I actually understood what was going on instead of them having the most twisted storyline with the craziest names that you can’t even pronounce. I definitely think this is a good book to get into fantasy, and if you actually wanna see romance and not just crumbs🫂 romanceeee 🫂yall I guarantee youthis will be the best banteryou ever, ever read. it’s too good. they bounce off eachother so well, they flirt SHAMELESSLY and we love to see it hehe.“Promise me you’ll stay alive long enough to stab me in the back?” I laugh loudly. “That’s been my goal all along, prince.”lets ignore the fact thatshe does stab him in the back.. and think about how cute these two are 🤭🤭 seriously one of my new fav couples, the most chemistry ive seen in agess. if this book wasn’t so damn stressful, I’d reread this book until I have it memorised, but I think I’ll just go back and read my fav scenes.🩶 kai azer 🩶i think i read like 10 chapters, and then immediately ran to put him in mybook husbands shelf.I was that confident he was gonna eat, and tbh, without him this is just a mediocre book.“Mark my words, prince, I will be your undoing.” I lean in, ignoring the knife against my throat as murmur, “Oh, darling, I look forward to it.”like come on,how do you not fall in love right after that?if it were me, i’d fold the minute he called me darling. but hey, pae is strong, and we love that.she literally beat all the elites without any powers?that’s just embarrassing for them. i would crumble after task 1. not even after, like five minutes in.🗡️ paedyn gray 🗡️she’s my fav kind of fmc.so strong, but also super funny? and has a backbone whichwe love.only thing I didn’t love ishow badly she treated kitt. believe it or not, I actually liked him. he was kind, he was sweet, he just wanted his father to love him which like who doesn’t you can’t blame him for that. I hope he gets a good ending, maybe not with paeBECAUSE KAIPAE FORVER!!but like in general I don’t want him to die or anything.

Thank you🥰)❗️•It was a Red queen fan fiction.•Zero original ideas.•The last 40 pages were the only interesting and unique plot from the author.•Long boring (bad structured) paragraphs•Wattpad diologue.•Lazy writing.•The Characters reactions made no sense.•Enemies to lovers? More like: forced and lazy interactions to enemies (ig)•Quotes that felt repetitive or were directly written many times in the same page or chapter.⚔️ “Inspired by Red queen and The hunger games” = excuse to not say she copied everything about those two series and changed some aspects or characters in the most lazy way. Example:The cream that cures Katniss and it’s sent from Haymitch is changed into: Kai finding a remedy to cure Paedyn because it might’ve fallen from another person’s pocket. LIKE WHAT?⚔️Everything about the trials was boring and didn’t make any sense. When it first started I was like: Finally! 200 pages of nothing, maybe it gets better and then boom IT NEVER DID.⚔️Paedyn and Kitt had more chemistry than Paedyn and Kai (it felt so forced). They were ALWAYS finding each other (also another way to never develop the other characters that had a lot of potential since they all had different and interesting powers). The “I hate you” but I have no idea why was SO HARD IN THIS BOOK.⚔️When I got to Kai’s POV, he was always saying that she wanted to be enemies but in reality they were always flirting and touching each other because they have to have “quemistry” but apparently you also have to force an enemies to lovers trope because what is revealed at the end has to make sense but it never does. It’s very clear that there is NO reason for you to hate Kai because of his “beauty” and the fact that he remains you of his father. Which also leads me to talk about the king and queen:⚔️THE QUEEN was never there, she loved Kai but never did anything for him. Why? We are given a poor excuse that that was correct for him and he was always destined to become the enforcer and suffer.⚔️THE KING and his personality that didn’t make sense, bother me SO MUCH and let’s not talk about his poor dialogues. He was the reason of all the tragedies and traumas but he was even sharing dinner in the same table with everyone!!!😁You can do that, yes! My problem is that he doesn’t have a well developed personality leading his character to become ridiculous in the eyes of the reader.⚔️And I say instead of forcing Kai and Paedyn to find each other ALL THE TIME use all those pages to make her interact with the other characters like Lenny: cuz wdym he calls you princess and likes you out of nowhere (remember if you’re writing a book you are telling the story to the readers not to you! So even if it looks “obvious” you have to develop that relationship and write it directly)⚔️Also, let’s not talk about the amount of ridiculous nicknames🙄🙄🙄⚔️Adena was there at the beginning and at the end, leaving me like: ok you love her so much but she’s barely mentioned throughout the book.⚔️The father taught her how to fight and he was a healer 💀The characters had NO personality, only plain mid and typical backstories.⚔️If you haven’t read Red Queen then you probably are not going to understand why I said this book is a Red Queen fan fiction:•Adena: Mare’s sister. They both design clothes.•Kai: Cal but with a flirting personality (oh but let’s not forget that we have to force him into a dark “I don’t share my feelings cuz I’m a monster” character.) Also, what’s with Paedyn describing him as a cocky bastard and two pages latter saying that he was this mysterious guy 🧍🏻\u200d♀️.•Kitt: Naive prince who’s clearly becoming the villain at the end: Maven.⚔️And I could go on and on but honestly it bores me to tears to remember all of the characters because that’s what the story was: plain and boring(unnecessarily long).⚔️Like I said: a Fan fiction (dare I say that Red queen was at least more unique) and it felt as if the author wrote this and never check it before publishing it. It was like: here🤲🏻 theres this book that feels incredibly overwhelming and it has a lot of tropes that are a favorite on booktok but I didn’t develop them well.⚔️I’ve said this before and I’m gonna say it again: There is one book on Wattpad that includes royals and everything and it was 100% better than this “book”. So if you read books in Spanish you should definitely give it a try!!! It’s called EL PERFUME DEL REY. (And yes I read this recently so there is no: I read this in 2015 you’ll probably not like it now) The book is also in a physical copy!!! And has illustrations😍⚔️People recommend this saying that is very cheesy and it’s for a younger audience, when in reality there are BETTER books with VERY YA scenes like: Once upon a broken heart that were actually good (I’m 18)⚔️Anyway. I say, read this if you want to but I still think it’s not fair that you have to pay 20$ for something that copied basically everything from other popular books and everyone on booktok is hyping it knowing damn well this has a poor plot and it should be on Wattpad.⚔️Im gonna say this a last time: I paid for this book and I feel like at least I deserve to give my opinion on it and WHY I didn’t like it.I gave it 1⭐️ because Ik there could be more improvement and it’s also very impressive that somebody wrote 500 pages at 18!'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""What in The-Hunger-Games-Divergent-Serpent-and-the-Wings-of-Night-Throne-of-Glass-Young-Elites-Shatter-Me fandom mash-up is this?Disclaimer:I know nothing of the author and don’t keep up with BookTok books, so this review is unbiased in every possible way. Even in moments where I may diss the book, I have absolutely nothing against the author and am open to reading her future releases.That being said, I have lost faith in humanity.I truly do not understand the hype for this. At all. There are so many other, better written fantasy romance novels out there.It wasn’t just that this was unoriginal and bad writing, but the romance was awful, the characters bland, the plot pacing so damn slow with so many pointless scenes, and every plot aspect was absolutely RIDDLED with logistic issues. If you take the time to look at things for half a second, the whole thing falls apart irrevocably.This whole thing hinges upon tropes and other peoples’ nostalgia and love for to all the books I just listed above.People are actually recommending this to fans of The Hunger Games.For the love of God, if you are a true fan of The Hunger Games, DO. NOT. pick this up.This is SO bad that to compare it to that is to make a mockery of the franchise.The concept of The Hunger Games has a sick sort of logic to it that makes sense.This, whatever trials were in Powerless, did not make sense.So the whole conflict in this world is that the king basically kills all the powerless, called Ordinaries, and the Fatals, which are the those who have powers so strong they are a threat to everyone, Ordinary or Elite. He does this to keep the Elites strong and him in power, believing that reproducing with Ordinaries will deplete the Elite’s power overtime.Okay. Fine. But then why would you host the Purging Trials where many of your treasured elites might die?? Not only that, but to contradict again, it’s literally said multiple times that the trials are meant to showcase powers, not to kill other contestants. But with a name like the PURGING trials, what else do you think the contestests are going to do? Come on. Also, most of the contestants are literally childhood friends or acquaintances, and you’re telling me they’re nonchalantly killing them off, when it’s not even required to win the trials? I’m sorry, but I’m not rooting for or sympathizing with ANY of these sadistic characters. This isn’t morally grey, this is pure evil.Building upon the issues I’ve already brought up and my many questions that remain unanswered, the novel is a mess of plot holes.I’m sure most of this is due to the fact that the plot was not born from an idea—whether it be world, character, or plot based. It’s built from a trope, which is never a solid foundation for a book.I am so tired of this new trend of trope-dumping. Sure, tropes are nice, even amazing, in extreme moderation. And even then, thetropes should not be the driving force in a novel or even in plot progression.These are like literary devices, used to elicit a certain atmosphere or feeling, whether in the story or readers. Tropes do not a plot make. They are not a substitute, they are not character building, they are not even effective romance development techniques. So please, for all of our sake, let's move on!There are many more plot holes, but at this point my frustration over it all, while writing this, is becoming unhealthy so I’ll just stop while I’m ahead.There is nothing of substance to the characters.Nothing to differentiate them from one another and nothing to make them anything but the basic stereotypes of whatever role they’re intended to fulfill.Prince Kai is the worst of them all. He’s supposed to be some badass, monstrous assassin for the king. But nothing ever backs up these claims. In fact, Roberts goes so overboard on his charming nature (which is more cringeworthy than actually charming) and his romantic feelings for the FMC that he’s honestly softer than every other character in the novel. Result the exact opposite of the intention, I’m sure.Paedyn has the most pick-me energy that I’ve had the displeasure of reading in recent memory. She screams Wattpad fanfic on the basis of she has no flaws, her only weakness being her supposed love for others and her unparalleled heroism.The dialogue between characters is the worst.I could not keep my face straight when I read it; the secondhand embarrassment was worse than the experience of watching DUFF or Awkward. (Y’all know what I’m talking about, I know you do).The romance is terrible. I tried to think of a better way to put it, but I could not without altering the truth of the matter.Why, why, why do we follow this ridiculous love triangle between Paedyn and the two royal brothers, Kai and Kitt? For one, this screams heavily influenced by Red Queen. For another, the novel is literally a fantasy romance told from the perspectives of Paedyn and Kai. We know it’ll be their romance in the end, because Kitt’s POV is not included. So why waste our time? It literally adds nothing to the story.Onto the actual romance at the forefront of the novel, this is as insta-love as it can possibly get, folks. Sometimes, insta-love is called for, most of the time it’s not. Have I ever liked it either way? Absolutely the fuck not, there’s the door.🚪Kai and Paedyn have no chemistry. How could they when they’re lusting over one another from the moment they lay eyes on each other? Their romance goes from 0-100 REAL QUICK, and I’m talking 30% of the way in. Then, as if the author remembers that, actually, we need to slip the “slow burn” trope in, she decides the characters need to blatantly fawn over one another for damn near the rest of the book but do nothing about it. Literally, what is the purpose? The slow burn doesn’t hit the same if you’ve already solidified the romance in the first 100 pages.Anyway, I did not like this. Pick up some Carissa Broadbent instead, okay folks?""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'This was not good. As a trending booktok book, I didn’t really know what I was getting into because those are always a bit of a toss up, but it was still one of my most anticipated releases.The main issue with Powerless is that it was written FOR social media. It was written around popular tropes even if putting in those tropes was completely out of place and forced. Now listen, I’m not against using popular tropes or anything, but they’re only effective if they come naturally and actually have a reason to be there. It felt completely unoriginal because I had read it all before.And it wasn’t just the tropes that made this book so unoriginal. I swear that this was just a carbon copy of The Hunger Games x Red Queen. The characters were all 2D versions of characters from the Hunger Game, the world building was literally the exact same as in Red Queen except if the Red Queen Universe hosted an annual Hunger Games, and the plot was just a bunch of copy and pasted moments from both. I understand that with fantasy books you’re always going to see some parallels between books, but this was insane. It was so so bad. Every page was deja vu and not in a good way. As someone who loved the Hunger Games (not Red Queen as much but I can respect it), some of this honestly felt a little disrespectful because it was so similar yet there was no meaningfulness or relevance to everything. THG is a commentary on our modern-day capitalist society and so many of the scenes and premises that were blatantly copied in this book actually held incredible importance in THG but were just thrown in with no meaning or thought whatsoever here.Then there was the romance, the reason we’re all here. I feel kind of 50/50 on this because Kai and Paedyn did have some “chef’s kiss” moments, but the tension was so overdone. When you put in so much sexual tension, there comes a point where it’s no longer tense. I also hated how Kai was always calling Pae “darling,” not because I hate that name or anything, but because it was used all the time and felt really forced. I also don’t understand all the nose flicking. Why was Kai always flicking Paedyn’s nose for no apparent reason. That will never not be weird. Nonetheless, it was one of the book’s better aspects which is great because it is, in fact, romantasy.The writing also wasn’t too bad, especially considering that this is a debut novel. However, the use of the term “ocean eyes” was literally criminal and I don’t think I’ll be able to listen to that song again (iykyk). Oh, and “cocky bastard” too. We can do better than that.The world building, like I said before, was completely unoriginal, but it also made about 0 sense. I mean, the whole idea behind the Purging Trials is so that the kingdom can showcase the power of the elites, but the whole thing was so flimsy. Like, you’re going to have a bunch of people with powers go fight each other (and kill each other, although it was never explained if that was the actual goal or what) and film them for… entertainment purposes? Don’t even get me started on the whole history with the Elites and Ordinaries with the Plague and everything. So many plot holes in this regard.I will say that this book was very entertaining and bingeable. Despite the fact that I kind of hated it, it still would be one of my go-to’s for a reading marathon or a long trip or something like that.In the end, this was a huge letdown for me. It really is an interesting example of how social media is effecting the book industry and, while I think there are some good things that come out of this, I really have a lot of issues with it. Honestly, Powerless was so formulaic that it almost felt like it was generated by AI (I know it wasn’t- I’ve been following Lauren Roberts on social media for a while and I’ve seen what she’s put into this book). I know the that a lot of people love this book but it wasn’t for me. 2 stars.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '“But I’m never sober around you, Pae.

Sometimes it can be at the very end of the book where the two characters kiss and it\'s just hard to wait that longi’m kind of impatient when it comes to romance 🙉BUT…. this book kind of changed my perspective a little bit. To say I really liked this is an understatement. It’s such a beautiful, playful and humorous book. The plot the characters especially the characters specifically the female character, PAE!!! She is such a inspiration to all people especially girls!! I just love the way she carried herself and just went through the competition with such grace, passion, and determination. This book also reminded me a lot of my favorite dark romance series Blood and Ash series. The threats of how stabbing turns people on is just giving Casteel from blood and ash and it was like living deja vu all over again. But yeah this book had a little something of everything and I loved it sm!! I will say as someone who isn\'t really a slowburn fan I’m thinking about reconsidering after reading this. 💗 Infinity x Infinity stars all around!!!⚔Main Characters⚔☘Pae☘This girl is my heart and soul!! I love her sm!! She is such a powerful female character. I love how she doesn’t try to just fit in with the other girls. Every chance she got she spoke up and expressed her feelings. And even when she wasn’t trying to she was so funny. Her relationship with Kai is just so cute and so romantic. Ik they didn’t really get a good kiss but Ik they’re is definitely something special for them in the cards. I really hope that she is still able to continue to being herself no matter what even after what happened. Usually its rare to get this much female agency throughout a whole book let alone a series so I’m hoping that she is able to just be true to herself and keep fighting for her relationship with Kai no matter what. Also can we just talk about the dresses she wore with the high slit and the dagger on her thigh and didn\'t even bat an eye at the traditional dresses that everyone had to wear that was all the same color. I’m talking badass girl right there!! 🎀💘💖☘Kai☘Kai is literally the book guy everyone wants. 😍He is so funny and smart. He cares sm eventho he doesn’t seem like he does at first. He literally spared people when he was supposed to kill them And ofc he is absolutely so handsome. Like I was giggling and kicking my feet he was just so cute and so entertaining to read about. And the way he always put caring for Pae over his other duties was just so thoughtful and he is literally on of the best mmc in like book history. And I loved when he was so attentive to Pae and always found some way to crack a joke while flirting was just so swoonworthy. 😋 Like idk how I’m going to survive while Reckless isn’t here yet. And there was one scene I loved sm when they were talking about feelings and she was trying to put her walls up and he like next time don’t tap your left foot and lie to me. Like somehow he just knew.⚔Side Characters⚔The were all pretty decent the best friend was my favorite. She was so sweet and I wish things could have been better (if you know you know) I’m not even going to talk about the father I didn’t like him at all. But the brother ofc I ended up liking him too especially when he was flirting with Pae �� but midway I kinda just stopped idk why I just think he wasn’t that interesting like I thought.⚔Best Couple Moments⚔🌸Their 1st\xa0 meet up🌱Gifted her a knife🌸Kai putting food on Pae’s plate for her bc she was refusing to eat and she seemed shy🌱Their little fights🌸Their dance lessons🌱Everytime he called her darling🌸Her favorite color is blue bc she loves his eye color🌱He helped her through her panic attack🌸He wrote on his arm ‘she said I could touch her when I’m sober’🌱Pae comforting Kai during his nightmare🌸Their picnic in the garden⚔Favorite Scenes⚔▪︎“Do you always fall into the arms of handsome strangers, or is it a new thing for you?” (Kai)“No, only the cocky ones.” (Pae)“Well looks like I’ve made quite the first impression then. Your clumsiness found me, so I hardly call it a curse.” (Kai)▪︎”Kai, I’m not leaving.” (Pae)“Then don’t think I won’t throw you over my damn shoulder and carry you out of here myself. Is that what you want?” (Kai)▪︎”Maybe because you have to be a gentleman to be gentlemanly.” (Pae)“And who says I’m not?” (Kai)“I’d like to find someone who says you are.” (Pae)▪︎”Well maybe if you’d kept your eyes on the dance floor and your nose out of your glass, we wouldn’t be in this situation.” (Pae)“Oh, darling, my eyes were on the dance floor. They were on you dancing with my brother. Why do you think I’ve been drinking?” (Kai)▪︎”Do share her with the other gentlemen, wont you?” (Kai’s mom)“She’s mine for the night, Mother.” (Kai)▪︎”I could get used to you being a gentleman, Azer.” (Pae)“And I could get used to being one for you, Gray.” (Kai)▪︎”I’m a fool.” (Kai)“Only when you\'re around me?” (Pae)“Only for you.” (Kai)⚔Favorite Quotes⚔▪︎”Oh, don’t worry, Father, I won’t make the mistake of showing up to the throne room without a shirt.

Next time we fight, impress me.” (Pae)▪︎”By all means, carry on. I’ll never deny myself the chance of watching you watch me.” (Kai)▪︎”Remind me to make you smile like that again, when you aren’t dying, and I have all the time in the world to memorize it.” (Kai)▪︎”I’m going to ask again. Who did this to you?” (Kai)▪︎“Oh, I’m not making you do anything, darling. You can leave me to bleed out if you must. Because I only want your hands all over me if you want them to be.” (Kai)▪︎”You know. I’m beginning to think that you enjoy getting hurt, if only so you can have my hands all over you.” (Kai)▪︎”Who needs a pillow when I have you?” (Kai)▪︎”You know you didn’t have to spill my drink all over me to get me alone.” (Kai)▪︎”It’s not the winning that I find fun. It’s you, darling.” (Kai)▪︎“But I’m never sober around you, Pae. Never not drunk on every detail that is you.” (Kai)⚔The Ending⚔The ending was so messy and heartbreaking and I was crying sm!! 😭 Like idk what to even say. I think it was kinda something we all knew partly bc of events that led up to it. However what happened with Kai was shocking bc usually stuff like that has gone differently but ih this was a new twist to the book which was so heartbreaking. And like the history with their fathers was crazy. I wish I could say more but I don\'t want to spoil it for those who haven\'t read it.⚔Hopes for Reckless⚔🌱More Kai and Pae romance🌸The ending resolved🌱More humor⚔Last Thoughts⚔I really liked this book a lot and I\'m hoping the next one delivers and it doesn\'t end up like the way Ruthless Vows was.

Once Upon a Broken Heart (Once Upon a Broken Heart, #1)
",Stephanie Garber,4.06,432957,1428,"Fantasy, Romance, Young Adult, Romantasy, Fantasy Romance, Fiction, Young Adult Fantasy",408,28-09-2021,"How far would you go for happily ever after?For as long as she can remember, Evangeline Fox has believed in true love and happy endings... until she learns that the love of her life will marry another.Desperate to stop the wedding and to heal her wounded heart, Evangeline strikes a deal with the charismatic but wicked Prince of Hearts. In exchange for his help, he asks for three kisses, to be given at the time and place of his choosing.But after Evangeline’s first promised kiss, she learns that bargaining with an immortal is a dangerous game—and that the Prince of Hearts wants far more from her than she’d pledged. He has plans for Evangeline, plans that will either end in the greatest happily ever after or the most exquisite tragedy...","[{'rating': 1, 'content': ""To put it simply,Once Upon a Broken Heartis a hot mess. The premise promises a fairytale, but what Garber delivers is a confused nightmare. With an annoyingly-naïve protagonist, a one-dimensional cast of supporting characters and a truly “what the fuck”-inducing plot, this book’s only saving graces are the short chapters and fast pacing, which at times can too be a hindrance to your enjoyment and desire to rate this book higher than you actually will.The beginning chapters of this book are the only thing that delivers on the premise. With vivid imagery, they instantly drew me in and I could see the improvement in Garber’s writing from the six (boring) chapters I had read ofCaraval. (As you can guess, that didn’t last very long).Once Upon a Broken Heartfollows rose gold-haired Evangeline Fox, whose stepsister is set to marry Luc, her one true love. Believing Luc to be cursed and desperate to stop the wedding, she enlists the help of Jacks, a Fate and the Prince of Hearts. He agrees to do so under the condition that Evangeline will kiss 3 people of his choosing, but doesn’t say any more than that. Willing to do whatever it takes to stop Luc marrying Marisol, she agrees to the deal but the wedding is stopped by Jacks turning everyone to stone. It is here that Evangeline first displays her wishy-washy personality, as she regrets her actions and drinks the poison that turned the bride, groom and wedding guests to stone – thereby taking their place.Evangeline, as a protagonist and narrator, frustrated me endlessly. She’sinsanelynaïve, always trusting people she shouldn’t and wanting to help Marisol (her stepsister) when it’svery obviousthat a) her sister is shady and up to no good and b) she generally has no reason to. The two of them have next to no relationship, but because Evangeline is so Wonderful and Perfect and Special Because She Has Pink Hair, of course she has to want to help. She’s also a very passive character: things happentoher, notbecauseof her. Now, I know what you’re probably thinking: “Characters are allowed to be naïve! It’s part of their growth!” or “Characters are allowed to be nice! They don’t all have to be sword-wielding assassins or (insert other character trope here)”. Trust me, I hear you, but there’s a difference betweenthose charactersand Evangeline Fox.The side characters – yes, including Jacks – in this book are no better. They’re all one-dimensional and flat, having one ‘unique’ aspect about them… and that’s it. I could tell you hardly anything about them. Jacks’ past with Donatella is briefly mentioned, but I wouldn’t really class that as him having personality, and I think it’s more fanservice for existingCaravalfans than anything.I can separate this book into two parts: Before Evangeline Drinks the Poison and After Evangeline Drinks the Poison. I enjoyed the Before part, as After Evangeline Drinks the Poison is where Stephanie Garber seems to have forgotten the novel she promised to readers, and began writing something else entirely. Ergo, the plot had gone haywire.The book’s plot follows no clear structure; it’s all over the place. Sure, there’s a little bit of “action” but that does nothing to redeem a story that is 99% Boring and 1% Interesting Scenes. There were numerous attempts at romantic scenes throughout the book, but Evangeline has no real chemistry with either of her potential love interests (one of them is literally cursed to be in love with her, so there’s that), so it did nothing for me and I skim-read most of them.Once Upon a Broken Hearttook an extremely bizarre turn after the introduction of vampires. Yes, you read that correctly. Vampires. What the fuck are vampires doing in this book? It was so completely and utterly random, I was honestly thinking ‘what was Stephanie Garber on when she wrote this?’ while reading. We were given no real explanation as to why vampires were included either. It was like a complete abuse of authorial power on Garber’s part: she thought vampires were cool, soshe just put them in the book, with no real thought as to the sense (or lack thereof) it would make. And trust me, it madezero sense. Unfortunately, around the last third of the book and its “plot” hinges on vampires, so there wasn’t any escaping them.There was also a prophecy subplot, becauseof course there was. The prophecy in this book centres around the Valory Arch, a mysterious archway in The North which contains either treasure and secrets or deadly monsters (no one is really sure which). Evangeline, having such Main Character Energy, is the key to unlocking this arch/doorway (I get she literally IS the main character, but just roll with the punches here). I say it’s a subplot, but I honestly couldn’t tell you what was the main plot and what were subplots in this book. Garber weaved a lot of threads throughoutOnce Upon a Broken Heart, and they got tangled up at times.As a ‘minor’ complaint, a lot is told to readers and not shown. For instance, after Evangeline has just woken up from being poisoned, she is told of a Week of Terrors that unfolded after the cancelled wedding, but we’re not given any information about it. Later, through dialogue, Evangeline learns of information she needs to know to progress the plot, but it’s done in quite a heavy-handed manner. There’sa lotof it, and wasn’t done subtlety or in small pieces, like you might see elsewhere in other novels.To give myself something positive to say about this book, I did like its short chapters and relatively fast pacing. As a slow reader, I appreciated being able to get through this book super quickly. Yes, that’s all I have to say. Moving on!The book ends on a cliffhanger. It’s somewhat intriguing, but I certainly won’t be reading the sequel. If for whatever reason, after reading this review, you’re still inclined to readOnce Upon a Broken Heart, you might want to hold off on doing so until the sequel is out, as this will leave you with too many loose plot threads and unanswered questions – more than any book should.Thank you to Kate Keehan and Hodder & Stoughton for the eARC!↠ 1 starBookstagram✦BookTwitter✦BookTok15/04/2024: I'm far too late in adding this, but if you're looking for a YA fantasy series (with enemies to lovers, morally grey characters, and corruption arcs) that will actually be worth your time, may I direct your attention toThe Kinder Poisonby Natalie Mae!""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""4 starsThis is one of the most interesting worlds I've encountered in fantasy books. Everything was so dreamy, and I might've enjoyed reading about cards if I'd read Caraval. The first book is interesting enough to finish this series quickly. I wanna read it slowly & enjoy it while wanting to finish it quickly because it's so GOOD!❝For anyone who has ever made a bad decision because of a broken heart.❞This dedication is enough to make you want to read this book! I LOVE IT AND NEXT BIO IS GONNA BE THIS ONE! 🙌🏻😭• Evangeline went to thePrince of Heart'schurch thinking that her prayer might be answered by Fate – prince of Hearts – and the wedding of her lover would be stopped. Desperate and heartbroken enough, she made a deal with fate to stop her lover's wedding in exchange for three kisses with people he choose.The Prince of Hearts has such a certain vibe! His kiss is deadly, his heart doesn't beat, and the most important – he's heartbroken and is cursed to never find love, which gives Eva hopes that he might help her. Their first interaction was so funny, and I was getting second-hand embarrassments from her behalf! I didn't expect Jacks to be such a meanie! 😭❝People who don’t like me call me Jacks.❞Jacks– he's the cursed prince of hearts who's a manipulator, a toxic person who'll do anything to gain what he wants, and cocky. BUT WHY DOES HE HAVE TO BE SO HOT AND PERFECT? It'll always be the villain and never the hero besides.... the hero never gets a happy ending! 🤭 The hype for him is real, and I see myself falling in love with him, just like I did with Aaron Warner 😮\u200d💨I'm literally a simp for him atp! Him doing mundane things like tossing the apple, slicing the apple, BITING THE APPLE had me swooning! ANDDDD HE HADDDD NOOO RIGHT TO BE SOOOO HOT IN THIS SCENEEE!!!!! 👇🏻❝What am I supposed to do with this [dagger]?❞❝You might want to use it, Little Fox.❞ The corner of his mouth twitched as he slowly slid his pale hands through the bars of the gate and broke the lock in half. It could have been a twig, a piece of paper, or her.Evangeline Fox— she's just a naive girl with a hopeless romantic personality, and well, she's quite delusional but would call herself hopeful! She has been surrounded by so many fairy tales that she just wants her life to be like it. She's smack-dabbed in the face with the realities, but she'd rather create alternatives to not tarnish the image of people she cares about. I actually liked her selflessness and her acceptance of her BAD DECISION. But there's nothing much interesting to her character besides this.Not a huntress or amazing at fighting too lmao. So far, she's a hopeless romantic who's kind of attracted to Jacks because he's a baddie but doesn't want to die either by kissing him.Enemies to lovers— their dynamic is so good? Evangeline has hot and cold feelings for him. She's torn between wanting to kiss him or hate him. Jacks being absolutely mean with her one moment and saying things HE SHOULDN'T the next moment were too much to handle and him calling her LITTLE FOX 💞🤭❝Do you want to be a vampire?❞❝No,❞Jacks spat.❝I don’t want to be a vampire, but I do want to bite you.❞SIR????? 😮\u200d💨🧎\u200d♀️🥵😭❝You might not like me, but I bet you’d like it if I kissed you.❞Jacks... wdym IT WAS ENTERTAINING TO SEE HER KISS APOLLO AND THAT OLD LADY FORTUNA ??? 😭 That was really unnecessary, but he just wanted to toy with Eva by making her kiss them! He outright accepted that he manipulated her. He's actually evil in this book regardless of his past, and he threatened her subtly that she'd die if she didn't agree with her part of the bargain. I'm all but patient for his character development and just to see his softie side, after all, a glimpse of it when he carried her through the cold just to take her to get a cure for the poison she got and let her sleep in his arms the whole night , was just 😭💞❝You could have unlocked me as well❞— I was wondering if Jacks had indulged her and struck a deal with her in the first place because she opened the church's door. It's known she can open Valory Arch, but maybe that was the time when Jacks realized that she's the rose-gold haired girl who's the one who can open the arch. and he didn't know her before.Apollo being in love was so funny! I only liked that scene where they were talking and he was being nice, but otherwise, he was really quick to dismiss Eva in the first place, and Marisol is just a bitch! I just knew something was sus about her since the start because no one is too kind, and she's after all her mother's child, and yep she definitely stole Luc. I knew Jacks is evil! I do love him, but he's so manipulative, and the ending actually shocked me! I still hate Marisol because she's a bitch, but damn the way Jacks went through so much just to frame her and wrongly accused Eva just to get the prophecy right 😮\u200d💨🤚🏻 and yeahhh 4 stars just because, it had wayy too much info dumps!

The prince only asks for three kisses. But after Evangeline’s first promised kiss, she learns that the Prince of Hearts wants far more from her than she’d pledged.

I absolutely loved it, I found it so quick and easy to read, I didn’t need to think very hard. But I know that this writing style won’t suit everyone’s tastes. I also loved the enchanting world that Garber created. I was swept away by magic, miniature dragons that can make delicious treats and true love.I feel so confused now that I’ve finished reading because I still have no idea what’s actually going on and who can be trusted.Garber was able to completely blindside me with one twist which I always love. I also adored how the different truths and layers were slowly peeled back, showing quite a complex plot and characters. Each unfurling layer brought new revelations and questions.

So, essentially the majority of people who will stumble on this review have already read it and are quite familiar.However, since the first time I read this series was back in January and before I was writing proper reviews, I just wanted to jot down a few of my feelings and honestly gush alittleLOT 💕✨- I don\'t reread books often, when I do it\'s because I LOVE them in such an unbelievably enormous way.˚ ༘✶ ⋆｡˚ ⁀➷The world building - omg, flawless...SG so effortlessly weaved this colorful, imaginative, magical and fairy-tale esk world. As soon as you turn the first page you are transported to this dreamlike world that totally speaks to the little girl in me full of princes, princesses, creatures both good and bad- and of course the wicked Prince of Hearts with undeniable swag that you can\'t help but love.Contributing to the book’s appeal is its world building. Once upon a Broken Heart explores a part of the Caraval universe that was hitherto only mentioned in passing: the North. Shrouded in lore and steeped in magic and curses, the North makes for a mesmerizing backdrop and enhances the fairytale-like feel of the story.Wandering through its whimsical streets and harrowing underground is a vicarious adventure. Danger, excitement, and suspense: we get to experience them all from the safety of our sofas.It is trulyunputdownable!ꕤ ⋯ ♡ᵎ“The fates weren\'t dangerous because they were evil; the fates were dangerous because they couldn\'t tell the difference between evil and good.”ꕤ ⋯ ♡ᵎ“He was still indescribably breathtaking, but it was all the tragic beauty of a sky where every single star was falling. His hair was a storm of broken gold. His eyes were a mess of silver and blue.”➽─────────❥For me, Jacks is honestly one of the most compelling characters I have read in a while. I was pulled into his character starting with the Caraval series (Not required but totally recommend reading first)When I first met him he comes across as this tortured character, not to be confused with a tortured hero- he does terrible things for his own advantage but then you get glimpses of a softer, more caring side, making him villainous on one hand and with some of his other actions more anti-hero/quasi-hero.*I\'m literally dying, I love him-SWOON*˚ ༘✶ ⋆｡˚ ⁀➷Jacks gave her a smile that was all sharp edges. A drop of blood fell from the corner of his mouth, and something godforsaken washed over his expression. ""Hurt is what made me.”-`♡´- “He held on to her as if she were a grudge, his body rigid and tense, as if he really didn\'t want her there, and yet his arms were tight around her waist as though he had no intention of ever letting her go.”-`♡´-Evangeline, our FMC is in some ways similar to Jacks, not that she is villainous but she has certainly made some questionable decisions for her own gain. She is more or less prone to letting her desires influence her decisions.There\'s this push and pull between the two of them that I find so delicious. Readers of Caraval understand Jacks\'s reluctance to give into temptation - for those of us that love these morally gray characters - Jacks is it. You can\'t help but wish for him to win the girl.⁀➴ˎˊ˗“I don\'t know if I can fix your broken heart, but you can take mine because it\'s already yours.”“But you have to have a working heart for it to break.”༉‧₊˚.Evangeline seems to be more hesitant based on Jacks\'s reputation, fully accepting who he is and the things he has been done, or is rumored to have done. You can feel the magnetic pull that they have on one another, and when they give in to that pull, sparks fly (like in the mausoleum scene – if you know, you know 😉).Full stop- waiting with total baited breath to see what happens with these two.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 're-read [Oct. 17, 2023]: 5⭐""Heroes don\'t get happy endings.

",Sally Rooney,3.81,1567053,1416,"Fiction, Contemporary, Literary Fiction, Audiobook, Ireland, Adult, Coming Of Age",273,28-08-2018,"At school Connell and Marianne pretend not to know each other. He’s popular and well-adjusted, star of the school soccer team while she is lonely, proud, and intensely private. But when Connell comes to pick his mother up from her housekeeping job at Marianne’s house, a strange and indelible connection grows between the two teenagers - one they are determined to conceal.A year later, they’re both studying at Trinity College in Dublin. Marianne has found her feet in a new social world while Connell hangs at the sidelines, shy and uncertain. Throughout their years in college, Marianne and Connell circle one another, straying toward other people and possibilities but always magnetically, irresistibly drawn back together. Then, as she veers into self-destruction and he begins to search for meaning elsewhere, each must confront how far they are willing to go to save the other.Sally Rooney brings her brilliant psychological acuity and perfectly spare prose to a story that explores the subtleties of class, the electricity of first love, and the complex entanglements of family and friendship.","[{'rating': 4, 'content': ""“Life offers up these moments of joy despite everything.”(see my instagram review:https://www.instagram.com/p/C2zr6VgLlVN/)The first time I read this, I rated it three stars. While this can be considered relatively high for me (don’t check my average rating, it will only bring despair to us both), it is approximately two stars lower than what I expected to rate this book.I adore Rooney’s prior novel, Conversations with Friends, to a degree that is almost disturbing. Or possibly just disturbing.But this one fell flat for me. In a way that was difficult, at the time, to put a finger on. While I encountered the same stellar, almost painful writing, and the same reading experience so all-encompassing that it felt like it changed something fundamental about me, while I loved the characters so much that my concern for their well-being stressed me out, I did not come away from this book in love.I put a finger on what the thing keeping me and this book away from eternal love and matrimony was.It’s because I was sad.The first time I read this, I was so wrapped up in the characters and their lives and my concern for them that I overlooked...everything else. To me this was the story of Connell and Marianne and nothing else, and while I adored them both I missed out on the multitude of nuances and themes and symbols at play. The treatment of privilege and wealth, the examination of capitalism through relationships, the look at what love and self-worth mean, the submission and sometimes humiliation that is love.This is a gorgeous book, and a beautifully written one, and the second read of this enthralled me so much I lived in the story for a week.For once, I’m at a loss for what else to say.Bottom line: I was wrong, okay!!! There’s a first time for everything.p.s. In the original review I say that I'll never reread this book. That wrongness counts as the same one.---------------------reread 2 updatesi am swiftly abandoning this reread because i'm not enjoying it and i'm scared.update: resuming in light of how soon sally rooney's next book is coming out. still scared.update to the update: this stays 4 stars!---------------------reread pre-reviewraising this from 3 to 4 stars upon reread, so guess i have to rewrite this review.oh, the twists and turns life takes.review to come / 4 stars---------------------reread 1 updatesmaybe someday i will be the kind of person who doesn't take every excuse to reread, but today is not that day---------original reviewWhen I finished this book, I didn’t even rate it. I couldn’t. I had no clue how to even approach such a thing.I still don’t.That’s because I loved reading every single word of this (because every single word of this was written by Sally Rooney), but I also, in a much more real way, did not enjoy at all.Conversations with Friends, which I five starred, reread just a few months after my first read, and have not stopped thinking about, is not an easy book to read. I adore it, but I did not enjoy every second of it.Far from it, actually. That book’s characters are part of my heart, but I didn’t necessarilylikethem. I felt intensely and deeply known by its story, and that process doesn’t necessarily feel like a walk in a park.Well, maybe it is. But on one of those days where when you first go outside the temperature is perfect in a long-sleeve shirt, but then you spend every minute outside growing slightly chillier to the point of discomfort. And you’re excited to see the park has little ice-cream carts, but then you realize the process of eating the ice cream ultimately won’t live up to your imagining of it, and you don’t really like ice cream all that much anyway.If that’s Conversations with Friends…Normal People is a walk in a park during a blizzard. Without a jacket. And to distract yourself you have an ongoing internal monologue that’s actually sort of brilliant, you’re in rare form, and that’s great and all but it’s not quite enough to distract from the fact that all of this seems pointless and rather painful.It really seems to me that Rooney abandoned the gorgeous, deep characterizations and slow-moving stories of Conversations in favor of making characters vessels for themes.And I’ve simply never been that kind of a reader. I read FOR the characters, not around them.I didn’t much care for Connell and Marianne, nor their romance (if you can call it that). I couldn’t click with their arcs or their escapades or much of anything, besides Rooney’s writing. (Which was unchangedly amazing and possibly even better.)There were also some things about this that made me feel...icky. Sexual submission (specifically Marianne’s) is used as a metaphor here, and never kindly. This behavior of hers is presented as negative, usually, but it’s also inarguable that Marianne is submissive in her relationship with Connell, and that is never resolved. Connell feels unhappy several times over about the degree of her power over her, and while they return to their relationship contentedly towards the end, this is not at all resolved.I missed the lovely, tied-strings ending of Conversations.Conversations made me feel heard, made my heart and brain feel full, and Normal People made me feel...almost dumb. As if I was missing something that would have helped me put it all together, and without it of course it felt incomplete, silly, because I didn’t have the intellectual capacity to complete it.It’s possible this just isn’t the book I needed, when Conversations with Friends certainly was.It was still written by Sally Rooney, though.Bottom line: I will never reread this. Also I desperately need more Rooney.Update: I reread.---------------------pre-reviewi......cannot even rate this right now.review to come, when i regain the ability to think---------------------tbr reviewi want Sally Rooney to write my internal monologue""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Disclaimer: I understand thatNormal Peopleis very popular and much beloved. While I recognise that Rooney has talent, I foundNormal Peopleto be a mediocre read. If you dislike reading reviews expressing opinions different from your own, well, I suggest you skip this review. There are plenty of glowing reviews out there for this novel so there really is no need for you to waste your time leaving me a comment along the lines of \'you are wrong and here\'s why\'. Also, note that I wrote this review in 2018 and not recently.If you believe that characters who dislike themselves, shrug a lot, and say ""I don\'t know"" 24/7, are very deep and realistic, well this may be the perfect read for you.Or if you enjoy reading about ""in"" authors...look no further.If you are thinking about reading this novel, I suggest you listen toCrywank\'s \'Song for a Guilty Sadist\'instead, since it will take you less time and you will get the same story.At first I enjoyed Rooney\'s style, the way in which she juxtaposed ordinary moments with emotionally charged ones and the uncertainty that pervaded her story, but I soon found her style rather hollow and impersonal, in a manner that soon became predictable. There was a flatness to her voice that seemed affected, and gave her story an artificial quality. I had the impression that Rooney was trying to conjure a certain millennial ""vibe"" through her characters and their experiences, one that isn\'t all that effective or interesting.The central figures of her novel, Connell and Marianne, lacked depth and, as stupid as it might sound, character. Their looks were emphasised in a way that made them ""stand out"" from others: they are skinny and beautiful, they smoke, they make languid movements, they are smart, and unlike their peers they actually care about world politics. Throughout the course of this novel we are told howdifferentandspecialthey are, that\'s literally me type of characters.Marianne comes from a wealthy and abusive family (we are supposed to feel bad for her), Connell was raised by his mother and suffers from bouts of anxiety and depression (we are also supposed to feel bad for him). That they have issues that they can\'t cope with is realistic, but what I didn\'t appreciate is the romanticising of their difficulties. What I didn\'t like is that being ""alienated"" is synonym of ""cool"" and that seeking sadomasochistic relationships is understandable/inevitable if you come from an abusive family (i understand that this happens, and a lot of media manages to portray this reality, that of being a victim who either choose or fall into toxic relationship, or actively seek partners or friendships that emulate old patterns of abuse, with nuance, depth even. but rooney doesn\'t, for all her attempts at candid reality, her depiction of this struck me as sentimental and simplistic).Rooney handles serious issues (eg. an abusive family, depression, etc.) very badly (a book that handles trauma and self-harming incredibly well isWhat Red WasbyRosie Price), there we seewhythe characters behave in self-destructive ways, but in NP these things seemmerely props).Marianne and Connell aren\'t terrible people but god, they are so self-involved. Their relationship is made to appear fraught but I didn\'t always understand why. Drama for the sake of drama? They enter forgettable relationships with equally forgettable people but they remain fixated on each other.Why?No one knows...Marianne is depicted by the author and the other characters as being the sort of person who does not to care about others\' opinion of her but soon after a breakup with a cliched dick boyfriend she is obsessed with what people are saying about her...Connor is...intelligent? Indecisive? As interesting as a stale sandwich?!Secondary characters and family members are barely sketched out, they have little to no purpose other than creating more ""drama"" for the main characters. Marianne\'s family was so badly written that I had a hard time taking any of them seriously. Her brother is laughably cruel and her mother is uncaring and snobbish (they are rich so...). Friends from college serve very little purpose, other than making the main characters seem ""different"" and ""real"" (they are special, not like other people).What I disliked the most is that by the end neither Marianne or Connell show any sort of character growth/change. Not that I always want to read about characters who learn from their mistakes or gain some sort of insight from their experience, I can appreciate characters who keep perpetuating their \'bad\' behaviour or even those who get worse or regress into \'bad\' habits/behaviour, some of my favourite novels feature characters unable or unwilling to put an end to their self-sabotaging ways. But they have to be believable. Marianne or Connell were not. They were merely an \'aesthetic\', more befitting as subjects of a black and white grunge photo than anything else.The only reason why I finished this novel is that I listened to the audiobook and the narrator managed to make this otherwise unappetising storyline sort of okay.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Let it be known that I found this book both exhilarating and almost unbearably frustrating. About halfway through the book I literally lied down on my couch and screamed to my empty apartment, “Connell, you aresuchan incompetent communicator, I swear to God herself if you don’t help yourself I’m going to loathe every person named Connell I ever encounter for the rest of my life.” Even though I’m giving this book 2 stars, it’s more out of how invested I felt in the characters and how little I felt Sally Rooney capitalized on their potential, and not out boredom – I felt anything but bored reading this novel.I will start with what I liked aboutNormal Peoplebefore I continue roasting Connell. Now having read bothConversations with FriendsandNormal People, I find Rooney’s dialogue so, so sharp and entertaining. It’s witty and interesting and realistic, smart yet sincere enough so that it rarely feels pretentious. Some combination of how she writes dialogue and scenes is just so compelling, like I felt propelled to keep reading even when I felt tired of Connell and Marianne and their poor choices. Rooney also weaves in astute commentary about class and socioeconomic status. A few of the passages about class really made me pause and reflect on my own socioeconomic privilege, which I appreciate. At the same time, my best friend pointed out how ultimately Marianne and Connell’s whiteness both afford them the opportunity to be continually mediocre in ways that people of color are often not given, which I agree with.Which brings me to my main critique of this book: Connell and Marianne’s relationship felt so, so annoying and inhibiting. It honestly felt like reading an interpersonal train wreck that I could not look away from, even though I would have much rather looked at anything else (e.g., attractive actors like Steven Yeun, BlackPink music videos, the ceiling of my apartment, etc.) On one hand, I totally get and appreciate that people miscommunicate with one another and experiencing or working through miscommunications is part of life. But Connell and Marianne’s miscommunication literally drives the plot of this book for like, the first 200 pages, and even after that they never really have an explicit conversation about their communication and its indirectness? The majority of this book felt like: Marianne and Connell are intimate, then they have a miscommunication (probably caused by Connell), then they somehow reunite and are intimate again, but then they have another miscommunication (also probably Connell’s fault, like yes I get class factors into this but dang he’s a poor communicator), then they’re intimate, then they miscommunicate, etc. until the end.Finally, I felt like Marianne’s character had so much unexplored depth and potential. She goes through so much: abandonment, familial abuse, trauma and disordered eating, to name a few. Rooney did such a nice job showing some of the effects of her experiences on her psyche and view of relationships. Yet, instead of really going deeper into her struggles or her potential path to healing, Rooney dedicates the majority of the book to Marianne’s relationship with Connell, which I found almost insulting to Marianne’s character. I recognize I may be being a bit harsh here, on one hand I get that Marianne is desperate for some form of healthy connection as we all are to some extent, yet I so, so wish Rooney had given Marianne the chance to heal or develop more within the scope of the novel, so we could see that on the page and feel that hope for her. Instead, toward the very end of the book, Marianne essentially attributes all the goodness in her life to Connell, which made me blanch a little (while sitting on the same couch in which I cursed Connell’s name).Despite my 2-star rating of this novel and my 3-star rating ofConversations with Friends, I still feel somewhat compelled to try out whatever book Rooney publishes next, just because of the sheer addictiveness of her dialogue. There is some quality content inNormal People, about consent and power within sex, about mental health and help-seeking as well. I wish there had been more growth for these characters, outside of their relationship, especially for Marianne.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'No one can be independent of other people completely, so why not give up the attempt, she thought, go running in the other direction, depend on people for everything, allow them to depend on you, why not.This is going to be a polarizing book. I mean, IthinkI liked it. And I say ""liked it"" in the sense that it made me very miserable. It is a quiet character study, almost a YA novel but not quite, and it is aprofoundly lonely and depressing love story.I didn\'t begin by liking it.Normal Peoplefollows two characters - Marianne and Connell - through adolescence and into early adulthood, and they begin by being the kind of uber-precocious teenagers who read Proust and Marx for fun. It took a while for me to settle into their story. My initial impression was that this was going to be some kind ofJohn Greenfor adults, which is not something that floats my particular boat.Without fully realizing it though, this book had crept quietly under my skin. The relationship between Marianne and Connell is angsty, sure, but it felt painfully real. They are so flawed, marred by unlikable characteristics, and yet,I could not stop caring about them.Not for the first time Marianne thinks cruelty does not only hurt the victim, but the perpetrator also, and maybe more deeply and more permanently. You learn nothing very profound about yourself simply by being bullied; but by bullying someone else you learn something you can never forget.The story is really just about the two of them and their relationship. In high school, Marianne is a smart and wealthy girl, but is socially ostracized and emotionally abused at home, whereas Connell is working class, but very popular. Connell\'s mum works as a cleaner for Marianne\'s family. They begin a secret sexual relationship that falls apart when Connell fears his friends will find out. The compelling dynamic between them drives the story-- issues of class and social status cause much conflict.In college, the two meet again. This time, Marianne is popular, and Connell is feeling increasingly depressed. The two of them lean on each other time and again as they move through a social world filled with social expectations. There\'s a bit of aWhen Harry Met Sallyvibe, except that this book is more soul-destroying.Nothing had meant more to Rob than the approval of others; to be thought well of, to be a person of status. He would have betrayed any confidence, any kindness, for the promise of social acceptance.There\'s clear criticism of our constant need to impress and perform for others in a world that grows ever more connected. Much of the tragedy that befalls Marianne and Connell is caused by other people, peer pressure and social expectations. It is very sad to think that someone might give up who they love the most because they can\'t deal with how it makes them look to others.The pair\'s inability to adequately communicate is frustrating but feels realistic. I was on the verge of tearing my hair out at all the things left unsaid in this book, but I think it was a good kind of frustration. The kind that comes from caring too much.I feel like there are any number of reasons I could have hatedNormal People, but I didn’t. I actually kinda loved it. It\'s a weird, awkward, depressing novel about a connection formed between two very different people who find exactly what they need - and perhaps a lot that they don\'t - in each other.CW: sexual assault; domestic abuse; drug use; casual racism (called out); depression; anxiety; suicide & suicidal ideation.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""***NO SPOILERS***This is one of the most overrated books I've read in a long time, and I'mstunnedit was long-listed for the Women's prizeandthe Booker prize (but then, I usually dislike what's chosen for that). The critics are gushing over it too. A professional review I saw in “Book Page” calls it “wise and wondrous.” I ask this:How? How is Rooney’s message “wise”? Show me what’s “wondrous.” I’ve read wondrous and wise many times before. Those are the transportive books I never forget. They overwhelm me in the best way. Everything aboutNormal Peopleunderwhelmed me.Although Rooney’s simplistic prose makesNormal Peopleeasy to read, the book is poorly organized, overly sexual, plot-less, and ultimately never comes together in a satisfying way. Considering how ordinary, often boring, most people’s lives are, her book actuallyisabout “normal people,” but I expect authors to dress up the everyday. I expect tension, some drama, maybe a little suspense. I need a plot with a compelling reason for being. Normal people’s lives don’t make for good stories as they are; they require tinkering. A story about two friends-with-benefits who are confused about what they mean to each other isn’t a story. It’s merely the rough outline for a layered, more meaningful story.Rooney’s intention was a story about miscommunication between close friends as they grow and have various life experiences—except there is no miscommunication. The characters are clear about how they feel. They profess their love for each other more than once. They have sex all the time. They show each other care and consideration. What I saw was unexplainable hesitance. In high school Marianne is unpopular and rich; Connell is popular and poor, so early on this difference drives their hesitance and makes sense. I thought then thatNormal Peoplewas going to be an exploration of how class and social difference can harm a relationship, a kind of contemporaryRomeo and Juliet. Instead Rooney dropped this as soon as the characters move on to college, and their hesitance no longer makes sense.Where these characters’ class differences are concerned, development is shallow. Rooney didn’t illustrate how Marianne is unpopular and Connell popular or how Marianne is rich and Connell poor. She said that Marianne lives in a big house; she showed Connell’s housekeeper mother working for Marianne’s family a few times. That’s it, and Rooney could just as easily have made them the same level of popular and of the same class.I was continually confused about, or forgot, most of the secondary characters because none have distinguishing features or much, if anything, to do. Marianne’s mother isn’t shown, just talked about matter-of-factly a few times. A cruel brother pops up here and there to dole out cruelty, then disappears. A boyfriend is callous and doesn’t stick around long enough to do anything interesting. A sub-plot about abuse is mildly intriguing, but it’s also arbitrary and ends in a flash. They all tease, hinting atNormal People’s unrealized potential to be phenomenal.Of course normal people have lives that can change drastically and in unpredictable and sad ways, but translating that to the page necessitates a concrete story arc. I understand why some critics have called this book “stream-of-consciousness.” Rooney didn’t employ thatwriting technique, but the events, jumping as they do from one disconnected thing to the next, flashing backward and forward confusingly, are stream-of-consciousness in plot form. As a writing style, stream-of-consciousness is horrible, but in plot form it’s disastrous. I’ll give Rooney another try withConversations with Friendsbut with the lowest expectations.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Sally Rooney is the real dealNormal Peoplehas been lavished with praise from critics, longlisted for the Man Booker prize andadapted for television by the BBC. And that\'s just in its first week of publication!All that attention will, no doubt, attract quite a few readers who would not ordinarily touch this subject with a barge pole. Because this book:A)\tIs about young peopleB)\tIs a love story (but not a \'romance novel\')C)\tContains a fair bit of sex (which is crucial to the storytelling, btw, and is not graphic)All of which (possibly also the fact that the author is a 27-year-old woman) means thatNormal Peoplewill inevitably be dismissed by some as frivolous. It isn’t. This is a confident, accomplished and serious work.Of Rooney’s debut,Conversations with Friends, I said in my review it ‘occasionally scrapes close to the bone’. Well,Normal Peoplecuts to the core.Normal Peopleis not out to inspire, instruct, entertain or talk down to anyone, which makes it something of a refreshing anomaly in current fiction about young people. It is a novel (for anyone, young or old) that simply presents the truth of youthful experiences without the filters of nostalgia or sentimentality. It invites you to inhabit the psyche of someone else – two someone elses: Connell and Marianne – to identify with them and to feel their pain and turmoil. For the reader who connects to that, it is wracking.The story focuses only on the pivotal moments for these two characters, jumping forward three weeks, six months, or five minutes, as needed, to excise all the uneventful bits of life and leave us with the most emotionally intense supercut possible. It follows them from high school in a small town, through their years at university in Dublin, as the dynamic between them shifts with their surroundings and social circle. They’re not officially \'together\' the whole time, or even most of the time, but they always figure in each other’s lives in a significant way.Sally Rooney writes with such precision that this all feels painfully true. She conjures the tension and emotion in a scene just from the way someone wrings out a dish sponge; she conveys the full weight of feeling from a look or a shrug. In Rooney’s imagining, Connell and Marianne as separate entities are less important than the interplay between them – their relationship dynamic and the influence each of them has on shaping the other, that’s the real stuff of this book:""How strange to feel herself so completely under the control of another person, but also how ordinary. No one can be independent of other people completely, so why not give up the attempt, she thought, go running in the other direction, depend on people for everything, allow them to depend on you, why not.""There’s irony here, and self-conscious posturing (though not nearly as much as in CWF), but earnestness, truth and kindness as well. In addition to the central relationship are issues of class and intellectual integrity. It\'s a particularly astute look at the rebuild of self that teenagers undergo in the transition from school to uni, how it allows some to thrive while others stumble, and in some ways is just an illusion after all.So there’s hype and there’s backlash to the hype, andNormal Peopleis sure to resonate powerfully with some readers and not at all for others. If you like a minutely observed novel about people and feelings that isn’t mawkish, I\'d say give it a go.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""On the second page of Sally Rooney’s universally acclaimed, Booker- longlisted novel is the following paragraph:‘He puts his hands in his pockets and suppresses an irritable sigh, but suppresses it with an audible intake of breath, so that it still sounds like a sigh.’What?I get the hand in the pockets bit, but how the hell does the rest of it work? A sigh is an exhalation and I have no idea how any attempt to suppress a sigh by inhaling could possibly sound like one. I’ve tried hard to imagine it, but no luck. I’ve tried even harder to do it, but even less luck. In fact, in an effort to understand this twaddle I have tried it so often that I have come close on several occasions to hyperventilating and passing out.What have those Faber editors been doing? Maybe they have no problem with it because they are all so much cleverer than me and know how to read properly. Or maybe they also tried to do it and actually did pass out, which might explain why they have failed to apply the editorial pencil with any intelligence in the 264 pages that follow.The more likely explanation, of course, is that the problem is mine – and I offer the following gems from Normal People on that understanding…• ‘He looks down into his lap, and exhales quickly, almost like a cough’.It’s hyperventilation time again. I’ve imagined it and I’ve tried it, but I still don’t get it.• ‘He can’t even visually imagine himself as a lawyer, wearing a tie and so on..’Do we really need that ‘visually’?• ‘It’s true she is Connell’s type, maybe even the originary model of the type:’Originary? What does that mean? Am I the only one who had to look it up? (It’s not in Chambers, by the way, so you’ll need the OED)• ‘Peggy, watching, took a performatively large mouthful of Cointreau…’Can anyone explain what ‘performatively large’ actually means?• ‘Enraged now, Alan wrenched her back from the sink by her upper arm, and, seemingly spontaneously, spat at her.’Seemingly spontaneously?I could go on. It’s not often that I feel the need to read with a pencil in my hand but Normal People drove me to it, and my copy is now covered with question marks and annotations. I retired from teaching last year but reading Sally Rooney’s feted novel felt like I was marking again - in this case marking the work of a precocious, but overindulged, talent.In 'Normal People' alternating points of view are combined with an inconsistent and confusing authorial presence, voices are often difficult to differentiate in an ineffectual free indirect style, the comma splices (Ferrante this isn’t) and the unpunctuated dialogue, far from creating an impressionistic flow, suggest a lack of precision, and the prose shifts from past to present for no apparent reason and even within paragraphs, creating a chronological blur. In short, it's a bit of a mess.If I cared about the characters or cared about the story, these things would not matter quite so much but on the few occasions when I saw through the writerly mess I found it difficult to care about them at all.The novel, though, has been so well received that its very reception has become a news story. ‘Salinger for the Snapchat generation’: critics unite to praise 27 year-old novelist’ was the headline in last Saturday’s Guardian.So the problem is clearly mine.Maybe I've read a different book from the one everyone is raving about. Maybe I've read the same book but don't know how to read properly. Or it could be that I'm the child's voice at the back of the crowd politely suggesting that the emperor might not be wearing any clothes.""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'I am not sure how to write this review because I seem to be so far beyond the pale on my antipathy to this book. In simplest terms I didn\'t connect with this work at all and I would be best to chalk this up to a ""reader/writer"" mismatch and move on but I will try and articulate some of my reading experience.Some of my perplexity withNormal Peopleis that I just couldn\'t relate to the twenty something, highly educated, politically aware and cynical young adults that populate this novel. I am not sure how reflective these voices are of young Irish making their way in the world, but as presented here I found them exasperating to listen to and not particularly nuanced.It is possible that even if I didn\'t enjoy the novel I might like the writing but in actual fact Rooney\'s style is perhaps the single biggest thing that bugged me. I found some passages of interest sandwiched between a lot of wooden dialogue and these flat descriptions ...Marianne goes inside and comes back out again with another bottle of sparkling wine, and one bottle of red. Niall starts unwrapping the wire on the first bottle and Marianne hands Connell a corkscrew. Peggy starts clearing people\'s plates. Connell unpeels the foil from the top of a bottle as Jamie leans over and says something to Marianne. He sinks the screw into the cork and twists it downwards. Peggy takes his plate away and stacks it with the othersThis kind of writing really gives me nothing.Others have cited the two dimensional nature of her secondary characters and I would concur. Barely any of them made much of an impression on me. Alan - Marianne\'s brother, seemed particularly badly drawn. He appears to be a key part of understanding Marianne and yet he warrants only a few pen-strokes of unexplained malice and cruelty. The opening of a wine-bottle and pouring of cups of tea receives much more page space.I tried to understand Marianne, who seems to be both ugly and beautiful, popular and friendless. Her hinted at troubled family life was suppose to underpin her need to be a submissive. I remain unconvinced that this is really how dominance and submission works and I would think experts in BDSM might strongly take issue with some of the cliches here.The relationship between Marianne and Connell should have kept this book afloat at the very least. The intense emotional and physical connection, the will they / won\'t they stay together, all the drama of YA love is here but it is in an eye-wateringly navel-gazing form. I found it all exactingly po-faced. The number of inexplicable break-ups, largely based on mis-communication was about three or four break-ups too many for me. I just wanted to yell at this novel most of the time. Say what you mean and stop being so insufferably difficult !, either split up or stay together, both your friends and I really don\'t care !. Marianne and Connell were of most interest to me when they started emailing each other, discussing novels and politics thus preventing them breaking up over some new emotional minutiae. Perhaps this should have been a novel of their email exchanges.Oh well, I guess I will never be a Rooney fan and I have doubtless missed the point of this book entirely but that is ok not every book is for every reader.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Normal Peoplestarts out beautifully. Marianne is a loner in high school with no friends, while Connell is the popular football player. His mom works as a cleaner at Marianne's house, so they run into each other when he stops by to pick up his mom. Over time, they start to thaw around each other, growing closer as they realize that they can be their true selves when they are together.Rooney captures so well the vulnerability and awkwardness of teenage years, along with its exuberance and infinite possibility. It was sweet to follow along to Marianne and Cornell's developing relationship. Even though there is the stress of school and the pressure of being teenagers, when they are alone together, they can be free to express themselves and be who they really are.Then they are off to college, and the dynamics change. Marianne becomes the popular one, and Connell becomes the loner with no friends. At this point, I start to realize Rooney captures a very black and white version of high school and college. You are either part of the popular obnoxious crowd or you are a nobody with no friends, and there is nothing in between. And everyone's ultimate goal was to be in the popular crowd. But that isn't the school experience I remember, so it became harder and harder for me to connect with this book. In my experience, people had several different groups of friends, and no one liked obnoxious people. Most were working so hard that they didn't have time to worry about popularity and how others regarded them, especially in college.This story has a very YA feel to it, where the characters are filled with angst and lack emotional maturity. While that made sense when Marianne and Connell were in high school, as the story progressed through their college years, it didn't anymore. The two seem to love each other, and yet, they are so sensitive to perceived slights that innocent conversations would quickly escalate to a breakup. Honest communication would clear this up immediately, but they don't do that. Instead, they circle and prod each other until they are back together again. Then the cycle repeats. It's all very dramatic, but it left me pretty apathetic by the end of the book.This book also tackles the subject of abuse, but I think it was a missed opportunity here. Rooney portrays abuse as if some people just want to be abused, so they will let anyone abuse them, and even go around looking for it until they find it. That's not right. Victims have trouble escaping because abusers are often the people they love most, who treat them well most of the time and express regret after an incident. But there is no love or good treatment in this book, so it doesn't make sense that the victim would just put up with it.In the end, I thought the first half of this book was wonderful, but everything stagnated in the second half. The main characters never really grew up, so they repeated the same mistakes over and over again. Their lack of maturity and insight into themselves and their relationships grated on me. I went into this book with really high hopes, but ultimately it didn't live up to its potential.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Man booker prize long list nominee and Costa book awards nominee This is a book that has many admirers and sadly it didn\'t work for me and while I would love to agree with all the judges on this one I only struggled to the end because it was a bookclub read.

Marianne and Connell ended up bein together but Connell didn\'t want anyone to know because it would affect his social standing. *roll eyes*… I mean seriously.....

They did amazing job by adapting this lyrical, poignant, sad and realistic story with remarkable, heartfelt performances! It is a real soul crusher, heartbreaker! Get ready to set your ugly cries free!!!!This really reminded me of those tear jerkers, Oh God I cannot breathe, all my happiness swept away by emotional vampires vacuum cleaners inc., come on, that’s kind of nerve bending story that one of the protagonist has to die from a deadly disease ( or both of them needed to die sometimes! Oh no another crying torrent coming up! I cannot hold it! I can’t)or one of them has to commit suicide kind of, depressive, sad, exhausting, giving you anxiety attacks kind of John Green books. (After looking for Alaska, I felt the a dark cloud always following me for one month and my husband fed me with soap and Chardonnay, as you can imagine I couldn’t eat solid food at least two months because I bit the pages of the book and chewed so hard, destroyed my dental implements!!!)So yes this book is sad, horrifyingly bringing your dark clouds and vultures above your head and interesting fact is nobody dies! But yes there are so many heavy, harsh, heart wrenching, brain cell boiling issues make you feel like hit by a truck several times, then suffered from waterboarding and torture conducted by American Psycho’s Patrick Bateman and finally thrown away into the swamp,eaten by crocodiles. The characters deal with drug addiction, bullying, sexual assault, suicidal thoughts, severe depression and it is really heartbreaking to see them not to have a regular teenager lives.And you know what after all those torturous feelings, my kindest part of soul( also my masochist brain cells and my vulnerable heart) loved those two characters, Connell and Marianne and witnessed their literally growing up, their adolescence and early adulthood times, forming friendship, special- sensitive bound. At first when they were in high school, Marianne is outcast, social pariah, bullied by mean girls as Connell is shiny, popular star of the school community. The part he didn’t take her to the prom was harsh, mean move and Connell lost his all his brownie points and earned slapping contest championship’s high rated asshole statue.But when they were in college, the balances were changed now Marianne is intellectual, independent, smart social queen and Connell loses his spotlight and sentenced to be an ordinary, invisible college boy which makes him more depressed and lonely.Their friends-lovers- again friends- again lovers kind of complex relationship and their story’s revelation should be called : “Restrained screams” or “Unsaid Words” , or “Bottled Up Emotions!” or “I think I’m really pissed off those two characters so much for breaking my heart !”I know the realistic conclusion was necessary, logical, reasonable but it doesn’t mean it is not hurting you so much!As a result, if you can deal with feeling blue by reading sad, sad, sad, OH GOD WHY THE HELL I CARED SO MUCH ABOUT THOSE CHARACTERS kind of book, this is just for you.I liked the captivating, realistic, poignant story telling and I truly accepted those broken, flawed, complex characters but I think sometimes their story made me suffocated a little.

I loved how she touches on real issues that young adults experience as they enter a new era of life (college). While reading I kept wondering.. ""Will they even end up together?""

But I think I’ll get away with it, you never see any police around here from one year to the next. Anyway, standards really aren’t what they were, I don’t even think anyone would care. In the old days if you did a summer reading challenge in winter you’d be out the door so fast your feet wouldn’t touch the ground. But these days people have neck tattoos and name their children after brands of paint remover so you can get away with anything.When I looked at the categories of the reading challenge I had to ditch a couple – “Read a Goodreads Choice Winner” was one – I mean, sorry Goodreads, not to eat the hand that feeds you and all but those Choice Awards are not my cup of tea at all. Fortunately the other categories fit neatly on to several stubborn denizens of my real life to be read shelves, so off I go.The category I’m doing here is “Read a ‘most read’ book” so I consulted the list and I found a copy of one of these popular works in my local Oxfam, andNormal Peopleit is.NOT THAT NORMALThis turned out to be a kind of romance but at least it was the unromantic modern version, where we follow a couple from school (she’s rich and unpopular, he’s working class and beloved by all) to university (where it’s the other way round suddenly) and during this long peregrination they’re on-and-off shagging and loving and BFFing and pinging from one thing to the other like pinballs whilst at the same time recoiling in horror from acknowledging the plain fact that they’re made for each other, so they attempt and fail to have actual real boy/girlfriends and the real boy/girlfriends have no idea what’s really going on so this golden couple of Marianne and Connell have a permanent status of IT’S COMPLICATED.They have angst in their pangst.The short version of all that is to say thatNormal Peopleis the unfunny updated version ofWhen Harry Met Sallyor that it’s like if Ross and Rachel had absolutely no sense of humour or any charm at all and were all strictly gloomsville I-am-suffering because life is suffering, woe is us, woe is all of us.THE MASOCHISM TANGOIn the middle of this wall to wall fraughtness and gnashing of laptops we get to find out that the lovely Marianne has a masochistic streak. When she’s not with Connell she likes her boyfriends to beat her up.I think it’s now possible to construct a rough and ready scale of female masochism using novels I happen to have read or movies seen. Here are seven female protagonists rated out of ten on the masochism scaleAnastasia Steele in Fifty Shades of Grey...………………………….3Eileen Dunlop in Eileen......................................................…….4Lee Holloway in Secretary...………………...…………………………...6Marianne Sheridan in Normal People...…………………………….7Nora in Topping from Below\t......……………………......…...……….8Erika Kohut in The Piano Teacher...……………………......………..9O in Story of O...…...…………………………...…………………………….10O is the gold standard of female masochism. I can’t see O ever being beaten.THE WATER FROM THE TAP GOT WARMERThe soundtrack toNormal PeopleI think would be a jarring mixture of Kraftwerk, Leonard Cohen and late Billie Holliday, when her voice was all hoarse and ruined. WhatNormal Peopledoes is to describe at length a hot mess of a relationship in cool, affectless sentences, some of which go way too far with their cool and affectlessnessThe outside door closes and Marianne re-enters the kitchen. She rinses her water glass and leaves it upside down on the draining board.Many pages laterThe water from the tap got warmer and Marianne put the plug in the sink and squeezed a little dish soap onto a sponge.And many pages laterMarianne drank a single cup of black coffee and ordered a croissant which she didn’t finish. Connell had a large ham-and-cheese omelette with two slices of buttered toast, and tea with milk in it.Meanwhile, our tall handsome working class star student Connell suffers from a book-length inarticulacy that is distressing to witness. He’s all “that was weird”, “I don’t know”, “I’ll have to think about it”, “Kind of” and “That was weird”.As regards the plot, there’s not much to see here, it’s really just beads on a string. One thing - I had a problem with Marianne’s family, only a mother and a brother, but they both seem to hate her, for reasons never explained. I mean, give us a hint, Sally. Just a little hint. But you know what, I read this in two big gulps, it was weirdly compelling, similar to another much beloved and not that great campus novelThe Secret History. So that’s something. I read many novels that I find extremely putdownable and unpickupable. This was not one of those.SO, DID YOU LIKE IT?It’s complicated.2.5 stars.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '‘Life offers up these moments of joy despite everything.’The directions our lives take are often shaped by those around us, particularly actions made out of love. Normal People, the second novel by the acclaimed writer Sally Rooney, is a moving narrative of the steps and missteps of young love as two people grow into themselves in a troubled world of class divide and social pressures. The book follows Connell and Marriane from their first days as secret lovers in high school through their tumultuous friendship--often sexual--at Trinity College, Dublin. Normal People is at its best when addressing the social issues of class, which she brilliantly uses sex as a medium to elaborate on the power dynamics and dehumanizations of capitalism. While there are a few problematic moments regarding Marianne’s preference towards submission that seems to disregard her autonomy in her own sexuality and assume that the preference is the hallmark of being “damaged”, Rooney manages to very accurately describe modern love in a way that expresses the complexities in all their untidy beauty, as well as the social posturing and emotions of college years. Through using sex as a navigational device across society and told in a sparse, matter-of-fact style that doesn’t impose an authorial judgement over the events in favor of acknowledging the reader’s ability in being able to decode for themselves, Normal People is a success that is nearly impossible to put down.Great news, Rooney more that lives up to the hype. The press releases marketed Irish writer Sally Rooney as the “first great millennial novelist”--a fairly eye-rolling label clearly intended to hit nerves and spark conversation in what also seems a constant attempt from the gatekeepers of older generations to minimize or infantilize the millennial generation--and her name has achieved pop-culture accolades recalling Elena Ferrante from a few years ago. Even Taylor Swift recently came out of the woods to recommend Rooney’s first novel,Conversations with Friends. Speaking of eye-rolling marketing, Conversations was hailed as the “Salinger of the Snapchat Generation,” which seems like something impossible to proclaim unironically. In all this misguided and lazy-label hype that seems half intent on wishing for her downfall, Rooney is an utter delight to read and Normal People is a wonderful achievement. If she is a ""Salinger of Snapchat""? That is up to you to decide (personally I hate that label too much to make a judgement call), but isNormal Peoplean original and insightful accomplishment? Definitely.Normal People begins with Connell and Marianne in high school as what seems like caricatures of themselves. If initially their characters feel a touch cliche, it is because we are all a bit of a cliche at that age. Connell is the smart, athletic type concerned how others think on him whereas Marianne is an outcast who is considered strange for daring to be an intellectual woman and not caring what others think of her (okay, maybe it is alittleoverly cliche, but bear with me here). After a secret relationship--Connell being concerned his friends will know they are sleeping together in a way that is outright abusive--they part ways only to reunite at Trinity College where now Connell is the quiet outsider and Marianne the center of attention. A turning of the tables he deserves as in high school he had a sense his social status made him too good for her and he deeply hurt her because of it as ‘his attraction to her felt terrifying, like an oncoming train, and he threw her under it’. The novel launches from here into many turnings-of-the-table, complicated friendships and near-misses, with each seemingly caught in each others gravity no matter what they do or who they are with.‘It\'s funny the decisions you make because you like someone, he says, and then your whole life is different. I think we\'re at that weird age where life can change a lot from small decisions.’It is truly moving seeing the ways a person’s trajectory in life can be so shaped by those around them. Being set at the start of this decade, the artifacts of the era--such as a scene discussing economic policy while listening to the first Vampire Weekend album--were deeply nostalgic for me and reminded me what life was like in the age of the characters. While some might decry them as overdramatic or bold representations of themselves, remembering who you were at the age of 19 and all the social posturing of that period is a good way to really appreciate how well Rooney captures the age frame of her characters. The social dynamics of a college campus are really well done. Marianne, for example, is honestly interested and invested in social justice and politics, but a girlfriend of Connell’s assumes her discussions about it at parties as a grab for attention. Connell, on the other hand, is very well read but doesn’t name drop books the way others do and is suspected of being uncultured and dumb by Marianne’s male make-a-show-of-being-cultured friends (you know the type: the guy that will tell you information about Ian Curtis without you asking, corrects someone’s pronunciation of Sarte, and casually leaves work-in-progress art lying around but acts annoyed if you comment on it, as a friend recently put it).He did gradually start to wonder why all their classroom discussions were so abstract and lacking in textual detail, and eventually he realised that most people were not actually doing the reading. They were coming into college every day to have heated debates about books they had not read.The society at the Uni is very much indicative of social class, Connell at one point telling his therapist he has actually witnessed students argue over which of their father’s make more money. Being a working class outsider, or a ‘culchie’ as the slang goes, he observes that many of the excessively rich students like the notoriety of intelligence more than actually having tobeintelligent.It was culture as class performance, literature fetishised for its ability to take educated people on false emotional journeys, so that they might afterwards feel superior to the uneducated people whose emotional journeys they liked to read about.It becomes an act of superiority to state you’ve read a book or have a stern opinion on a political topic, which, actually having a working knowledge of these and caring about them does give Marianne an easy “in” with this culture and luckily Rooney spares the reader an impression of C & M as authentic and the rest as Salinger “phoneys”. It’s implied, but handled well.While Rooney occasionally dips into caricatures of college-types for minor characters, her primary characters are nuanced and complex in a way that, by the end of the book, you feel you shared your time with real people. Both Marianne and Connell are problematic at times--especially Connell and his sexual hangups or his impressions of Marianne as “damaged”--but Rooney invests emotional insights into them that grants them a real sense of authenticity. Unlike the first person narration ofConversations,Normal Peopleis told from a very unaffected third-person omniscient perspective that refrains from making judgements on the characters. You see their faults and their inner-justifications or griefs but the reader is left on their own to decide what to make of them. There are times when either character will disgust or frustrate you, and others when you really feel for them. Like life, nothing caught in a social web is simple. As the novel progresses, so does the insight into their emotional well-being, which reaches a climax of sorts when Connell is having suicidal thoughts and Marianne feels insignificant in the world. Luckily, Rooney handles these topics with grace that captures the feelings of depression without glorifying them or using them merely as a plot device. Similarly is Marianne’s homelife, with a now-dead abusive father, an all-but-absent mother and a weak yet abusive older brother who takes out his anger on her. The way these elements shape a person is done quite well--aside from some of Rooney’s presentation of sexual dominance to be discussed shortly--and the impact that people have on each other’s growth and identity is shown as both a sadness and a joy throughout the novel.‘That’s money, the substance that makes the world real. There’s something so corrupt and sexy about it.’It is easy to get invested in the non-relationship of Marianne and Connell, which really pulls the novel forward through authentic raw emotion, but what really makes the novel work is the ways their relationship, and sex, becomes an avenue to examine power dynamics. What is particularly interesting about Marianne and Connell are their particular social classes and how these shape the way they interact with their world.He and Marianne never talked about money. They had never talked, for example, about the fact that her mother paid his mother money to scrub their floors and hang their laundry, or about the fact that this money circulated indirectly to Connell, who spent it, as often as not, on Marianne.While the two rarely discuss money, the influences of late capitalism are very much a part of their identities. Marianne stays on in Dublin and never has to work whereas Connell spends his weekends back home working in a garage and he is looked down upon at Trinity by his peers due to his working class status. It even causes a “breakup” between him and Marianne after their first year when his pride in not asking her to stay at her place since he cannot afford rent is seen by her as him wanting to go home to see other people and disguising it as not having the money to stay in Dublin for the summer. To her the idea of simply not being able to pay rent seems like an aberration from reality. When they are both awarded a scholarship, Connell is irked that for him it is a necessity to fund school but for Marianne it is just a status symbol (and her being awarded the money means a student who actually needed it was denied the money). It is then pointed out to Connell that he is accepting being served dinner at the award ceremony by his own working class peers, essentially throwing guilt back at him as a working-class traitor. This is a typical knee-jerk reaction of a dominant class, repositioning guilt to create in-fighting within the subordinate classes as the dominant class continues on unimpeded.Guilt manifests itself in many ways throughout the novel. Self-doubt and shame enter into many of the characters in the later portion of the novel and there is even a suicide of a character Connell remembers most as someone who built their personality out of trying to be accepted by others. The social posturing and societal guilt that drives it becomes toxic at a point. Most pronounced is Marianne’s self-guilt and the ways her history of trauma still keeps her in it’s grasp:Denise decided a long time ago that it is acceptable for men to use aggression towards Marianne as a way of expressing themselves. As a child, Marianne resisted, but now she simply detaches, as if it isn\'t of any interest to her, which in a way it isn\'t. Denise considers this a symptom of her daughter\'s frigid and unlovable personality. She believes Marianne lacks \'warmth\', by which she means the ability to beg for love from people who hate her.Central to the novel are the sexual growth and identities of Marianne, which Rooney has pegged as a deviant, and Connell who is motivated by privacy, shame and supposed normalcy. Connell views sex as a very private act--he is very flustered when Peggy suggests a threesome with Marianne and Connell--and forces his and Marianne’s relationship to be secret in fear of other’s thinking him abnormal for being with her. He is bothered by her desires for submission and thinks of himself as better than being able to go along with them. As sex is often a metaphor for capitalism in the book, Connell is attempting to be “ethical”, but it is also an issue that he consistently views her prior history and sexuality as constituting abnormality and being “damaged” (as he often puts it). There is a sense of the classic Catholic guilt at play and his revulsion towards her wishes to be hit puts a wedge between them.‘Is the world such an evil place, that love should be indistinguishable from the basest and most abusive forms of violence?’Marianne, as mentioned earlier, tends towards a more devil-may-care attitude towards sex and has a preference for being abused. A major criticism of the book are the ways that submissive preference and being damaged are overly entangled. Using sex as a critique of capitalism, the submissive behavior and those who eagerly dominate over her is an insightful examination of power dynamics, but I do concede the argument that it minimizes the possibility of an aggressive sexual relationship founded on love and mutual understanding instead of only being an avenue for abuse and actual sadists like all the examples in the novel. Moving on. Under capitalism, the female body is inevitably commodified and her dominators tend to see her more as an object to control rather than an equal partner. Her boyfriends are all abusers of power: the first is hosting a fascist to speak on campus, the second is the son of a banker central to causing the economic collapse in Ireland (he also tells stories about his friends working in the US banking industry as if the housing bubble collapse is funny anecdote), and the third is an artist who enjoys photographing torture. It is best stated when the Swedish artist coerces Marianne into being tied up more, ignoring her pleas to stop by telling her he knows she’ll do it because she loves him and he loves her. She wonders ‘Could he really do the gruesome things he does to her and believe at the same time he’s acting out of love?’The need to possess her and abuse her is mirrored in the social class aspects of the novel. While the likely-sociopathic Jamie does not physically abuse her outside of bed, his emotional abuse is far worse--much like the way the wealthy class gaslights the lower classes into remaining submissive. Unfortunately, Rooney’s answer to the sexual questions raised by the book are a bit of a let-down compromise that gives masculinity unnecessary applause. At two pivotal moments in the book, Connell stands up to an abuser--one in high school when she is groped and the other at the end when her nose has been broken--by swooping in through a display of being more masculine than the abuser. It feels overly traditional, much like the sexual roles, in a novel that would be better served by pushing limits. The sexual compromise of the two at the end, with Marianne basically submitting to his love and masculinity, feels like a cop-out for an ending that is already far too tidy than it need be.Despite this, the novel registers as a success overall. Rooney leaves the novel on a note of uncertainty, a similar tone that fueled the infectious nature of the novel, which makes up for the overly tidy emotional climax and resolution. It seems inevitable that there will be a miniseries of this with Ed Sheeran\'s Castles on the Hill blasting over a montage of Connell and Marianne--this idea almost makes me want to drop a star, though I won\'t--and while this work is imperfect it achieves what it sets out to do and I very much enjoyed reading it. I couldn\'t put it down to be honest. These characters are easy to care for, the story is engrossing and the undercurrents of themes and social criticisms are well executed. This novel is a serious dose of early romance nostalgia that doesn’t sugar coat anything. The imperfections and complexities of love and identity are what makes this novel function at its best and I will be eagerly awaiting her next book.4.5/5Her eyes fill up with tears again and she closes them. Even in memory she will find this moment unbearably intense, and she\'s aware of this now, while it\'s happening. She has never believed herself fit to be loved by any person. But now she has a new life, of which this is the first moment, and even after many years have passed she will still think: Yes, that was it, the beginning of my life.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I had been influenced by a friend - whom I adore & respect - by her 1 star review.... way before this book started gaining momentum and hit the stores a month ago.This book wasn’t for my friend - but it sure was for me.I’ve own an ‘Advance Reader’s Edition’, of Sally Rooney’s paper copy for a year and a half. It sat on my shelf, unread.Rooney’s first novel “Conversations With Friends”, was wonderful.I admit having a thing for the type of writer Sally Rooney is:*Addicting* thought-provoking reading for me. “Normal People” is contemporary - romantic-tragic - comic - fresh - psychologically sharp - emotional - and very perceptive.Rooney leaves me lingering in her characters. They are flawed and frustrated.I ‘felt’ flawed and frustrated reading it! At times I wanted to scream at the characters - other times my heart just broke.I knew I wanted to read this novel. I even knew it would most likely drive me into my head. ( it did).I’m not sure why I didn’t open it last year.The book-cover alone has that ‘curl-up-and-get- sucked-in- feeling’, to it.And that’s exactly what happened.I COULD NOT STOP READING. ‘Addicted’!I will never doubt my own gut desire again when it comes to a Sally Rooney novel.I’m a fan here to stay.Totally love what she creates.SOMETHING HAS SHIFTED IN ME, too, with respect to romance novels. I can no longer say...“Oh, I don’t read romance novels”... It depends...Heck, “Crime and Punishment”, had romance. Loaded with power and cruelty... but still some romance.“East of Eden”, by John Steinbeck was filled with juicy romance...( destructive force)... but still...lust and romance was present.Helen Hoang’s book, “The Kiss Quotient”, more modern, had romance written all over it. I loved it, too.Laugh at me if you wish...but in the same way that I got hooked on the two main characters, ( Tessa and Hardin), in Anna Todd’s “After Series”.....( also a young author like Sally Rooney)....I was hooked on the relationship’ between Connell and Marianne in “Normal People”.I’m sure that Rooney would not turn this book into a series… but if she did, I’d read it.The electricity and entanglement between this Connell and Marianne - was soooo complex. I wanted to join their conversations about their families—about the way each felt about themselves, and each other.... and all the things that were happening to them.When I finished the last page, my mind continued swimming in thoughts.Most, I was sad to leave them.Soooo many fabulous sentences - page after page. Gorgeous reflective and intimate writing.Sally Rooney is an ‘it’ author for me.LOVED IT!!!! ....Ha... if you can’t tell.I’ll end with one expert:“All these years they’ve been like two little plants sharing the same pot of soil, growing around one another, contorting to make room, taking certain unlikely positions”.'}]"

The funniest creepy book ever written. Did I hear that peoplecriedwhile reading this? I sure hope it was tears of laughter (or pain) because y\'all need to explain.🛑SPOILERS🛑So I got a real important question here.....how is it that main characters always read about the most pressing issues so damn slow? Like are you actually about to tell me this woman,this author, read one chapter of the manuscript per a ....day? She took WEEKS to read 19 bloody chapters. I would binge that shit in an hour. Hell, I bet even Jeremy read it in 3 seconds. But she took her sweet time like the annoying little vermin she is.Immediately I want to express just how much the heroine ruined this whole book for me. Reading from her POV was like taking a knife, exposing every nerve in my body, and pouring vinegar all over them. To be truthful I don\'t even remember her name. Every time it was spelt out, I read it, then instantly like my brain knows self-preservation, it erases the letters as if I never saw them. Loren? Mulan? Rowan? No clue.She kept thirsting for Jeremy, shoving her nose in Verity\'s business, and gatekeeping everything she learned from the hero. I mean I guess his wife did try to kill her children about a million times out of a sick obsession......but that doesn\'t concern you love, put down the manuscript🙂It drove me CRAZY every time Lemon finished a chapter and had to put her two cents in.Oh but she\'s so evil😢, oh but she\'s so callous🙄, she\'s just so horrible😩. like shut the fuck up already, you nosy, home-wrecking ass bitch. I hope you never get a good night\'s sleep again for what you did to my psychotic icon.I find it fitting that the villain and a character that in a sense was meant to be unlikable was my favourite the whole time.Verity really did the most while doing nothing at all.That includes:💅Pretending to be in a vegetative state for months on end💅Opening her eyes ONLY when Leren was watching💅Running around the house like Casper the ghost💅Messing with the TV to scare the shit out of Loren💅Traumatising her son even more than he already was by talking to himSafe to say Lupon was crying, shaking, throwing up from fear < and I mean likeliterally, she did do all three of those at one point or another💀.Whereas usually I\'d be shivering in me timbers right along with the heroine, the horror aspect of this book followed by Wulun\'s dramatic reactions were too fucking funny, it distracted me.I put my hand on the mattress to lift myself up off the floor, but immediately shift backward onto my palms when I catch Verity watching me. Her head is in a different position, turned to the right, her eyes on mine.How I imagined Verity every time she\'d unexpectedly turn her creepy head on the heroine😭😭 Alright I do apologise for that one but come on.... You can tell Verity, that silly goose, was having the time of her life and so was I.my blood runs cold when my eyes are pulled to the figure standing at the top of the stairs. She’s just standing there, watching her husband as his mouth roams over my breast.My entire body stiffens beneath Jeremy.Verity’s fists clench at her sides before she rushes back in the direction of her room.Whoever thinks that letter was real, explain this comedy (which is actually much funnier with context I promise). I washalffully hoping Verity would chase her petrified ass around the house to really seal it in, the traumatisation and future years of therapy that is.So many missed opportunities😔I bet every time she rose from her ""coma"" and gave Lavan another premature heart attack, she giggled like a maniac before carrying on with her bullshit. Really for that reason alone (making Lowyn age 10 years every time she took a breath), Verity will remain my fav.I actually cannot believe Jeremy fell in love with an old, smelly sock of a character that is Lavash after being married to his genius wife. Talk about a downgrade. ONCE AGAIN DID SHE MURDER CHILDREN?? Yes, but at least she wasn\'t creepy. I know many might disagree but I found Louwon way more hair raising. I mean the sleepwalking?? Straight outta a horror movie.He fell asleep while I was in the bathroom, attempting to abort his daughters with a wire hanger.And look.... Verity is pro choice😌💅You must understand that although the suspense was okay and plot twists, even if below average, were at least emotion-inducing.... the romance was the blandest, stalest, dullest, dryest, most flavourless, and uninspiring piece of crap I\'ve ever read. EVER.In fact, I even scrounged up some fan castings for you guys. I had such a clear picture of them in my head, I just had to share<3🥵Jeremy:🥺LumanTheir sex scenes were also about as hot as you\'d expect two pieces of wood humping each other would be.Anywho the ending? We\'re not gonna talk about it. And not even because I was mad or shocked, I simply didn\'t care. Verity carried this book and she was kinda brain dead for 99.9% of it, nothing will change that power.EDIT 08.2022:8 months later and I\'ve decided we\'re gonna talk about the ending. Here\'s a hot take. If I HAD to pick a team, I\'m gonna choose the letter. As we\'ve already established, The FMC was a sleepwalking red flag and MMC wasn\'t any better. Personally being impressed with the author\'s ability to manipulate her readers is one of my favourite feelings, so Jeremy and the Lochness monster turning out to be the real villains would be a phenomenal plot twist...WOULD BEif this book was written better, with smart (but not obvious) foreshadowing. Unfortunately it wasn\'t, so the manuscript being legitimate is a more satisfying thought meanwhile the letter a more infuriating one.all in all:I know it seems like I really hated this book but if you squint a little YOU WILL SEE that I did mention some positive highlights. Like this being a comedy. A+ miss Hoover. Or how Verity was the determined, obsessive psycho of my dreams. And I did actually get sad during one scene (When Jeremy pulled his daughter out of the river).Yuh that\'s about it.EDIT 10.2022:I\'ve read the bonus chapter and I liked it because they are all suffering😍'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""NOTE: This review is based on my personal opinions about this book. Please note, this is in no way an attack to the author. I am not an advocate of hate trains, lets not send hate to anyone.Full Review: Maybe I should stop reading Colleen Hoover, maybe its not these books and it's me. Anyhow, I am thinking the reason I keep coming back is because, her plots are very interesting and the execution always falls flat.OK...where do I even begin with this mess?The story was captivating, probably the best plot I've seen in Colleen Hoover books so far. Everything else sucked. The characters were shallow and convoluted, I tried my best to relate to Lowen, but I disliked her just as much as I dislike Colleen Hoover's other main characters. They all have similar personalities and nothing to offer. Maybe because they sound so righteous but are wrong is many places. All the characters she writes are cookie cutter adult contemporary heroines, wrapped in tragedies and trying to get through life. There is no distinct 'voice' in Hoover's characters and it's a shame because with the plots she sets, the characterization can do better. You know how some things only feel good in theory? But in practicality, they make no sense? That's how CH writes.Speaking of characters, Jeremy was nothing special either. He didn't play much of a role in the book, at least not actively. He was there to serve Verity's storyline and being the love interest. And that's that. He has a personality of a dry leaf and why both Verity and Lowen were obsessed with him...is a question for another day. Jeremy is not enigmatic, he is not mysterious, he is not anything and that's one of my biggest problems in the book. He is just so badly written, when there could have been soooo much Hoover could have done with his character. Why should I care about him?The fact that both main characters thought it was OK to cheat when Jeremy's wife was camatose in the SAME house made things worse. And they constantly try to justify this. Now I know that it was intended and everything but the fact that they showed little to no remorse was enough to make me hate both of them. The book itself does not acknowledge their cheating, there is no retribution, no consequence of their actions - everything is brushed off without thought. When a book has problematic aspects, it's perfectly okay. When these aspects are romanticized and their flaws are not pointed out (as it should be), then we have a problem. With Lowen and Jeremy not acknowledging the fact they cheated, it just sends a wrong message.Verity is supposed to be a psychotic and obsessive wife to Jeremy who had hated her children even before they were born. Again, sounds better in theory. The plotline should give you chills but ends up being cartoonish and cringey. Jeremy being a cement wall with no personality, her obsession made little sense. Still, she is a better 'character' than the other two. CH tried to write a dark character, but honestly with the wattpad-esque writing, there was no impact.I am glad that the author tried something different, and her writing has changed since her first books but that wasn't enough to cover up the bigger holes here. I have already talked about the characters, which were my biggest issue, specially because I prefer good characterisation over good plot. Here are a list of other reasons why Verity sucks.1. It's not an erotica so why were there pages upon pages of repetitive sex scenes? In fact Verity and Jeremy's entire story was just that. It annoyed me because they clouded the story the whole time. The book was 10% story and 90% sex scenes. The publisher should market it as an erotica if that's the case??? Why is this a problem for me? Missed opportunity. Using sex as a tool to fill Verity and Jeremy's storyline is lazy writing, when those scenes could have been used to give Jeremy more personality and explore other aspects of their relationships.2. CH might be a bestseller, but she is TERRIBLE at writing tragedy and trauma. Both are needlessly used as characters back stories and important part of their personalities but treated dismissively. The MC mom died of cancer a month ago and while it's talked about in first two chapters or so, it's forgotten quickly and Lowen in too horny to remember her. The man who died in front of her? No follow up on that trauma, nothing at all. It just served as a way for her to meet Jeremy. Hoover takes these heavy plot points to add drama, but she never treats them well enough. You do not need to shove one traumatic event in vain to add substance. A well-rounded protagonist can be formed without relying on trauma at all. If the purpose was for us to sympathize with Lowen and make her edgy, then obviously this too failed. I am not a fan of authors using trauma porn, where excessively bad events are used to riddle backstories or even current stories. This is also an obvious pattern in CH other books. MC with tragic past, an asshole love interest with equally tragic circumstances = sexy times.Jeremy's daughters died and his wife is in a coma, but his character often showed little to no sadness while there were a lot of paragraphs describing how crushed he was. Guess he too was so horny that it was OK to cheat on his wife. Oh and the solution? Transfer her to a nursing home so he could hook up with Lowen as much as he wants? Bad execution, bad writing, bad everything.The end where he realizes truth about Verity and kind of kills her? It's treated as nothing. No consequence at all? He just goes on to make a lie about the incident and live a life with Lowen...like what the fuck? Where is the PTSD? Where is the follow up trauma or messed up mental health when you become a murderer of your murderous wife?3. THAT ENDING....THAT DAMN ENDING. I said this is in my other reviews as well but the thing I dislike the MOST about the author is her endings. She'sbadat writing them. There was a huge lead up on Verity being NOT comatose and there was the whole creepy thing going on with her but in the end. No psychotic behavior at all? She just opens her eyes and admit she was lying and that's it??? Then she dies??????? Like what was the point in a psychotic character if she was gonna do that??? It all felt so flat??ALSO the letter at the end that makes us doubt if Verity was actually a victim and Jeremy was the villain?? Like no that's not an amazing twist or anything, that's CH trying too hard. This kind of plot twist is overdone, it's a cliche you will find in horror movies or thrillers from early 2000s. I expected better.In a nutshell, I have ISSUES with this book. It could have done better. But this is where Hoover and I part ways. I won't be reading her books anymore.""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Check out my 7 better thriller recs to read instead of Verity on YouTube💖Writing: offensively bad/5 | Plot: nonexistent/5 | Ending: abysmal/5THE PLOTLowen is a struggling writer who gets the opportunity of a lifetime to co-write a series with acclaimed author, Verity Crawford. When she arrives at Verity\'s home to do some research, she comes across a disturbing autobiography revealing the truth about all the tragic events in her life. Should Lowen let Verity\'s ""dreamy"" husband, Jeremy, know wassup? Or just sex him instead? Find out!MY OPINIONNOW LET\'S BUCKLE TF IN BECAUSE IT\'S ABOUT TO BE A ROUGH RIDE (not the sexual kind Verity LOVED).I want to keep this ""short"", but I\'m not sure I have it in me. This book tops Stay Awake and Unmissing by a MILE. I picked this up even though romance isn\'t my thing because I literally cannot log onto Goodreads without seeing a Colleen Hoover book. So I had to find out for myself, and I certainly did, and as they say... curiosity killed the cat.OK. SO LET\'S GET INTO IT.- Lowen was unnecessary. Literally this whole story could be told without her POV. You could\'ve just had the diary entries as a POV, with Jeremy struggling in real life, and then BAM that ""twist"" at the end. Not only was she unnecessary, but she was ANNOYING. BIG pick me energy. So you thought Amos choking you was rock bottom but you sexing a comatose woman\'s husband in her marital bed was chill? Ight. And honestly her whole sleepwalking story to create empathy in the reader was garbagio.- The writing was appallingly bad. This was BEYOND closed caption ass writing. Even a blind person didn\'t need this much detail. Did we need to know that Verity\'s writing software of choice is Microsoft word? No. Did we need to know that Lowen picked up her drink, took it to the stove, filled her bowl was spaghetti, reheated it in the microwave, then went to the fridge to grab a glass of water before sitting down at the dining room table? NO. But yet we do.- The gratuitous sex was literally like being in a 14 yo boy\'s wet dream. DISGUSTING. I literally skipped PAGES and PAGES of sex. What in the 50 shades of gross is this? How did it add to the story? If you\'re horny, there\'s p0rn. PLZ. We don\'t need this in a ""thriller."" ALSO. The whole ""oh I was just exaggerating for the sake of it"" doesn\'t hold up WHEN YOUR OTHER CHARACTERS ARE LITERALLY SEXING IN THE EXACT WAY YOU DEPICTED IT IN THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY SO???????- Jeremy had the personality of a wet cardboard box. Legit how did ANYONE fall in love with the man when he said/did nothing of substance. This is what they call dickmatized. Free my ladies.- Also, also... this book did no favours for writers tbh. Saying shit like ""I write suspense novels, of course I know about your girlfriend"" doesn\'t make any sense???? I\'m not like WOW HER BRAIN, I\'m like... wow.... is her brain ok? What is the correlation?I\'M ABOUT TO WRITE SOME SPOILERS SO SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM IF YOU HAVEN\'T READ THIS BOOK- Plot holes? Nah, plot CRATERS. How did she fake the brain scans? Why didn\'t Jeremy just kill her when she came home from the hospital? (maybe I missed something?) Girl is up at night sneaking around opening bank accounts but can\'t reach out to a friend and be like HALP??? And don\'t use this whole autobiography as the reason, because your publisher could corroborate your story and you\'re telling me you never discussed it with her afterward????- The letter at the end was atrocious. A perfect example of when authors try to hand-hold the reader through the twist to make sure it lands. I didn\'t need a perfect play-by-play of what your pretending ass was up to in a letter. I gleaned it from you just saying ""SIKE I WAS FAKING.""- Lowen ""forgiving"" or ""justifying"" Jeremy\'s double murder attempts was brutal. C\'mon. Not during women\'s history month.PROS AND CONSPros: I finished thisCons: I read this___Check out my YouTube'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Me, rollerblading into my therapist’s office with heart-shaped sunglasses and a piña colada and dropping this book on the desk with a loud thud:Boy do we have much to talk about today!Why readVeritywhen you can just pull out an Ouija board and summon a demon from hell? I'm sure it’ll have the same effect. I finished this book feeling completely sapped of life, as if I've been bleeding freely for the past few hours instead of simply reading. That ending. What the hell. If I could just shake my head to dissolve the memory of it, to disarrange it somehow, I would. Because of all the things I’d braced myself for,thatwas not it.Right. Let's talk plot.Lowen Ashleigh is set free from the long tedium of her daily life when she’s employed by Jeremy Crawford to ghostwrite the remaining books in a popular series his wife, Verity, is unable to finish due to an unfortunate accident. Lowe acquiesces in the spirit of hope: that this opportunity would help her acquire some small measure of celebrity and that celebrity would be oxygen to the fire of her career. But nothing prepares Lowe for Verity’s autobiography, which she accidentally stumbles upon one day. For the horror of it. Verity’s secrets paint a different picture of what Lowen thought she knew of Verity, Jeremy, and their lives together. But sooner or later, as these things often go, the whole truth will spill, and the fraught waiting in-between would come to an end, with havoc and screaming and loss.“After all, this is a house full of Chronics. The next tragedy is already long overdue.”I love books that make me backtrack my own declarations of preference. The books that catch me completely off-guard, astonish me, keep me on my toes.Verityis not at all what I expected, and I think it is all the better for it.I picked it up with a great deal of skepticism. I did not enjoy any of Hoover's previous work, and didn't think Verity would tip the scales. I’ve never been happier to be so wrong because this book absolutely lives up to the buzz.Verityis a huge departure from Hoover's catalogue. It's a fiendishly clever, mind-bending whirligig\xa0of a book. The plot is a hall of mirrors where everything is a vacant reflection, including the people who live there. Hoover draws you\xa0into a world where illusion informs reality, and time enfolds hauntingly. She lures and tricks and wrong-foots. Always, she wields her unreliable characters to stunning effect: confounding, disturbing and delighting in turn. Not only is nothing what it seems, it’s not even what it seems after it’s been revealed to be not what it seems. And I was entrapped in this story long before I even realized the net was already cast.The book's biggest triumph to me was the sheer energy threaded the pages, how it feels uncontrollable, yet it is perfectly under control by the author. I like the way Hoover makes you feel Lowe’s deep-skin unease and confusion as if it's your own. You can sense the danger pulsing all around, and while you can scarcely see the freshly hideous future taking shape ahead, you can feel it all the same. In short, if I were Lowe, I’d have gotten thehellout of there. I’d have been impressed by her courage if I weren’t too preoccupied repeating a litany of “GET OUT OF THERE, YOU IDIOT” in my head.And,oh my God, the ending. That shit struck me backhanded. I'm still reverberating from it. Because here's the thing:Verityoffers its reader no solidity of truth that they could hold in their hands. Even as I was reading and rereading the last chapter I was mining it for clues, trying to make sense of something that felt so utterly senseless. Everything I’ve read up until that point felt like a false memory and I was left shaking my fist at the whole book for leaving me on such a hideous note as it did. Because,what.So, yeah. I'm going to let this story haunt me for a long time.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Bold. Unrelenting. All-consuming. Creepy. Unputdownable.What I’ve come to appreciate most aboutColleen Hoover’s work—whether it’s an emotionally charged love storyorin this case, her first go at suspense—is her penchant for pushing boundaries. For telling theunexpectedstory.“It’s got bad things in it. Bad words, bad people, bad scenes.”Hoover preemptedVerity’s release with a warning of sorts—although facetious and comical in delivery, it’s something sensitive readers should take to heart. This storyline isdark, and the lives of the characters that inhabit the pages are far from perfect—so, don’t kid yourself into thinking this is something it’snot.Verityis horrifying, maddening, and what-the-hell-inducing, but it’s also sustenance for that bibliophile looking to satisfy a craving for somethingdifferent.From chapter one, it’s blatantly obviousthiscomes from an entirely different side of Hoover’s psyche than her typical love stories. Blood spatter accompanies the all-consuming, addictive quality of her words. Storytelling with the power to crawl inside of your mind, take over, and demand your undivided attention.Lowen’s life is literally in shambles—her mom just passed, she’s broke, on the brink of eviction and even though she’s a talented author, the crippling anxiety involved with marketing herself to fans has made her work less than popular.It’s the opportunity of a lifetime that uproots Lowen from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan to the quiet Vermont countryside. Contracted by a publisher to ghostwrite the three remaining books in an uber-popular series after the author was involved in an accident, Lowen has a ton of work ahead. Research lands her in Verity Crawford’s home office, looking for anything that might indicate the direction the author wanted to take the series. Instead, she finds herself caught-up in Verity’s life. Living in her home, sleeping in her bed, and spending time with Verity's husband, Jeremy, and their young son. Inescapable is the grief and pain marring it all.Most surprising was the level of creepiness Hoover managed to incite. A level even some seasoned suspense writers fail to attain. From someone who reads in the genre consistently and watches horror, it’s quite the feat for me to feel this level of anxiety. For my stomach to be twisted in knots, in anticipation of what’s to come—but, it happened.And that finale . . .stunning. I was so sure I’d pinpointed exactly what was happening andwhy, but I was wrong. So very wrong.Hoover mentions in herAcknowledgementsthat this was an indie project she wanted to branch out and write on her own, which is commendable and exciting when you think about where her inner drive might take readers next. While there’s no denying her love stories are fierce, my hope is formoresuspense. To be this taken with her first try, I can only imagine what that mind of hers might dream up next.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '""Find what you love and let it kill you.""-Charles BukowskiWoah, this wasfuuuucked up. It should really come with a warning:do not start reading this at night if you want to sleep.For two reasons, actually. One, it is so compulsively readable that it\'s almost impossible to put it down until you\'ve finished it. And two, it is seriously creepy and disturbing. Warnings for depictions of child abuse and some graphic violence.Perhaps this doesn\'t need to be said, butVerityis definitely not a regular Colleen Hoover romance. There\'s a love story, and sex, but it is predominantly a creepy thriller. And a mindfuck, if we\'re being honest.Verityis mainly about three people - struggling author Lowen Ashleigh, a man called Jeremy Crawford, and Jeremy\'s wife, Verity, who was recently left incapacitated by a car accident. Verity is a successful writer, but she is no longer able to continue her bestselling series. That\'s why Lowen is brought in to complete the remaining three books. To do so, she stays at the couple\'s house so she can go through Verity\'s notes.But Lowen finds something else in Verity\'s office. An unfinished autobiography. As she reads, her fear grows. Lowen begins to dig into dark truths about the family and the deaths of their twin daughters. At the same time, she finds herself falling for Jeremy and wondering if perhaps she should reveal the truth to him.I don\'t want to say too much,but I thought it was excellent. Hoover expertly leads us on a winding trail of lies and manipulation. As the story is essentially Hoover - an author - writing about an author reading about another author, there\'s this constant sense that someone is lying to you-- but who is it? Now, that\'s not so easy to tell.I was good at spewing bullshit. It’s why I became a writer.This may seem like a bit of a backhanded compliment, but I think I enjoy Hoover’s fucked-up books so much because I usually find her regular romances kinda fucked up.I like her books so much more when she\'s writing about trauma and morally-questionable charactersthan when she\'s trying to sell me a douche as a love interest.It\'s a clever book, and I don\'t simply mean because of its twists and turns. It\'s clever because of the fear and uncertainty the author creates. That all three authors create. The aptly-namedVerityis a novel about fictions and truths, about authors and characters, and about how it can sometimes be hard to separate the two.I found it absolutely riveting.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I will never look at Steak n’ Shake the same way……Colleen Hoover and Lisa of Troy finally meet. Alright that’s weird. I am never referring to myself in the third person again….So what’s the scoop on Verity?In Verity, we find Lowen Ashleigh who is a down-on-her-luck author when she gets an incredible offer to finish a series by a famous author, Verity Crawford. When Lowen goes through Verity’s office, she discovers an autobiography by Verity with salacious admissions and jaw-dropping tales. What will Lowen do with the information she has discovered?This is my very first Colleen Hoover work so I will share with you my general impressions, not sure if these are hallmarks of her other books. Hoover keeps the action flowing with short paragraphs and sentences. There are no page long paragraphs here.The storytelling is top notch with gossipy revelations sprinkled throughout the book. This book is filled with steam. Steam upon steam. Steamy steam. Descriptions of steamy steam. However, please be warned that this book is incredibly, incredibly dark with some graphic depictions of child abuse.In terms of structure, Verity really reminded me of the book, Home Before Dark by Riley Sager, because it would also switch back and forth between modern day and back to an old book. The main character, Lowen, does have internal ruminations, but the author masterfully navigated these sections and did not get lost in the weeds.Verity is page-turning and reading it is certainly not a chore.There are two things that kind of bothered me, but with me, storytelling is everything. And this book had it in spades.First, the ending did not surprise me at all. Without trying to spoil anything, the ending relies on a familiar trope that I saw coming very early in the book.Second, a part of the ending did not make sense. Again, I don’t want to spoil anything, but it has to do with a certain reaction to the manuscript.Personally, if I was the editor of this book, I would have rewritten the ending, but (sadly) Colleen Hoover has not been ringing my phone off the hook.Overall, Verity is a dark, page-turning tale, and I look forward to reading more from Colleen Hoover. Highly recommended for those who are fans of May Cobb.

I chose to read this piece of nonsense based on the myriad 5-star reviews on Amazon—I’m talking HUNDREDS. Now there are two reasons this novel may have so much positive feedback. First, it could be that there are hundreds of readers who don’t often step beyond this author’s normal genre (of which this book did not belong) and are simply ride-or-die fans. Second, it could be that I’ve gone round the twist and am missing the value. I’m betting on the former.The writing here is, admittedly, pretty amazing. Character development and plot movement, as well as the establishment of tone, is all done masterfully. What is ludicrous, however, is the plot itself.**SPOILER ALERT AHEAD** Verity is a well-known and well liked author with a huge fan base. She and her husband lose their young twin girls some months apart in separate tragedies, then Verity herself is in a car accident. The accident leaves her in a semi-vegetative state, unable to move or communicate. Her husband seeks to hire an author to finish the last three books his wife had promised as part of a series of nine. In steps Lowen, a talented author in her own right, though certainly not as famous as Verity. She travels to the couple’s home, where Verity is under constant care (fed, diapered, etc.), in order to look over the woman’s notes in preparation for the writing Lowen has been commissioned to complete. Whilst rummaging through Verity’s office, and falling in love with Verity’s husband, Lowen discovers a manuscript that is supposedly an autobiography written by Verity before her accident. It is beyond disturbing and paints the now comatose author as a raging psychopath who despised her twins, feeling only raging jealousy at the attention they garner from their father. So far so good, right? Here’s where it all goes to hell. VERITY IS FAKING HER INJURIES. Really? Doctors and nurses, specialists in their respective fields, can’t tell SHE IS FAKING IT?? For MONTHS? She has been cleaned, turned and fed and NO ONE KNEW? Additionally, we are to believe that she wrote the most disturbing things about herself and her children and labeled the manuscript an autobiography as a WRITING EXERCISE? What woman writes that she tried to abort her own children with a coat hanger as part of an exercise?? I could go on and on but I think you get the picture. Absurd is the only word that adequately conveys the entire premise.I wish someone, anyone, would have said to this author, “hey, you’re damn good, but this story just doesn’t make an iota of sense.” I’m left wishing back the hours it took me to read this insanely ridiculous drivel.

It is so unique, so completely shocking that it blows away every other suspense story I've ever read.Lowen is a struggling writer when she gets an offer too good to pass up. Jeremy, the husband of successful author Verity Crawford, hires Lowen to complete Verity's series when his injured wife is unable to do so. Once Lowen arrives at their home to start compiling notes and do research, she discovers an unfinished manuscript that looks to be Verity's autobiography. What is written in those pages will horrify and haunt anyone who reads it.So many books advertise as suspenseful thrillers, but hardly any of them cause my heart to blip even a little. (I know, I'm a stone cold reader.) But this book! There is such a deliciously creepy atmosphere that permeates throughout and it got me good. I'll admit to heart palpitations, cold clammy hands, and being startled at the smallest noises. And as the story progresses and we find out more and more, the tension ratchets up to almost unbearable levels.There was never any hope for me. I was hooked from the very first page. There is a creativity to this story that makes it hard to look away. I've never read anything like this, not even close. As a result, every page was a surprise and I just wanted to keep going. And as the truth gets darker and more tortuous, I had no choice but to hold on for the ride of my life.This book employs one of my favorite formats, a story within a story. I've loved pretty much every book I've come across that uses this format, and it works especially well here. The interspersing of the inner manuscript with the outer story allows us to find out what's going on at the same time that Lowen is figuring things out.I cannot believe this is Colleen Hoover's first thriller. Reading this feels like watching a master at their craft, setting the bar higher than I ever thought possible. This story is so astonishing and unsettling and completely original.

The varying between Low\'s present tense POV and the chapters featuring Verity\'s autobiography built the most exquisite tension, and by the end of the novel we are flipping pages as quickly as Low is, trying to decipher where this is going and what\'s going to happen. Also, that epilogue. That is all I will say, other than I\'m respectful and grateful to CoHo for leaving this book without the neat wrapping and shiny bow. There are pieces of the story that are essentially left up to the reader to determine their thoughts on, and while a bloody and gruesome story, this will make a fabulous book club novel with copious discussion points. Highly recommended if you can stomach the content, but beware reader-once you pick it up, you certainly won\'t want to set it down until you turn the final page.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Have you ever finished a book and thought… WTF did I just read?Verityis one of those books that will do that to you. Word to the wise for CoHo fans: this is not your typical book from Colleen Hoover. It’s amazingly written and it’s a completely captivating read, but it’s so different from anything she’s ever put out before.“Some families are lucky enough to never experience a single tragedy. But then there are those families that seem to have tragedies waiting on the back burner. What can go wrong, goes wrong. And then gets worse.”Verityis a complex story about an author who is ghost writing a series for Verity Crawford, an author who is injured in a way she can’t write right now- maybe ever. Her husband, Jeremy, commissions Lowen to do this work. Lowen goes to the Crawford’s house to do some research but that house and that family is more than she ever expected. While searching through old paperwork pertaining to the series Verity has written, she finds a manuscript of a truly messed up autobiography that changes her life and the life of the Crawford family forever.The word I would use to describe this book isdisturbing. I was seriously disturbed the whole time I read. It wasn’t too spooky for me, but it was thrilling and horrifying at times. The writing was out of this world and the story messed with my mind. I’m not sure if I loved it, hated it, liked the characters or hated them. It’s a story that’s not always likable, but dang it was good. It was enthralling and made me think. That ending messed with my mind so bad, I don’t even know how to feel.If you’re a fan of psychological thrillers with romance thrown in and don’t mind a book that’s disturbing and thrilling because it’s also brilliant, check outVerity. I’m glad I went outside the box with this one and read it!!'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '** UNPOPULAR OPINIONThis is the second novel that I\'ve read by the author.\xa0 I\'m not really familiar with her writing or style, but I was seeing many 4-5 star ratings on this book and it was a ""thriller"" so that was enough to push me to give it a try.There are many, many high reviews for the book so I\'m not here to dissuade anyone from reading it.

I never have to say “maybe this weekend I’ll finally read a Colleen Hoover novel” again, because I finally did it. And I won’t be doing it again. Not for me really, but I see why people love this. I’m glad I did read it though because, well, this entire story is an absolute trainwreck and I do love watching a good trainwreck unfold. I mean, it’s entirely overblown to the point of absurdity and all the two main characters are more concerned with sex than the moral implications of…well, literally anything INCLUDING their sexual relations with each other, but damn does this go some places. It is entirely creepy, but also darkly funny once you know the twist because like…WHAT THE FUCK? This is successfully dark and bleak, and one you can\'t stop reading, I\'ll give it that. But like, imagining this from Verity\'s point of view...did she intend this as dark humor? Because wut? Also do people find this sexy? Because I have questions....is it like a Mr Rochester thing? Because this book does seem constructed around Jane Eyre nods in many ways.If you don\'t know the plot: Lowen, a struggling writer, is hired by Jeremy to finish his wife Verity\'s body of work after an accident leaves her unable to finish. Lowen finds an autobiography that reveals all sorts of juicy drama and murders, but decides to just have sex with Jeremy instead of do much about it until she can find a way to ensure Verity\'s story will get him to run away with her instead. Ill-advised, Lowen, ill-advised. Bonus points if you just pretend this is someone finishing Sue Grafton\'s alphabet series. Would have preferred that, honestly.Here\'s a handy guide I made:Its unfortunate that without the narrator in the book it probably would have been a more tense storyline. Lowen is really here just for the sake of sex scenes, and there are many. You know how Murakami can’t let a breast go undescribed? Hoover does that but for cum shots. Of which there are many. But one does not enter a novel like this (gross, why would I put it that way in this context?) for the sake of good writing but for a thrilling plot. Which, I will admit, this has. Albeit poorly constructed—I mean EGREGIOUSLY bad choices are made and nobody seems all that concerned with actually doing anything useful—but it will keep you flipping pages. Mostly to see if hopefully they all fucking die instead of just keep fucking, but whatever. You do you, Lowen and Jeremy. Wouldn’t recommend it, but we’re all grown adults.Seriously though ,so much of this book makes zero fucking sense. Like, I LOVE suspension of disbelief. But COME ON. How’d homegirl fake the brain scans?Also, Lowan is just like wow I have the answers to all sorts of wild shit but I’m only going to read a few sentences of it a day then make a trite comment and get to pantsless time with Verity’s husband. What is the time frame of this book? You are stuck in a house with possible murderers and you’re like NAH I won’t read their tell-all too quickly? But she can’t because apparently she’s gotta keep banging Jeremy, who is also technically her employer but there is no HR so fuck it, fuck. With Verity possibly watching? Christ. Also, wear a condom. Please, I beg you. What part of this tangled and weird situation made anyone think ""hmmm maybe a pregnancy would help?""Everyone is WAY too cool with murder in this too. Verity is a Medea-figure here, one who uses sex as a means of control and ranks how she values Jeremy based on the quantity of sex they are having, so I guess its no surprise she’s down to murder and not give two shits. But then there is also the ending. I wanted to like it. I mean, okay this whole book plays with ideas of duality—the twins as two sides of Verity’s personality, the two possible truths at the end—but Hoover is WAY too eager to walk you through showing to point out how clever it is. She’s practically yelling “VERITY MEANS TRUTH! GET IT?!?!?!?”So yea, this is fun enough I guess? I see the appeal. It’ll make a great movie when it inevitably happens. It could really only be improved upon, like, maybe actors will put some personality into these lifeless characters. The biggest plot hole in this is that two different people were in love with Jeremy, he’s as unlikable and bland as possible. Imagine Lowen having sex with a loaf of stale bread that is as down to kill as it is down to bang. You can now say you’ve read Verity.This is a book for the sake of fun and entertainment and gotta say, I was entertained. I hate everyone, I mean, these characters make Sally Rooney characters seem like wonderful people. To be fair, half the point of this book is to read some steamy sexy times, which there are many, but it sort of becomes annoying when the plot is so engaging. They break for sex again and it’s like NO, STOP, THERE ARE MORE PRESSING ISSUES, I NEED ANSWERS. Children are dead and everyone’s just like hey I’m horny. I get it, we all like sex but damn people. These people would all die in a horror film because the monster would be after them and they’d be like “fancy a quickie?” “Sure, J-bear, why not —— oh no my face is being eaten by this monster!” And Jeremy would be like “HOT.” And try to seduce the monster I guess? I don’t know.Anyways now I can say I wasn’t lying when I told people every day of my life in a bookstore or library for the past year that, sure, I’ll give Hoover a try. Mission accomplished.2/5UpdateSo I read the bonus chapter and I’m not sure who read this and thought “say more!” but apparently enough people did to get a hardcover edition out of it. Yep, still hate everyone in it, probably more now. Low is basically haunted by Verity and some of it comes across as pretty uncool. Oh and it is no surprise Jeremy sucks more than we knew but certainly suspected. Also Low is still way too okay with Jeremy doing some murder, and like, did she think he’d just be a well-adjusted dude post-murder and not ever be dangerous again? Lol. Honestly, this is all a bit much and sort of ruins the sort-of ambiguity you could be convinced of in the last book.'}]"

NEXT!and the suspense element was also much better in the first book because there was actually some action. the suspense (can we even call it that?) in this was so badly done compared to the first book. i think i appreciate ava and alex\'s story more in that aspect because we actually see it unfold and, like i said, there was actually some action. not only that, but right from the beginning, we\'re thrown into this ""suspenseful"" act so we go through the book wondering what\'s happening (even if you know what it was). with this, there was none of it for me.i liked that bridget volunteers at an animal shelter. my vegan animal loving self just loves everything animal care related.that\'s basically it.eh, i’m excited for jules and josh’s book though!and stella and christian? with that ending? 👀'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'OMFG this was so good !!! way better than the first one. this book fucked me up !! literally my bones were shaking the entire time i was reading this.Rhys -fuck !!! he’s a MFing DILF !!! this zaddy could take me anywhere. ok so get this - Bridget is the royal princess, she has some authority, but guess who’s in charge?

Say it ain\'t so!I have trouble passing up books with the word ""bodyguard"" in its description (cue ""I Will Always Love You"" by Whitney Houston). In fact, I picked up the first book of this series solely because I wanted to read this one. The princess and the bodyguard is a pairing as old as time, not to mention absolutely swoon-worthy, and before I cracked open the first page, I was filled to the brim with anticipatory glee for all the fun I was about to have.And for the most part, I enjoyed the story itself. It was a bit long-winded, but compared to instalove, I\'ll take a slow burn any day. While this didn\'t break any new ground and is pretty much what you\'d expect from the trope, it was still fun. Rhys the Bodyguard is all like I take security very seriously ma\'am, and Bridget the Princess is all like you can\'t tell me what to do. I\'m totally on board with that.And yet. Yet, yet, yet. I feel like something was missing. Was it better chemistry, more snarky banter? I\'m not sure. All I know is what I got felt like a paler version of what it could\'ve been. Or maybe the problem is me and I built this up so much in my head, nothing could possibly meet it.One thing I do know for sure is that Ana Huang\'s male characters are a bit too much for me. They\'re so sexed up and possessive, it\'s hard to take them seriously. They way they talk and act, you\'d think they came straight from the chest-thumping Stone Age. No other man can even look at their women, lest glares and threats erupt from their mouths. They\'re constantly like, Who do you belong to? Me! And that\'s more or less verbatim.And the sex scenes. Ugh, I feel like such an old fuddy duddy for saying this, but they were so frequent and unrealistic in that porny way, I was cringing with embarrassment for the characters. I enjoyed the first third of the book so much more simply because there was no sex in it. But the last two-thirds felt like every other scene was dramatic sex, and I was so over it.It\'s hard to really enjoy a story if I\'m cringing my way through so much of it, and that\'s what happened here. Obviously, romances are personal, and this is clearly a case where my tastes just don\'t quite line up with the author\'s. And there\'s nothing wrong with that.

This one is just way better for me. ITS STEAMIER, ITS SO POSSESSIVE, the tension between them. I’m literally so into it 😂And I cant stop thinking about Rhys. This man is BEAUTIFUL. All of the qualities i like in my alpha characters.How part 1 felt for me is mainly the reason this isn’t getting 5 stars because i feel like that’s my first impression and it’s like one of those things where when i was in school, people always told me to go with the first answer when i was taking an exam 😂 so I’m applying that same theory here LMAOChef’s kiss, i hope you guys enjoy this when you get to it!

You bicker like Nik and I do.” Her smile widened at the incomprehension on my face. “You bicker like siblings.”I LOVEDDD THE BOND BETWEEN RHYS AND HIS BROTHER ANDREAS LIKE DONT GET ME WRONG I HATED THE PRICK AT THE START BUT ONCE THEY FOUND OUT THEY WERE BROTHERS AND STARTED BICKERING IT FELT LIKE HE SOMEHOW WAS HEELING LITTLE RHYS 🥹⚠️Spoilers End Here⚠️Some of my favourite quotes:“Indoor festival,” he grunted.“You put this together.” It was a statement of disbelief more than a question.“Reluctantly, and with help.” Rhys glanced up. “Your redheaded friend is a menace.”not him lying when he set this whole thing up him self 😂“They’d only fluttered when we first met, but they’d died quickly after Rhys opened his mouth. ”I’m dead it’s giving most men 😂😭“If anything happened to her, I would murder Viggo. Slowly.”😂“Fuck pummeling his face. I wanted to knock all his teeth out.”common theme with Mr Larson 💀“Heard she went on a date today.”A vein pulsed in my forehead. First Andreas, now him. Why did every person insist on bringing that up? “I was there. But thank you for the breaking news.”The bastard laughed.”ahahaha I love this relationship between Christian and Rhys it’s giving Alex and Josh 😂😂“Bridget von Ascheberg was mine and mine alone. It didn’t matter that she wasn’t mine to take. I was taking her anyway, and if I could tattoo myself onto her skin, bury myself into her heart, and etch myself onto her soul, I would.”how romantic Rhys 😂“I told you, you’re mine, and I’m not letting you go. I don’t care if the entire Eldorran military tries to drag me away.”I loved how never backed down 😭“Pray you and Ava stay friends forever,”Alex casually threatening Jules 😂😂Now I just want to say I loved this but I’m not to sure if I’m going to like Josh and Jules book he just gives player I hope I’m wrong now on the hand I can not wait for Stella and Christian love the little hints Ana left for us ✨“Christian stood in the shadows, chatting with Andreas, but his eyes strayed to something—someone—on the dance floor. I followed his gaze and winced when I saw Stella.”'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3 stars (max)Plots wise I loved this book!

Sometimes I was weirded out by how possessive he was and just how Bridget did anything he said.The growling and crawling just isn’t for me.

Rhys and Bridget will always be one of my favourite couples of all time and I honestly can’t get enough of them!!First of all, this book has one of my favourite (but also one of the most painful) tropes of all time in it: Forbidden love!!!This alone already had me hooked and in love but the way it was executed… COMPLETE AND UTTER PERFECTION!!!!!The secrecy, the tension, the pining, the chemistry.. UGH it was just all soooo good and so well written!!! The way they both wanted one another since the beginning.. I was MELTINGGGG!!!!The way the forbidden love trope was mixed with the bodyguard x princess trope made it even better!!! The vibes and settings in this book were absolutely immaculate!! From gorgeous Costa Rica to a stunning castle ugh I LOVE IT!!! I honestly need more books like that with that sort of setting, it’s just so… romantic!!!Speaking of romantic, THESE TWO ARE DEFINITION OF SAID WORD!!!!!!I was literally squealing, giggling, kicking my feet, twirling my hair and blushing like a goddamn tomato!! They were just so adorable!! They had everything they needed to have! Banter, chemistry, tension (romantic and sexual), cuteness, jealousy, spice and MOREEEE!!! They’re just so perfectly written I could cry!!!The way they’re also each others’ rocks?!?!Like Rhys being able to be himself and open up to someone for the first time and feeling so comfortable and feeling AT HOME with Bridget, made my heart beat a million miles per second!!!Same the other way around!! Bridget feeling so at ease with him and actually being able to lean on someone and getting supported by Rhys… It was just so endearing to see them both act so sweetly with each other! No (pure) romance book couple has ever lived up to their love (if you ask me)!!!!!Rhys is also the most perfect man ever!!! He’s definitely the best Twisted man and he might not be YOUR favourite but you can definitely admit that he is THE BEST out of all the Twisted men! Like the way he stood by Bridget no matter what, fought so strongly for their love and is willing to give up everything just to see her happy?!!! I’m crying, screaming…And HE DOES NO WRONG!!!! He didn’t need to grovel because HE IS PERFECT IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE (if it isn’t obvious enough I’m pretty much in love with him lol)Anyway.. besides the romance, I loved the sub-plot of politics and monarchy! It was amazingly involved into the plot and just shows how corrupt the system can be (most definitely not only in fiction).Seeing Ava and Alex again, happy and together, was also so pleasing to read about and seeing the other characters as well was so endearing!Let’s just say I loved every second of this book and if you haven’t read it yet… GET TO IT NOW!!!!! It is worth EVERYTHING!!! Even if you may have disliked the first book, definitely give this one a try!!Overall, this will most likely always be my favourite romance book and Ana Huang book ever and I’m so glad to have read it not only once but twice!! And I’m already looking forward to rereading it again sometime in the future! I also can’t wait to reread Twisted Hate tomorrow!!'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'I still cant get over the fact that how the fuck this series is so hyped 💀...especially when there are better..WAY better and sexier books than this'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '✩ 4.35 stars ✩“I was a rule follower by nature. It was how I’d survived most of my life. But for Bridget, I would break every rule in the book.”What to Expect:➼ Princess x Body Guard➼ Age Gap (10 years)➼ Forced Proximity➼ Forbidden Romance➼ Secret Relationship➼ Touch Her & Die➼ Sizzling Chemistry➼ Slow Burn➼ Grumpy x Sunshine➼ Dual POVI disliked Twisted Love so much that it took me 2 years and dozens of glowing reviews to convince me to give this series another shot. Happy to report that the rumors are true! Twisted Games really is as good as they say. Maybe I just love all men named Rhys 🤔, but I felt like I was reading a grown up version of the Princess Diaries and I mean that as the highest compliment. The two year jump in their relationship threw me a little at first, but I think it was needed to support that he really was a professional and that his heart softened to her over time.After her brother abdicates his claim to the thrown, Bridget finds herself as the unexpected heir. With this unwelcome change, she feels the last vestiges of her free will slipping away and creates a lists of things she wants to do before she takes the thrown. She basically propositions him, and I felt that this was the best way for them to finally come together. I don’t think he would have ever crossed that line if he hadn’t felt like it was what she needed. He could deny himself, but he couldn’t deny her anything. 🙌🏻 He also thought they would be parting ways since she would no longer need private security once she was living at the palace full time which added to the plausibility of him choosing to break protocol with her.This was a little longer than I typically like a contemporary romance to be, but I always felt very engaged in the story. Their chemistry was sizzling and their backstories and personalities were perfectly developed. I LOVED that we got to read from both POV’s. Nothing beats dual POV with a strait-laced grumpy MMC. I honestly can’t get over how much better this book was. 🤯 So glad I gave it a shot!Rhys Larsen has officially been entered into the book boyfriend hall of fame. 🏆 They need to make this a movie immediately!

There were also constant, non-stop time jumps that made it completely impossible to actually see any (supposed) development between these two: It’s all tell, and no show. We never really went into detail in any conversation or situation: we literally glanced over everything.Also, Rhys was the most bland hero ever and Bridget had no personality either. All of their interactions honestly bored me to tears or simply just pissed me off. They had no chemistry at all.Part of me wanted to push her away from me, and another part wanted to drag her into my arms and keep her as mine. Except I couldn’t. Bridget was too young, too innocent and too off-limits, and I’d damn well better not forget that.So all in all, there simply wasn’t any depth to be found here, and neither did I see any actual love between them. Once they actually got together all they ever did was have sex. They had no emotional intimacy whatsoever.“Remember. In public, you’re my princess, but in private, you’re my whore.” His other hand reached down and pinched my swollen clit until I squealed, and the beginning tremors of an orgasm rocked through me. “You’ll do what I say, when I say it, and you’ll take my cock however I want. Won’t you?”“Yes,” I breathed.And don’t even get me started on the dirty talk or the weird power dynamics between these two during sex… Every time they were together in anintimateway I just had to cringe.“Keep your underwear, gloves and heels on, and crawl to me.”My breath gusted out in shock even as my core spasmed at the order. I’d never crawled for anyone in my life—while I was all but naked, no less. Even if I wasn’t the future queen, it would be degrading. Humiliating. Depraved. And I’d never been more turned on.I sank to my hands and knees, and I began to crawl.Lastly, the plot in this book was seriously as uninteresting and boring as humanly possible. I genuinely couldn’t care any less.'Twisted' series:1.Twisted Love- 3.5 stars2.

Smart? Check. Kind? Yup. Down-to-earth, but also totally knows her worth? Double-check. She’s got that mix of being funny, sassy, and just has this vibe where she won’t back down from anyone—not even him. She\'s passionate and strong, but also low-key vulnerable at times. And don’t even get me started on how she handles her problems. I love characters that wear a mask and pretend everything’s okay when they’re actually dealing with a ton (bc I relate) Bridget’s totally like that—seems tough, but you can tell there’s a lot more going on beneath the surface.❝The message: in control and ready to take over.The reality: a complete mess.❞^ THIS is what I’m talking about. Bridget’s journey was wild. Watching her shift into “queen mode” over just a few months? Iconic. She went from struggling to straight-up dominating, all while keeping her cool and making sure she wouldn’t back down. Chef’s kiss.❝Somehow, somewhere along the way, I\'d grown into my new role. It would take a while before I was fully comfortable with it, but I was getting there❞Also, I know we all love when the guy is protective over the girl, but it hit different when Bridget was the one doing it. Like, changing the law for him? *BOW DOWN* to Bridget. She’s a literal queen, period.Okay, before y’all come at me, I gotta be real: Rhys is hot, sure. But personality-wise? Meh. I get that he’s a “bad boy with a soft side,” but honestly, he didn’t do much for me. BUT the way he’s obsessed with Bridget? Oh my god, it hits differently. The way he talks about her? Heart-eyes for days.❝Even when I was pissed at her, I wanted her❞❝I loathed it. Loathed her, for tempting me this way. Loathed myself, for not having more self-control when it came to her❞Like, can we talk about the spice? 🔥 Straight-up fire.

But, like, Zade own that line, I’ll give Rhys a pass on that one, though.This author knows how to write addicting stories. I tore through “Twisted Love” in two days last year, and this one? I thought it was gonna take me forever because it’s longer, but nope. One sitting. Done. The writing? Okay, it’s not gonna win any awards, but it’s like crack. I couldn’t put it down.The relationship? A slow burn to the MAX. Like, it took years for them to admit their feelings and attraction. And honestly, I’m here for it. I read another bodyguard romance recently, and they fell for each other way too fast for my liking. But this one? They really made us work for it, and I was vibing with the tension. I think it was done really well, no filler scenes to slow it down.Now, the plot? Um... it was a bit of a mess. (Typical for this author, honestly.) Rhys suddenly being royalty? Not buying it. But the betrayal from Bridget’s assistants? That was believable. Still, the whole royal blood thing felt forced. I hate to say it, but the book didn’t deserve all the hype. Like, yeah, I enjoyed Bridget. Rhys was hot. The spice was great, but that was basically it. It’s getting a lot of praise, and while I enjoyed it, I don’t think it lives up to the hype everyone’s giving it. I expected something extraordinary.**The Side Characters**Ava was just... there. Totally forgettable, as expected. Every time Alex was mentioned, I was like *eye roll*—sorry not sorry. Jules, though? Always fun. And that scene with her disappearing with Josh at the end? 👀 Christian is the real star. He’s twisted, insane, and I’m hooked on his storyline. The way he was eyeing Stella at the end? Can’t wait for that drama to unfold. Christian and Stella? That\'s what I’m living for in this series.So yeah, overall, I’m torn. I loved Bridget and the slow-burn romance, but the plot was messy, and some of the hype feels overblown. Still, if you\'re here for hot characters, slow-burn tension, and a little bit of chaos, this one’s definitely worth the read. Just don’t expect a life-changing book.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '2023:rhys, me puedes pedir que gatee cuando quieras.2021:yes yes yesnecesito maaaaasel tercer libro me emociona demasiado !!!'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Rhys Larsen🧎🏻\u200d♀️that’s it.

made the writing really easy to read and it was a bonus because i’m irish🥹the writing was absolutely amazing. it blows my mind that a 600+ page book pulled me out of a reading slump that i was stuck in for a month. that’s just how you know the writing was good. as soon as i started this book, i couldn’t put it down. i was completely invested in every single page. a few of you asked me about the size difference of the books and if there was anything cut out. for example, the indie versions were really thick, the uk versions are thick, but the new bloom books editions are way thinner. basically, bloom books made the pages thinner. i’m not too sure how that works, but nothing of the original book was cut out! just thinner pages with a tiny font. please don’t let the length of the

feeling thoroughly deflated, only to have a warm hand wrap around my wrist and pull me back to his side.”not you,” johnny whispered in my ear, settling me in front of him. “them.” his blue-eyed gaze darted to the two older boys watching us with curious expressions, and in a tone that left no room for discussion, he said, “go.”╰┈➤A MAN!!!!!! a man. that was hot.”you’re beautiful,” he stated, causing my cheeks to flush a deep shade of pink.a boy had never called me beautiful before. not like this. not with such forwardness. not with such sincerity.he tucked a loose strand of hair behind my

breathing erratic.“your legs. seems only fair since i’m taking up all the legroom.”“you want me to put my legs on you?”“i want you to be comfortable.”“uh, okay?” blowing out a shaky breath, i gingerly shifted my legs onto his lap. “is that good for you?””yeah, shan.” offering me a smile, “you’re good for me.””huh?””it,” he corrected gruffly, and then roughly cleared his throat. “it’sgood for me.”╰┈➤had me screaming into my pillow😭”hey, it’s little shannon,” gibsie chirped. “did johnny manage to coax you inside, or was it the smell of my fucking amazing cooking that drew you in?””you

my ear. “tell me if that’s not okay.”╰┈➤protect this man at all costs.reaching up with one hand, johnny cupped my chin and used his free hand to gently sweep my hair off my neck.then his fingers were tracing the bruises on my neck, his featherlight touch making my entire body tremble.”someone touched you,” johnny whispered in my ear, placing his fingers on the marks. “i want to know who.”the air escaped my lungs in an audible gasp. unable to stop myself, i sagged against his chest, eyes glued to our reflection in the mirror as he stared right back at me, blue eyes scorching holes in my soul.”tell me who put their hands on you,” he coaxed as he stood behind me, my face in his hand and his fingers on my throat. “and i’ll make it better.”╰┈➤the way this scene was so fucking heartbreaking, but so intimate at the same time and it has me wanting to walk straight into traffic!i thought about that for a moment.”do you mind?” i asked then.he smirked. “no, baby, i don’t

equivalent to ripping out each individual hair follicle on my head.i actually can\'t believe i avoided every spoiler on this book like the mf plague thinking this series was gonna be a banger. all that hard work for nothing. wattpad, i\'m so sorry for ever comparing this book to you. i\'ve read books on wattpad a million times better than whatever the fuck i just read.alright lets begin.the length. the length of this book is enough to make me go dizzy. 626 pages in the copy i had, but other copies have over 800 pages. what is going on here? chloe walsh, may i introduce you to an editor perhaps? this book did not need to be as long as it was. and i genuinely thought since it was so long there would actually be shit happening in the book. i was mistaken. the book had absolutely nothing going on for about 99% of it, and that\'s me being generous.chloe walsh must have thought she was saving the environment the way she recycled every single conversation and plot overnovernovernover again. basically just johnny driving shannon home every day and them having the same conversations. didn\'t realize he was signing up to be her chauffeur.shannonwhy in the fucking hell did i need to hear how small shannonlike the riveris every 5 seconds? there is absolutely no reason for me to be reading about how small she is the number of times i did.WE FUCKING GET IT.i was tired of it by the second page. yes, the second page. you read that correctly. it had already been mentioned at least 5 times by then. and then a million more times afterwards. shannonlike the riverand her tiny bone structure. she\'s so small and unable to do anything for herself. she needs literally anyone else to help her do the most basic human tasks.the way this character is infantilized and then sexualized is disturbing. they constantly remind us of how tiny she is and how she acts like a child. she legitimately cannot do anything without needing help from someone else. you would think she would have some sort of development by the end of the book but she remains unchanged. her whole home life plot is explored so little you could literally forget its a factor. the book had more than enough pages to delve into that plot. but all we\'re supposed to care about is this girl\'s constant loop of a relationship with the popular rugby player. not the reason why she is literally emotionally and physically stunted. she acts like a child but we\'re told she\'s actually ""mature"" lol okay. and then they love to mention her body every 5 seconds and how hot johnny and other boys find her.johnnygenuinely thought his name was josh the entire first half of the book. i hate this kid. all he did was talk about his dick for half the book, and how hot and tiny shannonlike the riveris and everything he wanted to do to her. being inside his head was the most painful experience of my life. the repetitive nonstop inner monologues really made me homicidal. pure torture it was putting myself through this. i could skip pages and still wind up back in the same spot.he loved to create problems for him and shannonlike the riverout of thin air. one of the dumbest characters i\'ve read about in a while. it was fun laughing at him sometimes though so at least there\'s that.where was the love? the chemistry? the connection? there was over 600 pages and somehow nothing to convince me these two were made for each other. johnny needs to get his ass back to dublin and shannonlike the riverneeds years of therapy and a stable household.anyways see below the big josh and tiny shannon. how lovely!joeyhe barely was in this book but he is the only good thing in it. carried the book. there is no way i would enjoy any other book in this series, but this man is a gem. i will appreciate his character from afar but i truly do love him so much.i brought the review back bc fuck the bullies yall can stay mad.───when the plan to br finally makes it out the dms 🤭iqralets hope we love it or hate it together <3'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'it’s been a long time since I’ve read a book where i don’t want it to end.i was expecting this book to be the typical high school romance where jock meets shy girl and ya it kinda is but it’s definitely much more. i love books that focuses on the characters, friendships, relationships and family dynamics and this book has all of it. tbh, i wasn’t gonna read this book but the rating is so high and i was curious and all but i’m so glad i did.ALSO, i wasn’t expecting this book to have aMariana Zapata type of slow burnand i was all for it. and i know this book is long af but it’s like that because there’smore showing than tellingand i loved this.story & charactersthis book is long af but it didn’t feel long. if books are like this, you know it’s really freakin good and it is.what drew me in are the characters. the story is pretty simple: girl gets bullied in her old school, she transfers to a more preppy/private school, she meets the most popular guy who also happens to be a rugby prodigy, they fall in love slowly but they both hide it from each other cuz duh its forbidden and all that. you know the drill. but the characters? fucking great. they were so relatable, hilarious, and the banter? the best thing i’ve read in a long time.the side characters,Gibsie(H bff) andClaire(h bff) are THE BEST. i don’t think i’ve ever laughed so hard, i feel nonexistent abs forming on my tummy until Gibsie is introduced in my book-life. and Claire? she’s the kind of friend every girl needs. both of these characters’ loyalty and support was so refreshing to read, i just love em and i ship both of these characters so bad too.Shannon (h) & Johnny (H)i felt so bad for Shannon that i just wanted to protect her from every single person who bullied and abused her. and knowing and reading about how she was being abused by her father? ughhhhh MY HEART. Shannon may seem weak, innocent, awkward, and naive (which is understandable after what she’s been through), but she’s actually so fucking strong, mature, the sweetest thing ever, and quite admirable tbh.and omfg Johnny is the best hero i’ve read in a loooong time. he’s the perfect balance of sweet and alpha/protective/possessive type of hero. even though his pushing away from the heroine and implicitly leading her on frustrated me to no end, i’m still really glad that he was the onedoing most of the chase. he may say to her he’s not interested but i mean, actions speak louder than words right?im also so glad that Shannon calls Johnny out when he makes mistakes instead of just “giving in” just because, you know, he’s hot. ugh*cue eyeroll*. i’ve seen this trend in soo many NA books that it’s annoying as hell but thank god Shannon ain’t one of those weak and doormat/horny heroines.dramawellll most of the drama here is the push and pull from both MCs, it can get frustrating, not gonna lie, but it’s definitely worth it.the OW drama here was kinda entertaining but also kinda not important? i don’t know it just feels like it’s there for the sake of drama or putting a wedge between the MCs and im honestly not complaining because i’ve been in the mood for petty teenage drama for quite a while.anywaysss, this book doesn’t have sex in it and it focuses a lot more on the stages of slowly and innocently (but genuinely) falling in love with your soulmate so if you like that, i recommend this 100%.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '""Boom, boom, fucking boom...I\'m done for.""Am honestly at a loss for words. I loved this book so much, it\'sdefinitely one of my favoritesfrom now on. Y\'all that ending was so heart breaking and yet I find myself being happy and loving that pain cause the book was THAT good.In no way it\'s a perfect book, it\'s flawed and the writing may not work for everyone, the pacing is slow but the characters and story are simply captivating.In thischaracter driven story,you\'ll find yourself rooting for them, understanding their pain and trauma, focusing on relationships, family dynamics and their growth as individuals.✔️ Sports romance (rugby)✔️ High School romance✔️ Slow burn✔️ Dual pov✔️ Set in Ireland during the timeframe of 2005✔️ Found family✔️ ""Who did this to you""It\'s only after I bought the whole series that I found out it\'s a high school romance, it did make me skeptical yet it worked out brilliantly. I especially loved how the actual sport played an important part in the story. I absolutely LOVE watching rugby, so having the inclusion of that made it even a better experience for me.Coming to the characters,Shannon and Johnnyhave my heart. These two are so adorable and so smitten by each other. I loved seeing them progress as strangers, to friends and eventually finally accepting their feelings for each other. The romance is so sweet and had me giggling.🩷Shannonis one of those characters who deserve the whole freaking world. She\'s been through so much, I wish I could give her the biggest hug. I honestly don\'t understand how people can find her annoying. Poor girl is so vulnerable and to see her open her heart and start trusting Johnny was such a proud moment for me. I hate what\'s happening to her. I wish she would reach out and accept help, I simply wish someone would save her and her brothers 😭🏉Johnnyis a fun, dorky and such a loving character. I admire his dedication to rugby and how loyal his teammates are to him, and he to them. His persona instantly puts people at ease and also the guy is straightforward- me likey. But to see him put himself through so much pain to achieve his goals was heartbreaking. I found myself relating to some of his struggles as I have been going through the same, so he does have a soft spot in my heart. I loved the scene in the hospital when he was high tbh, it was funny and so honest from him lol.Theside charactersare equally impactful and so easy to like.Joeyis someone am really rooting for. I want to see him happy so bad it breaks my heart. I want to get to knowAoifemore, she seems so sweet.Claire and Gibsie?Oh gosh, I ship it so hard 😩😩 I love Gibsie, he\'s so loyal and the sense of humor is elite lol.Lizzyseems upfront and seems to be hiding her own struggles but that\'s all I know about her. Shannon\'s parents and Bella can die, if I start ranting about how much I hate them this review will never end.Theendingbroke me as it ends on a sad and brutal note. I was expecting it to happen yet it hurt so bad. I have so much hope for the next book, hopefully will love it the same if not more.Highly recommended.Please check trigger warnings before reading this book.~•~•~Am so intimidated by the size of this book but IT\'S TIMEEEEEE'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '(4.25 ⭐️) Hi Johnny.

""the squinting only made me look disabled"" ??????? this was on page one so i should have KNOWN not to trust it would get any better- ""a girl, a fuckingfemale""- the main guy johnny to one of his guy friends: ""i hurt your feelings? who\'s the bitch with a vagina now?""anyway, save yourselves & don\'t read this book 😅'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""4.05!!“Boom, boom, fucking boom,”JOHNNY KAVANAGH FANS LOOK AWAY!!The first 200 pages of this book were absolutely horrendous, atrocious, the worst 200 pages that I have ever read in my life. I was so bleckh'd out by the fact that shannon was 15 and the amount of dick talks and dick mentions in Johnny's chapter was so infuriating like every fucking second you'd look at the book and it would Johnny and his dick being described LIKE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE STOP MENTIONING HIS POGO STICK+ the actual meaning of binding 13 💀💀. However, the remaining 600 pages were so much better, such a massive improvement, it captivated me and I enjoyed it soo much and the fact that I read it fast. I was topping because my house was getting fumigated so had to look at that and the moving took a lot of my time but this never let me let go of its grip. I would say I loved Shannons story and it gripped so much more than Johnny's, his was ok, I preferred reading about Shannon more. Her chapters were the redeeming part in my opinion.“¨I think I need you for keeps.¨¨I think I need you for keeps, too.¨”Johnny Kavanagh,He was such an asshole. I loved him when he was Shannon but when he was not? I hated him. He was a manwhore with the way he passed on from one woman to another but that was before Shannon and we didnt get enough page time so it did not bother me, what bothered me was the fact that he treated his friends like they were trash, threatening them, snapping at them. I remember hughie asking if he wanted lunch and Johnny was talking to shannon and instead of politely declining'Fuck off' He snappedlike come on man! and the way he treated Gibsie and all, I would never treat my friends like that, besides that I dont understand why he would punch the boyfriends of the girls who bullied Shannon when it wasn't even their fault like?? they dont control them?? and what would he do if that girl didnt have a bf? anyways, to the bfs who bullied shannon it was understandable but Cormac? did they not smooth things over? yes, they did but he still punched her for the doings of Bella even tho Cormac had nothing to do with it. What an asshole. Also, I love Joey and he was a bitch to him so -1 point for that. However his scenes with Shannon made me like him a lot, I love how considerate he was of her and how her life got better because of him and how much effort he put in for her.Shannon Lynch,My heart broke for her. I did not care for anyone besides her and Joey. I loved her story so much and ugh I hated what she went through if only I could give her a big hug and take all of her siblings with her to somewhere safe because I cannot imagine spending your childhood like that, so full of horror and trauma. it wasn't just her house but her school, her community. I was so pissed!! I could see her frustration, her anger and her resolve, her breakdown. It was actually heartbreaking to see what she went through but her story was so engaging and loved how her story was so easily redeemable.Joey, Aoife, Bella, Mam and Da, its a disgrace to put Joey and Aoife with them but I had to because I love them and I cant wait to read their story, Bella, Ma and Da can rot in hell.“I carefully scrolled through his playlists and almost had a heart attack when my eyes landed on the one named Songs for Shannon.”The romance was actually so sweet. I loved the slow burn and it was actually nice to see that they weren't in each others throats every two minutes. I enjoyed the sweet moments we got between them, Johnny really did care for her and gave her everything, I would like to see how their romance progresses in the next book considering the events of the end and how Johnny doesn't know but it was refreshing to see how it unraveled through this book.Overall, a solid novel!! (I didnt cry Hoda, gimme 100 dollars pls)___HodaandRowanhave been dying for me to read this and this also won my poll + i heard its like shameless so I am very excited to read Johnny and Shannon's story!""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""This was so,sogood...Excellent character building.Excellent relationship building.Just excellent all around.I loved the Ireland backdrop and the prep school setting, not to mention all of the hard-hitting topics.

I don't know why I haven't read this author before, but am now adding her entire back-list to my tbr.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5 boom boom fucking boom stars“I think I need you for keeps,” he slurred.“I think I need you for keeps, too,” I confessed.This book did something like boom boom fucking boom to my heart.I absolutely, wholeheartedly, deeply, madly and truly love Johnny and Shannon. There\'s this saying that you don\'t find a book but a book finds it way to you and it\'s so true because I have been ignoring this series for over a year but this year I finally caved in and guess who\'s obsessed? ME! I was just 10 chapters in the story and I already knew I was going to give it 5 stars.He smiled down at me. “Hi, Shannon.”“Hi, Johnny,” I whispered, staring back at him, feeling like my heart was two seconds away from bursting out of my chest.I was a bit scared to read this because I rarely read high school romances where teenagers behave like a bunch of rich kids who thinks they are the king of the world. But this book was so realistic in terms of high school trope and I loved how Chloe actually didn\'t wrote her characters as some rich assholes who are too good for the world. All the characters were teenagers going through that crazy and young phase but they were written in such a real and realistic way. Yes, there were some cringy and cliché moments but they are teenagers so it was absolutely understandable.“She was nice to think about. She was fucking beautiful. Her voice. Her hair. Her smell. The way she spoke. Every single part of her.”The plot is more of character-drivenand the pacing was slow but I definitely don\'t mind it because I never wanted to end this book. Chloe can write ten books about Johnny and Shannon doing dumb ass shit and I would still read them with hearts in my eyes. I loved the writing because it was easy to read and captivating and it worked well for me because it\'s a 500 plus pages book. This might be not everyone\'s writing style because there was no flowery euphemisms or allegories. I love how the story was not just focused on the romance part.The character\'s development was slow but done so well and there\'s still a lot to unpack in Keeping 13 but I love it because healing is not a linearand I would love if there is a real growth to Shannon and Johnny\'s character. I also loved the found family trope in this one.“Look at me,” he repeated, tone calm and coaxing. I couldn’t. I felt him shift beside me and then his fingers were on my chin, tipping my face up to his. “You’re safe,” he whispered, cupping my cheek in his hand, eyes boring holes straight through my soul. “I promise.”This book is the slowest slow-burn I have ever read in my lifeand I didn\'t hated a bit even though I was dying for them to kiss each other and when that happened I was literally dead because they are so adorable. The way they met for the first time was so funny and adorable and I immediately knew right then that they are going to be my new obsession and my new comfort couple. I have never felt this many butterflies in my stomach while reading a book about two teenage people who are madly in love with each other but refuse to accept their feelings.“Well, thanks for caring,” I breathed.“Thanks for being worth it,” Johnny replied, hand still on my cheek.➸ Shannon LynchThe girl with sad eyes. The moment I saw her I had this immediate need to protect her from the world. Her story broke my heart 🥺 She deserves the best in the world. Shannon\'s is such a vulnerable and fragile girl with the biggest and the kindest heart in the world. She\'s the quiet one with the traumatic childhood and school experience who just wanted a clean slate at a new school. I hate how people treated her at her old school and I\'m glad Johnny beat the shit out of them for calling her out by names. She\'s used to being alone, has trust issues, build a huge wall around herself to protect her, never had anyone by her side except her brother Joey. She\'s been dealing through a shit life and has no self-confidence and self-esteem because people treated her like shit all her life. I hate it when the authors or the mmc can\'t shut up about how the fmc is so small and short and tiny and Chloe did exactly the same but I think it was done to portrayed her character as vulnerable or fragile girl and to make readers empathise with her. She has a lot to heal and move on from in her life but she\'s doing it all her pace with Johnny and her loved ones by her side.“For once in my life, I wanted a safe place to run to instead of from. I felt like I was slowly dying in that house. In my home. Where I was supposed to lay my head. Where I was supposed to feel safe.”➸ Johnny KavanaghHE IS THE DEFINITION OF BOY OBSESSED AND WHO DID THAT TO YOU TROPE.He\'s broody and a bit grumpy with all that""Rugby is my life""attitude but he\'s so thoughtful, respectful, caring, and just incredible. He has DIMPLES AND HE LOVES DOGS? HE\'S PERFECT! I hate it when man picks fight for their woman like she can\'t do that herself but Johnny is an exception. I\'d let him slay all my dragons if he wants to. He did that with Shannon, fought on her behalf, threatened the kids at his school to not talk shit about her and it\'s not because he\'s strong and all, it was because he wanted and needed to protect her and he wanted her to protect him in some way. His povs were everything! He\'s a very strong minded person with a very obsessive personality. No matter how perfect he appears to all the other people, Johnny is such a scared boy with dreams and hopes. He has his own demons and fears that can destroy his career and I get it why he tried to hide his injury from everyone because no body wants to see how you can lose everything you have worked for your whole life destroy right in front of your eyes.“Problem was, every time she ran, I found myself chasing right after her, desperate to just be with her.”╰┈➤ Shannon & JohnnyRight person, Right time.They make my heart go like WOAH. They are complete opposites of each other in terms of status, personality and upbringing. He wants to save her and she wants to hide from her past and everything. She\'s a damaged soul but he\'s determined to save her and love her. They had me swooning and giggling at Every. Damn. Moment. The giddiness I felt when they were in formed proximity and when Johnny was driving her to home and everytime he threatened the kids at school to stay away from“My Shannon”(don\'t love it when they lay claims on woman but it\'s Johnny so he can do anything to me). He had a playlist of songs that reminded him of her and they were all love songs and he spent thirty minutes in rain trying to find her shoe and you are telling me he is fictional 😭 He tried to find ways to spend time with her because his heart didn\'t wanted to let go of her.“Someone touched you,” Johnny whispered in my ear, placing his fingers on the marks. “I want to know who.”“Now,” I sneered, glaring down at their faces. “Who wants to call my girlfriend a whore to my face?”“Give me a name,” Johnny growled, dropping his hands to his hips. “And I’ll take care of it.”“What— no! I’m grand,” I quickly replied. “I have allergies.”“Me too. To assholes and bullshit,” Johnny snarled.“Now, tell me who made you cry and I’ll fix it.”The feminist in me is dead after meeting Johnny Kavanagh🤸🏽\u200d♀️He wanted to be her friend but also couldn\'t be her friend and all the dilemma, confusions, denials and bulldozing (Iykyk) worked so well in the end. I love that they just didn\'t had this lust and tension between them but they also had an emotional and intimate connection. They understood each other so well and helped each other in their own way. They had this easy going relationship and friendship. The way Johnny made everything easy for Shannon at school, the way he protected her, loved her, took care of her everytime, and the way Shannon saw the real Johnny behind Johnny the perfect boy and the perfect rugby player. Johnny was so patient with her and waited for her to open up to him about her abusive life. How he was afraid of talking to her about his insecurities and fears yet he tried his best with her. They are just so so prefect for each other. Definitely soulmates!“Shannon.” Johnny’s hand snaked out and wrapped around my wrist. “I don’t want you to go,” he said gruffly, tugging me back down beside him. “I want you here.” He rested a hand on the bed right behind my back and leaned close. “I want you to stay with me.”— Side Characters —➸ Joey:Perfect brother and I already love him. Can\'t wait to read his book but I already know his book is going to break my heart in pieces.➸ Aoife:She\'s so precious and I love the way she\'s always there for Joey and his family.➸ Claire:Love love love her. She\'s the best with her kind-hearted spirit and sweet nature. She\'s the type of friend who would hype you up all the damn time.➸ Gibsie:He was a bit annoying in the start but his character grew on me a lot. His friendship with Johnny is so precious. I can\'t wait for his book. Claire and Gibsie literally behaved like a married couple in this book. He follows her, cracks weird jokes and Claire retorts with her witty replies.➸ Lizzie:The ice queen of their group. A bit annoying but I love whoever loves Shannon.The hospital scene at the end is my roman empireand it was so adorable, so cute, so comforting. Just everything.“I’m keeping her, Da.”“Okay, son,” he coaxed. “You keep the girl.” “She makes my heart go, like, whoa.”“Is that right?” he mused.“So bad, Da.” I sighed. “Boom, boom, fucking boom.” I shook my head. “All the time.”The endingbroke my heart because Shannon didn\'t deserve that 😭, but I\'m hoping for a better life for her inKeeping 13.“If this is love, then it’s you,” he replied, dragging me down to lie beside him.“You are love.” He sighed contently. “Stay with me.” Always.“I’ll stay with you,” I whispered, feeling more in this moment than I could handle.💌 This is not just a story about a girl who was mentally and physically abused by her father and her classmates. It\'s not just about romance or friendships. It\'s about how to let someone in your life and how to develop your trust again and how to fall in love while also figuring out your fears and insecurities. It\'s about letting yourself move on from the life of difficulties and pain and trauma. It\'s about finding comfort, a home, a sense of security and love in other people. It\'s also about dreams and how to overcome your fear of losing them. It\'s about healing. It\'s just about life ❤️\u200d🩹——————————Definitely worth all the damn hype in this world!

What to expect: lots of tears & mental breakdowns.#1Binding 13↠ 4.25 stars#2Keeping 13↠ 5 stars'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5 MILLLIONNNNN STARS⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ i’m beyond obsessed. no review could do this book justice but wow. i’m SPRINTING to keeping 13!!!!!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '4.5*I had no intention of writing a review but the words were banging around my brain screaming to be let out so here we are. . .I was completely hooked from the start. The writing was so easy to read, it was very straight forward. After reading Nocticadia, the simplicity was exactly what I needed.The story felt very mindless from the beginning to middle of the book but it really picked up after that.This book is not perfect at all. Despite that I adore the characters and their relationships both familial and romantic.Shannon is my traumatised lovable sweet and smol pookie 😭I actually feel for her sfb. I just wanna give her a hug for 15373747 years it’s not fairrrrrr 💔The heartache from reading about her past and seeing how she suffered sm brought me to tears. I felt like jumping into the book and using all the tools in the universe to get retribution on everyone who hurt her istg- 🔪I can understand how her size and age being emphasised again and again could annoy anyone really but to me it just drills in the fact that all this was happening to a fifteen year old girl that should’ve been living her life normally. Her house, her home, the place she rests her head(!!) is supposed to allow her to de-stress and find some peace. What should’ve been her sanctuary was actually the most destructive place for her. Her small frame is directly linked to this as well. It’s really shitty to read about and I hate this for her (ಡ_ಡ)There wasn’t much of Shannon being carefree but she was adorable asf when she was in her element. Them playing GTA was the most I’ve seen her let go and gahhhh I loved every second of it 🤭💗🫂*Johnny is the most precious guy ever.What I love the most about him is that when he feels really solid about what he wants, he goes after it with his all. But what came out of his all or nothing attitude towards life hurttttttt ❤️\u200d🩹❤️\u200d🩹Him being indecisive about whether he wanted to pursue a relationship with Shannon was so valid. The reservations he’s kept and been reiterating in his head for years, about how his profession isn’t gonna leave any room for a relationship, that can’t just be broken down within seconds. It’s frustrating to read about sure but I understand the reason behind it.Watching him go from being calculated and orderly to berserk and punching her bullies had me going ferallll andjdhdj 💃It shows exactly how much she’s affected him and his life.Ugh I love him sfmmmm 🥹💗💗That hospital chapter was worth EVERYTHINGHHH 🤧✋ he made my heart go woah fr.He was actually so funny omfdssss. There were so many times he had me howling bc of his one liners 😭 he’s iconic, it’s true.Him being so adorableeeeee towards Shannon and the small moments between them had me shaking screaming dying. I love them together sfm it hurts.When he would thread his hand through her hair and ask for consent to hug her? ☝️. . . 💃🚂his affectionate touches? *sigh*HIM MAKING A PLAYLIST THAT REMINDS HIM OF HER?? 🤸🕳️Even the little things he would do like holding her bag or giving her his jacket?searching for her lost shoe in the rain???EVERYTHING.It all got to me. I’m obsessed.Gibsieeee my best boi.I absolutely adore the shit outta this guy. He’s my top man. The way he made me laffff so fucking loud at the most inopportune moments ugh chefs kiss. Especially when he was annoying Johnny abt his ~problems~ Omf I was wheezing. (He gives Seth vibes so hard I’m in loveeeee 🙏)Also the sum sum we’re getting with him and claire is not enough!!! I need moreee 😭Joey 😭😭 my heart goes out to him. This guy deserves to have everything in every universe.He’s the best brother. Him leaving Shannon there bc he couldn’t take it anymore killed me even tho I’m glad he put himself first (╥_╥)I wanna cry just thinking about the ending of this book 😭🔫The only thing I will say is that this book has a certain style of writing that doesn’t fit everyone. But personally I felt like there’s something really effective in Chloe’s writing that makes me connect to the characters and their situations.What bugged me most was the fact that there were a lot of scenes that I felt were kind of pointless idk. For example the denial scenes, Iykyk. There were too many of them. One or two is fine but EIGHT?! That could’ve been cut down. Especially bc those scenes would be so long and their conversations would not add anything big to the plot.Also there’s a difference between him denying his love for Shannon and him being indecisive over wanting a relationship with her. The former just annoyed me a lot.However, there were certain scenes which were used again and again but I felt they were necessary. For example, JohnnyShannon and their drives or Johnny taking care of Shannon however he can. It’s important for this to be shown more than once bc Shannon needs to feel that steady stability, that removal of doubts, which he’s giving her by repeating those reassuring words and actions. She needs to feel like he’s a constant in her life and that he’s reliable enough to be her safe haven.Even though there’s a long way for them to reach that level of trust, these scenes are basically the groundwork to get there. I love that we got to see most of these scenes fully playing out and not just being told he drove her home BAM end scene yk?There was ONE part which I would’ve died for and that was when he took her to the cinema 😭 it’s not fairrrr! Chloe release that scene from the vault I beg 🔪So basically this book made me laugh like a hyena (mostly gibsie’s fault), cringe quite a bit, hunt for a grave to temporarily lie in, sport the biggest grin, vibrate with anxiety, lose years off my life, develop wrinkles, and cry. Definitely the crying :). . .

SHE’S JUST A KID!! butshe basically raised 3 kids all on her own.she took care of sean, tahdg and ollie more than her mom ever did and it makes me SO MAD. all her mom did was cry for no reason whilst shewatched her kids get ABUSED and TORMENTED🙁a lot of people don’t like her too much bc she’s too stubborn or awkward but my god can you blame her? with that trauma, it’s impressive she can even trust anyone when she can’t feel safe around her own parents 💔💌I liked safe. In my world, invisibility equaled safety.I was happy to be wallpaper and blend in. 💌guys. she is literally my spirit animal. I know what it’s like to fear your own family. and it fucking sucks. being scared whenever they walk into a room, finding any possible excuse to leave the house, it’s genuinely horrible. when we are together, it always ends in me crying. there’s always something “imperfect” about me to comment on just so there’s a reason to yell. and that’s why I felt her to my core. she never did anything but she always suffered for absolutely no reason. just bc her dad felt like using a punching bag. like her, I don’t have a temper, I just sob, and sob, and sob.🧸 I was annoyed with myself for being the kind of person who cried when angry. I wanted to be a shouter. A shouter was much better than a crier. 🧸never did I want to jump into a book and give a character a hug as much as I did in this moment. shannon lynch, you are so strong <3🏉 johnny kavanagh 🏉ohmygod. I can’t even talk about him without squealing like a lovesick teenage girl (newsflash: I am a lovesick teenage girl). he makes me so giddy it’s actually fucking WEIRD. and then I remember he’s just words and I get depressed. ask my bsf, I will vent to her about him for hours like he’s an actual PERSON.the most greenest forest in the universe.in a world of gross filthy boys, he is a gentleman and everything more 🥹 he cared for shannon in a way I’ve never seen with any other man. he was masculine and attractive, but without that toxicity and gross ego they usually have. he made her FEEL SAFE, when she thought she couldn’t with anyone else in the world. I love him I love him I love him I love him I love him I love him I love him I love him I love him.anyways.I love him. did I mention that? I don’t think I did.🎀I can take you home when you have to go? What the actual fuck?

Which might sound strange as it covers some heavy themes.For me it comes down to how genuine everything in this book is.It feels like life; real, a bit heartbreaking at times and the best when surrounded with people you love.✦“He added fresh bruises to old bruises.”✦This is a brutally honest depiction of that time between adulthood and childhood, of teenage love and friendships, not sugar-coating issues within families but also showing the strength that can be found there.Binding 13 is unique in the sense that the friendships and sibling relationships in this arejustas good as the romance. At times I even loved Joey & Shannon's relationship more.Going into this I was a bit worried I wasn't gonna be able to connect to the characters as they are very young, and I usually prefer reading books with characters closer to my own age.That fear was quickly demolished. The writing is incredibly immersive.It was effortless to fall into this, feeling the struggles of being a teen stuck in difficult situations whilst also handling things such as crushes, grades and finding yourself.✧“Shannon Lynch was the greatest weapon of mass destruction my heart has ever been exposed to.”✧It's not fair to write a review on this book and not write about the romance. It's so clear to see that they are made for each other and you cannot help yourself from rooting for them from early on.It's that innocent type of teenage love that comes with butterflies and overthinking, but it still has such depth.Their mutual shy crushes made me feel all giddy as if I was the one with a crush. If someone dedicated She Will Be Loved to me, I would marry them on the spot. 😭✧“My heart. My poor, poor heart. I didn’t stand a chance with this boy.”✧The friendships in this has a dedicated place close to my heart. Gibsie and Johnny, Shannon, Lizzie and Claire. Not to be repetitive, but what I love about it is that it's so sincere and feels so real.Them being there for each other, knowing each other inside and out, relentless teasing and inside jokes, and just simply being comfortable in each other's company. This combined with the early 00's vibes gave off such an amazing ambiance throughout the book. (Being real for a second though, home-burned mix CD's is such a lost art. Spotify playlists just don't hit the same.🤧)Although the length of the book intimidated me initially, the pacing was perfect and had no real downtime which is very impressive for a book of over 800 pages. It went by much faster than I anticipated and I am extremely eager to continue this series going forward.______⌞pre-read:⌝I didn't think I would read this because I don't really get sports lol, but SK convinced me to give it a try. 🫶It's a bit intimidating going into this knowing how much people love it.

By doing so, you will be contributing to saving paper, valuable resources, and the reader\'s mental health as well as time. Thank you :)Before you proceed, I would like for you to understand that the followingrantreview contains a lot of swearing, incoherent rambling, and capitalized yelling. Reader discretion is advised.--lol that was fun, but now:Seriously, one thing I absolutely hate, no matter what genre I\'m reading istellinginstead ofshowing. This had SO MUCH of telling, SO MUCH - LIKE PAGES WORTH OF - inner dialogue and FOR WHAT?! The book was written in dual pov, so for most of the book I just had to see them both mentally waxing poetry about how good the other person looks. AND THERE WAS SM BELLA CONTENT? Like fuck her, why did I have to read SO much about her, I really don\'t understand. And all the scenes she was in wereliterally the sameIn Johnny\'s case - he only started to grow on me in the chapter where he was out of his senses and didn\'t know what he was saying.Thatis when I liked him most. We\'retoldhe\'s extremely picky when it comes to the girls he surrounds himself with, while in reality, his last fuck-buddy is an obsessive stardom-crazy bitch, and the girl he ""falls"" for is a girl with ""lonesome"" eyes and a dysfunctional family.I SWEAR TO GOD, THAT MAN HAS A LONER SAD GIRL KINK. Every time he had to describe her, he would mention how she was lonesome, fragile, uncertain - like yeah, makes you believe he absolutely loves the girl, doesn\'t it? 🙃We\'retoldthat he sticks to his routine, nothing in his life is more important than rugby, and he will not lose sight of what is important to him. In his pov, during the never-ending inner monologue, he goes on and on about how he\'s not one of those guys who waste their time on drinking and pussies. No, he has more important shit to do. In reality, he ignores his training for Shannon, goes out to drink with Gibs whenever invited, gets multiple hard-ons for Shannon, and cannot stop seeking her out everywhere after only meeting heronce. Yup, what a focused man.We\'re also told ample times that he hates lies when in reality, he tells multiple lies himself. Love me a hypocrite <3But I can ignore all this. What got to me most was his indecisiveness, and hot and cold behavior. He will think about how beautiful she is obsessively. He\'ll think about how much he likes her. He\'ll drop the l-bombs too - which they both do, as and when they wish, and then go back to the ""i don\'t even know you / we\'re friends"" bs - will give her multiple hints that he likes her because he\'ll always protect her whenever she\'s in trouble, go out of his way to give her multiple lifts home, share secrets about his injuries etc and then always center back to ""I cannot afford to do this,"" ""my career is on the line,"" ""i will go away so it\'ll only end up with both of us being hurt"" - and this repeated for like 800 pages, LIKE FOR FUCKS SAKE PICK A SIDE!The thing I liked about him though was how he always stood up Shannon, didn\'t get under anybody\'s influence, took good decisions even while drunk, and had a very cute dog. His morphine episode really made him extremely adorable and fun to read about, but we came back to good ol\' johnny when he woke up from his drug-induced coma. ALSO, HEART EYES FOR HIS PARENTS!2018 me would\'ve been on her knees for him though, given how protective he was.maybe i don\'t like him much bec the guy saves and protects the girl ALWAYS is not something i particularly enjoy reading now and that was what happened throughout the book.Moving on toShannon,i\'m going to try my best to get this across without coming across as a heartless bitch - I did not care about her. Yes, I felt bad about her situation. Yes, I wanted her to get out of her fucked up home. Yes, I disliked her parents. But her as a character, outside of that, fell super flat for me. I just don\'t understand how there was no character development in her when the book was 800+ pages long. Like somebody please explain it to me. Multiple times the abuse also felt like a plot device to me, because it was only shown on two occasions. One where her father finds the newspaper article and at the end. The last chapter left an impact on me, but I wished it had happened sooner, yk? Because throughout the book, most of the time, it\'s just Johnny noticing all her bruises, and then questioning her about them. Her anxiety after being bullied relentlessly was justified, but I like to see my characters try and fight that, instead of settling into that. Also, I get that not every fmc has to be a badass but I would\'ve liked seeing her mental battles, her tending to her bruises, her thinking about what she\'s been through, and how she could fight for herself. And I got none of that.I like good slow burns as much as the next person, but there was absolutely no burn here for the major part of the book. I really was rooting for my babies Gibs and Claire more than the main couple. I\'m salty about how little we got to see them, I NEED MORE! Everybody should have a best friend like Gibs, he was the highlight of the book for me. I absolutely love himhe even let that pedophile bitch suck his dick to get Shannon\'s file that johnny wanted, like 😭But for shannon and johnny, they went from 0 to 100 real quick, and went back to 0 even faster. Their whole dynamic was equal parts confusing and frustrating to me, and again, they justtoldus that they love the other person, but we never got to seehowdid that happen, or when did that happen. Like there was no flow to it. he just likes that she\'s not like other girls and she likes that he\'s hot and cares for her 😭😭I was also living for the Aoife crumbs we got, I already love her!The last chapter of this book was literally the most impactful one for me, and only for that is this book getting 3 stars. I really wish the whole book was like that, but I fucking hope keeping 13 does not disappoint me as much as this did.To,LilaandLilyyai\'m sorry my loves, i really wanted to enjoy this, but it was a miss for me 🥲 i\'m not giving up on keeping 13 though, i still have some hope <3To,MUSKAAAN,I know I\'ve said this multiple times, but I would\'ve dnf-ed this without you.

For example: plot happens in chapter 3...chapters 4 and 5 revolve around Shannon and Johnny relaying said plot in chapter 3 to their friends. NOTHING HAPPENS. It's like 1 step forward and two steps in place. I can literally skip entire chapters and still get the gist of what happens. By like the 40% point, the two main characters have had hardly any interaction- but I know all of the antics of their friends really well! Gibsie is hilarious! Lizzie is a drag. That Rowen character sucks. Gibsie and Claire sooo belong together and are blind to it (I sense the build up to their own book)...etc. The book mostly revolves around Shannon's shitty home life and school life, Johnny's sports and their friends. Which is all fine...except its more about all of those things than a romance. And it doesn't help that so much of the plot is repeated every other chapter.-There is slow burn romance....and then there is so slow, they literally go backwards- romance. The main characters have maybe 5/6 worthwhile scenes together and I am at the 72% mark. They talk the day Johnny hit Shannon in the head with a ball, they talk maybe once at lunch, they talk when she is forced to go over to his house twice, they have one meaningful conversation in his car and they go to a pub together. But most of their conversations revolve around him trying to figure out what the marks on her body are from, and kicking the asses of those who threaten her. They have kissed once (one sided mind you), talked a handful of times, yet they both feel like they are in love with the other. HOW?-I get Shannon is a wounded bird- but MAN her actions are frustrating to read. She's just SO meek and the ultimate damsel that needs saving.Everythingbad that could happen to her, happens to her. It's just a lot. And I get that she has had a hard life, but sometimes I just really wanted her to stand up and become a strong person despite all of that.-Although I am giving this a one star out of pure frustration with the plot-I do have to say that the dialogue is this book is fantastic and it is pretty well written in general.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '➼5★”Hi Johnny.”“Hi Shannon.”Hey Siri play “You are in love” (Taylor’s version)“One night, he wakesStrange look on his facePauses, he says‘Your my best friend’And you knew what it wasHe is in love”Welcome back to a brand-new review! I’m so excited to tell you about this book because I loved it so so much. First of all, I have to point out that you don’t have to be scared by the length of the book because—even tho it has almost 800 pages—the writing is captivating, and you don’t get bored. Holy mother of God I was so invested in these teenager dramas, it’s embarrassing…👀About the plot:This book tells the story of Johnny—a 17-year-old popular boy whose life turns around rugby and nothing else: no girl, no injury, no friend, no one can interfere in his dream, not even his parents. But something is about to change when he meets Shannon—a little girl, too young, too fragile, too damaged for him, but nothing is going to stop them to fall for each other.My thoughts (spoilers ahead):As I’ve already said, I fell in love with this book, even tho the story is abouttwo teenagerswho fall in love with each other. It’s very long but nothing stopped me to read 100 and more pages per day and I loved every single page of it. The story is captivating, a lot happens, and this makes you so invested that you can’t stop reading it. The writing is simple and since the author is Irish, she put aglossaryand thepronunciationof names you’ll find within. So don’t worry if you don’t understand or you don’t know some words, the glossary has them all, which I appreciate a lot since English—let alone Irish— is not my first language.I laughed, I cried, I got mad, and I felt pain but it was all worth it. Be ready because it\'s a journey...!!TW!! If you’re sensible to violence, please skip this part.Shannon: I need to present her a little before telling you what I think aboutShannon like the river. So, she is a 15-year-old girl, who lives with her parents and brothers. Joey—her older brother—is her anchor and I really appreciated the bond between them; they were fond of and protected each other. Shannon hasn’t an easy life: she’s been bullied since she started going to school by her classmates and she’s also been beaten up by her own father, who was an alcoholic. The situation got too far that her mother decided to make her change school by going to a private one, even tho the family wasn’t rich. This is where she met Johnny. On her first day of school he knocked her off during rugby, but he took really good care of her. From that moment, they were inseparable. Johnny took every chance he got to spend time with her, and soon they started falling for each other.Shannon is a very fragile person, with a lot of traumas caused by people in school and her own parents. She’s been through a lot and I wanted to hug her during the entire book. I’m so glad she found Johnny because she deserves happiness, but mostly she deserves to feel safe around people which is something we take for granted—at least most of us— because we feel safe in our home and we should feel safe. I know that’s not something every family has the privilege to experience, and it makes my heart break. I felt the pain Shannon felt, as well as the moment of happiness, sadness and fear she passed through. I had the need to protect her and I can easily understand why Johnny felt that too. The end made me cry my eyes out and my heart broke in thousands of pieces. I hope that in the second book she’ll have her safety feeling she desperately needs.“Family line”by Conan Gray reminds me of her.Johnny: I loved him so so much. Even tho he’s only 17, he’s very mature. He’s a really good guy, thoughtful, loyal to his promises, brave and kind. He def has an easy life: he has the money, the status, the rugby, a loving family, girls, good grades...He was very fond of Shannon tho, since the first day he met her, he didn’t even hesitate to step in and help her when she most needed someone to take care of her. He didn\'t judge her. Never. He also was very respectful with women and girls, not only with Shannon. As I said before, his life turns around rugby. That is his dream. However, he got injured and he had to have a delicate surgery. He was struggling because of pain but it didn’t stop him to chase his dream. I really admire his strength and his courage, tho I think he put himself in a very dangerous position.He\'s the sweetest guy without being too much. I have really few things to complain about: 1) the fact that it took too much time for him to realize his love for Shannon. Like dude wake the hell up!!! 2) He kept complaining about her age when he was literally 17 and she was 15—and in the middle of the book she turns 16, soooooo… I don’t find the age gap a big deal, I bet everyone in high school had a crush or dated someone older by 2 years or so. Again, not a big deal. But he kept saying that it was—in fact– a big problem. Eventually he got over this bullshit, thank Lord. 3) he didn’t kiss her back the first time she kissed him…Anyway, EVERYONE LISTEN CAREFULLY: HE HAD A PLAYLIST ON HIS IPOD FULL OF LOVE SONGS WITH HER NAME!!!!!!! He made her a freaking playlist with love songs. Like, if someone makes me a playlist with love songs is over for me, I fall in love immediately.Their relationship: I freaking loved every second of it. The most beautiful thing was that they were friends before being lovers. They supported each other, they wanted to spend every second together, she felt safe with him, and he protected her always. I loved the little things happened between them, like hands touching and so on.Also, the end was so touching. The fact that he kept telling his parents that she was the one… AHHHH!!! Just perfect. Really.Do I recommend this book? Absolutely YES.If you like teenager dramas and cute love stories, this book is for you but be careful and read the TWs first!Some quotes:“""Because you\'re beautiful,"" […]A boy had never called me beautiful before.Not like this.Not with such forwardness.Not with such sincerity.Johnny said it, though, and my heart was flapping around in my chest like a demented, caged bird, fighting to escape.[…]“Inside and out”[…]""Everywhere.””“If feelings were objects, then I was teetering on the edge of a great precipice, and if girls were weapons, then Shannon Lynch was the greatest weapon of mass destruction my heart had ever been exposed to.”“But I already felt like I was drowning with her.That\'s how consumed I was in this girl.That\'s how much I loved her.”“""She makes my heart go, like, whoa.""""So bad, Da,"" I sighed. ""Boom, boom, fucking boom."" I shook my head. ""All the time.""[…]And then I heard those two words.""Hi, Johnny.""""Boom, boom, fucking boom. Da,"" I groaned, slapping a hand against my chest ""I\'m done for.""”“And those fucking midnight blue eyes - which I didn\'t think was a good enough word to describe the color.They should have been called soul blue because they were deep as fuck and sucked a person right in…”“Instead, I nestled my cheek against his side and closed my eyes, allowing myself to drift off to sleep without an ounce of fear in my heart because it couldn\'t exist inside of me, not when this boy had his arm around me.”01/08:rereading bc i miss my babies🙂\u200d↕️'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I am not exaggerating.

I usually prefer stronger fmc\'s, with more personality. Even so, it\'s obvious that she\'s going through a VERY difficult situation of abuse, both at home and at school, and it\'s something that\'s been slowly accumulating for years, so I understand why her personality is more fragile and why she\'s so easily intimidated by others.It was very hard to read the scenes in which she was about to get in her house bc i could also feel her anxiety, not knowing if it was going to be an ok day or if she had to start thinking of how to cover the bruises and make up stories for the next day.Biological family is that part of life that you cannot choose, you\'re either born in a good loving caring supportive family or you don\'t. So reading her longing for a happy place, a safe place, it was very heart wrenching and i just want her to find the happiness and peace she deserves.“For once in my life, I wanted a safe place to run to instead of from.I felt like I was slowly dying in that house.In my home.Where I was supposed to lay my head.Where I was supposed to feel safe.”𓍯𓂃Johnny:now... i never thought than a man called johnny would make me feel like this, but here we are. I\'m always DOWN for a man who is determined, has his goals clear, looks like he wants to kill everyone but is willing to go all the way and beyond to protect you and keep you safe. And Johnny is all that and more. He\'s tough and ready to fight anyone who gets in his way, but as soon as he senses that Shannon is in trouble (which happens every 2 secs), he\'s right there ready to take matters into his own hands... andI\'m weak, what can I say?Regarding his ambition to pursue a rugby career, it was honestly so impressive bc from the start you realize how big of a deal it is for him, that\'s what he has always wanted and worked for, to the point that he\'s been compromising his own health for it because he doesn\'t think he\'s anyone without rugby.And at the same time he\'s starting to realize that for the outside people rugby is his whole identity and there\'s no world in which he can be considered an individual asides from it, so it\'s very important for him, once he meets shannon, that she seems to be one of the few people who think about him just as johnny the teenager, not the rugby player.“I wanted to fight all her battles. I wanted to give her all her smiles and make her laugh and snatch her away from the rest of the world and keep her all to myself. I just wanted her. For keeps.”𓍯𓂃Claire and Gibsie:they were both very cute, I loved reading their banter and how it is CLEAR as daylight that they both love each other, so I can only imagine how their relationship will go on their own book (if the author doesn\'t mess it up). They were always so so so supportive of their friends, especially Gibs, I found him to be like the BEST wingman and ""sidekick"" lol, he was always a call or txt away from showing up and helping Johnny in whatever he was needing.𓍯𓂃Joey:my baby... ughhhhh!!! i just KNOW that he has suffered SO SO SO much, having to step up and basically grow up prematurely and raise his siblings as if they were his own.. i\'m sure we don\'t know the EXTENT of his trauma yet and as an older sibling myself, who\'s always looking out for the younger ones (darren doesn\'t count to me idc), it breaks me just imagining his suffering.𓍯𓂃abusive violent w anger-issues dad and stupid negligent mom:sigh...honestly what can i say about them? Their dad is a BULLY, a beater, a sexist, cruel and vicious man, there\'s nothing remotely redeemable about him bc sometimes evil people are just that... evil. no explanation or backstory needed on why they are the way they are. Their mom though... that\'s a whole different story, and I KNOW at some extent she\'s a victim too, but i couldn\'t care less about her. She makes me so mad, it\'s infuriating just having to read the pages she\'s in bc i know i\'m about to read the most stupid woman on fictional land. I honestly don\'t know how you see your kids being BEATEN, mistreated physically and verbally for YEARS and do nothing but stay around pretending nothing happens... like, you\'re the adult in that situation, do something please!! she\'s an enabler and i dont think i\'ll ever feel bad for her.🌠🏉🏅⋆.ೃ࿔*:･₊•.°.⋆✮⋆.°.•₊⋆.ೃ࿔*:･🌠🏉🏅⋆.ೃ࿔*:･₊•.°.⋆✮⋆.°.•₊⋆.ೃ࿔*:･🏅🏉🌠——⭑⋆⋆⋆⭑——Plot♡\u2060——⭑⋆⋆⋆⭑——I MOSTLY enjoyed this book, it was nothing like I was expecting, and that\'s something I like and appreciate, but at the beginning i was a little bit thrown off knowing that our mc were 15-17 bc i\'m older and idk.. i guess i\'m not used to read from THAT young perspective anymore but i got to forget about it quickly.There were some moments, especially with Shannon, in which i was cringing so bad lol, bc she was borderline clumsy, for no good reason, just to make her seem all so quirky and helpless. And sometimes her attitude was so chidlish but again... she\'s only 15-16 so.. it makes sense and i guess i was cringey too at that age lol.Overall, i ENJOYED a lot of this book, but i felt it too unserious at times and there were a lot of parts that the author dragged unnecessarily and that could have been shorter without affecting the plot. I think this book could have used like 200 pages less and it would still be as good.I still think this is worth the try and for those who feel intimidated by the amount of pages it really flies by bc the writing is very easy to follow and the story keeps you locked in, so.. that\'s it.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""“I once read somewhere that we mature with damage, not with age.” -`♡´-“¨I think I need you for keeps.¨¨I think I need you for keeps, too.¨” -`♡´-“Now, tell me who made you cry and I'll fix it.”-`♡´-3 Stars-I'm undecided on this rating a little bit so I may change it again but I'm going with 3 for now.So let me start with- I was under the impression that this was a YA sports romance initially. I understood that there was family drama and physical abuse the the FMC was experiencing at home but I've read YA that includes heavy topics and this ...where on earth did I get YA from???Fair warning - this is definitely not a YA story and even though I've read plenty of books with violence in them, some of the abuse scenes in this even had me an adult drawing back in horror.I adore Johnny,he is the epitome of a lovable and protective love interest. The way he treated Shannon right from the beginning was so heartwarming and really had the emotions in me stirring.Add the horrible things that Shannon is going through at home with her alcoholic and abusive father along with her dipshit of a mother who is such a weak woman that she basically turns her head to the physical and emotional abuse being inflicted on all of her children -it makes for a compelling plot.╰┈➤Where my issues with the book come in- is in the writing and storytelling itself.I really had to look past quite a lot of things. I know I've said it many times in my updates, but trust me - it's no where near the amount of times it's mentioned in the book.╰┈➤Shannon is tiny. She's SMOL. She's petite. She's pint sized. She's tiny...tiny...tiny.Oh, we get it Chloe. We got it.I just want to understand how can a 5 ft girl not get up on a stool?I'm only 4 inches taller and?? I've never felt like the size of a toddler - lmao.But for real.Not only that but the amount of clumsiness and things that happen really just made her seem even younger than she was made me feel a little uncomfortable. In a way that she seemed childlike?╰┈➤The whole 'pitching a tent' scene.I really had second hand embarrassment and some of the ick with the way things went down with them in that scene.Overall, I did enjoy the story itself and it did evoke emotions out of me.

Percy soon discovers there is trouble at Camp Half-Blood: The magical borders which protect Half-Blood Hill have been poisoned by a mysterious enemy, and the only safe haven for demigods is on the verge of being overrun by mythological monsters. To save the camp, Percy needs the help of his best friend, Grover, who has been taken prisoner by the Cyclops Polyphemus on an island somewhere in the Sea of Monsters--the dangerous waters Greek heroes have sailed for millenia--only today, the Sea of Monsters goes by a new name...the Bermuda Triangle.Now Percy and his friends--Grover, Annabeth, and Tyson--must retrieve the Golden Fleece from the Island of the Cyclopes by the end of the summer or Camp Half-Blood will be destroyed.

Upon the impending destruction of the only haven left for demigods, Percy, Annabeth, Tyson and Clarisse embark on a desperate quest to find the Golden Fleece, the only sacred relic capable of healing Thalia’s Tree and restore its defensive powers. On a separate plane, Grover missing and possibly subject of a fatal destiny. His time running short, or maybe already too late.This was a fantastic sequel. Percy and Annabeth great as always, Clarisse still hateful but scoring some redeeming points, but of all the characters the ever innocent and selfless Tyson was the one that truly captured my heart. Amazing character development. A bit slowly paced compared to the first installment, but still fully action packed. Some epic memorable moments and incredible battles against mythological figures like giants, Hydra, Scylla, Charybdis, Circe and Polyphemus, among others. Luke was also there. And you gotta love the Hippocampi! The ending was spectacular, hilarious, crazy, and terrible. And an absolutely mind blowing cliffhanger to seal the deal.Thalia!*** The movie (2013) was a somewhat better adaptation, at least compared to the disappointing first. Fairly faithful to the book, and averagely entertaining. Thank god Head replaced Brosnan as Chiron! Lerman and Daddario a bit more seasoned and convincing this time. Ambience, pacing and ending good enough, I guess. Nevertheless, despite some things done right, the sequel was yet again overall not convincing and failed to hit all the right spots, and by far. Acceptable enough to be watched, yet not enjoyable enough to be worth it. I love the series, but regarding the movies, I can live without, and I’m not surprised this was the last one to be filmed.-----------------------------------------------PERSONAL NOTE:[2006] [279p] [Fantasy] [YA] [Highly Recommendable]-----------------------------------------------★★★★☆1.

Asombroso desarrollo de personajes. Un poco más lenta comparada con la primera entrega, pero aun así completamente cargada de acción. Algunos memorables y épicos momentos y sorprendentes batallas contra figuras mitológicas como gigantes, Hidra, Escila, Caribdis, Circe y Polifemo, entre otros. Luke también estuvo ahí. ¡Y hay que amar esos Hipocampos! El final espectacular, hilarante, loco, y terrible. Y un gancho final que absolutamente vuela la mente para cerrar el trato.Thalia!*** La película (2013) es una algo mejor adaptación, al menos comparada con la decepcionante primera. Decentemente fiel al libro, y entretenidamente promedio. ¡Gracias a dios que Head reemplazó a Brosnan como Quirón! Lerman y Daddario un poco más experimentados y convincentes esta vez. Ambiente, ritmo y final suficientemente buenos, supongo. Sin embargo, a pesar de algunas cosas hechas bien, la secuela otra vez en conjunto no convence y falla en pegar en todos los puntos importantes, y por lejos. Suficientemente aceptable para ser vista, pero no lo suficientemente disfrutable para que valga la pena. Amo la serie, pero con respecto a las películas podría vivir sin ellas, y no me sorprende que esta fuera la última en ser filmada.-----------------------------------------------NOTA PERSONAL:[2006] [279p] [Fantasía] [Joven Adulto] [Altamente Recomendable]-----------------------------------------------""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""(A-) 80%| Very GoodNotes:High on high-seas hijinks, it's a trial tonal trade-in, shifting style more juvenile, less legend, lore and landmark-laden.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '✅ Reread (July 2024)It\'s been yearsss and the cliffhanger still hits 🤌🤌~•~•~Original review-Sea of Monsters is the most underrated book of the PJO series. I realise there are many iconic moments from this one. This is the book when you really start to ship Percabeth. The slow burn *chef\'s kiss*. The way Percy held Annabeth when they encountered the sirens🥺This book gives you a really good cliffhanger which just makes you want to pick up the next book immediately. The scene with ""Nobody"" = awesome.Also I just want to make it clear I will fight for Tyson. He\'s precious. It was really satisfying to see how both Percy and Annabeth developed their relationship with him. Also let\'s not forget badass Clarisse.

I actually had the urge take this book in my hand with a strong grip and whirl it towards my head for waiting so long to read this series. I just kept putting it off for some reason or other. Luckily I came to my senses.For the most part things have been pretty quiet this school year and Percy even makes a new friend named Tyson, a giant of a kid. Well, this is the Percy Jackson series and things don't stay quiet for long. Monsters come in and attack the gym during a game of dodgeball and chaos ensues, and Percy learns that something terribly wrong has happened. The tree that signifies Thalia's sacrifice has been poisoned and Camp Half-Blood is no longer safe.Riordan has made quite a world here, but that's not the only thing you need to get a good story. Characters areSOimportant and he doesn't forget that. All of them are typically well drawn out. After finishing this one I feel like I know Percy and Annabeth a little better than I did before. We get to see some new characters, Tyson being my favorite and new powers and awesome mythological information. What really impresses me is that it can be funny, witty, informational, believable, smart, suspenseful at the same time without the reader losing the sense of adventure and how much heart all the characters have. What's so cool is that the action never seems to slow down, the action star in me is thoroughly satisfied. The ending is setup well for the next book, and just shows how tricky our villain is. I actually wish I could write a longer very concise and intelligent review about this book (maybe I couldn't accomplish that) but I don't want to giveanythingaway, and really the book can stand on it's own without my help.Most people have read them all by now so this message is for you stragglers who waited so long like myself:GO AND READ IT!I doubt you'll regret it.Added later:Guess what?

I hate it when people do that, but the books are pretty stand-alone and we picked the wrong one when leaving the house in a hurry.Actually I can now better appreciate the cross-book story and it's quite clever, so that's good.This volume continues the mix of Greek myth, modern America, and teenagers. Percy battles through various monsters in bloodless battles where the beasties turn to mist on their deaths and reform years later. We're introduced to his half-brother, a cyclops, and a quest is launched to thwart the dastardly plan to destroy Camp Half-Blood. Various famed nasties are encountered including (& here I'm not going to google the correct spelling) Lastrigonian giants, Stymphalian birds, Charybdis and Scylla, Circe, and Polyphemus. Hermes pops up too.It's all rowdy and fairly random fun raiding not only Greek myth but other periods of history to give us a Civil War gunboat and some famous pirates to boot.The twist is actually a clever one, neatly mirroring the villan's supposed victory with the heroes'.Solid YA entertainment.Join my PatreonJoin my 3-emails-a-year newsletter #prizes..""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '”We did all the standard numbers: ‘Down by the Aegean´, ´I Am My Own Great-Great-Great-Great-Grandpa´, ´This Land is Mino’s Land´.

I mean who wouldn’t want to sing“This Land is Mino’s Land”? (On a side-note: Uncle Rick if you read this, can I please have the lyrics for those songs? *lol* I’d love to read them!!!) Unfortunately not everything is as it seems, and Percy isn’t only plagued by strange dreams of his best friend wearing a bridal gown (Hey there Grover, you’re looking good! ;-P) but also by a few ancient monsters that apparently feel a need to attack his home.But worry not! We all know that for every problem there is a solution and of course Annabeth already figured it out. I guess to have a daughter of Athena at your side really comes in handy sometimes. ;-) Especially if you’re a very practical and down-to-earth person like Percy.”I’ll give you a hint. What do you get when you skin a ram?”“Messy?”See, very practical indeed. *lol* Otherwise he probably would have never figured out that you don’t only get messy but also get a“Golden Fleece”as well.

Camp Halfblood is in trouble and the only thing that’s able to help them to restore their protective barrier is the Golden Fleece.

It did seem a little weird, but, I mean, doughnut shops weren’t really high on my list of sinister forces.”I totally agree with you Percy, but what about the dangers of the sea? Sirens, hydras, a sinister sorceress, a woman with six dog heads or a sea monster that swallows entire ships? What about guinea pigs? Guess they all count as sinister forces. (Yes, even the guinea pigs! *lol*) Well, I’m pretty sure by now you all realized that Percy’s quest is rather adventurous and I admit it, even perilous. Our favourite hero wouldn’t be our favourite hero if he wouldn’t be able to circumnavigate all those lethal dangers though, (pun, totally intended! XD) and in the end …Well, what did you expect? Did you really think I’d spoil you? *lol*Nope, I won’t.

And the character interactions are more believable compared to the first, where we had the 12-year-old Percy killing off monsters from the very beginning. And this is a lot more hilarious, of which I\'m no longer going to complaining, unlike I did with the first. Though it reduces the suspense somewhat, it\'s so much fun to read.

Okay, now let's talk about the book!to be honest, I expected much from this book since Ireally really enjoyed the first book.I'm not saying this book wasn't good. I'm just saying that the first book was better than this sequel. the first book was funnier than this sequel and I just felt I was missing someone and that ' Someone ' was Grover. he didn't get many scenes in this book because ... well, I can't tell you that because it would be a spoiler. Grover is one of my favorite characters in this series, so for me a book without many scenes of him would kind of feel ... I don't know, lack of something. lack of his humor. But I still enjoyed it even though I didn't enjoy it as much as I enjoyed reading the first book.But the plot of this book was exciting and I didn't get bored at all. I always found myself feeling excited and curious about what would happen next, But I still felt like something was missing when I didn't see Grover much.now let's talk about Clarisse, I didn't like her in the first book for what she did or about to do to Percy and she was really mean towards Percy.but in this book, I realized she isn't that mean. I still don't like how she acted to Percy in the first book but in this book, she's ... pretty nice to him and that means she's not completely mean. just read the book (if you haven't read it ) and you'll know what I mean and I feel disappointed to Luke. I didn't expect him to be thisevil.and HOW DARE HE DID THAT TO PERCY!! I hope he gets hurt in the next book. UGH, I hate him.I already ordered the fourth and the fifth book and I have a copy of the third book but I can't read it now! Because if I read the third book now, then when I finish it and the fourth book still hasn't came, then I will be very very impatient. So I decided to read something else and when the fourth and the fifth book arrive at my home then I will read the third book. I SHOULD'VE ORDERED THEM SOONER. *sighs*thank you for reading and liking this review, guys. I appreciate it so much and I hope you all have a great weekend!❤ ❤P.S. : TYSON! I LIKE HIM SO MUCH!

Percy's narration was still amazing!Now Camp Half-Blood's magical boundary has been weakened as someone has poisoned the Pine Tree which strengthen it. There is only cure to reverse the effect of poison. For this cure, Percy has to go on a quest to find it. A fatal quest!I loved everything in this book!!Action scenes were amazing.Chariot Races were also amazing.Every single character in this book is enjoyable and interesting. Especially Tyson is an amazing addition. I really wish to see him in the next book.Ending was shocking. I didn't see that coming. Titan Lord, again, fooled Percy.Overall, I LOVED THIS BOOK!!July 20, 2017""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Perseus Jackson, did your mother not teach you to never accept gifts from strangers?Honestly, I didn’t enjoy this as much as the first book, but I still found myself highly entertained and curious to continue seeing where Percy and his friends would go on their next quest. This sequel is still fun. We follow Percy and Annabeth, as well as Tyson and then other campers and characters making appearances, as they make their way to the Sea of Monsters to save Grover from being married to a Cyclops. The characters Rick has created are the highlight of this series so far, and I know it’s only book 2, but they make the reading experience highly memorable. Percy is still his sassy self, although we are seeing some potential and future growth; Annabeth remains highly strong and purposeful; and instead of Grover, we meet a new cast member, Tyson, a Cyclops who ends up being Percy’s half-baby brother, son of Poseidon. Seeing this trio was amusing, full of uncertainties, snark, and juvenile but realistic banter. Tyson is a fun addition to the cast, adorable and vulnerable but still solid and optimistic. He has the personality and intelligence of a kid still, but he’s witty, loving, and courageous, never letting himself be brought down. He provides the necessary laughter between Percy and Annabeth. I wish the best for him, and I hope this isn’t the last time we’ll hear from him.One thing I’ve already noticed in Rick’s writing is how there is never a dull moment. His writing is entertaining, allowing the reader to become fully immersed in his characters and their journeys. Rick’s writing is never settled down, never dull, and overall has an enjoyable tone. I can easily see how this series was entertaining for kids and teens, showing a world of laughter and humor but also vulnerability underneath it. The journey overall has never grown unpleasant. There is always something new happening, never a moment where the characters aren’t either saving themselves, trying not to be killed, or trying to save others.That said, I found this story less funny than the first book and a little more serious. I’m not exactly complaining, as it never felt boring or overwritten. However, because of the tone of the first book, I expected this to follow a similar pattern. Percy’s character felt a little less witty, even though I loved seeing how his character genuinely came to life as the story progressed. I don’t doubt Annabeth’s character will become a favorite. She’s stronghearted, brave, and trustworthy, all while remaining cautious, and for good reason. Her friendship with Percy has been delightful to see. They’re still kids, but they both have big hearts and want to make a positive outcome in the future. There is also less Greek mythology in this, in my opinion. There are even newer characters, newer names, and more people to remember. Still, they didn’t feel as relevant as most characters in the first book, even if they were just side characters or characters who were there for their appearances.There are a few other characters who I am not the biggest fan of, but they all have their intentions. My friend told me Clarisse has her redemption, and I’m hoping it will be enough because right now, she has me pulling my hair out of frustration. I cannot imagine her and Percy being anything other than rivals, especially after everything that happened with Ares. I don’t hate her, especially after witnessing her dad be his true, cruel self towards her, but I still don’t hold out the most sympathy. There are other characters like Luke, that traitorous child I can’t bring myself to hate for some reason. Maybe it’s because he’s a kid who just wants his father’s recognition and love. Perhaps it’s because he feels abandoned by him. Maybe it’s because deep down after being let down by the good side, he thinks the other side is the way to go.All in all, this was delightful to read. I’m ending this review here, as I am impatient and need to get to book 3 ASAP after that ending.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Ugh, I’m sooooo late with this review (not that anyone has been holding their breath since – let’s be real – I’m probably that 0.01% who hasn’t read Percy Jackson in their life) but hey better late than never, right?Soooo, this book. This book was epic. For a middle school series, Rick Riordan truly went all out. The characters, the plot, the battles, the adventures;the pre-weddingit was all spectacular.(Notice all the vague adjectives I’m using bc I’m a loser who went ahead and read the next book before writing this review so like don’t blame me if I end up monologue about scenes from book 3)Percy and Annabeth will completely be the death of me, I mean they aren’t even a ship yet and I’ve become such dedicated trash, it’s wonderfulI actually spend hours on a daily basis sighing over fanartSo in this book, we continue from where book one left off. Percy is back in a mortal school and so far he’s year has been shockinglyaverage.But the fun is yet to start when Percy successfullythough unintentionallydestroys yet another school (and getting expelled in the process).He lands himself back in Camp Half-blood, which is slowly wasting away due to a curse and it’s up to him and the others to set everything right again by retrieving theGolden Fleece.To sum up, more action, more characters, more fun.Although this series is meant for middle schoolers, my very-adult-self (hush, I’m allowed to say that now) was continuously engaged in the plot. Let’s all acknowledge that events aretotallyunrealistic but I think that just adds more fun to the story.And let’s not forget the hilarity of this series, like the CHAPTER NAMES ARE #GOALS and the characters are so sassy omg how come I wasn’t this sassy back in middle school?“You weren\'t able to talk sense into him?""Well, we kind of tried to kill each other in a duel to the death.""I see. You tried the diplomatic approach.”Anyways, we all know that I already finished the next book and I’m trying to rectify my terrible laziness for writing reviews by pretending I’m doing the responsible thing but like, the next book is waiting for me so byeeeeeeeeeeeeee“That\'s what makes heroes so special.

I read it so long ago, it's almost like reading it for the first time again. There's just something so comforting about this series, something you only find in special books like Harry Potter 🥺. No matter how many other books I read, I will always come back to this one. It never gets old.Percabeth:˚˖𓍢ִ✧˚❝ I'm glad you're not a guinea pig. ❞↬ Quite literally my favorite ship of all time. Percabeth was one of the first ships my twelve-year-old self actually got invested in. They are just so perfect and adorable and precious and innocent omg. In The Lighting Thief, Percy and Annabeth are still pretty young so they're more like little besties with crushes. But now that they're getting older, we get some real moments like a hug or a kiss on the cheek 💙. I could rant forever about how much I love them honestly. My babies.(the) Characters:↬Percy: Persassy, Seaweed Brain... Percy has the best nicknames lol. I think he might have been my first fictional crush. He is so cute and sweet (but also super sassy and unserious ofc); Annabeth is a lucky girl lol. Also, his obsession with blue food! I love that.↬Annabeth:The Wise Girl always slays so hard! She's probably my favorite half-blood. I love how Riordan made her blonde to shoot down the 'dumb blood' stereo type, because she is a genius. Even Percy admits it hehe.↬Grover:I missed Grover is this one! He was always my least favorite of the trio, but I think the show made me like him more. I'm looking forward to seeing in more in The Titans Curse.↬Luke:We don't talk about Luke no, no, no, nooooo...(the) Plot:↬ Ok but Grover in his wedding dress made me laugh so hard, I forgot about how funny this book is. Also the guinea pig incident... poor Percy. Honestly idk how Uncle Rick comes up with this stuff XD. The story line slayed obvi, never a dull moment with the halfbloods! AND THE ENDING AHHHH. Ik I've read Percy Jackson before, but I still gasped.Conclusion:↬ This book is amazing in every way possible; each aspect was perfect! I CAN'T WAIT TO KEEP REREADING THIS SERIES! I remember The Battle of the Labyrinth being my fav, so I'm super excited to get to that one!

This book was absolutely no less from the first, perfect in every way. And, of course, the Percabeth content was the peak of the book 😋.rick\'swritingwas amazing as always. Easy to understand and vibrant with magic. Making it from percy\'s point of view was his best decision honestly, because Percy and his thoughts make everything 10x better. The morals in this series are honestly so huge and powerful for a children\'s book, it kills me. Rick managed to write a book with the best humor and bind in such heavy topics so delicately. The writing is one of the best parts of this book.theworld-buildingissosimple. There\'s literally no complicated names or new piled information, and a majority of the setting was on a boat in the sea so... The relief of not having to know and pronounce complicated and new names is unbelievable.Seeing this different side to the Greek Gods\' family was a fresh change. Hermes and how he tried to get to Luke and get him to turn back 😭🫶🏼. The perspective of looking into the Olympian family is so exciting to me honestly, it\'s what makes me the most excited and interested in this series. It\'s everything. Reading this series is so exciting for me, because I\'m such a greek mythology geek. Seeing all this stuff about the gods and other things is so different. If you didn\'t like the storyline, well, the building of the gods and the Greek mythology kept you there. It\'s the best aspects in the series and one that never gets old honestly.all thecharacterswere so interesting to read about. Hermes to Chiron,you wanted to know more. Everyone was written with more than just looks, they haddepthto them, youconnectedwith them. Rick Riordan has a talent for making us more curious about everything no matter who or what it is. It honestly kills me, I sympathize and am curious about so many questionable characters that it\'s concerning 😭.Honestly, I was kinda scared to re-read this book because Thalia comes back in this one and I\'m not exactly sure how I feel about her. I don\'t remember much about her since I read the series before a long time ago, but I had such mixed feelings about her. I\'m praying I love her in the next book 🤞🏼.Why does no one ever believe Percy throughout this series? it pisses me off 😐. Clarissa is one of my favorite characters, whether she\'s questionable or not. Honestly, she was jut trying to prove herself, just like Percy. Sure, she\'s rude but i love her 🤭.Hermes trying to get Percy to change Luke and giving him advice was everything for me this book. It honestly made me wanna cry. You get to see more of Luke\'s childhood throughout this book and I love Luke a lot, because I get his reasons. The gods treated their children so unfairly. Sure, they\'re gods, but if you\'re gonna sleep with a human and then just ditch her child and not claim them? like how stupid and immature honestly. The gods continued to piss me off throughout this entire series and I honestly wish I could give some of them a fucking reality check.oh my god, when annabeth swam over the edge of the ship and he swam after her. The way he held her under the water 😭😭😭. yall,yall, how do i do thiss?? Him keeping the empathy link even though it might kill him so he would know if Grover was ever in trouble?

The way he would destroypeople he didn\'t like in his thoughts, i\'m crying 😭. The way he loved his friend so much that he would leave camp against orders, sneak onto a ship, jumpoffsaid ship, end up on an island, turn into aniguana pig, turn back human,steal a ship, sail in the sea, and save him from a giant sheep is literally gonna make me cry. Percy Jackson is one of the greenest book boyfriends you will ever read about. I literally adore him sm. If you can\'t like Percy, there\'s something genuinely wrong with you.

I just don\'t really like this series. My two kids would argue to the death with me about them, and I don\'t know why I don\'t like them, I just...don\'t.Maybe I don\'t like ancient Greeks mixing with 21st-century Americans. Maybe it\'s Annabeth\'s recurring refrain of ""oh my gods"" that drives me insane, or maybe it\'s the fact that you can\'t turn 3 pages without Percy being in mortal peril. (Too much adventure is bad for the heart.) Maybe I can\'t buy into so many perfectly-timed rescues-from-nowhere when Percy is just about to bite the big one, or the way Percy goes into every new situation thinking, ""maybe I shouldn\'t do this,"" but does it anyway and it\'s ALWAYS a trap by some monster.

But Levi made his feelings toward Bee very clear in grad school - archenemies work best employed in their own galaxies far, far away.But when her equipment starts to go missing and the staff ignore her, Bee could swear she sees Levi softening into an ally, backing her plays, seconding her ideas... devouring her with those eyes.

To make matters worse, the staff isn’t paying attention to her, Levi is somehow becoming an ally, and she finds herself exploring these new feelings about Levi’s new alliance that has her questioning herself.I’ll start with the good.UnlikeThe Love Hypothesis, I felt like Bee’s support system did not feel forced, annoying, or frustrating. Her RA was a gen-z hoping to get into John Hopkins and continue pursuing her education. While some of her dialogue sometimes felt forced (as if she had to act like someone her age), she still had a lot of moments where she was realistic, funny, and a supportive friend. There’s also Bee’s twin sister, who, although we don’t know much, we can tell they have a strong sibling bond. Most of their interactions are through the phone, but they’re enough to give us an idea of who her sister is. Here, the exchanges themselves didn’t feel forced, and there were no situations where Bee’s inner circle forced her to do anything. Ahn could learn a thing or two from them.And second, I was glad to see this actually take place in a STEM-related location, specifically a lab to conduct the NASA project.Along with science terms used in every chapter’s title, Levi and Bee’s interactions are primarily in the lab. There are also other scientists, whether working on the same projects as Levi and Bee or not, and a clear representation of who is who. There is a lot of political dialogue hidden through romance and comedy (or an attempt, I guess). We see the gender gap between men and women in STEM, the easiness for men, how women are treated, and the general implications of how much more difficult it is for women.Still, I didn’t necessarily like this. More like,appreciated.And now the bad.The writing ofLove on the Brainisn’t any better thanThe Love Hypothesis. In fact, it felt worse. I don’t pay close attention to perspectives, and I’m not the type of person to not read a book because of it, but this is why the first person is tricky. Granted, if you don’t care much about Bee from the beginning, I think this will be a problem throughout the story because Bee’s voice felt sloppy, childish, and immature, as if Bee were talking to us. Sometimes it felt like I was reading multiple diary entries Bee wrote, which felt very in character because of her few immature tendencies. Unfortunately for me, I wasn’t a fan of her from the beginning, so I was dragging myself as I was reading more than 300 pages of boring characters.LikeThe Love Hypothesis, this lacked a lot of depth. There are a lot of plot devices the author inserts into the book but does not elaborate on them.Since we’re pretty much told everything and shown almost nothing, there are many things the reader is told that add nothing to the story due to zero detail provided to make a theory, add a thought, or understand a point.There’s the example of Levi, who has been going to therapy for years because he grew up in a pretty uncommunicative and not necessarily healthy family environment. He’s now a 32-year-old engineer conducting a massive project at NASA. Yet, there is no further detail on this aspect, which is very unfortunate because the author had the opportunity to provide some sort of awareness for an issue that is pretty big around the world. In other words,the addition of a man who goes to therapy can be a crucial point in a STEM book released in 2022. Yet, it’s weak when you only do it to add a personality or character trait for a character already missing unique characteristics about him.He still lets his parents speak over him, dictating what he should be doing instead of wasting his time or whatnot.I mean, the fact that Bee stood up for him felt rather comical than uplifting.Unwilling to stand up for himself, the scene with his family felt entirely irrelevant to the story. I believe replacing it with a scene about Levi opening up more or talking about himself more to understand better where he comes from could have provided a solid addition to get a different interpretation of him. With the lack of backstory, it can be difficult to understand his actions and interpretations of the world, including his closed feelings for Bee that he hides with a cold glance and supposed hate towards her because he can’t communicate his emotions well. Furthermore, Bee is the kind of character who makes herself the victim. When Levi is opening up himself a little to Bee, telling her more about how his family is and how uncommunicative they are, Bee’s thoughts drift to her sayinghe at least has a family to hold on to,meaning at least he has someone and that he should be thankful because she doesn’t. This wasn’t the first time Bee came off as selfish and rude, as if she’s the only one struggling.I’m not asking for an entire backstory on both characters. Still, there is so little personality on both of them that it feels like I don’t know either character well enough to form an opinion. I still think the author copied and pasted a lot from her debut novel to this, such as how Levi feels like Adam, and Bee feels like Olive. There wasn’t anything new presented for either character, and it felt like I was reading a cardboard copy of both of them. There is also the the amount of inner monologue Bee spends commenting on how big, broody, and hot Levi is (I even tried highlighting all the scenes, but I probably missed some), which is also what Olive did in TLH all the time. One or two times is enough, but commenting on it all the fucking time on every occasion that Bee sees Levi is entirely unnecessary, annoying as fuck, and even astonishing.Do you notice someone’s physique and general physical features THAT much?The sex scenes, while there are three instead of one, were still horrendous, giving second-hand embarrassment, and similar in terms of semantics and getting them there. Bee also said Levi is big, to which he responds, “You’ll get used to it.” The author really said COPY AND PASTE! There’s also how this is described as enemies to lovers or nemeses to lovers, and Levi is described as grumpy, yet those two are not the case. At all. I’m not even going to bother going into detail about how this wasNOTenemies to lovers at all or I will drain myself from my constant disappointment.And now, this is where it gets tricky for me.Levi’s pining that we don’t see from his perspective but are still aware of can be considered of the best parts about this.Clear visuals were evident in how Bee described him, whether through his reactions, inwardly and outwardly, or messages with Bee (who both don’t know who they are). Oblivious to the fact that he likes her, Bee’s inner monologue is formed of intrusive thoughts towards Levi, unknown that Levi is acting the way he is not because she’s unpleasant to him but because he doesn’t know how to be around her. I repeat:CAN be considered the best part.However, maybe it’s just me, but I’m tired of the whole “he likes her, so he’s going to act cold around her and pretend he hates her.” I found it immature and childish, and Levi came off as a middle schooler. As for the “hate,” it was never there. It was gone with a blink of an eye. Between 20-30%, the two were suddenly allies and became friends. This had potential, especially since they were in the same workplace. The opportunity of themactuallyworking together and hating it, yet little by little, they start seeing more about each other, was wasted. Initially, I had thought it would be that way, where the two worked together, with the same equipment and whatnot, and they would slowly but surely start seeing each other in a brighter light. Instead, Bee complains to Levi again, Levi complains about what she complained about, and then he tells her he never actually hated her. Tension? Gone. (Actually, it was never there in the first place).Admittedly, I liked the friendship, and I thought they had a good platonic relationship, but this leads me to my next point. I wasn’t a fan of the romance at all. If the romance had more tension, I could have easily enjoyed this much more. I’m generally a character > plot type of person (Besides, who reads romance for the plot? Romance is the plot).But considering I didn’t really like both main characters here, grew heavily annoyed with the constant and repetitive commentary on the hero’s stance, and felt quite frustrated with the amount of depth missing, it was difficult to root for the romance as well.Personally, the relationship felt much more platonic than romantic. See, despite how romance is the genre I read the most, there are a lot of specific points I look for in almost every romance novel I read. Whether the story has the forbidden trope or not, I’m always looking for those tense moments that add to the chemistry: stolen glances, fingers brushing, hands touching. And if those aren’t included, I appreciate it when the author shows and tells how both characters feel (or, in this case, how Bee was feeling), so the reader can see how they felt. With this not added, it’s hard for me to know where the character is coming from because I don’t evenknowwhere they are coming from. There were hardly any scenes where Bee’s feelings were explicitly stated. Even their sex scenes felt like a friends with benefits situation. Their relationship is slow-burn, which I love, but it felt like they were still in their platonic phase because of how slow it was.This will all come down to interpretation and your form of analysis on how you see the relationship, as it always is with books. It’s a subjective manner. While it’s great that their build-up was slow, that slowness felt like it was still rooted in the friend zone, and therefore the attraction the two were developing towards each other felt like it came out of nowhere. Even though Levi already had a crush on Bee, Bee’s feelings towards him could have used further exploration. There are a couple of scenes where they go out, which is great because I’m always a fan of the two main characters spending time together to get to know each other, but again, there is hardly anything new we learn about them. And when we do, we’re left blankly.As for the ending, there’s a lot to unpack (but not in a good way). First, there’s another copy and paste situation, where a random action was thrown in the last 10% of the book as a very predictable situation turns itself in. Not only that, but before that, there was your traditional miscommunication trope added just to create unnecessary emotion and conflict in the story that could have easily been solved if Bee allowed Levi to show her he was serious. Then, suddenly, after the conflict, there’s the epilogue, which in all honesty, I already forgot. If I weren’t lazy right now, I would open the book and take a peek, but that’s unimportant. It’s irrelevant, just like this book.It may seem like I enjoyed this more than TLH, but I didn’t necessarily enjoy anything here. Personally, enjoyment and appreciation or like are different. While I appreciated and liked some things, I wasn’t enjoying anything. I recall pouring my frustration towards people in my social circle more than in this book. In conclusion,Love on the Brainwill most likely be another Booktok hit that breaks the internet, and people will shower these mid-20-year-olds and early 30-year-olds with praise that shows how low the standards genuinely are.ARC provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""Before we get intoLove On the Brain, I would like to take a second and remind everyone that I gaveThe Love Hypothesis5 whole stars LESS THAN A YEAR AGO. I bring that up because my thoughts here are going to be undeniably ranty and I want to re-establish the fact that I have not been, like, hate-reading Ali Hazelwood from the start. Iwantedto love her sophomore novel, but this was one of the most mind-numbing/soul-crushing/coochie-drying experiences of my life and I have to speak my truth.Here’s the short version: Everything TLH is, LOTB is, but more. If you liked the former, maybe consider giving this one a try. Just know you will be reading the same thing twice (five times if we count the novellas). At this point, it’s clear that Hazelwood is not going to take the initiative to break her own mold. Is she unwilling or incapable? Couldn’t say, but I can tell you her books are suffering as a result. So, if you don’t want to feel like you’re on a never-ending merry-go-round of science puns and quirk, pick one of her titles and go with it, then get off the ride while you still can.Now, onto a more substantial review.Bee might have purple hair and her own version of a PSL-obsession (Marie Curie, anyone?? Haven’t heard of her? Well, you’re about to), but sheisOlive. Levi may have a slightly altered past trauma that causes him to come across as cold and unyielding, but heisAdam. She’s petite, so very teensy, just an itty bitty little dust speck. He’s tall tall tall, with Big Boy muscles and the penis of a goddamn stallion. She’s funky! Loves science! He is strong and silent, but also <3 <3 <3 science!!! It’s tedious. If I wanted to rereadThe Love Hypothesis, I’d simply do it and save myself the headache that comes along with this level of deja vu.The first time I read Ali Hazelwood’s rendition of “enemies” to lovers, I thought it was cute. Now I’m fed up. You’re telling me that an adult man, who leads teams of people and is smart enough to launch rockets (or some other equally impressive space shit), cannot physically STAND to be in the same room as the girl he thinks is pretty? Say what you will about Joshua Templeman, but that man toiled feet away from the woman he fake-hated for months on end without issue. Levi, on the other hand, acts repulsed by Bee’s existence and cowers from her touch, then has the audacity to be shocked when his feelings toward her are questioned. Get a grip and grow the fuck up, my guy. She may be a neuroscientist, but she cannot read your mind. And as much as I love shit-talking fictional men, we can’t exclude Bee from the blame. Miscommunication is one thing, but there’s something so juvenile about the brand of confusion struck up between the couples in this universe. If I had a nickel for every time one of Ali’s protagonists decided to operate based solely on presumed slights and imagined beef, I’d have 25 cents—which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird that it has happened five times.Despite not being a Science Bitch (after almost flunking chemistry in high school I never looked back), I am all for writing about women in STEM. I can appreciate Hazelwood’s passion for the topics she includes in her books and the importance of writing characters who are equally excited about them. I also respect her highlighting of issues that plague the field. However, if major twists in your book can be clocked by a dumbass like me at 4%, because you’ve used them before, that's maybe a sign to re-evaluate your process. And, while we’re talking STEM rep—I’m no expert, but every time a female MC experiences sexism in the workplace, is it really the ‘STEMinist’ move to have her man be the one to swoop in and immediately fix everything for her?The sex. God, it pains me to say this. Up until now, I have been relatively impressed with how Hazelwood writes intimacy. Even the novellas, which were disappointing in almost every way, brought some smut to the table that I thought was worth reading. Someone involved is usually less experienced, but it’s not always the woman and it’s never a big deal. There’s mentions of awkwardness and anxiety, shit that may not be HOT, but are realistic in vulnerable moments. Alas, all that flies out the window with LOTB. As if the book gods knew I was going to be scrounging forcrumbsto praise here and wanted one last laugh, but I digress. I’m not ashamed to say, I was jazzed when I heard this story had three sex scenes to TLH’s one. Now I know better. Ali, m’am, I’ve done nothing but love you, yet you subject me to “he traces the bulge of his cock through the skin of my cheek…” FOR WHAT. I had to read about how Bee is “...some kind of fantasy…built to do this…built for [Levi].” At 28 y/o, she sleeps in a twin bed and is able to fit into clothes from middle school. Her vagina is so small & tight (and hairless! she has gotten her “...chuncha fully waxed every month for years…”) that she nearly blacks out trying to fit Levi’s monster dick inside for the first time. I won’t pretend that these characteristics are unique to Hazelwood’s romances, nor were they entirely exempt from her previous works. But, like I said at the start of this review: LOTB ratchets everything up about a million notches. The objectification and infantilization of Bee made me, quite frankly, uncomfortable. It's shoved down the reader's throat in a way that can't be escaped. Maybe TLH wasn’t the sexiest thing in the world, but Chapter 16 would never hurt me like this book did, that I know for sure.That ending. Not sure who gave it the green light, but what NONSENSE. To be fair, the last 15% of the plot poses the least cause for concern within this whole mess. I just thought I’d mention it’s very “I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren’t for you meddling kids!” and that far too much rides on the existence of a believed-to-be-nonexistent cat. I could also bring up how quickly and conveniently everything was resolved, but I’m too busy reveling in my reaching of the final page to care atm, so I’ll let it go.Let’s end things with the one silver lining I can think of: I read an ARC. An ARC, which I’ve had since January, I think? Meaning,Love On the Brainwill have definitely undergone editing between the version I’m talking about and what is released at the end of August, or at least itshould’ve(Berkeley, if you’re reading this, you’ve got some typos to fix). Anyway, it'll be different in its final form. Maybe even better? Unfortunately, I’ll never know.

Probably at one point I didn\'t. When I first read this, I could see the fun in a man being obsessed with an unknowing woman from afar until she notices him after several years of pining, or appreciate the silliness and idealization and romanticization, and look past how dumb our protagonist is, and ignore that the only character I really liked was a flat background extra whose only personality is being scary and mean (much like myself), and pretend that ENDING never HAPPENED...But then five months passed as I awaited the release date.And I read three godawful novellas in that time.And I didn\'t forget a single thing about this book.And not in the good way, either.Bottom line: A life of hatred it is!---------------currently-reading updatesI GOT AN E-ARC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i am never going to shut up about this ever again.---------------tbr reviewali hazelwood wrote one book and in exchange received my undying loyalty'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Happy pub day 🥳I start my review by giving a big applause for the brilliant person who created this amazing cover!

I have to admit, I really loved all of the scientific aspects of this book even more than usual, because BLINK deals with transcranial magnetic stimulation, something I've undergone myself and have never really seen mentioned anywhere else. I might have sent many very excited texts whenever it came up.Okay, but onto what everyone probably wants to hear about the most: the romance.It was so perfect!! Levi is an incredible love interest, and by that I mean I am absolutely in love with him. He and Bee went to the same grad school, where his hatred of Bee was known by everyone, for reasons she never quite understood.

So when she gets the call from NASA to work on one of their helmet prototypes, it sounds like a dream come true. The only catch: she has to work alongside Levi, her archnemesis from grad school. But as she spends more time with him, she starts to realize that maybe they don't really hate each other after all and it's actually something else altogether.If I had to pick the one thing I enjoyed the most about this book, it isn't the romance. Shocking, I know. Rather, it's the writing. There's something about Ali Hazelwood's style, with its blend of snark and humor, that just completely has me in its thralls. Often I would find myself grinning from cheek to cheek, chuckling to myself while Bee held some amusing and sarcastic conversation or inner dialogue. I think it's because she says all the things I want to say, if only I were quick and clever enough to come up with it.And there were so many puns! Science puns, cat puns, Marie Curie puns. I love me a good pun (or a bad one, I'm not that discerning), so I was in pun-heaven.I have to mention the science in here. I don't know anything about neuroscience, but reading this book made me wish I did. I wanted so badly for the technology in here to be real, so that I could marvel at how cool it is and totally nerd out learning more about it. Add in the NASA/astronaut angle, and your resident space-science fangirl here was swooning.In terms of the romance itself, I enjoyed it, but it wasn't my favorite thing about this book. I found the transition from we're-frenemies to we're-getting-it-on to be a bit sudden. It seemed like they were solidly in the former category, and then all of a sudden, they were in the latter category. I guess I wanted more of a slow progression and steamy anticipation than what I got.Still, the coupling of Bee and Levi was a fun one. Of course due to their previous interactions, Bee would assume that Levi hates her. And of course she'd be slow to figure it out, resulting in rather funny misunderstandings between them. However, I can totally see the pitchforks coming out for this couple—how it's completely unrealistic, how there's no way it would take her this long to come to her senses. I mean, sure, it's unrealistic, but that feels like the entire romance genre to me. It always necessitates a certain suspension of disbelief to enjoy, which totally worked for me here. Your mileage may vary.As an aside, I was checking out some articles about the author (I was super curious about her scientific research), and found out Ali Hazelwood is a pen name. Apparently, in her real life, none of her colleagues or students have mentioned her books to her, so she thinks no one has made the connection yet. Ha, imagine that!At this point, I can safely add Ali Hazelwood to my list of must-read authors. I've loved both of her full-length novels (I'm a little iffier on her novellas, but I'm generally not a fan of novellas). I find her writing style to be supremely entertaining and her focus on science and women in STEM to be refreshing. It's always a joy to dig into one of her stories, and I can't wait for more.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:The Love HypothesisThe STEMinist NovellasUnder One RoofStuck with You~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

It had its moments, ups and downs, but mostly it was The Love Hypothesis, Adam and Olive but call them Levi and Bee.Get ready for a lengthy review cause it's about to get wild af!The book starts off pretty well. The pacing is consistent and of course Ali Hazelwood is a talented writer. She can write a book which you'll find yourself easy to get lost in. The concept is pretty good- guy falls for her first, they're pen pals, based in STEM, etc etc. But while she is talented, she is also lazy-because instead of recycling garbage she recycled the adored script of The Love Hypothesis.I went into this book with an open mind. Had no intentions of comparing it to The Love Hypothesis, but as I started making progress it became quite clear that it is theEXACT same formula as The Love Hypothesis.There's just no denying that. It became harder to not compare the two, so do bear with me. Adam and Olive were so easy to like, their angst came so naturally. The side characters were so full of personality.Love on the Brain, on the other hand discards all that. We getBee,who is supposedly super smart and one of the best. Tell me why does she have to be so dumb in the emotional sense?! It was irritating for me to constantly read how Levi hates her, when the guy could not be more clear in his feelings. He actually even said it!! Also, the fact that she kept interrupting/rambling every time the other person talks to her?? What's that about?! I also did not appreciate her inner monologues. It was overly done and felt like a filler. One more thing, why did she need to wear her grandmother's wedding band on her ring finger? That's just weird.If Hazelwood is like that in reality, I would not get along with her at all. Like her character Bee, she continued to ramble on in the last 100 pages. I'm not even kidding 🥲Coming towardsLevi,I admit I hated him at first, his attitude was quite arrogant which I was not a fan of. But once I got to know him, I liked him, more than Bee. Much more.The two have good chemistry and they're cute together BUT sadly, they could not create the magic that Adam and Olive created.I appreciated the occasional humour in the book, I think Hazelwood writes that quite well. I loved the dm exchange on twitter, it brought the book more depth.My other problem was the fact that Hazelwood made it uncomfortable by forcing, yes forcing, situations which became misogynistic when there's absolutely no requirement to do so. For instance- Levi's playlist. Let the man listen to what he wants without creating an issue Bee. He has already displayed numerous times he's not a misogynist. I get it that there are men who are misogynists, and it is a sad harsh reality but you don't need to bring down men unnecessarily. Don't forget the fact that I am a woman myself. I know what my rights are. I know what I deserve. I know how to make a stand for myself. I know what the reality is. I know how us women struggle. But I also know, I don't have to bring down anyone or any man, especially when the person is doing nothing wrong. I also know not to hate on men without any reason. It's just unnecessary and uncalled for.I hope in the future, Hazelwood writes books with a new hypothesis. The same formula can't work every time when it comes to writing. Love Theoretically is already a let down in my eyes, but I'll give it a go for the cover, which I'm sure will look cute on my bookshelf (I'm weird that way) and that will be it for my experience with the author. While I appreciate that she writes about STEM and especially women in STEM- does she not have any other ideas? Does she not want to put in effort to explore and write something newer? Can she not write anything without the miscommunication trope?If you do want to give this a read, please do so. I hope you love it more than me.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3.25 ⭐️ I didn’t loveee the end but oh well I love Ali and this was fun'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'hi hi HELLO, just wanted you guys to know that there is a list of content notes/trigger warnings for the book on my website ❤️https://alihazelwood.com/lotb-cw/'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '⭐️⭐️⭐️.5/5 starsI am still struggling on whether or not to round up or down, so if my star rating changes just know that\'s me being indecisive af.Even though I didn\'t LOVEEEThe Love HypothesisI did enjoy it overall even though there were some aspects I didn\'t like (the over-the-top SA storyline for one) and I especially liked how fun it was to read.The same is the case forLove on the Brain.Overall I enjoyed many parts of this book and it was fun to read! That being said, there were quite a few things that I did not enjoy and honestly, they were a little bit more unbearable in this book than in TLH because at this point I have read FIVE published works from this author (yes I am counting the novellas as published works since it is technically true despite not being full size novels!)👎 WHAT I DIDN\'T LIKE: 👎*The straight up stupidity of the heroine- and sadly, this isn\'t an anomaly! This seems to be Ali Hazelwood\'s signature! Which I greatly do not enjoy! I love that her heroines work in STEM, but honestly is she giving STEM a good name if ALL of her heroines are incredibly dumb and not emotionally intelligent?!?!?! Decide for yourself because I\'ve already decided and the answer is I FUCKING HATE IT ALL. I truly cannot fathom how her heroines (and sadly Bee is included) are soooo smart when it comes to academia, but not real life. UGH. I truly understand that not everyone is going to see that someone actually likes them when there are so many instances where it looks like they don\'t. But I swear, 4 or 5 mentions PER FUCKING PAGE about how much Levi OBVIOUSLY hated Bee was just soooo fucking over the top and unnecessary.*The ridiculous villains- I hated the SA side plot in TLH (mostly because I am very selective about SA plotlines), but I also did not like the villain side plot in LotB. I won\'t spoil who it is or what happened, but when it was ""revealed"" I literally said ""This is so fucking stupid!"" out loud. Because why? It\'s so fucking stupid. I just don\'t think her books need these ridiculous and over-the-top side plots.*Most of the side characters- Sorry not sorry, but Rocio is annoying as fuck. She\'s incredibly unprofessional and cringey. I didn\'t enjoy any scene that she was in. I also wasn\'t too hip on Bee\'s sister whose name I have already forgotten. So many of their conversations were cringe.👍 SO WHAT DID I ENJOY? 👍*This book read very quickly- almost 400 pages and yet I didn\'t want to stop reading. I was enjoying the ride even though it was quite ridiculous at times.*The tease of Levi redeeming himself- we know it\'s coming!! And I couldn\'t wait for it to happen! And I was satisfied!*The sex scenes!- everyone will have a different opinion, but the sex scenes worked for me although I think they had PIV too early. I would have preferred one more scene where they did some touching/grinding before PIV, but it doesn\'t really matter at the end of the day.*The twitter messages!- possibly spoilers so hiding it here.Although I think anyone with two brain cells would be able to guess that Levi is actually Schmac. Anyway, loved this!!! I especially love that there wasn\'t a plotline where Bee had a crush on Schmac. She liked talking to him for sure, but there was no ""Do I like Levi or do I like this internet friend?!!?!"" Although part of me thinks it would have been so delicious if Levi would have figured it out first based on some VERY OBVIOUS sign that the readers picked up on, but of course not Bee\'s oblivious-ass. Anyway, this was good!🤙 WHAT I DON\'T CARE ABOUT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER 🤙*Big guy/small girl- honestly I consider this to fall under the category of ""don\'t yuck someone\'s yum"". Even though it\'s not my FAVORITE trope I don\'t think this feature of Hazelwood\'s books/novellas warrants all the vitriol it receives. Like it or not, she\'s not doing something ""wrong"" by featuring this in her books. (Fight me!)👏 IN CONCLUSION 👏This book is going to get FUCKING ROASTED and I\'m honestly here for it lmao. All criticisms are valid, especially all criticisms of this fucking book.Despite all of that I did enjoy this book...even if I was constantly irritated lmao. I\'ll continue to read books and novellas by this author, but I seriously SERIOUSLY hope she tries something new with her heroines.-------------------------------------pre-ordered kindle version 1/20/22-------------------------------------THIS COVER IS THE FUCKING CUTEST!!!!! I NEED A POSTER OF IT ON MY WALL. 😍💗-------------------------------------Based on the single chapter preview at the end ofThe Love Hypothesis, this book is going to be a favorite. I already know. There is no information about this book anywhere online yet, but what I gather from the first chapter is STEM + You\'ve Got Mail trope. Sign me the frick up!!'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4.25/5 𓍢ִ໋🌷͙֒I enjoyed this so so much, my favourite Ali Hazelwood by far! At the start, I really didn\'t think it was going to be but genuinely this made me smile and gasp, I was so hooked and couldn\'t put it down.As per Hazelwood\'s STEM theme, this book features Bee, Ph. D, a neuroscientist specialising in brain stimulation with a Marie Curie obsession. She\'s a feminist icon, loves cats, has funky hair colours & many impulse tattoos. She\'s invited to co-lead a NASA project - with her \'nemesis\' (by no means is this an enemies to lovers). This book displays how that all works out, in a cheerful rom com type of way with a surprisinglydark edge.There are so many great themes in this book: the inequities of being a woman in STEM, autonomic nervous system disorders, the unfair nature of admittance to graduate school, family & friendship and of course - learning to love after heartbreak. I enjoyed this so much, and I think I mostly attribute it to the science (although I\'m a biochemist not a neuroscientist) and the realities of higher degree research.⋆ ˚☁️ ⁀➴Plot:For a romance, I was surprised at the balance of plot and character driven aspects. I was genuinely invested on how their research project was going to go, if they were going to beat other people to the punch & if it would be successful. There was also a surprising amount of twists and turns, way more than any other Ali Hazelwood I\'ve read so far, which I really enjoyed.Though the romance was definitely in the front seat. Is this my favourite romance dynamic? I don\'t think so - it was very much one of those times where one of the characters is sort of completely oblivious to the feelings of someone else (which I get; me too). It was a little frustrating to read, but it comes from a place of the characters\' self doubt and post traumatic relationship wounds, which is completely understandable. It\'s a very satisfying ending, and I would like to believe something like this exists in real life. This was atotal he falls first; and for a surprisingly long time,romance.⋆ ˚☁️ ⁀➴Characters:Beeis very \'quirky millennial\' - colourful ombre, loves cats, makes obscure references and is everything pro-woman. I personally couldn\'t relate to her, except for her views on romance. She\'s incredibly intelligent and so precious, she just isn\'t my cup of tea. Poor girl is afflicted with a ANS disorder/syndrome of some kind (me too!) and it was nice to see that representation. She doesn\'t back down from stuffy old men being sexist, which I adore.She talks a lot about ""sausage referencing"" - the whole a woman can have a great idea, say it and no one listens but the second a man says the same thing everyone\'s all ears. Very relatable.Leviis our love interest - he\'s a lead engineer at NASA with an interest in neuroscientist. I might be biased, but because he\'s in STEM he\'s instantly more attractive to me. He\'s the kind of guy you bring home to your parents. He\'s calm, stoic, good with kids, thoughtful and chivalrous in a modern way. There was one chapter where I was genuinely shocked at how attentive and thoughtful this man was, I audibly gasped.⋆ ˚☁️ ⁀➴Writing:Ali Hazelwood\'s writing style is golden. It flows, it\'s easy to digest when you want a lighthearted read to break up your dense Sarah J Mass and stuff like that. It\'s just a rom com vibe. It\'s well paced and addictive - 10/10. She also writes just the best men, you can totally tell they are written by women.⋆ ˚☁️ ⁀➴Enjoyment:I really loved this. It was fun, and really refreshing amongst my current trend of reads. I just really loved the STEM elements, and it was just a warm fuzzy read. Her formulaic stories are starting to get to me though.Would I recommend this?:Absolutely! - 100% ˚˖𓍢ִ໋🦢˚︶︶︶ ⊹ ︶︶︶⠀୨♡୧⠀︶︶︶ ⊹ ︶︶︶₊˚⊹♡ reading log:18/06 1:20pmi am enjoying this so much more than i thought i would17/06 5:40pmthere is some totally valid commentary in here about the inequities in academia and i am all for it17/06 1:15pmit sort of feels like all the STEM ali hazelwood\'s are the same story, just different disciplines of science₊˚⊹♡ pre-reading:so I was reading the nightingale - however then I got sad and find myself spending my whole sunday in bed and a historical fiction wasn\'t really making me feel any better, so as a women in STEM I picked this as a light hopefully cheerful read ˚ 𝜗𝜚˚⋆｡☆'}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""Ever since everyone pointed out how much the author talks about how big the men are and how tiny the girls are, that's all I notice LOL. But I did still like this. I appreciate that the author writes about women in STEM and gives them these love stories. In this one it really focuses a bit more on the actual science stuff in the storyline so that was fun. The romance was cute enough, they had chemistry for sure. I would like to read about different characters from the author though because it is a pretty similar dynamic to her first book with the grumpy/sunshine trope, though this time you get enemies to lovers. The ending kind of took a weird turn into this action scene and I felt meh about that but I don't regret having read it! Honestly I just don't think I'm quite as blown away by here books as other people but like, I did like it and will continue reading her books.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '– 2.5 starsi’m sad to say this, but i think my bestie Ali Hazelwood might be a one hit wonder. She wrote imo one of the best debut romance novel and it blew up and because of that she’s just running with the same characters, the same tropes, the same settings, but different names and it failed. Olive & Adam had a certain charm that Bee & Levi are completely lacking.Tropes:🚀 ‘enemies’-to-lovers🚀 a neuroscientist (h) + an engineer (H)🚀 women in STEM & sexist men in that same field🚀 secret pen pals🚀 smol girl - ginormous guy🚀 quirky heroine – grumpy Hero🚀 Hero is a fucking simp, but shows it in the dumbest way possible🚀 ✨\xa0miscommunication ✨🚀 monster dick🚀 praise kink🚀 catslet’s jump straight to the character talk, cause I cannot summarize the plot of this book even if my life depends on it:– Bee Königswasser (h) –first of all, why is this female character last name named after a chemical compound of acids aka aqua regia and second of all did you know that if you translate Königswasser literally it means ‘royal water’ uhm.. why? i know Bee wants to be Marie Curie so badly, but okay that’s one way to shove science down our throat at every chance.besides Bee’s obsession with Marie Curie, she’s also highkey in love with cats. everytime she was making a cat pun, thinking it’s thepurr-fectresponse a human has ever given, a part of my soul shrivels. don’t come for me, i’m just trying to match her energy. 🤚To be fair, there isn’t much to think about. I only remember up until the moment I fainted. Yes, I swooned in His Wardness’s manly arms like a twentieth-century hysteric with penis envy.if you think WHAT, yeah same. that’s how it was like to be in Miss Royal Water’s head. exhausting.– Levi Ward (H) –facts i know with 100% certainty about Levi:1. he’s tall2. he has green eyes3. he’s TALL (the caps are necessary, how else do i highlight his tallness)4. his eyes are really really green5. he is over 6’2 ft and you’ll get his eyes color if you mix blue and yellow together (look at me bringing kindergarden science into my review, Ali are you proud????)6. he despises Elon Musk7. he’s 6’4 ft tall to be exact8. Levi Green™ eyesi understand that Levi comes from a highly dysfunctional family, has never learned to communicate and it really shows. but boy did he give me and Bee nothing to work with at the beginning with his zero communication skills. we are talking about a man who refused to sit next to his crush bc in his word ‘it was hard to think when you were close’. is it cute that he was so tongue-tied around Bee? sure yeah kinda, but it’s more embarrassing, cause they are ADULTS and not 8.what else is on my notes for Levi: while i don’t really remember that much about Levi as you can tell by that list above, i love how Ali writes her Heroes and how they are pining so hard for the heroine for years. he was simping so hard and we’re all here to see it 💅– romance –Levi and Bee romance pretty much gave me Edward and Bella twilight biology class vibesBee wearing her special dress and Levi acting all too disgusted, but is actually simping hardcore on the inside is the same twilight scene but in different fonts.the first half of this book didn’t really catch my interest that much and it was more in the 2 stars area, bc how much these characters were avoiding each other and couldn’t communicate. but once Levi confessed his obsession with Bee over their anonymous twitter chat it got more better. background info: Bee and Levi both have secret twitter accounts namely @whatwouldmariedo and @shmac where they tweet about hindrances working in STEM and where they talk to each other. they are chatting and Levi as shmac has no problem confessing his unrequired love for Bee to Bee.SHMAC: I know what she smells like. This little freckle on her neck when she pulls up her hair. Her upper lip is a little plumper than the lower. The curve of her wrist, when she holds a pen. It’s wrong, really wrong, but I know the shape of her. I go to sleep thinking about it, and then I wake up, go to work, and she is there, and it’s impossible. I tell her stuff I know she’ll agree to, just to hear her hum back at me. It’s like hot water down my fucking spine. She’s married. She’s brilliant. She trusts me, and all I think about is taking her to my office, stripping her, doing unspeakable things to her. And I want to tell her. I want to tell her that she’s luminous, she’s so bright in my mind, sometimes I can’t focus. Sometimes I forget why I came into the room. I’m distracted. I want to push her against a wall, and I want her to push back. I want to go back in time and punch her stupid husband on the day I met him and then travel back to the future and punch him again. I want to buy her flowers, food, books. I want to hold her hand, and I want to lock her in my bedroom. She’s everything I ever wanted and I want to inject her into my veins and also to never see her again. There’s nothing like her and these feelings, they are fucking intolerable. They were half-asleep while she was gone, but now she’s here and my body thinks it’s a fucking teenager and I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to do. There is nothing I can do, so I’ll just . . . not.man was pouring his heart out and how can you not feel for him and smell his desperation? he thought she was married ffs but was still so obsessed with Bee 💀 when is it my turn where a guy wants to inject me into his veins??? 😔– side characters –where is the petition to see a bonus chapter of Rocia (Bee’s assistant) and Kaylee (Levi’s assistant) having intercourse on Bee’s office desk infront of a camera. I was more invested in the side character and what they were up to compared to the main characters. Ali Hazelwood always manages to write the most hilarious secondary characters and they may be over the top with their personalities, but that’s right up my alley.Rocío’s boots hit the floor. Hard. “I love her,” she declares. “She’s perfect. I want her to be my beautiful California Bride with pink ribbons in her hair. I want to give her bubble baths that smell like cotton candy. I want to buy her fruity cocktails with little umbrellas in them.” She leans forward, pinning me with her gaze. “I will wear glitter for her, Bee. Black glitter.”– same old, same old –we talked about the characters that are the mini version of Olive and Adam, but with even worse communication skills. very similar tropes and vibes to The Love Hypothesis. those are all things that are unexciting, but things that can be overlooked, but recycling scenes again is just lazy writing at this point.i’m talking about the same sex scene whereAdamLevi tellsOliveBee that he wants to fuck her and follows with the question “Can I fuck you?” now, listen besties, i love a consensual king as much as the next person, but i can’t believe we are getting the same dialogue twice. let’s not forget that Levi’s monster cock is so huge that it’s tearing Bee’s vag in half .. does that sound familiar? no? okay hint go read chapter 16 of The Love Hypothesis.moreover, i can’t believe we didn’t get a proper love confession in Love on the Brain either.. that was such a minus point in TLH for me and Ali is repeating the same mistake again that Levi is confessing his love for Bee, but Bee is only thinking it when she says she loves Levi in the epilogue.. did i miss something?? it was so unsatisfying.”I can give you nice. I can give you better than nice. I can give you everything.” He smiles at me, full of hope. “You don’t even have to admit to yourself that you love me, Bee. God knows I love you enough for the both of us. But I need you to stay. I need you to stick around.”that conflict at the end of the book was so fucking dramatic and for what 🤣😭\xa0it was so predictable that some white mediocre dude who was good for nothing was going to be the problem for the heroine, but i didn’t see it coming that Guy (that’s the villain’s name i’m not kidding) was literally pointing a gun at Bee and Levi like the Hulk had to wrestle him to the ground｡･ﾟﾟ･Conclusion･ﾟﾟ･｡was this book a disappointment to read after how much i loved The Love Hypothesis? yup. did i expect anything different? nope. after reading two out of three novellas i knew what i would get myself into cause Ali just loves her miscommunication & tiny quirky girl and huge grumpy guy trope. while this is a formula that works out pretty well for now, i hope that Ali will change it up in future novels, cause she has the potential to be better, otherwise she’s just going to be another Sally Thorne, which is not necessary the worst fate for an romance author, but i made my point.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""2 stars🧠i’m gonna keep this review short and sweet, but there were quite a lot of things i disliked about this book.miscommunicationthis is essentially the foundation of this book. i mean, levi (H) ignoring bee (h) for years and basically running out of the room because he thought bee was married isn’t justifiable and is downright cruel.he practically tried to sabotage her career at every turn. when he wasn’t actively sabotaging it, he was making her think he wasto make matters worse, bee furthered this confusion by wearing her grandmother’s wedding ring…on her ring finger. mind you she didn’t realize he thought she was married, well until she LIED TO HIM ABOUT BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP (multiple times and to other people)like when a guy asks her out on a date and levi replies for her, “oh she’s married”. to which the guy apologizes ‘in case he made her uncomfortable’—“Oh, it’s fine. I’m not\xa0.\xa0.\xa0.” Married, I want to say, but it would be a waste of the amazing out Levi gave me. I cough. “I’m not bothered.”what did this solve? i believe levi finds out at around 50% that she’s not marriedthe crazy part was, i kinda missed the miscommunication as i progressed past the 50% mark 😭 the story just felt very lackluster afterendless cringebee is about as cringey as her name. idk why it didn’t click in my head till 25% that she was named after an insect.i kinda lost it when she started throwing out cat puns when baby talking a kitty—“Aren’t you the most purr-fect little baby? I feel so fur-tunate to have met you.”according to bee, non vegans are banned from eating vegan foods! how dare anyone even attempt to!!!“And one more thing,” I snarl into his stony face. “Vegan donuts are for vegans, you absolute walnut.”i can’t forget the scene where bee scolds levi because he has no female artists on his playlist.“Right. That’s why you have exactly\xa0.\xa0.\xa0.” I scroll down for a few seconds. More seconds. A minute. “.\xa0.\xa0.\xa0a grand total of zero female-performed songs on your phone.”bestie, maybe if you scrolled for a minute and 1 second you would have found some 🥸this may be surprising for her to learn but some people enjoy genres of music where women didn’t/don’t make big strides in or are hard to findsmutmost lackluster and lazy smut i’ve read by her. you can’t have levi say one “good girl” and expect me to swoon 😒levii’m still looking for his personality 🤨large, colossal, gargantuan, cumbersomeif you took a shot everyone time bee mentioned levi’s size, you would be dead from alcohol poisoning.A face attached to a large, solid body—a body that is pinning me to the wall, a body made of a broad chest and two thighs that could moonlight as redwoods.i can’t really think of a solid reason why i’m giving this 2 stars instead of 1, but i guess it was tolerable enough for me to finish in a few hoursi swear i've read this book before...oh yeah, it’s called the love hypothesis 😴""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '“You were always in my head. And I could never get you out”.Esta reseña es de un ARC digital que me envió Penguin Random House International.Ustedes saben que quedé OBSESIONADA con lo que escribe Ali Hazelwood después de que leíThe Love Hypothesisy se convirtió en uno de los mejores libros de mi año. Ahora, un tiempo después, llegaLove on the Brainy cumple TODAS las expectativas que tenía. Es hermoso,feel-goody tiene una gran dosis de “nos conocemos, pienso que me odias, nos fuerzan a trabajar juntos, hay tensión, nos volvemos sex buddies, creo que no significa nada, pero en el fondo siempre hemos estado enamorados y lo disfrazamos con mala comunicación y odio falso”.Aquí nos encontramos con Bree, una científica obsesionada con Marie Curie a la que de repente le ofrecen el trabajo de su vida como neuroingeniera de un gran proyecto de la NASA. A pesar de que tendrá que mudarse de ciudad y de que se tendrá que reencontrar con Levi, su archienemigo y persona odiada número uno, ella acepta la oportunidad y se lanza de cabeza a este proyecto. Sin embargo, las cosas cuando llega no salen de la mejor manera, se encuentra con mil trabas en este nuevo trabajo y lo peor es que todas se las achaca a Levi, quien cree que la quiere sabotear, hasta que empieza a notar que él la apoya en todas sus decisiones, que la defiende ante un equipo de científicos bastante machista y… que es incapaz de dejar de mirarla ni un segundo.Creo que Ali Hazelwood ha demostrado que es una maestra en crear situaciones de tensión y en alargarlas hasta que se hacen casi dolorosas de leer. Aunque, claro, en medio de toda esta tensión siempre hay pequeños momentos, miradas, palabras con doble sentido y malentendidos que hacen que todo sea increíble todo el tiempo y que lo único que quieras es que los dos protagonistas se queden encerrados en un ascensor y dejen salirlo todo,if you know what I mean.Creo que una de mis cosas favoritas de este libro fue que, además de la historia de la vida real de Bee y Levi, también tenemos una especie de meta-historia twittera con los álter egos de estos dos personajes en redes sociales. ¡Y adoré que fueran tan tontitos como para no darse cuenta de que estaban hablando el uno con el otro! Es más, debo advertirles queLove on the Braintiene el cliché MÁS ENORME de mala comunicación y asunciones erradas del mundo. Literalmente, la relación-no-relación de Bee y Levi avanza y no avanza porque todo el tiempo están pensando que el otro piensa cosas que realmente no está pensando… o que están casados cuando no lo están, lol. A mí normalmente me molesta un montón este cliché, pero en este libro no me desesperó sino que me dio ternurita.En definitiva, creo que me declaro una fan incondicional de las historias de Ali Hazelwood y, como necesito más en mi vida, creo que voy a leer muy pronto las tresnovellasque sacó exclusivamente enebooky audiolibro porque quiero romance en vena en este mismo segundo.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""“My career gasped for air like a hippo with sleep apnea.”so did mine, Bee. In fact, my hands were shaking just typing this up.You might’ve noticed the one star. Let’s get into a nice, long, multiple-page rant review, shall we? 🥰THE SYNOPSIS.Neuroscientist Girl (aka Bee) is hired at NASA for a special project and realizes she has to co-lead a project with grad-school archnemesis Engineer Boy (aka Levi). Drama ensues.THE CHARACTERS.Bee Königswasser.Bee. Oh, Bee. Before I really rip into Miss Bumblebee, let me provide a mere ✨sample✨ of the thoughts and questions from my head as I read this book:13%: Why is Bee wearing her grandmother’s wedding ring when she isn’t married? That’s weird. No one wears wedding rings for luck. That definitely won’t cause misunderstandings later.16%: Why is it such a problem that she and Levi share the same movie taste? More than one person can like theEmpire Strikes Back. This isn’t kindergarten.34%: I’m bored. These two idiots don’t know how to talk to each other.55%: FIFTY-FIVE PERCENT. Why has it taken until FIFTY-FIVE PERCENT FOR THEM TO START COMMUNICATING FINALLY.70%: Did Bee just have a personality transplant? Why does she like Levi so much all of a sudden?75%: WOAH HOLD UP, did we really feel the need to go from 0 to 69?? WHERE WAS THE CONTEXT FOR THIS??76%: Just found out Bee is literally named after a poem about bees. It’s not just a nickname. I can’t with this book.88%: THAT’S THE THIRD ACT CONFLICT? MISS BUMBLEBEE YOU IDIOT—That’s enough of that.Bee, in case you couldn’t infer it already, is a grad school educated idiot. A professional doofus. Why can this girl quickly realize when Mr. Not-Main-Love-Interest asks her out BUT SHE OBVIOUSLY DOESN’T SEE EVEN ONE OF THE VAST NUMBER OF BLUSHES AND FLUSHES AND SWALLOWS AND PANIC MOMENTS THAT LEVI HAS IN HER PRESENCE NO SHE DOES NOT.In addition to her boneheadedness and the fact that she cries at roadkill, trips quirkily, and faints all the time, Bee also has anger management issues.In fact, now that I think about it, all of Ali Hazelwood’s heroines seem to love fantasizing about violently murdering people. Particularly their love interests.With regards to Bee, she thought about poisoning, stabbing, drowning, impaling, and biting Levi at various points. That’s not even counting what she wanted to do to all the side characters.Clearly, a very stable lady.However, the worst thing Bee ever says is the following, (taken from one of her complaints about the lack of females in STEM teams):“The well-known Meatwave. A Dickspolsion in the Testosteroven. The good old Brodeo.”*ahem* now, Bee, I understand you think life is a war against men, and men have done nothing good in the entirety of human history, but—WHERE IS THE BLEACH. I NEED TO THOROUGHLY SCRUB MY BRAIN PLEASE NEVER SAY THAT AGAIN I BEG YOULevi Ward.Nothing to say here. This man was the Ideal Science Gentleman, which means he was Bee’s ideal of what the perfect man should be and the only one who had a reason for his horrible communication skills.THE ROMANCE.Oh, that romance. If one could even call it that. LITERALLY ALL OF THE TENSION WAS A SERIES OF MISUNDERSTANDINGS.THAT IS NOT ✨TENSION✨THAT’S BEING PROUD OF THE COMMUNICATION ISSUES OF A FOUR-YEAR-OLD.For the first half of the book, the only tangible reason Bee is civil to Levi is because of his big, huge, enormous body and those hulking, massive biceps and his huge warm chest and no I’m not being excessive because BEE CANNOT SHUT UP ABOUT HIS BODY.Like ma’am, please be more creative. Lust for huge enormous manly bodies is overdone and not at all connected to actual love.Take these mere snippets:“Is Levi actually handsome? Or is he just six four and built like the Colossus of Rhodes?”“‘Can’t be taller than six two, or shorter than five one.’I briefly contemplate the notion that neither Levi nor I fall within astronaut height requirements, but for dramatically different reasons.”“I stare at this man who’s six four and two hundred pounds of muscle.”“He manages to sound sincere, as though he’s not a six four, two-hundred-pound brickhouse.”“The walls are too high for me to climb—because I’m five feet tall and everything is too high for me to climb.”wow Bee you’re so small and Levi’s so big and you’re so teeny teeny tiny and he’s such a hulking beast and you’re just a dust particle and he’s a dinosaur CAN YOU PLEASE STOP TALKING ABOUT HIS BODYAnd then after the halfway mark, suddenly she adores him and they’ve had all these cute and not totally contrived moments together and they’re 69’ing three bloody times. (side note to those curious: they’re skippable, but don’t read this book anyway not worth it)THE PLOT.Most of the book was talking about this BLINK project they have for NASA. It was actually a pretty cool project, but I'm here to rant so you may read about it elsewhere.First off, why was EVERY SINGLE male character in this book a woman-objectifying trashy dude? (except, rather conveniently, our main man 🙄) Yes, many men steal research ideas and make disgusting comments about women’s bodies. Yes, science is a historically male- and white- dominated field with a great deal of sexism. But this particular subset of male scientists does not represent EVERY SINGLE man on the planet. I don't want to be lectured about gender stereotypes and oppression and misogyny while reading a romance novel. Those things have their place, but NOT ON EVERY OTHER PAGE PLEASE. I’M TRYING TO WATCH PEOPLE FALL IN LOVE.And another thing: women are not all perfect gorgeous angels. In this book, practically everything a female character does is brave, kind, and accommodating, while everything a male character does is aggressive, bigoted, and hateful. I’m more than happy to call out sexism when deserved, but it's hypocritical to call out sexism against women when, if the roles were reversed, you’d be guilty of the exact same thing. Case in point:“I was initially a bit distrustful of him – his bio says “he/him,” and we all know how men on the internet can be.”Well gee Bee, if you'd said—“I was initially a bit distrustful of her – her bio says “she/her,” and we all know how women on the internet can be.”—you’d be called out as a raging misogynist. But because it was about a man, you’re a feminist empowerment queen and 100% in the right.As a woman myself, I’m calling bs 🤦\u200d♀️*sigh* Anyways, that's it. I know I was a little melodramatic, but I’ve been stuck in this girl's head for 368 pages and need a significant amount of therapy. And venting. So that’s what I did here for over four pages.Thanks for listening, y'all, I appreciate it ❤️Ratings:Star Rating: ★☆☆☆☆If This Book Was a Movie Rating: RRecommendations That Are Better Than This Book:The Hating Gameby Sally ThorneFinding Cinderellaby Kia Amazona""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'this was good but not as good as the first book, i wasn’t that interested in the plot of this book. i did like the romance more but at times i found myself bored also it was really annoying how the characters in this book talked. and this book focuses so much on the science and i’m not gonna lie i didn’t care about that shit. it was fine in the love hypothesis but in this book it was like excessive it took me out of the story. i love that the author focuses on women in stem but she should work on a balance on how she writes her science cus girl i’m not trying to read about that, it was i would go read a sci-fi book, im trying read some characters F*CK okay?'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'edit:a friend just brought to my attention that when Ali said galaxy leggings she was actually referring to black holes and so it’s just black leggings 🤷\u200d♀️ and that is now canon to me.At this very moment i wish i was one of those sophisticated reviewers that had fair but true critiques of this book, and don\'t get me wrong there are very many.but this book gives me all the fuzzy feelings as a women in stem so i am willing to ignore all of them.i will ignore the contstant pop culture referances, the galaxy leggins( i cant even 💀), the very infuriating misscomunication, the constant stream of facts about marie curie (yes she is amazing but chill).i will ignore them because i WANT to like this book and i do i love the premise, women in stem the reality of what its like for them in the workplace, and the online friends (i fucking love that trope so much i dont know why, maybe the talking about the girl with no filter ugh i love it) and of course Levi we love a man in stem that recognises that he is the minority and that we need to bring in other people for different perspectives.i could go on and on about women in stem but i won\'t, i dont have the right audiance here so ill leave you with this:""Nothing in life is to be feared; it is only to be understood"" - Marie Curie (as according to google){previous review}Currently running off 4 hours of sleep, i know i will probably never write a proper review for this so here is my half ass try rn.-I loved this book I really did, It made me happy. No it was not a literary masterpiece but I don\'t care at all, I was kicking my feet and giggling as I read Bees and Levis scenes.-I feel like Ali made herself Bee. They both love cats, star wars - Ali wrote a bestselling Reylo fanfic ffs, and dying there hair i think? (is Ali\'s hair dyed, idk) and they both love neuroscience. I feel like she daydreamed her romance (lets be real we all do) but then didn\'t change herself as the main character and wrote and published it.-Yes, this was a repeat of TLH but in my humble opinion, better, smuttier, and more sciencey (yayyyy stem!!!)and it had engineerssorry i love engineering. But if Ali doesnt break that mold its gonna become real old real fast.-Bees character really annoyed me. Levi had to tell miss gurl he didn\'t hate her like 16 times. Girl c\'mon hes loved you since grad school stfu. I would kill to have a Levi and your like this, bish. And she would not shut up about Marie, i dont even know what her last name was because I skipped over whenever she would talk about her. I mean i get it your twitters based off it but woah that got old quick.- There was a scene where Bee said""okay daddy""and i physically couldn\'t do it. I slammed down my kindle and walked around my room because ew, that was disgusting.-AND GUESS WHAT MY FRIENDS WE GOT LESBIANS IN A STEM NOVEL WITH GRUMPY SUNSHINE \'ENEMIES TO LOVERS\' AND GUY OBSESSED WITH GIRL WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO WANT???-Also wanna say that as an aspiring engineer, it was so cool to see where and how everyone worked together and when they worked stuff out to further the project my heart was full of pride. for people on paper. god im pathetic lmao.-And guess what, we got a \'Good girl"" scene. Good god that was hot. I love Levi with all my heart you know what i cant even tell you how much because I love him too much. Him with children and on her side the entire time and that text message that was like a page long (ifykyk) made my heart ache. We need more Levis in the world. But sadly, we have Tims and Guys I hate Tims and Guys. Fuck them.-also guess what i guessed everything that was going to happen at 5% not to brag or anything. lmao. but i still enjoyed it thoroughly- Also I wanna bring up a point I saw on another review on this book by Kat I think her name was. She brought up that in these books its all about women being independent and being a women in stem and not needing a man. And yeah I agree with that. But then the man is always there to get her out of a bad case of sexual harassment, which yup, i know its a romance novel and there\'s gonna be some saving but like, why cant she save herself. Or she could be going well and the guy comes in to \'assist\' not to \'save her\' per se. You know? I just think that that defeats the whole purpose of the novel.✨women in stem✨ (if you have any rec like this plz drop down below)I know Ali will never see this but if you do please consider my advicepeace out friends, i\'m off to get some much needed sleep.{previous review}I am so pissed that I liked this, i had the most amazing review planned out for when i hated itnews flash i didnt, i loved iti just had 4 hours of sleep because i stayed up reading this.......and i have a full day of schoolbut you know what i dont care this book made me warm and fuzzy insideis it like the TLH?

I read this book in less than 24 hours because I loved it that much. Ali Hazelwood writes such fun quirky characters and I love the science/academic world this book takes place in. I've heard a lot of people say this book is very similar to The Love Hypothesis, and although I agree, I loved it SO much. I actually laughed out loud at several parts which is rare for me.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Happy Release Day to Love on the Brain!I received an Advanced Reader Copy for this book in exchange for an honest reviewI don't give five stars often...If you liked the love hypothesis, this book is here to break it's neck, spit on it and bury it under every white cis male who has ever taken credit for a woman's groundbreaking discovery in the history of human kind.I read this is one sitting and I am so pleasantly surprised.Ali has taken her writing to another level, the feminist way she approaches women is STEM isadorably funny.This book is brainy and grindy and I that is why I love it so much. It is SO MUCH more than just a quirky FMC with a brooding male main character, it's a women's science history book. It's a call out to sexist work environments, it's a call out to standardized tests, it's aSAFE PLACE.I have always been a nerdy kid, liking and wanting to be places women were notsupposed to be a part of, video games, sports, dinosaur/archeology/science camps...It is so refreshing to see that someone out there is doing MORE with their romcoms than sticking to the cookie cutter recipe.I am sick and tired of reading the same stories behind different cartoon covers. AliDELIVERED.There are so many reasons I loved this so much but I have to remain spoiler free, but I will say: this is the first time Ali writes a female main character whose voice and personalityI absolutely adore.The side characters in this? Unbelievable.The amount of times she made me laugh out loud? Uncountable.How hard I swooned? Way too hard.Am I desperately in love with this book and Levi? Undoubtedly.A masterpiece.YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST: The same way I knew People We Meet on Vacation was going to win (and I was right) This book is the new winner of the 2022 Goodreads Choice Awards in the romance category.I have no words to describe how much I enjoyed every single page of this book. I'll dare say this is possibly one of my favorite books of 2022 so far.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""**4.5-stars rounded up**The Queen of Steamy-STEM is back and she's done it again!!Without putting too fine a point on it, I'll just say that Hazelwood's stories are the romances of my dreams. I loved this one even more thanThe Love Hypothesis.InLove on the Brainthe Reader is introduced to Bee Königswasser, a neuroscientist, who has just been offered the opportunity to work on the project of her dreams for none other than NASA.Moving to Houston, Bee gets to bring along her dark-ray of moonshine assistant, Rocío, who contributes her own brand of humor to the story. The project is set to run for 3-months, which could turn out to be the greatest 3-months of Bee's career thus far. She's pumped to get started.Then Bee discovers her co-lead on the project is Levi Ward. Ughhhh, way to ruin an entire vibe. Levi is a huge jerk who spurned her at every turn in grad school.Bee never really understood what his deal was with her, but she knows she doesn't want to repeat any of it at this point in her life.Unsurprisingly, as Bee and Rocío attempt to settle in at their new office and get to work, it seems that someone is sabotaging them. Honestly, it's like Levi isn't even trying to hide it, but the longer they're around each other, Bee begins to see a different side to him.Is Levi softening towards her, or was she possibly misreading him all along? Also, if it isn't Levi sabotaging her, who is it?Y'all, I adored this story. From the very first moments in Bee's perspective, I knew I was going to become so connected to her. I adored the way her brain worked, her passions, her backstory, her insecurities, it was all so solidly developed.Then there is Levi, the epitome of a leading man. He's handsome, smart, industrious, athletic, motivated, charming, sweet and a Star Wars fan. I mean, sign me up.I love an Enemies-to-Lovers trope, so I wasn't surprised that I enjoyed this plot. One thing I really appreciated was that most of the miscommunication between the couple is cleared up earlier in the book than is generally the case.This allowed a better building of their relationship in my opinion. Usually you spend so much time just trying to have characters actually communicate with one another, it can get frustrating. I didn't really feel that here. It felt like just the right amount to build tension without causing annoyance.I also really loved the side characters, particularly Rocío, Bee's assistant, and Levi's cat, Schrodinger, because who doesn't love the cats who star in romance stories!?I will say towards the end, there was some silly drama that felt very eye-rolly for me, hence the 4.5-stars rounded up, versus a full-5. With that being said though, that's a pretty minor thing and it was the only time where I was sort of shaken out of the hypnotic trance this story put me in.I have read all of Hazelwood's currently published works and I have enjoyed them all. I love that she is shining a spotlight on women in STEM and that her characters are all so robust and likable.As with many Romance stories, there is a formula to them, but hey, they work. You know what you are getting into when you pick up a Hazelwood book and I'm here for it all the way.Thank you so much to the publisher, Berkley, for providing me with a copy to read and review.This is my favorite Hazelwood yet and I cannot wait to see what she has in store for us next!!""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Special thanks to Edelweiss and the publisher for giving me an ARC of this book for an honest review.HAPPY RELEASE DAY, LOVE ON THE BRAIN!!! 💕AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! I honestly can’t believe I was lucky enough to get to read this book early!!!! What an absolute dream!!!!Love on the Brain was everything I could ever want from a new Ali Hazelwood and more! It was hilarious and angsty and heart-warming and it read like a warm hug feels.The story is told from the perspective of the heroine, neuroscientist and Marie-Curie-obsessed Bee Königswasser (watch me spell that right on the first try!!). Bee has a thing about not getting pets or forming meaningful romantic relationships because all these bonds will end up breaking her heart one way or another. Pets die, people leave, you get it. I feel like some people will find this part of her a little frustrating, but I… completely related? Lol, I can be the exact same way sometimes, which made this book’s message so personal and beautiful to me.Anyway. We also have the man, the myth, the legend, Levi Ward!!! He’s a grumpy engineer who’s hated Bee since grad school for unknown reasons (OR HAS HE???). He likes hummingbirds and Star Wars and a certain Target dress in a certain neuroscientist and THAT’S ALL I’LL SAY ABOUT IT DON’T ASK ME TO ELABORATE!!!!Bee and Levi are paired up to co-lead a project at NASA, which starts out with Levi saving Bee from a fallen piece of machinery and saving her life. But don’t worry, this changes nothing, they still hate each other, so what if he smells like all her deepest fantasies???Watching Bee fall in love with Levi was so beautiful; you can only pretend someone is not your best friend for so long.I guess my one thing with this book would be that there was a certain plot point that felt a little recycled from The Love Hypothesis, which you can pretty much tell right away. But am I complaining? I would NEVER.I truly cannot wait for everyone to read this book and freak out with me. It was SO SO GOOD!!!!!!!Also, final remark: watch out for 47%. Bring all the tissues. 😫❤️ 🥰'}]"

She’s married to a handsome prince and lives in a legendary castle. But Evangeline has no idea of the devastating price she’s paid for this fairytale.

The book we finally deserve after that HORRENDOUS ending to The Ballad of Never After (I loved that ending so much despite how much pain it caused me) and it is finally here. And so is my review which I have been DYING to write ever since the book got announced, and ever since I finished this book.I have so many thoughts but I don\'t even know how to say them. As you can see, I rated this book 4 stars. It\'s gonna be more than 4 stars, but personally, it\'s not a 5 star book for me.｡.｡:∞♡♥｡.｡The PlotHm...where to begin. I\'ll just start from the beginning. Obviously. But anyways, the beginning of this book was actually a little slow. Mainly because Evangline was relearning everything after her memories were taken, and while I was lowkey stressed out, everything was jumping along pretty smoothly.When Apollo\'s first chapter came around, I literally rolled my eyes because I forgot that he even had chapters in this book. BUT. I was thankfully gifted a Jacks chapter a few chapters later, and that completely lifted my mood. In said chapter, we get THIS absolute gem of a quote that made me choke:“He\'d never understood why someone would watch another person sleep...until her.”screaming.Things started to pick back up literally right after Jacks\'s chapter, which I cannot find as a coincidence, because Jacks just makes literally everything better. I was freaking out and hyperventilating for literally no reason at all for like the rest of the book, and let\'s just say, that\'s definitely an experience.After going back through my updates, let\'s just say, I got more and more unhinged as the book continued on and that\'s true, because the book got crazier and crazier.BUT. based on comments I keep getting, I\'m pretty sure I know why Jacks uses his apples but now I know! All is well.Speaking of which, the epilogue killed me. Not because it\'s cute, because it wasn\'t, BUT BECAUSE OF THE LAST LINE. ""Other stories were brewing in the Magnificent North."" WHAT OTHER STORIES STEPHANIE?? I will need them asap thank you. it did feel a little bittersweet though, because the next stories probably won\'t be connected to any of the main characters from this series and Caraval. I\'m still bitter that Tella didn\'t pop up in a cameo.I just realized I have so much more to say on the plot, but I\'ve already written so much so here\'s my final comment on the plot: this book felt a lot more romance heavy than the others. There was just this super weird vibe around the book, as if it had lost all the magic. Don\'t get me wrong, I loved the romance, EvaJacks are my babies, but one of the reasons I love Caraval and OUABH so much wasbecauseof the magic, and this book just seemed to lack it.“She was the moth and Jacks was still the flame.”🤭｡.｡:∞♡♥｡.｡The CharactersMy beloveds. My babies. My world. My everything.Ok, so with Evangeline, she\'s a really good main character, but the thing is, I hate her because I want to be her. I have issues, thank you, I know. Pushing that aside, she is a really good main character, because she makes....semi-rational decisions? Who am I kidding, Evangeline is such an idiot sometimes. There, I said it. She wasn\'t as much of an idiot in this book as she was in the last one, but she kept taking unnecessary risks that had me smacking my forehead because she could literally die. Her main character role saved her though. Other than that, I really like her.Jacks. Prince of Hearts. Archer. Jacks of the Hollow. I will be the Fox to his Archer any day, where can I find the sign up sheet? In all seriousness, I love Jacks so much. I used to hate him in the Caraval series when I first read it (LOOK it was only because I liked Tella and Legend together, all right?) but Jacks is now my bae and I am so sad that we won\'t get to read anything more about him. Jacks is the king of morally grey characters, though I will be honest: I liked him more when he was mean to Evangeline than in the end and they were all lovey dovey. I\'m messed up like that, I like the enemies before the lovers 😭 In my review of The Ballad of Never After, I did a section where I listed some gems that came out of the Prince of Hearts\'s mouth so I will do that again, the ACFTL EDITION:“Please, Little Fox, remember.”hehe I think I cried at this part.“How can I make you understand,” he growled, “you and I together don\'t end well. We just end.”Preeetty sure I cried here too. Jacks sure knows how to make me cry.“This isn’t just for now, it’s for always, Little Fox.”We love a lovesick JacksAnyways, the other characters were pretty good too:Apollo deserved every single last thing that happened to him 🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳LaLa and Chaos happening WHEN??? That one scene had me giggling so bad. Oh my gosh I NEED A BOOK ABOUT THEMAurora can go eat rocks 🫸 ⛰🤸🏼\u200d♀As usual, if I forgot any side characters, they don\'t matter or aren\'t important or relevant enough for me to try and remember them 🫶“Once upon a time, a girl who believed in fairytales stole the heart of a prince who had sworn to never love.”｡.｡:∞♡♥｡.｡The RelationshipWe have finally reached this point.As I said before, this book was super romance heavy, with so much denial, pining, angst, and longing. Despite all of this, I still wish there was more magic.But anywho, Evangeline and Jacks\'s story is so good, I can\'t even. Like the forbidden/enemies to lovers was so well done. Every time Jacks kept denying her out of love for her made me die and then buried me underground and put a headstone above my grave.The ending brought me back to life though, so I\'m all good now.I talked about a few plot holes I thought I saw here, but apparently I wasn\'t paying much attention, sooo when I\'m less occupied I will talk much more about EvaJacks because they are perfection.Anyways, I had to rant about that, but I love Evangeline and Jacks so much, and WHEN THEY FINALLY KISSED I LITERALLY SCREAMED BECAUSE I\'D WAITED SINCE BOOK ONE FOR THAT MOMENT. Though I\'m ngl that kiss was PATHETIC, I need more.“He gritted his teeth. “Being yours does not make you mine.”I distinctly remember opening my mouth in shock, closing the book dramatically, and then proceeded to roll around on my couch after hearing that.｡.｡:∞♡♥｡.｡Overall, this book was as good as I expected it to be, I just wish it had exceeded my expectations though!EvaJacks for life until the day I die.4.3 stars“He wanted her to look at him, just once, and know him the way she had before.”<><><><><><>update: y\'all i just read the bonus epilogue in the barnes and noble one and i\'m gonna cry, i\'m literally gonna buy the book just for thatwhat. i don\'t even....the ending tho (for reference, this is the normal epilogue, i have NO idea what the epilogues are for the other copies, like the barnes and noble exclusive and whatever the other ones are but if y\'all know them feel free to tell me). it made me mad but also made me SO excited at the same time.rtc!!<><><><><><>edit 10/24: happy release day! i initially thought my book was coming in november, but now that it\'s shipped it might be coming tomorrow! <3EDIT ON THE SAME DAY AS THE LAST EDIT: I JUST REALIZED THAT THERE WAS A SYNOPSIS I\'M SO OBLIVIOUS.

The Ballad of Never After was much better than this. But still, I enjoyed this a lot.This was just as engrossing as the previous books but it lacked the magic and hopefulness of previous books.There wasn\'t much plot. Also, why did the characters just disappear? Where is Luc? Where is Marisol? Are they alive? Are they dead?Jacks and Eva\'s scenes were good. But strangely enough, I feel like there weren\'t enough of them. They had much more interactions in the previous books. I expected more scenes.Apollo just ruins everything. He\'s such a one-dimensional character. Even after reading his POV, I couldn\'t connect with his character at all. He was sooo boring.This also felt quite underwhelming and rushed. I don\'t know, there was just something off about it.I thought it would be difficult to get back Eva\'s memory. But it was so easy and it took no effort from Jacks and Eva at all. This is an issue since this is one of the main conflicts of this book. Just interacting with Jacks brought back her memories. That\'s it? It\'s that easy?After so much build-up, I expected a better first kiss between Eva and Jacks. It wasn\'t up to the mark. The biting scene at the end of the first book was much better than this.Jacks is also a villain, correct? So why didn\'t he fight for Eva? I never expected him to just give up. He always gives up and Eva has to run after him to make progress.I needed an epic love confession from Jacks but alas that did not happen.Jacks is still a Fate. Eva is still a mortal. So she\'ll just die while he spends his eternity mourning her?Apollo was a horrible villain. He wasn\'t intimidating at all. He was quite pathetic tbh.I felt like Jacks\' personality completely changed in this book.Jacks used to be a very mercurial character. He could be both cruel and kind at the same time. He was also very flirtatious and charismatic. He stopped being mischievous and teasing. Like his interactions with Eva completely changed. He was more sober and honest in this book which honestly gave me a whiplash.He lacked the magnetic charisma that was so apparent in the previous books.I wanted so much more angst. I wanted to see some pining. I wanted to see some unrequited love. I wanted drama.I wanted Jacks to realise his mistakes and grovel for Eva.I wanted Jacks to change for the better, that\'s true, but I still wanted him to remain the same at the core. I could sometimes see flashes of the old Jacks in this book but that\'s it. I fell in love with the old Jacks who was a moody bastard.Also, I have to say I\'m disappointed by Jacks\' role in this book. He was hardly present and mostly stayed in the background. He felt like a side character. I wish we learned more about his backstory.I think Jacks\' pov wasn\'t needed at all because it ruined the mystery and enigma of his character. It could have been good had it even been written properly.Apollo and Aurora took way too much space. That space should have been given to exploring more of Jacks and Eva\'s dynamic.Everything wasn\'t explained and some loose ends were left untied. The ending too felt rushed and anti-climactic.1) Why does Jacks eat apples? What does the colour of the apple signify?2) How is Jacks able to talk telepathically to Eva?3) Eva still owes Jacks a third kiss according to their bargain. What about that?And so many more questions remain.I think the main reason this book felt so weak is because The Ballad of Never After was just perfect. The pacing, plot and romance were done perfectly. And reading this book has only increased my appreciation for The Ballad of Never After.Ratings-1) Once Upon a Broken Heart- 3.5/5https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...2) The Ballad of Never After- 5/5https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...3) Curse for True Love-2/5Pre-release thoughts-""I\'myourmonster"".Ahhhhhhhhhhh, I\'m dead.

It\'s too far away.I need an ARC like right now.Edit- The summary and cover are here! The cover is gorgeous. All I can say is that Eva deserves better. The poor girl has suffered enough.

I needed more of Jacks😭😭❤Am satisfied with the way it ended and so glad I read this series.I stand by my words that this is far better than Caraval.The world building, the characters, the plot and romance work so brilliantly in OUABH comparatively.Not saying this was a perfect book, but am so happy I read it. The emotions I felt especially in the last few chapters will have me thinking about it for daysss.I believe while the series was carried by Jacks. This book in particular was carried by Apollo, especially in the first half.The first half was slowish compared to the second. The rush, the romance I felt in the second half made me wonder if I missed out on something in the first 50%.As Evangeline is trying to figure out her reality and to gain her memories back (which she should have been more concerned about) we seeApollocome to terms with what and who he really is. I loved his dark twisted persona. Sure he annoyed me a lot but to see how deluded one can be or what all crazy things obsession can make one do, was so interesting to read.Evangelineseemed incomplete without Jacks. Maybe it was intentional or it\'s just my perception but before Jacks came into the picture, she was so lost. Also, bestie could have put in more effort into gaining her memories back lol.Jacks...Where do I even start? I felt the lack of him. Firstly, he made an appearance after 10 chapters and when he did it came across as cameo appearances for the whole first half. I missed him, terribly. Maybe that is why the first half seemed slow to me. His charm, his love for his little fox is EVERYTHING! The angst he feels was so well written. I needed more of him. His character had so much to say, so much to explore and I believe it kinda got lost in the rush.""You shouldn\'t stare at me like that.""""Then how should I stare?""""You shouldn\'t stare at me at all.""Theromance deserved more pages.I feel like the majority of the time was left exploring how bad Apollo got, that he stole the limelight from the two main characters. The romance at the end came across as rushed. But those few moments that we got, I LOVED it. Absolutely adored it. I won\'t be forgetting about it, believe me.The reasons why this is not a 5 star read for me-1. Am not sure how I feel about the multi pov.Sure it was interesting but it didn\'t really do anything writing wise. It still came across as I was reading the book from Eva\'s pov. Apollo\'s pov was interesting at first, but soon grew old. I got he was dark and was doing his dark business but at the most it should have been like eight chapters. Had the book had more of Jacks pov I would have preferred it more. Jacks pov was also written similarly to Eva\'s. And did I mention I felt the lack of Jacks? Cause I truly did.2. The last 20% of the book was rushed.I would have enjoyed it even more had there been 50-70 pages more. Like the slow burn had been going on for two books and was eating me alive and to rush past it as if we\'re all on a sugar high was not an ideal decision imo. The action sequences could also have used a little more time considering how Apollo went in his lunatic mode.Theendingwas sweet. I know I said it was rushed but only cause I wanted more. I don\'t think I\'ll be over Eva Jacks anytime soon. And correct me if I am wrong but it seems like we might get another spin off? I hope it\'s Chaos\' turn this time 🤭""Once upon a time, there was nothing but kissing, and everything was perfect.

(i’ve heard that take and i can’t bring myself to accept it, there’s a limit for how much u can leave open ended and there was A LOT in this book.)spoiler alert !!let me elaborate on this take - i saw this tiktok talking about how there were so many questions bc it’s metaphorically supposed to represent the story curse and how no one truly knows what happened, in the case of the valley arch and what happened to the valors themselves. however, i feel like it would’ve been suitable had it not been the last book in this series. this is very conflicting to rate bc on one hand i feel like the romance delivered but on the other hand it feels like the plot wasn’t completely thought out. and i did expect so much more from the romance still. jacks loved evangeline so much that he rewrote history but we still can’t get a love confession out of him? 😭😭end of spoilersi’m not gonna be the first to admit i love stephanie garber’s writing. i’ve been very vocal about it ever since i first read her other series ‘caraval’ earlier this year. i don’t have a problem with her writing, i think that it can be very magical and i’m glad it hasn’t changed much. one thing that has changed is the plots of her books. when i read the caraval series, the romance stayed a subplot but with this series, everyone fixates on the romance and i think stephanie garber did the same. at the end she doesn’t clear anything up and i think it might be a way to appeal to the audience bc let’s admit - a lot of ppl read fantasy for the sprinkle of romance.i had a few problems with caraval, but overall i loved it and it was very magical. i will stand by this - i love caraval for the magical world building, where the world goes more into depth and is much more magical, and i love ouabh for the romance. don’t get me wrong, the romance in caraval was almost impeccable. however the characters and their background in this series varied very differently. there was so much depth to these characters and jacks was so much more mysterious. his backstory and everything had me bawling. this is why i truly wanted a better ending for evajacks. i feel very conflicted about this book bc i love the characters so much.unfortunately there are going to be spoilers for the rest of this review. i cannot express a lot of my thoughts without mentioning spoilersthe 2 main villains in this book were aurora and apollo. and like i mentioned before, there was no clarification for the other “villains” in the previous books. i am so confused why we never find out what happens to all the other villains in the other books. marisol and tiberius had absolutely no role. she leaves it open ended in the other book about tiberius and we never find out what happens to him but apparently in this book we don’t find out either!! even luc was mentioned once but he never once appeared. it felt as if stephanie garber thought it would be good if she introduced a new villain rather than addressing the previous ones but no!! i expected tiberius to make his comeback but he was only mentioned a few times in the beginning. the fact that he was pretty much all talk no action is prominent in this book lmaoo. and marisol wasn’t even mentioned. does she just rot in jail..? either way i have hope for stephanie garber. she is still one of my favorite authors and even though i didnt like this book as much, her writing shows promise and i hope that it only improves from now.my thoughts:i’m ngl i have mixed feelings about chaos, or castor. i felt so sad after that ending with evangeline last book (like everyone else ofc) but i wonder how chaos would’ve reacted if he found out he killed eva. he seemed apologetic in the last book but he ran away (probably bc of fear). but this book he’s helping eva bc he believed jacks is going to make a huge mistake. i think chaos is overall a good person (even if he went on a whole mf blood rampage 😭😭) but i don’t blame him after he was forced to wear a helm.And he loved her.He loved her.He loved her.He loved her.He loved her so much he’d rewritten history. He’d given up what he had believed was his only chance at love. And now he had finally broken the spell that he never thought he’d escape.jacks has my whole heart. don’t u dare try and start with him not deserving a happy ending he has been through so much and he deserves the world. he’s been through so much pain, and when he talked about how he felt whenever he thought about how evangeline died i lowkey teared up 😭💘 and when he told her oh my god i was dying. that entire scene is engraved into my brain now. HE ALSO KEPT HER NOTE ABOUT HIM CLOSE TO HIS HEART everything he does is just perfect and amazing<33 every single little detail is forever engraved in my heart.evangeline has been everything throughout this entire series. her dumb decisions kept the book entertaining i’m not even gonna lie. but also her love confession to jacks had me sobbing my eyes out it was so sweet. she has been through so much and i’m so so happy she ended up with jacks. she has been through so much and i love how she learned not to be as naive for the most part. she also learned to be more sassy and stand up for herself her character development has been everything. and her slapping apollo after she got her memories back was QUEEN SHIT 👏👏 eva is my girl 4eva and i absolutely love her. even if she was delulu at times but who isn’t? honestly i love how she still had so much hope but didn’t feel like it was enough like omg girl 😭😭 i felt so bad for her.i feel like this book went completely off script. it introduced new villains (besides apollo), didn’t even clarify anything in the previous books, and the ratio of romance changed drastically. i wanted more angst, more JACKS (!!), and a much more deserved ending. i feel as though she just forgot about the other books and decided to change it up. there was so much angst in the previous books and i thought that it would build up in this book into a huge love confession of jacks part but nope. this does not mean i like jacks any less. these characters mean so much to me and i’m happy that they ended up together.there are spoilers for the caraval series mentioned in this paragraph!!the least disappointing aspect was the romance. but that’s not to say there was no disappointment bc my expectations were through the roof after tbona. there were sprinkles of it which i didn’t mind bc it’s a fantasy book, it’s not always going to focus on the romance aspects. but i still don’t understand how their relationship is gonna work with jacks being immortal and evangeline being a human. i mean dante gave up his immortality for donatella 🥹 i rlly expected a grand gesture from jacks, or anything. the best we got was an “i love you” and even though im happy he said it, it was the bare. fucking. minimum. and it hurts me to say that, trust me. the romance was through the roof with this series, but it drastically changed in this book. their love expanded to every universe and we couldn’t even get a love confession out of jacks? i will never get over that.the plot twist about the truth of jacks curse? i’m ngl my heart broke a little after hearing donatella never loved him which was why she survived his kiss. this is not me in any saying i ship them. but when you think about their history and how it applies then knowing the info now, it makes me feel for jacks. he dyed his hair dark blue, it was clear he was heartbroken. and to learn she never had any feelings for him made me feel a bit of nostalgia. also i have another question - does jacks ever find out the truth of his kisses and how they’re only deadly if someone who will never love him kisses him..?the ending with apollo becoming part of the tree actually made me laugh. another thing that has me laughing was how stephanie garber talked in an interview about how the tree on the cover is important in the book AND ITS LITERALLY THE TREE APOLLO GOT TRAPPED IN 😭😭 she rlly knows us!! i’m so glad he got what was coming to him. that scene frustrated me so much and I’M SO GLAD JACKS GAVE HIM WHAT HE DESERVED!! i waited 2 books for jacks to finally punch apollo and it happened, and i’m so satisfied with that !! and him cursing at apollo had my entertainment reaching its peak. i will say she had me in the first few chapters feeling sympathy for apollo but that quickly went away after everything happened. i’m still upset he killed the guards that only followed his command ☹️—the rest of this review is going to be talking about things that were mentioned/i still had questions about after the ending.would you guys believe me if i said this book was going to previously by 4.5 stars? maybe u won’t, but it’s true. during the beginning, it was rlly slow bc apollo made so many appearances and i was bored out of my mind. but every time jacks showed up it made everything better. at one point, i was contemplating on giving it 4.75 stars. can u imagine my disappointment at giving it the rating i’m giving it now?probably notbut the ending was disappointing. maybe it was just me idk but it isn’t even about the apples as much.speaking of the apples, i didnt mind that as much simply bc she explicitly stated that we would know, and even addressed it which was what i wanted the entire time. if she addressed any of the plot holes, i would’ve been happy. the point of a finale is to wrap everything up and maybe if she wrote another book in this series i’d be happy but this is the end of THIS series so i don’t get why so many things were alluded. the fan theories for the apples have me squealing, i’m kinda glad she didn’t explicitly state it simply bc letting us gather our own conclusion lets us be delulu.another thing - the broken heart scar? i don’t understand why it was never used. was it just a way for eva to sense whenever jacks was nearby since it glowed? i expected more from that. i read the bonus epilogues, and it’s clear that stephanie hasn’t forgotten about it. she mentions it but doesn’t even tell us what’s gonna happen. i really expected something when it was first mentioned in the beginning while i was reading this book. i thought the mention of the scar was going to be foreshadowing but i was disappointed to find out it wasn’t. it’s basically used as a tell tale sign that jacks is nearby.something i’m curious about is how evangeline didn’t die when she kissed jacks. i think the obstacle of apollo helped show how he would meet his end eventually but also i think it helped show that there were other forms of consequences? idk i can’t wrap my head around the fact that it was so easy for them to finally kiss after not kissing for over 2 books. there’s no confirmation, just guesses evangeline has made which makes it all the more confusing. she talks about how his love might help break the curse but i wish stephanie garber confirmed at least something. i finished reading and i honest to god had to think about this book for a long time. it was so bittersweet finishing this series. but the scene where jacks had a scare and he was scared she was dying but she just forgot to breath was so cute i was laughing through my tears at that 🥹🩷i’m disappointed lala didn’t end up punching aurora, which would’ve been fully deserved. we don’t find out anything ab lala besides the fact that she was left alone w aurora after eva left to stop jacks. and it’s clear that she wasn’t punched since she was able to leave lala and distract jacks from finding evangeline. i wonder what’s gonna happen with lala now that she’s done her part helping eva find jacks in their last quest? i feel like it was only a happy conclusion for evajacks and not anyone else who helped them along the way. also i’m so sad she didn’t get a happy ending even after meeting her true love. she truly deserves one and i hope stephanie garber does end up writing another series for her.ˏˋ°•*⁀➷once upon a broken heart - 4.5 starsthe ballad of never after - 4.5 starsa curse for true love - 3.5 starspre-reviewi can’t believe i finished this series. i just know i’m gonna have the biggest hangover over these characters and the world stephanie garber has created 🥹 rtc soon 🤍 but for now i just have to say ‘say don’t go’ by taylor swift is soo evajacks codedreading reviewi’ve been waiting for this day for FUCKING FOREVER and i’m so excited!!pre-read review3 DAYS LEFT!! and i’m going crazy !!!after reading tbonano words will ever describe how badly iNEEDthis book. i understand everyone’s pain now. i desperately need evajacks to be endgame and i’m not accepting anything else.before reading tbonai manifested that this book would come sooner and instead the date levitated farther away'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'My heart is broken, and not for the right reason.This was my most anticipated read and I\'m really disappointed, and it\'s not even because my expectations were too high. I love Stephanie Garber and I would read anything from her since I love the way she tells stories. And this story was not it for me unfortunately!Like this is the last book, so many loose ends to tie up and so many juicy secrets to finally discover, and somehow it was so boring 😭 half of the book is flashbacks as Evangeline is busy ✨️remembering✨️ and it\'s often just PARAGRAPHS cut and pasted from TBONA or OUABH. Maybe it\'s because I read both so recently, but it felt repetitive really quick.There was no clear plot. I don\'t know where the story was going half the time and like something would happen and I\'d think, okay let\'s go!!! but then that plotline would just randomly be abandoned??😭 We never see Luc, Apollo doesn\'t continue trying to woo Eva for an heir and instead starts killing people unprovoked?? Why is Castor just killing people?? What happened with Robin and Lala??? Byron and Petra?? WHERE IS MARISOL? That Garrick guy?? I feel like so many things were introduced but weren\'t properly fleshed out that I don\'t see the point in mentioning it in the first place?? The most offensive was with the last heart scar, SO MANY POSSIBILITIES. Garrick and his posse hunting Jacks and Evangeline owes him a debt, like that\'s SPICY TEA. But then it\'s never important again 😭 it\'s just so frustrating!!Like I said, I thought half the book was slow and boring and awfully repetitive and the only thing I LOVED DEEPLY was Jacks’s POV and anytime he was actually on the page. Mind you, my prince only had 5 chapters 😭😭 The evajacksie fandom always joke that Jacks is so mysterious (and he is!!!) so finally learning about him was the highlight!!! The pining for Evangeline in the early chapters, UGH PURE GOLD!!! I wished his story wasn\'t just lightly brushed over and I wished he could have been the one to tell Evangeline everything instead of just hearing it from Castor, LaLa and Aurora. I think that plays a role into why it just felt so disconnected. And then, I don\'t get Jacks motivation at all. At first, yes he\'s training Eva so she doesn\'t die, then he wants her to get her memory back so bad...? I dont think I caught why?? Then he wants to keep her away so he doesn\'t hurt her... okayyy, then why did he come in the first place?? Why did she need her to remember?? It felt very whiplashy😭Still, Jacks was the best character. Everyone else felt cartoonish. I was upset at most of the plot twist because COME ON!! It\'s the last book and THIS is what you give me😭😭 It felt so cheap?? Also!!! How did Jacks become a Fate? Aurora\'s curse?? No, LaLa said he CHOOSE to be one and he said it was so that Castor wouldn’t be alone. Then how did it actually happen? The Tree of Souls? Who did he sacrifice to be immortal then? And from Caraval, didn\'t that lady (cannot remember her name) and the Fallen Star create the Fates???😭😭 Like, I shouldn\'t be having this many questions in the LAST BOOK.My thoughts are everywhere, but I don\'t think we needed this book. Yes, all the EvaJacks fluff was my LIFE but it could have been a novella😭 we could have had like a story of the North type thing to just tell us everything about Jacks past and how he\'s in love with Evangeline. But half of this book felt like fan service, and the other was boring and uneventful plotlines.IT\'S JUST SO FRUSTRATING!!!! We could have deleved into the Valors more!! Aurora literally being the one to curse Jacks shouldn\'t have just been a passing line!! We could have cut down half of the Evangeline ✨️remembering✨️ scenes and Apollo being unhinged to go deeper into that storyline. But instead, it was rushed and glossed over ???? There\'s just something off about this book. I dont know, it doesn\'t have the essence of Once Upon A Broken Heart.Stephanie did say she rewrote it, but I honestly would have preferred it if she postponed the release longer to make it flow better because right now it\'s clunky and feels like a shell of a story. It\'s just upsetting because Stephanie had SO many options to make this the greatest love story of all time and it just fell flat💔���🏹🍎🦊[27 October 2023 ]UPDATE on this! Firstly, no one ever reads my reviews so I wasn\'t expecting anyone to see this or agree with me but omg!! YOU GET ME😭There\'s been a lot of discourse on evajacks twitter and I wanted to share more of my 2 cents🥰 obviously reviews are for readers and people should NOT be going under Stephanie Garber\'s Instagram posts and not only spoiling the book for everyone else, but also complaining about how much they hated it??? Hello???That being said, I don\'t think it\'s fair to be upset at anyone who criticises ACFTL and shame negative opinions just because Stephanie worked hard and we\'re not writers so we don\'t know anything 😭 Please be serious. This series is my favourite and it literally hurts that I didn\'t love it, I so desperately wanted to love it and buy multiple copies for decoration and make it my entire personality for the rest of my life, but now I can\'t because I cannot just pretend I love it for the sake of it! Like let me be upset in peace!?!?I\'ve had a couple of days to sit on it and let my thoughts marinate even more, but like I said, I don\'t think my expectations were too high? Like I\'ve read the Caraval books, OUABH and TBONA, I know what to expect from a Stephanie Garber book, hence why I love Stephanie Garber books. The only thing I was ""expecting"" were things she mentioned that seemed important (and some were very important) but were either ignored or rushed.The thought that prompted me to make an update was the ✨️love confession✨️. My favourite thing about Evangeline was that she was just like me and she so desperately just wanted to be loved and wanted to be chosen. As per my favourite quote;""This was why parts of Jacks’s story had twisted so painfully inside her. It wasn’t because she wanted Jacks. She didn’t want Jacks. She just wanted someone to want her the way Jacks had wanted this girl. And she didn’t want it to be because of a spell or a curse. Evangeline wanted a real love powerful enough to break a spell, which was exactly what Jacks wanted, too.""Girl just wanted someone to go above and beyond for her like Jacks wanted to do for Donatella and I don\'t think she got that. Sure, Jacks went back in time to save Evangeline’s life, but then he wanted to be as far from her as possible. He didn’t fight for her. He didn\'t try again with Honora to break his curse (because if it\'s a curse that little old Aurora put, how is it that her mother can\'t break it?) He didn\'t try to find a back door for his own curse, or through the debt she still owed. NOTHING. He chose to leave to protect her and Evangeline practically begged him to please just TRY for her😭 Even then, HE STILL DIDN\'T TRY AND PUSHED HER AWAY!So when the love confession scene comes and Evangeline is pouring her heart out and Jacks just says ""I love you""??????? The debate around this is that, well it would be out of character for Jacks to give a big grand love confession and I disagree! Of course, if he gave the typical Apollo lovesick cursed confession then yeah that\'s odd, but NO ONE WAS EXPECTING THAT. I thought that his POVs revealed his true feelings and if those were put into dialogue with an ""I love you"" at the end, THAT\'S LITERALLY THE MOST PERFECT LOVE CONFESSION! My issue is that we as the audience know how he feels, but Evangeline doesn\'t since she wasn\'t in his head with us!!So yeah, Jacks didn\'t fight for Evangeline, she fought for him. He only fought for her AFTER she was already safe and when there was no longer a threat🤠 ""HE WAS TRAUMATISED! SHE DIED IN HIS ARMS!"" BOOOHOOO!!!!!!😒 You are a villain, ACT LIKE IT!!!Anyway I will probably reread ACFTL sometime soon and maybe my opinions will change!'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '3.5⭐️'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'i am unwell. how am i supposed to move on fromthem?~•~•~depending on how this book goes, this could be my villain origin story.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '↠ 4 stars ✩spoilers are marked *ੈ‧₊˚💌 “once upon a time, a girl who believed in fairytales stole the heart of a prince who had sworn to never love.”evajacks are the definition ofheartbreak.from the start of once upon a broken heart, i\'ve read about their tension and longing, the push and pull between them, and been completely mesmerized about how they\'ve always cared for one another. this world has taken me on such a journey, from the magical descriptions about the feeling of love to overanalyzing literally every single sentence from the ballad of never after to see if i could get any clues for the next book! i\'ve always adored tropes and plots that have a sense of poetry to them, so ""a fairytale-loving girl + a prince who had sworn to never love?"" perfection <3୨୧ a little spoiler section, skip to the end of the paragraph ୨୧this book smashed my heart into a million pieces, i could go on for hours about how much this series in general means to me, but i\'ll start with theflaws.i\'m confused about a couple things, what happened to marisol? i thought we\'d at least see where she ended up, and what about aurora? she was the antagonist here, and i was almost completely sure we\'d get some closure about her. to be quite honest, even though aurora was the villain in afctl, her asking eva why jacks couldn\'t love her, i cried a little bita lot.wheneversomeone doesn\'t love you backis incorporated into a storyline, it\'s almost guaranteed to make me sob into my pillow. i don\'t really think this rating expresses my true feelings about the book, i have so many more little irks but just the characters, their happy ever after, i had to give this 4 stars!fantasy writing is my favorite, the whimsical descriptions, and the world building is mesmerizing. so you can imagine how much i love stephanie\'s style! her way of phrasing sentences, instead of saying that a moment was delicately balanced, she writes:instead of being carved in stone, this moment felt like a fragile sort of tapestry that could unravel with one tug on a thread—or one pull of a leaf.i\'m in love ♡“the greatest love story ever told: the true and unabridged history of evangeline fox and the prince of hearts.”⤿ evangeline.our heroine. i get emotional just thinking about her story, i\'m so proud of how far she\'s come.her recognizing jacks and loving him even when she had forgot makes me so happy.her and lala are such a fun and chaotic duo, their conversations nearly always made me laugh, they are so protective of one another.

But I think it's a reason to fight for those things.”I have so many thoughts yet feel like I’m at a loss for words in describing what I felt which was so many different emotions. I can’t deny I was conflicted with my rating but more so for the plot lacking certain elements than the characters because Iadoredthem wholeheartedly and in my eyes they wereperfecteven if this wasn’t.4 stars ✨even though in my heart theydeserve♾️ stars*no spoilers but maybe don’t continue reading if you don’t know who evangeline & jacks are*evangelineI was so much more in awe of her here. THE GROWTH. Idc what anyone says, I thought her character development here was actively felt. she had a better sense of awareness (compared to ouabh) and all while she remained herself with the belief she has in everything working out and that hopeful loving heart of hers. A heart I’m so glad she has because without it— I’m not sure she would’ve been able to endure all of the challenging obstacles. Our little fox stood up for herself and how she felt and didn’t back down and I was so proud and admired her strength in doing so.jacksfinally we got his pov and it was everything to see how he felt while it lasted. there’s much to say about him despite him having all of 5 chapters and i refuse to believe that’s it?! i truly treasured what we did get of him and was the happiest when we got his first pov. He definitely had most of our hearts here. Anyways, getting to know how he felt was much needed even if it was the fear and anguish he felt in putting Eva in danger. it was clearly easier for him to deny himself and deliberately destroy any chance to be happy as he felt he wasn’t deserving of it. I know how tormented and haunted he felt and it crushed me as we all know he enjoyed inflicting pain but not receiving it himself. I’m really gonna miss his ravishing and animatedapple eating scoundrelself“It’s you. It will always be you, until the end of time. And I’ll fight fate or anyone else who tries to tear us apart—including you.”evajacksthey are the epitome of enchantment and curious wonder. I don’t remember any of the ones most of us grew up with that shared the exact qualities these two had—especially their banter. What did it for me was: the tangible yet intangible little touches between them, the subtle hints of romance in each and every word that they said and didn’t say with their hearts, jacks best day, the note, the little banter and angst between them, chapter 41 (forever ingrained in my heart and mind), eva & jacks protectiveness and unrelenting determination in not giving up on each other—all of that is what I loved from this. I’m gonna miss these two precious characters so much as I’ve truly enjoyed their journey in all that they weren’t to what they became and it’s been utterly bittersweetMy issues with this:Starting with Apollo and all I’ll say is that I’m glad he got the ending he deserved—it was very fitting to the joke that he was lol. While I was annoyed with how many POVs we got from him, (as I feel like it overshadowed in some way Eva and jacks POVs) I do see how it worked for the story and for the dramatic effect of this. However, I wish Stephanie compensated in giving us more of jacks POVs as well as it made the most sense to given this is the conclusion to their story and from all the build up in the previous books since it felt in someway disappointing. Aside from giving us the jacks we got in tbona as he was missed here. Definitely validate each rating given to this because of the loving yet conflicting things felt about it.I’m greedy and wanted more of them as it didn’t feel enough once things finally happened 🥲 I’m sad their story is over as they’re now permanently etched into my brain and I’d love more of jacks and Eva with more domestic scenes in a novella. I wouldn’t be opposed to any fanfics honestly lol as these books brought back the spellbinding fairytale feels we all enjoy. I’m hoping this universe continues with lalas and chaos’ story as I saw the potentialThe bonus epilogues of alternate endings were so endearing and gave me what I felt the ending to this lacked as it felt rushed. this book in general felt like it was missing so much. But as Evangeline says”every story has the possibility for infinite endings”to which held true here.OUABHTBONAI highlighted practically every encounter and word spoken between them so here’s 4 quotes:“I’m your monster, Evangeline.”“I’d rather go up in flames with him than watch while he burns.”“love was more than a feeling. And it didn’t have to be the safe choice, because love was also more powerful than fear. It was the ultimate form of hope. It was stronger than curses.”“Evangeline knew he would carry her through more than just freezing waters. He would pull her through fire if he had to, haul her from the clutches of war, from falling cities and breaking worlds.——Thenerves and excitementI feel rn is so real 🥹 bingeing this all I can tonight but I’m already seeing how difficult it’s gonna be not being able to speak about it for now. Anyways, happy reading to everyone reading it now and tomorrow!! 🫶🏼""}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""i'm certainly not the target audience for this but i bet this will be disappointing for fans of the series.the romantic tension is lacking, the villain is one dimensional... and i stg there are characters who just ceased to matter? where the step sister bitch go? whole series is a bit of a mess tbh.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'ONCE UPON A DELULU GIRLthought this was gonna be A BALLAD OF CUTE ROMANCEbut it ended up being A CURSE FOR ALL THE HEART ATTACKSThis was a perfect ending to a wonderful series. And I must admit, this book was magnificent on its own. It made me fall in love with fantasy and romance and fairytales all over again (like I spent a day in my life not loving those three but let\'s not get into details). This is my favorite installment in this series and I\'ll list a few non-spoilery reasons why I loved it so much:1) IT WAS FAST-PACED As we all know by now (I sound like a broken record), my reading hasn\'t been great lately and I struggle finishing ANYTHING! This book, I flew through it! From the very first to the very last page, it kept my attention, it was atmospheric, action-packed. I must admit, not as many twists as in the previous books but those are not neccessary for a book to be good or enjoyable. Miss Garber is a fantastic storyteller and even though her characters and stories aren\'t my ""Roman Empire"" (I tend to think more about darker and sadder stories, yes I\'m crazy and those stick with me), but in the moment, when I\'m reading them, I feel like I\'m in a Disney movie. The atmosphere is something this author is very good at creating and the feeling of escaping reality is something most of our readers look for. What we need, she delivers!2) A PERFECT ENDING As we all know, once again, book 2 ended on a terrible cliffhanger and I was very curious on how would this end, especially since the book is not that long and there was MUCH to unfold. I didn\'t predict the exact ending we got but I\'m satisfied with it, it was along the line of what I thought it would be like... It wrapped up the story beautifully, all the characters stayed true to their nature, and THE VIBES WERE VIBING.3) THE WRITING WAS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL I\'m a huge fan of this author\'s writing, it\'s perfect for fantasy, especially romantasy. I thought I forgot details about the plot and I would need a good reread, but that turned out to not be the case. Garber eased us back into the story as an expert she is, reminded me of the little things I forgot about without any big info dumps or any dragging in the terms of plot. There were so many sappy moments and that one quote about having two hearts, one that breaks and the other one that beats and keeps you alive, MY BRAIN WILL COME BACK TO THAT ONE SOMETIME AROUND MINDNIGHT TONIGHT I JUST KNOW IT4) EVAJACKS DELIVERED This is but it doesn\'t need to be a point. I expected them to be perfect and they were indeed perfect. I loved their story in previous two books, but the tension, the yearning, their love really got to shine in this book.I don\'t want to make this review any longer. I\'m pretty afraid I\'ll repeat myself or spoil anything. I was incredibly scared going into this but it turned out to be a wonderful reading experience. STEPHANIE GARBER WE NEED MORE BOOKS IN THIS UNIVERSE, THANK YOU (something about Chaos perhaps???)��💓💕💓'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3 starsAfter reading this last book, I seriously think it\'s overrated. The book lacked a lot of things, and I thought the last book would make up for not giving us cute scenes of EvaJacks in previous books, but there was nothing. NOTHING.❝I am a monster, but whether you remember it or not, I’m your monster, Evangeline.❞I really tried to love it, I do like some of its scenes, but this one didn\'t live up to its hype. TBONA had some cute scenes of EvaJacks, but mostly it was Jacks saving Eva\'s life again and again, and her realizing her love for him. In this book,Jacks however, felt like a side character.In fictional books, even if the main hero is not on the pages, he still has enough importance or, I don\'t know, JUST SOMETHING that you still remember him. But here I was constantly waiting for Jacks\' POV to come, otherwise, there was no scene of Jacks in the first 60 pages. Apollo was there, and his POVs are the most useless things ever.This book just dragged and dragged, and the slow-burn was nearly nonexistent when there were barely interactions between Eva & Jacks in this book.Instead of giving them a proper ending and some domestic scenes and filling the blanks of the last two books and revelation of some minor cute details we missed, WE GOT APOLLO\'S POV???🤡 EvaJacks literally have one kiss throughout this whole trilogy, and literally zero confession scenes? That ""I love you"" moment made me feel nothing. I was numb by the point I reached there.• Basically, Eva lost her memory in this book, and Apollo made Jacks seem like the villain after he was the one who wiped her memories. Apollo tried to rewrite the history, but Eva was still determined to get her memories back, and she felt that something was WRONG. It\'s not what she wanted. Jacks came into her life again but this time as Archer, and she was immediately drawn to himagain.Now the whole Archer thing didn\'t last much, I expected self-defense lesson scenes, but Jacks disappeared after that. He came back just to save her and went again.Apollo and Eva kissed more than Evajacks did, and Apollo is such a bitch? I WILL NOT FORGET THAT MF LOSER PATHETIC PERSON. He legit killed a 14-year-old boy like whyyyyyyyy????? That boy was traumatized and survived, and he was like \'he\'s too trusting, I did him a favor\' 🖕🏻I thought Apollo was more like a Tamlin-Adam Kent type of character, but he\'s literally the worst. THEY were at least better and weren\'t entirely selfish, they wanted the girl, that\'s why they did questionable things, but Apollo was just a stuck-up narcissist who was delusional as fuck and believed that he would get Evangeline because he\'s better thanJACKS.Well, fuck you, got to be kidding me 😒 and even though I might have thought that he would become better and I might not hate him, his character was getting worse, and he died such a horrifying death that I\'m actually glad for it. I suspected that he would be the one who\'ll die because if he had truly loved Eva, he wouldn\'t have tried to sacrificed her to become an immortal.The Valors suck! They were useless, petty, whiny, pathetic creatures exceptCastor😌, but yeah, I hated them.They were here for page fillers, and their entire existence was as useless as Apollo\'s POV. Aurora was the actual VILLAIN – a shitty one at that – and she was the one who put the fatal kiss and the archer\'s kiss curse on Jacks like WHAAAATTT- I thought she was one of the good guys. Everyone sucks, and I hate them sfm!❝Jacks had so badly wanted to tell her that he couldn’t even remember what Donatella looked like, that Evangeline’s face was the only one he saw whenever he closed his eyes, that he would go with her anywhere . . . if he could.❞Jacks\' past was truly sad, even tho he did do questionable things, we literally GOT 0 CONFESSION (as in I DID THAT BECAUSE BLAH BLAH AND I DIDN\'T MEAN THAT BLAH BLAH), but he stayed true to his character.The vulnerability throughout this book was the main thing why I still liked it. Evangeline\'s love and her hope that it would be enough to break the curse and Jacks sacrificing his beating heart just to get the cuff that\'ll protect Evangeline forever, and she won\'t get hurt were literally the best parts.I love Jacks so much, and Eva had good character development. It\'s just her BLUSHING at everything was unnecessary just like Apollo\'s POV. Nvm this book didn\'t give us any cute scenes!Marisol\'s ending was left out, and I doubt she\'d get her own book. Luc didn\'t make any appearance, and he should have apologized.Evangeline is human, and Jacks is not quite immortal, he\'s ageless, so obviously, Eva will become older.There should be a scene where Jacks gifts her a YOUTH STONE NECKLACE so that she stays young with him forever, but obv we got NOTHING. I\'m just happy it\'s a HEA.FFS NO APPLE CONFESSION? I figured it was just so he could stop himself from hurting anyone and not kissing anyone.He needed so many apples with Eva because if he didn\'t have them, he might kiss her and all. The colors were just a unique touch. Now I do hope the author gives us Lala/Chaos, and she leaves Dane for good and realizes that she was wrong to hold on to her love for him him forever.•Once Upon A Broken Heart– 4 stars•The Ballad Of Never After– 3.75 stars'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4,5 ★“𝙄 𝙖𝙢 𝙖 𝙢𝙪𝙧𝙙𝙚𝙧𝙚𝙧.

",Emily Henry,4.24,735386,1286,"Romance, Fiction, Audiobook, Contemporary, Contemporary Romance, Adult, Chick Lit",400,23-04-2024,"A shimmering, joyful new novel about a pair of opposites with the wrong thing in common, from #1New York Timesbestselling author Emily Henry.Daphne always loved the way her fiancé, Peter, told their story. How they met (on a blustery day), fell in love (over an errant hat), and moved back to his lakeside hometown to begin their life together. He really was good at telling it... right up until the moment he realized he was actually in love with his childhood best friend Petra.Which is how Daphne begins her new story: stranded in beautiful Waning Bay, Michigan, without friends or family but with a dream job as a children’s librarian (that barely pays the bills), and proposing to be roommates with the only person who could possibly understand her predicament: Petra’s ex, Miles Nowak.Scruffy and chaotic—with a penchant for taking solace in the sounds of heart break love ballads—Miles is exactly the opposite of practical, buttoned-up Daphne, whose coworkers know so little about her they have a running bet that she’s either FBI or in witness protection. The roommates mainly avoid one another, until one day, while drowning their sorrows, they form a tenuous friendship and a plan. If said plan also involves posting deliberately misleading photos of their summer adventures together, well, who could blame them?But it’s all just for show, of course, because there’s no way Daphne would actually start her new chapter by falling in love with her ex-fiancé’s new fiancée’s ex... right?","[{'rating': 5, 'content': '4.75!“All those moments throughout the days, weeks, months that don\'t get marked on calendars with hand-drawn stars or little stickers.Those are the moments that make a life.Not grand gestures, but mundane details that, over time, accumulate until you have a home, instead of a house.The things that matter.The things I can\'t stop longing for.”Now I am not gonna lie but this was not Emily\'s best work and after a rant withRoxyI understand that there can be some things that could have been done to make the story better but that does not change the fact that I loved reading this book and did not want it to end because you just have to read Emily Henry\'s works to understand that! Good writing is such a plus for me because if the writing isengaging and has you fully immersedin the book you probably won\'t see the problems that it has, unless its pin pointed out and this was the case with this book because I was so in love with the writing and the characters and with everything that she set up that I did not even find anything bothering me. She writes such intricate characters who you can relate with so much and you actually do feel for them, overlapped with such realistic qualities and problems that makes you relate to them and that doesn\'t make you feel alone because you see how another character faces the same problems, deals with it the same way you do and there\' just something so beautiful about it.Okay so it\'s basically about two two people Daphna and Miles both their Fiancées cheat on them which leads to Daphne getting kicked out of Peters house and has to stay with Miles and while they both are there, the get a wedding invitation from their exes which leads to Miles and Daphne falling into a fake relationship to make them jealous and honestly them being roommates as well was so hot. It was different from other fake dating tropes because of the way it was set but the way it unraveled could have been something more. There\'s this quote during this scene where Daphne tells Miles of what she did that I laughed at and smiled stupidly at:""Wait!\' He braces his hands against the counter, face brightening. ""So he called to try to make you feel so pathetic you wouldn\'t come ruin his special day and you told him we were dating?\'\'Im sorry,\' I say again.\'That fucking rules,\' He says. \'How\'d he take it?""Daphne and Miles were such good characters and I kind of think that there could have been more depth to them but I still enjoyed the way that they were written in like Daphne self doubting herself because of her father always left her after promising that he was there to stay and I loved how she got over it and finally confessed her feeling by giving an angry rant on his phone because he needed that and I also appreciated the bond that she had with her mother although I do think that we could have gotten more one on one scenes for them and as for Miles, I loved him so much and its with all Emily Henry\'s men, I see myself in them.. be it Gus, Wyn, Charlie, Alex or Miles theres always something within them that I find I can relate too and for here with Miles was how he texts, the way he overuses the word nice which bugRoxyoff so much but for me the thing that I related to him the most was whereHe panicked and reacted anxiously and then realized what he had done a little too lateI won\'t elaborate on that because that would be a spoiler but I did get him during that scene but besides that scene, Miles was such a cute and hot too?? loved him. There was one thing that I appreciated as well but thought more could have been done was Miles past with her mother and how it turned him into who he was, always overlooking peoples negative side, never lashing out and always being nice(?)Their banter that I loved:""True,\' he says \'but I haven\'t had any luck yet tracking down the stretch of beach where thirtysomethings go to smoke weed\'\'Oh, they\'re all just vaping from their beds while watching HGTV\'\'Not us,\' he says\'No, we\'re adventurous\' I say""_""I turn to look at him. \'Even when you try to be mean, you\'re nice,\'His eyes seem to spark when he smiles. \'I\'ll try harder.""_""Do me a favor,\' he says lightly, \'Unlock your door.\'\'Why?\'\'So I can push you out as I peel out of the parking lot,\' he says,\'You would never,\' I say\'I would never\' he admits.""_“Drink. Dance. Have fun.”“In a room with our exes,” I point out. “Who think we’re dating.”Miles’s smile hitches up. “See?” he says. “Doesn’t that sound fun?”I absolutely loved the friendship that Ashleigh and Daphne had because it was so down to earth and real and raw that I just fell in love with it and I think it was because Emily focused on Ashleighs character as well and gave her a story which made us understand where she was coming from and what was happening and how that eventually led them to be friends and I also loved how she supported Daphne\'s decisions but wont lie to her as well and would subtly try to make her understand things, she was certainly better than whatever the fuck Sadie was. Another bond that I liked but thought some scenes could have been explored more was of Miles and his sister JUlie they were just so wholesome and cute and deserve the whole world.""You\'re worth it, Daphne,"" he says, hand soft on my jaw and eyes closed.\'Miles?\' I whisper. \'I do, I do what all those parts of you\'His eyes open, molten, warm, \'Good,\' He says. \'They want you too.\'Then he kisses me.""The romance was honestly the horniest Emily has ever been it was not I would say insta-lust because there was development and it wasn\'t like \' oh one look and im hard\' but it was that instead of the intense pining, proximity and slow burn, they just acted on what they felt. I am a sucker for slow burn and wanted more but I cant deny how much I enjoyed reading the scenes. Also, the way emily henry also writes poetic smut?? Like??? How can you do that woman. Despite it being her horniest, it was very well balanced.Now,The things that could have been better;(spoilers)(credits;roxy)1, More drama as we were promised a wedding which could have increased the sexual tension, the fake dating part and the drama a lot.2, Daphne going to her mom to rant like we saw Rory do with Lorelai in Gilmore Girls.3, Male povs because having Miles\'s POV would have been so interesting since would\'ve gotten his emotional scene with Julie and it wouldve been more showing and less telling.4, More drama by Miles\'s mother meeting them and this book being at least 200 pages moreNowthe scenes that I loved1, When Daphne gets dumped and throws almonds at Petra and Peter2, Miles and Daphne hanging out across the town3, The cherry hill scene with Ashleigh, Miles and Daphne4, Daphne making it up to Ashleigh5, Miles going to confront Daphne\'s dad6, The cute tender moments between Miles and Daphne that will make you feel single.7, the milkshake, fries and beach scene.Overall, a fantastic read that I will definitely read again and again despite some things that could have been added.Ratings for her other books:1, Beach read: 52, Happy place: 53, Funny story: 4.754, People we meet on vacation: 4.55, Book lovers: 4.02Special shoutout toRoxyfor getting me to read all of Emily\'s books last year and hearing my rants about it.

This is my first Emily Henry book that turned out being such a letdown for me, as I was a big fan of the rest of her stories, or at least most of them. I\'m still not entirely sure if the title was meant to refer to the way our two main characters, Miles and Daphne, began their relationship — ""You know, Funny Story.. my fiancé dumped me for his childhood best friend, who happened to be Miles’s girlfriend, and that’s how we ended up living together, and then I accidentally told my ex-fiancé that Miles and I are dating, so now we are fake dating."", or if it was just meant to suggest that this would be a fun story to read. Maybe it even refers to both of these options at the same time — which is most likely, but unfortunately, as I already said, it didn\'t end up to be a fun read for me.As usual, as in every Emily Henry book, we have a book-loving character, this time a librarian — Daphne, who turned out to be quite an okay heroine for me. I could relate to her in a few ways and if I had to choose which main character I liked more, I would point at her, but at the same time, she wasn\'t even close to the bond I had with January, who I\'m starting to think will always be my favorite heroine of this author. I probably would have felt more than just ""quite okay"" about her if she hadn\'t moaned every time she ate something, but like I said, she wasn\'t that bad. I actually loved that she stood her ground and never considered going back to her cheating ex-fiancé, unlike our hero who wasn\'t so sure about it and who, speaking of which — let\'s get to him now.Miles Nowak, our Bridget Jones\'s Diary-watching, spicy-woodsy-smelling (like every other romance book hero), Crocs-loving hero who as for now is my least favorite Emily Henry male character. Yes, he had some good moments, but instead of screaming, blushing, and kicking my feet for how wonderful he was with Daphne, I kept thinking about these facts about him""Miles looks up at me.“They,” I say, “suck.”“She’s the love of my life,” he says.“The love of your life sucks,” I tell him.""The love of your life? Hell no. I didn\'t like that he said that about his cheating ex-girlfriend, so I expected him to say the same thing about the heroine later in the book, but that didn\'t happen. I know he loved Daphne and chose her, but this quote left a bitter taste in my mouth.Or when the question was asked ""if they would get back together with their exes"" and Daphne\'s answer was this""Would he take her back? I find myself wondering, before seamlessly transitioning into Would I take Peter back?“Definitely not,”I say aloud.""and Miles’s that""Petra was the exception, not the rule, for me. So if she wanted to get back together?I don’t know.But it’s not worth thinking about, since she’s engaged to your ex-boyfriend.”She cheated on you with her best friend?!? What do you mean ""I don’t know.""?? It should have been ""No."" from the very beginning when you found out about it.The worst moment in the book that confirmed me why he is my least favorite Emily Henry hero was when he went to see his ex when she called him crying and because of that he left Daphne waiting for him.""And then Petra called, and she was sobbing. So hard I couldn’t understand her. I’d never seen her cry before. I honestly thought someone had died. She asked if I could come see her, and I said yes. Because I was worried.I still care about her.”Shecheated on youand then a month later was engaged to her best friend!?! What do mean you still care about her??""I didn’t mean to tell her first.” The tops of his cheeks redden. “That I’m in love with you.""And then the first person to know he loved Daphne was also his ex. You know that feeling when you read a romance novel and you just feel that the hero loves the heroine? In Miles\' case it was the opposite. Throughout the book, I had the impression that if his ex-girlfriend wanted to come back to him, he would welcome her with open arms. Only at the end of the book, when he did one thing, I was like ""Hmm, okay, maybe he loves Daphne then."". But as I just said, I only started feeling it at the end of the book. All the things I mentioned, plus the fact that a month after the breakup he still kept pictures of her in his room instead of burning them, are why he will probably always be my least favorite Emily character.I don\'t even know what to say about the romance part of the book because it was boring as the chemistry between Daphne and Miles seemed non-existent to me. They finally confessed their love to each other, and the only thing I felt was happiness, because I knew that this book would end soon. I guess that alone says enough how much I enjoyed their love story.I never expected that reading Emily Henry\'s book would evoke so many unpleasant emotions in me, and yet, as you can see, it unfortunately happened. I hope I\'m in the minority of people who feel this way, because Emily\'s book being one of the biggest disappointments of the year wasn’t on my bingo card.────────Me at my graduation: 😐Me at my wedding: 😐Me when Emily Henry announces a new book: 😍😍😩😩😻😻😻😍🥰🥰😍🥰'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I give this book 4.5 stars, rounded up to steamy forced proximity, friends to lovers, opposites attraction. In no way can I give any Emily Henry book less than five stars.This book isn\'t my favorite among Emily Henry\'s works. ""Happy Place"" holds that position, while ""People We Meet on Vacation"" is my least favorite of hers. (By the way, both earned five stars from me, so I have to work on a different grading system for Henry’s books like triple five stars, minus five stars, etc. But I\'m sure each of her books will become my favorite romance readings of the year, even though Colleen Hoover releases a book at the same time. Yep, ColHo fans, I’m one of yours, but fair is fair! Emily Henry is a true musician and poet playing the strings of my heart.)But let\'s be honest: Miles Nowak is the BEST BOYFRIEND Emily Henry has created! He’s caring, a charm magnet, selfless, easy-going, adventurous – not only the best boyfriend but also the best male friend any woman seeks. His irresistible hotness is the cherry on top. I\'m usually irritated by the heroes Emily Henry creates, but so far, Miles has exceeded them with his good heart, sense of humor, naturalness, without having a selfish bone in his body!I have to admit I had doubts when I first decided to read this book because I\'ve never been a fan of love triangles or ex-lover situations. When they are involved, things get messier, and emotions get blurrier. Most characters do something irritating, missing the ex or trying to rekindle, which pisses me off.I won\'t give spoilers, but I can say this: the situation of becoming roommates with your ex-fiancée’s new fiancée’s ex-boyfriend couldn’t be handled very gently and fairly. Both Daphne and Miles are wise, analyzing their situations very reasonably. When they accidentally find themselves in a fake dating situation, they even share their thoughts honestly. That’s why I loved both of the characters. They know their own flaws, weaknesses, and they don’t whine or obsess over their exes. They hold each other to get through the trauma, and from their mutual tragic incident, a beautiful, unique friendship is born. I loved how they slowly lowered down their barriers, learning to explore themselves and the huge life awaiting them. They acted so mature and were so careful not to be each other’s rebound, even though the sparks fly and burn the apartment they share to the ground.The plot revolves around Daphne, who loves the story of how she met her fiancée Peter until he dumps her after the bachelor party to choose his childhood friend Petra over her, giving her one week to move from their shared house, heading to the Amalfi Coast with his new girlfriend! Yes, what a jerk! Homeless and hopeless, Daphne, who recently left her old life behind to start a new life with Peter, finds Miles: Petra’s dumped a few minutes ago boyfriend at Peter’s door, and she pops up the question: is there any vacant room at your apartment?Yes, the equation might be too complicated. Daphne: reserved, tight-lipped, buttoned-up children’s librarian living with a carefree, adventurous, pothead guy who is working odd jobs, as her ex-fiancée defined. But when they get an invitation to Petra & Peter’s wedding, their very reserved roommate relationship changes after a night ends at the bar, and both of them decide to RSVP to the wedding. And guess what? The same day Peter makes a pity call that leads Daphne to lie about her relationship situation with Miles. She says they are dating, and thankfully Miles plays along with her game.But what if she misjudged Miles from the beginning? This self-deprecating, friendly guy who always puts others before him, comes to the library to cheer him up when she reads books to the kids, takes him places in town she has never seen, helps her open her mind and heart, rediscovering herself. Is he the guy her heart wants?Well, I loved Miles, I loved Daphne & Miles\' love story, and the beautiful epilogue in the end! No more words! Emily Henry never disappoints me! She meticulously solved this challenging relationship equation with the best possible outcome! Go on! Read, reread, and reread this lovely book!Many thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing this amazing book’s digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest thoughts.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology:medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'my heart is broken. i feel like i\'m dying. the world holds nothing for me anymore.i\'m three starring this book.i adore emily henry, and i have since her magical realism days. i\'d happily read her to-do lists if she released them once a year, and i\'m sure even those would have more banter and loveliness and whimsy than your average full-length release just by virtue of being written by her. i\'d say the same about her grocery lists, but i already do read those. (the woman writes a mean substack.)there were a few things i didn\'t love about this book. it tries to fitso muchinto a few hundred pages: our protagonist, daphne, is left by her fiance weeks before her wedding, causing her to: move in with miles, her fiance\'s new girlfriend\'s ex-boyfriend; realize she has no friends; begin a quest to find herself; get over the fiancé and fall in love with miles; join a variety of community groups and neighborhood activities; make her current job her dream job; repress some CLEAR mommy issues i thought we were going to address, and fully get over her daddy issues.all of this is happening so much.it comes at a cost, which is that typical emily henry magic (and i don\'t just mean the bygone magical realism i mourn every day and never shut up about).this book is not quite as funny — jokes feel forced, sometimes to the point that you can only identify something as reaching for funny because the character ""joked"" or ""played along"" instead of ""said.""it is not quite as polished, with writing feeling a bit unconfident, full of words italicized for emphasis and, you know, the whole verbs that aren\'t said thing. (there are a LOT of dialogue attribution words that aren\'t ""said."")and the characters have none of their usual better-version-of-reality charm. miles\' nick miller archetype would never work for me personally, but my real issue with him is that his character traits fade once we\'re supposed to see him as a romantic prospect. our side characters, ashleigh and julia, feel like interchangeable joke-bots to the point of being vaguely threatening. (when they pop up on page in tandem i feel a sense of unease.)and to be honest, daphne has no self awareness. because there\'s so much happening in this book, everything has to be incredibly simple: daphne\'s issue with her dad, AND daphne\'s issue with miles, AND daphne\'s friends\' issue with daphne all has to be the same. it makes for some moments of ridiculousness — like how can daphne be melting down about being wronged on the same city block where she realized several hours earlier she had wronged someone in that exact same way? how could she be so unwilling to give the grace she expects for herself? and how could emily henry set scenes of this book on a cherry farm in michigan when she knew what it would do to me, specifically?!sorry. that\'s the last time i\'ll bring up magical realism. i think.ol\' daph just has too much to figure out about herself. i think this abandonment would be so completely traumatic even if she HADN\'T built her entire life around her fiancé only to be left entirely alone, and even if it WASN\'T eerily similar to her daddy issues, and even if she DIDN\'T have a bunch of unresolved things going on up in ye olde memory palace, that the last thing she\'d be doing is sticking around someone else\'s hometown flirting with her new roomie.especially since what she ends up doing is repeating the exact same cycle with no awareness at all.and in the worst offense, miles\' illiterate texting style reminded me of the himbos i used to date (date doing a lot of heavy lifting here) in my wayward youth. which should be a jailable offense in and of itself.bottom line: like anything emily henry has ever written, this is better than a lot of books. it just isn\'t better than most emily henry ones.----------------------currently-reading updateme

would like to request that no one talk to me about anything that isn\'t this for the next 3 to 5 business years.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'to preface this review, i love and adore emily henry\'s books. book lovers is in my top 5 books of all time (and i am not a romance reader), and happy place is the only book that made me cry last year. time is truly measured in emily henry releases for me.my current emily henry rom com ranking is: book lovers (5 stars), happy place (5 stars), beach read (4.5 stars), funny story (3 stars), and people we meet on vacation (2.5 stars). if we have completely different rankings, you\'ll probably feel differently about this book!if you are a big romance reader (reading booksforthe romance), you will most likely enjoy this a lot. but if you are a lit fic reader who loves emily henry books for the protagonists and their introspection and the fact that her romance feels grounded and realistic (me), this might be a slight miss. it\'s been a while since i\'ve described an emily henry book as just ""good"", but this one feels like that for me.funny story still has emily henry\'s signature witty dialogue and chemistry between miles and daphne. it is arguably her most commercial romance to date, filled with more romantic scenes between the two characters. daphne, after being dumped by her fiancé for his best friend, decides to room with miles, who was dumped by said best friend. in classic emily henry rom com style, funny story is set in a beautiful town in the midwest (michigan), charged with quick banter and heart to hearts between the characters. in this vein, the book felt like a mix of beach read and book lovers, in a sense.but not really. while it\'s impossible for me to dislike a emily henry book because of her writing, much of my enjoyment as a reader comes from being able to see myself and parts of my personality reflected through either protagonist. for book lovers, it was overwhelmingly nora, for happy place, it was harriet, for beach read, it was gus, and for people we meet on vacation, it was alex. and so on.the main qualm i had with funny story is that neither miles nor daphne felt relatable to me, which made it a less enjoyable read than her other books. this is why i say that my neutral stance on this book is most likely a personal one. daphne and miles both felt very confusing to me as characters, almost as if they were hybrids of emily henry\'s previous characters. i couldn\'t quite get either of their characterizations or defining traits. there is not a single emily henry book i didn\'t read in one sitting...until this one.like i mentioned above, a big reason for my love for emily henry books is her protagonists and how their introspection does not read like other commercial romance books, but more like literary fiction. her characters are well thought through, reflective, and very three dimensional. nora was literally just me from start to finish (so i don\'t have to really put forth a defense about three dimensionality). harriet\'s introspection on loneliness and living for other people genuinely changed my life. but daphne didn\'t really have any.the chemistry and get-together also felt a bit rushed and forced at times, and the dialogue and heart to hearts felt less genuine and blander than her other books. for a book called funny story, it was...not. i think my big issue was just with miles as well. he just didn\'t enough charisma and charm for this book to be memorable for me. wyn and alex didn\'t really either, but i related a lot to alex and wyn was redeemed through harriet.funny story is a great read and definitely still a cut above other romance books. but this one just didn\'t do it for me. i really hope her next release works for me!thank you berkley for the arc!⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻i didn\'t love this i\'m sorry guysreview to come⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻I GOT THE ARC WHOOOOOOO⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻emily henry ! do you want my firstborn? my college diploma? my kidney? you name it, it’s yours !!!'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4 stars!i have now read three emily henry books, and while she is undoubtedly a talented writer, what i find most fascinating is the loyalty of her readers; going to your nearest bookstore on release day for a book that is probably no less than $30 — that’s dedication. and you know what, i think i finally get it.i didn’t have particularly high expectations for funny story, but in all transparency, this just might be my favorite book of hers, hovering right above beach read (which i thoroughly enjoyed) and book lovers (of which i have no recollection but still think highly). it’s far from perfect, but it does a lot of things well, and that’s quite a feat considering it’s less than 400 pages (proof that less is more!) and, according to the reviews i’ve seen, her most “romantic” romance novel yet.still — i think funny story, like her other books, straddles the line between lighthearted romcom and introspective women’s fiction. the banter in this one is some of the best she’s written — it’s reread worthy, the kind that makes you laugh out loud. the characters themselves are wonderfully written; it’s obvious that emily henry adores them. she crafted miles and daphne with so much care and thought, adding dimension to the characters through their experiences and focusing on how said experiences changed and ultimately shaped them into the miles and daphne we read about in this book. it’s rare for me to like one mc in a romance book, let alone both, but daphne felt so relatable — her thoughts mirrored my very own at times. and miles i had a soft spot for because how could you not? he’sthis is me tryingpersonified. and the romance? god, the romance. i’m a harsh rater, even more so when it comes to contemporary romance. but in every! one! of! her! books! emily henry prioritizes the emotional connection between the two main characters. and the way she develops their relationship and has them slowly open up to each other? it gets me. every. time. i live for their vulnerable moments, for their conversations about their pasts, about what haunts them, as much as i live for their banter.despite this being first and foremost a romance, it is also a story about rediscovering yourself, relearning who you are and what you like and what you want out of life. it’s a reminder to live for yourself, to spend your days with the people you love, to love them without restraint or inhibition. the ending is beautifully uplifting, the last sentence tying back to the very first, the tone hopeful and reassuring. it’s what i think i needed right now as someone who’s entering her twenties and is so intimidated by the unknown, who’s tempted to run away from the unpredictability of it all. and i’m sure it’s a book i’ll come back to when, in five years, my life will probably make even less sense than it does now.thank you to netgalley and berkley publishing for the arc 💓'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Can a book survive on nothing but banter? Well,Funny Storysure tries.Okay, all you rabid Emily Henry fans. Before you chuck your rotten eggs at me, please let me explain.If ever there was an Emily Henry book that I should connect with, it's this one. Daphne is a librarian (my dream job) and she's in a pretend relationship with her roommate, Miles, in order to get back at her ex-fiancé (an intriguing premise). And yet, something was missing. I kept waiting for the story to grab me, and it never really did.I hate to say it, but the crux of the problem is that the whole thing was rather forgettable. I only just finished the book, and already I hardly remember anything about it. The characters, the interactions, even the conflicts, while all feelgood on the surface, were in fact fairly bland underneath.I enjoy a low-stakes beach read as much as the next gal, but there is a difference between low stakes and no stakes, and this was too much in the latter. At no point was there anything really on the line. The story just shambled along, with lots of banter and some minor conflicts here and there, until the requisite 300-some pages were met, and then it was called a book.Speaking of the conflicts, I totally didn't understand Daphne and Miles' issues, or even Daphne and Ashleigh's. Do people really get so upset and potentially break up relationships and friendships over such small issues? And each one, blown up to be so important, can only be resolved after much back and forth, with pages upon pages of dialogue of each person's feelings and the associated parental trauma that was at the root of all their misgivings. It was a bit much.Don't get me wrong, I did have fun. There were entertaining moments, and the banter was truly top notch. And it wasn't just for the main couple during romantic moments. No, the banter was interspersed everywhere and among everyone, so we got plenty of chuckle-worthy moments.But you can't just sustain a story on banter alone, no matter how delightful it is. When the characters feel as lackluster as Daphne and Miles and their conflicts equally bland and forced, it was hard to care either way if they ended up together, which is always a bad sign in a romance.I feel like I'm the only person out there who doesn't get heart-eyes at the merest mention of an Emily Henry book. My experiences so far have been largely underwhelming, or maybe I just haven't read the right books by her. Either way, I'll add this to the pile of Emily Henry books I've pretty much forgotten the moment I finished.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:Beach ReadPeople We Meet on Vacation~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'funny story? ha. ain’t nothing funny about the way my heart was tugged while reading this book. emily henry im under your bed cuz why’d you write a fmc that has the same thoughts and fears as me?!? 💀opposites attract has never been written better than before this. Daphne and Miles were written for each other like a prophecy. this is one of emily’s most horniest books yet, and i was there for it all the way through. “his mouth is still cool from the lemonade, his breath tinged with hints of lavender, and his hand slides around to the small of my back, fisting into my shirt…” i love these descriptions. there was something very tender when he said “always so buttoned up” to Daphne, who’s a librarian, as he was ripping her clothes off. 🫶🏽i just know if i had an attentive, calm, loving, cherishing, beautiful man like Miles in my life he’d be extremely manly to the point where i can turn off my brain, be a girly girl, and not have a worry in the world. his gentle love felt like a caress to my soul. the way he effortlessly took care of her, saw the signs, respected her space and mind. Miles…YOU GOT IT LIKE THAT?!? he makes me feel like im standing in sunlight☀️lives were changed when Miles said, “ I know I’m not who you pictured yourself with, but I think I could be, eventually.

Sometimes, just when it feels like smooth sailing on the raft you call a life, an unexpected fucker of a wave smashes your plans to splinters and send you off course and adrift. Such is the case for Daphne in Emily Henry’s charming new novel,Funny Story, whose life has been shipwrecked upon the shores of a Lake Michigan vacation town with the ex of her ex’s new fiance. You read that right, and these mutual exes are such a smart match they are practically named after each other, Peter and Petra, so out with the tweed and in with the twee I suppose. But, as Daphne learns, sometimes a shipwreck can be a new start to something more beautiful. One of this books biggest strengths in allowing the narrative to wade through sorrows to create a portrait of adults discovering how to carry their own baggage and how their interactions with others are affected by it with a lot of the drama not being a miscommunication trope, per say, but more people tripping themselves up into confirmation bias based on their own personal traumas. It has some grit that grounds the otherwise breezy narrative and the real love story is learning to love oneself in order to love and be loved. It does wrap up a bit overly idyllic but honestly, I felt the biggest cracks in the veneer of the story was when it tried to make things happier than it probably needed to be but I understand why that is the case. With her signature witty banter, wry humor, and characters that are easy to fall in love with as they fall apart and into love themselves,Funny Storyis a endearing tale about picking up the pieces only to discover oneself amidst the wreckage, learn to be yourself for yourself, and find a love where you least expect.‘The same universe that dispassionately takes things away can bring you things you weren't imaginative enough to dream up.’Alright let’s talk about love and stuff (surprise: the “stuff” is trauma!) I foundFunny Storyto read as a much quieter novel than most of Emily Henry’s works, but also found that, coupled with a slow-burn plot that lets scenes and character introspection really breathe, to be part of what made it so endearing for me. This will probably take some criticism for being slow but my favorite books are the sort that don’t exactly have what most people call a “plot” soooo this was fine for me.Funny Storyreads more along the lines of the coziness inBook Loverswhile also being more successful than I foundHappy Placeto be. Having just readLynn Painter’sHappily Never After, I felt like this was a successful version of the many things that story tried to be (both books, however, have a thing about eating pizza being sexy which…ok…???) where the characters actually felt their age, the fake dating felt plausible, the third act drama was passably believable for the genre. It does try to tie up too many loose ends and solve all the issues and I don't think we needed that, but I suppose cliches are cliche for a reason and there are expectations in genres so thats more a Me thing. And like, sure there's a lot to pick at but also it’s aiming to be a fun book and it lands that aspect while also managing to have a dynamic look at how past hurts can haunt our self-esteem and hinder our vulnerability when trying to connect with others and that helped hold the story together. One person's breakdown is another person’s novel glue I guess? Wait, I think I just finally understood literature.‘You can't force a person to show up, but you can learn a lesson when they don't.’This is a fairly character driven narrative of self-discovery and trauma processing that just so happens to stumble into romance so having the characters be in their early 30s helped bring this to life. Also that everything sucks and they just keep having to go to work and smile because they work public facing jobs–I FELT THAT SO HARD. I’ve found in similar novels that the characters felt far too young for their ages whereasFunny Storycaptures being an adult but not having the stable career/family/housing/etc that would make one “feel adult.” It's a very Millennial narrative where jokes like ‘are we evil or just immature?’ to laugh off behavior felt very true to life and all these characters seemed to walk onto the page directly out of the sort of single, early 30s service industry folks I’ve known and been friends with. But it also positions the characters in the wreckage of their Round 1 attempt at adulthood where they can no longer pretend they aren’t a product of their past and have to weigh out how their past traumas and coping mechanisms have embedded into their personalities. Especially since both Miles and Daphne are still reeling from hurts caused by the actions of their parents and don’t have a healthy relationship to serve as a compass for their own (and Daphne’s father is still a source of constant disappointment). ‘I don’t want you to look at me like I’m broken,’ Miles says at one point and this cuts to the heart of how these character’s present themselves: eager to show they are alright while feeling far from fine inside and wanting to hide that.’It’s easy to be loved by the ones who’ve never seen you fuck up. The ones you’ve never had to apologize to, and who still think all your ‘quirks’ are charming.’Since so much of dating involves understanding each other’s defense mechanisms and unpacking how past traumas inform your interpersonal relationships, being able to be vulnerable is important to intimacy andFunny Storydoes well by showing how frustrating it can be to open yourself up at the same emotional places where you are currently bruised. Though, speaking of intimacy, readers should know Emily Henry is not a closed-door romance writer (as Ashleigh says it is ‘definitely not PG’) and while the sex scenes are fairly awkward here (I suspect the term “cringe” will get used in a lot of reviews) I think thats part of their charm as these are just…awkward people. Henry wrote a rather humorous article (read itHERE) on how to write sex scenes and the key detail she returns to several times is vulnerability and embracing the awkward, but also using the scenes to progress the characters.‘The scene has to change things. Because every scene has to change things.And that’s it. As close as I think I could get teaching someone to write (or rewrite) a sex scene. You have to treat it like any other scene, because that’s what it is…It has to move the story. It has to shift the emotional landscape. It doesn’t have to be universally deemed sexy (it can’t; people like different things) and it doesn’t have to avoid the territory of cringe (it won’t, for the aforementioned reason). It simply has to be true to the story.’While I’m not sure the scenes here really count as plot progression, I found the awkwardness that leaves the characters rather flustered and confused about their relationship to work as part of the character study that seems to be the focus of this book. Its a novel about finding yourself but thankfully its not white folks “finding themselves” by going to India or Joshua Tree listening to The Doors, its just getting high and watching action movies with your roommate and getting some “accidental” action of your own.‘She’s a walking fantasy and I’m a librarian who actually does wear a lot of buttons and tweed.’Learning to love oneself in all your faults and failures is difficult, but the joy in the discovery of what makes you “you” comes alive through Daphne quite well. The set up is pretty great and Henry launches you into it rather quickly. I do enjoy how it sort of mimics the set up inBook Loverswhere she gets dumped in a very romcom ending “I realized my best friend was my love all along” way like Daphne is the discard fiance that barely gets any lines and seems lame anyways (so I guess shoutout to anyone who maybe identified with Mark Ruffalo’s fiance in13 Going On 30?). This is just another incident in a long line of feeling not important in the lives of those who claim to love you, and having had an absentee father taught her a few self-defense mechanisms long ago:‘Trust people’s actions, not their words.Don’t love anyone who isn’t ready to love you back.Let go of the people who don’t hold on to you.Don’t wait on people who don’t jury for you.’Being free from a relationship she thought would sail her happily from life has also made her reflect on how she never really formed a solid sense of self and instead allowed a relationship to fill in all the blanks for her. ‘I always cleaved to people I love and tried to orient my orbit around them,’ she realizes, which was an attempt to ‘make myself unleavable.’ And guess what? They all left. But now she has a new opportunity to find herself in it all.‘Im not sure which parts of me are him and which parts are genuinely my own and I want to know. I want to know myself, to test my edges and see where I stop and the rest of the world begins.’Having also ended up in a Michigan lakeshore vacation town only for my supposedly “got it together” lifeplans to go down like the Edmund Fitzgerald (if you are from Michigan you are required to love the Edmund Fitzgerald and think of the Great Lakes like some fierce god that gives life but takes it away. Any museum is like “Science/Art/History/etc is so cool!” Michigan museums are like “the Lake is a cruel mistress who will kill you and everyone you love!”), this all resonated with me. Too much maybe. But I loved seeing her come to love it and find her own place. ‘I feel embarrassing pride at having become a regular at someplace new all on my own,’ she thinks about becoming a familiar face in a coffee shop. Can confirm that is a cool feeling when you feel utterly alone in the world. Good for you, Daphne, find your place.‘There’s no place on this earth like Waning Bay.’Speaking of place, Emily Henry excels at capturing a sense of place and embedding it into her narratives as if the local community itself were a supporting cast character in her romcoms. It helps, too, that her locales tend to offer plenty of comedic relief along with their atmosphere. Henry has spoken at length about the importance of “place” in crafting her novelsin interviews, stating that ‘I want my characters to feel like they grew up in the place where [my books are] set.’ InFunny Story, however, we watch Daphne as she has to learn a new place being stuck in a Northern Michigan vacation community, but it is less the way learning a place is about learning to better understand her love interest as it was inBook Loversand more about learning to understand herself. Luckily she is aided by her new roommate, Miles, who also had to find his way amidst this community after shipwrecking there himself (can relate, buddy). Henry captures these Michigan communities in highly specific and humorous ways while making it still relatable to those unfamiliar with them. Maybe I’m biased and Daphne being a librarian and Miles being a bartender at a cherry themed wine bar is just something I’d enjoy because I work in a library after having myself been a wine bartender at a cherry themed establishment. But aspects of Michigan vacation towns felt so true to life. I laughed at the bar named “BARn” which is so eye-rollingly Michigan. But also aspects like seeing a young couple that are ‘on a first date which might somehow be an actual vacation,’ or everyone having their “corn guy, jam connection or cheesemonger, or someone saying things like being on the water is probably what church is to some folks. But for real, if you need amazing tomatoes, I know a guy.‘A good librarian makes all the difference.’The side characters are great as well, like the younger sister who brings in a lot of heartfelt discussions on family dynamics in response to family traumas, or the single-mom librarian. The library aspects are a bit kitschy but charming and I’m glad Henry presents the very real issues of how much blatant sexual harassment librarians face or the random moments of extreme anger or weirdness and how we just…deal with it and move along like a blip in the day. I usually hate when authors add libraries or librarians into plots because it's so stereotypically twee or inaccurate but Henry pulls it off well. Back to the sister for a moment, I thought the age gap between siblings was explored in a pretty comically-true-to-life way and how it wasn’t miscommunication between them but just…lack of communicating at all because you just assume what the other person is thinking. Which, okay real. That plays into the third act drama as well where its less a miscommunication and more falling victim to your own confirmation bias and assumptions. But Miles is sweet. I really liked Miles, guys. Miles feels like people I've met, especially in my bartending days. Also a coworker told me they think Miles is based on me. He’s not, I don’t own crocs (shoutout to the cover artist for including that). Did he do something sort of uncool at the end that Daphne is understandably upset about? Yes. Not great. But also did it feel like...well, something you'd hear a friend tell you about why their mad at a guy? Absolutely.I also don't know if this actually needed a successful romance? Maybe that's just me but the aspect about loving yourself and existing outside the circle of your partner was pretty great and we could have left it at that.‘A second act I fell into, and the home that I chose, as much as it chose me.I can’t wait. I can’t wait for this whole world I’ve invited to surprise me.’All in all,Funny Storyis a sweet story of summer, libraries and finding joy in a new town and new friend. What I really loved about this book—even when it made me cry because Isobbedat the end—is how it just felt like people interacting with people and stumbling through their own issues instead of having some driving plot pushing people in directions. What I’m getting at is they felt like people instead of chess pieces for the sake of plot. The third act drama is done well too. Though when Henry tries to tell you that Michiganders refer to vacationers as “fudgies” for coming here to get our fudge (which is yum)...no we don’t. But the people from the Upper Peninsula DO in fact call the lower Peninsula “trolls.” Nobody in this novel says “ope” though, which is the Michigan noise for everything. Daphne should have said “ope” during a sex scene, I would have fallen over and then made this novel the State flag or something. Anyways, I enjoyed this and I hope you will too.4/5‘Family. The real kind, who will always love you, even when your decisions make no sense to them.’UPDATE: I totally bought the Emily Henry merch shirt for this book.

This was such a good story, I loved following it and it was genuinely just cute. Her writing was just smooth and buttery.I usually don't like the FMC in romances (but I've only really read Ali Hazelwood and all her characters are the same person in different fonts) - but she was really relatable and I was rooting for her the whole time. Her whole 'finding herself journey' was so wholesome and heartwarming to follow. I relate to her relationship with her mother, and with finding friends. I think I do the same thing too, but I just didn't know how to express it until Emily Henry put it into words. I rarely sink the time into people and just conclude they'll be an acquaintance.Miles is a top tier guy, I would totally date him in real life and he'd give me so many butterflies - I'd also think he was being 'just nice' like Daphne did and not that he actually liked me.I love Julia and Ashleigh as well - such girls girls, I would love to have friends like them. I'm genuinely so proud of Daphne, it makes my heart so fuzzy and warm.

Miles didn’t have any outstanding or charming qualities in my opinion and i was pretty indifferent about him for the majority of the book. i thought he would win me over eventually, but eh, he never did.the story itself was not the bestest and most interesting i’ve ever read, but the positive thing is that it was keeping me somewhat entertained. even with its issues, i was not bored and i wanted to keep reading more and more. i even started feeling a tad hopeful that things would improve at some point because i could see some potential there. but guess what? it did not improve. in fact, it got worse.i don’t know where exactly things started going wrong, all i can tell you is that after 50% i lost all my interest in the story.i assume it might be because of the romance. Daphne and Miles started having more “romantic” scenes and i was not interested in that. not even a little bit. from the beginning, i couldn’t feel any chemistry between them and their romantic interactions were all so cringe and unnatural to me. just unpleasing to read. so yeah, it actually makes sense why i lost interest when they really started becoming more than friends.i genuinely enjoyed the friendship between these two, their dynamic as friends was fun and sweet, but as a couple? oh, absolutely NOT. when i read romance books i surely expect to root for the main characters to end up together, because duh, butFunny Storymade me do the exact opposite. Daphne and Miles should’ve stayed as friends and friends only and i’ll die on this hill. no one can convince me otherwise. it’s not even just because i think they havezerochemistry, there are another million reasons why i think that that they shouldn’t be a couple. the biggest one is that neither of them were very prepared to embark in another serious relationship so quickly (nor they should). they should take care of themselves first and get therapy instead.on top of that, the author also started coming up with unnecessary and tedious subplots. like for example the dad subplot — the most boring — and i just... couldn’t take it anymore. i was getting more and more annoyed and the urge to give up was very strong at that point, but i kept pushing through. i don’t know why, though? it wasn’t even worth it.then... when i thought it couldn’t get any worse... the author throws in a ✨third act conflict✨ and what a stupid, irritating third act conflict it was. was it even necessary? it came out of nowhere and the whole thing felt way too forced and annoying.i got so angry at Miles’ actions and i don’t think Daphne was that wrong or immature for reacting the way she did. the conflict just proves my point that they! were! not! ready! for! a! relationship! (well, mainly Miles.)ironically, for a book calledFunny Story, this wasn’t funny at all. it’s not the worst book i’ve ever read (trust me when i say i’ve read worse) but it’s not one of the best either... it was just not for me i guess. i still recommend it, though — i feel like others might like it more than me. i certainly hope they do.𓂃 ⚝ 𓂃 ๋. ₊ ꒰ ✉️favorite quotes. ꒱ ₊ . ๋ 𓂃 ⚝ 𓂃“The same universe that dispassionately takes things away can bring you things you weren't imaginative enough to dream up.”“You can’t untell someone your secrets.

You can't unsay those delicate truths once you learn you can't trust the person you handed them to.”➛ this book also talks about some parental abuse that i honestly do not think i’ve ever read about before, and i know it is going to mean a lot to a lot of people. also the way that miles handles that trauma in the present day was something that really made me feel seen and meant more to me than i have words to put in a review here.“I need it to be okay. Because I need to be okay. As a kid, I just felt so fucking scared and powerless, all the time, and now, I just need to be okay.”➛ and this is also just such a book about community, and carving out space and safety and love with the people who you trust and want to build a home with. especially when you’ve lived a life of not really having much stability, and the thought of it being taken away makes you scared to start to build it.➛ libraries will always be the heart of cities, with some of the most powerful tools we have to amplify voices and create change. i am actually typing this up during national library week here, and i just can't emphasize enough how important these buildings, these safe spaces filled with heart, and these librarians are. i would get so emotional when daphne would talk about the kids at her branch, and the books she’d pick because of them. ahhhh, a reminder to just show up for your local library, do donations if you are able (time, books, and money), make sure your library card is updated, just show your appreciation in every way you’re able to.“To me, libraries have always represented the best of humanity. The way we all share knowledge and space, and... and how we find ways to look after each other. It's not a perfect system, but it's powerful.”overall, this just had so much to love. actually, as i am typing this i am considering making this a five star. I’m just not sure if i loved this as much asbeach read, but it is for sure a new favorite emily henry of mine. but miles is for sure the best love interest she, or maybe any other contemporary author, has ever written. and i absolutely cannot wait to watch you all fall with both him, and daphne, and their amazing funny story.trigger + content warnings:drinking, smoking, a joke about suicide, brief mention of fetishization (to a side character and in a negative light), parental abandonment and neglect and and instability in past, child abuse in past, mention of loss of parents in past (side character), one sentence mention of cancer (side characters parent), anxiety depiction, and just a story about people going through a really hard break up that has a little bit of infidelity vibes (even though no cheating did occur to them)♡evie'samazing spotify playlistblog|instagram|youtube|wishlist|spotify|amazon♡Beach Read★★★★♡Happy Place★★★""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""“I don’t know how to talk along the surface of things, but I also don’t want to unearth the ugly stuff, over and over again, for people who are just passing through my life.

You can’t untell someone your secrets.

This isThe Tortured Poet's Departmentcoded with elements ofMidnightsin the second half of the book. This book was everything I didn't know I needed and I'm going to need Emily to write more contemporary romance books immediately.— The romance is a heavier focus compared to some of her other work, however it still had Emily's character driven stories, witty humour and introspection. This will be very subjective depending on your own personal connection to these characters and stories but I felt so seen in this book. This was a personal experience for me as it always is with Emily's books and I found it emotional at times.➳Daphneis up there with one of the most relatable FMC's for me. She's cynical about love and has been neglected by most people in her life. The romance was a large factor, but Daphne's fear of abandonment, parental issues and cynical nature gave me the emotional depth I crave in Emily's books. Daphne's abandonment issues are incredibly realistic and I got teary towards the end seeing how this has shaped her life.The Prophecyfrom TTPD this is so Daphne coded as she doesn't feel like she belongs anywhere with family, friends or relationships.“You can’t force a person to show up, but you can learn a lesson when they don’t. Trust people’s actions, not their words. Don’t love anyone who isn’t ready to love you back. Let go of the people who don’t hold on to you. Don’t wait on anyone who’s in no rush to get to you.”➳Milesis portrayed as the well-liked and free-spirited personality, however, he has a depth to him once he opens up. He's very patient and in tune with the emotions of people around him. He's an optimist and I loved how he turned Daphne's pessimistic statement's into something positive. I love his personality and banter so I will forgive him for wearing crocs all the time 🫣“It’s easy to be around people who don’t know you. But as soon as someone starts to figure you out—as soon as you can’t be perfect—it’s easier to move on. Find someone new to be the cool, fun, laid-back one with.”➳PeterandPetraare terrible people. I found Peter especially triggering. He's the guy that always wants what he doesn't have and can't let others be happy without him. Petra got off too easy for her behaviour.➳Ashleighis a side character but she offered a lot to this story. I loved thefound familyaspect she brought but also her own experiences also added depth to the story. I loved her moment with Daphne towards the end of the book which offered constructive feedback to Daphne's response to conflict.➳The romancehad me kicking my feet like a love-struck teenager. They were so adorable and the chemistry and tension was palpable. The angst was on nearly every page and while the sexual tension was amazing, it wasn't instant love and their relationship offered so much more than sexual chemistry. They did trauma bond to an extent at the start but it's very clear that their chemistry was not a consequence of the hand they were dealt. This is very loosely fake dating — It could had fallen into so many other tropes but I loved the direction Emily took and she really let the characters stand on their own.“I want to kiss you, every time you take a sip of something and make that sound. I want to kiss you every time I walk past your bedroom and hear your laugh through the door. I want to kiss you every time I hear the shower turn on and know that you’re in there. I want to kiss you all the time, Daphne. Sometimes it’s just easier to find an excuse.”— There's a conflict towards the end and people might have some mixed feelings about it. I personally thought it was realistic because I related to the characters I would have felt the same. I don't pick Emily's books up with the expectation of it being a fluffy. I crave the introspection so I was not disappointed. It goes without saying that her writing is beautiful and witty — she had me laughing, blushing and crying.

It came in second place in the Goodreads Choice Awards voting, but my thoughts haven’t changed! I loved it so, so, so much!OH MY GOODNESS! Finally, the literature gods heard my prayers! I’ve been longing for a fantastic romance, something heart-wrenching that shakes me to the core and makes me feel everything at once: happiness, angst, joy, forgiveness, enjoyment, resentment, and hurt. Yes, I LOVE THIS BOOK SO MUCH! I want to scream it! Oh, thankfully, I already did!I have to add: This is not a beach read. This is a GLUED READ. You don’t want to end it, and you don’t want to stop reading it, so you carry your book everywhere as if it’s one of your internal organs.I expected to read something more chic-lit, a soft, sweet story, but instead, I got an amazing work of fiction—a remarkable romance juggling so many themes at once: friendship, regrets, cancer, betrayal, dysfunctional families and their secrets, enemies to friends, friends to lovers, and rivalry between authors!The things I loved most:•\tSarcastic but smart, entertaining, unique dialogues between January and Gus.•\tThe soul-crushing, tear-jerking, heart-shattering, intense father-daughter relationship.•\tCaptivating storytelling from the beginning: I couldn’t put this book down. I devoured the pages (maybe I accidentally licked my Kindle, but its screen looks dustless, and I’m the grossest person right now!). I couldn’t stop reading about January and Gus’ growing attraction, their struggles to open up, their fears of getting hurt, and their stupid and childish actions toward each other. Yes, I had so many “awww” and sighing moments. My husband thought I was secretly ordering cases of French wine because I smiled so much, and I got an appointment with the surgeon because my smile was glued to my face, making me look like a worse version of the Joker right now! I cannot stop!•\tA witty plot: Two writers, nemeses from college, now have neighboring beach houses. They both have deadlines for their books but are suffering from writer’s block! Gus thinks that happily-ever-afters don’t exist, but he can push himself to write about it, and January could write some high-rated, complex fiction instead of swoony romances! So they bet and switch genres, but to do that, they need to spend time together, experiencing both the bright and dark sides of life. This means January will take Gus to carnivals, romantic beaches, and field trips to watch the sunset, while Gus will take January hiking in graveyards or arrange an interview with a grieving woman who lost her sister to a death cult. See? It was impossible not to get hooked from the beginning!•\tCharacterization: January and Gus seem like polar opposites—one a pessimist who had a problematic childhood with his abusive father, and the other an optimist who loves to see the brighter side, even though her childhood was overshadowed by her mother’s battle with cancer. They are both suffering from loneliness and wrong choices in their love lives. Actually, they have so much in common, not to mention the SIZZLING CHEMISTRY and UNDENIABLY GROWING ATTRACTION!THE LAST PARTS OF THE BOOK: Oh boy! Please prepare your napkins, paper towels, anything to dry your non-stop dripping tears! I’m not giving spoilers, but Ms. Henry is an emotional torturer who knows exactly how to sing to our hearts, break them into pieces, and then magically gather and heal each piece with her soul-brushing, poignant words. She is a heart whisperer. She knows how to melt your heart!OVERALL: This is not only one of my favorite books of this year but also one of my all-time favorite romance books! I’m so happy my craving for a well-written romantic fiction is over!Special thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing this year’s one of the best books’ ARC copy with me in exchange for my honest review. And Emily Henry, thank you for reaching my heart with your effective, soul-touching, and talented work.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, and astrology:Medium BlogInstagramFacebookTwitter'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'His eyes were doing the thing, the Gus thing . . . and it made my chest flutter almost painfully.I don\'t get it. What am I missing here?Beach Readoriginally caught my eye because its premise reminded me ofSummer Villa, one of my favorite Hallmark movies. I know, I\'m publicly admitting to being a sappy romantic at heart. And I\'m proud of it. So why couldn\'t I get into this story at all?For one, I didn\'t feel any chemistry between January and Gus. Nothing. Their interactions are so awkward and stilted, it was almost painful. They\'ll say mundane and platonic things to each other, and then sporadically, January will remind us that heat is filling her abdomen or pooling between her legs, and I\'m like, Eh? I can\'t imagine how two people could possibly fall in love or lust while saying such bland things to each other.This is the second book I\'ve read by Emily Henry, and I\'ve noticed that her female characters tend to be very twee and precious. They have extremely high expectations of what love is, need to be constantly reassured, and freak out at the smallest blip. At one point, January sees Gus\'s ex at a public event and she wants to scream and cry, before the woman has even said or done anything. And what\'s up with calling herself ""dumb bunny""? Not to mention, she spends the entire time being upset with her dad over something that was none of her business. Suffice to say, it\'s all very exhausting.As for Gus, we are told over and over that he has a crooked mouth and messy hair, wears rumpled and faded clothes, and has a sexy/evil look (what does that even mean?). Otherwise, his only characteristics are that he writes novels, and he adores January for no reasons that I could discern.The writing style is fluffed out to the excess. There is so much mundane details about every event/non-event, from the multiple-page conversations on should they go or not go, to the logistical details (transportation/gift bringing/preferred topics of conversation) to the minutiae of everything that happens while at the event. And in between, every step of the way, it is interspersed with information on how January is feeling, how she thinks Gus must be feeling, and what this means for their relationship.They are also constantly affirming what great people the other one is. Gus is dark and broken, but great! January is a fairy princess and a bright light, but great too! And they keep checking in to see if the other is happy. Like, are you happy? I am, are you happy? The conversations were so cheesy and trite, I was crying on the inside.A good portion of this book is spent on the details of the stories they are each writing and their related research. One is a love story that takes place in a cult and the other is a love story that takes place... in a circus with clowns? I don\'t even know what I\'m reading anymore.Where is the flirty banter, the sexual tension, the obstacles to overcome? I kept waiting for something exciting to happen, or some interesting dialog, or some insight from this story. But nada. I\'ll be honest, this is one of the most boring books I\'ve ever read.My criteria for a romcom isn\'t that high. I want romance and comedy, but this book didn\'t satisfy either. I neither swooned nor laughed. I was mostly exhausted from boredom while waiting for this dull story to be over.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:People We Meet on VacationFunny Story~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'I didn\'t like this book as much as I thought I would, and that makes me sad.I had this as a five star prediction, one of my most anticipated of the year because this premise sounds PERFECT to me. I love books that follow writers, and I love the idea of two writers swapping genres and competing to sell their book first and have a kind of hate to love vibe but also being really cute still. When I started reading this I was certain it was going to be a five star read, and trust me no one is as bummed a I am that I didn\'t absolutely love this. I wanted to be obsessed with it the way I am with Unhoneymooners and The Hating Game, but this book just isn\'t it...This book started off fine, I actually really like January\'s character in the beginning. I feel like Gus, the live interest is one of my issues with the book. He comes off as kind of pretentious at times, and he has this attitude like ""i\'m so broken that nobody can ever understand me"" and he doesn\'t believe in happy endings, he\'s such a cliche stereotypical brooding moody man character.I feel like the mood of this book was all over the place, because some of it was trying to be light and fluffy \'beach read\' as the title implies, but then some of it was actually dark, like January finding out her recently dead Father was cheating on her Mom her whole life, and Gus making them do all these interviews with people from a cult for writing research, or people who\'s siblings killed themselves... like some of it got really dark so the tone of the book would shift constantly and it just didn\'t flow.I feel like some of their banter was freaking amazing and *chefs kiss*, but then some of their banter, especially towards the middle felt so forced and like the author was trying too hard to make them seem cute. I feel like January\'s character was wayyyyyy too insecure about some things, like damn Gus made a comment about her being a fairy princess at the beginning of the book and she literally brings it up constantly throughout the entire book.I feel like Gus\'s type of male character is annoying because he basically admits he was only an asshole to her because he was in love with her, and like that\'s obnoxious. I hate how also after the first time they have sex he basically tells her to leave when he gets an important phone call, such a dick move. And then he goes from being kind of an asshole to being like \'i\'m in love with you\' so freaking quickly, it was cringey. And the actual ending, the last chapter was so cheesy. Of course it ends with a cheesy proposal, like every other romance novel out there.I also wanted more of their stories they were writing, because that is what made me so interesting in reading this in the first place, I was especially curious about Gus\'s romance novel and I just wish we got more information about the books they were writing.So what did I love about this book?I loved the first 100-150 pages, I lovedsomeof the banter, I loved the scenes of them actually writing (I just really love reading about writers as an aspiring writer), I love the complicated relationship between January and her now dead Father, I love the competitive-ness between January and Gus when they are trying to write something outside of their usual genre that would still sell.I guess I just had too high of expectations for this after hearing the premise and there was just something about this book that didn\'t quite click with me, and I\'m sad about it.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'This was a fun read, but just that. At least for me. I read the synopsis and I was so excited, it sounded like a romance I NEEDED to read. I mean, the main characters are both authors that write totally opposite genres and they develop sort of a enemies to lovers relationship? I WAS SO IN. But sadly, I found it a little boring.I may be the exception here. I\'ve only read GREAT reviews for this one. Maybe it is because I\'m not that into romance stories? SURE, I love romance IN my stories, just not so much if it\'s the main theme. But sometimes it can happens that a romance books sweeps me away and makes me swoon. Examples:- To all the boys I\'ve loved before- The Hating Game- Red, White & Royal BlueSo yes, there are a few romance books that I love, and I\'m always trying to find the next one to add to that list, and I was hoping this was it. But it was not.Nevertheless, it wasn\'t bad, I really enjoyed some parts and I was rooting for the main characters! And I really liked the dare. So: January is a romance author and Gus is writes dark literary fiction, and they dare each other to write the thing the other one usually writes! That\'s the sinopsys and it sounded awesome. It was kinda awesome.But yeah, I didn\'t like the book as much as everyone else. The middle part dragged a bit to much and the way Gus handled the situation when things were getting hard was frustrating. And it wasn\'t a good kind of frustration, it was one that made me go: ugh STOP. Anyway, everyone is loving this book, so my opinion is an unpopular one.. . .Español:Esta fue una lectura divertida, pero sólo eso. Por lo menos para mí. Leí la sinopsis y estaba súper emocionada, ¡sonaba como el romance que necesitaba leer YA! Es decir, ¿los personajes principales son autores que escriben géneros totalmente opuestos y van desarrollando una relación estilo enemies to lovers? SÍ, DAME POR FAVOR. Pero tristemente, me terminó aburriendo un poco.Creo que soy la excepción aquí, pues sólo he leído reseñas EXCELENTES de este libro. Tal vez sea porque no me encantan los libros de romance. Sí, amo el romance DENTRO de las historias que leo, pero no me gusta mucho que sea el tema central. Eso sí, a veces pasa que uno que otro libro de romance me toma por sorpresa y me enamora. Ejemplos:- A todos los chicos de los que me enamoré- Cariño, cuánto te odio- Rojo, Blanco y Sangre AzulAsí que sí, hay algunos pocos libros de romance que amo, y siempre estoy intentando encontrar el nuevo ""ROMANCE QUE CLAU AMA"" para agregar a la lista. Esperaba que este lo fuera. Pero no.De todos modos, no estuvo mal. Disfruté mucho de algunas partes y sí quería que los personajes principales quedaran juntos. ¡Y de verdad me gustó mucho el reto! O sea: January es autora de romance y Gus escribe ficción literaria muy oscura, y se retan a escribir lo que el otro suele escribir. Esa es la sinopsis y sonaba increíble. Sí lo fue un poco, la verdad.Pero sí, al final, este libro no me gustó tanto como a otros. La parte de en medio se alargó mucho y me frustraba bastante cómo Gus manejaba la situación cuando las cosas se ponían difíciles. Y no era una frustración de la buena, era más como: ugh ya basta. Jajajaja. En fin, soy minoría aquí, todo el mundo está amando el libro.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'I did what any reasonable adult woman would do when confronted with her college rival turned next-door neighbor. I dove behind the nearest bookshelf.I really needed this book. I didn\'t realize how much I needed it until I was giggling along with all the awkwardness and banter and feeling like I\'d been taken away from the dark, dreariness of this lockdown. It\'s exactly what it seems to be: a very cute, sweet romance.Beach Readis a warm, summery story about a romance writer (January Andrews) and a vair vair serious literary writer (Augustus Everett) who have been long-time writing rivals ever since they attended college together. They find themselves in neighboring beach houses for the summer, each trying to write their next novel whilst doling out perfect comebacks to each other. What could possibly happen?As they get to know each other a little better, they decide to strike a deal: Augustus will write a happily ever after and January will turn her talents to the serious world of literary fiction. Whoever sells their manuscript first, wins.I really enjoyed the dynamic between January and Gus. It\'s not quite love/hate because the author stops short of really making them tear into each other, but there\'s a lot of tension created by their competitive history. The banter is funny; a little snarky at times, but good-natured. Emily Henry has also perfected that blend of broody and sweet with Gus-- it turns out Romance love interests can be both darkly mysterious and not assholes. Who\'da thought?The story is told entirely from January\'s POV, which I personally like. I prefer single perspective romance novels because I think a good portion of the tension comes from not knowing what\'s going on inside the other person\'s head.I will say that I might have been more critical of some aspects of this if I was in a different mindset right now. While I expected the novel to be cute and a little cheesy, it is a bit more cheesy and sentimental than I usually prefer. I would have been happier without things like this:""I don\'t need snowflakes."" He kissed me. ""As long as there\'s January.""I also expected it to be a little more saucy, lol. There’s sex scenes, for sure, but they’re cute and kinda dorky rather than tense and exciting. I know that a lot of people prefer that; I just thought the whole competing authors dynamic was pretty hot and would have liked to see that played upon a bit more. And I loved the jokey banter… I just sorta wanted them to stop the jokey banter DURING sex.But, fuck it. This was such a heartwarming feel-good book. I had a good time, that\'s all I can say.Facebook|Instagram'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'everybody knows i love emily henry.like, it’s probably gotten to the point that people who don’t know anything about me or read my reviews know that. probably the people who do all they can to avoid my crossing their digital path (and i imagine these people must exist judging by the number of john green fans i’ve angered alone) know it too.it’s just that true. it\'s at the core of my identity.i love her and i shout it from the rooftops on the reg.i was very, very, veryveryvery excited to hear she was doing a rom-com, way outside her then-usual genre of Young Adult Magical Realism About Funny Brave Prickly Young Women Who Have Magic Or Are Magic Or Are Uniquely Capable Of Seeing Magic, And Their Funny Fun Unique Bands Of Friends.(my favorite genre.)

The stories they wrote took up a decent chunk of the plotline, in terms of research, and I just could not begin to care about their WIP or Augustus' out-there cult book.I also just did not feel connected to January's past relationship with a seemingly perfect man named Jacques who seemed like a placement character whose existence is for the purpose of making January seem like a well-rounded character with a ~dark past~. I wish I could have connected to her character more, but there just was something missing that I can't put my finger on.I don't know.

It’s not a bad book by any means! What’s unique about Emily Henry’s approach with romance is that her books feel less like a story revolving around relationships and more of a story focusing on individuals who come together and heal together. I appreciated the depth and internal struggles that the characters faced outside the relationship. For some reason though, I wasn’t feeling the romance.

And it was.But it was also so much more than that.The two main characters here (January and Gus) were both going through some shit that felt real and nuanced. There was a depth to them that was tangible. And the setting - while seemingly plucked straight out of a Nicholas Sparks book - never felt contrived or cliche.The romance (and so many other elements in the book usually considered trope-y in chick-lit or women\'s fiction) was written with a tongue-in-cheek hilarity that on one hand called itself out, and on the other, served to undercut any sense of the cliche.I was really impressed with Emily Henry\'s writing and style. I enjoyed her ability to flirt with the fourth wall and turn certain things on their head in a manner that made you laugh at it, but also seriously consider it at the same time.I also really enjoyed all the discussions on writing and the literary/popular culture jokes and references sprinkled throughout the story.In short, I loved every moment of this book and will definitely be reading more from this author in the future.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Re-read 10/14/20: nothing compares 2 (jan)u(ary + gus)Original read 3/25/20: Easily my favorite book of the year so far.

This emotionally adept read was everything I didn’t know Ineededat this very moment.Utilizing her engaging and clever wordplay,Emily Henrybrings readers into the lives of two very different writers. There’s January Andrews, a once optimist romance writer, battling her own heart while slogging through a bout of writer’s block. And then there’s Augustus (Gus) Everett, a twice published literary author, all broody and mysterious, fighting creative demons of his own. A mix of crappy circumstances and serendipity find January in a lake house for the summer and next-door neighbors to her college rival, Gus.While there are some lust-filled memories for her to conjure from college, January knows behind that sexy, evil grin of his grumpy Gus has never taken her writing seriously. In an attempt to banish the writer’s block, and prove they can write in each other’s respective genres, a challenge ensues. And it’s not your typical love/hate battle. It’s a tit-for-tat, sarcastic tease fest that made me laugh, brought me to tears, and ramped up the pitter-patter of this optimist heart of mine.Henry is masterful in her unraveling of both characters, really getting down to the crux of who January and Gus are, and more importantlywhy. Proving assumptions can be the inhibitor of joy. And while this story is told entirely from January’s perspective, a heady mix of her goading, slipped secrets, and admissions from the man himself provide a glimpse into the soul oflovableGus. His heartfelt musings to January areeverything.“Before that.”Relatable, raw, and at times even a little awkward, January and Gus together managed to chip off a chunk of my heart to call their own. Witty exchanges paint the pages and provide the perfect counterbalance to the hurt in their apprehensive hearts. Yet, it’s the undeniable connection they share, and the palpable tension clouding every nook and cranny around Gus and January that makes for such anunforgettableread.The title seems a bit ironic, givenBeach Readhas more substance or depth than it suggests. Considering the author’s level of biting humor throughout the novel and her exploration of the stereotypes swirling around the romance and women’s fiction genre, I assume this was purposeful. And very well played.If you pick up one love story this year, make it Gus and January’s.*Thank you, thank you, thank you to Berkley Publishing for access to an advanced copy via NetGalley.

It\'s a beautiful romance that has a lot of depth and emotion and I couldn\'t have loved it more.January and Gus are both published authors in neighboring beach homes. January just got to her late father\'s beach house and has a lot of questions. Her recent life events have put her in a bit of a funk when it comes to writing the romance she normally writes. Gus writes more serious literary fiction and they decide to switch genres as a bet to see who can write and sell a book first. To do this, they end up spending a lot of time together and go on adventures to help each other out.I loved the friendship January and Gus developed. Watching it change and grow was one of my favorite parts of this book. I loved how these two could be open and honest with each other and they challenged each other in the best ways.I was too much of a romantic for anything to stay casual, and even if we were totally incompatible, I was already in deeper with Gus than a purely physical attraction. And it seemed like neither of us could stop pushing the boundaries.Beach Readis witty, swoony, and hella romantic. It has a grumpy hero which I love and I seriously couldn\'t get enough of January and Gus together. Their \'dates\' left me with the biggest smile on my face and their chemistry and back and forth was the best. These characters and their story were complex.

This bookslaps.I’ve heard so many things about it, I’ve also read so many good reviews and then I justhadto get it. And immediately after I got it I dug into it andit felt right.Beach Readis not exactly the typical rom-com…and maybe it isn’t rom-com at all. It is contemporary romance, it is adult fiction and it is humorous, definitely. But it is more to it than just a good pun.What I mean to say is that the banter between January and Gus, the two main characters, is genuine and natural. And definitely witty. This book was made with a touch of the art of smart-mouthed dialogue and I loved it.Besides that, January is just a little bit of a clumsy girl and that definitely gives her the opportunity to star into little incidents that stimulate both laughter and the “Gee, she’s mood” kind of situations for us, the readers. You have no idea how many times I felt like locking myself in someone’s bathroom and drinking wine out of my purse until I am socially ready to mingle at a gathering.There are issues going deeper the surface plot of the book which makes it a little bit more complex and adds a tad of real-life situation, something like a healthy dose of reality within a dream.Both January and Gus are writers – completely opposites, I might add – but they somehow end up being neighbours and trying to challenge each other to step in each other’s shoes and write something completely different from what they normally do. And this is the perfect opportunity (or excuse) to fall in love, really.They spend so much time in each other’s company that they realise how lonely they are, in fact. And how hurt. And so, each other’s proximity helps with their individual growth.They both have some problems that darken their lives, trailing after them like needy shadows.Januaryused to romanticise everything around her, thinking that the world can be good, choosing to see the good and the happy and not the bad and the ugly. But finding out something not so pleasant about one of the most important people in her life shook her world. And she had to wake up from her pretty dream and see what’s in front of her – real life.Gusis cynical by his nature. He’s been through too much shit to actually see the love and the good in the world. When the world is harsh with you and tries to push you in a corner to beat you up with every chance it gets, it is not really one of your priorities in life to fall in love with unicorns. That’s probably why every ending in Gus’s novels is kind of bitter.Through their friendship, Gus and January learn to see the other halves of their glasses, the ones that they’ve been ignoring their entire lives – January learns that life is not always about happy-endings and Gus realises that there is love in the world even if it’s hidden away from sight.This book actually made me tear up a bit, I am not going to lie, I had to fight my tears back even though the urge to get up and get a tissue killed me.If I look at it better, I can say that this has been:- Funny and somehow relatable;- Sweet and tender;- A good dose of not-everything-is-perfect-but-it-could-be-worse reality;- Emotional and beautiful.I definitely think this is one of my favourite contemporary romance books and I am super happy that I actually made myself pick it up.

Scarlett Dragna, main character of the YA hit Caraval. You’re probably wondering how I ended up in this situation. If everysinglethingthathappenedinthiswholebook was anything to go by, it was through a combination of pointless lying, constant embarrassment, obsession with Some Guy, a big act of caring about a younger sister despite very little indication of that being true, unrelenting drama about a dumb wedding, repetitive interactions, weird descriptions, gender-based generalizations, and insanely personal info-dumps about emotional happenings from the past.(insert elegant bow here) And that, my dear friends, is my Scarlett Dragna impression. Thank you. Yes, thank you. Oh, please, stop with the standing ovation! I’m just like all of you. Except I possess such bitterness and have such a grasp of the future that I wrote a character description at the 25% mark, and god did it hold up.Yup. You guessed it. I didn’t like my most anticipated book of the year.https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...(What a surprise!you probably all chant in unison.)I almost felt guilty about writing a negative review about this book - because it’s about to be damn negative - but then I remembered it’s THIS BOOK’S FAULT. It marketed its damn self as a young adultThe Night Circus. It must take some serious goddamn gonads to look at a masterpiece, essentially magic with a front and back cover, and go, “Yeah. My book is just like that.” Spoiler alert: it’s really, really not.Oh, God, this review is going to be long. My bullet point list of notes alone is long. And I am putting away fruit snacks like nobody’s business, so I’ve got enough sugar in my system to sustain a lengthy burst of anger. Strap in, everybody! (Note from later: I sugar-crashed when I was almost done this review. But it did last me through most of it.)THE SETTINGAll I want is a good setting. All those times I said I just want a good characterto love and settle down with, I think - and relish this rare gift of a moment - I think I was wrong. I think I care most about settings. (Hence why books with magnificent settings get five star ratings no matter what.) And thus, it is my curse to eternally pick up every book that is compared to The Night Circus.This book does not have a good setting. It’s confusing: everything that seems solid is gone back on later. Nothing is real. That doesn’t lead to a good setting. But I’ll talk more about the constant, piece of sh*t cop-outs later in this review. It lacks the strong descriptions that a setting literally needs. It doesn’t feel magical at all. (More on that later, too.) But above all, it’s not goddamn GROUNDED.Haha. That GIF made me feel a little better. Thank you, my favorite person of all time forever, Bo Burnham. Anyway, as I was saying. This. Is. Not. Grounded. In Round 14 of 3947234829 why The Night Circus is better than this book and the latter should never have been compared, TNC takes place inour world. Yeah. The author (presumably) realized 1) maybe we need a little bit of magic! And 2) she couldn’t create one of the greatest settings of all time while also establishing a fantasy world. It would have weakened the whole book.But Stephanie Garber did NOT make the same choice. Instead, we’re unceremoniously dumped into a world where there are islands and colonizing empires and that CLASSIC YA trope of using clunky terms to differentiate the world from the real one (like Hot Season, because they don’t have WORDS FOR THE SEASONS). Even more fun, during this book characters travel between countries/colonies/islands/empires/I have no idea, and the reader has NO GODDAMN CLUE WHAT IS GOING ON.Alright, I think I’ve talked about the setting for too long. I see that now. But this is an UNFORGIVABLE OFFENSE, OK?THE CHARACTERSWe’re introduced to a world’s worth of characters here, and this book achieves quite a feat - they all manage to be either flat, boring, or both! Yaaaaay! I’m totally ready to try to pretend to feel emotionally connected to these goons for 400 pages!!First: Scarlett. Cannot believe we were trapped inside the head of the most boring character of all time throughout what was supposed to be a suspenseful thrill ride! (But, obviously, was not.) She’s easily embarrassed, obsessed with propriety, falls in pretty much instalove with Julian because he’s hot. Lies all the time because poor widdle gal is embarrassed of something or other about herself. Super weak. Constantly questioning her own reasoning and letting others make decisions for her. Tries to act like she’s a protective older sister, but, speaking as a protective older sister, she doesn’t give much of a sh*t about family when she’s staring into Julian’s eyes or literally sucking his fingers.But then we get into a whole different type of characters: Those who, by the end, we know NOTHING. ABOUT. Tella, Julian, Legend. We’re given descriptions of them that are gone back on, returned to, and gone back on again. Nothing is real. The whole thing is confusing and an absolute waste of energy. I came SO GODDAMN CLOSE to DNFing this book because it has about 100 twists andnone of them make sense.I wanted to shake myself out of a nightmare. What the hell was going on for 400 pages?!Beyond that, they’re boring and I don’t want to talk about them. And so were the “villains.” Scarlett and Tella’s dad is literally ruthless for no reason. His wife left him and now he plays psychological games of abuse with his daughters. There’s a moment where he essentially tries to get his daughter’s fiancé to rape her. And for what reason? It makes no sense. No sense at all. He slaps a random girl across the face at one point, murders some random dude. I don’t know what excuse to make for that except that this book is sloppy.THE PLOTWord to the wise...if you haven’t read this book, you may want to skip this section. Even the stuff I don’t mark as spoilers may be somewhat spoilery. I’ll try, kind of.So this book centers on Caraval, the supposedly wonderful setting I’ve already moped about for way too long. Caraval attracts a bunch - well, an unknown number of people, and is supposed to be a scavenger-hunt-style game. Somehow, though, in spite of the bajillion people who actually give a sh*t competing against her, Scarlett juststumblesinto the goddamn clues.Here’s my world famous (I’ve become famous since the beginning of this review, right?) Scarlett impression, coming back to show you what following her through this shindig feels like. “Oh, this terrible poem-slash-cheat sheet I was unceremoniously given says I have to ‘earn’ the next clue! It’s probably just this thing I randomly picked up along my travels with zero fanfare! Or maybe it has something to do with a situation I just stumbled into! Doesn’t matter which choice I make, somehow it’ll be manipulated into being the right one!” Where are the stakes?!I also feel like 80% of this is just us listening to boring old Scarlett being like, “Omg, I think Julian is lying to me. Whatever shall I do?! I don’t trust him!!! I just want to kiss his face off!!!” Etc, etc. And despite spending ALL OF HER TIME with him, she’s never just like:And when Scarlett’s piece of shit dad shows up with her fiancé to like, punch her in the stomach until she says she’ll make babies or whatever, she and luhhhhhhverboy have the DUMBEST REACTION. They get caught in a poor widdle thunderstorm, stop to make out for somewhere between 90 minutes and 7 hours, and get caught by the Dynamic Duo of Bad Characters…despite being about 1 f*cking yard away from an entrance to a hidden tunnel system.An entrance they knew about all along! I wish they both died.Also: two deaths, neither real, both anticlimactic and annoying. Not. A. Fan. That’s literally just a ploy to make it seem like your dumb book has the emotional depth it strives for. WHICH IT ABSOLUTELY DOESN’T.And this book is just one cop out after another. Weird choice to write a supposed ““““high fantasy”””” book without wanting to define your world at all! Everything that is said definitively is gone back on, so many conflicting descriptions of Caraval are given that I couldn’t summarize them if I tried, and on top of all that, we don’t even get answers at the Big Reveal.LANGUAGEThis book is written...weirdly. For one thing, Scarlett, in order to remind us of her special snowflake status, sees emotion in COLOR. It is straight up so annoying. Here are a handful of my least favorite instances, for your readinghorrorenjoyment.1. “She could see the sting of her rejection in shades of stormy blue, ghosting over his heart like sad morning mist.""2. “Periwinkle curiosity” (I don��t know why I hate that one so much. I just really do.)3. “It would have been a mistake to kiss him, yet she felt … disappointed. It came in cool shades of forget-me-not blue, which wrapped around her like evening fog, making her feel hidden enough to acknowledge that she wanted to experience more of Caraval’s pleasures than she would ever have admitted out loud.”Did you notice anything besides how irritating that quirk is? Numbers 1 and 3 are pretty much the DAMN SAME. What the hell?!The language in this book isn’t always AWFUL, it’s just...weird. Every sentence is very overwrought. Like, not everything has to have figurative language. Here’s my favorite example: The worst poem I have ever, ever read is in this book. And I’m an English major who hates poetry. Would you like to read it?""This girl was last seen with Legend.If you catch her, you shall catch him as well.Of course, you may have to venture through Hell.But if you succeed you may find yourself rich.This year’s winner will be granted one wish.""I do have to give this book some props, because this is the first time I have ever had to shut a book for 90 seconds in order to hysterically laugh. No one ever told me that the word “rich” rhymes with “wish”! Hahahaha. This poem should be used to teach the importance of using meter.GENERAL STUPIDITYI haven’t had the absolute privilege of writing one of these sections in a while! It’s like a homecoming. An unpleasant, unwanted homecoming. Like if my home was a festering swamp, or a city sewer system.Here’s one beautiful example - seriously, it’s like a gift from the reviewing gods: “Then she did her best to explain the truth about death and Caraval. Tella didn’t know the particulars as to how it worked. It was one of those things that people didn’t really talk about.” See what I mean?! Instead of the author coming up with an actual defined magic system, she just says “Oh, um...well the character doesn’t know. There’s that!” The world has no definition and neither does the magic. In other words, some of the sloppiest fantasy I’ve ever had the privilege to read.Plus, there’s a lot of weird stuff going on with hooking up with your family members’ sloppy seconds. I don’t want to talk about it because I’m grossed the f*ck out. I just want to let everyone know I’m SUPER not a fan.There’s also a fun moment where Scarlett lectures her sister on how “You can’t be in love with someone you just met,” even though a) she fell in luuurve with Julian in less than 5 days and b) she was planning on marrying someone she’d never met, and thought she could tell he was a good guy THROUGH LETTERS. So dumb.And then maybe my favorite moment of all: When a fortune teller tells Scarlett she wants “love and protection,” her reaction is even worse than I would have expected from a character I hate. She says, “Isn’t that what every girl wants?” WHAT. THE. DAMN. HELL. No! No, not every girl, you piece of shit! It’s fine to want that, but some girls want adventure and knowledge and friendship and bravery and the ability to look out for their damn selves! What the actual f*ck?!Bottom line: I can’t believe how much I hated this book. (Or how long this review is.) Boring setting, boring characters, boring plot. Overall confusing language and decisions and reveals. I honestly wish I had never read this book.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I feel the same way aboutCaravalas I did aboutThe Star-Touched Queenlast year. In fact, many of my comments are the same, so if you enjoyed that book then it\'s probable you will like this one also.Caravalis a fantasywithout world-building or significant character development. It relies on its dreamy descriptions,purple prose, and a heavy helping of romance to make it dazzle. To take a quote from my review ofThe Star-Touched Queen, ""if you buy into these metaphors, put on your prose-tinted glasses and let yourself get drunk on the glittering descriptions, I suppose you might be able to ignore..."" that\'s literally how I feel about this.It is about two sisters - Scarlett and Tella - who live on some random island in the middle of random world X with their abusive father who wants to marry Scarlett off to a count she\'s never met. Caraval is, as it sounds, a carnival-like game on another random island. People go there to play and if they win, they get a wish. The mysterious Caraval master is a guy called Legend, who Scarlett has been writing to for years, but he has now finally replied - and sent three tickets for Scarlett, Tella and Scarlett\'s fiance. Upon arrival at the island, Tella goes missing and it soon becomes apparent that finding her is all a part of the game. Scarlett must solve the clues and find her sister before Caraval is over.For one thing, this is a writing style that never appeals to me. So many metaphors and similes that I know are supposed to be evocative and exciting,but they\'re nonsensical. Phrases like this:“It smelled like the middle of the night”“He tasted like midnight and wind”“Tella’s expression fell, like a doll Scarlett had dropped.”I understand that some readers like this kind of mysterious, weird writing, but it just pulls me right out of the story. I\'m sat there thinking ""how the hell does something TASTE LIKE MIDNIGHT?"" What does it even mean that Tella\'s expression fell like a doll that Scarlett dropped? Does it mean that Tella is like a doll being dropped (i.e. unhappy doll?) or is the author equating the downwards turn of her expression with the downwards fall of a doll? Or neither - it just sounds good?And here, have some more:“Something about him made her feel perilous shades of silky black.”“The world tasted like lies and ashes when Scarlett woke.”“Something acidic and moldy and burnt bubbled up through Scarlett’s throat - the taste of death.”Let’s forget for a second that death now has a “taste” - is the author just listing random words that sound cool? Think about it. How can something taste acidic AND moldy AND burnt? I just don\'t believe that good writing is collecting as many exciting, descriptive words as possible and shoving them all together, regardless of whether they make any sense.But whatever. That\'s just taste for the writing style. I personally thought the story was lacking too, unless you are seekingmore romance and descriptions of male muscles than actual fantasy and mystery. From the very beginning, Scarlett goes on and on about the gorgeous men around her - Julian and Dante - often forgetting that her sister is missing because she is so caught up in her own romantic ambitions. And, of course, when Julian is seen talking with another girl, said girl is described as ""some tart in a bar""; in comparison to Scarlett who blushes every time Julian looks at her.He had the sort of profile meant for sculptors and painters. Full lips, strong jaw, coal-dark eyes sheltered by thick, dark brows.Do you think that she means ""sculptures"" and ""paintings"" instead? Or is it a stereotype I don\'t know about that artists are supposed to have a certain sort of profile? Anyway...I found so much of this book unsatisfying. I gave it an extra star because it remained interesting enough for me to read to the end, but there\'s not much more than a flowery romance contained within these pages. The mysteries and reveals are not particularly exciting, and there\'s a poorly-executed end moment where a character reveals everything through a long speech - like a magician dropping character at the end and telling the audience how they did it.Also, as a side note - and I wasn\'t sure if I was going to mention this or not - I got a very strong sense that I had read this story before. Most people probably won\'t know what I\'m talking about. But back when I was about eleven/twelve years old, I read a book calledThe Forbidden Gameby the same author who wroteVampire Diaries, about a girl who gets pulled into a game and must find her friends before the time is up. There\'s also a mysterious, gorgeous guy called Julian pulling the strings (holy shit, I was in love with him back then) and this book isso similar. Really. It makes me wonder if the author read it too.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Welcome, welcome to Caraval!

Her sister is missing and the dangers are mounting - will she be able to make it to her wedding?Will she be able to make it out alive?The main problem I had with this book is the decision-making skills, the ""magic"" and the general YA ness. Unfortunately, that overshadowed the book.The Decision-Making skills -aka we are always going for the worst option, aren\'t we?There\'s being sheltered...and then there\'s being extremely stupid.Scarlett Dragna falls under the latter.There were so many, many times I wanted to shake her - if there is choice between a dark, dank ominous cave vs a gentle sunlight path, she\'d be halfway down the cave-monster\'s gullet before I could blink.She just has a knack for that sort of thing.It probably doesn\'t help that despite repeated assurances that:What happens beyond this gate may frighten or excite you, but don’t let any of it trick you. We will try to convince you it’s real, but all of it is a performance. A world built of make-believe.Our lovely Scarlett believes everything -every single thing- that is said to her.The Magic -aka it\'s not SUPPOSED to be realistic, HahaI loved the idea of the Caraval - the ethereal magic, the enigma of the game and (of course) the trickery of Legend.But, the book fell short.The world-building needed to be significantly stronger. For a world that was purported as being one of intense magic and intrigue, everything was a bit meh and haphazard.The author used the excuse ""but it\'s magic""as a crutch sofreakingmuch.To explain: there\'s magic worlds out there that I believe 100%.Harry Potter, for example, was beautifully fleshed out. Yes, it was pure magic but it was also purely believable.I could instantly tell you what would and wouldn\'t make sense in this world.Caraval... not so much.The author has all thesewild crazy ideasand instead of building and connecting them... she just called it magic and that was it...For example, one of the bigger things in this novel was the clothing changes.A dress changes color, shape, form? And is the perfect size? How?Magic!... but... how? Is it a spell? Enchanted object? Mysterious ancient witchcraft?It\'s magic!No seriously. How do you have godlike seamstress powers?I SAID IT WAS MAGICOkay. So there\'s magic dresses. But how does that connect to the magic people? Mysterious sellers? Artifacts?Magic. *cocks gun*So... ultimately, the magic was used as a cool and trendy tool rather than a fleshed out aspect of the world.General YA-ness -aka this sounds familiarOf course, because this is YA romance, all the big kisses had to have oddly-specific descriptions:He tasted like midnight and wind, and shades of rich brown and light blue.And, even better:It tasted like the moment before night gives birth to morning.

I was intrigued by the summary from the second I found this was coming out, but had no clue if it would live up to the hype. The back cover boasts of“The spell-casting fantasy destined to become a sensation”and Fox 2000 has already purchased the rights to turn this into a major motion film, which claims some pretty mind-blowing story is within the covers. This book was even better than I could have imagined and then some.Hi, my name’s Chelsea and I’m addicted to Stephanie Garber’s world of Caraval.The blurb tells you everything you need to know going in; honestly, the less you know the better and the more confused you feel, the more enjoyable your reading experience will be. Every single chapter had some sort of twist, and whether it was minor or major, it got me. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. This book was somehow 400 pages, but it went by too quickly. I kept saying “Just one more chapter” and next thing you know, it was finished. Sort of. BecauseYAYbook #2 is coming! Well, once she writes it of course. (No pressure Steph. I’m only gnawing my nails to the bloody nub in anticipation.)Surprisingly, one of my favorite things about this book was the budding romance between Julian and Scarlett. I must be maturing (HAH!) and opening my reading door to some new things, because years ago this would have grossed me out to the core. The good news is it isn’t gross and cheesy; the tension continually grows throughout the book but it is really quite clean. This is something I wouldn’t bat an eye at letting my teenager read; the romance was tastefully done and, while refraining from being cheap and raunchy, sucked the reader in as the relationship grew. IMO, this showed what true talent the author had in being able to gain the reader’s interest in her romantic composition without relying on overdone sexual situations that are graphic and distracting from the heart of the story.JULIAN.I know Scarlett is supposed to the the show stopper here, but Julian stole the limelight for me. I fell in love with his character from the first page he showed up; he’s rugged, bold, and hilarious while carrying meaningful dialogue and playing a deeper role than just eye candy. I found myself cheering for him constantly throughout the story, and even when suspicion is cast his way multiple times (which both was rightly and wrongly cast), I couldn’t have cared less. This series I believe was set up, not as a complete focus on one character with many supporting roles, but as a character study on multiple people with a more complex story that interweaves multiple interests. While it is told mostly through Scarlett’s POV, we have a view into other’s interests as well, and the massive cliff hanger on the final page has set this up to be a strong series that should continue without a hitch.There is an overall dark feel to this book, and there is some disturbing violence in a fantasy-related sense, but it was necessary and intriguing to the story line. The mystery surrounding Legend and his traveling Caraval performers was breathtaking; I found myself completely lost in this otherworld. To me, it had a historical fiction feel with a side of science fiction due to the fantasy aspect, which made for a unique read. I’m not sure what else to add, other than I have an advanced case of Caraval hangover and need the book #2 cure ASAP. If you enjoy Young Adult novels, regardless of your age, you’ll want to open your heart and your book shelf up to this one. I hate writing reviews this far in advance for a book that doesn’t come out until next year, but go ahead an pre-order, make a note to yourself to request at your library in January, or go to NetGalley and request your copy, because it will have a guaranteed spot on my Top 10 Wrap Up at the end of the year.*I received my copy from the publisher.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""This freaking book HOLY CRAP.I have a feeling this book is going to be a huge hit when it comes out, and rightfully so.

It's been blowing up GR for quite a while now. People with ARC were selling it on eBay at ridiculously high prices. That's how it caught my attention in the first place. Was that a publicity stunt? If it was, it's not going to help much because the book is shitty. There is nothing new or exhilarating here. If anything, it's ideas stolen from a bunch of other books, The Lunar Chronicles, Hunger Games, Night Circus and such. There was no originality here whatsoever, on top of all that IT'S BORING AF!The only characters who held my attention were Iko(TLC much?)and Dante. Obviously, if you are interesting, you aren't good enough for this book. They are no one of relevance. :/Let's talk about Scarlet, our main character. I really tried to like just because of that name of hers. Scar from Lunar Chronicles is my absolute favorite! Unfortunately, similarities don't go any further than their name. This Scarlet is one of those characters who we are constantlytoldis clever, adventurous, and ambitious. Let me tell you right now, she is none of those things. Scarlet is gutless and way too naive for my taste. I'm sorry, but i didn't find her to be very intelligent either. Many times i was baffled by her ignorance. These riddles weren't even hard to crack, but it took Miss Scarlet pages and pages crying over totally random and irrelevant things till correct answers would slap her right in the face. THEN things would click in her tiny brain.Legend is the Darkling figuremore like an insult to Darkling's greatness. He is the mysterious host of Caraval. He is dangerous. He is crazy. He is the villain. No one has ever met him, nor do they have any idea what he looks like. He wears a new face every year. And he sees everything. In other words, BLAH BLAH BLAH. At first, i was aboard. I was totally anticipating meeting this Leged. However, at one point his name started irritating me because it's all just talk. He isn't even in the book!Julian is a young sailor who helped Scarlet and her sister escaped their evil father. He gave me massive Captain Carswell Thorne vibes. Of course, me being trash for TLC didn't need anything more. When i started looking at Julian as his own character, not Carswell wannabethat's pretty much what he washis character is flat/painfully predictable. Didn't buy the romance for a second. It was merely anticlimactic.This being said, please don't let me discourage you from reading this. What do I know, I am just a crazy woman who is super picky when it comes to fiction. It's just my, once again, unpopular opinion. UGH, i told you didn't out it there for decoration.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""*Full Review Update!!* (Spoiler free)I cannot rave enough guys... this book wins everything.This has made it in to myabsolute all time favorites. I can't even function normally to describe it... I am absolutely floored. Zero complaints. I enjoyed every sentence.. every page.I couldn't get enough. It was whimsical, off the charts electric, romantic, mysterious, enchanting, enthralling... full of twists and turns. So many that I thought the ending couldn't possibly live up to the mystery this created.. but it absolutely did.My advice is to go into this knowing NOTHING. Seriously, I wanted to throw like 10 billion quotes in my review because I loved it THAT MUCH but its going to be so much more mysterious if you just dive right in. But I'll say this - I was hooked from the first page. There's a series of letters that Scarlett writes to the 'Caraval master' Legend over a series of years. This story begins when he finally writes back.I loved the writing and the pacing so so much. It wasn't too slow but it wasn't too fast either - it was just right for the character development. Scarlett was the perfect choice for an MC and I loved being in her mind without any outside perspective. Everything about the plot and the other characters are a complete mystery. Good luck trying to guess everything... you'll need it. The best part of the experience for me personally was trying to guess who was who and who was good/bad.I literally cannot comment on any of the other characters because it would be a spoiler - but oh man.. you guys. I think I'm in love.And the end? CLEVER. Wow. I LOVED IT SO MUCH. I thought Stephanie was writing herself into a hole with all the mystery but boy oh boy did she deliver.The setting is another win for this book. If you like the Night Circus, you'll be pleased. (The plot is totally different but the magical circus/carnival like atmosphere is on point.)Alright, I know I've done nothing but hyped up this book. Do yourself a favor though- go in with zero expectation, spoilers, hints, etc. Just enjoy the ride.Now excuse me while I go work on fan art because this has taken over my world.My Blog~Instagram~Twitter~Etsy""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""—— 3.75✰ stars.“Whatever you've heard about Caraval, it doesn't compare to the reality.

I wanted to smack Scarlett about 15 times during the book because she said this one thing about 50 billion times.I have to get back to get married. I have to get back to get married. I have to get back to get married. I have to get back to get married. I have to get back to get married. <-- Okay those are not the EXACT words but still - ya get me?But I digress =)The sexual tension between Scarlett and Julian could melt butter! And gave me some twinges at times. Good twinges!I guess I should just crack on with the book =)Soooooooooooo, Scarlett and Donatell (Tella) have a jerk face for a father and they are stuck on an island with him. He will do horrible things to them or other people if they dare try to escape. But Scarlett has a way out, she is to marry some dude her father set her up with and take her sister, Tella, with her. Scarlett has never met this man and her father won't tell her anything about him. Like that's not sketchy.When Scarlett was younger she used to write letters to Master Legend for years trying to get him to come to their island with his Caraval. Of course he never comes but one day many moons later he sends a letter to Scarlett inviting her and Tella and a guest to his Caraval on an island down on the right.Scarlett is so happy but she knows she won't be able to go because she will be getting married soon but Tella gets her to go. It's an unsavory way but Scarlett, Tella and Julian (whom Tella met while he was visiting their island) all end up at Caraval. And it's crayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy! Things and people are not what they seem.And they say that Legend creeps around watching people. You also have the choice of watching the show or participating in the show to get a special wish at the end if you are the winner. But the show can drive you mad.Turns out Tella is put into the show and everyone in the show must find her or she could die! What?

It's more than just a game or a performance. It's the closest you'll ever find to magic in this world.❞Thank you to Flatiron Books for sending me an advance reading copy of Caraval for review purposes.4.5 STARSThis book was just absolutely ENCHANTING! I didn't know how high or how low to set my expectations before going into Caraval but one thing is for sure by the time I closed this book: Caraval surpassed all my expectations and more. I've always been a sucker for circus/carnival themed books but I never read another book that came close to one of my favorite circus tales and favorite books of all time, The Night Circus. But Caraval has easily set its place right next to The Night Circus as one of the most magical stories I have ever read.From the very first page up until the last, there was never a dull moment while reading Caraval. It was just an enigma wrapped in magic and deception. One minute you think you have the story and the characters all figured out, the next minute the storyline takes you on a completely different direction! There were just so many twists, turns, and puzzles that every page leaves you hanging at the edge of your seat.Although Caraval didn't really feel like it took place in a circus/carnival like I was hoping it would, the world building was still very mystical. Clues and objects are paid in your deepest secrets, greatest fear, or even days of your life. There are tunnels that drive you mad and make you question what is real and what is simply part of the game. Caraval was just full of so many surprises that'll keep you turning the page. I had so many theories right from the very beginning that kept changing and evolving as the story progressed. I was so immersed in trying to crack the big mystery that was Caraval and Legend. Remember that it's just a game. But is it really? ;) This book will definitely leave you with more questions than answers in the end so prepare to be mind blown!I can't even put into proper words how magical this book truly is. Of course I can't speak for everybody, but I can almost guarantee that you'll never read a story like Caraval! Stephanie Garber has made quite the entrance into this community with this captivating piece of work. I almost can't believe that Caraval is actually her first book! I can see so much potential in this author and in this world that she has created. I definitely can't wait for book two because something tells me that Stephanie has more tricks and magic up her sleeve for her readers! :)*** The quote in this review was taken from an uncorrected proof and should be compared to the final copy upon release.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""˚. ✶ ⋆ ᭡4.25 stars–spoilers are marked╰ ✧ ׁ݂ “welcome, welcome to caraval!”.˳˖overall thoughts:₊‧well i actually lowered my rating because i didn't think the book was that good but 4.25 is still great! i'm absolutely in love with the world and was so heavily immersed in it, it made me love the fantasy genre even more and realise how much i missed it <33 and when i was reading it i really wanted to read legendary after it because it was so good!! absolutely adored how magical this was!╰ ✧ ׁ݂ “when his soft lips touched her skin the entire world shattered into a million shards of colored glass.”.˳˖characters:₊‧scarlett: she was my favourite character and was very different from donatella. she knew how to take care of things and did usually handle the matter presented to her.donatella: to be honest, i found her character to be more impulsive and stuff, unlike her sister.julian: he was actually so cute""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '2.5 stars. I unfortunately was not a big fan of Caraval, which is very disappointing to me considering I was really excited for it!Pretty much, everything about this book fell short for me. Every character was bland and annoying with no personality. The romance had absolutely no substance in my opinion, I never felt any chemistry or understood why they got together other than the fact that they were basically one of the only people available to the other. The setting of Caraval was so much less magical and whimsical than I anticipated, and even the darker portions of the performance weren\'t dark enough! The tagline is ""It\'s all an elaborate performance,"" but it felt nothing like a performance at all. It felt like one big, wishy-washy scavenger hunt, not the *amazing, adventurous* experience we\'re lead to believe.The magic system itself really irked me. It felt like a bad case of ""This happens because !*~.- m A g I c -.~*!"" with very little explanation as to how the magic works. I don\'t feel there were many limitations, and the restrictions that were present weren\'t all that clear. The magic system was severely underdeveloped in my opinion, which is a big issue for me as a reader.There definitely were points where I was more interested and entertained by the story (thought those only occurred when I could block out at least a 3 hour uninterrupted period, which is not typical for my audiobook listening) but overall, it was a tough book to get through. I don\'t often consider putting books down, but there were times when I questioned why I was still listening and contemplated not finishing it.Ultimately, this book felt very juvenile for me (that is not to say books intended for younger readers are not as good!) but I tend to enjoy more mature YA novels. That being said, I can see why there is so much hype for this book, especially within readers younger than myself. I think younger Emma MIGHT have enjoyed it more, considering I don\'t look at books the same way I did at 17.I\'m not sure if I\'d read book two, I\'d have to see how I feel about this story around the time it comes out. But considering I felt Caraval would have fared better as a standalone, it just doesn\'t seem like this series is for me.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is my second time reading this as I was lucky enough to receive an ARC of the audiobook from Macmillan audio (thank you so much to them!)

THE JUMP SCARES WERE SCARING“Whatever you've heard about Caraval, it doesn't compare to the reality. It's more than just a game or performance. It's the closest you'll ever find yourself magic in this world.”Scarlett Dragna grew up hearing stories from her grandmother Annalise about Caraval and ever since her dream was attending Caraval a magical game that promises an adventure of a life time in which you can either choose to watch or play but this isn’t open to just anyone it’s exclusive and one can only obtain entry via a ticket. Every year she’d write to the Caraval master Legend (that’s what’s he’s called in the book I know kind of confusing 😂 ) in hopes of attending but as years went on her hope was also lost until one day she received a reply which included 3 tickets one for her, her sister Donatella and her soon going to be fiancé the count who she is arranged to marry by her father. There was just one problem their father a ruthless man who’d never let her and her sister off the island but a sailor Julian promises the girls he’d help them off the island and attend Caraval would the girls be able to truly escape their father and enter this magical world or would he catch up before they got a chanceScarelett Dragna ( AKA Crimson )“For years her father tore her down. Over and over, she had let him. She’d allowed him to make her feel worthless and powerless. But she was neither of those things. She was done allowing her fear to make her weaker”I can’t lie at the start she really irritated me because all she cared about was her sister it’s like she had no Personality. HOW CAN I NOT FAIL TO MENTION SHE WAS READY TO MARRY THE COUNT A MAN SHED NEVER MET BECAUSE HER FATHER SAID SO LIKE GIRL IF HE WAS A GOOD MAN WHY WOULD YOUR FATHER HIDE HIS NAME FROM YOU💀😭. However as the book developed so did Scarlett’s personality we got to see her love and think about someone other than her sister for once.Donatella Dragna ( AKA Tella )“I meant it when I said I’d rather die at the edge of the world than live a miserable life on Trisda.”At first I thought she was a selfish bitch who only cared about her self but it turns she was also looking out for her sister. Unlike Scarlett tella had a personality she’d rather die than not be able to live and experience life to the fullest I can’t lie sometimes she took things way too extreme and annoyed the living day lights out me but my girl was smart smart IF YOU KNOW YOU KNOW SHE BROKE THE RULE OF ONLY ELDER SISTERs PROTECT WHICH MADE ME LOVE HER BECAUSE SHE WOULD LITERALLY DIE FOR SCAR💕💕💕Julian ( The sailor )“He’d never stared at her like this before. Sometimes he gazed at her as if he wanted to be her undoing, but just then it was as if he wanted her to undo him”🥲🥹So my dumb ass thought he was a side character at first just a normal guy trying to help two girls off an island but boy was I wrong.

That’s all I have to sayThe count“That’s funny,” the gentleman said. “All this time, I thought she was my fiancée.”He was just a creep whyyyy the hell are you trying to marry a girl who loves someone else LIKE YOU LEFT YOUR SELF RESPECT OUT THE DOOR not to mention he bought Scarlett like ewww someone has no rizzJulian and Scarlett“Crimson, don’t do this for me.” Julian shot a pleading look toward Scarlett. “You can’t give yourself to him. I don’t care about what happens to me.“Julian,” she said in a whisper, as if anything louder would destroy the delicacy of the moment, “why are you doing this?”His amber-flecked eyes met hers, and something in them made her breathing hitch. “I’d think that answer was obvious.”😫😍😍These two have my heart and I don’t want it back.

Colors that made her feel safe and guarded.”julian:in page 58 i heard the nickname’crimson’and i fell for him in that second. nicknames are usually cute but a word that is special to fmc and describes something about her personality? that should be considered as a love language type. the best thing about him was he was never supposed to stay with scarlett, hewantedto. he was by her side in every step, he guided her, protected her, sacrificed himself for her.his descriptions were so passionate, his personality was presented asa cold breeze, a twisted smirk and explicit lies,and his eyes werecaramel and the color of light brown, liquid form of amber, the color of passion.the way he mouthed’my little liar’to scarlett.. giggling. too much.the rest has spoilers, so if you haven’t read it, i would advice not checking this place; thank you for sticking up till here!💗since he was forbid to show his identity as a performer, he tried to show his true feelings by trying make scarlett happy and safe. he fought for earrings. he gave a day from his life. hediedfor her. is there anything more that he could ever done..he understood how much of a guilt scarlett had over their father beating tella for her mistakes, and always tried to make her understood that it was never her fault. he made scarlett realize that there are more things than being safe and guarded, such as following her heart and sticking with julian.“She remembered thinking falling for him would be like falling in love with darkness, but now she imagined he was more like a starry night: the constellations were always there, constant, magnificent guides against the ever-present black.”scarjulian:they complement each other so well; scarlett’s calmness and sweetness combined with julian’s adventurous and flirty personality is so amazing. the way they both sacrifice themselves for each other, counting on the other for every situation and working as a team and slowly falling for each other was such a beautiful journey to read.“She’d disappeared like a broken star, leaving the world untouched, save for the bits of missing light that no one would ever see again.”tella:i tried to love her, i really did. i can understand why she did the things she has done but her method was.. brutal? scarlett might have forgiven her for the anxiety she has put her through, but i can’t. scarlett felt overwhelmed and hopeless for five days, died a day, watched her lover and her sister die at the same day and many things more.. i really cannot overcome from this just in one chapter, i just hope that she will redeem herself in legendary.“As a girl, Scarlett had been drawn to the idea of Legend’s magic. But Tella always wanted to hear about the master of Caraval’s darker side. A part of Scarlett couldn’t deny there was something seductive about winning the heart of someone who’d vowed to never love again.”this quote is the point where i got even more excited for the second book. i’m not gonna lie, i love scarlett much more than i do tella, however the plot of her book seems a lot more interesting to me. i really hope that she can get more mature so i can enjoy the book much more!“Do you always focus on what you're giving up, rather than what you'll be gaining? Some things are worth pursuit regardless of the cost.”another thing i like to mention is that the meaning and lessons behind caraval. since this was the first book, we haven’t got much information about the history and reasons behind the game, however the messages it gave was so wise and beautiful. it some kind of gave you the life lessons you needed by challenging you, and making you wonder around the boundaries of madness at the same time.“I think I've made a mistake.''Then make it into something better.”last but definitely not least, i need to thank my sweet angelbruna.i know i liked the book more than you did, however i know that two days ago was another perfect evening/night for us. you are one of the rare reasons that i love so much that i can stay up till 3am, and not wanting to go to sleep. this book’s magic level is undeniable, however if there is something more magical, it is definitely you. i love you my beautiful girl, thank you for being my side at the every stage of this book. 💌oct 29:well i have 61 tabs, and i am so confused! 🙈 but i loved it sm heheh, sortc!oct 26:i’ve suffered too much because of romance books, so i’m going back to my roots, reading fantasy 🫂 and i am draggingbruwith me 🩷""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'So that was...boring.I went in with low expectations because of the mixed reviews I had been seeing on my feed but I guess it was another case of ""It\'s not you, it\'s me."" Maybe I could\'ve liked it if I read it in my teens but it was so YA, guess that\'s another reason why it didn\'t work for me.I liked the start, it was intriguing but 70 pages in and it already was boring me. Theplotfelt messy to me, although the writing is quite decent.One thing I really dislikedwas the sisters relationship with each other. There was no unity, no sense of sisterhood. Tella is so deceiving and Scarlett is so thickheaded. They both talk of loving and protecting each other but the amount of secrets they keep, the lying, was itreallllyyyyrequired? I failed to see that so called sisterly love.Tellaannoyed me. She was conniving, deceptive and just too much for me.Scarlettaka Crimson, was a typical damsel in distress and that\'s what she stayed like even at the end. She has no fire power and both of the sisters are quite forgettable. Scarlett, especially is so dumb 😭 I did not see any character growth for both of them.Julianwas interesting. He grew on me at the end and now that I think about it, he was the only reason why I kept reading instead of skimming.Some of the plot twists were really good. Legend definitely is intriguing.

So here it goes 🤞'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '3.8'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""Our futures are only predictable because as creatures of this world we are predictable.I really did want to like this book.I really did want to dive into a magical and dark adventure with Scarlett and Tella.Sadly for me, I didn’t enjoy it the way I thought I would, and this adventure turned out to be a little school trip to Boredom Land, with one heck of a frustrating main character.And don’t even let me start on her sister.The premise is good, though it has its little flaws right from the start.The writing, for one, has a dull and chanting rhythm. There are a few nice quotes here and there, but nothing remarkable. Dialogues andattemptedbantering included.Gosh, those dialogues. *shivers* I’ll have nightmare for days.The characters are infuriatingly undefined.Their personalities and traits are smudgy on their borders. They all read the same way, they all look and talk the same, and they lack of substance, insomuch that, still now, I can’t understand what the deal was with a lot of them.Scarlett is not that bad, but if I had to tip the scale in favor of a concrete judgment, I’d say she’s an easily forgettable character.Sometimes I found myself wanting to jump into the book, grab her by her shoulders and give her a vigorous shake because, holy crow, her obliviousness got on my nerves more times than I can count.She’s really insecure and timorous, yet patsy and judgy to the point of aversion.To an extent, I see how her father’s abuse has a part in all of this. Yet, as someone who’s supposed to be the tough and motherly sister, I feel like she’s way too immature and naïve, too ready to give away her feelings to those who don’t deserve it.Still, I’m not holding any of this against her, because poor Scarlett is basically an unconsciously willing victim of circumstance.Tella, on the other hand…She's so flipping selfish and dumb. I really hope Scarlett will grow some balls and tell her off. Oh, scratch that, just give her a well deserved noogie.Julian, Mr Love Interest, could not be there and I wouldn’t notice, or wouldn’t care. I probably would have liked him more if he wasn’t always trying so hard. His purposes and aims are so conventionally confined into the “typical mysterious good-looking guy” category, and his flirting is so bland that you can’t even go past the fact that he’s just another pretty face in another unpretty book.I’m not even gonna waste my words on Legend and all the *sarcastic air quotes* mystery that surrounds him. Fuck you, you old fart. Give me my money back.Luckily enough, the plot is probably the thing I liked the most, even if I probably hyped this book too much in my own head to the point it took me exactly 270 pages to feel the reader’s high.The setting is gorgeous, I got to give it to the author. Had she wrote about flowers and dresses and a whole another kind of circus-like place (one where, supposedly, Scarlett is a badass and Tella is participating in an Erasmus program in Grunland), I would have fallen hard for it.I wish she’d focused more on describing the surroundings, giving more space and a proper background story to more secondary characters, instead of going on, pages and pages, about feelings and stuff.However, I loved the way everything merges together and gives the story, its performers and the entirety of Caraval, this Venetian, carnivalesque freak-show kind of halo.Alas, things started to get interesting when I was already too far into the book and already too oriented towards a negative outcome, so I probably didn’t even enjoy it as much as I could have.I kind of was expecting that ending, to be honest.It’s the kind of book that requires something shocking, that leaves people with their mouth and eyes wide open buuuut...nope, I'm not impressed at all.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '2.75 stars❛ My little liar, Julian mouthed.❜The writing held a contradictory connotation, to my opinion.It rocked from a polished, opulent vocabulary and exquisite metaphors to an atrociously neglected characters’ depth and world building. Some scenes were vividly and graphically descriptive from the costumes to the atmosphere surrounding our protagonists but they lacked explanation when it came to Scarlett’s feelings and thoughts,she partially felt shallowexcept from some verbal jousts with Julian. Plus,the magic orbiting aroundThe Caraval, Legendand theactorswas nonchalantly mentioned. Perhaps it was intentional and some of the questions will be answered and clarified in the next books in the series but, for me, the way the folklore wasn’t sufficiently distilled through the chapters to offer a perfect understanding of the magical world made it difficult to go through the story, therefore I didn’t feel completely connected to either the storyline nor the characters.""Legend’s special guest had made Scarlett feel privileged. For the first time in her life, she’d felt special. Chosen. But once again, rather than feeling as if she were playing the game, it seemed as if the game were playing with her.""Everything was a subterfuge.A game, from the side characters’ intentions and motives to why the story started in the first place.When you feel like a guest you are in reality just a piece of chess in the grand scheme of The Caraval. And I got played all along with Scarlett. I was angry at first but, I completely understand the author’s vision, it’s honestly brilliant from the start to near,nearthe end . However, it was poorly, barely sorted. The ending felt rushed and Scarlett made some compromises and decisions that I don’t understand, at all.P.S.:Julian carried the book until he didn’t.🫶🏼~•~•~•~•~tella WTH girl?????? the last chapters? im speechless. rtc~*~*~*~*~*~monique is joining the julian fan club, hope yall r happy now!idk who the hell he isbuddy read withlilaandAliki🫶🏼'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""This book was ass but surprisingly I really enjoyed it. 😔 review to come——listen....

I also felt an inexplicable need to share a few sentences on why I loved this book, so here we go!THE WRITING Fairytale books (books written in that style) turn into fairytale attempts usually by page 3-4. But this WHOLE BOOK is a giant fairytale from start to finish. It's hard to keep the vibes going, but Stephanie Garber managed to do just that. I know that these books are very popular, and just that usually gives books a bad rep. Why, it's simple, it's either that so many people are trying to shove the book down your throath or they don't market it very well. Let me tell you, I've seen countless drawings of the characters, quotes, beautiful covers and special editions, but not a single soul told me HOW WELL THIS WAS WRITTEN. I'm a huge sucker for a good writing style, and the way a book is worded heavily affects my rating! I read this on my Kindle so I didn't tab anything and there wasn't much that was quote-worthy, but just like I noticed with Divine Rivals, every single sentence was thought through, well phrased, comparisons were beautiful. The writing gave the whole book a mystical magical aesthetic. I wouldn't really say that typical fairytale phrases were present (or I haven't noticed them), but the VIBE was there (and I'm all about vibes).THE PLOT just kept going. Since this book came out in 2016 (THAT'S CRAZY), tell me, what would you expect? Personally, I would expect three things: 1. a teenage girl who needs to save the world 2. a love triangle 3. our FMC falling in love with an evil mastermind. NO, NO AND NO! This book was none of that! It was twisty, it was unpredictable, the plot shifted every 2 pages, I was going insane in the updates (I'm sorry for my terrible theories guys). There were so many plot points and I DIDN'T GUESS A SINGLE ONE CORRECTLY! It looks like I love to be a fool since I loved this book!THE ROMANCE was present here and there, we did admire all these hot men Scarlett stumbled upon (even though we never really knew their true identities). But they were all dark-haired, SO DON'T BLAME ME IF I FOLDED. The romance aspect of this also wasn't very prominent and it didn't drive the plot that much. So, that part was short and sweet, it was done right, and I can't complain!THE CHARACTERS Breaking my silence, I found all of them annoying in the beginning (Scarlett, Tella, Julian). They were very typical-insufferable-YA-lead coded those first 50 pages, but then BOOM, I fell in love with all of them and rooted for their happy ending! I wouldn't say that Stephanie Garber put an emphasis on her characters, like I said, this book was very prominently plot-driven and that's something that surprised me. I'm usually a fan of character-driven stories and those tend to be my favorites (or highly rated books), so, if I find the characters not character-ing, or let's say, lacking, the book doesn't get a high rating from me. I still wish we got more juice-of-your-soul typa content from our protagonists, but they were running around through the entirety of this book, so not much time for trauma dumping, I guess.THE WARDROBE I've recently seen a video talking about how readers don't really care what a character is wearing and it was basically a plea to authors not to include thorough physical descriptions of characters and I pretty much agreed with the creator of that video at the time. This book has done that, and tbh, overdone it, BUT IT WAS JUST WHAT I NEEDED. I ate up every single description of every single outfit these circus lunatics were wearing, STEPHANIE YOU'RE A GENIUS (i wanna go to fashion school).That's it for this review, I'm ready for this author to ruin me forever! 💖💖""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""This wasHIGHLYentertaining!!! I was betrayed once then twice, then lost count from that moment cuz I was embarrassed I couldn't get it right anytime lmao!definitely looking forward to reading the rest of the series!3.75 or 4ish stars!🌟----------------------Pre-readit's my turn to start this journey !!🥲""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'I cannot even express to you guys how bland this book was: like tofu, like unseasoned chicken breast, like brown bread with no peanut butter. Just miss me with that shit. Miss me with it all the way.Back in the day, when I was a snarky teenager, I used to enjoy writing reviews that were really, really, venomous. Kids can be cruel, and while I stand by my right to love or hate any media, and to express my opinion, it can go...a little far. Then again, hyperbole is hyperbole. When, at seventeen, I went around saying that a book was so bad it gave me measles, you might want to take that with a pinch of salt, and also for its obvious comedic value. People are more than welcome to get irate about my reviews - they often do, bless them - but at the end of the day, books are books, a form of entertainment. It\'s not life or fucking death, guys. I don\'t think a cheeky sarcastic review is going to stop any author from paying their bills and nor is it going to bar anyone else from enjoying the book.These days, I\'m still not one to hold back, but one woman\'s trash is another\'s treasure. Everybody likes things for different reasons. It\'s also a testament to how my writing has improved that I no longer write critiques like an angry goth whose elders don\'t ""get her vibe"". I like to think that I write now with the same energy and aesthetic as a French person saying ""bof"" if you ask them how their meal was at the Hard Rock Cafe.I\'m saying this because as a teenager, before the Terrible Twenties swept over my home like a harbinger of end times, a wicked power that even the lamb\'s blood smeared over the threshold of my door could not ward off, I would have torn this book a new one. But now, all I can do is look at it, sigh, and say, ""Well, at least that\'s over.""Okay, listen. I have read worse books. But I don\'t think that\'s a compliment, is it? This was just so tired, so expected, so flat. The last twenty percent of this was completely unintelligible, and maybe I could have forgiven it this- all of this nonsense with people coming back to life and a stupidly elaborate plan just to get Tella and Scarlett away from their father when they could have just stabbed him in his sleep, all of the bullshit that everyone put Scarlett through that she fucking forgave them for, and the fact that this whole thing was just one big humiliating runaround for Scarlett that accomplished absolutely nothing since their father still knows Scarlett is alive and could still come after her -if the characters had not been unbearably flat. It was so difficult to care about anything because the essential emotional thread of the story just didn\'t exist.Julian is a horrible fucking liar, Tella is a manipulative arsehole, and Scarlett is so painfully gullible, and you might think that this could make them interesting, but it doesn\'t - they\'re all painted in such a positive light, everything they do justified, and I would have preferred a cast full of villains to this.And on paper, you might think it\'s clever and exciting that it all turns out to be an elaborate game, but the whole thing is so shoddily cobbled together, so nonsensical, that it just feels like reaching. This whole book is just reaching, basically.Frankly, this book reads like an early draft that need a lot of polishing. It\'s all over the place, and I can\'t invest myself in that sort of story, where I can feel every move the author was making. It\'s so difficult to get on board with a book that\'s written that way. Because youcanfeel every move the author made, or rather, every misstep. It feels rushed and messy, lazily plotted, poorly paced.But these are serious, fundamental problems with the story structure itself. The whole premise is a problem, because it just doesn\'t make any sense why any of this is happening, and it makes even less sense the further you go. It is actually shocking to me how shoddy it is.Take it back to the drawing board; invest some more time in it. The very bare bones of this story could potentially be interesting, and I do like the idea of the circus (kind of. Not really. I\'m just trying to be nice here). With a few massive rounds of editing it could have been something cool. But as it is, it\'s sort of a wreck. The kicker with the prose is that I see what the author was trying to do: magical writing for a story about magic. But there is no magic here. And it wouldn\'t matter what sort of book this was, what the story was about, because writing like this never works. This book is badly written and there is nothing else I can say about this, except to deliver some examples, because it has to be seen to be believed.""Every touch created colors she had never seen. Colors as soft as velvet and as sharp as sparks that turned into stars.""what""Tella loved danger the same way candlewicks loved to burn.""the""She remembered his rows of sharply defined brown muscles.""actual""Fierce as a kitten who\'d just gotten claws, willing to shred the whole world to make this right.""fuck""Shades of the rich ruby love she\'d felt during the game mixed with hues of deep-indigo hurt, turning everything just a little bit violet.""is""Scarlett wanted to melt into the night, wink out of existence like a broken star.""this""Tella beamed, brighter than candlelight and glass-cut glitter""???That\'s a good question, isn\'t it? I\'ll leave you to ponder it.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'I had really high hopes forCaraval. The blurb, the cover, and the excellent reviews promised a magical whirlwind of a story. And this novel delivered that, but its relatively achieved grandeur was overshadowed bit by bit till the end. The last 50 pages or so of the book took its soul out, leaving me with a bittersweet aftertaste, a headache and lots of confusion.Since I cannot even reflect upon the messy thoughts inside my brain, I\'ll analyze punctually.1. The world-building.Sadly, in its true meaning and ramifications, we have no such thing as world-building. I do not even know how to categorize this novel. High-fantasy? Just fantasy? Regardless, in the beginning we had mentions of empires and conquered isles which had me utterly excited, but they were left to rot in the backseat so that the world of Caraval could unravel. Moving to this microcosm, it was indeed complex and fascinating. However, only through its captivating appearance and bold imagery and creative ideas. If you dive deeper, into the background, mechanisms and history, you come up empty. It\'s all really a facade.2. The plot.God, the lies. There were so many lies and so many secrets and so many games and manipulation that it honestly ended up being exhausting. Revelations upon revelations, ones that often contradict each other, keep you guessing from start to finish, but after a while this initially mesmerizing stance metamorphoses into the feel of being tricked. Personally, that\'s how I felt. Deceived. After all the puzzle pieces finally straightforwardly fell into place (some that I\'ve anticipated, some that I did not) you are offered an explanation. And like all good magic tricks, this kills the spirit -- and, implicitly, the so called ""plot"" -- of Caraval. Gone is the magic and wonder; instead, the triviality and over-the-top drama take residence. It\'s a scam. A ploy. And, much like Scarlett felt in last key-scenes, I also felt I haven\'t really made progress in the story.3. The characters.We have Scarlett, our heroine; Julian, the love-interest; Donatella, the sister. Governor Dragna, the father and also the villain. Legend, the pseudo villain and the mastermind behind Caraval. Plus a few secondary, yet admirable characters (them I liked in their entirety). Scarlett could have been awesome, I\'m telling you, if it weren\'t for her constant fretting and worrying and flowery thinking. Her personality was nuanced only in the kind, moral and brave spectrum, but at least a fraction of character development existed. Julian is a completely other story. The hottie and protective type, he was so intricately woven into the scam I\'ve mentioned that he missed becoming a swoony book boyfriend. Tella was, on the other hand, funky and with a mind of her own, but her supposed cleverness the author tries to sell us falls flat. Despite their flaws, the sisters had a nice relationship. Their father represents a villain-wannabe that should only be called as he truly is -- an abuser, a bully. Legend... now Legend was a mystery and I\'d love to find out more. The epilogue seems to hint we\'ll see him again in a sharper focus.4. The romance.A bit too syrupy and insta-love reminiscing. I realize now it\'s the same feeling I\'ve had when readingFalling Kingdoms: it\'s too much, too early in too little pages. About a quarter into the book, the feelings developed by Scarlett for Julian were already getting in the way of the plot. And I am quite the romantic fan girl, so when I\'m saying something felt off, I\'m not doing it lightly. Taking into account the amount of untruths that they based their relationship on, it\'s yet again a case of a shaky foundation to a central aspect of the book.5. The writing style.Expect prose the likes of Laini Taylor. It sounds beautiful and I\'ll admit I get swept away pretty easily with this type of writing. It felt like the story flowed, despite its numerous hiccups. The third-person narrative also helped induce a darker atmosphere to keep us on the edge. On a structural level, there was redundancy, but I managed to overlook it gradually. Overall, I\'ll keep an eye out for Stephanie Garber, because this debut certifies she has storytelling skills.Even thoughCaravalhas been pitched asThe Night Circusin different and refreshing clothing, it is far from the lovely and slow-burning tale of Celia and Marco. Nonetheless, I wholeheartedly believe it deserves at least a skimming. It\'s an enigmatic story from start to finish and the epilogue assured I\'ll read the sequel. Color me intrigued.ENJOY! <3'}]"

(Update: I no longer love The Hating Game. But let's pretend for the sake of me not having to update this review that I do._Here is a statement about this book I believe to be true:1) It is just a worse The Hating Game.To be fair, most Christina Lauren books are just a worse The Hating Game. (In my opinion, that is. Because for reasons unknown I love The Hating Game.)I mean. Here, we have Olive, the adorkable, cringey heroine who Doesn’t Know She Is Beautiful But Does Know She Is Physically Sexy (because that’s definitely different from a woman being valued only for sexual purposes). She’s paired with Ethan, the cold and mean (but so hot and omg his ABS) guy who is actually sooooo nice once you get to know him and all those times he was a total asshole? Just a misunderstanding. Well I mean it staaaarted a misunderstanding, but then the girl was like, so mean to him (and also so sexy, he was distracted by her boobs / butt / legs can you blame him), so then he just HAD to be a mean vengeful child about it for literally years on end!Essentially The Hating Game.And I have to tell you, I’m getting realllllll sick of this trope. It’s just childish bickering teeming with misunderstandings then sexy time then a major misunderstanding then make-up sexy time and finally, mercifully, The End.I like The Hating Game, though, because it’s charming and I found the romance believable. Not only was I not charmed by this book, not only did I not find the romance believable, but...well.Let’s do a list.1) The Huge Misunderstanding That Threatens To Ruin Everything Even True Love is very, very stupid. Putting this point in spoiler tags:Our protagonist, Olive, has a twin, Ami, who is married to Ethan’s brother, whose name I couldn’t remember if you paid me. I had to look up everyone else’s names in the synopsis. Anyway, Ethan’s brother - let’s call him Stupid Jock With No Traits Who Doesn’t Matter, Jock for short - comes onto Olive in a super creepy way, and when she tells Ami and Ethan about it, they both accuse her of lying. In spite of the fact that, supposedly, they both love her in respective once-in-a-lifetime level bonds. There is literally no reason for them to think she’s lying and to believe Jock, who is sh*tty and gross, but they do. Because drama.2) There’s such a halfhearted subplot for Olive about her needing a DREAM CAREER. One of the first things we learn about her (after the first round of the countless descriptions of her sexy curvy body) is that she genuinely enjoys her career path and is good at it. But for some reason...that is not a dream career? Am I an emotionless robot for not understanding that? The rest of the book is teeming with Motivational Passages from Ethan and Olive’s internal monologue about her Not Settling and Finding Herself and I just...don’t get it.3) The way the world works in this book feels completely unfamiliar to me. Like, Olive’s twin Ami pays for her entire wedding - venue, food, dress, hotel, honeymoon, everything - with...coupons? What? That’s not a thing. Olive gets fired for a reason solely related to her personal life, which makes no sense. Everyone believes there’s such a thing as a definitively good or bad luck? What. Where are we. What’s going on.But worst of all...I didn’t care about this at all. Where was the CHEMISTRY. Where was the CHARM. Where was the part where I FALL in LOVE and also they FALL in LOVE.Why am I reading a rom-com and feeling neither ROM nor COM.Bottom line: Will I keep reading Christina Lauren books? Who’s to say.

And they are both - I\'m quoting here - boob men (curious - does this boob thing come up in all their books?).Boob joking aside, Olive and Ethan could just as easily be Josh and Hazel. They read like the same couple. Also, I see a lot of reviewers talking about this promised ""enemies-to-lovers"" romance, but I\'m just not that convinced. I am a sucker for the love/hate relationship thing, I\'ll be honest. I don\'t know why. Add it to my list of issues. But whether it\'s Jardan or Spuffy or the good old Fitzbeth, I\'m all for a bit of ""I hate you, let\'s fuck"" angst.Olive and Ethan, though, are not enemies. Sure, she calls him her ""nemesis"" and declares how awful it\'s going to be going to Maui with him, blah blah, but it seems pretty clear to me from the beginning that they really love bickering with each other. They don\'t hate each other! They\'re not enemies! Their first conversation makes them seem like an old married couple bitching at each other. In fact, I find it weird how Olive basically fabricates some faux-hatred at the start, but is later very easily forgiving when, in my opinion, Ethan was completely in the wrong.So far this has definitely sounded more negative, but it is a fun, easy read. I like how both Olive and Hazel are unwilling to apologize for who they are and the way their bodies look. I like the back-and-forth between Olive and Ethan:“Ethan, I’m a terrible liar.”“Really? You hid it so well.”“It’s never been my strength, okay? Those of us who aren’t summoned by the Dark Mark consider honesty to be a virtue.”I also really liked the single perspective of this story. Seeing as almost every romance novel these days has multiple perspectives, I must be in the minority on this one, but I actually find it much easier to enjoy a romance and fall in love with the object of the MC\'s affections if I\'m reading a single perspective. Getting inside the other person\'s head dampens some of the tension for me.Oh, and I also liked the super hot massage scene. For obvious reasons.Hell, I don\'t even know at this point. It\'s not like I\'m not having a bit of mindless fun with these books, but with so little time to read, do I really want to keep spending it with 3-star reads? Huh. Maybe I\'ll try one more.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'You guys are messing with me, right? Because there is no wayThe Unhoneymoonersis Christina Lauren\'s most popular book.Going in, all the gushing reviews would have me believing this is a sure bet, that I was in for a fun time the likes of which only this author duo can deliver. After all, I enjoy a good love/hate relationship as much as the next girl. But coming out, I\'m left wondering if I read the same book as everyone else.The story starts off strong. The initial pages were bubbly and charming as events unfold that lead to Olive and Ethan ending up in Maui together. But not soon after, the awkward train arrives, and my enjoyment of this book completely falls apart.You guys, I don\'t understand this coupling at all. There is no chemistry between them. They\'re cold towards each other one moment, then hot the next. Love/hate relationships are only fun if I can understand the whys of one and the other, but all I got here was whiplash trying to follow along.As far as I can tell, Olive likes Ethan solely because he\'s attractive. On every page, Olive mentions his muscles, his abs, his biceps, his beautiful face, his long lashes, his blue eyes... it goes on and on. Yeah okay, I get it, he\'s a good looking dude! At the same time, she hates him because she thinks he doesn\'t like her. And the only reason Ethan gives for liking Olive is her boobs. I\'m sorry, I didn\'t realize we were back in the eighth grade again.What\'s more, the supposedly flirty banter between them makes me cringe in embarrassment, especially for Olive. She tries so hard in their interactions to be snarky, but it comes across as forced, inappropriate, and awkward. And she reads into everything he says and ends up incorrectly interpreting almost everything. It was exhausting. And Ethan doesn\'t help, giving signals he\'s thinking about his ex, then acting like a clueless dumbass when Olive is hurt.Usually a romance either has a few explicit steamy scenes or the author can chose to let it all happen behind closed doors, and either is fine with me. But this book oddly tries to straddle both. There\'s no explicit scenes shown, but instead we are told constantly at random, unrelated times that they happened, a lot. Yes, cue even more awkwardness.And on top of all this, the last 100 pages took a complete left turn into Stupid Town (population: this book), for no reason I could discern. The story was pretty much all wrapped up, and then it kept going right off of a cliff. When someone you care about tells you that they got an unwanted advance and it made them uncomfortable, your response should not be in the vein of, ""I don\'t believe it. Really it\'s he said/she said. And what does it matter what the truth is anyways?"" Come on, you guys, am I really supposed to cheer for these clowns?As you can see, I\'m a little bit baffled. Try as I might, I just can\'t seem to find the love for this book that everyone else clearly adores. Boring, cringey, and awkward are not words I want to associate with my romcoms, not to mention whatever the last 100 pages was.This is my second book by this author duo, and at this point, I\'m starting to wonder if maybe they aren\'t for me. In both, silly main characters doing questionable things make it hard for me to see them as viable romantic leads, which ultimately defeats the purpose of a romance anyways.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:The Soulmate EquationThe True Love ExperimentMy Favorite Half-Night Stand~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'never in my life have i read a book that had the same sense of humour as me - until now. this is honestly one of the funniest books i have ever read. i was giggling like a dweeb pretty much throughout the entire thing. gosh, its such a depressing thought to know i will never be as funny as olive and ethan.the charming humour aside, this might be the best execution of the enemies-to-lovers trope since‘the hating game.’is everything in the story convenient? sure. is it super emotionally compelling? not really. but it absolutely nails the fact that relationships dont work unless you know your partner on a friendship level. and i love the natural connection that developed between olive and ethan.my only complaint would be that the ending is a little rushed. there is a massive shift in story dynamic when olive and ethan return from their trip (almost feels like an entirely seperate story) and it just feels like it ends too soon. i think there are some things that could have been explored more and i honestly wouldnt have minded a longer book. oh well. still a fantastic story overall!↠4.5 stars'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'me, normally:the concept of romantic love is nothing but a marketing scheme for greeting card companies, a lie sold by the government, a-me, after reading this book:[through an oversized megaphone] CAN SOME ROMANTIC SHIT HAPPEN TO ME ALREADY DAMN'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4.5/5This was cute as heck!!'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Total waste of time…* A couple with no chemistry or no connection whatsoever.* A hatred for two and a half years for no reason at all - or a stupid one that is not understandable.* A story that is not even funny at all other than a few good jokes but they cannot save this book.* A boring and lame relationship that never feels like romance. It doesn\'t make you feel.* A heroine who is quirky and a hero to hate! They make a couple like cartoon characters.*********************************************That’s the short summary of the book. Here’s a longer one:The hero (Ethan) likes the heroine (Olive) when they first meet and she also thinks he is a hot guy. Ethan actually wants to ask Olive out but his brother, who is going out with her twin sister, says “No"". He says that she is a bitter person and she is his girlfriend’s twin sister and it would be weird and he listens to him.He listens to him!!!! and goes out with other women! Then he has a serious relationship with a woman, he proposes to her but she leaves him.I should have stopped reading when I saw what a lame guy he was by listening to his brother but for some dumb reason, I still tried hoping it would get better.*********************************************As I said, his brother is the douche-bag boyfriend/fiancé and later husband of Olive\'s twin sister, Ami, whom we later discover that is a cheater. Dane is a cheater and a liar and he is a manipulative bastard!When Ami and Dane are getting married, all the wedding guests, including the bride and the groom get poisoned by the buffet food, it’s only Ethan and Olive, who are left unaffected because they didn’t eat from the buffet. Everyone is so very sick and Ethan and Olive end up going to the honeymoon not to waste it.*********************************************Their hatred is based upon nothing at all. Ethan\'s brother said she was a pessimistic and bitter person so he hates Olive based on it. What a tool! And Olive thinks that Ethan thinks she is fat and unattractive so she hates him. What a fool!Whatever! In the hotel they stay, they join every stupid activity that bore me to death! And there, they see Olive\'s future boss and Ethan\'s ex-grilfriend with her new fiancé and they decide to pretend. This pretension slowly diminishes their hatred and feelings start to emerge but it is so badly written that I never felt their chemistry or I never actually believed in their feelings.*********************************************The romance is so very badly written all along the book. Only a few jokes are funny and I smiled a few times. But the romance was so bad… so very bad… And the whole story was utterly boring! A yawn fest, indeed!And when they finally get intimate, there are onlya few kisses and then fade to black scenes…Seeing how badly the writers write the kissing scenes, it might be good that they didn’t try to write a love-making scene but still I hate “fade to black” love-making scenes!*********************************************It was also frustrating that the writers wrote embarrassing scenes to make it funny, such as falling on the bathroom floor naked on top of each other before there was anything between them.Oh, and then, there was a naked massage he had to apply to her and she was both embarrassed and turned on - yeap, he HAD TO do it while she was naked just because the massage therapist who thought they were married offered it and they thought they should pretend... Pretend, my as*! This is utter stupidity that the writers are trying to make us believe!*********************************************OK, with such an “emotion-less” and “boring” story that gets to be funny very rarely, I was already going to rate it low (maybe 2 or 3 stars) but it soon earned its 1 star when the hero showed how lame he really was (I would give it a zero star if I could, by the way).Here is what happens that made me go crazy with anger!The twin-sister Ami’s husband Dane is the hero’s brother, as you might remember, and he cheats on his wife. He cheated on her many times all along these years while they were going out and now when they are married, he still cheats on her.When Ethan talks about his brother’s affairs to Olive, she is frustrated on her sister’s behalf but Ethan believes that his brother is perfect so he insists that Ami should know they had an open relationship and she was ashamed to tell it to Olive. (what a reasoning!) However, they are twins and Olive is so sure that her sister thought they were exclusive. Still, Ethan doesn\'t want her to talk about this to Ami and for the time being, she agrees.When they come back from the honeymoon, the married couple sees that their siblings are now together. First they are shocked but then, they seem to accept it. One day, the disgusting brother Dane hits on our heroine Olive (as if all the women he was cheating on his wife with weren\'t enough already). And the pig suggests that they can spice things up by changing partners. Such a low person! She already was angry with him and when he suggests this, she is furious!And when she talks to Ethan about what his brother did, our heroDOESN’T BELIEVEhis girlfriend!!!!He just cannot believe his brother would do that!!!!She insists that he DID propose it but he still doesn’t believe her and when they cannot agree, he breaks up with her…Yeap, hebreaks up with her!!!!She asks him what she could gain by lying about him but Ethan doesn\'t have the brains to understand that the woman who he has witnessed as the worst liar in the world cannot lie about such an important thing. During the honeymoon, he saw how bad she was at pretending and how she couldn\'t tell lies easily. And he doesn\'t even give her the benefit of the doubt. Only a woman who is a fool and misunderstands people easily or an evil woman with a hidden agenda would tell such a lie and Ethan puts the woman he supposedly loves in one of (if not both) categories.And the writers must have thought that wasn\'t bad enough, so when the time comes and she talks to her sister Ami, she also doesn’t believe that her husband cheats on her and that he also hit on her own sister.She accuses her sister of being evil!!!! I never liked Ami anyways and I was right about her.Our poor heroine is blamed by the two most important people in her life: the man she loves and her own twin sister.And weeks later, Ami discovers her husband\'s cheating ways and as you might guess, when Ethan sees it with his own eyes, he feels sorry for thinking his brother is the perfection. He apologizes to Olive a few times and she forgives him and I want to throw my kindle at the wall, yelling, “How could you forgive him, you fool!!!??” But of course, I don’t, as this lame book is not worthy enough to sacrifice my Kindle.But seriously, imagine this:Your boyfriend’s brother hits on you and suggests you should have sex for a change to spice things up. Obviously, you feel disgusted. You talk to your boyfriend about it and he doesn’t believe you. He doesn’t even offer to go talk to him to make sure there is a misunderstanding – he just believes his brother would never do that and says you must have misunderstood (because you are such a fool!) or making it up because you hate him.Then, because you cannot agree on this matter, he breaks up with you.Well, some time later, when he sees with his own eyes that his brother is a douche-bag and a cheater, he understands that you might be right about him, so he comes and says he is sorry and he wants you back.Would you forgive him?If you would, then feel free to try this book…I would never ever forgive such a lowlife! A man who does this once will do more and worse things later. Nope, this is something unforgivable in my book!NOTE TO SELF:Add these writers to your avoid shelf! After 2 huge disappointments and one mediocre read, it\'s time to stop trying their work.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""A humorous enemies-turn-lovers romance fills out the first half ofThe Unhoneymooners. It's engaging, funny, and sexy. But the co-written aspect of this novel makes itself known as the storyline morphs into a more dramatic second half with several climaxes related to career, trust, family, and relationships. In my opinion, this reading experience felt like two different books were placed under the same cover, and I quite liked the fun one more. However, overall,The Unhoneymoonersis indeed enjoyable and will surely satisfyChristina and Lauren's many fans.

You've got an enemies-to-lovers & fake-dating thing. You've got lots of wit and a whole lot of humor. And unlike most Christina Lauren books, you get a really satisfying conclusion.The Unhoneymooners is about Olive and Ethan who, due to some unlucky circumstances, are forced to go on a honeymoon together. Even though they hate each other. While in paradise, they come face to face with their own relationship and (unlucky again) are forced to put on a show when people from their real life appear in Maui.I liked pretty much everything about this book. I thought the pacing worked really well. I liked the contrast between Olive/Ethan's relationship with that of her twin sister Ami/Ami's husband. I liked that there weren't any super big and crazy declarations of love early on, but you could definitely understand Olive and Ethan's attraction and communication style. It just worked.I also really liked the plot twist and conflict in this book. Often times in romance, the conflict between two seemingly happy, honeymoon-phase characters is shaken by miscommunication or something equally contrived. But I felt like the conflict in this was extremely realistic and made sense given the context.The only reason this isn't a 5 star read for me is the lack of true character depth. I think both of the characters had realistic personalities and definitely weren't one dimensional but I also didn't feel the strongest connection to either of them. They worked really well as a pair but individually I wasn't overwhelmed with love.Overall this was such a fun read, and lovers of Sally Thorne will swoon reading this.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'ARC provided by Gallery Books in exchange for an honest review.“That’s the point of luck: it happens when and where it happens.”This is my favorite Christina Lauren book sinceRoomies! I’ll be honest, I wasn’t too in love withJosh and Hazel\'s Guide to Not DatingorMy Favorite Half-Night Stand, but this felt like the famous duo was back and resecured that special place in my swoon-worthy romance heart. This was so funny, this was so heartwarming, and since I’m leaving in a few weeks for Hawaii, the setting was pretty perfect for me, too! This is a hate to love, enemies to lovers, fake dating romance that features two characters who are forced to be around each other because their siblings are marrying each other.➽Olive Torres- Biracial (white and Mexican), twin of the bride, has been unlucky her entire life.➽Ethan Thomas- Brother of the groom, and Olive’s archnemesis.“I want to say something sassy, but the only coherent thought that comes to mind is how insulting it is that eyelashes like his were wasted on Satan’s Errand Boy, so I just give a perfunctory nod and turn down the hall.”And these two had a very rocky, and very confusing, first meeting. But they are trying their best to put their differences aside for this wedding, even if they are antagonizing each other every single chance they get. But the wedding takes an unexpected turn when everyone gets sick from the seafood buffet that was served, except for Olive and Ethan, since neither of them ate from it.Their siblings insist that they take their Hawaii honeymoon, instead of letting the trip go to waste! And they both decide to, because once they get to Maui, they won’t have to see each other except for sleeping. That is, until Olive\'s boss and Ethan’s ex fiancé happen to be at the same resort, and they are forced to play the part of happy newlyweds, because Olive doesn’t want to get caught using their sibling’s honeymoon by the resort and be forced to pay for it out of their own pocket, and Ethan doesn’t want his ex to see him single. And honestly? It was just the perfect fake dating setup, let’s be real.“The problem with lying about relationships is that humans are fickle, fickle creatures.”And I truly believe the banter in this book is the best that these authors have ever crafted. It’s smart, witty, and truly hilarious. I also just loved Olive and Ethan as characters so much, and I easily shipped them together; maybe harder than any Christina Lauren characters. The setting was perfect, the plot was genius, and this was just an overall really easy book to escape into and love.But I am very curious to see how plus-sized reviewers are going to feel about the representation in this book. This is not my lane, so please know that while reading this paragraph, but this book puts a huge emphasis on how Olive thinks Ethan fat-shamed and body-shamed her. She constantly talks about her body, her curves, her stress baking and eating, and how things look on her body, and even tears clothing that’s too small for her, while always kind of comparing herself to her thin twin sister. Like, I was 100% sure Olive was plus-sized through the entire start of this book, but then, once they arrive in Hawaii, it seems like the only big and curvy thing about her is her breasts, which are obviously perfect! And then, at the end of this book it starts feeling like she and her thin sister are identical in bodies, too, and she also gets compared to Selena Gomez. Like, I just didn’t understand. It was like they wanted to have a plus-sized main character, but they didn’t want to actually go there or hire any beta readers. Like, again, this isn’t my lane, and I’m obviously not saying that thin people can’t have body dysmorphia or just have unhealthy relationships with food and their bodies, but the way this read personally felt bad to me. I just honestly think this book could be really triggering because of the emphasis it has on Oliva’s relationship with food and her inner monologue about her thoughts about her body, while also painting a very hazy picture of her actual body.Also, there is a very small conversation between Olive’s family members questioning if a family member is queer, and… it was really badly done.""Because lesbians use those strap-on things""and apparently have short haircuts. And I completely understand it was supposed to be funny because older generations “don’t get it” or whatever, but it wasn’t cute; it was offensive and poorly done. And the mom saying she wishes she was born a lesbian, like… gag me with any spoon you can find. Like, it was so minuscule, and I have no idea why it was even part of the book or why editors thought it was a good thing to keep included, but it just made me side eye and put a bad taste in my mouth.Okay, I know those last two paragraphs seem bad, and they are, I’m not making light of them whatsoever! But I will say that if you took those two elements out, this is a really good book. Like, the best I’ve read from Christina Lauren in years. It was laugh out loud funny, it was romantic and swoon worthy, and I really shipped this enemies to lovers dynamic. I never wanted to leave Olive, Ethan, or Hawaii, and I think this is just going to be the ultimate beach read of 2019.Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Tumblr|Youtube|TwitchThe quotes above were taken from an ARC and are subject to change upon publication.Content and trigger warningsfor talk of cheating (not the main characters), A LOT of talk about food and bodies that I think could be potentially triggering, and the brief but questionable conversation about sexuality that I mentioned above.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'When I die I want Christina Lauren to lower me into my grave so they can let me down one last time.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Este libro tiene todos los clichés que más amo: Enemies to lovers, matrimonio falso, SÓLO HAY UNA CAMA Y DEBEMOS COMPARTIRLA OMG.Toda la primera mitad la amé con locura, la disfruté un montón y me reí bastante, peeeero la segunda mitad toma un rumbo que no me encantó.

Truth be told, this is the onlyChristina Laurento date that has earned less than four stars from this reader. And believe me, as someone who’s been a longtime fan of their work, it would be so much easier to gloss over the things that bothered me, as opposed to confessing this didn’t work for me in its entirety, but it is what it is. So, hear me out. Or not. Your choice.Was the journey fun and light?For sure.Were the coauthors successful in pulling out the laughs?You bet.Even more importantly, were there swoon-worthy moments capable of rousing my inner giddy and giggly gal?Of course.Was it up to snuff with some of the duo\'s other novels?Nope.This time around,Christina Laurenbrings readers to the Twin Cities for a wedding paid for entirely with sweepstakes and giveaways wins. In hindsight, maybe partaking in afreeseafood buffet isn’t the best idea. Food poisoning, anyone? How about everyone? Well, except for the two people who opted for the chicken plate instead. When optimistic Ami and her new groom find they can’t peel themselves off the bathroom floor, let alone think about heading to Maui for their all expenses paid honeymoon, they enlist their siblings to take their places—aka the pessimistic twin sister Olive and her “nemesis” Ethan.While there are some hilarious one-liners and dialogue—total laugh out loud moments—exchanged between the “enemies”, it takes reading half of the novel (around 200 pages) before anything couply transpires between Olive and Ethan. In the meantime, readers are fed a steady diet of faux hatred and convenient situations. Running into one person you know from home, okay I’ll bite. Maybe I’ll even refrain from rolling my eyes. But two, when you’re an eleven-hour flight away on a tropical island? Come on ladies, dig a little deeper next time. There were so many other ways the situations and feelings inspired by those “chance encounters” could have been introduced into the storyline. Just saying.With the epilogue being the exception, the entirety of the story is told from Olive’s perspective, which is a bit of departure for the duo (Roomiesbeing the only other, I think?) and kind of a downer. Even more so considering the co-authors attempted to sell this whole “nemesis” idea. Seeing their rivaling thoughts firsthand would have fed into the fun. Instead, readers are privy only to Olive’s thoughts, while facial expressions and dialogue have to suffice for Ethan. The perfect breeding ground for misinterpretations and assumptions. And the borderline simplistic idea—by some standards—that the crux of the entire novel relies on.In some respects, this enemies-to-lovers storyline presents as disjointed and weak. The pacing itself is consistently inconsistent. Slow to progress at points, yet too much all at once in others. It screamed for more storyline development and actions driven by emotion, as opposed to enlisting those things simply to get the characters where they needed to be for things to ""work"".When Olive and Ethan return home, after ten days in paradise, there are a host of issues for the pessimist to contend with: finding a career that feeds her passion, realigning her outlook on life, appreciation for her family and a desire for love. The authors utilize Olive and Ami’s large extended family here, but there are no standout moments that hit home or provide any emotional value, instead conjuring those feelings of convenience once again. Not to mention, I imagine it would be a tad overwhelming foranyoneto attempt to tackle their entire outlook on life in such a short timeframe (100-ish pages?). Look who the pessimist is now.*wink*All of that complaining aside,turning the pages was effortless. Sure, there were a few times when it felt like I was simply going through the motions, but for the most part,The Unhoneymoonerswas delightfully fun. Not quite special enough to knockJosh and Hazel—the quirky couple who garnered hordes of fans with their infamous guide to not dating—from the throne, but entertaining enough.For me, it was Olive and Ethan’s perfectly imperfect ending that proved the journey worthy. Bonus points to the writing duo for offering readers a much-needed glimpse of life from Ethan’s adoring eyes.*A HUGE thank you to Gallery for sending my gorgeous copy.

I adore Olive and Ethan so much and I'm a huge fan of the trope when a pessimistic person gets paired with an optimist, and I think I love this book especially because Olive is more of a pessimist, realist personality whereas Ethan is the optimist. I feel like it's so rare in romance novels to see the female being the more negative one because usually the females are always trying to make the males more optimistic but in this book it's really opposite, which is why I relate to Olive so much because I tend to be such a pessimist myself so I just really relate to her character, and her close relationship with her twin sister is also something I strongly relate to. I just adore this book so hard and I think it's something I want to reread every now and then because it makes me so damn happy.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Holy shit I loved this so much.Christina Lauren is one of my favorite authors and I was absolutely STOKED when Gallery Books sent me an ARC of their latest romance The Unhoneymooners. I think I honestly have a new favorite from them. This one orAutoboyographyis my favorite book from this author now, ahhh.This is an adorable rom-com that follows this girl named Olive who is chronically unlucky, and her twin sister Ami who is absurdly lucky. Ami is marrying this guy named Dane and Olive can't stand Dane's brother Ethan. At Ami and Dane's wedding, the entire wedding party gets food poisoning except for Olive and Ethan who didn't eat the fish, so Ami tells Olive to take her nonrefundable honeymoon trip to Hawaii and Dane tells his brother Ethan to take the trip: so Ethan and Olive take the trip to Hawaii together.This romance has a lot of my favorite romance tropes: hate to love, slow burn romance, fake dating/fake marriage, it really has it all.I am absolute trash for the fake dating trope I just love it so much and this book does it sooooo well.It's been along time since a romance novel has made me so giddy.I just adore the hell out of Olive and Ethan both, and this book reminded me of one of my all time favorite romances:The Hating Gamebecause their banter isso on point.Like for real,this is one of the funniest fucking books I've ever read, I giggled out loud many times, and I devoured this story is two sittings. I could not put it down. Their chemistry is so contagious, I was grinning form ear to ear the entire time I was reading this. This story would make for the perfect rom-com beachy movie. I could picture it all in my head so vividly.I love Olive's mexican family which reminded me so much of my own.I love her relationship with her twin sister Ami, they were totally adorbs. I also loved how her parents have been separated for so long but never divorced, and her gay cousin Diego. The closeness of their family and the way they supported each other through everything just reminded me so much of my own family and it was just really sweet. Also, Olive's unlucky streak was entertaining as hell and she has some really great stories about unlucky things that have happened to her I was cackling. I tend to be more of a pessimistic person too like Olive so I found her general attitude towards life really relatable.Ethan is my favorite kind of male love interest: he's strong but soft and he seems so rough around the edges but once you get to know him he's a total softy, and he's a cute drunk and he wants to see the best in people and he respects women and he's crazy passionate about his nerdy job and I just adored the shit out of him.I just loved this so so so so much.I've found a new all time favorite romance/OTP/book. I just want to run around recommending this book to everyone and I want to reread it immediately upon finishing it which is always a good sign.

Completely a feel good book with all the fluffy romance and sexy tidbits you'd want in one._______________The StoryThe Unhoneymoonersfollows Olive Torres during a honeymoon that she goes on falsely identifying as her twin sister Ami, who just got married. After a bad case of food poisoning at Ami's wedding, the only two unaffected people are Olive and Ami's husbands brother, Ethan. Ethan and Olive have supposedly hated each other from the moment they met each other, so they both agree to disagree and go on the honeymoon together. What starts as a fake marriage and an excuse for a free holiday soon turns into many misadventures, misencounters and misunderstandings. Soon, Olive and Ethan start to realize that they have immense chemistry between them and maybe they were wrong from the start...Firstly, I want to call it and say that the enemies to lovers trope is going to swoop 2019 away from me like a storm. There is honestly very little that can go wrong with the trope and this book was evidently showed how electric it can be. It truly was such an easy and fast-paced read that had little bouts of sexual tension that made it unputdownable.This was really hard to rate for me. Without giving too much away, the first 65% of the book felt like a 4 -5 star read, full with funny and lovable characters that all had their own charm. However, after that mark something felt so unbalanced and I disliked the way some issues were dealt with alongside some dynamics. Yes, it was unrealistic and the story arcs that were created have been done before, but that still did not take away from how effortless it felt to sink into Olive and Ethan's story. I'm glad the story had no obvious insta-love aspects but during the last quarter there were some cringey lines that felt uncomfortably close.The RomanceAll this book really left me with was a strong desire to go pick up more Christina Lauren books. Not very many romance contemporaries can do that for me, so that was really refreshing. The romance between Olive and Ethan was electric, it sparked and flew off the page. I could feel their hate but I could also feel how slowly they dissolved into each others company. I really enjoyed that Olive is a strong woman that learns her self-worth and sticks up for her curves throughout the story. So all in all the romance was charming.Once the book neared the second half, I could feel my rating drop slightly. I was initially going to give this 4 stars but knew that wouldnt be true to what I thought of the story as a whole. During the end, I started being very cautious about the way that Olive and Ethan solved their problems. With no spoilers, they didn't really solve their problems. Then when a couple chapters passed, there was a massive reveal that I felt needed a bigger reaction from Ethan.With that being said, I loved the family dynamic and the friendship involved with Olive and her relatives. It didn't feel like it was a filler, it felt like it belonged and made the story all the more delightful. But still, I need more girls to stand up for girls this 2019. I really enjoyed this story and definitely will read more of the authors' works.""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'man idk if I just don\'t like romances in general or if I just find straight horny people to be incredibly boring or what it is but these hyped up romance novels keep letting me downThe first half wasn\'t bad - it follows Olive, who\'s twin sister Ami is getting married. When everyone falls sick after the wedding from eating shellfish, everyone except Olive and Ethan, Ami\'s new husband\'s brother. Olive and Ethan don\'t like each other but in the interest of getting free shit they decide to pretend to be married to go on Ami and Dane\'s honeymoon. The premise was fun and even if it was slightly ridiculous, I enjoyed it.The first 50% is essentially just Olive and Ethan getting to know eachother better, sorting out some misunderstandings between them and pretending to be married. Some truly ridiculous shit happens (Ethan\'s ex AND Olive\'s new boss both happen to be there) and while it was unrealistic, I can\'t say I didn\'t enjoy it.I guess where this book falls apart is I didn\'t get the CHEMISTRY. these two people are way too horny for their own good, and all they really do is make horny jokes and their entire relationship is based off of Ethan thinking Olive has good titties and Olive thinking Ethan has good abs. And it\'s not that I can\'t necessarily get behind that, but I did find it boring here. I felt I was reading it like \'yep, that sure is another paragraph about how he\'s hot\' but there was no spark or real connection that made me feel anything about it. I also found a lot of their banter cringey and their characterisation was so predictable (she\'s an awkward klutz who says silly things before thinking, he\'s a stoic brooding type with a heart of gold ect)That said, the majority of the first half was fun and silly and I liked the progression of their relationship and the things they had to do to avoid getting caught out as not being married. And the massage scene did kind of slap.The second half, however .... this is where my rating dropped from a ""it\'s not great but it\'s a three star because I\'m liking it"" to a ""god, I liked it at first but can it end already"" two stars. It\'s hard to talk about the second half without spoiling everything but lets just say it was non-stop heterosexual nonsense, misunderstandings, and people Doing Bad Things that shouldn\'t have been forgiven as easily as they were.There was also some frankly questionable choices made regarding representation, like the plus-sized rep really only there when it was convenient for the plot, and the queer rep ..... well the stereotypical gay side character and the discussion about lesbians ....... yikes. It was unnecessary and made me wince. The final grand gesture scene was also so cringe-worth I had that visceral second-hand embarrassment reaction and I DON\'T enjoy feeling that way.“The problem with lying about relationships is that humans are fickle, fickle creatures.”special mention to the part where the MC makes a harry potter joke and the LI replies with a harry potter joke and the MC is like ""omg ... I knew he liked reading but he likes THE SAME BOOKS AS ME ........... the perfection of this man"" like first of all calm down everyone knows harry potter Ethan isn\'t indie he isn\'t special .. you\'re living in america everyone understands harry potter references. second of all since when is \'harry potter\' a type of book like skfksk. this shit made me roll my eyes so hard.So there we go: I didn\'t really love reading this super hyped romance book and its like a 2.5 star for me purely because I Did genuinely have fun with the beginning to the middle even if it was ridiculous.Do I dislike romance in general, is this a bad book, are horny straight people annoying, or am I just so tired of hetero people writing books about hetero nonsense? chime off in the comments'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '↠ 5 starsHave you ever read a book so romantic it hurts? This left me with an ache in my chest that I can only attribute to Olive and Ethan. Good job guys, now all I want to do is fly to Hawaii and try to recreate your whirlwind romance. The Unhoneymooners takes fake dating, and says, ""Lets level this all the way up to fake marriage, except they hate each other"" and I love it so much. After Olive\'s twin sister\'s entire wedding party comes down with food poisoning, she and the brother of the groom decide to take the honeymoon originally planned for the couple. Doing so means pretending they\'re married, and that despite all their misgivings, maybe they do like each other after all.What can I say, I would throw any current read out the window for an enemies-to-lovers story. The Unhoneymooners is by far the best one I have read in the contemporary romance genre. It\'s a comforting and escapist read that I often return to whenever I feel the need. Reading this for the first time is like being enveloped in warmth. I don\'t know, the tenderness and yearning really got to me I guess. Christina Lauren have created a story so hilarious and imaginative that watching it all play out is like nothing you\'ve ever read before. The Unhoneymooners essentially said, the real villain is miscommunication, and while I am not a person who usually goes for that, I\'m surprised to say I really enjoyed it. However, my favorite thing about this novel is the focus on these two people working towards communicating effectively and building a healthy relationship. What I often see is characters overcoming initial barriers and then riding off into the sunset together without a care in the world, contrary to how life works. This book shows just part of the work that goes into being in a relationship with another person, beyond those initial steps. It also doesn\'t hurt that the main couple is freakin adorable. Seriously. This book basically made me crave a vacation romance that will never happen. But isn\'t creating insane expectations and scenarios for yourself after reading a romance novel the whole point to reading them in the first place?Trigger warnings:cheating, manipulation, toxic relationships, fatphobia, alcohol consumption'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '""When I signed up for this honeymoon, I had no idea it would involve so much nudity.""Raise your glass to another winner from Christina Lauren! *clink* This writing duo features my go-to gals when it comes to romantic comedies. Seriously, I can\'t remember the last time an author consistently made me chortle so hard or forced me to sustain multiple gut busters in a row. Last time I checked, we could all use a few more good vibes all over the world, and if you\'re looking for another feel good time, this is your stop. Get off the TBR bus right now; hurry or you\'ll miss it!I immediately connected with Olive and her plight to fight the system that forces prejudice against the curvy girl. Seriously, a female lead who not only inhales cheese curds at the fair and makes no apologies for it, but also holds anyone accountable who tries to fat shame her?This girl is my hero.Olive and Ethan are the ""unlikeliest couple"" ever, which means of course they have to get together, because this is my all time favorite trope.Let\'s give a standing ovation for the enemies-to-lovers plot!Ethan is a seemingly OCD/stuffy know-it-all, who honestly came off as a standard dick in the beginning.But Chelsea, isn\'t there some underlying reason why he\'s coming across as such a shallow turd muncheryou ask? Obviously, but we\'ll get there in due time. This pair contains the only two people at Olive\'s sister\'s wedding who didn\'t come down with an unfortunate, fancy case of food poisoning. Sister Amy insists that Olive take the non-refundable, all inclusive honeymoon to Hawaii, while brother Dane insists that Ethan takes it. Even though Olive and Ethan despise each other, they are both stubborn as an ox and refuse to let the other have all the fun, so they agree to commit fraud and enjoy a free vacation while spending as little time as possible around each other.We all know how this story goes, and I think one of the reasons I pick up these books is for the familiarity and predictability they provide. Even if everything in my life is going haywire, I can count on these two people going through the motions to hit me right in the feels where I need it most. I\'m sure you can guess how 99% of this book will turn out, but what I can\'t emphasize enough is just how laugh-out-loud hilarious it was journeying alongside of Ethan and Olive.The shower changing scene, anyone?While the plot seemed a little less zany and more believable thanJosh and Hazel\'s Guide to Not Dating, I felt the snappy dialogue and witty humor was most on point with that previous story than some of their others. *side note, you can say it\'s unbelievable that twins would end up dating or marrying brothers, but I had a ballet teacher who married her identical twin\'s brother in law. Hope your marriage is still going strong Miss Jamie, and if not, I apologize for bringing it up here.*The reason I went with a 4 star instead of a 5 star rating is a bit complex, and I\'ll try to unpack it below, complete with spoiler tags. While I understand that this is fiction, I felt conflicted about how the book ended. Once Olive and Ethan return from the ""honeymoon"" and insert themselves into real life mode, they have some issues that they have to deal with involving family members on both sides. On the one hand, I love how we see Olive grow as a person, taking ownership for her shortcomings and choices in life, and becoming ok with who she is and finding who she wants to be in her professional career. This portion felt deeper than in previous ""fluffy"" novels, which perhaps raised my expectations on how the ending would handle her and Ethan\'s ""disagreement"".After everything Olive goes through in trying to start a discussion involving Dane\'s unacceptable behavior, I was really disappointed that, after Ethan was such an ass LITERALLY until the last possible second, how quickly Olive took him back and how little everyone seemed to think the way he acted was ok. For me, his behavior was the last in a major list of red flags, and I think an ending on par with CoHo\'s ""It Ends With Us"" where each character finds themselves without getting back together would have been more effective.Obviously, this is just personal preference, and a small blot in an otherwise delicious, steamy, feel good romp. Highly recommended for anyone who needs a good laugh and a story you can fly through in record time.*I received a review copy via the publisher.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4.5 stars - I stayed up later than was probably wise reading this and I have no regrets (yet.. ask me in the morning).Enemies to lovers.

And Olive, well she has no luck at all.Whereas Ami is a four-leaf clover, I have always been unlucky.Ami is getting married and being the overachiever that she is, she’s devised a plan (along with a lot of luck) to get her wedding paid for. And it works out for her. So here is Olive, in a hideous bridesmaid dress having to tolerate her sworn enemy, the grooms brother, Ethan. It’s not her best day. But maybe her luck is beginning to change… I mean, her allergy to shellfish saves her from the serious food poising almost every person at the wedding gets.Ami is so ill she can’t go on her own honeymoon. And since it’s a non-refundable free trip, she insists Olive pretends to be her and goes in her place. Ethan, who also missed the food poising due to his aversion to buffets is invited to go as well. So here Olive is. With Ethan. On an romantic, exclusive get away. You can tell where this is going, right? Yes. And it’s going to be so much fun!I loved watching Ethan and Olive together. They seriously cracked me up. Olive is an endearing main character. Her luck was awful, but maybe at the end she really did end up being the lucky one. And Ethan. Ethan is hilarious, sweet, and completely misunderstood. Olive realizes that soon enough.I find myself smiling in the direction of the living room, and realize that staying firmly on Team I Hate Ethan Thomas is going to be more work than it may be worth.Where this was a fun rom-com, there were also a lot of obstacles this couple faced.

I jumped into this knowing I was getting into a romcom. I was waiting forpeople we meet on vacationfeels orWall of Winnipegswoons and I got abig pile of the most obnoxious, insufferable writingand plot devices I\'ve seen in a looooong time.This author managed to write the same book twice...inside of the same book.Does that make sense? Let\'s start with the fact that this wasnearly 700 pages longand every time the main characterPOUTEDbecause she needed caffeine, I wanted to live a little less.I need to be fair... Some of the sex scenes were sweet, and this couple could have been cute. This book just had to beAT LEAST 300 pages shorterand the characters had to have a personality and the maturity of a normal human being and not sound like they were all 12. I don\'t think that is too much to ask, honestly.This book managed to include every single thing I hate in romcoms, every-single-thing.Leaving the EXTREMELY obnoxious, forced and stereotypical gay representation in this aside...Let\'s start with the fact that some authors just go overboard with their ""sunshine"" characters. Why does every sunshine woman need to be co-dependent? Why can\'t you write a NORMAL bubbly woman, who knows how to be a functional adult?Nooooooo, but that\'s not stereotypical enough. A sunshine character is quirky!!! She loves coffee! She can\'t remember where she parked her car! She is so entertaining!! Did I mention sheLOOOOOOOOOOVEScoffee? Oh I didn\'t? Don\'t worry, the author will make her groan and pout 22 times while she\'s thinking about coffee before chapter 10, and that is just soooooooooo sexy.We need to be done with the idea that bubbly women are stupid and helpless women. I can\'t relate to female characters like that.Have you ever met a woman?In what world would a woman not know what to do in a crisis situation?!She cries to a complete stranger and asks him:please, help me, what should I do?5 times in the first two chapters. The fact that a 40 year old man finds a broken shell of a woman attractive is a red flag of its own.There are so many things that annoyed the fuck out of me in this book, none of this plot made sense. None of this was down-to-earth, realistic, everything felt forced, all the jokes and the stereotyping were taken to a MAXIMUM.Oh Julia, but it\'s fiction. Give it a rest. I have a list of romantic comedies with sunshine and grumpy characters that were written like a damn masterpiece. This one is just bad, I am sorry.How do you expect me to find their childish bickering from chapter 1 attractive and sexy?The most mature character in this entire book was an 11 year old.Honorable mentions to:""I knew you\'d have a ""fuck me body""sentence that came out of our hero\'s mouth at some point during their first time.She filled 700 pages with the same back and forth, multiple times, and I think 300 of those pages were inner dialogues of Knox being the most pathetic 40 year old I have ever met and our female lead thinking about coffee, orgasms or having chats with her gay best friend who knows everythinggggg about hair!!Spare me.This could have been anok, sweet story if she just had dialed it down a notch, had not repeated herself 300 times and written normal, down-to-earth characters.I am honestly annoyed at the misrepresentation of gay characters. I am sick of bubbly women being portrayed as stupid and helpless, I am sick of men\'s lack of emotional responsibility and maturity being down-played, forgiven easily and used as a plot device. (And I am a dark romance reader so that’s saying something)This was a bad, boring, over-the-top stupid, over-hyped book.Sorry, that is my brutally honest review.It\'s ok if you liked this book.

The small snippets you see of him in this book is going to make you fall and fall hard. I hadn’t even finished the book at the time when I decided that he was gonna be my next obsession. (Ofc he’s gonna come second to Mr. Bearded Badboy Grumpy Knox Morgan because that man is everythiiiing)^ here’s how I picture Knox… you know that guy on TikTok with the axe who breaks apart those tree trunks??? THAT MAN???? In my head, that’s him 🤪 (If you don’t like fan casting, then just forget I said anything ���)I thought I was deluding myself when I finished this book?! I thought to myself, “did I really love this??? Or was this just the first book I got excited for in what feels like a while??”NOPEEEEE. Two things can be true. It was the first book that left me feeling so excited AND I really loved it.There is a happily ever after, and not only do we get one epilogue, BUT ALSO A BONUS EPILOGUE. Seriously, in that bonus epilogue?!?!? With Way and Knox and the way they spoke to each other?! OH MY GOD MY HEART EXPLODED!!When I finish a book, I’m usually at a loss for how to review it especially when it’s been a while since I finished it, but I think this is one of my fastest written reviews lmaooooo. I just really loved this book and highly highly recommend it.It’s a pretty long book, about 500-600 pages (can’t remember) but it didn’t read that long to me at all. I got through it so quickly. I couldn’t put it down.There are just so many good parts in this book that I genuinely head-over-heels enjoyed. How grumpy this man is, the support he gives Naomi, the love and encouragement and pep talks he gave Way. UGH!!! ❤️\u200d🔥 I wanna read it again byeeee'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""This is a story about a nice woman who gets into an abusive relationship, and the author calls it romance.I've read a lot of rom-coms, and this book is neither rom nor com.

The number of strong reviews for this book and positive views of the main male character is truly disturbing. I mean, he even renames her!

OHHH.. okay THAT’S her name, Knox calling her Daisy all the time was only an endearment I see, and it was because Dai-Naomi had flowers in her hair when he met her..oh now I get it.The fact that I only realized now that I had the heroine’s name wrong this whole time, it’s embarrassing ahahahaha. Just for that alone, I’m sorry I can’t give this book 4 stars with good conscious, even tho I had mostly a good time reading it, but if I can’t even recall the first name of the main character, I don’t know what else my fragile mind blocked out. 🕳️🏃🏻\u200d♀️“Why are you whispering?”“Because he lives right there,” I said, pointing my glass in the direction of Knox’s cabin.“Oooh.

Yet, they areacting like irritating kindergarten kidswho are obsessed with actions similar to Disney characters in some parts of the book and liketoxic, emotionally manipulating, and stalking characters in the other parts.Character developmentis one of the most important aspects of a novel; the characters create and push the plot forward. I felt that this book's flawed character development sadly pulls the story backward.It looks like the author was totally confused about the mannerisms given to her characters. So she vacillates between polar opposite behaviors with a lot of unnecessary smut in unexpected, strange circumstances.There is a big difference between some banter and being toxic.To make things even worse this book has more than500 pages. The blurb of this book looked promising, and many of my friends gave high ratings for it. So I read it cover to cover, hoping the author would revive it at some stage.

Evil Twin Sister then steals Naomi\'s car and money leaving poor Naomi stuck in Knockemout. Evil Twin Sister has apparently managed to piss off the entirety of Knockemout, despite only living there for a year, and so everyone hates Naomi at first sight. But Naomi is beautiful and perfect and friendly and amazing, so she quickly wins everyone over, except for Grumpy Bad Boy Knox Morgan.This is a TropeTastic book–mistaken identity, enemies to lovers, forced proximity, fake dating, good girl/bad boy, and grumpy x sunshine are all of the tropes that I can think of off the top of my head. And the book suffered for it. The only reason this book needed to be almost 600 pages was so the author could squeeze in every possible romance trope that she could think of. And despite all of these great tropes–they might be cliches but they\'re so popular because they work–this book sucked. I\'m sorry but I\'m not sorry. Usually I save one star ratings for books that offend me with some form of racism or internalized misogyny or romanticizations of abusive relationships. This book teetered on the latter two issues but never fully delved into them, but I still couldn\'t bring myself to give this book two stars.🌼 I couldn\'t stand the hero or the heroine. Naomi is a perfect goody-two shoes, so beautiful that every single guy has a hard-on for her, so nice that any person who talks to her instantly wants to be her friend. Her fatal flaw is that shecares too muchand no one ever cares about her in return.Yawn.🌼 Knox is The Worst. This book tries to be a grumpy x sunshine book, but Knox isn\'t just grumpy. He\'s an angry, controlling, manipulative hypocrite with daddy issues. He constantly pushes Naomi around, literally, even though it\'s supposed to be romantic because he\'s a big, sexy man? I can\'t believe the author had the audacity to write a hero so physically controlling for her heroine whojust ran away from an abusive relationship.And when Knox broke things off with Naomi for literally no reason, he had the audacity to tell her, ""Can\'t we be fucking adults about this?"" Look in the goddamn mirror, Knox.🌼 This book just didn\'t know what it wanted to be. There was the main romance plotline, full of all the tropes mentioned above, but there were so many subplots. Again, this book really didn\'t need to be 600 pages and it desperately needed an editor.🌼 The characters were so one-dimensional and every issue/inconvenience felt extremely contrived. For instance, the ongoing subplot of Naomi trying to impress the CPS lady. In the end, it turned out to be a non-issue and only existed so the CPS lady could give Naomi advice about Knox.🌼 This book descends into Life Lesson territory so fast. I don\'t read books to feel lectured, and I didn\'t need every single character to have a drawn-out heart-to-heart with each other to grasp the main meanings behind this book. I\'m starting to think that subtlety in writing is a lost art.🌼 I almost forgot that one of Knox\'s main character traits is that he won the lottery. And when it\'s first mentioned, they talk about how Knox wassmart with his moneyand didn\'t blow it all on random things, so he\'s still a millionaire today. But throughout the entire book, Knox is so stupid with money. He quite literally throws his money at people to buy their affection. He likes to use his money to try and control people and resorts to bribery to get his way. And I\'m supposed to believe this is a guy who issmart and benevolent with his money?Nope.🌼 Despite everything happening in this book, the characters were so flat that I couldn\'t find it in myself to ever care about them. The only two characters that intrigued me were Waylay and Evil Twin Sister. By the way, Evil Twin Sister is apparently a scourge on the earth because she couldn\'t handle having a perfect twin sister. She\'s the most black-and-white villain ever. I wanted more depth to her; I like having complicated villains. But nope, that would require a subtlety and nuance that this author apparently is allergic to.🌼 I really didn\'t understand Knox\'s reasons for being so anti-relationship and I honestly didn\'t really care. The man is supposed to be in his mid-forties but he had the emotional maturity of a nineteen-year-old frat boy. Build a bridge and get over your issues because you\'re making yourself and everyone around you miserable.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""I am writing this review with a heavy heart, because as fiercely as I loved the author’s other work, especially the Benevolence series, Bootleg Springs series, By a Thread, the Christmas Fix, the Worst Best Man, Rock Bottom Girl, etc., I felt the complete opposite after reading Things We Never Got Over. I generally do not include spoilers in my review, but am citing a few examples from the story to explain my low rating. If you don’t like spoilers, read no further.Knox Morgan our “hero” was anything but in my opinion. While I love an alpha and a growly grump with a squishy marshmallow center, I felt Knox was a condescending, self-righteous, steamrolling jerk.The story takes place in the small town of Knockemout, Virginia, where Knox lives in a cabin on the same property that he shares with his widowed grandmother. He’s 43 and won $11 million in the lottery a few years back which caused a rift between him and his only brother, Nash, the town’s chief of police, whom I adored. It wasn’t an argument over money, as Knox did offer him a generous share, it was how Knox reacted when Nash refused. Knox was arrogant and demeaning, and treated Nash horribly from beginning to end in my opinion. While not estranged, Knox obviously held resentments and needed professional help. Nash was a good man, level headed and honorable, and did not deserve it.We meet our heroine, Naomi, the day after she leaves her fiancé (for good reason) at the altar and blows into town in a whirlwind to help her evil twin sister, Tina. With a hopeful heart and generous spirit, Naomi once again falls into her trap and is blindsided by her wickedness as she stole her car and ransacked her hotel room. But her frown turned upside down when she was introduced to her adorable 11-year-old niece, Waylay, and agrees to become her guardian, even though she’s not sure how she will manage.When Knox meets Naomi at a local coffee shop, he believes she is her identical twin, causes a scene, and is anything but pleasant. I loved the sass she volleyed back to Knox and how easily she could read him and was not intimidated. Upon learning she is “not Tina” (her nickname did make me laugh), Knox offers to help her by belting out directives and taking her to an adorable cottage on his grandmother’s property. Naomi was ever so grateful and humble, and things were looking up as she was able to work out a deal with Liza J.Knox showed no respect to his brother when he officially came to investigate the break-in and car theft. The tension was so thick between the brothers that Knox egged Nash on and challenged him to a fight saying, “I saw her first.” Nash may have thrown the first punch, but after Knox punched his brother in the face, he internalized that “messing up Nash was always gratifying.” It was the first of several fistfights that Knox got into, which is a really big turn off for me.Naomi scored a job and didn’t realize it was at the local bar Knox owned. She was tired and nervous, as she never worked in the restaurant industry before, and instead of welcoming her, Knox humiliated her and demanded she “get out,” and that he “didn’t want her around.” He said, “I’m not working with some uppity, needy pain in the a$$.”This is the same woman who just had her whole life upended–and he knew this! She left her fiancé, quite her job, left her home, was missing her wallet, phone and car, taken responsibility for her niece, and was trying to start over, and he was such a crass a-hole. Even though she was a bit naive, Naomi was so sweet and had so much character. She tried her best to keep her composure, worked all night against his wishes to earn a few bucks, and then Knox had a change of heart asking her to stay. He was so hot and cold that it gave me whiplash.I feel Knox suffers from borderline personality disorder (fear of abandonment, unstable relationships, shifting self-image, impulsive, self-destructive, extreme emotional mood swings, chronic feelings of emptiness, and explosive anger.) He also possesses a narcissist’s grandiose sense of self-importance, which leads him to feel a sense of entitlement, and expects everyone to comply with his expectations without question.He was Jekyll and Hyde, gaslighting and mistreating her over and over and yet she still fell in love. Then breaks her heart and leaves...just like he said he would, and has the nerve to sulk! Out of concern Nash asked his brother as to why he broke things off, and Knox replied with, “Problem...with you helping yourself to my leftovers? Nah. Better she didn’t go to waste.”There wasn’t any romance unless you consider the time he offered to take her on a lunch date, then tossed a bagged PBJ onto her lap in his truck, convincing her to partake in an afternoon delight. Sadly, she was starry-eyed and lacked the confidence to kick him to the curb. Her life was constantly filled with drama and stress with her sister’s illegal activities, yet she remained cheerful, tried to do right by her niece planning activities to support her emotional health, all while working two jobs to become financially secure.Watching Waylay feel safe and loved for the first time in her life was really emotional. I was totally invested in their relationship and enjoyed how they got to know one another, were both hopeful for a brighter future, and dealt with Tina’s betrayal. They were victims and survivors, and I admired their strength, perseverance, and positive attitude. Naomi selflessly sold her wedding dress and used it to by her niece clothes, sold her home so she could buy a car, and agreed to clean and organize his grandmother’s house in exchange for rent. She was hardworking, resilient, and a go-getter, earning my total respect.And after Knox tossed Naomi and Waylay “like a discarded receipt he no longer needed,” she held her head high and repeatedly asked him to stop contacting her, but he didn’t respect her wishes and continued to stalk her. Then an incident happened with her sister, and he TOLD her they were getting back together. He never asked her, nor did he apologize, and to my great disappointment, she succumbed. I wish I could jump in the story and tell her that she doesn’t need Knox's scraps of affection and that she deserves better.This story does end with a HEA for the couple, and Knox did make an effort to change towards the end, but it was a little too late for me. We all have hang-ups, but it doesn’t mean we go through life as a jerk. I felt he was emotionally abusive, controlling, and passive-aggressive.Lucy Score is one of my favorite authors, and even though I did not care for the hero of this story, I will be continuing with the series and look forward to seeing who falls in love next in Knockemout. I really liked her friend Stef from home, Simone the local librarian, Nash, her parents, his grandmom, and the local townsfolk.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '2.5 starsI’m gonna bullet point this review for brevity’s sake, because at this point, the general consensus is that everyone loved this book and made it a bestseller so they must have seen something in it that I didn’t.If you loved the book, don’t read this, because I honestly I hated it.• too long for what it actually contained.(spoiler alert, it was mostly sexy scenes which added nothing to the plot)If I read a 600 pages book I’m expecting it to tie all the issues nicely by the end of the book. To provide answers to all the questions andmost importantlyto show me true character growth. This book -did not.• I keep hearing this described as a grumpy/sunshine pairing when it comes to the hero and heroine and unless I forgot what that means I’m pretty sure(actually, I would bet my life on it)that the hero Knox, was not grumpy, he was an absolute a$$hole, nothing less, nothing more. When someone acts rude, and downright verbally abusive to someone else for no reason whatsoever and keeps going back and forth with this attitude- again - for no reason whatsoever, that’s not a grumpy person - to me grumpy is maybe someone a little surly, a little rude, a little, blunt and a little impatient when it comes to general human interaction - and their attitude is not restricted to any one person in particular but rather everyone they encounter. The hero in this book had no reason to behave the way he did and I was just put off by him for most of the book. Also considering his age(I don’t like to say that someone should act a certain way according to their age - because God knows I’m the poster child for do Not act your age, but for a 40 something man to be so…. immature and irrational, it majorly put me off, no, thank you)•The heroine, I liked her, but I would have loved to see her more settled into her own and knowing exactly who she is and what she wants by the end of the book. She does make some decisions but I still feel like she lets the events that happened to her and the people in her life derail most of her individual and personal decisions.• the last point I’m gonna make but not necessarily the last thing that troubled me in this book, is that the heroine’s niece wasn’t given the proper story act that she needed. That was a child that was abandoned and she definitely had issues because of it - it’s just not possible otherwise and yet it felt like that whole situation was just used to give us an intro into the story but it wasn’t explored with the respect and dedication it needed to be. I actually would have loved to see that part play out, and I thought it was going to after reading the synopsis- but instead this veered into completely different grounds.So why did I give it 3 stars? Because I think it’s well written and it could be an overall a good time for most people, objectively, this wasn’t an awful book, it definitely wasn’t what I would consider a good story but the elements were there.In conclusion, I didn’t buy into the hype of this book. Do I get it? Yes, it does have a small town vibe, a hero who acts like an a$$ and a heroine who is trying her best and is a genuinely nice person. But is this worth the praises I’ve heard? Absolutely not. There are loads of books with this trope which have done it better and in less pages but are unfortunately not as popular.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '***4.5 STARS***This is my first book by Lucy Score but it will definitely not be my last.Naomi comes to the small town of Knockemout after leaving her fiancée at the alter and to come help her twin sister Tina.

Excellent storytelling, pacing, banter and dialogue. I loved Knox. He is the grumpy gorgeous hunk that has sworn off relationships and it is fun watching him fall. The only drawback I had was the length. It was a long book. But it kept my attention.I highly recommend it.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""— 3.5 stars ★“You make broken things whole again. Me. You made me whole. And every time you smile at me, I feel like I hit the lottery again.”Things We Never Got Overwas better than my expectations only because I went in with no expectations. I read it only for the fun and giggles and there were moments I was cringing so hard because how can you not when the characters in this book don't behave like adults?!This book was never in my 2024 book lists and it was a spontaneous decision to start this book and mostly it was because I wanted to see what all the hype is about. I jumped head first into the story and even loved the beginning and how the runaway bride Naomi Witt ended up being a guardian to an 11 year old kid. It was all trouble and chaos and I was really enjoying the banter and verbal sparring between Knox and Naomi. But this book did not needed 550+ pages! Everything was slow and there were too many useless small town moments with people's meddling. The whole thing could've been wrapped up in 400 pages max.The plot was interesting enough to keep me continue reading it. The story started off as an easy read with a few cringy and funny moments here and there. The story also went from hilarious to emotional and chaotic drama to criminal plot and everything was just too much for a normal small town romance story.Naomi and Waylay are the only main characters I actually liked.It was the bond between these two and how it grew stronger and stronger with each chapter. How Naomi did everything she could to help her niece and it was admirable because Naomi took her in without second guessing anything.➸ Naomi Witt:I liked her and her sarcasm was funny but not when she used it during sex. Naomi is the girl who hides behind the“I'm the good twin”façade and her life will go up in flames if she didn't had atleast a bucket full of coffee and if things didn't go according to her check-list.“There’s a difference between taking care of someone because you love them and taking care of someone because you want them to love you.”➸ Knox Morgan:Don't get me started on“Knox Morgan The Caveman”I am usually a sucker for grumpy x sunshine trope but Knox was an asshole type of grumpy and I get it was just who he was but the things he said to Naomi just because she wasn't his type of girl really annoyed me. His actions though are the literal opposites of what his words. He is protective of Waylay and Naomi and I liked it when he stepped up to help them with everything.“He was unfairly gorgeous. Too bad about the whole terrible personality thing.”➸ Waylay:She was the most mature and the smartest character in this book and that's saying something because most of the characters in this book are in their late 30s or early 40s!The romancewas cute and endearing at times and I liked the enemies to fake dating to lovers trope. I liked the contrasts between their personalities and their lives. I liked the back and forth between them as they fight their feelings and the foreshadowing about why that was. But they are also the most idiotic characters and especially Knox who broke up with Naomi for no reason. The third-act break up was so useless and it was just thrown in the book just for the sake of extra drama and to increase the length of this book. Also, I liked that he called her“Daisy”and the reason behind it was so sweet, but he also called her“Daze”which I guess is short for Daisy but that should be“Dais”right? I don't know why but that bothered me a lot in this book 😂“Why don’t you ever fucking listen?” he grumbled, lips moving against my hair.“Because sometimes people don’t know how to ask for what they really need. You needed a hug.”“No. I didn’t,” he rasped. He was quiet for a long moment, and I listened to his heartbeat. “I needed you.”➙ Things I liked:🌼 Found family trope🌼 Sunshine runaway bride and grumpy bad boy barber and the enemies to lovers trope🌼 Waylay the smartest kid and Waylon the cutest dog🌼 The horrible and catastrophic first meet-cute🌼 All Naomi and Waylay bonding moments🌼 The small town setting and it's gossips🌼 Naomi's supportive and loving parents🌼 Liza J the coolest granny🌼 The friendships where they will always have your back🌼 All the Luciane and Sloane crumbs! I am already obsessed with these two 🤭🌼 Epilogue and the bonus epilogue➙ Things I did not like:➾ The first spicy scene because Lucy ruined it with her fancy vocabulary like- “Professional ruiner of vaginas”- “magical wand that cast orgasm spells”- “A thick, purple-headed leader in the. world of erect penises”- “My tight, wet wonderland.”➾ Knox peeing in his backyard with his dog 😭 someone needs to tell Lucy and Knox that it's NOT normal for a man in his 40s!!➾ Knox's over the top territorial and caveman shit. I like that in quality in MMCs but Knox was just too much for me.➾ The useless love triangle between Naomi and Morgan brothers in the first half of the book➾ Pacing and the length of this book➾ The third-act breakup and the drama in the endI am invested in Knockemout and the other couple's stories especially Luciane and Sloane's story! Hopefully, they are better than this one.————————I'm starting this book with very low expectations bcs i have only read bad reviews for this book but the average rating tells another story 👀 so here goes nothing 🤞🏻""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'reaading vlog pronto en yt'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I saw a video saying this book was copaganda and suddenly everything makes more sense 💀Okay, so I really need to stop taking book recs from certain people.I don\'t even really want to talk about this book a lot, so I\'m just going to list what I didn\'t like:-How the days worked? She would wake up, have a giant ass cup of coffee, do one activity, be exhausted, go to sleep, and then it was the next day, BUT she would pick up the kid from the bus from the day before. I don\'t know if that made sense, but that\'s the thing, IT DIDN\'T MAKE SENSE. So basically, my explanation is perfect.-Coffee was this girl\'s ENTIRE personality for most of the book. I don\'t mind characters having an obsession with a food or drink, but when it\'s ALL they talk about, think about, or go get, it\'s ANNOYING.-This eleven-year-old was acting like a seventeen-year-old which I understand to a certain point since she kinda raised herself and was on her own, BUT the way she talked is what annoyed me the most. Kids can be more mature, but it should still show that they are a child through their speech mannerisms.-I didn\'t really like Knox. I don\'t really have anything to say about him. He didn\'t stand out, was bland, was an idiot (LIKE FRL), and pissed me off.-The ""climax"" with the sister and her boyfriend was so unrealistic I was dying laughing. And not in a good way 💀-The pacing was not for me. It was very insta-lovey just without them admitting it. I didn\'t feel the tension the characters were apparently experiencing and that really just turns me off the book. IF I DON\'T FEEL THE TENSION, I DON\'T WANT IT :)-Finally, the repetition.

It was the perfect mix of fun, sweet, emotional, and just a bit suspenseful.Naomi and Knox have an interesting meet cute. When Naomi rolls into town with daisies in her hair she doesn’t expect the welcome she gets. See, her twin sister who is basically a menace to the town, asks for her help. When Naomi shows, she is, of course, mistaken for the twin. That lasts for a bit but ultimately she carves her own place out in town, along with her niece who she’s taking care of.Naomi was fantastic and warmed up to everyone fast, aside from Knox. I loved their banter and even when they were back and forth you could tell they both had it bad for one another. I loved seeing them fall for one another. Knox was fantastic as well.This was one of those books I didn’t want to stop listening to. It was 16 hours long and I listened to it in a day and a half! If you’re a fan of Kristen Ashley’s older books (think the CM series) this book gave off those same vibes. The story was different, but it gave me the same kind of feelings, as well as having epic secondary characters.

I’m telling you that I’ll support you, even if what you decide to do is dangerous.”And this kind of settles in which direction this third book is heading. If you’re already familiar with Percy Jackson (which I’m pretty certain you are, because otherwise you wouldn’t read this review, right? *lol*) you know that the first two books were fun and had a lot of jokes in them. The third one? Not so much. Whilst it’s true that“The Titan’s Curse”was very entertaining and full of Uncle Rick’s trademark adventures I still have to point out that it was way more serious than its predecessors.”It’s cool. No sword. See? No sword. Calm thoughts. Sea grass. Mama cows. Vegetarianism.”Yes, we still have Percy’s funny remarks but just like the Harry Potter series this series is growing as well. The characters get older and their quests get more dangerous and grim. The stakes are higher and our characters are forced to realize that not everyone can be saved by a hero. For instance we’re barely a few chapters into the book when Annabeth disappears with the enemy. There’s no trace of her left and for all they know she even might be dead. Not that Percy would consider such an outcome! He has to save Annabeth because he just knows that she’s still alive! ;-) So what to do when you’re stranded on a cliff? Right, you call for the sun gods help to hitch a ride. XD”Wow,” Thalia muttered. “Apollo is hot.”“He’s the sun god,” I said.“That’s not what I meant.”I totally agree with Thalia btw! *lol* I loved that Apollo was a recurring part of this book and I can’t wait to read his series! He seems to be such a fun guy and I was more than just intrigued by his character. <3 Artemis and her Hunters were a great addition to the cast as well, and the Di Angelo twins? I think we’ll read more about them in future books! ;-) I’m really looking forward to this because I already like little Nico and took him to my heart! The true star of this story is Bessie the cow serpent though and if you don’t know who that is you better read the book and find out! *lol*”This is why I don’t use mortals,” Luke said. “They are unreliable.”“They are weak-minded, easily bought, and violent,” the General said. “I love them.”But of course there need to be real enemies in“The Titan’s Curse”as well and this time around they are pretty decent and smart. Next to Luke we have to face the General and this adversary is as dangerous and cunning as they come. Knowing my myths I wasn’t surprised about the story behind the man, but as a kid I probably would have been shocked. *lol*I mean the book is named “The Titan’s Curse” and Annabeth and Artemis have to hold up a mountain. Does this ring a bell? If you paid attention at school you must have figured out that the General is Atlas so that big revelation didn’t hit me as hard as it would have when I was younger. Who knew education could take away some of your enjoyment? *lol*Anyway, there was a short appearance of a character that helped Percy and I’ve to admit that I’m pretty curious about Rachel Elizabeth Dare. I can’t help but wonder if she’ll make an appearance in later books. The way she was introduced seemed to be very significant and Uncle Rick usually has a reason if he does things like that so… yeah. ;-P”Seven hundred feet tall,” I said. “Built in the 1930s.”“Five million cubic acres of water,” Thalia said.Grover sighed. “Largest construction project in the United States.”Zoe stared at us. “How do you know all that?”“Annabeth,” I said. “She liked architecture.”“She was nuts about monuments,” Thalia said.“Spouted facts all the time.” Grover sniffled. “So annoying.”“I wish she were here,” I said.This moment was so great because it showed how much those characters love and care about each other even if they occasionally get on each other’s nerves. *lol* It made me sad that Annabeth wasn’t a big part of this story but considering the main plot it was okay that she only played a minor role. Let’s just hope she’ll play a bigger part in“The Battle of the Labyrinth”again. =) And last but not least I want to say how much I love Percy! XD”Fight us,” I said. “And let’s see.”“Have the gods taught you nothing? An immortal does not fight a mere mortal directly. It is beneath our dignity. I will have Luke crush you instead.”“So you’re another coward,” I said.Haha! Is it just me or is there actually no god he didn’t challenge already? XD No matter which goddess or god appears, Percy seems to be ready to fight them all and I love it! ;-P I think by now he’s so pissed that he just doesn’t care anymore. At this point he might even take them on for just looking at him the wrong way. *lol* I can’t help but wonder what this means for the next two books and I’m so ready to read“The Battle of the Labyrinth”!!! Next one, please! XD____________________________________Does this count as a Halloween read?I mean there are mythological monsters in it so I guess we can say“yes”? *lol*Either way I need to read this until October 21st because I’m not handing this back to the library until I know what happens in this book! I’ve been waiting for“The Titan’s Curse”to arrive for ages and now that I finally got it someone else already pre-ordered it again. >_<Ahh Percy Jackson why are you so popular?!

We get lots of Thalia (Zeus' daughter), a fair dose of Grover (a Pan-hunting satyr), and a lot of Zoe Nightshade (one of Artemis' hunting posse).A lot of the book is spent travelling by varied means from one side of the States to the other, a journey punctuated by encounters with monsters.

You do not know when it is time to cut your losses. To save a friend, you would sacrifice the world. In a hero of the prophecy, that is very, very dangerous.”Imagine your biggest flaw is that you’re too loyal to your friends and would sacrifice yourself if it meant saving them.I could never be as humble as Percy.I’m still pinching myself over not having read this series before. I remember some mutuals I had here in 2016 were startingThe Hidden Oracle, and I had been set on starting the series. I don’t know what stopped me. However, I still appreciate being in my 20s and starting this now because following along the journey at this time, without worrying about books not being published yet, is relieving. Every time I’ve turned the last page of the previous books I’ve read from this series, I’m already picking up the next book. I don’t know how some of y’all read this when you were younger and kept up with all the characters and plots cause I keep needing to remind myself who is who.Still,The Titan’s Cursehad whatThe Sea of Monstersdidn’t: humor. I felt like Percy and the rest of the gang didn’t have their authentic voice in the previous book. But here, even though this story is more serious in every way, the author still manages to add sprinkles of humor and lightheartedness to show the intended audience of this story. The characters are still kids, and to me, a middle-grade novel needs to show their personalities that way. Percy is now 14, but he still has a brain developing, insecurities take over, and he makes unintentional bad decisions. Yet, we can’t help but root for him as he tries his best to save those closest to him, all while causing ruckus and havoc everywhere he goes. He’s fun, adventurous, optimistic, and a kid at heart with wit, joy, and a free spirit. I love his courageous attitude and how he’s growing into a strong young man willing to do anything to save the world. I love his determinant nature, never backing down and without a fight. I love his loving heart and how he still craves his father’s praise. I love his growing wisdom, resilience, and brave little soul. I love him and am sad about his willingness to give up for those who don’t appreciate him enough. I don’t know if this is the saddest installment of this series or what, but shoutout to Rick Riordan for making me feel sad over this 14-year-old demigod.And while the lightheartedness of the book is still relevant, the book does become more serious. Percy and his friends know the quests are becoming more serious, venturing closer to a potential and future war between the Titans and the Olympians. With the prophecy of one of the children from the three gods holding the world in their hands becoming closer and closer, the people await more clues as their futures will become reality. It becomes more difficult for them to follow along, and as they get older, their lives become more heavy. Annabeth spends most of the time out of the book because of a fight, and Percy is set on saving her. We meet many more new people, as well as continue seeing old faces, good and bad: Thalia, Zeus’s daughter, who we learned about in book 1; Luke and his growing army of bringing back Kronos; Nico and Bianca di Angelo, who we learn are Hades’ children, who he had with a mortal woman before the Oath was made; the Goddess of Hunt, Artemis, as well one of her best Hunter’s, Zoë Nightshade; the Goddess of Beauty, Aphrodite; the God of the Sun, Apollo. We have our usual God of Wine, Dionysus, who I sometimes want to slap in the face, and other times, I can’t help but sigh because of how relatable he is. There is also Rachel, who I am curious about and hope to meet again in the rest of the series. The author continues to excel in creating a fascinating but entirely fun cast of characters. Full of trust, love, betrayals, and friendship, we continue finding more secrets with the kids. It isn’t as whimsical as other books in this genre, but the stories have still provided entertainment, creating a world full of different twists that you will spot early on if you’re familiar with Greek mythology. However, the author adds his twists to it, making the read easy to follow, read, and analyze. With journey after journey, there is not a single moment of silence the characters have, yet we, as the readers, appreciate this as there is also something about to happen.With that being said, I do wish we could have had a little more backstory on Thalia’s return.The Sea of Monstersended with her introducing herself as the daughter of Zeus, yet when we open this story up, we’re suddenly thrown into her, Percy and Annabeth getting a ride from Sally Jackson, Percy’s mother, to Camp Half-Blood. There was no explanation of how Thalia’s return was taken, which made the timeline a little rusty. I would have appreciated some explanation to see how everyone took this to get a better understanding of her friendship with everyone. I also can’t lie and say that I was a big fan of her because she aggravated me a few times. My heart has been breaking for Percy since the first book, with how he was bullied by Clarrise and her goons, as well as Nancy and her minions. Then he tries his best to save one of his best friends, and along the way, he’s continuously insulted by Thalia and Zoë. To an extent, I understand where they were coming from, but other times, I wish they could have taken a chill pill. Too serious for my liking, not trustworthy enough, and hesitant. They both had a sort of leadership to them that was probably supposed to show them off as diligent and robust, but I couldn’t bring myself always to care. My heart stands with Percy, always.I am growing to love these characters more and more. With the Second Titan War approaching (it’s obvious), I can’t help but feel nothing but anticipation. Seeing these kids grow up in their way has been exciting to witness. Every scene gives a new, promising future, showing the growing potential of all the characters. I’ve also adored seeing how their feelings grow. I’m sure we’re all aware of Percy and Annabeth becoming a couple in the future, and it’s delightful to see the small things in their friendship. Not to mention, Grover has shown himself to be a trustworthy friend, someone Percy can rely on. I can’t wait to see how The Battle of the Labyrinth goes!“The most dangerous flaws are those which are good in moderation,” she said. “Evil is easy to fight. Lack of wisdom…that is very hard indeed.”'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I have yet to be disappointed in this series. A real rarity in a fantasy series in general.The story starts out with Percy, Annabeth, and Thalia trying to help Grover to sneak out two half-bloods from a private military style school. Things get immediately messy and they stumble upon yet another problem, or more like a crisis. In the process of a battle Annabeth is stolen away. Something called The General is out again wrecking havoc and as you can already tell Luke has a hand in all this. This time around though you see Luke for what he really is, a kid trying to play with the big boys.We get to see the goddess Artemis and her huntresses. Quite an intriguing bunch, eternal life if you don't fall in love? Kind of harsh, but I guess the price you pay matches your reward. The second in command of the huntresses, Zoe, would have to be my favorite new character. She's prickly but you learn throughout the book why she is the way she is. Bianca and Nico are the new half-bloods and will prove to play important roles in how the plot moves along.It never fails to impress me how the author can intricately put everything into these books. I never feel bored and I love the view he takes on different mythology stories. After reading this book I'll never look at Hercules the same. One of my biggest enjoyments is seeing different American landmarks mentioned in the story, and seeing their odd connection to the Greek myths. You can tell the books are going to take a bit of a darker turn. It makes sense since they all are getting older and the inevitable prophecy is looming over.Always funny, fast-paced, and having hidden fountains of mysteries.

My first year in university has started since Monday and I have been pretty busy with tasks lately but I\'m enjoying my college life! ( so far ) it\'s so much fun!I\'m writing this review on my phone so I will add gifs and the quotes from the book later because I don\'t have the book with me right now.What I didn\'t like💔 To be honest, the whole thing about saving mission is pretty cliché. In the first book, Percy saved her mom, in the second book, Percy saved Grover and in this book, Percy saved Annabeth and it\'s pretty cliché, you know. now I\'m wondering what will happen in the fourth book? I\'m hoping it won\'t be like this anymore. I\'m not saying I didn\'t enjoy this book, I did enjoy this book but I just got a little bit bored with this whole saving mission. I just want the three of them together!! Percy, Annabeth and Grover. That\'s all. Just like the first book.My Opinion⭐️ Did I ever tell you how I love the writing style of this series?? The writing style is SO good! It\'s really funny and the writing style is the first reason I enjoy reading this book. Like how could the author writethisperfection?? Seriously, the writing style is so perfect.The wind blowing through my ripped clothes was socold that I felt like a Percysicle.⭐️ NICO DI ANGELO. Look, I\'m the last children in my family, so I have always wanted to have a little sister or a little brother and OH MY GOD! NICO IS SO DAMN CUTE! I want him to be my little brother andhe needs to be protected at all costand OH MY GOD. at first I couldn\'t even guessing who his godly parent was but then when I was half way through the book or nearing the ending, I just had this thought that he might be the son of Hades and I WAS RIGHT and my heart was breaking for him. look, at first, I didn\'t even believe that Biance died. I just thought that she would somehow survive but then I realized that she died ... and my heart was breaking for Nico. I have a big sister who I love so much and just the thought of losing her scared me so much.⭐️ THIS BOOK WAS SO HILARIOUS. I laughed so much at this sceneGrover blushed. ""I was sort of camped outside theArtemis cabin.""""What for?""""Just to be, you know, near them.""""You\'re a stalker with hooves.""and they continued talking but I just had to stop reading for a moment because I was laughing so hard. Thankfully, I didn\'t read that scene in public otherwise I might got funny looks from my friends or anyone but I kind of thought that Grover was kind of strange, you know. why would he camp outside the Artemis cabin? and the reason was just that he wanted to be near them? LOL. Grover is so funny, I like him so much.⭐️ my eyes got a little bit teary when Zoë died. Why did she have to die?! Zoë was an interesting character and I wanted to read more about her but she died. why do this always happen to me? every time I started liking certain characters, they either get hurt or die. why have I done to deserve this kind of torment???????""Let the world honor you, my Huntress,"" Artemis said.""Live forever in the stars.""shit. My eyes are teary again right now. Okay, bye guys, I\'m going to go and enjoy this pain.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~REVIEW TO COME TOMORROW.

Obvious, it offers mythology with its own twist, but it's also informative towards the original stories. Even when things differ for the sake of Percy's adventures there's usually an excuse given in the storytelling.Jam packed with action and sword fights and memorable villains I feel like had I read this as a kid I would have been obsessed with it, right along with Harry Potter.I had small issues with this book that brought down my rating a little.Firstly, this one definitely suffers from middle child syndrome. By this point in the series we know the stakes. We know that Percy's going to end up on an adventure that takes him outside Camp Halfblood, and we know that the end goal is seeing him reach his 16th birthday when prophecies abound.This offering in the series raises the stakes in small ways, but in others I felt like it was sort of... useless fluff.There are a few new characters introduced in this outing. One of which get unceremoniously dumped from the plot fairly quickly in terms of the entire series - unless they make a surprise return in later books that is - \xa0and the other I'm sure will be expanded on in books 4 and 5, but here these characters felt almost totally useless. Even the one that might someday return felt wasted. Like they're there one moment and then dumped when the plot called for it.Oh, and the Hunters. Artemis has these immortal hunters that follow her around like lackeys, and while I love that idea,I wasn't in love with how blase some characters were about joining her band, when joining means leaving behind your mortality and everyone you've ever known to join a goddess.Although that does sound really awesome.Other than those two tiny things, I really enjoyed the story and am excited to see where it goes next! I think a lot of things from this book will likely come up again and become important, so I'm happy to give this 4 out of 5 stars.★★★★ =4/5 stars!""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Another 5 stars book from Riordan. Are you really surprised!?There seems to be a recurring theme with me and my favorite series. I always wait years before giving them a try and after that I kick myself for not doing it sooner. I did that with Harry Potter, then with Tunnels (by Roderick Gordon and Brian Williams), then with Eragon, then with Robert Langdon. Even with The Lord of the Rings. Not one of my favorites was read ‘on time’.And Percy Jackson shares a lot of similarities with those books, especially Harry Potter. I said this before in a review, I think, but the main themes explored by the books are the same: friendship and family, courage and fortitude in dark times.And they both also share the beautiful fact that they have a great great, great villain. Seriously now, Luke is so damn great!The one thing that made me shake my fist like an old man was Annabeth missing for a large chunk of the book. It was a smart plot device for another adventure, but oh man, I missed her!But we have some new characters that grow on you as the book moves on, so don’t worry, Riordan and his jokes are in full force.Overall, it is a wild ride! And even though I think it might be my least favorite of the first series, it is still part of one of the best fantasy arcs I’ve ever read about.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Let me open by saying...Rick Riordan, I\'m sorry for what I\'m about to say. I\'m an unpublished writer and I know the best I can hope for is that at some point some will like what I write, and some will well, rip it.I\'ve not been ""real complimentary\' of these books up to this point, I gave each 3 stars...said they were what I\'d call, ""not bad"". I dropped this one to 2 stars...it\'s getting to ""bad"".First, I must say apologetically that the writing isn\'t all that great. I know these have sold millions and we have the first movie in what I know a lot of people hope will be a series. I can\'t account for people\'s taste, I mean look at Gilligan\'s Island. Reading these books I must say that somewhere there\'s probably a toddler with a parent reading them to him/her who is thinking something like, ""Percy is just now getting that? I figured it out 5 chapters ago"". Percy Jackson is without a doubt as dense as a locust fence post. The kid is written so thick I\'m surprised he can get his shoes on. I\'d never have trusted this kid with a butter knife, much less a magic sword (of course luckily it won\'t hurt ""mortals"" only ""immortals\' as it\'s made of celestial bronze. This must be an odd kind of bronze as I know all bronze I\'ve come in contact with is pretty much as solid as any other metal.).Aside from the usual problem of Percy being so frustratingly (your going to see that word or it\'s root ""frustrate"" a few times in this review) thick this book manages to go to new heights in it\'s efforts to drive readers into banging their heads into walls. Without giving a spoiler, there is another regular character in the books who has been sort of the ""counter-point"" to Percy\'s inability to understand the most elementary event. Her character has been fairly well established. SO, to set up the action in this book the author has her do something so frustratingly (yes, there\'s the word) stupid and against character that I knew things weren\'t going to go well. Yes, I got what was supposed to be the reason in/for the act...but she\'d never have acted so stupidly, not the girl we met in the first 2 books.There are other problems here that were smaller in the first two books but apparently like wounds left untended have festered and are now overpowering the rest of the story. His playing fast and loose with history and myth are getting beyond my tolerance. He managed to turn Artemis the hunter into a sort of female Peter Pan and her huntresses into a girls club of ""lost girls"" instead of ""lost boys"" stuck at that age where little boys go ""yuck girls"" and little girls go ""yuck boys"". I could almost hear them singing...."" I won\'t grow up, I won\'t grow up...I don\'t want to go to school, I don\'t want to go to school...."" Need I say any more, maybe the story\'s take on Hercules? Maybe more of the incorrect slant given to the Greek Pantheon?If ignorance was contagious or misinformation was infectious this book would be banned by the CDC.I\'ve been treating these books as YA books. They are so frustratingly simplistic I think I need to think of them more as juvenile level reads and go from there. I got them from the library and the next 2 are laying here (the second through the 5th came in together). Were I buying these I\'d probably have stopped earlier, this one would bring me even closer to it. Were my kids still small and had they gotten into these I\'d definitely go over anything they were picking up from them book by book.On the positive side (I need to say something positive) the books do manage to show the pettiness and selfishness that was so prevalent in the character of the deities and heroes of Greek myth. It fails in filling that out, but it is there.I live in hope that the next book won\'t frustrate me as badly as this one has. ""Where there\'s life there\'s hope"" as the old saying goes...and I keep hoping. I\'ll drop this volume to 2 stars and hope the next is better.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""4.5/5SO glad that I'm continuing on with this series!

Is this useful to anyone? No, probably not, but I feel like writing it down, so I might as well share:-Am I in the minority when I say Zoë was the star of this book? Because if I am, that would be shameful! She was so brave and so fierce and so loyal. She was completely ready to sacrifice herself; her tragically heroic story really brought out some feelings in me.Not to mention, her character was just so genuinely and deeply interesting to me. She had a backstory filled with betrayal, grief and a need for revenge, but she also grew in this story and learned to trust and admire people she would have sneered at on instinct.Lastly, she cracked me up too. She acted so high-and-mighty and her uptight, old-fashioned attitude was oddly charming and funny to me. I just really liked her. A lot.-Artemis was iconic and was showing some serious queen behaviour. She was just so righteous and noble and ready to fight for the world. She was the only god who truly seemed to care about the people around her and even about the innocents she does not personally know. I would love to know more about her and all the other girls in the Hunt.-Percy, of course, was still a good guy. Childhood me remembers him as being more goofy and sarcastic though, but so far, he’s just… well, a good guy. Nothing super special. Which is odd, cus I could have sworn he was one of the most charming and funniest book characters I know… but I’m not really seeing that yet. I still really like him! I just don’t really love him with a deep passion or anything like that.-Annabeth was hardly in this story, but somehow I found her surprisingly annoying; the fact that she considered joining the Hunters, meaning she would choose to never see Percy again, just irked me in all the wrong ways and the fact that she still kept on defending and mooning over Luke got on my nerves as well.-I’m not a Thalia fan. At all. She is so rude and hostile for no reason to Percy (and to most people in general, to be honest) and the fact that she was so close to being tempted to basically ruin the world?? Um, that doesn’t sound like a very good person to me. Thank you, next.-I liked Bianca. But well. Much good that did me…-Grover was… there. He doesn’t have much of a personality these days besideslovingnature, stalking the Hunters (in such a creepy way; what’s up with that?), and obsessing over Pan. I was pretty shocked at how little he seemed to care about Annabeth’s disappearance and possible death. I would have assumed he’d feel some type of emotion about that, but no. I guess not.-I know Rachel was only in this for like 0.1 seconds, but I loved her?? I vaguely remember her being someone a lot of readers dislike, but I’m not sure why because she seemed really funny to me here. Very mouthy and sarcastic and just overall like a breath of fresh air. I can’t wait to see more of her.-I MISSED MY BABY TYSON SO MUCH!!!!'Percy Jackson and the Olympians' series:1.The Lightning Thief- 3.5 stars2.The Sea of Monsters- 3.0 stars3.

You can go back to pretending you don't like me, and I can pretend that I don't care.

To be honest, I wish there were more female characters I would want to root for or know more about. Evangeline though was very nice and I found I wasn't annoyed by her inner voice as this book is from her POV and more often than not female characters get on my nerves.Evangeline was an easygoing character whose adventure I enjoyed following along with her.All in all, I can't really empathize how much i want to get my hands on book 3.Time machine?

(major spoilers →i adored apollo\'s character and felt bad for him UP UNTIL A POINT MY GOD I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT ENDING HE STOLE ALL OF EVANGELINE\'S MEMORIES AND THEN HAD THAT FAKE SMILE ON 😃 like i know the price for jacks turning back time to save evangeline was her losing her memories of him (which i still cannot get over i was about to cry) but the fact that he was smiling and acting like everything was alright??? confusion 101. ALSO NOT CHAOS KILLING EVANGELINE🤡🤡 it was an accident but still😭) thank god marisol was barely in here.i literally cannot get enough of jacks and evangeline. their moments <33 the bantering, the soft moments, AND SO MANY TROPES I NEVER KNEW I NEEDED BTWN THEM THAT I GOT SKHGSK LITERALLY WAS SCREAMING. and for a situation where jacks cant kiss anyone bc theyll die, the romance was📈📈i just need to share my favourite moments btwn them so dont click on this if you dont want to get spoiled:""Do you kiss the prince because you actually enjoy it?"" Jacks asked. ""Or is it because you honestly think it will magically revive him?""""Maybe I do it because I know it will annoy you,"" Evangeline answered archly.Jacks flashed a smile that was far more wicked than welcoming. ""Glad to know you\'re thinking about me when you kiss your husband.""I DIED HERE THE COMEBACK WAS SO SMOOTH HELPand the moment where the""gentle hands instead of harsh ones wrapped protectively around her""and jacks getting angry for evangeline🥺 literally the LOVE there. i love how evangeline felt safe and content in jacks arms always my god i cant with these two.""Everything was fuzzy and distant, but she knew, somehow, that these arms held her closer than the hot arms ever had.""THERE WERE EVEN TWO SCENES WHERE EVANGELINE IS HURT AND JACKS IS THERE RIGHT AWAY TO SAVE HER. and one of those scene was golden, jacks himself nursed her back to health🥹 the softness in jack was so sweet and everything help. literally this was so adorable, seeing this side of jacks:“You’re so good at this” she murmured. “Do you often travel with girls who’ve been flayed?”This earned her a soft laugh. “No.” Then quietly, as he ran a cloth along her lower back, just below the dip in her waist, “would you be jealous if I did?”I’m not a jealous person was what Evangeline intended to say, but instead the words “Of course” came out.Jacks laughed, louder this time.Embarrassment surged through her. ""That\'s not what I meant to say.""""It\'s all right. I\'d probably kill another man if I found him with you like this""SDKJFGKSHS I LOVE THEM STOPoh oh and then also jacks jumping off a cliff with evangeline and dragging her out of the ocean stubbornly saying""I will not let you die"", this boy is so obviously in love. he\'s so protective of her, the way he panics seeing evangeline hurt""I know, love. I\'m going to take you somewhere safe.""HE CALLED HER ""LOVE"" JACKS CALLED EVANGELINE LOVE I WAS SCREAMING AND STILL AM SDJGHKSHG[Evangeline] ""Do you still think of me as just a tool?""Jacks frowned. ""I try not to think of you at all.""i-🥹🥹🥹Jacks\'s chest was heaving, his clothes were soaked, his hair was a mess across his face--yet in that moment, Evangeline knew he would carry her through more than just freezing waters.

She’d let him crush her, let him break her, just as long as he never let her go. This was what she wanted, and she refused to believe that he didn’t want it, too.""seeing this after the end hurts more than i ever couldve imagined i really will never be okay what happened to the happy moments ???no because i literally have 5 pages of notes on a word doc, i could go on forever but im going to stop before i start crying again.and i just need to share some of my other favourite quotes these were so beautiful:""The secret to staying in love is having someone who will catch you when you start to fall out of it. And I promise to always catch you.""""Happy endings can be caught, but they are difficult to hold on to. They are dreams that want to escape the night. They are treasure with wings.. They are wild, feral, reckless things that need to be constantly chased, or they will certainly run away.""""She used to think love was like a house. Once it was built, a person got to live in it forever. But now she wondered if love was more like a war with new foes constantly appearing and battles creeping up. Winning at love was less about succeeding in a battle and more about continuing a fight, to choose the person you loved as the one you were willing to die for, over and over.""AND THEN THESE TWO HAD TO GO AND DESTROY ME😃That is not a small mistake to fix. If you do this, Time will take something equally valuable from you.""""There is nothing of equal value to me.""HAHAHA STOP IM GOING TO CRY HE SAID IT HIMSELF.

I\'d ask other characters to donate braincells to her but the other lot isn\'t much smarter and they definitely don\'t have braincells to spare.all Evangeline cares about is having a love story. and she acts like she\'s having two while in reality she has none.Jacks shouldn\'t touch her because she\'s married to Apollo - a man she has interacted with for two seconds. But at the same time she thinks she can save Jacks by telling him she loves him.girlie, he won\'t care.not only do you have no chemistry with him, thinking""hihi if i just tell him i love him everything will be fine""is dripping with naivety. she truly doesn\'t understand any of the problems and motivations of the other characters. why is she the main one. the perspective of a random tree would have achieved the same thing.TL;DR:they should rebrand this book and target it to toddlers who don\'t have object permanence yet. i think that\'s about the same developmental level Evangeline is at. 1 star.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'HAPPY PUBLICATION DAY, BALLADWhen I first got the email that my owlcrate edition of this book was going to be delivered 3 days early on September 10th, I thought it was a blessing. Not only was it my day off but this book was my most anticipated read of the year!! Then, at 1 am that next morning, it felt more like a curse. Which is actually the theme here so it kind of makes sense.And now, 3 days later, I’m STILL suffering from such intense heartbreak that I don’t know if I should rate this book 1 star, or 5 stars (I’m rating it 5 of course)⚠️This review will contain MAJOR spoilers so proceed with caution…⚠️This book started right where Once Upon a Broken Heart (which I will be referring to as ouabh from now on) left off. Evangeline is writing a letter to herself, warning her not to trust jacks again. She goes on about even though he’s cute as fck, it doesn’t matter. THEN she writes”Remember that he was the one to poison Apollo so that he could frame you for murder in order to make a long lost prophecy come true-one that would turn you into a key capable of opening the Valory Arch. That is all he wants, to open the Valory Arch.”So basically, I want to talk about this first because I think it’s one of the most important parts of Jacks and Evangeline’s relationship. So since the start, in ouabh and in most of Ballad, Jacks makes it clear that the only reason he keeps saving Evangeline from dying all these different times is because he needs her as the key. He says it, she says it, everyone says it. And it’s like ok, that makes sense. BUT THEN…When Jacks takes Evangeline to the hollow and she has the youth stone and the youth stone also makes people tell the truth. Jacks doesn’t know she has it and he admits that he doesn’t even want to open the Valory arch. HE DOESNT EVEN WANT TO OPEN THE VALORY ARCH!!!All he wants are the four stones needed to open if which he didn’t even need Evangeline to help him find them. Which leads me to my next point. Jacks cursed Apollo. And I know it doesn’t really make sense as to why he would have cursed him if he doesn’t even want to open the arch, but I think he new Apollo is a bad person and will hurt Evangeline. (Because Apollo steals all of her memories at the end of the book and makes her forget everything, I will get to that later). But I don’t really know if that would make sense because the cure for Apollos curse is In the Valory Arch.It’s all so confusing to me and all my emotions are so conflicted but I think it’s very important that Jacks was actually keeping Evangeline alive all those times because he LOVES HER. DUH.ONTO MY FAVORITE EVAJACKS MOMENTSIn ouabh we had like minor angst and then the crypt scene phew. But I had to put Ballad down multiple times just to process the tension oh my god. So many butterflies for them 😭This part of the book was literally life changing for me”Evangeline—“ Jacks’s low voice sounded distant, but he must have been there because she could feel him. She could feel the cool of his arms siding gently under her legs and carefully under her neck as he cradled her to his chest.“It hurts, jacks.”“I know, love. I’m going to take you somewhere safe.”Oh my god, he literally just called her LOVE ??? I literally died and came back to lifeAnd then there’s just the entire part where they’re at the hollow together, I wish I could put that entire section in this review because it’s fucking everything.Also this part.”I mean… it’s just for one night,” he said softly. “In the morning, you can forget it. You can go back to pretending you don’t like me, and I can pretend that I don’t care. But for tonight, let me pretend you’re mine.”Keep in mind, JACKS said that to Evangeline. 😭😭😭Now…As I drew near the end of the book, I could feel my grip on this happily ever slipping. I will literally start crying as I describe how saddened I was by this ending. After Jacks uses the four stones to go back in time and save Evangeline from chaos, it is then IMPLIED that he sacrifices himself in her place. I feel like this could definitely be and opening for a third book because I just feel like after everything Jacks has been through, and how much is readers love him. He death cannot be so… not there.Also there was never a body soooo….But the very end, like the last chapter and then the EPILOGUE. Ruined me. Literally fuck Apollo, I fucking hate him. Which is another reason I think there could be a third book, because what the fuck??? Since when can Apollo just fucking pull memories out of peoples heads?? There has to be some explaining there. And also if left in such a cliff hanger??But also part of me thinks, this is just a tragedy, and maybe it is. Because my heart is most definitely broken and maybe it just has to stay that way.I shall finish off my rant here, I should probably talk a little about the story and writing now.As always, I love Stephanie Garbers writing. It is TRULY magical. I devoured this book all in one sitting and it’s a world I most definitely would love to visit.The story itself was nothing too complicated, I loved the story of the archer and the fox and how it ties in. I loved Lucs character. His and Evangeline’s relationship is just proof that exes can have healthy friendships after. Even if one of them is a vampire 😏I will probably come back and edit this review at some point, or maybe not. It’s very ranty but I must go drown my sorrows in a bottle now and make an Evajacks playlist on Spotify that hopefully I can link on here later.————————————————————————UPDATEI have no idea if this is a duology, I just always assumed so because of the title but it’s probably not————————————————————————First reviewMorning after reading this and I’m suffering from such intense heartbreak, I can’t focus on anything else.

I’m going to take you somewhere safe.”Evangeline & Jacks. Jacks & Evangeline. they had me on a constant paroxysmal cathartic state of emotions. i oscillated between hurt in how easily everyone fractured Evangeline’s pure trust; happy in the flourishing camaraderie and developing love they retained so preciously concealed; angry with every unveiling key secret that Jacks kept from Evangeline, enraged that Donatella was still ponding on Jacks and this series akin to a sword of Damocles; desperate for the ending to be a subterfuge; i even admired the arrangements and brillant writing ornamenting the last chapters. but i believe that the one and only bright parcelle of the ending was how it converged with Jacks breathing the personification of selfless, just because of Evangeline, just for her.and that what translates into a veritable true love..“I wish our story could have had another ending.”(now i’m going to retire to that dark corner on my room to sob a little more while waiting for the 3rd copie to arrive and admiring my fav quotes.)“he held her with the type of intensity that only happens when a person wants something that isn't quite theirs.”“it didn't matter if he stayed forever cursed.

Now, I didn\'t really cry this time but I just sat there and stared at the book in shock because I\'d TOTALLY forgotten how this book ended, and I remember so vividly why I was so annoyed that it would take ""so long"" to get the next book, and yet here we are, and the next book is sitting on my desk.I\'m ngl, I kinda got mad when Evangline admitted she loves Jacks 😭 I think I\'m mentally ill, because it\'s either that I\'mjealousof a fucking fictional character, or I\'m sad that the enemies to lovers is over. I\'m pretty sure it\'s both.I just reread my initial review and I\'m confused because I called Chaos a horrible villain when he didn\'t even do anything bad 😭 like that thing at the end wasn\'t even really his fault, so I like him.Also, fuck Apollo. I forgot how much I hate that guy.Also again I\'m pretty sure this book reminded me how much I love reading, since I\'ve been in a terrible book drought lately ❤<><><><><><><><><>1st read:“In the morning, you can forget it. You can go back to pretending you don\'t like me, and I can pretend that I don\'t care. But for tonight, let me pretend you\'re mine.”All I feel is pain.So yeah. I\'m not okay right now. I knew the ending would kill me based off of reviews and people literally telling me that they cried and yes:I cried.But we\'ll have the ending\'s own section at the end, so let\'s first talk about...THE PLOTAlso, huge thank you tojoy (elend\'s version)for giving me a summary on the first book! If you hadn\'t, I wouldn\'t have remembered anything!Oh. My God. So, if you all were seeing some of my status updates popping up (and there were a lot of them) then you know that I was freaking out literally all of the way through. Miss Garber was feeding us those plot twists. I was squealing, gasping, screaming, and giggling after almost each chapter because HOLY PLOT TWISTS. There was literally never a dull moment in this book, it was either really tense or funny, and I L O V E D it.I literally predicted none of the plot twists except maybe one:Jacks was the Archer. It seemed really obvious that Jacks was the Archer to meI love a good book that just keeps bringing in the plot twists. I was reading out in public and I literally had to resist gawking at the book and looking like an idiot because a twist was just revealed.Anyways, this plot was amazing, incredible, splendid, magical, and a bunch of other words alike to those.AND THEN WE HAVE...THE CHARACTERSI want to be like Evangeline Fox. I love her so much. So, in the beginning when I was getting used to the characters again, I didn\'t like her at first (probably because I wanted Jacks all to myself but we don\'t talk about my unhealthy attachment to fictional characters okay-) but she is an amazing protagonist. She actually makes semi-rational decisions, but she also was apparently really dumb according to my updates where I said she was dumb like twice. So yes, she did some stupid things in this book, but everyone does, so I can\'t fault her. But oh my gosh, this girl has been THROUGH IT. So much stuff happens to her in this book and I feel so bad!“I wish our story could have had another ending.”Stop.Anyways, onto Jacks. My one true love. I know, he\'s manipulative, cruel, only cares about himself, but do I care?No.Jacks could turn me into one of those vampires any day, I don\'t care. Sure, he makes ahem *questionable* choices throughout this book, but they were all because he cared about Evangeline. Maybe. At least I HOPE so. Jacks better not be pulling an ""I didn\'t actually care for you"" thing. I will die if he does.Here are some gems from the Prince of Hearts\'s mouth:“It\'s all right. I\'d probably kill another man if I found him with you like this.”I\'m not okay.“Where were you?” she asked.“I was killing innocent maidens and kicking puppies.”“Jacks, that’s not funny.”Comedic legend.“I do not want you dead, and I’ll kill anyone who tries.”We love an overprotective prince.So, if you can\'t tell already, I\'ve got an unhealthy obsession. And to be quite honest?I like him more than Legend.YES, I SAID IT.10/10“Dark was for stars and dreams and the magic that took place in between days.”All of these side characters were great too:-We learn so much about LaLa and that she\'s no ordinary Fate. I was actually shocked when her plot twists came in.-Chaos is a great villain. I was genuinely awed and horrified by his actions and all of these things he did to Evangeline were awful.-Apollo can fall off a cliff-Why does Luc just keep randomly appearing just to try to bite Evangeline?If there are any other side characters that I\'ve forgotten, that must mean they aren\'t important.AND THAT FINALLY BRINGS US TO...EVAJACKS/THEIR IMPECCABLE TENSIONOh my gosh. Practically all of their scenes were FULL of tension and it was literally eating me from the inside out. Miss Garber definitely knows how to write tension. There were SO many different scenes where I thought they were going to kiss, and they made me absolutely insane. I was giggling an embarrassing amount IN PUBLIC. But yeah, Evangeline and Jacks turn me into an absolute monster and I\'m okay with that.“It hurts, Jacks.”“I know, love. I’m going to take you somewhere safe.”Excuse me-AND THEY DON\'T EVEN KISS IN THIS BOOK. WHY DID THE KISS SCENE HAVE TO BE BETWEEN APOLLO AND EVANGELINE, THAT KISS WAS HOT. JUST PUT JACKS IN THE PLACE OF APOLLO*sigh* and then there\'s...the ending.Why. Just why. WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE THIS?? I HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG AND THEN YOU GIVE METHIS??When I read the final few chapters, my jaw was open, my eyes were watering, and I kept whispering, ""oh my god"" and ""no"" over and over. And then when it was all over and I\'d read the epilogue, I just stared at the wall, tears running down my face, and then silently marked this as read.THANK GOD THERE\'S A THIRD BOOK COMING BECAUSE WTF.Literally so much was going on with this ending, and I will never forget it.To all the people who warned me that I would cry, you were correct.“She wanted the pain to end. She wanted to forget his dimpled smile, his brilliant blue eyes, the way he called her Little Fox.”So yeah, this was my review of The Ballad of Never After. I\'ve not felt this strongly over a book in a while, so this was fun. So, um, excuse me while I just go and stare at the wall for another hour. Thank you.5 stars“Nothing has been safe since the moment I laid eyes on you.

The development in the storyline from there to here was sosignificantand the plot twists left me absolutely intrigued and hooked and I completelydevoured this.You can definitely expect more curses, more chaos, more Lala, newish characters, general character build up, and twists and turns in this.Evangeline and Jacks “relationship” evolved immeasurably here. I loved the progression in the emotional buildup and was LIVING for the fun banter/tension between them and the steamy crumbs we did get were painfully delicious. I was also kicking my feet up all throughout the book with those moments — even the vulnerable ones. the moments in the hollow were truly everything. I really want and need evajacks to get their HEA♥“I merely like the thought that I torment you as much as you torment me.""Evangelines growth and character development was so appreciated and loved here. But Eva, babes, not you calling jacks an apple-eating scoundrel at the start lol thankfully she wasn’t as trusting and more aware of everything that was going on.“Evangeline\'s hope had always burned brighter than her fear.”She’s still as hopeful with her heart despite everything that ensues but somehow wiser in her determination. It made me adore her sm more on a whole new level.Evangeline still believed that every story had the possibility for infinite endings, and she was going to find one of the good onesAs for Jacks, the absolute chokehold that man had on me omg. The loml in my head. I loved him even more after this and completely get the love all of you have for him.Whenever he had his moments with Eva, I just wanted to insert myself and tell him tok*llseduce me with his kiss already (how dramatic of me I know but idc mostly all of you thought the same haha).“It was a smile like a fairytale, part villain, part hero, part impossible ever after”The little that we did get of his backstory was helpful in understanding him. He was undoubtedly as ravishing as always and he was mostly everything I mentioned him to be in OUABH. But I stand corrected, he wasn’t as self serving here as he was in OUABH — instead his actions were extremelyselfless“He’d felt like a feral fairytale warrior, determined to do whatever it took to save her.”Jacks and his damn apples — has anyone counted how many he’s eaten?? It’s not further explained why but I think I know.“I know, love. I’m going to take you somewhere safe.”And we’re saying love now?? SCREAMING RN. I couldn’t get over that and it was one time. Please give us more StephanieAs for Apollo? Yeah he could eat alll of those cute words he said before up and obliterate himself with them for all I care.While the ending didn’t make me bawl my eyes out as I thought it would — trust that I was full of hurt and indignation like the rest of you. It was, in all, just exhilarating and immersive and the writing/storytelling just as enchanting (despite the chaos that occurred here) and Stephanie conveyed it all so wellThe release date couldn’t be any more farther for book 3 as I’m currently experiencing the only book hangover from it.once upon a broken heart reviewQuotes that stood out to me:“Happy endings can be caught, but they are difficult to hold on to. They are dreams that want to escape the night. They are treasure with wings. They are wild, feral, reckless things that need to be constantly chased, or they will certainly run away.”“Life is not a kind story teller. And I’m not meant to be a savior.”“I do not want you dead, and I’ll kill anyone who tries.”“Every prince gets cursed. A prince without a curse will be forgotten by history, and trust me when I say that Apollo wants to be remembered”“I hurt everyone, Little Fox.

Things We Lost in the Fire
",Mariana Enríquez,4.06,48101,1242,"Short Stories, Horror, Fiction, Magical Realism, Gothic, Contemporary, Spanish Literature",192,10-02-2016,"In these wildly imaginative, devilishly daring tales of the macabre, internationally bestselling author Mariana Enriquez brings contemporary Argentina to vibrant life as a place where shocking inequality, violence, and corruption are the law of the land, while military dictatorship and legions of desaparecidos loom large in the collective memory. In these stories, reminiscent of Shirley Jackson and Julio Cortázar, three young friends distract themselves with drugs and pain in the midst a government-enforced blackout; a girl with nothing to lose steps into an abandoned house and never comes back out; to protest a viral form of domestic violence, a group of women set themselves on fire.But alongside the black magic and disturbing disappearances, these stories are fueled by compassion for the frightened and the lost, ultimately bringing these characters—mothers and daughters, husbands and wives—into a surprisingly familiar reality. Written in hypnotic prose that gives grace to the grotesque, Things We Lost in the Fire is a powerful exploration of what happens when our darkest desires are left to roam unchecked, and signals the arrival of an astonishing and necessary voice in contemporary fiction.","[{'rating': 4, 'content': 'Quite a compelling collection of short stories--quiet, gothic horrors really that exemplify the complexities, the small and great tragedies of the human condition. Quite a sharp edge in these stories and she has a lot to say about women, girls trying to be in the world, the confines of bad marriages, the ravages of poverty and addiction. Many of these stories exemplify what good horror stories are supposed to do.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '“What do you know about what really goes on around here, mamita? You live here, but you’re from a different world.”3 1/2 stars. ^This is exactly how this whole book feels. I recognise the world in it; I suppose, in many ways, it\'s the one I live in... except it also isn\'t.It’s the dark spaces and the secrets hidden just under the surface of the world we know.I can definitely feel theShirley Jacksonvibe. Enríquez has written a collection of Argentinian horror stories, full of atmosphere, suspense and ofttimes the grotesque. But, like Jackson, most of these stories are characterized by their ability to feel normal at first, to portray real life and real people, but create a sense of the unnatural beneath it all. It\'s an unsettling undercurrent running behind the main events of each story.The author deftly weavespainfully human characters. Whether they be narcos, drug users or transvestites, they all come to life on the page, and in the intense, scary, manic and yet somewhat familiar world of the novel.Some of the stories are stranger than others and those were perhaps my least favourite. The ones where the author ranked up the ick factor were almost too much for me. Gory descriptions of the insides of small animals is not my cup of tea. But these were in the minority. Others captured small circles and underbellies of our own world in anextremely intense and emotive way.For example, ""The Intoxicated Years"". About those friendships so close, personal and intense that it\'s hard to separate yourself from the other person. This story chronicles a downward spiral into drug abuse over several years in the late 80s/early 90s. Intoxicating feels a deeply appropriate word, about more than just drug abuse - equally about the intoxicating nature of the relationships within, and the heady writing itself.Others border on more traditional horror about haunted houses and things that go bump in the night. Yet, of course, Enríquez puts her own spin on it and nothing is ever quite so simple as a haunted house. Still, passages like this will give traditional horror lovers some chills:“The house tells us the stories. You don’t hear it?”“Poor thing,” said Pablo. “She doesn’t hear the house’s voice.”“It doesn’t matter,” said Adela. “We’ll tell you.”And they told me.About the old woman, whose eyes had no pupils but who wasn’t blind.About the old man, who burned medical books out by the empty chicken coop, in the backyard.About the backyard, just as dry and dead as the front, full of little holes like the dens of rats.About a faucet that never stopped dripping, because the thing that lived in the house needed water.Frightening, dramatic, and impossible to look away from.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube|Store'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'En general no me molan los libros que contienen relatos, nunca los acabo.

Mariana Enríquez trata sus cuentos como denuncias de situaciones de todo tipo, la precariedad de la vida de los sintecho, las desigualdades económicas, la drogadicción o el fanatismo religioso o la superstición como salida inútil de la marginalidad de cualquier tipo, la represión, los asesinatos, las torturas, las desapariciones de la dictadura, los problemas mentales, la violencia machista, etc. etc, realidades todas francamente censurables.

What a creepy, gruesome, macabre read. This one is a series of 12 short stories. The stories are told from unnamed cities in Argentina. The stories really are all over the place. From murder, torture, ghost stories, urban legend, haunted houses, superstitions, love and heartbreak, and more. Some stories are stronger than others, as is usually the case with short stories. Not every story is perfectly wrapped up either. I didn't find that disappointing, more of a wanting. I wanted to hear more as the story was so good.I listened to this one via audio and the narrator was quite good.

These macabre stories are all set in contemporary Argentina. Many stories have a touch of unreality -- suggestions of ghosts and otherworldly beings. But the point of these suggested apparitions is to emphasize the horror of some aspects of contemporary Argentinian life -- extreme poverty, violence, drug addiction and crime. Often the central characters are middle class young men and women exposed to Argentina's dark underbelly -- and the hovering question is whether what they have seen is real or an apparition. Despite this common device and touch of unreality, the stories are very diverse in their characters and setting. I particularly liked a few of the longer ones:-The Dirty Kid -- about the narrator's obsession with a street kid who disappears in her neighbourhood.-Spiderweb -- about a women who goes on a trip with her unpleasant husband to visit a cousin-The Neighbor's Courtyard -- about a disgraced social worker keeping an eye on a potential child in distress in a neighbour's yard-Things We Lost in the Fire -- about a burn victim who holds audience in the subwayI recommend this to anyone who likes short stories and looks to literature to gain insight into different parts of the world.

Solo por ellos ya merece la pena leer la obra. Dos relatos donde la crítica social sobre el abandono infantil y sobre la violencia hacia las mujeres es demoledora y ante los cuales nadie puede quedar indiferente.Las quemas las hacen los hombres, chiquita. Siempre nos quemaron. Ahora nos quemamos nosotras. Pero no nos vamos a morir: vamos a mostrar nuestras cicatrices.Historias de infancia y de juventud (contadas por mujeres) con un toque de misterio, de sorpresa, de curiosidad... Un homenaje a esa pasión por lo diferente, por lo desconocido que a todos nos despierta el interés.Los relatos que nos trae Mariana Enríquez están poblados de fantasmas, asesinos, esqueletos, casas encantadas, magia negra, supersticiones, etc., sin embargo, es el mundo real que nos muestra el que nos produce mayor horror.Una realidad como una pesadilla de la que no es posible despertar. Así tenemos el género de terror como espejo de ese otro terror cotidiano que todos conocemos, pero al que no damos la debida importancia, como si no tuviera que ver con nosotros. Este contraste creo que potencia y da unidad al conjunto de todos los relatos.¿Qué pasó?—Encontraron a una criatura.—¿Muerta?—Qué te parece. ¡Degollada! ¿Tenés cable, amor mío?A Lala le habían cortado la conexión por falta de pago hacía meses.Enríquez escribe bien, con una prosa precisa y directa que a veces recuerda al realismo sucio, pero sin renunciar a lo trivial, a lo cotidiano e incluso, en esos mundos tan duros que nos presenta, se permite algunos toques de humor y de esperanza en la solidaridad (aquí quizá más exactamente sororidad). Otro punto a su favor son los escenarios, los ambientes a donde nos empuja la autora. Tan bien conseguidos (a veces incluso sin descripciones obvias) que logra que nos sintamos verdaderamente incómodos ante la gravedad de lo narrado.Las cosas que perdimos en el fuegoes un libro que recomendaría.PD: Creo que van a rodar una película sobre el relato que da título al libro.

It\'s very dark and disturbing.We all walk over bones in this city, it’s just a question of making holes deep enough to reach the buried dead.(No Flesh Over Our Bones)Tens of thousands of people were disappeared or killedfrom 1976 to 1983, when Argentina\'s military junta committed“crimes against humanity within the framework of [a] genocide.”While not overtly mentioned, the horrific tales inThings We Lost in the Fireareintertwined with Argentina\'s past.Past atrocities refuse to stay buried, always lurking in the back of the collective mind. These stories take place on top ofmass graves. These stories feature police brutality, depression, drug addicts, poverty, self-harm, and children deformed by pollution. The shrines to saints on every corner make all of these horrors feel even morehaunting.Many of the characters areresigned to the awful events they witness. Some of them end up not helping those in need, either because of lack of resources or helping could lead to worse consequences for themselves. In ""Green Red Orange,"" a man withdraws from the world and gets immersed in the deep web, where the worst of humanity is viewed as entertainment. Most of the characters are stuck inunhappy relationships. They resent their partners, but can\'t bring themselves to leave.Except for the first story, my favorites were in the second half:The Dirty Kid- A middle-class woman thinks the homeless boy who lives across from her home is the victim of a savage murder. She can\'t rest until she finds out if it\'s true. She regrets doing so little for the boy, despite witnessing the terrible conditions he lived in every day.An Invocation of Big-Eared Runt(read it at link) - My favorite! A man who leads murder tours is fascinated by a long-dead child murderer. At home, he resents how his wife transformed into a different person after the birth of their child. The quiet ending left me feeling uneasy about this family\'s future.The city didn’t have any great murderers if you didn’t count the dictators—not included in the tour for reasons of political correctness.No Flesh Over Our Bones- A woman becomes obsessed with an abandoned human skull.Under the Black Water- A district attorney investigates the case of two teenagers murdered by police officers. Months later, a witness tells her one of the victims has resurfaced. There\'s no way he survived, so she goes to investigate. When she arrives and sees all the shrines have disappeared, you know it\'s about to get terrifying! The nearby river\'s pollution is bad, but it might be covering for something even worse.Things We Lost in the Fire- After a rash of domestic violence, women begin setting themselves on fire. The old women\'s conversation at the end chilled me to the bone.“Burnings are the work of men. They have always burned us. Now we are burning ourselves. But we’re not going to die; we’re going to flaunt our scars.”Honorable Mention:The Neighbor\'s Courtyard -A depressed social worker sees a chance at redemption when she spots a chained boy in her neighbor\'s courtyard.I loved how the details of this story unraveled. It went from realistic to crazy at the very end, so I\'m not sure what to think of this one!I loved themix of history and horror. My favorite stories were those where the line between real life and the bizarre was the most blurred. Enríquez was masterful at creating acreepy atmosphere and building tension. I could feel the knot in my stomach getting tighter as each story progressed. My biggest complaint is that many of the stories feltincomplete. The tension would reach a fever pitch and then it would just end. There were moments in each story that I loved, but many times I was left with a ton of questions and no theories to ponder. If you enjoy supernatural tales and the dark and twisty characters of Gillian Flynn or Roxane Gay (Difficult Women), you might enjoy this short story collection. I recommend reading it in the dark!Another book that deals with Argentina during the late 70s:The Case of Lisandra P.- It has mixed reviews as a suspense novel, but some of the most powerful sections are when people talk about their experiences during that time period._________I received this book for free from Netgalley & Crown Publishing/Hogarth in exchange for an honest review.

Most of all, it's that this book has stayed with me. I think about it all the time. I recommend it often. I remember the way certain stories made me feel, and I remember specific details from others. All surefire signs of a favourite.My few original criticisms still stand: some stories end prematurely and/or glibly, and others (the title story in particular) are centred on rather unwieldy concepts. But the collection as a whole rises above these flaws. 'Adela's House' deserves to be regarded as one of the great modern horror stories. 'The Neighbour's Courtyard', 'The Dirty Kid', 'Under the Black Water' and 'Spiderweb' are excellent.

If you enjoy short stories, and particularly if you like them on the dark side, youmustread Enríquez.TinyLetter---Original review (September 2017)'Argentine gothic' is a fitting label forThings We Lost in the Fire.Ghosts, haunted houses and unexplained events appear throughout these stories, but they aren't necessarily horror as much as they are simplydark.Often suffused with the threat of real violence as well as supernatural terror, they touch on the hidden tensions and agonies of a country with a turbulent past roiling just beneath the visible surface. In this book, Argentina itself is haunted, a country haunted by history.In 'The Inn', a character is sacked because he has been telling tourists the true history of the town's inn, something its owner is keen to conceal. In 'Spiderweb', a burning house is seen from a plane, and minutes later there is only scorched earth; a woman runs out in front of a car and disappears, and the driver later learns a nearby bridge is rumoured to contain the skeletons of those murdered and hidden by the military. In 'Under the Black Water', the Riachuelo river is made monstrous by years of pollution, tradesmen dumping waste and police dumping bodies. Several of the stories contain sudden disappearances that remain unresolved – uncanny echoes of the phenomenon of 'the disappeared' caused by the Dirty War.My only complaint aboutThings We Lost in the Fireis that it suffers repeatedly from Premature Ending Syndrome. Time and time again, the stories cut off in what seems to be the middle of the most intriguing part, and end without explaining what has happened. In the best cases, as with 'Adela's House', this lack of explanation is itself a resolution, the absence of an answer being the most terrifying possible conclusion. In the worst cases, it feels like the stories have been erroneously published with bits missing. However, the quality of description and storytelling are so high that 'the worst' are still more than worth your time.Beautifully translated, with a crisp style that makes it difficult to believe these stories weren't originally written in English,Things We Lost in the Fireis a powerful, memorable collection. Every story seems to have multiple layers, making them perfect for critical analysis and discussion. My favourites were 'Adela's House', 'Dirty Kid' and 'The Neighbour's Courtyard'.Dirty KidA young woman, who we infer is middle-class, lives in her family's old home in what has become an unpleasant and dangerous neighbourhood. She often sees a woman who lives on the street with her young son. One day, the boy knocks on her door alone, and the narrator – reluctant to let him into her house – takes him to get ice cream. She later manages to reunite him with his mother, who reacts with rabid fury. The next day, a little boy is found raped, murdered and dismembered. The sheer horrifying violence of his death is a shock, and it heightens the narrator's sense of terrible guilt, her conviction (irrational in others' eyes) that the murdered boy is the 'dirty kid', as well as making a mockery of her romantic image of the neighbourhood. A startling opener to the collection.The InnFlorencia, a strait-laced teen, reunites with her friend Rocío; they plot to humiliate Elena, owner of the local inn, who has fired Rocío's father from his job as a tour guide. Part of the reason is that he's been telling tourists about the inn's dubious history as a police training academy during the dictatorship. When the girls sneak into the inn at night, they get more than they bargained for. As well as the menacing spectre of history, the terrifying experience they (and only they) endure works as a metaphor for Florencia's own fear of her burgeoning attraction to Rocío.The Intoxicated YearsScenes from the lives of three girls (children? teenagers? their ages aren't clear) between the late 1980s and early 1990s. The most interesting stuff seems to be happening in the background, just out of reach. Maybe that's the point, but I found this one a bit of a dud.Adela's HouseLittle Carla and her 11-year-old brother Pablo befriend Adela, a girl in their neighbourhood who was born with one arm and is an object of disgust and mockery for other kids at school. After getting obsessed with gory movies, Pablo and Adela decide to explore a nearby abandoned house, bringing Carla along with them. This is a superb tale of weirdness, dread and nameless horror. Like Tomás Eloy Martínez in his novelPurgatory,Enríquez uses magical realism to elucidate the experience of losing someone without explanation, reason or conclusion.An Invocation of the Big-Eared RuntThe protagonist works as a tour guide in Buenos Aires, telling tourists about the city's most famous serial killers (but not its dictators, though they are the most prolific murderers of all). Corporeal visions of a child killer become caught up with his resentment of his wife and newborn son.SpiderwebAn unhappily married woman visits family in the 'humid north'. Over the course of the trip, she becomes more and more convinced that she must leave her husband. Throughout the story, characters tell tales of strange things that have happened to them: disappearing figures, disappearing houses, dreams and visions of disaster. In the end, one of these strange incidents seems to befall the abhorred husband. Or is there a more ordinary, if just as horrifying, explanation? What is the 'misunderstanding' spoken of at the end?End of TermWhen Marcela, a previously unremarkable girl, starts to harm herself in gruesome and very public ways, her entire class is transfixed. The narrator is particularly fascinated – especially when Marcela tells her she sees and hears a man telling her to do these things. This feels like it could be a spooky story for children. It's macabre and has an effective jump-scare moment, but is a little thin.No Flesh Over Our BonesThis story somehow feels distinct from the others; it's less gritty and has a stronger sense of detachment from reality, while still retaining the darkness that pervades the whole collection. To the disgust of her boyfriend and mother, the narrator brings home a toothless skull she finds in a pile of rubbish, naming it 'Vera', and becomes obsessed with it. Perhaps the most important line comes close to the end: 'We all walk over bones in this city, it's just a question of making holes deep enough to reach the buried dead.'The Neighbour's CourtyardPaula and Miguel move into a new house, one the owner is suspiciously anxious to let quickly. Paula is battling depression, exacerbated by Miguel's prejudice against the idea of medication and/or psychiatric treatment, and is haunted by memories of her former job as a social worker, from which she was fired after a lapse of judgement. So there are multiple horrors here: mental illness; the anguish of not being seen or understood by someone who's supposed to love you; guilt; and the expected macabre twist – Paula sees a naked, filthy child chained up in the neighbour's courtyard, but when she tries to show Miguel, there's nothing to see.Similar to 'The Inn', where the source of dread is emblematic of history but also stands for Florencia's fear of her sexuality, here the figure of the boy seems like a physical manifestation of Paula's depression. Yet the ending subverts this. It's the opposite of 'Adela's House' – here the conclusive answer is the ultimate terror.Under the Black WaterMarina is a district attorney investigating what she suspects is a police cover-up. She's visited by a girl from the Villa Moreno slum who tells her Emanuel, presumed drowned, actually crawled out of the heavily polluted Riachuelo river alive, but 'changed'. Chasing the truth behind this strange story, Marina goes to Villa Moreno herself, finding it oddly silent and watchful. I'd have liked this to be longer, but it has a fantastic atmosphere and is so vivid. Of all the stories, this would make the best film.Green Red OrangeOne of the weaker stories, this is the tale of a young man who locks himself in his room and refuses to come out. It's told from the perspective of a woman he talks to online – the only way he communicates with the outside world. This itself is not particularly interesting, though there are some standout passages, particularly the episode of the teacher who invents a daughter.Things We Lost in the FireThis could have come straight out of Camilla Grudova'sThe Doll's Alphabet,and it reminded me of her story 'Unstitching', in which women begin to shed their skins, and the act, performed en masse, comes to signify a sort of feminist revolution. Here, the women of an unidentified city are seized by a craze for self-immolation, aiming to make themselves grotesque and undesirable – a subversion of an earlier spate of attacks on women by abusive partners. The imagery is strong, but I found the message a bit heavy-handed, especially when compared with the more subtle symbolism of many of the preceding stories.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Debo admitir que este libro me llevó bastante tiempo terminar... no porque fuera aburrido o porque no me gustara, sino porque la mayoría de sus cuentos me dejaron con una angustia y unos escalofríos tremendos.

It\'s just as wonderful the second time through.These stories feel both contemporary, and yet deeply connected with the magnificent stories of the macabre from past eras--stories that I have read over and over again, like The Monkey\'s Paw by Saki, and The Horla by de Maupassant, and The Most Dangerous Game by Connell, and anything ever written by Poe.What is different about Enriquez\'s stories--startlingly, shockingly, eye-opening-ly different--is how deeply they reflect a female perspective. Female fears. Female dreads.I say ""eye-opening"" because I never really took time to feel how masculine these old stories are until I read Enriquez\'s stories. I cut the old stories all kinds of slack because I read them as a child and they made me fall in love with reading. In many of my favorites, though, women might as well not exist--take ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" a story about two men locked in a life-and-death battle for survival. Other old tales of horror might include women characters now and then, but the stories frequently hinge on, let\'s face it, misogyny or gynophobia--check out ""Berenice"" by Poe, for example, if you haven\'t lately:https://www.eapoe.org/works/tales/ber...I loved every story here, which is unusual for me--typically I\'ll like one or two stories in a collection at most and then I\'ll get bored by the sameness on some level.

Given the hype around this collection and the comparisons to Shirley Jackson, I was prepared to read some truly unsettling tales. However, as with a lot of other contemporary authors of horror, Mariana Enríquez relies on body horror, gore, and animal violence to instil feelings of unease in her readers...and while her stories are certainly macabre, I wouldn\'t call them gothic. The horror too was too splatter for me. Writing about bodily fluids, decomposing or mutilated bodies, doesn\'t necessarily make your story scary. While reading these rather samey stories I merely felt a knee-jerk repulsion. Most stories are narrated by morbid and unsatisfied young women who are experience, or have experienced, something truly horrific: they loose childhood friends to haunted houses, they start seeing disturbing things such as chained ""deformed"" children, or they loose themselves in violent fantasies. They had more or less the same grunge-esque personality and or were aspiring to become part of their country\'s counter-culture. I found their voices to be monotonous and, given all their attempts at subversiveness, surprisingly banal.What frustrated me the most was the fact that not one of the story had a decent ending. I\'m all for open endings, and I think that short stories suit ambiguous endings...but here the stories never reached their apex. Each story would have these ominous first few lines, foreshadowing the horrors to come...but then the stories seemed to cut off just when things start to get vaguely intriguing or disturbing.Lastly, a lot of the stories relied on the appearance of ""deformed"" children or adults in order to unnerve its main characters...are we in the 1980s? Call me snowflake or whatever but I found the author\'s obsession with deformed bodies to be rather outdated.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Definitivamente Mariana Enríquez pasa a mi podio de autores favorites.

Doy un paso y dejo que la oscuridad me envuelva. Ay Mariana Enriquez, procederé a estar profundamente obsesionado con vos lo que resta del año.No parece hacer muchas limitaciones, solo creatividad desbordante: lo que pasa es muchas veces radical, hiperbólico, turbio y nada vacilante. Es siniestro y, mucho peor, es real, o mejor dicho, es siniestro PORQUE es real. Inquietan, reflexionan, rememoran, exponen (...)Y efectivamente no hay conclusiones, el terror persiste aún acabado el cuento. La autora no parece interesada en rematar con grandes finales, de hecho, muy pocas de todas estas historias llegan a un verdadero clímax en términos de trama, la mayoría restante se ve afectada porfinales abruptos, indeterminados, inquietantemente abiertos. Los finales de los libros puede ser una de las partes más polarizantes, pero ¿es esto un problema? no realmente, al menos no para mí, de hecho, creo que estas características que hacen las conclusiones de estos relatos son un pilar casi fundamental: la incertidumbre e inconclusión es igual o puede que más perturbadora que lo contado, hace que esto siga flotando por ahí, en nuestra mente.Ya sea para exponer las brechas sociales(""Me daba cuenta, mientras el chico sucio se lamía los dedos chorreados, de lo poco que me importaba la gente, de lo naturales que me resultaban esas vidas desdichadas"".), los alcances de la salud mental en la autolesión o la alimentación (""Él no tiene nada que ver con la belleza etérea de los huesos desnudos, él los tiene cubiertos por capas de grasa y aburrimiento"".)o como la tecnología consume al hombre moderno(""Hace casi dos años que se convirtió en un punto verde o rojo o anaranjado en mi pantalla. No lo veo, no deja que lo vea, que nadie lo vea"".), detrás de todas estas temáticas hay algo íntimo que es amplificado por la descripción, ambientación y narración que son flexibles, dinámicos y, sobre todo, mundanos, consiguiendo muchas veces que, por mucho terror que haya, pudieran hasta ser considerados relatos realistas.Esa delgada línea entre el terror sobrenatural y el realismo de las temáticas sociales hace de este libro algo apasionante y envolvente.De hecho, hay relatos que a la larga terminan siendo puramente realistas, PERO esto no significa que lo sobrenatural es ajeno, nunca pretende serlo: espíritus de víctimas de represión o de asesinos, típicas casas abandonadas, entidades místicas o cosas que ni siquiera se llegan a esclarecer si son o no son, son elementos recurrentes que atormentan estos personajes.Casi la totalidad de los relatos están protagonizados por mujeres, hay una crítica, un mensaje y una declaración clara, los horrores que la mujer sufre o se ve sometida constantemente están presentes a lo largo de todo el libro, ya sea como tema central, como el cuento que le da nombre y cierre a la novela, en donde se plantea esta realidad donde las mujeres se queman como una forma de empoderarse contra la violencia a la que son sometidas (pero que de alguna forma las termina haciendo víctima de igual forma, siendo incapaces de librarse de esta condición):""Pero no nos vamos a morir; vamos a mostrar nuestras cicatrices.""o ya sea de manera implícita en relatos que no precisamente giran en torno a ello(""¿Cuántos años iba a pasar así, asqueada cuando lo escuchaba hablar, dolorida cuando teníamos sexo, silenciosa cuando él confesaba sus planes de tener un hijo y reformar la casa?"").En efecto, más allá de ser una colección de cuentos, cada pieza se complementa y convive con la otra de tal manera que no se descontextualiza.

On a quiet corner in an old wooden building lies a shop filled with hundreds of second-hand books.Twenty-five-year-old Takako has never liked reading, although the Morisaki bookshop has been in her family for three generations. It is the pride and joy of her uncle Satoru, who has devoted his life to the bookshop since his wife Momoko left him five years earlier.When Takako's boyfriend reveals he's marrying someone else, she reluctantly accepts her eccentric uncle's offer to live rent-free in the tiny room above the shop. Hoping to nurse her broken heart in peace, Takako is surprised to encounter new worlds within the stacks of books lining the Morisaki bookshop.As summer fades to autumn, Satoru and Takako discover they have more in common than they first thought. The Morisaki bookshop has something to teach them both about life, love, and the healing power of books.","[{'rating': 2, 'content': ""2.5 starsThe premise of this book sounded interesting and, even though I couldn't connect to Takako's character, I enjoyed the first part that takes place in the bookshop. I started losing interest in the second part that centers more around her uncle's wife.My main complaint is that I found the writing simplistic and the characters rather flat. There was no depth in their relationships and conversations. Not sure if it's the writing style or the translation.

Depressed and unemployed, Takako is glad for the room above the Morisaki Bookshop to hide from the rest of the world even though she doesn’t quite enjoy reading. Surrounded by towering stacks of second-hand books and people who love reading, Takako eventually finds herself opening up to new experiences, making friends in the community, forging a bond with her uncle and finding joy, inspiration and hope in reading.The narrative is divided into two segments the first of which focuses on Takano’s journey and the second segment, set a year later, revolves around her uncle and his wife Momoko whose sudden return five years after she left him has him seeking the answers to several unanswered questions. Her aunt’s return and their evolving friendship also encourage Takako to reconsider her own priorities.“No matter where you go, or how many books you read, you still know nothing, you haven’t seen anything. And that’s life. We live our lives trying to find our way.”Touching upon themes of family, friendship, new beginnings and most importantly the transformative power of books, this is a sweet, simple story that would appeal to book lovers and bibliophiles. I really liked the premise ofDays at the Morisaki BookshopbySatoshi Yagisawa(translated byEric Ozawa), and loved the descriptions of the Jimbocho Book Town (brought back some fond memories of College Street /”Boi Para” of Kolkata, India) and the literary references. The author also references the Kanda Used Book Festival, the largest annual event held in Kanda's Jimbocho secondhand book district that started in 1960. The narrative is evenly paced and compact but I thought the writing (or maybe the translation) was a tad choppy and lacking in depth. Though I didn’t enjoy the second segment of the narrative as much as the first, overall I didn't dislike this short novel in its totality.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Gli autori giapponesi hanno un super potere da non sottovalutare: riescono a descrivere le più semplici azioni quotidiane come se fossero parte di un altro piano esistenziale.

I loved how Yagisawa skillfully crafted an engaging story from a fairly simple plot, with a few minor twists. It was like feasting on a well prepared meal (like Ramen) made from a few fresh, high-quality ingredients.Days at the Morisaki Bookshop brought to life the rich atmosphere in the Jimbocho district in Tokyo, with its myriad bookstores and throngs of avid book enthusiasts. So, you might ask why was it not a 5⭐ read for me? All I can say is that this novel did not linger with me after I finished it. Days at the Morisaki Bookshop was an entertaining read, however, after I set it aside I moved on to reading the next book on my list without dwelling on it. I think this may partly be due to the story's somewhat happy ending, which seemed a bit too perfect. Although, I must confess as I was reading this book, I was thinking to myself that I could see this being made into a movie - which apparently has been done in Japan!

A bike to the left, and a sea of books – left – top - right. And, there is a door in the middle with a silhouette of what we can presume is a man to the left and a woman to the right. And, the title of the book is in the center at the top. There are other details if you want to really spend some time reviewing the cover which makes it even more fun.I bring this up because it is the cover of this book that attracted me to read it.And, to be honest it is another one of those books with the word “bookshop” in the title that also got me interested. I like to read at least one book (a month, if possible) with a bookshop in my reading adventure list in-between a mystery (if it isn’t a mystery, as well).And, this one is written by a Japanese writer and translated by Eric Ozawa.One thing I believe that is often true for us readers, is that we are drawn to bookstores like nature lovers are drawn to views. Whenever my husband and I were travelling we couldn’t leave a town without stopping at the local bookstore or library. It was a must-see stop, ALWAYS. If they were closed, I would just salivate at the window display. At least I, could look at the latest best sellers, or get a sense of who their local authors were, by who they displayed in their window.Bottom line, there is something hopeful about bookstores. I can’t help but love the smell of books, the touch of books, and don’t we just feel a little bit smarter when we are surrounded by books? Well, at least I pretend to be.But I digress. Let’s get to this review.This is a heart-warming story that shows how literature helps to open doors for those who have difficulty expressing their feelings. Like Takado, our main character.And speaking of Takado, she is our plain-speaking 25-year-old narrator. She doesn’t express her feelings well to others. And thus, it is no surprise how easily she has been taken advantage of by her boyfriend, Hideaki. We quickly learn on page 1, that he has dumped Takado and has announced he is getting married, but still wants to play around with her, even though he is engaged to somebody else.Takado always thought they were serious, even though he didn’t want anyone to know they were in a relationship (they both worked together). So, Takado’s only recourse is to quit her job and head home to mope.Her Uncle Satoru offers her free lodging if she will help in his bookshop. Feeling that she really doesn’t have much choice, she takes him up on the offer.“That’s where my real life began. And I know without a doubt, that if not for those days, the rest of my life would have been bland, monotonous, and lonely.”The characters of her uncle, his wife and others are quite interesting, quirky and personable and add to the enjoyment of the story.And as the story unfolds, readers watch as life opens up in ways Takado never thought possible.And, as readers, who already love to read, we get to watch Takado’s self-confidence grow, as well as witness how the importance of reading can and does make a difference in a person’s life.And, that my friends, is the beauty of the transformation of books.Sidenote: this book was originally published in Japan 2010, and adapted into film in Japan, but was not translated into English until 2023.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3,5. Takako es una joven de 25 años que acaba de perder de golpe tanto a su pareja y como su trabajo. Esto la sumerge en una profunda apatía, alejándose de todo y de todos. Sin embargo, un día recibe la llamada de su tío Satoru, al cual lleva más de diez años sin ver. Este tiene una propuesta que hacerle, y después de presionarla, consigue que Takako se mude a vivir al pequeño pisito ubicado en la planta superior de la librería de segunda mano Morisaki, en el famoso barrio de las librerías, Jinbocho, el más grande del mundo dedicado a los libros. Satoru heredó la librería hace años y tras muchas idas y venidas por el mundo, descubrió que esta pequeña librería era su lugar en el mundo. ¿Puede encontrar Takako el mismo regocijo en la librería Morisaki?No puedo remediar amar profundamente este tipo de historias que nos muestra el día a día de sus personajes, centrándose en lo cotidiano para mostrarnos el dilema de sus protagonistas y como estos buscan consuelo en lo esencial. Es un poco lo que pasa con Takako, que pese a que de niña quería y admiraba a su tío, la adolescencia rompió esa imagen que tenia sobre él, sin embargo, acaba encontrando en él y sobre todo en la librería Morisaki el consuelo que necesita, ese algo al que aferrarse para volver a salir a flote. Creo que a cualquier lector le gusta encontrar historias donde los libros se muestren como salvavidas, como elementos de aprendizaje y crecimiento. Es imposible no empatizar con ese sentimiento que todos hemos vivido en algún momento.Leí este libro con una amiga y desde que lo conocimos con su edición en italiano, sabíamos que era el tipo de lectura que disfrutaríamos. De entrada se nos antojaba que “Mis días en la librería Morisaki” iba a ser este tipo de libro confortable, que a mí me gusta comparar con dar un paseo por un lugar agradable, del que siempre sales reconfortado, y aunque es totalmente ese tipo de libro, ambos tuvimos la misma sensación sobre él: libro bonito y tierno muy disfrutable, pero que nos hubiese gustado que fuera más largo, para que fuera más reposado y poder indagar algo más en algunos momentos y personajes. Se nos hizo demasiado breve y alguna trama se queda poco explorada.El libro se divide en dos partes muy diferenciadas y claramente la primera parte con Takako y Satoru en la librería ha sido mi favorita, y me ha gustado bastante más que la segunda, que podría ser más profunda que la primera, pero me ha dejado con ganas de ver más. Lo que sí he disfrutado mucho ha sido la relación que se forja entre Takako y Wada, un personaje que aparece en esta segunda parte, aunque también me hubiera gustado verla más mostradaEso sí, disfruto mucho de la habilidad de los japoneses no solo para crear historias agradables y reconfortantes, si no para ubicarlas en escenarios que sin haber visto en tu vida, te resultan familiares, hogareños, lugares en los que sientes que has estado, aunque nunca los hayas visitado. Pasa un poco eso con Jinbocho, ese barrio lleno de librerías (que ya pongo como objetivo de vida visitarlo algún día), también con Morisaki, esa librería llena de libros por todas partes o el monte donde sus protagonistas viajan para desconectar de la ciudad. Los autores japoneses consiguen sumergirme como nadie en esos lugares que describen.Pese a que me he quedado con ganas de que “Mis días en la librería Morisaki” fuese más extenso, lo bueno es que el autor escribió un segundo libro varios años después, que al parecer está centrado en Satoru y Momoko, siendo este último un personaje que me hubiera gustado conocer más y mejor, así que ojalá la editorial se anime a traernos también esta segunda entrega, porque pienso lanzarme de cabeza.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'It gently eased my soul.'}, {'rating': None, 'content': 'Sutil como la ceremonia del té, hermosa como los cerezos en flor y melancólica como el cine de autor japonés, así es la novela corta Mis días en la librería Morisaki de Satoshi Yagisawa que ha conquistado el corazón de lectores bibliófilos a lo largo y ancho de todo el mundo y que, con traducción de Estefanía Asins, acaba de ser editada en España por Plata Editores, un nuevo sello que promete darnos muchas alegrías lectoras.Y es que solo se me ocurre un escenario más sugerente para un amante de los libros que una librería: un barrio lleno de ellas. Allí, a Jinbōchō, es donde da a parar Takako después de que le rompan el corazón y necesite un lugar donde replantearse su futuro. Su tío regenta una antigua librería familiar de segunda mano especializada en literatura japonesa y le ofrece el ático del local para que allí la joven vuelva a conectar consigo misma.Al principio se siente perdida y fuera de lugar en un ambiente tan bucólico e intelectual… Pero el olor del polvo de los antiguos volúmenes apilados en las estanterías, el ambiente del barrio bohemio, las peculiaridades de cada uno de los clientes habituales… le hacen conectar con más cosas además de consigo misma: con el gran desconocido que resultó ser su tío, con los chicos que regentan el café de la esquina… y hasta con un apuesto y misterioso lector que se pasa las horas leyendo siempre en la misma mesa.Mis días en la librería Morisaki es una obra cálida que hará disfrutar al público lector al que le apasionan las historias serenas, introspectivas, que se cocinan a fuego lento. Además de una adquisición perfecta para conmemorar el Marzo asiático, esta obra es un bucólico paréntesis del torbellino urbano que nos rodea.Y es que… ¿quién no ha sido Tatako en algún momento de su vida? ¿Quién no ha necesitado frenar en seco para tomar impulso? ¿Quién no se ha dado cuenta de que ha construido una vida de espaldas a sus raíces? ¿Quién no sueña con una época dedicada solamente a escucharse a sí mismo, a emprender un nuevo rumbo, a recargar las pilas?Mis días en la librería Morisaki hará las delicias del público japonófilo. Entre sus páginas se nos narra el día a día de un rincón oculto de esa inabarcable urbe, pero también se nos desmenuzan distintas formas de vivir y sentir en el Tokio de hoy en día. Cada uno de los curiosos personajes con los que confraterniza la tímida Tatako representa una forma de ser distinta que encapsula al propio Japón: su melancólico tío, su extravagante tía, los chismosos chicos del café, el hierático cliente habitual… constituyen un mosaico que nos habla de una sociedad compleja, contradictoria, en constante evolución.Esta breve y sutil novelita es una lectura perfecta para recuperar la fe en el poder sanador de los libros, para hacer despertar el amor por las pequeñas cosas que a menudo nos pasan desapercibidas en nuestro ajetreado día a día.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""This book is without a doubt, a truly heartwarming read. It envelops you in its warmth like a cherished, old sweater, making it feel like a literary hug. At its core, this book is a celebration of the transformative power of literature, how books can quietly but profoundly alter the course of our lives. It's a wholesome, sweet, and comforting story that will undoubtedly leave a lasting imprint on your heart.From that moment on, I read relentlessly, one book after another. It was as if a love of reading had been sleeping somewhere deep inside me all this time, and then it suddenly sprang to life.Little by little, I felt something wash over me, a feeling of peace that words can't express. If I had to explain it, I'd say it could only have come from the writer's fervent love for life.The story revolves around a small, second-hand bookshop, Morisaki Bookshop, and the wonderful cast of characters who call it home. The narrative centers on Takako, whose life takes a transformative turn following a heartbreak when she retreats to her family's bookstore, managed by her uncle Saturo. As the characters navigate the ups and downs of life, their journeys are intertwined with the books they read and recommend, resulting in a brilliant tapestry of self-discovery.At some point in the past, someone reading this book had felt moved to take a pen and draw a line under these words. It made me happy to think that because I had been moved by that same passage too, I was now connected to that stranger.Another time, I happened to find a pressed flower someone had left as a bookmark. As I inhaled the scent of the long-ago-faded flower, I wondered about the person who had put it there. Who in the world was she? When did she live? What was she feeling?It's only in secondhand books that you can savor encounters like this, connections that transcend time. And that's how I learned to love the secondhand bookstore that handled these books, our Morisaki Bookshop. I realized how precious a chance I'd been given, to be a part of that little place, where you can feel the quiet flow of time.The prose is simple yet eloquent, like a soothing melody that lingers in your mind long after you've turned the last page.""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""I usually avoid books set in bookstores and libraries because they tend to be too sentimental for my tastes (How Can I Help Youbeing a delicious exception).This book, unfortunately, is not an exception.

Un lugar de paz, donde el tiempo parece detenerse y suceden conversaciones cultas e interesantes sobre literatura japonesa entre personajes inolvidables. ¿Qué podría ir mal ante semejante caramelito para los amantes de la literatura sobre librerías?Eso es lo que la premisa de este título nos avanza en su contraportada, otra cosa es lo que los lectores encontraremos. No os engañaré, esta lectura ha sido la peor que he tenido en los últimos meses. Algo que obviamente no esperaba, ya que a pesar de saber que no iba a ser un libro inolvidable tenía el convencimiento de que encontraría una historia “feel good”, algo agradable y ligero para disfrutar.Nada más lejos de la realidad: entre sus páginas he hallado una trama lineal, sumamente básica y carente de descripción alguna, dotada de personajes planos, sin carácter definido y sumamente incoherentes (mención especial a la protagonista que no puede ser más repelente). La trama, aparte de previsible, en muchas ocasiones pierde el sentido, fuerza relaciones y sentimientos que no traspasan las páginas y no convencen en absoluto al lector.Eso no es todo: aquí no hay literatura, ni cultura japonesa, ni librerías, ni largas charlas emocionantes, ni puesta en situación… La novela bien podría estar ambientada en una heladería de un centro comercial en Estados Unidos y no notaríamos la diferencia. La narración, los diálogos y cómo se desarrollan los hechos, denota que estamos ante un relato banal, por su sencillez y por la escasa profundidad general.En definitiva, me he llevado una gran decepción con esta obra contando que lo mejor que he encontrado es la ilustración de la portada. Y encima, no podía faltar el drama metido con calzador que encontraremos al final y el nacimiento de un amor que no veíamos venir (nótese la ironía).

It’ s a gentle, slice-of-life narrative set in Jimbōchō, the district of Tokyo famous for its array of second-hand bookshops. After a disastrous end to a relationship Takako is drifting and melancholy, she leaves her job and reluctantly moves into a small room over her uncle’s bookshop. Yagisawa’s novel details Takako’s journey as she finds solace in reading and the small pleasures offered by the local community: from eccentric customers to charming coffee shops. The story then skips ahead over a period of years, moving from Takako to her uncle Satoru as he’s reunited with his long-lost wife Momoko, after her mysterious disappearance.

But Winter Solstice is finally approaching, and with it, the joy of a hard-earned reprieve.Yet even the festive atmosphere can't keep the shadows of the past from looming.

The words might have been the same; my thoughts came with an eye roll instead of pleasure though. As did a lot of other things while I read this novella. Don’t get me wrong, I still enjoyed almost every second of this and it was really nice to spend some time with all those characters again BUT (yes, it’s a big but) there were a lot of things that didn’t sit well with me and you can bet your lovely behind on the fact that I’m going to point them out later on when I get to the spoilery parts of this review.Generally speaking this wasn’t bad. We got to see a little bit of our characters normal lives and I think we can all agree that after everything they went through they deserve some normalcy and happiness. It was nice to walk through Velaris, to go Solstice shopping with Mor and Feyre and to see those beloved characters interact with each other. They all survived the war and each and every single one of them is trying to cope with the aftermath. There are plenty of wounds that still need to heal and I’m kind of grateful Sarah decided to give her characters some room to come to terms with everything. So yes, this novella might not have a huge plot but definitely provides a good transition into the next series. ;-)Still, there were quite a lot of interesting dialogues and a bunch of things that either made me happy or caused me to get angry. Mostly it was the relationships between the characters and so this is exactly what I’m going to write about. Buckle up! This is going to be a hard ride! *lol*From here on out, I’ll talk about the relationships and ships of the characters, so this isn’t only going to be rant and gush feast but also a spoiler celebration! If you still continue to read and haven’t read ACOFAS yet, it’s at your own risk! Don’t say I didn’t warn you! ;-)The relationships & ships:Feyre & Rhys:”But you are bothering – you’re both still working to make this peace last. Peace, Rhys. We have peace, and the true kind. Enjoy it – enjoy each other. You paid the debt before it was ever a debt.”I totally agree with Cassian and even though this might sound harsh now I still need to say it: I want them to enjoy each other too, but please not as the MCs of the following books. I love Feyre and Rhys, I really do, but I think from ACOWAR on out their character development was kind of detrimental. I already mentioned it in my review of ACOWAR and I’ll say it again Feyre’s and Rhys’s holier-than-thou attitude is beginning to get on my nerves. Feyre and her friends weren’t the only ones that suffered and it would be really nice if she’d get out of her pink bubble and would acknowledge the fact that others hurt too! It’s good that Rhys and her have each other but not everyone is as lucky as them and it would help to remember that they made mistakes too! Also if I read about “toes that curl” in Feyre’s boots one more time I’m going to be sick. Yes, we got it, Rhys is such a sexy male and they really love each other. If you ask me their story should have ended after ACOWAR because right now I have more negative feelings towards them than positive ones and this is actually kinda sad. >_< Okay, Feysand shippers are allowed to take out their pitchforks and torches now... Just give me a little head start, will you? ;-PFeyre & Lucien:”And what, exactly, does this Band of Exiles plan to do? Host events? Organize party-planning committees?”Lucien’s metal eye clicked faintly and narrowed. “You can be as much of an asshole as that mate of yours, you know that?”I think Feyre was a real bitch to Lucien in this book. And no, I’m not sorry for saying it out loud. After all someone has to do it and I don’t mind it being me. I mean if she really wants him to be friends with her, she has to accept that he has his own life and doesn’t want to depend on her and Rhys. If she’d be honest to herself she’d realize that Lucien isn’t welcome at her court and that he has his reasons to stay away from them. I think the only two people who feel real sympathy for Lucien are Az and Amren and they only do it to some extent. So yeah, she can’t expect him to be happy with the situation. Lucien lost so much over the centuries and now he even lost Tam and his second home. It’s not Feyre’s call to decide what’s best for him! Especially because she’s actually the reason why Lucien isn’t welcome at Tam’s place anymore. So nope, take care of your own court and leave Lucien be! Thank you very much! And a huge YAY for Lucien! Because he dared to call Feyre and Ryhs out on their bullsh*t and didn’t back down! That’s my man!!! <333 Also I totally agree with him! Rhys shouldn’t have said what he did and the way he treated Tam cost him a lot of my sympathy.”Your mate should have known better than to kick a downed male.””I can’t stand to be in the same room as her for more than two minutes. I can’t stand to be in this court and have your mate pay for the very clothes on my back.”Elain & Lucien:”He hadn’t mentioned Elain, or his proximity to her. Elaine had not asked him to stay, or to go. And whether she cared about the bruises on his face, she certainly hadn’t let on.”So if you already put away your pitchforks and torches, guess now is the right time to draw them out again, because this isn’t going to be nice and tell you what: I actually don’t care! I’ll say it as it is: I HATE Elain! There, I said it! And I’m not even sorry for it! You think Nesta is a witch? Oh well, guess Elain is even worse because she hides it behind her super sweet appearance and gentle actions. By now I’ve reached a point where I despise her and I’m sick and tired of everyone defending this woman just because she is so sweet! Where was Elain when Feyre was taken by Tam? What did Elain do when Feyre went out hunting for them? Nesta might be a witch, and I can’t even believe I’m saying this, but at least she went looking for Feyre. What did Elain do? She got engaged to Grayson! YAY! Way to go! Also everyone loving precious and dear Elain! WTF?!!! Did Elain ever do anything except of looking lovely?! (Yes, she might be a great cook and good at gardening but seriously is that all!???!!!) AND WHY THE FREAKING HELL IS EVERYONE DEFENDING ELAIN WITH THE WORDS “Elain is Elain”!??? ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?? WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN!!?? I’m sick and tired of her getting away with everything because she’s everybody’s darling! Lucien deserves so much better than that! She can’t even talk to him for a few minutes? She can’t even thank him for the present he got her? Where was her present for him?! And just for the record: LUCIEN DIDN’T WANT HER TO BE HIS MATE!!! He’s as innocent when it comes to their mating bond as Elain! It’s not his fault that they are mates and people better remember this when they judge him for trying to get to know her! She doesn’t even give him a chance to get to know her so she’s just cruel and mean in my eyes. If she doesn’t change her attitude in the next trilogy I’ll never ship her with anyone. Not even Az. No one! For all I care she can live with her precious flowers and become one of them! GRRRRRRR!!!! AKDFASDFJASLDFJKASDFLK! Okay, I’m fine now. XD”Elain, at least, would be too polite to send Lucien away when he wanted to help. She was too polite to send him away on a normal day. She just ignored him or barely spoke to him until he got the hint and left.”Those doe-brown eyes turned toward me. Sharper than I’d ever seen them. “And that entitles him to my time, my affections?”“No.” I blinked. “But he is a good male.” Despite our harsh words. Despite this Band of Exiles bullshit. “He cares for you.”“He doesn’t know me.”“You don’t give him the chance to even try to do so.”Cassian & Nesta:”A storm is going to hit in a few days. I’d like you to distribute this amongst those who might feel its impact the hardest.”Cassian is so, so damn precious and he’s stuck with Nesta! That’s not fair! I think when it comes to me disliking characters in this series it’s a tie between Nesta and Elain. I just hate them both. (I know I’m making a lot of friends with this review. *lol* But I just can’t help it!) I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to ship them but after seeing that Nesta still didn’t change... Well, I just can’t ship them. By now I don’t even know if her character can be redeemed and if Sarah doesn’t work her magic with her I’ll never board this ship. And it will take a HUGE amount of magic to make her character at least a little bit more likable! And to everyone out there who likes Nesta and thinks I’m mean: I know she has PTSD too and I know that she suffers at least as much as all the other characters around her do, but that’s no reason to lash out at the others. If she wants to be secluded from them, live in a cheap apartment, drink all day and sleep with every fae male that comes her way: Okay! But to hurt the others, to fight them even though they are trying to help her, to spend Feyre’s and Rhys money without asking them: That’s not okay!! How many people have to offer her help until she accepts it? How often will she hurt poor Cassian because she’s just too proud to acknowledge that she has a serious problem? Just like Lucien, Cassian deserves so much better than her and I think I’ll make a petition for both of them! #FreeCassian&LucienFromTheClutchesOfTheCruelArcheronSisters”Nesta is Nesta. She does what she wants, even if it kills her sister. I’ve offered her job after job, and she refuses them all.”Tamlin & Rhys:Forgiveness could be a gift to both, but what he’d done... “Do you want her to?”His green eyes were empty. “Do I deserve it?”No. Never.He must have read it on my face, because he asked, “Do you forgive me – for your mother and sister?”I’m not okay with the way Rhys treated Tamlin! Yes, he made mistakes, yes he hurt Feyre, but that doesn’t mean that they have to hurt him too! Rhys should have known better than that, he should have been better than that and he shouldn’t have kicked Tam when he was already on the ground. Everyone can see that Tamlin is hurting and to treat him like that? To say what Rhys said to him? WOAH!! That was just cruel, mean and uncalled-for. I’m feeling really sorry for Tam now and Rhys helping him with the elk doesn’t make this any better. He only helped him because he might need him in future, not because he actually cared. Where is your compassion for Tam, Rhys? Where is the Rhys of ACOMAF I fell in love with? I don’t see him anymore. *shakes head*”I hope you live the rest of your miserable life alone here. It’s a far more satisfying end than slaughtering you.”Elain & Az:Cassian sat up, the portrait of outrage. “No?”Azriel tucked in his wings. “Would you want people betting on you?”I think the only reason Az reacted like that is because he might feel guilty for liking Elain. It’s so obvious that Sarah wants them to end up together and all those little tense moments between them speak volumes about her intentions. But as I said: I can’t ship Elain with anyone right now. Az is too sweet and gentle to end up with her and I really don’t want them to be together. Not because I would begrudge him a relationship with her, but because I think that he deserves better than her. After Mor played with him for centuries Az deserves the world, and then some! If Elain doesn’t change and acknowledges her misbehaviour against Lucien then I can’t ship this ship. And quite honestly, if I’d be Az I wouldn’t want to be with someone who treats their mate like that.”Azriel emerged from the sitting room, a glass of wine in hand and wings tucked back to reveal his fine, yet simple black jacket and pants.I felt, more than saw, my sister go still as he approached. Her throat bobbed.”Rhys & Lucien:”I can let go of the taunts,” he said, scanning my face. “And the fact that he still harbors some hope of one day reuniting with Tamlin. But I cannot let go of how he treated you after Under the Mountain.”I’m just glad that Lucien became friends with Vassa and Jurian because as I already mentioned above, he obviously isn’t welcome at the Night Court. Rhys still doesn’t like him and Lucien deserves more than to be tolerated. He deserves to be respected, to be loved and cherished and not to be treated like sh*t! Also what the hell does Rhys even mean with how he treated Feyre after Under the Mountain? Lucien did nothing wrong, he was there for her, tried to help her, defended her against Tam, spoke up for her and confronted Tamlin. And what did he get in return? Tamlin reprimanded him and might have even physically hurt him, Ianthe abused him and Tam let it happen because he refused to take part in the ritual, and Feyre?! Do I really have to point out what Feyre did? She lied to him, claimed that Rhys had turned her and even after she came back to the spring court she continued to lie to him and hurt him even more by destroying the only place he called home. Hell, she even used him to antagonize Tam and to destroy his friendship with Lucien. A great friend she was to him! And this after everything he did for her Under the Mountain. Hell, he even got whipped because he helped her and almost died as well. To destroy your friends’ life is a great way to show him gratitude. Well done, Feyre! So WHO EXACTLY TREATED WHOM LIKE SH*T AFTER UNDER THE MOUNTAIN, RHYS???!!!! Mhmm??? Care to enlighten me? And one more thing before I come to the end of thisrantreview: Lucien was in no position to help Feyre because he suffered from PTSD too. That’s something everyone always seems to forget. You can’t help someone else if you’re drowning yourself. And people better keep that in mind before they talk badly about him.Conclusion:I really thought I’d enjoy this novella and then move on to the next trilogy but for some reason those 229 pages kinda irked me. Big time. *lol* I guess that’s mostly due to the fact that all the things I already criticized in ACOWAR seemed to be even more prominent in this short story and I just couldn’t ignore it any longer. Also all the chapters we got from Mor’s POV didn’t contribute anything to the story, which is the main reason I didn’t even mention her in my review. All told this was a nice addition to the first trilogy and a good segue into the next one and I really hope that Sarah J. Maas will tackle all those issues I just pointed out.

Uhhh we shall find out I guess.Speaking more generally,this book was just mostly bad.I’m not only talking aboutthe writing, whichneeded a lot of editing, but the general feeling surrounding it all. Starting from the blurb, which is just a few sentences from the first chapter copypasted together. People, the blurb doesn’t even make sense. That extra sentence about snow? It shouldn’t be there. They obviously needed one more sentence to make the blurb longer and didn’t know what else to pick. It’s just bad. Whoever did that did a very poor job.* And that makes me angry.*EDIT: oh boy they changed the blurb!!! More than a full week after the book released! But I got receipts. #NeverForgetTheBlurbAuthors, even big ones, still have to fight hard to see their books picked up by publishers, be sold, and then be read and hyped by readers. But apparently that rule doesn’t apply to SJM.The publisher doesn’t even put any effort in pre-release things like writing a decent blurb, because they know her books are going to sell anyway. And I mean, I’m here writing this review because I’ve read this book despite swearing that I was done with this series after ACOWAR, because she has a talent for making you want to know what happens to the characters, even if (especially if) they’re not the main ones.But the least the author and the publisher could do is put some fucking effort and deliver a product that’s better than this. Instead, it feels likeeither SJM is a rare case of writer who gets worse every book she writes, or the publisher has decided that she’s still going to sell regardless how many rounds of editing her books get,so they might as well never edit them, thus never delivering a polished book.Because, folks, we might have started making fun of the wordm*tefor shits and giggles, but it’s become a big fucking problem, especially in this book. You know the writing advice that says to just use someone’s name when talking about them, instead of saying, idk, “the French girl,” or “the red-haired boy”? SJM has never heard of it. Think about your own internal monologue. Do you think of your spouse as “my spouse” all the time? Or do you simply think about them with their name?Cassian and my mate’s sister did not speak to each other at all.This sentence just does not flow. And it’s just one of about 70 times the word m*te was used (and keep in mind this is a 200 pages book).I wonder how many creative writing students failed their assignments for doing exactly what the most hyped YA fantasy author these days does constantly.Do we also want to have The Talk about theweird connotations and implicationsthat this word has? Oh boy, this conversation is about three years late, but I absolutely Do Not like all this animalistic shit, starting with m*te, moving on to how many times people purr, referring to people as males and females (ah, the good ol’ binary) (YES I FUCKING KNOW SHE CAN’T CALL THEM MEN AND WOMEN BUT JFC JUST STOP), to the weird possessiveness that the whole m*ting system entails. Also!!! Toxic masculinity!!!!!!! Weird unchallenged sexist comments!!!!! Trying to make Rhys sound soooo feminist when apparently his job is being horny 24/7!!!!!! Have Rhys (a literal sexual abuse victim) talk about how hecan’t standto be next to his m*te without, and I quote, BEING BURIED INSIDE HER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ohhhh now you\'ve done it, you got me mad. If you read a SJM book it seems like thinking/talking/having sex for most part of your day is the normalcy. Which it can be!!!! But guess what! Ace people exist!!!! People with low sexual drive exist!!!!!!!!!! That’s normal too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh no I’m using too many exclamation points let me hire an editor. When every single character you portray acts the same exact way towards something like sex, you’re telling your readers (mostly teens) that that’s what’s expected of them, that that’s how everyone is like. It’s no secret that diversity doesn’t exist in SJM’s world, and that involves how people view sex and romantic relationships too.It’s amazing that YA books have sex positivity.But books need to also acknowledge that ace people exist too. Protagonists and love interests that aren’t some sort of sex gods need to be there too. Thin boys, fat boys, trans boys need to be there too.If after >10 books a writer can’t get out of her own self-insert fantasies about what type of men she likes, maybe she isn’t a great writer after all.Maybe she needs to listen to the (still too small) part of her readers that demand More, that demand Better.I went on a HUGE tangent and I don\'t even fucking care. There were parts of the book that I liked. I even enjoyed most of its central part. I enjoyed Nesta’s PTSD portrayal and she’s the only reason I’m going to read the next book because parts of her trauma and her way of dealing with it have the potential to mean so fucking much to me. But I’m going to lower my rating to 1 star because I’m tired of all the things I mentioned above,I\'m tired of being treated like shit by an author and her team because they expect me to worship her when she doesn\'t even try anymore.My 1 star isn\'t even gonna change anything because everyone’s giving this the usual five stars, but I don’t care. I’m here and as a readerI demand better, I demand the bare fucking minimum, and I don’t think this book even tried.This was a buddy read withmy bon m@te(I’m sorry)____Correct me if I\'m wrong but shouldn\'t blurbs, like, tell you something about the book..........why is this one just a recap of the previous ones lmaoAlso shout-out to sjm for managing to squeeze the word ""mate"" within like 100 words of bad blurb'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '#1A Court of Thorns and Roses★★★★★#2A Court of Mist and Fury★★★★★#3A Court of Wings and Ruin★★★★★#3.5A Court of Frost and Starlight★★★★★First of all, let me just express my total devastation that an entire year of counting down the days until this book’s release isgonein two and a half hours of reading. I mean, I knew it was only going to be a novella, but… *sobs quietly*I didn’t expect it to go by THAT fast!This amazing little series has pulled me through some really dark times and brought so much joy into my life that I know I will treasure it, always. ♥Even now, with that bond again flowing between us like a river of star-flecked night, the echo of its vanishing lingered.ACOFAS definitely doesn’t read anything like the 3 main novels; the chapters switch perspectives occasionally, featuring POVs from Feyre, Rhysand, Cassian, and Morrigan. What struck me as particularly odd about this was the fact that Feyre and Rhysand’s chapters were in first-person, while Cassian and Morrigan’s were in third—a slightly jarring writing style, but nothing too detrimental.In his stare, I could have sworn galaxies swirled. In the shadows between his wings, the glorious depths of the night dwelled.We do get some really sweet and domestic Feysand moments, but I was actually surprised at how little time they actually spend together during the novella (and how little sex there is—who is this author and what did she do with Sarah?!). We did finally get the infamous wall scene! There are some incredibly sweet moments, at least a few scenes of Rhysand being his lovable cinnamon roll self, and a completely expected but adorable turn of events for their little family.Shadows different from anything my powers summoned, spoke to. Born in a lightless, airless prison meant to break him. Instead, he had learned its language.Feysand obsession aside, I loved how much time we got to spend with Cass and Az, learning more about their respective histories and how they’ve healed from the war. With Cassian’s perspectives especially, it felt like this was written to be a legitimate “bridge” between the ACOTAR series and whatever comes next, which I was honestly fond of, even if the next book’s focus on Cassian and Nesta does have me pretty nervous.Lucien had not come here to make amends during Solstice, I realized as Tamlin opened the door to the dark library. Lucien had come here out of pity. Mercy.Perhaps the most unexpected bits were the ones in which we visited Tamlin—with a novella this short, I honestly didn’t expect to see him at all, and certainly not in the state in which Rhysand found him. I never thought I would feel sorry for him, and I still think he’s a walking, talking garbage can, but I still couldn’t help being at least a little bit sad to see how far he’s fallen. I truly do hope that Sarah will write more about him in the future, because I can’t help but always feel that, no matter what a jerk he is, there’s something interesting about his potential as a character.Cassian set me down at last. “What’d you get me for Solstice?” I smacked his arm. “A heaping pile of shut the hell up.”Was ACOFAS everything I hoped and dreamed it would be? Honestly, no. This is more of a 4.5 rating, but you can believe that I did not hesitate to round up to 5 stars, because at the end of the day, I got to spend a few hundred pages with my precious bat babies, and watch this adorable little family interact and taunt and fuss and cry and laugh with one another, and that was all I reallyneededthis novella to offer me. I have missed the inner court so damn much since ACOWAR ended, and it just felt SO GOOD to fall right back into this world for a little bit longer. ♥Bonus list of tiny things that made me squeal:→ the sauna scene→ snowball fight traditions→ more “the power of art” scenes→ Morrigan reminiscing (ow, my heart)→ Amren’s newfound jigsaw puzzle obsession→ “Illyrian babies”→ Rhys cooking Tamlin dinner, like… what even?→ all the fuzzy scarves and winter holiday vibes→ Amren receiving a million pieces of jewelry as always→ Mor’s terrible taste in gifts→ SHAMELESS reference to Cass’ wingspanYou can find this review and more on myblog, or you can follow me ontwitter,bookstagram, orfacebook!'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Just published my latestBookTube Video- so excited to share it!!The Written Review*cue the undiluted screams of joy*Okay. Okay. I willtryto be objective about this one but I just finished ACOWAR and I am still riding that emotional high.To summarize:for a companion novel - not bad at all. It's full ofcotton-candy fluff,and I devoured every single bite.Now, this one was a bitheavy on the smutand a bit light on the Nessian but it definitely hadall the right feelsin all the right places.Stars flickered around us, sweet darkness sweeping in. As if we were the only souls in a galaxy.For those who don't know (and are curious) this novel sprang from avery drunk conversationbetween Sarah J. Maas (aka the Maaster) and her publisher.Maas confessed that in her free time that she wrote fanfiction of her work. Just little drabbles of what happened in between ACOWAR and her next novel. The publisher thought,we could sell that...And thus, this novel was born.So, keeping the origins in mind,I really liked this novel.There wasn't a big-bad or end-of-the-world subplot, not much plot development happened BUT this was afun and lightheartedread.And honestly, after ACOWAR, these charactersdeservea fewmonthsyears off from the doom-and-gloom.“Dangerous words, Rhysand,” Amren warned, strutting through the door, nearly swallowed up by the enormous white fur coat she wore. Only her chin-length dark hair and solid silver eyes were visible above the collar. She looked—“You look like an angry snowball,” Cassian said.Feyre and friends are spending theirfirst winter solstice(aka Christmas without Christ) together. And despite the warmth of the hearth, not all of the winter chill is kept out.Feyre frets aboutreuniting her family.Rhysand freaksout about what to buy her (Solstice and birthday presents!!).Mor isabsolutely terribleat expressing her feelings (and gift-giving in general).And Amren makes outlike a bandit(mostly cause everyone knows what to buy her - priceless jewels).And, of course,Nesta being Nestamade this novel shine.Every time she and Cassian are in the same room the dynamic between them is just perfect.He'd seen Nesta in that particular pose, too. He called it her I Will Slay My Enemies pose.Cassian had named about two dozen poses for Nesta at this point. Ranging from I Will Eat Your Eyes for Breakfast to I Don't Want Cassian to Know I'm Reading Smut. The latter was his particular favorite.I know this is just a companion novel and that there won't be much development in terms of relationships but c'mon Sarah J. Maas.Throw us a bone.(Actually, if you read the sneak peek at book 4 included at the end, I suppose she does offer us a bit of relationship hints).I am soemotionally investedin this series right now. I wish I could just time-machine myself into next year for book 4. But until I get that working, this companion novel will certainly tide me over.P.s. I got to read the hand-stamped version of Sarah J. Maas's book. All I could think of the whole time was -ohmygosh.

But if you read this just as an epilogue to the ACOTAR trilogy, it\'s just pointless and cringy fan service. If I have to read the words ""illyrian babies"" one more time it will actually induce vomiting.-----Original review, May 2018:we were all played like a violin in investing in this book. It’s $18 for lazy, messy fanfiction. This is 200+ pages of complete emptiness. There’s no purpose to any of this other than a money grab and longwinded, unnecessary epilogue to the original trilogy.This literally reads like someone from Tumblr wanted a scene with all the ACOTAR characters having christmas together so sarah whipped out her laptop. There was no substance or set-up to a new series at all. 90% of this book—and I wish I was kidding—is just the characters all going shopping for each other\'s presents--multiple times. The other 10% is Feyre and Rhys speaking in each other’s heads through the bond about how much they want to fuck each other. Additional scenes include the characters getting drunk every 30 pages, weird side POVs from characters who add nothing to the story, and a snowball fight between warriors. I honest to God am not joking when I say if I read this on fanfiction.net, I would laugh at it and say it’s unrealistic and poorly done. It’s just pure stupidity and vapid smut for the fans’ wish fulfillment.The writing in this is so messy. “Gentlemales” brought me to a depth of hell I haven’t seen before, so thanks for that, Sarah. Every time a female character says something “softly, but not weakly,” I feel like plunging a knife into my chest. Take a shot every time Sarah’s written that into one of her books. The sex scenes have so much potential to be steamy or whatever but Sarah ruins it by having the characters CONSTANTLY horny for each other, so it dampens any tension or angst. And the amount of times that sex is referenced in Rhys’s POV is utterly repulsive. At one point he justlooksat a table and is like “mmm I’d fuck Feyre on that” ... [john mulaney voice] FUCKING WHAT?? Even in Feyre’s POV when I could get away from his gross thoughts, he’d always talk shit to her down the bond and try and get in her pants or say something “sexy” but it’s just so corny and stupid and gross and it ruins the scene and I wanted to throw my book it was so irritating.I just think it’s funny how Feyre is the high lady and in Velaris, apparently women—oh, i’m sorry, FEMALES—are toootally equal to men *ahhem* males, and yet this entire book, Rhys is traveling to different courts and talking treaties and strategies with people and going off on business and Feyre does what? Cleans their home, goes shopping (no less than 4 times), cooks meals, and maybe if she’s feeling frisky, paints a little or has sex with her husband—oh, i’m sorry *ahhem*mate…. Sarah, don’t pretend that women are so equal to men but then literally only have female characters who love jewels and shopping and cooking and serving men and having sex. Even Amren didn’t slit a throat in this—she just complained about pooping and then had sex with Varian. Nesta and Lucien are the only vaguely interesting characters in this and I don’t like either of them. Their anger and distance made them more interesting than the characters in this getting shit-faced, making lame sexual jokes to each other, and referencing characters from the original trilogy I don’t care about.I wanted there to be something good about this because I genuinely loved ACOMAF and I’m waiting to feel a glimpse of the mastery that went into that book, but these new books just fan wish fulfillment at this point. This book was COMPLETELY unnecessary and the fact that Sarah is only extending the world to exploit the characters people like and get more money is just low. Let this series die, the world is done. The characters have exhausted their arcs and their humor is dumb and dry.Gave this book a star because Azriel deserves better than this bullshit.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Ok, it\'s time for an unpopular opinion. I\'m sure I\'ll get nasty-grammed all the way until next year for this but.....I didn\'t enjoy this. Not in the slightest.Granted, this is all opinion based; there\'s nothing inherently wrong with this book, I just found myself bored from beginning to end. In fact, I felt like the chapter excerpt for book #4 in the back had more to offer than this entire ""novella"" provided in 220+ pages. If you loved this one, I truly am happy for you, but I felt the need to provide some honest feedback in case there are others who may have the same expectations that I did here. I\'m going to keep this as spoiler free as possible, but if you haven\'t read the previous books in the series I would stop here.********************I\'m actually having trouble writing anything about the plot because nothing really happens in the story, aside from one decision that is made between Feyre and Rhysand. I did appreciate that the author was trying to offer a brief entrance back into the world she had created, and if this had been the beginning to a larger, 700+ page novel then I would have looked at this in a completely different light. I hate that I was expecting something to happen because it detracted from my ability to just enjoy being with these characters again as they shop for presents for each other and describe the food they are eating and recap everything we just read in the previous novel. But truly, if all you are looking for is atmosphere then you will likely enjoy this much more than I did. The descriptions of Velaris and the Illyrian war camps are breathtaking and exquisite.I did wholly appreciate the bit of backstory we get into Cassian initially, and my heart bled for Mor as she kept having to deal with her father and Eris and the Court of Nightmares, but every time I thought we were finally getting somewhere it would switch back over to shopping and food discussions. So I have to give credit to the fact that I was engaged in those moments, regardless of how the flow affected my absorption of the story. I was so disappointed in this disjointed lack of connection that I couldn\'t believe I was reading about the same inner circle I had once held so dear.Have I possible ""outgrown"" this series? I would hope not, because it\'s one of my favorite escapes, so I\'ve come to the conclusion that a big factor is this:I\'m tired of Feyre and Rhysand.It\'s not like I never want to hear about them, but I am so done with their narrative. It has come to the point where it feels repetitive and stale and dull and every single other character in this book, aside from a little bit of Cassian/Mor/Nesta was mostly left out. I wanted to hear more from all these other characters, from other courts spread across the continent, fromANYTHING BUT FEYRE AND RHYS.You know what I think the strongest point this novella has going for it?SJM actually made me feel a bit of conflicted sorrow for Tam Tam.I will never excuse abuse or the things he did wrong previously, but she managed to touch a tiny place inside my heart that wished for more for ole Tammy, that he could find someone to accept his brokenness and help heal him into a functioning member of fae society.I\'m sorry as I\'m completely aware that this review is just a bundle of disjointed thoughts (how\'s that for irony?), but it\'s the best I could do under the circumstances. Guys, I\'ll still read the next book, as I\'m interested in the Nesta/Cassian deal, but I sincerely hope that we see more Elain/Lucien/Azriel, because I missed my precious babies. I really did.Ok, NOW you can throw your pitchforks and knives at me, I\'m done!;)'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Rereading this again filled me up with all kinds of warmth and goodness. I adore this family.——————————That motherfuckin wall scene!I mean, what are words at this point when it comes to Sarah J Maas's books?! She's my favourite author. Her books have brought about this sense of utter calm and happiness within me every time I read and think about them.This novella was everything we needed to potentially see the direction the other books will go in. And boy, am I beyond excited for it!I'm sure we'll be getting more of Cassian and Nesta in the next book and Sarah J Maas does character development ridiculously well and my god, being able to look forward and dream about their character exploration makes me too excited for words.I loved that we got see more of the Inner Circle. They are, hands down, my favourite bunch of fictional characters. I feel like I'm part of the family. I'm so glad some lighthearted, happy and sweet, tender moments were included in this. The family aspect between them all felt too real, and so good to read. And so worthy of them to have after the events of ACOWAR.And the emphasis on art in this book and seeing Feyre getting back into it as a form of healing for herself and others was a dream. Her dreams were finally actualised.The progression from ACOWAR to this felt natural and the cities and its people (including our main lot) were still healing, still too traumatised from the war. But progress was being made and I can't wait to see how that will be looked at in the upcoming spin-off series.I think at this point people are more interested in the progression of other characters.

I know many people weren\'t happy about getting another book about them but they still hold a special place in my heart soa new whole canon book about them?It felt like Christmas morning for me lol.Besides that, from my point of view the book is more aboutseeing the inner circle heal after the warthan feysand. Some dealt with it better than others but everyone has its own scars.I loved seeingthe progression of Feyre and Rhysand\'s relationship,they\'re my all time favorite fictional couple and seeing them happy and making plans for the future was amazing, after everything they went through they deserve it and no one can convince me otherwise. Plus, it was good to seeold Rhyscoming back, he was kind of less funny and flirty in acowar (understandably).It\'s true,the plot was basically non existent but I mean ... uhm what were you expecting?I lost count of how many times Sarah said the whole book\'s purpose was giving a deserved ending to the feysand arc and creating a bridge between the two series. That\'s exactly what she did so I don\'t get the amount of hate I\'m reading about this topic.Plus, the final excerpt confirmed thatthe next book is gonna be nessian\'sand I liked how Sarah set up the two of them (especially Nesta, her story arc in acofas is soooo dark).

But how are they going to find that information when so many booktubers, common sense media and Goodreads members are hiding it?You can also find the information about the erotic content of this series on the american hardcover version of a court of mist and fury.Pages 21, 22A faery woman is descriptively fingered by someone different than the hero, then she has descriptive sex, then oral, descriptions of the fluids and the nudity and the action in vivid detail.Pages 471, 472, 473, 474. 475A faery woman is fingered to orgasm by the hero (different guy from the pages 21-22), partial nudity, but this scene takes a quite few pages and it\'s an erotic scene, not just a sex scenes, but the purpose seems to be to be to turn on the reader.Pages 530, 531, 532, 533, the orgasm that shatters the mountains:a pair of lovers heroine and hero have sex including oral, vidid description of the action, use of the word ""cock""Pages 538 and 539vivid descrption of oral (fellatio):P but they call it licking LOL.DISCLAIMER AND TRIGGERS WARNINGS:♣ IF YOU DON\'T LIKE READING EROTIC/EXPLICIT CONTENT and don\'t tell me that you can skip the sex scenes, Most of us don\'t pay full hardcover price for skiping half the book ;)kidding, only A COURT OF MIST AND FURY book two is really erotica marketed as YA, the rest of the series is still explicit but not erotic♣ IF YOU THINK YOUNG ADULT IS A GENRE THAT SHOULD REMAIN CLEAN♣ IF YOU ARE 12-17 YO WHO DON\'T LIKE TO READ EXPLICIT SEX SCENES♣ IF YOU DON\'T LIKE LOVE TRIANGLES And MULTIPLE MALE LOVE INTERESTSBook 1 we have a love triangle: Tamlin vs Rhysand(there was a third male who Feyre was sleeping with, but it was just a fuck buddy who was engaged to marry OW)> winner: TamlinBook 2 We have a love triangle: Rhysand vs. Tamlin but it\'s really unevenfor a while it seems as though another high lord might create a love geometry but didn\'t happen. EXPLICIT SEX SCENES of heroine with both love interests: winner RhysandBook 3: NO LOVE TRIANGLE!Feyre and Rhys remain together, but there are other love triangles around and Rhys proposes a Male-Male-Female threesome to Feyre. Maybe he was joking, either way her reaction was unnecessarily enthusiastic for a woman who has already been sexually involved with 3 different men in the series and who is basically a newlywed. FeyRhys is still in their honeymoon period so why are they already joking about threesomes?♣ IF YOU DON\'T LIKE ABUSIVE LOVE INTERESTS AND ABUSIVE WOMEN-Tamlin love interest of book 1? ABUSIVE!-Rhys, secondary love interest of book 1 andprimary love interest of books 2 and 3? Rhys tortured the heroine(there was a reason, though)ABUSIVE!- The sisters? Everyone talks about how Tamlin should apologize. When will the sisters apologize?Feyre\'s elder sisters let Feyre hunt for the family from a very early age, but they were always there reaping the benefits of Feyre\'s effort. When Feyre was going through an abusive relationship they kept receiving money from Feyre\'s abuser and didn\'t bother to find out how she wasABUSIVE!♣IF YOU DON\'T LIKE WHEN sexual assault victims ARE THROWN UNDER THE BUS TO MOVE THE PLOT FORWARD. CAREFUL WITH DANGEROUS RAPE MESSAGESIt happens so much on New adult and adult literature (game of thrones, the girl with the dragon tatoo, the second book of the outlander series) a sexual assault victim gets the ""oh-you-were-raped?- don\'t- bitch- about- it- and- move- forward treatment. So many books trivialize the worst aspect of PTSD and sexual assault and try to ""sovle it"" either with revenge or the magic romantic relationship that will make everything go away. Or the experiences just get ignored and brush aside! This happens to Mor, a secondary character in the 3rd book who is a rape survivor whenshe\'s forced to work along with her attacker and the one who puts her through that was the hero of the story!To be fair, I can understand the circumstances, doesn\'t mean I have to like that kind of story line, especially when that\'s something that good editing could have taken care of. That kind of disrespect for rape was unneccessary IMO. It didn\'t move the plot forward and it\'s out of character for Rhys to act like that. I love Rhys and didn\'t like the way SJM made him act.♣ IF YOU BELIEVE ANY BOOK YOU PAY FOR SHOULD BE PROFESSIONALLY EDITEDI\'m not a grammar nazi and my spelling is terrible, but I can tell you, even some fanfiction I\'ve read has a more polished editing than this book. There\'s the overuse of words like mate. There are also problems with pace, repetitiveness, flow and consistency of the voices when changing from a narrator to the other and from a first person POV to a 3rd person POV. The characters sound too modern. The worldbuilding is not high fantasy at all. The setting of this series is pretty much like a modern series. All these are things that a content editor and a proofreader could have taken care off, but the publishers rushed publication lowering the quality of the editing and the writing. Even so they are selling this at full ebook price.My ratings for the series so far♣A Court of Thorns and Roses ACOTAR 3/5because abusive relationships, false advertising (it\'s new adult dishonestly marketed as young adult) and love triangle. My review is currently censored and hidden from the third page of review. It should appear somewhere between page 2 and 3.♣A COURT OF MIST AND FURY ACOMAF4/5 because I didn\'t appreciate the explicit sex scene with OM, but I highly recommend this book to my friends who don\'t mind safety issues and like explicit scenes in slow-burn-romance. This book is EROTICA (according to the goodreads description of the genre) marketed as YA.♣A COURT OF WINGS AND RUIN ACOWAR2.5/5 because poor editing, f bombs, repetitiveness, unnecessary sex scenes and dangerous messages. No, glorifying revenge and abusive women isn\'t female empowerment. No, in most marriage it isn\'t always the woman\'s choice, it\'s always the choice of both of them. My review is currently censored by goodreads.Sources of my pictures:AMAZON CANADA CHILDREN\'S BOOKS ADVENTUREAMAZON CANADA CHILDREN\'S BOOKS FANTASYAMAZON AUSTRALIA CHILDREN\'S BOOKS LOVEBooktopia A COURT OF MIST AND FURY RECOMMENDED AGESEROTICA GENRE DEFINITION ACCORDING TO GOODREADSACOMAF RECOMMENDED TO CHILDREN 11-13 on audibleWHY YOU SHOULDN\'T TRUST BOOKTUBERS AND THE YA GOODREADS CHOICE AWARDS REGARDNG THE CONTENT OF THIS BOOK?Because a vast majority of booktubers have failed so far to mention that this book series contains erotic/explicit content in their booktube reviews even though they always discuss ""young adult books"". It could be unintentionally. It could be intentionally. The reason doesn\'t matter. They\'re contributing to the false advertising.A fewbooktubers are being published or aspire to be published by the same IMPRINT of this new adult series. Others booktubers and bookbloggers seem to want good relationships with the publishing industry. They won\'t say anything that can hurt the marketing agenda of the big publishing houses.Note: Bookables, Benji Alderson and Polandbananas have mentioned this series is new adult , so of course a lot of booktubers are somehow honest, it\'s not cool calling out an entire community of readers because the dishonesty of a few bad apples. Distrust only the reviewers who call this series young adult.On the other hand, The Goodreads choice awards editors ignored the shelving system when they selected the categories for the goodreads choice awards last year. In the goodreads feedback group they told me that\'s how editors select categories: based on shelving.At the time of the awards this series was shelved primarily asfantasy and romanceby GR users, but still the editors made it compete on the young adult category. Not in romance (second most-shelved genre), not in fantasy (first most-shelved genre). They made it compete in young adult (third most-shelved genre followed closely by New adult)This review isn\'t meant to discouraging people from reading/buying the book. On the contrary. I\'m inviting you to read this series if you don\'t have problems with sexual content and abusive relationships.Despite all the problems I have with the false advertising I enjoyed the trilogy. But again I\'m warning you:♣ NEVER trust the information that you see on Goodreads, Common sense media. and booktube. Not all reviewers are independent and unbiased. Do your research.Life is too short and TBR piles are too big to just ignore the kind of information that can help us decide what we will read next. Goodreads shouldn\'t try to hide that information.People who pay $15-18 for a hardcover and $8-15 for an ebook of a young adult ""high fantas"" book have every right to expect:♣ 12-18 YO Main characters,♣ no F bombs♣ no explicit sex.♣ A profesionally edited book.That\'s not what any book of this series delivers.Update 02-24People aren\'t expecting something like this:For a series that is supposedly about women\'s choices,when Goodreads, Booktubers and Publishers hide this information from young girls they are taking away their right to decide when or if they would read erotic content. Not to mention they\'re contributing to the book being sold in the Children\'s section of multiple retailers.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""the snowball fight?? The solstice gifts??

This is the equivalent of a fluffy fanfic with no plot. Honestly, the plot of this series wasn\'t great in the first place, so ACOFAS is basically what happens when SJM makes the good decision to scrap the plot and just focus on the part I actually care about - the characters.This novella is infamous for, uh...My reviews are rated G, thank you very much.Let\'s just say... stuff happened in the sky.I had nearly sent us crashing into the rooftops like an Illyrian whelp.If you listen carefully, you can hear my wheezing.But that\'s not the main problem I had with this, even though it was, well - a littlestrange.I hate the treatment of Tamlin.I hate it so much.In case you somehow have no idea what Tamlin did in ACOMAF, here\'s a summary.He locked Feyre in the house and emotionally abused her. It was bad.But Rhys was such a jerk about it when it wasFeyre\'sresponsibility to talk to him.Rhys just assumed that what he said was what Feyre wanted. He was needlessly cruel to someone who was suffering from PTSD.Tamlin\'s mental illness doesn\'t give him an excuse, obviously, but I\'m still angry that Tamlin didn\'t get the help he needed. He was traumatized, scarred; but everyone focused on Feyre, leaving him to become the person he is now - broken, depressed, scared. Believing he is only worthy of hate.Look at how jerky Rhys the Beast is being literally after Tamlin saved his life:No, Tamlin deserved what he\'d brought upon himself, this husk of a life. He deserved every empty room, every snarl of thorns, every meal he had to hunt for himself.That makes me sad. That actually makes me physically upset. No one deserves that. No one. And it\'s not even Rhys\'s place to say this stuff to Tamlin:""You deserve everything that has befallen you. You deserve this pathetic, empty house, your ravaged lands. I don\'t care if you offered that kernel of life to save me, I don\'t care if you still love my mate. I don\'t care that you saved her from Hybern, or a thousand enemies before that.I hope you live the rest of your miserable life alone here.""WHOA.CALM DOWN.Look at how depressed poor Tammy is:Tamlin didn\'t have shields around the house. None to prevent anyone from winnowing in, to guard against enemies appearing in his bedroom and slitting his throat.It was almost as if he was waiting for someone to do it.Let\'s be clear - I don\'t like Tamlin. He\'s a manipulative jerk. But he needs help. He clearly needs someone to take care of him like Rhys did for Feyre in ACOMAF. And he was not given that, so everyone hates him because of it.This also ruined Lucien\'s life. Now he\'s not welcome anywhere. And he says it like it is:""You can be as much of an asshole as that mate of yours, you know that?""I mean, he\'s not wrong.My other big complaint with this novella is the random ""feminist"" stuff that\'s thrown in so awkwardly? We get it, males can cook and clean. It\'s not that revolutionary. It should have been incorporated better into the story, rather than stated outright....cooking, cleaning, child-rearing, clothes-making... There was honor in such tasks - pride and good work to be found in them. But not when every single one of the females here was expected to do it... Traditions going back thousands of years, left mostly unchallenged.Until us. Until now.Rhysand is such a Feminist King™I appreciate what this is trying to do, but it\'s so cheesy that... I really can\'t, I\'m sorry.""The boys can help decorate, clean, and cook. They\'ve got two hands.""Wow, Cassian\'s a Feminist King™ too.Added to the random tragic backstories that strangers confessed to Feyre at the oddest times, this novella felt rather weak.Oh, yes, they wererandomall right.""My husband didn\'t return from the war.""Miss Girl, Feyre does not know you.Oh, and here was an absolutely stunning analogy that just... shook me to the core.This same random weaver person had a tapestry and she explained that the black thread was called the Void and that the white thread was called Hope. And then...""If I were to stop, if I were to let this loom or the spindle go silent... Then there would be no Hope shining in the Void.""Wow, so the Hope thread symbolizes hope and the Void thread symbolizes emptiness!!!Speaking of on-the-nose, Feyre has a weird relationship with money. As she reminds us, over and over and over again:The sums we allocated were sizable, more money than I\'d ever dreamed of possessing.This would be okay if it were only said once. But no.It didn\'t feel real, those numbers and figures. Like it was children\'s play money. I only bought what I needed.She says this so. many. times. Basically every time she buys something.Decadent - it felt decadent, and selfish, to shop.I didn\'t like how the side characters developed (besides Nesta, her trauma was just haunting). No one forgives Nesta for making Feyre hunt before Prythian, and yet everyone forgives Elain when she did the same thing. It doesn\'t make sense. There\'s no explanation.""You still can barely talk to Nesta,"" I said. ""Yet Elain you can talk to nicely.""""Elain is Elain.""""If you blame one, you have to blame the other.""""No, I don\'t. Elain is Elain.""What kind of explanation is that? ""Elain is Elain."" And? Are we supposed to forgiveherinstead of Nesta because she\'s so gentle and kind and sweet and blah blah blah? I don\'t think so.My theory is that Elain is not actually nice. She only speaks maybe 2-5 times during this novella, and most of the time, she\'s speaking coldly. Everyone is surprised, but... This is just how she is. She takes advantage of her family and friends thinking she\'s weak and needs protecting. But she\'s actually just a colder person than Nesta.Elain\'s voice was colder than usual.I\'d never heard Elain\'s voice so cold.Also, what is Feyre painting? No one knows. This entire novella is about her painting and I literally still don\'t know what she\'s painting.""What sort of things do you paint?""""The things that need telling.""How very descriptive.I painted and painted and painted.I painted until my back cramped... I\'d known what needed to come out of me the moment I perched on the rickety stool...But it began to emerge. Began to take form.I lowered my brush and stared at what I\'d created.Me.Or how I\'d been in the Ouroboros, that beast of scale and claw and darkness; rage and joy and cold. All of me. What lurked beneath my skin.But...But what is it??I painted through the grief that lingered at the weaver\'s story, painted for her loss. I painted all that rose within me, letting the past bleed onto the canvas, a blessed relief with each stroke of my brush.I still don\'t know.I hadn\'t any idea what to get them, other than this. The [paintings] I\'d worked on recently - glimpses of their stories. None of them explained what the paintings meant, what they beheld.Imagine knowing what Feyre is painting.For on that painting I\'d shown him what I had not revealed to anyone. The creature inside myself, the creature full of hate and regret and love and sacrifice, the creature that could be cruel and brave, sorrowful and joyous.I\'ll leave you with that mystery to figure out. If anyone knows what Feyre\'s painting, tell me and I will thank you profusely.1.5 stars; the word ""mate"" was used 71 times. this is not Australia, thank you'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3/5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️“Stars flickered around us, sweet darkness sweeping in. As if we were the only souls in a galaxy.”I\'m sorry. I\'m so fucking sorry.THIS BOOK FUCKING KILLED ME WITH BOREDOM. I swear to God, I\'m dead now. My ghost is writing this review. I\'m fucking dead because this book had no point in even existing. This book isn\'t even filler. It\'s nothing. I can\'t even describe it. This book was SUPPOSED to be the bridge between the old series and the new series. But like??? This book was just messy archiveofourown.org fanfiction. And not a good one. Not one I would give kudos to or write a comment under. One I wouldn\'t read at all. But now let\'s go to the summary of the book, which is also inadequate.Feyre, Rhys, and their close-knit circle of friends are still busy rebuilding the Night Court and the vastly-changed world beyond. But Winter Solstice is finally near, and with it, a hard-earned reprieve.Yet even the festive atmosphere can\'t keep the shadows of the past from looming. As Feyre navigates her first Winter Solstice as High Lady, she finds that those dearest to her have more wounds than she anticipated--scars that will have far-reaching impact on the future of their Court.See? Even the summary has nothing to prepare us for. As you all know, because I\'ve been raving and raving about those books for a million years, this is the series which has reintroduced me to fantasy. This series holds a very special place in my heart and I have come to loveSarah J. Maasas an author, too. This book was unlike anything she has written. This book was clearly a money grab, fanservice sort of fanfiction book. Which added almost nothing to this series. Everything that happened in this book could be included in a 30 page snippet at the beginning of the fourth book of the series, and it would all be ok. But let\'s talk specifics.The plotLet\'s talk about the non-existentPLOT. This book was: shopping with Feyre, shopping with Mor, cooking with Elain, hardcore negotiations with Rhys, Az and Cassian, some good ol\' fucking with good ol\' Feyre and Rhys, and then again shopping, and then again some fucking, and some tension featuring Nesta,ARTwith Feyre, brooding with Tamlin, sexual tension with Cassian and Nesta, and let\'s not forget the epic new single....MATES, included in the new album byFeyre ArcheronandRhysand(who still doesn\'t have a surname)M.A.T.E.S.(masturbation anal testicles ejaculation sex) (wtf was that). Let\'s be real here. Every time I read this fucking word I want to off myself. This word is ruined for me. I can never hear a dudebro call another dudebro ""mate"" and not remember this. Let this word rest. Let this word die. Let this word becomeFrost and Starlight(see what I did there). JUST LET THIS WORD GO. WE KNOW THEY\'RE MATES THEY\'RE MATED FOR LIFE THEY\'LL BE TOGETHER FOREVER AND FOREVER NAH NAH NAH. Ugh. If I had one euro (yes I\'m changing it from ""if I had a dollar"" if I had a fucking dollar I couldn\'t use it for anything) for every time the word ""mate"" is in this book, I would go to vacation to Santorini. It\'s expensive guys. You have no fucking clue how much.The POVsThis book added multiple perspectives of characters, which I found pretty interesting, but also unnecessary because nothing happens in this book and we don\'t need to see that nothing explained from multiple people, but you know, it happens. It confused me, though. We mostly see Feyre\'s and Rhys\'s POVs, in first person, and then we see some more characters\' POVs like Cassian and Mor but... in third person. Which is really unsettling and baffling. And those chapters are such heartwreching and heartbreaking moments from their past, and in this book, it feels our of place. A book about the Winter Solstice which is basically Christmas, shopping, gifts exchanging, happy times, scenes like these seem unnecessary. I couldn\'t take them seriously, and I wanted to. Also, it seems like we\'re gonna get the next series with third person narration. Which is fine by me, but what\'s the point?The romanceI\'m not a big fan of established and domestic relationships. Feyre and Rhysand literally murdered me in ACOMAF. The sexual tension, the eye fucking, the actual fucking, the ""things"" before the actual fucking, they made my little shipper heart die with happiness. And then... they became so canon, it hurts my soul. They don\'t interest me anymore. It\'s all sex and fucking and ""oh mate, my mate"" and ""oh how much I love you my Feyre"" and sky sex which was disturbing and like??? People can see you dude! You can fucking winnow and fly, just get her on a bed, or a wall (lol) or a sink or whatever floats your boat. I believe these characters\'s circle is over now. I\'m truly excited for them to have a child but I guess we\'ll see everything from another people\'s POVs now. It\'s time now forCASSIAN AND NESTA. Oh man, how much I ship this. I\'m so fucking board for this. They are my new Feyre and Rhys. I want this to happen so badly, I want to scream. Nesta pissed me off a lot in this book, but I will handle her for this ship. And because Cassian obviously loves her and I love Cassian with my entire soul. Furthermore, I don\'t know what to do with Elain, in terms of shipping. Az and Elain are cute af but I kinda want to explore the whole Elain and Lucien factor. Elain pisses me off, but I love Az and Lucien and I want to see them happy.TamlinThis book made Tamlin an unnecessary villain. It\'s like this book didn\'t have a plot or anything or someone to blame shit on so just blame it all on Tamlin. Don\'t get me wrong, I fucking hate his guts. I appreciated what he did in ACOWAR, he kinda redeemed himself, but I still don\'t like him. Nonetheless, there is no point in what\'s happening to him. Everyone is casting him out. He doesn\'t have any friends, his home is a graveyard, his people hate him. And you know, he isn\'t the worst. We\'ve seen worst villains redeem themselves. He\'s just a controlling and manipulative asshole who can\'t control his temper. He didn\'t hurt Feyre or Rhys. I want to see what will happen to his character, but Sarah has villainized him too much.The humorThis book was funny af. Hence my rating. The Amren peeing scene, the sauna scene, the ""Illyrian babies"" scene, the painting Rhys nude scene, the Feyre and Cassian drunkly decorating scene, the gifts exchange scene. It was all hilarious and fluffy and happy and it\'s something I needed. I have come to love these characters so much and I feel their inner circle as my home. I was truly happy to see them domestic and healing their wounds after the war. But, nonetheless, there was not a book needed for this. All these scenes could have been included in the fourth book. But, you know, money is important.Basically, this book was a character driven tease which gave us nothing! Honestly, we see things beginning and then we are given NOTHING. I want to know, I want to know everything. This book was diverse to anything Sarah has ever written. I was expecting this BOOM to happen but nothing. A big huge pile of shit and nothing. The book fourth snippet at the end was the most interesting part of this book. We kinda see what the next series is gonna be about. But still, not ENOUGH. Honestly, people, don\'t pay money for this book. It was too expensive for its size and importance. This is why I never read novellas and extra books to series. They mostly add nothing to the story. ANYWAY, till the next book in the A Court of Thorns and Roses series, which will be late af, K BYE!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is a great catch with the main heroes of the series. The last book was an all-out epic. This one, though a lot shorter, is still filed with SJM’s great storytelling and character development.So far, I have seen all these characters in the worst possible situations and facing incredible odds. Making great sacrifices and the legendary lengths they would go through to achieve their goals and protect those they love. Now, when they have “won”, the work of rebuilding, forgiveness, and moving on from the losses suffered.Yes there is no where near as much action in this book, and the characters are not moved along as much as I would have wanted but the are definitely important issues uncovered her that need to be explored later. This is more of “wet the appetite” for the next huge chapter, but almost as importantly a much need to assess where the characters are right now in themselves and to each other.Though Feyre and Rhysand embrace their fate together. Others rebel against a fate they have not chosen with their very souls. These are the first steps in building a new world. A great point to catch up with everyone as they set their path for the future, to forget their past, or simply (stubbornly) deny fates chosen path.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'First, technically speaking, why was this book necessary? What was the plot?Was thereeven a plot? SJM said this novella is a bridge between Feysand’s story and the next story in this world, but what exactly did it bridge?All I got from this book is anger and a gag reflex.If you’ve seen my ratings, updates, or followed me at all on here, you know I wasobsessedwith ACOMAF. It was all I talked about for about a year, from the moment I read it.I basically hated the other two books, but I loved the second one, and got so attached to feysand.But, good god, it is justnot possiblethat the person who wrote ACOMAF is the same one who wrote ACOWAR&ACOFAS. (Yes I’m hinting at a conspiracy theory).Like, ACOWAR was bad, but I still had some attachments to Feysand, even though Rhys was kind of a douche even then.But this? This wasbad.let me just saythis book is not a fantasy book. It’s a contemporary set in a different world. no fantastic elements other than flying (and even that was only mentioned for the purpose of a sex scene) were present in this book.Feyre didn’t use her powers even once. You’d think she’d use this time to practice and perfect her abilities, but no. She might as well be human.Butwhat annoyed me most about this book (and ACOWAR too tbh) is the complete regression of the characters.Feyre went back to roaming around the house doing nothing all day, Mor isstillhiding herself for no apparent reason— homophobia is not even a thing in this world and even if it were we all know the Inner Circle would accept her no matter what, so what’s the point?, Nesta went back to her old self (though I kind of get that), Amren lost all her strength and fierceness and just sits around doing jigsaw puzzles, and Rhys, oh god, Rhys. HOW IN THE WORLD is this sleazy, sex crazed douchebag supposed to be the same loving, caring, supportive Rhysand from ACOMAF? He couldn’t gotwo sentenceswithout making some unnecessary innuendos, talking about how good Feyre feels, how he can’t stand being around her without fucking her or how he dicked her in the sky while flying (???).His entire first chapter in this was him sulking and whining because he doesn’t get to fuck Feyre daily.*insert the world’s smallest violin*But putting that aside, let’s talk about how “”feminist”” he is.(I just wanna note that I know I still loved Rhys (less, but still loved him) after ACOWAR even though all those issues were present there too. It was just a little more subtle and I was still on that Feysand rush since I’d read ACOMAF only a month before. Now enough time has passed and ACOFAS has really solidified Rhys’ problematic behavior in my mind and I can see it for what it truly is.)In ACOMAF, he said [about Feyre]”My equal in every way; she would wear my crown, sit on a throne beside mine.Never sidelined, never designated to breeding and parties and child-rearing.My queen.”(page 621).And what do you know, in ACOFAS she isconstantlysidelined,andtrying for a child.In fact, the beginning of this bookreallyparallels the beginning of ACOMAF. I mean, yeah, Feyre’s in a better mental state for sure, but she still sits around the house being bored, or painting, or designing a house, while Rhysand is out there dealing with all the politics. Direct quotes from the book-”perhaps I’d use the day to organize things. Find room for everything.““High Lady of the Night Court, Defender of the Rainbow and the … Desk.”[Rhys walks in while Feyre’s in bed] “Right where I left you”... “Isn’t it all I’m good for?”Like, are you fucking kidding me? Yeah, you crowned her High Lady, but the reality is that you never involve her in anything big. You just have her clean and do some paperwork. She’s a housewife. That’ssoooofeminist of you! High Lord of the Feminist Court!Basically,Sarah J Maas made Rhys such a supporter of women in ACOMAF to make the difference between Tamlin and him even clearer, and once we all switched to Rhys’ side she figured she could just drop the act.Well, I got some news for you Sarah. It doesn’t work that way. Your readers aren’t dumb.And also, can we talk about the whole period thing? It was really cool to see such an open discussion about it in a book (no sarcasm this time) but... the idea that it makes women completely incompetent? Not so much. And that cheesy scene of him stroking her hair while she’s in pain? I almost puked.Oh and for god’s sake don’t get me started on the sisters!!!First of all- Leave! Nesta! Alone!She’s been traumatized, and she doesn’t wanna be around the Inner Circle because it’s a constant reminder of what she’d gone through. Feyre of all people should know what that feels like. But no, she keeps pressuring her and practically blackmailing her so she would come.And Cassian chasing her down her street even though she asked him to leave her alone multiple times.These people can’t respect a woman’s simple request for privacy. but hey, they have a High Lady! Yay Feminism!And I am just disgusted by how Elain is treated in this book.She is constantly pressured by Feyre to give Lucien a chance even though she repeatedly and explicitly says she’s not interested. But Feyre doesn’t let up because he’s a “good male”.Again, Feyre is such a feminist Icon!Not to mention how much Elain is belittled and ridiculed in this. She may be naive, but she’s not dumb! she’s not a child! They all (excluding Azriel, the only pure soul in this mess) keep treating and speaking to her like she’s a four year old!!!I have more thoughts but I’m so angry that I can’t even make them into a coherent sentence and this is getting too long anyway, so the bottom line is, I only care about Azriel now, but even if there’s a book about him, count me out because I’m done. I’m just done with Sarah J. Maas books.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3.5 StarsSo...I\'m not in a reviewing mood at ALL; but I figured I better lay something down here before I completely forget any thoughts I have about this book and my experience reading it.I had a hard time rating this.Because, well, it just didn\'t blow my mind.That said.While I didn\'t love it...While I didn\'t really, really, reallylikeit per se...I didappreciateit.And here\'s why.Prior to receiving my copy in the mail and, obviously, reading the book, I received Maas\' subscriber newsletter email. In it she had the usual ""woo hoo, it\'s release day"" fodder they all send out, but it also contained - what I would later discover upon finishing the book - was exactly what was depicted in the ""Acknowledgements"" section.In it, she talked about the process of writing this book and how hard it was because, in the midst of it, her father had a major health scare and almost died. Still, despite this trying time - she also found out she was pregnant - and, despite not really always ""feelin\' it,"" Maas trudged through the writing process because DEADLINE.As someone who loves to write and also lost a parent in the past, I just really empathized with the creative struggle Maas probably had here.Now, am I saying that an author\'s personal life issues should be taken into account when rating/reviewing or considering your own enjoyment of a book?Hell no.Of course not.Absolutely not.I\'m just saying that, FOR ME, reading about that just changed the mindset I started the book with.I went in knowing that, by her own admission, Maas struggled writing it.So I guess you could say that 1) lowered my expectations bar, and 2) made me read the book knowing Maas had been experiencing personal pain while writing it.And I think that emotion was definitely captured in the story.This book will NOT blow your mind.It does NOT really move the plot forward.But what it did do, in my opinion, was move the CHARACTERS forward.It really drilled down into a lot of their inner thoughts and longstanding issues and baggage and - as someone who loves character driven stories - I really enjoyed that aspect of the book.Also, I mentioned this in a status update while reading, but for some reason, I am REALLY intrigued by Nesta\'s character.She was totally selfish in book one and has continued to be heinously bitchy throughout the series, but there is just something about her strength, stubbornness, and just plain fucking resolve that I love. For whatever reason, I am just sometimes drawn to complex, fucked up, misunderstood female characters that everyone else hates. And I can\'t WAIT for the next book.In fact, I think the character development done in this book is going to act as a veritable buttress to the next books in the series and make them even better for its existence, as meh as it might have been plot/action-wise.So yeah, I guess I had more to say than I thought. LOL Oh well.Toodles!P.S. I thought I\'d share the cool exclusive edition ends papers for anyone who hasn\'t seen them...'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""edit 2/21: still a waste of time but felt like i needed a refresh before ACOSF... prolly didn’t need to bother but it wasn’t that awful-------------------------------------and to think, i was so excited for this onednf @ like page 50. this just wasn't good & when i saw the second novella was announced my eyes rolled back in my head so far i saw fucking stars. i'll give you some unneeded backstory since i don't have much to say about content:i started this series before i started reviewing on goodreads. i devoured the first 2 books back to back in college and was pretty in love. at the time, i hadn't been reading hardly anything because college but after reading the first 2 i got back into reading and back into fantasy. so i will always be grateful for that, but i also think that colored my judgment of the series.when you've never had chocolate before, a hersheys bar tastes pretty fcking good. and when you haven't read fantasy in a while, SJM books seem pretty goodthese books really aren't that bad but they aren't really that good either. and SJM's bloated continuation of series is kind of getting on my last nerve. no one wanted 2 novellas. no one really wanted this series to continue beyond the first 3 books. sure we love the gang but could you just start a new series? your pregnancy shouldn't be an excuse for a shitty novella.i'm rambling. whatever. i'm selling this book.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Nothing happened in this I love it though'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '❄ DASHING THROUGH PRYTHIAN ❄❄ ON TAMLIN\'S FUCKING FACE ❄❄ OVER THE HILLS THEY GO ❄❄FUCKINGALL THE WAY ❄no kidding❄ FEYRE\'S BOUT TO STRIP ❄❄ MAKING HYBERN SHINE ❄❄ OH WHAT FUN IS TO WEEP AND CRINGE ❄❄ AT SARAH\'S CHEEZY LINES ❄❄ JINGLE BELLS ❄❄ CAULDRON YELLS: ""OH BOY, THIS WAS LAME"" ❄❄CHRISTMASSOLSTICE SHOPPING ❄❄ & FEYSAND SMUTTING ❄❄BUT NESTA SAVES THE DAY!!! ❄'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Real Rating: 2.5This book made me realize that I am more interested in the characters that are not in the inner circle like Lucien, Tamlin, Viviane, Kallias and even Eris (I’m really intrigued by him). Anytime those people were mentioned, my interest in the book rose. Unfortunately, since they are indeed not part of the inner circle, their presence in this was either non-existent or minuscule.This book was said to bridge the gap between what happened in previous books and the next ones. I somewhat agree that there is a sense of direction as to what the next book is going to be about but most of what happened in this had no bearing on that. Honestly, I believe this novella wasn’t necessary and SJM should have written a full book. This book had so many unnecessary fillers.What to expect- Feyre shopping- Feyre and Rhysand having dirty thoughts about themselves all the time/doing dirty things to themselves. The sex scenes/thoughts in this series used to give me anxiety because I did not want to read about that but in this, it was just annoying and old- Feyre painting- Feyre being sad that she was rich- Rhysand being ‘perfect’- To mix things up: Illyrian drama, Tamlin being sad, Nesta being annoying.Things I liked- My kind, loyal Lucien: I loved reading about him (mostly from other people talking about him) and I loved his brief appearance.- I liked reading about Tamlin even though it was mostly depressing. I have a feeling his situation is going to change soon.- I think among the inner circle, Azriel is my favourite and I loved reading about him. I’m curious about his shadows.- I like Eris… I don’t know why, I tried not to but I can’t help it. I think there is more to him than meets the eye.- I liked Feyre when she was not with/thinking about Rhysand. She’s actually a really nice and caring person.Now to get to some details- I know ACOTAR was beauty and the beast retelling but Tamlin in this gave me 'pre-belle' beast vibe with how lonely and depressing him and his court is. So hopefully, his belle would come soon 💕- I honestly don’t think Feyre did that much damage in the spring court to warrant the current state- I used the ship Nesta with Cassian like most people do but while reading this, I realized that I only shipped them because of the tension they have together. I used to like Nesta because I found her intriguing but she was so annoying in this and I honestly don’t know why Cassian still likes her. He deserves better and I honestly started shipping him with that girl at the shop smh- I also used to Ship Elain with Lucien but she’s so rude to him. No one is saying you have to be with him but at least be nice. He also deserves better- I don’t ship Azriel with Elain because their relationship gives me family vibe and not romantic. Especially with the comment about his mother- I still can’t believe Mor hasn’t told Azriel the truth..Until she does that, I don’t think I can like her.- I’m tired of being sad for Lucien. I really hope in the next books, we see him being happyOverall, if you’re a Feysand fan, you’ll probably really like this but I’m not so it was eh.This book wasn't worth my excitement and not just because Lucien was there for like 2 pagesP.Sare we ever going to know how rhysand became the most powerful high lord in history? or at least how that was provenPre-readingThis comes in exactly 2 weeks.

",Christina Lauren,4.24,674175,1232,"Romance, Contemporary, Fiction, Contemporary Romance, Audiobook, Adult, Chick Lit",432,10-04-2018,"The story of the heart can never be unwritten.Macy Sorensen is settling into an ambitious if emotionally tepid routine: work hard as a new pediatrics resident, plan her wedding to an older, financially secure man, keep her head down and heart tucked away.But when she runs into Elliot Petropoulos—the first and only love of her life—the careful bubble she’s constructed begins to dissolve. Once upon a time, Elliot was Macy’s entire world—growing from her gangly bookish friend into the man who coaxed her heart open again after the loss of her mother...only to break it on the very night he declared his love for her.Told in alternating timelines between Then and Now, teenage Elliot and Macy grow from friends to much more—spending weekends and lazy summers together in a house outside of San Francisco devouring books, sharing favorite words, and talking through their growing pains and triumphs. As adults, they have become strangers to one another until their chance reunion. Although their memories are obscured by the agony of what happened that night so many years ago, Elliot will come to understand the truth behind Macy’s decade-long silence, and will have to overcome the past and himself to revive her faith in the possibility of an all-consuming love.Love, loss, friendship, and the betrayals of the past all collide in this first fiction novel fromNew York Timesand #1 international bestselling author Christina Lauren (Autoboyography, Dating You / Hating You).","[{'rating': 2, 'content': ""no review, no rating, have a nice dayfine i liedme from two days ago: yooooooooo!!! this is kinda painful????? the heartbreak??? the angst??? could this be… a new favourite?????me now:lol, anyway.my favourite thing about reading this were my updates for the first 60% where I was clearly enjoying myself and all of you commenting like “you don’t like it? ☹️“ “why don’t you like it, Jonathan ☹️”, “please don’t write a mean review, Jonathan, this is my comfort book ☹️”I literally thought I would rate it at least 4 stars at that point, probably more, so idk if you and me were seeing the same updates.Anyway, y’all clearly jinxed this for me, so don’t complain about what’s to come.idk what to think about this. I very much enjoyed it for the first like 60%.I am a big fan of second chance romance because there is just so much opportunity forpain✨. second chance romance always has so much angst and it’s justchef’s kiss. big love. we all know I only read to experiencepain✨ andangst✨ because my own life isn’t anxiety inducing enough. hahaha. just kidding, I had like seven panic attacks today.and this one totally delivered on the pain and angst and anxiety at first and then the tables kinda tabled and now I just don’t even know what I’m feeling anymore.those two got kinda… annoying after a while.(there will beSPOILERS)in the past chapters Macy just kept going on about Elliot’s dick and constantly dreaming about “what’s behind his zipper” and she would NOT SHUT UP ABOUT IT. there is only so much I can take. find another thing to obsess over. or at least use a different phrasing?? idk.she was just too horny for her own good and, I’m gonna be honest with you, reading about two seventeen year olds fucking is not really my idea of a good time.and her being like “oh you can go in raw, my dad put me on birth control :)” cool cool cool. kids use condoms please.in the present chapters those two just refused to talk to each other about things that mattered. they hadn’t seen each other in 11 years and were like “let’s not mention what kept us apart for that long for like another six months, for dramatic effect”they just kept going on like “oh we’ll talk next month about this”, “oh let’s talk next week”even during their super emotional (not really super emotional because they obviously had to have sex outside before this and were talking about half of the things that kept them apart while Elliot still had his dick inside her, which was very awkward because at one point he was like “I never wanted to be inside another woman, only in you” and then they made me believe he actually cheated on her, but we’ll get to that. anyway, fantastic conversation to have while his limp dick is still inside “lmao, remember when you thought I slept with another girl and then didn’t talk to me for 11 years? what do you mean there’s actually more?”)even during that Macy is like “let’s talk tomorrow” NO BITCH JUST FUCKING HAVE THIS CONVERSATION NOW, MY DAYS ON THIS PLANET ARE LIMITED, YOU ARE WASTING MY TIME.and then she actually left??? we really had to drag this drama out, huhevery normal person would have been like “oh yeah my dad died exactly on the day I stopped talking to you” the moment he brought her dad up (on like the first day of meeting again).honestly, they could have resolved this even faster. she wasn’t even mad about him “cheating” on her, she just said she was very depressed about her dad. I get it, but Elliot was allegedly your soulmate and your rock and the only one you ever trusted, and you really didn’t even want his support? he reached out multiple times? idk. the drama was dragged out so much that you'd think Elliot literally stabbed her dad himself.everything about his could have been resolved fifteen years ago. even though it was only eleven since it happened.I also did not appreciate the author trying to sell what was a very obvious r*pe situation as Elliot cheating on Macy (accidentally). he was very drunk and passed out and he thought he was sleeping with Macy, meanwhile Emma just took advantage of him. he even admitted to being afraid of intimacy many years down the line but that was just shrugged off. who cares about male r*pe victims, am I right fellas.idk. I’m really disappointed in this one as it showed promise in the beginning. 2 stars? 2.5 stars? 3 stars? 1 star?

If you know me, you knowI LOVE Christina Lauren, I consider them one of my favorite authors, but this book was just someh.This is their first""women\'s fiction""novel, even though I don\'t know how this is different from a new adult romance.This story follows Macy and Elliot, who met when they were kids. The story alternates chapters between when they were kids and now, years later when they are both adults. Macy\'s Mom died when she was a kid, and her Dad got them a ""getaway"" house at the lake, and they moved in next door to Elliot\'s family. This house has a special closet that\'s like a mini-library and they spend most of their summers and weekends reading in there together. In the present chapters, Macy and Elliot haven\'t spoken inyearsand now Macy is a nurse and she is engaged to this guy who has a daughter that she\'s only known for six months. Macy runs into Elliot randomly again and she gets blasted with feelings for Elliot and questions whether she really wants to marry Sean.I think my main problem with this book is that I didn\'t like Macy or Elliot as characters.They were both impulsive and annoying, and irritating to read about. I liked their reading closet and how they both loved books, but that\'s literally theonlything I liked about this story. They spent most of their teenage years talking about kissing and sex and masturbating and \'omg who are you dating?\' and \'do you have a girlfriend?\' and \'omg why aren\'t we together???\' and I just got annoyed really fast. And then don\'t even get me started on the adult Macy and Elliot. I know I wasn\'t going to like this book from the momentElliot just decided to dump his girlfriend after talking to Macy again for only a few minutes! Like are you for real??? That\'s ridiculous.Elliot in general just bothered me and I couldn\'t figure out exactly why.Their romance was so bland and forgettable.I still love Christina Lauren, and I\'m still going to read everything they publish in the future, but this book was a major disappointment.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'BRUV WTF !?!? HOLY SHIT THE THIS BOOK WAS SO GOOD!!ok y’all i’m telling you, childhood best friends to lovers to second chance romance to lovers is such an under appreciated trope!! fuck !! i loved this book !it was so beautifully written, it felt very lyrical, and vivid. perhaps my favorite part about this book was how the writing-only being in one POV- still kept me engaged and engrossed. the detail and scene building was down flawlessly, at times my heart was racing.i was on the edge of my seat wishing the best for these characters. i love how the authors connected the dots together at the end. really made it full circle. shit like that makes me all giddy and giggly inside. istg i love it so much.these characters deserve the WORLD!!! bro!! fucking Elliot was such a beautifully written character. and the chemistry between Macy and Elliott was tangible since the first day they met.some parts were predictable and some parts came out of nowhere. but i ended the book was the biggest smile on my face. these characters have king heart ❤️'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'its been said that beautiful things dont ask for attention. and oh, how humbly beautiful this book is.it is also simple, but its an elegant simplicity. the story itself isnt flashy; it doesnt rely on gimmicks or beg for the reader to notice it. it is just a quiet story about boy and a girl who grew up to love each other.a book like this deserves a thousand word review, but all i have to say is how grateful i am that stories like this have been written - stories that create an honest moment of beauty and love - and make the world just a little bit better, just a little bit more lovely.↠5 stars'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '4.5I loved this.

The story was compelling enough to keep me reading quickly, though in hindsight the characters themselves were kind of...bland. I wanted to like Elliott more than I did, as he was a sweetheart, but something was just missing for me. But I really wanted to know the twist/conflict that led to the 11-year radio silence between the two MCs.About 90% in we finally get there, and it is...super problematic.Elliott was raped. He was pass-out drunk, and a girl takes advantage of him in that state. This is the scene Macey happens upon, of course, and she runs out devastated, having caught her boyfriend passed out half-naked with another girl. Okay. Understandable to an extent for her to freak out, not really knowing the situation. And then the thing with her dad, and everything is super traumatic. Okay. It\'s a bit obnoxious as a trope that a character decides to shut down and just stop communicating entirely with another character, especially for over a decade, so that the other character (and the readers) just never know what\'s up. It can be done to serve the plot, I get it, even though I find it annoying.Except, no one ever addresses the fact that Elliott was raped. The authors and both the characters keep referring to it as a ""mistake"" he made, and they still label it as him cheating. A drunken mistake. Except he was drunk enough to have passed out. So drunk he thinks it\'s his girlfriend fucking him, not another girl. So drunk he still has no idea what happened the next day. I could understand a couple 18-year-olds not having the language or the knowledge to fully understand what happened to him. I could understand Macey blaming him at the time. But I was hoping at nearly 30, both characters would have been able to better address the situation and the reality of what happened to him. So I\'m incredibly disappointed, and also kinda pissed, that that doesn\'t happen. In fact, once this whole twist is out, it\'s handled very quickly and wrapped up in another chapter or two. I was left feeling like--wait, wait, there is SO MUCH to unpack here! Elliott should be angrier, to be honest. I got whiplash from his sudden cold shoulder after their sex scene at the wedding to chasing her down at her dad\'s house to learning why Macey shut him out. This story just needed to be teased out a bit more after that point. A lot of the chapters prior to that point could have been cut or condensed, honestly, because they added little to the plot and really only delayed the real conflict and messiness of their relationship.Also the Sean and Phoebe story line was dropped rather abruptly. I guess I imagine there\'d be more drama when breaking up with a guy and his 6-year-old daughter, I don\'t know. Especially when that daughter already lost a mother.

Why two people who are crazy in love ruined everything? Why any of them tried to make things right? And now, what’s gonna happen? Will Macy forgive Elliot and learn to trust him again? Will Elliot do something to take this girl back? Macy knows he is her destiny, he is her person. She didn’t love anybody even her fiancée as much as she loved him!Oh boy!

As an advocate of romances with possessive alpha males, love at first sight, strong held friendships that lead to a romantic affair (in the good way), and finding an ending that doesn\'t lead you to questioning what happens next,I can declare this new CLo book a masterpiece that is no surprise to me will become a hitfor many who adore their writing.➳The emotional side of CLo has one hundred percent shown in this new novel, and to many may enjoy it, but it is indeed aromance that no one should pass along and forget about. It comforts you, it soothes you, it gravitates towards you to continue and enjoy the chemistry that Elliot and Macy have. The messages of the lose, the gain, and the remembrance of familyis one that certainly makes you stop and think about what you truly have and the who are the people that surround and care for you. Personally, I have taken my family for granted for so many years, but with thepresence of this novel I have succumbed to the realization that family will always be there, through the thick and thin, the enjoyable times and downfall times, and the confusing and understandable times, family will always be there to show us how love truly enhances in an individual.➳Overall, thisfictional romance novel that has gained so much of my respect this year and has become one of my favoritescan officially be declared as a unique story that so many should read. Those who are fans ofChristina Laurenand for those who are not but still rehash to the romance genre,Love and Other Wordsis a story filled with unique and unforgettable moments. Thank you to my favorite publishers at Gallery Books for providing an early copy that I will forever take advantage of re-reading over and over again.➳ARC kindly provided by Gallery Books in exchange for an honest review...➳Follow Me On:Blog♕Instagram♕Facebook♕Twitter'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '★ 4 stars""I love you, and I lust you and I want you. I love you as the person I want to be with forever.""I love this book. I\'m in love with this book. I dreamt about this book last night. You\'re probably thinking, well why didn\'t you give it 5 stars? Unfortunately, I can\'t tell you why without spoiling so I\'ve included aspoiler warningtowards the end of the review with the reason. The rest of the review is spoiler free.❥The PlotLove and Other Wordsfollows Macy Sorensen\'s POV as she navigates life from her early teenage years up until adulthood. Macy lost her mother to cancer at 10 years old and is finding her way through this grief and the reality of being a young girl growing up without a mum with a father who is trying his best, but can\'t replace the female figure she lost. When life got too much, Macy\'s mother wanted her to have an escape, so her father purchased a holiday property where she could recharge. At 13 years old, she then meets her new next-door neighbour, Elliot Petropoulos.Macy\'s story is told in dual timelines which alternate from 15 years prior to present. The flashbacks gradually give you a glimpse into Macy and Elliot\'s childhood bond from 15 years prior up until 11 years prior when they stopped speaking. Flashback to current time, they run into each other after 11 years apart and you begin to see their story unfold.❥Tropes➸ Friends to lovers➸ Childhood firsts➸ Second chance romance╰⪼ThoughtsThis book made me feel like a teenager again, giddy and falling in love. I was kicking my feet and squealing watching these two in the flashbacks fall in love with each other in their awkward years. Every little girl needs an Elliot in their life,I can only imagine what adult life would look like for women if all of our first loves were like this one. Elliot was wise beyond his years at just 14 years old up until 18, when it was then cut back to present time. He was beacon for Macy and filled the void in every way that her father couldn\'t.I loved theirsecret reading closet, where they escaped and shared their love for books.Their exchange of impromptue favourite wordswas touching as they used this as a way to speak with each other when they were too young to understand to voice how they were really feeling. Elliot also didn\'t shy away from topics most boys his age would be insecure about as he understood how hard it must be to be in Macy\'s position without her mother. Theirrawnessandhonestywas beautiful.I thoughtthe lettersher mother left her were stunning, she truly did think of everything and I can only imagine how hard to read but precious those words would have been when Macy needed them through each milestone as became a woman.In present tensewe learn in the first chapter that Macy is engaged to Sean and is a paediatric doctor when she runs into Elliot for the first time. I liked Sean to begin with but as we learned more about their relationship this changed. I think this relationship sentan important messageabout trauma bonding and how sometimes we are just passengers in our life, following a routine, moving through motions but not actually feeling and living.As the story unfolds in present tense we watch Elliot and Macy reconnect as friends but they share such a deep connection that it can never be just friends. He sees right through Macy\'s denial and isn\'t afraid to be honest with her about it. I loved how they communicated so effortlessly on hard topics and how Macy reflected on her choices without getting defensive. I was flying through this book at the end as the tension was building and we were starting to find out what happened to pull them apart.""I never got to fall out of love. I just had to move on.""The EndingThis bookwas5 stars for me upuntil the last 40 pageswhich makes me so sad to write, but the event was significant enough that I had to reduce a star. I don\'t have it in me to lower it anymore than that because of how much I loved the other 90% of the book.**SPOILER WARNING**---I didn\'t like how the book dealt with Elliot\'s assault. There\'s nothing else to call it than that. The author left things intentionally vague on the details, we didn\'t get a deep conversation about it. Elliot didn\'t express how he felt about it but there was enough of an allusion that he was sexually assaulted. When he later described his next sexual experience after this and broke down in hysterics it made me feel physically ill. I just wish there was a few extra chapters dedicated to Elliot\'s trauma before it was wrapped up because it was entirely skipped over and the word \'cheating\' was still being thrown around. This discussion would have added a lot more depth to the story.---**END OF SPOILER**Overall, I fell in love with Christina\'s storytelling and beautiful writing, it captured the essence of grief, first loves and heartbreak perfectly. I love the characters she created with all my heart, this book is just truly so beautiful. I haven\'t felt this way about a contemporary romance for a long time and despite my qualm,I encourage everyone to pick this up off the shelf if you\'ve been putting this off.❥Quotes""Do you think of her in this room?

This book is pure bliss on so many levels.

While they have their flaws, they are both likable and I loved reading about Elliot and Macy’s friendship and how they came to fall in love. There is also a level of emotional intensity that I was not expecting. While there is a happy ending, there are some unexpected tragedies.I was obsessed while reading this and I had to force myself to put it down!

I just love when a book reminds me of how single I am in every page. Truthfully, Elliot is like top 5 book boyfriends of all time; he is perfect. And Macy is a pretty relatable MC. I also enjoy the format of the book, how the chapters alternate from past to present. Nothing really major or shocking happens (veryyyy slow burn, but satisfactory), but it is such a cute read that I couldn’t put down!! The whole thing just feels very intimate, and you can feel the passion emanating from the words. Amazing.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'What is your favorite word?Love and Other words is a second chance love story told in alternating timelines about two people who met and fell in love while growing up and then re-met eleven years later. Macy and Elliot met during an open house when Macy found Elliot reading a book in a closet. Macy\'s father purchased this second home for them after his wife (Macy\'s mother) passed away. Macy and her father would go to their cabin home on weekends and spend their summers there. Since the day they first met, when she was 13 and he was 14, Macy and Elliot bonded over their love of books and became best friends who fell in love during their teenage years. They could talk about anything and shared a very close bond. Then their relationship ended, and they had not seen or spoken to each other in eleven years. Then the two meet accidentally in a coffee shop, eleven years later. and the spark is still there. There is a complication of course, isn\'t there always with romance books - and yes, this is a romance book and a coming of age story rolled into one -even if it is classified as something else.I enjoyed this book from the get-go even though it looks as if it took me 5 days to read. I started this book and had to finish other reading obligations but then tore through this one yesterday. This book is very easy to become absorbed in. I literally could not put this book down. I really enjoyed both characters and really rooted for them, wanting desperately to know what tore them apart eleven years ago.Love and other words is an easy fast read which sucked me in. There was a time or two while reading this book that I wanted to shake both characters - one more than the other. I enjoyed reading about their friendship when they were younger where it was evident that both wanted to be more than friends and the reader could see them flirting with the idea and watch them get close then retreat, get close, hint around at it, then retreat, until finally they became a couple and then.... READ THE BOOK!There is a bit of a reveal which I have mixed feelings about. I can\'t go into detail, so I won’t give any spoilers away, but I thought ""you have got to be kidding me"" and ""seriously, come on"". Grrr In some ways this felt cliched but it was successful in making me feel several emotions – just as the characters felt several emotions as well.This is the type of book that can easily be read in one day! It pulls at the heartstrings and delivers! I could feel their friendship, their angst, their chemistry, the love, the heartbreak, the spark, the re-connection. While reading this book I felt as if I were on this emotional journey with Macy and Elliot.Thank you to Simon and Schuster who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest reviewSee more of my reviews atwww.openbookpost.com'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I'm sleeping on the highway tonight""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""i just finished this and it's 2 a.m. and i cried significantlyfor some reason this book made it to the list of books i've owned the longest that I haven't yet read.

I’ve seen some reviews saying that Macey shouldn’t have forgiven him but honestly, all i felt was that Elliot should’ve been given more time to digest the reason why she left him all those years ago. Bc like it or not,technicallyhe did a play a factor to why Macy’s dad got into an accident and died. But i get it, it’s notentirelyhis fault.I totally 💯% understand why Macey left him with a long-decade of silence bc by the time she realized that he deserves a chance to explain himself and that the supposedly ‘cheating’ thing was small compared to the accident, she didn’t know how to reach out to him and was afraid to face the past that wounded her deeply.""I wasn’t thinking clearly—after—I wasn’t able to separate—you. And it.""Ok now, did Elliot reallycheaton her?I guess that depends on ones perspective of the situation.Personally, i don’t think so bc he was shitface drunk with disappointment that Macey didn’t give an assuring response to his proposal and didn’t say she loved him back. He already explained that he thought that Emma was her when he slept with Emma (sounds shitty, i know but if you reaLLYknowElliot and where his mind and heart is solely at, you’d believe him too bc he. would.never.my KING? cheating?! nu\'uh, never!\' ""I was so drunk, Mace. I remember touching your hair, talking to you, encouraging. And when I look back, I still see your face when she climbed on me.""....I remembered what Brandon started to say, something about how Elliotwouldn’t. \'EDIT❗️:A wonderful friend of mine here on GR,Juliahave pointed out something really important on this \'cheating\' matter and i feel like it\'s important for others to understand this and see the logic from this perspective because Elliotdid notcheat. Instead,he was taken advantage of by Emma when he was vulnerable and not sober. Can you imagine if roles were reversed and it was Macey who was in his position? Do you think it\'d be fair to say that she cheated on Elliot? Would you say she \'cheated\' if she were so drunk and got approached by a guy who manipulated her into thinking that he\'s her boyfriend, then proceeded to take full advantage of her?Think about it. Just bc Eliot\'s a dude doesn\'t mean he\'s any less of a victim in this situation.Anyway~On my2nd reread, i read the book following itstimeline chronologically; starting with all the ‘Then’ chapters first and then moved to the ‘Now’ chapters. Ergo the5+ stars.Rereading it this way really helped me to understand why Christina Lauren wrote the ‘reveal’ scene and left the ending the way that they did. I was able to feel the 11 years of lost time and detachment when they bumped into each other at the cafe— The decade of silence suddenly became deafening, the buried disappointments and sadness immediately felt heavier. Only then was I able to understand more on how Elliot was able move on from the past without holding any grudges against Macey for the lost time and welcomed her back into his life with opened arms.It also helped me to separate the overload cuteness from the ‘Then’ chapters and the ‘Now’ chapters which are more focused on regrets and longing for one another.So i\'d highly recommend any of you torereadthis following its timeline chronologically, if you ever plan to*****************************EDIT(24/12)since i’m tooyoung, dumb and broke~to treat myself on my birthday 🤠 i knowonething that can leave me beaming and heart swelling for the entire freaking day—rereading myultimatefave book of ALL.

The way he was always there for Macy and really listened to what her mom wrote down on that note was so wholesome.

He even kept the same phone number for 12 years so that if she ever called he could pick up. He has never ever been ashamed of his love for her and that's what I admire and love the most about him. Also the younger him was so adorable🥺“I'm sorry. I'm nervous.”The way he flushed when he was nervous around Macy was so cute🤧.

We started off on the wrong foot since I didn't really like her in the beginning. But this really has changed throughout the book. She has really grown on me. She was a bit too harsh on Elliot sometimes, but after seeing what she has been through that changed, It still doesn't justify how she acted towards him but now I know why she did the thing she did. Also she was so sweet for staying with Sean just because of his little daughter, somewhere she wanted to give the girl a mother figure, because she didn't want her to feel the way she felt herself.

Pride & Prejudice
",Jane Austen,4.29,4423497,1231,"Fiction, Historical Fiction, Historical, Literature, Audiobook, Novels, Historical Romance",400,28-01-1813,"Pride and Prejudice has charmed generations of readers for more than two centuries. Jane Austen's much-adapted novel is famed for its witty, spirited heroine, sensational romances, and deft remarks on the triumphs and pitfalls of social convention. Author Jane Austen (1775-1817) was an English novelist whose works of social realism achieved unprecedented critical and popular success, though Austen herself remained an anonymous writer throughout her life.","[{'rating': 4, 'content': '➸4 stars“i cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation. it is too long ago. i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun.”— pride and prejudice by jane austen stands as a pinnacle of english literature, enchanting readers for over two centuries with its timeless tale of love, societal expectations, and personal growth. set in the genteel world of regency-era england, the story follows the spirited elizabeth bennet as she navigates the complexities of courtship, marriage, and social hierarchy. central to the story is elizabeth’s tempestuous relationship with the brooding and enigmatic mr. darcy, whose initial aloofness belies a depth of character and integrity that gradually wins elizabeth’s heart.one of my resolutions this year was to step out of my comfort zone and explore classic literature, and since i absolutely adore pride and prejudice (2005), i decided to start with this book. after reading this story, i can now comprehend why “pride and prejudice” has captured the hearts of so many over the years with its wit, social insight and timeless romance makes it a captivating read. i’m not sure why it wasn’t a 5 star read for me, but i think that the slow start made it a bit challenging, it was until volume three where i started to really enjoy the story.➷ austen’s language was, at first, bit of a challenge. while her prose is beautiful and rich, sometimes i would have to go back to reread a chapter to understand what was happening. but that’s just a me issue since i’m not really used to reading classics and i had to keep reminding myself this book was written over 200 years ago. but as the story progresses you can see how the writing is eloquently beautiful. watching the 2005 movie so many times definitely helped me understand everything better.“a lady’s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.”➳elizabeth bennett:elizabeth is such a strong fmc. she takes no nonsense from anyone and isn’t afraid to speak her mind. what makes elizabeth captivating is her unwavering sense of integrity and her refusal to compromise her principles, even in the face of pressure from her family and society. she is not willing to settle for a loveless marriage or a life of luxury if it means sacrificing her own happiness and autonomy. throughout the story, elizabeth faces numerous challenges and obstacles, from her family’s financial struggles to the pressures of societal expectations. yet, she navigates these difficulties with grace and resilience, never compromising her principles or sacrificing her sense of self. she had a tendency to be judgemental throughout the book. she quickly forms opinions about people based on limited information or first impressions. for example, she initially perceives mr. darcy as proud and arrogant, partly influenced by negative rumours that mr. wickham told her. but as the story goes on, she learns that maybe she shouldn’t be so quick to judge.— i absolutely adored her relationship with her sister, jane. they both share a special sisterly bond that is central to the story. throughout the book, they confide in each other, offer advice, and provide emotional comfort during times of joy and distress. their tight-knit bond stands as a testament to the enduring power of family, providing unwavering support and understanding. together, they navigate the complexities of society and matters of the heart, offering each other comfort and guidance along the way.➳fitzwilliam darcy:「”dearest and loveliest elizabeth”」opposite elizabeth bennet stands the brooding and enigmatic mr. darcy, a wealthy and reserved gentleman hailing from a noble lineage. initially shrouded in arrogance and reserve, darcy’s facade belies a depth of character and integrity that gradually unfolds throughout the narrative. at the beginning of the story, he is seen as arrogant and dismissive, particularly in his interactions with the bennet family. his reluctance to engage in social situations and his propensity to make quick judgments about others contribute to his unfavorable reputation. while undeniably flawed, darcy’s journey is marked by a profound transformation—one of the most compelling arcs in the story. despite his pride and acute awareness of social status, darcy emerges as a fundamentally good man, grappling with his own prejudices and ultimately learning to open his heart to love. through his struggles and growth, darcy embodies the novel’s central themes of self-discovery, redemption, and the transformative power of genuine connection.꒰mr. darcy + elizabeth:꒱they are the true heart of this story. the romance between mr. darcy and elizabeth bennet is a slow-burn journey that unfolds gradually throughout this book. at the outset, elizabeth is put off by darcy’s perceived arrogance and social status, while darcy is equally dismissive of elizabeth’s lower social standing and outspokenness. darcy’s letter to lizzy is a pivotal moment that shifts the dynamics of their relationship. it’s a sincere attempt by darcy to address the misunderstandings between them and explain his actions. through the letter, darcy opens up about his past and motivations, revealing a more complex and vulnerable side of himself. for lizzy, it’s a moment of reckoning, as she grapples with the new insights into darcy’s character and her own feelings towards him.darcy: i love you even though you’re poor, your family have no etiquette and they suck, but idc will you marry me??lizzy: nolike this will never not be funny!! she left that man flabbergasted, like what did he expect her to say after just insulting her and her family 😭”in vain i have struggled. it will not do. my feelings will not be repressed. you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you.”— overall, this book remains a timeless classic, cherished for it’s witty dialogue, memorable characters and enduring themes. it’s not just a romance but also a sharp critique of societal norms and expectations. through the journey of characters like elizabeth bennet and mr. darcy, jane austen offers timeless lessons about prejudice, self-discovery, personal growth and the power of love. it’s a book that is still adored and continues to resonate with readers generations later.───♡─────────────in my classics era'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '""I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.""Some of my happiest, and most looked-forward-to days of the year are the ones that I reserve for the re-reading of Pride and Prejudice. To quote Austen herself from Sense and Sensibility: ‘if a book is well written, I always find it too short,’ explains perfectly how I feel about this book; no wonder she called this ‘my own darling child,’ for, for me, P&P is perfect in every conceivable way. It’s the kind of book, the moment you finished reading, you are tempted to start over again immediately. However, reviewing this is another matter… I’m excited, enraptured, but at the same time agitated, knowing that it’s impossible to do justice to the author nor to the book.""But such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.""During my first reading of Pride and Prejudice, I had known I was hugely underqualified to review this book, though at the same time I had hoped, if I read all of her books, I might, in time, write an acceptable review for this masterpiece. Now that I’ve read them all, and also P&P for a second time, all I can say is I still don’t consider myself remotely qualified to write an objective review. But it is impossible not share one’s opinions after reading this: this book, for me, is as best as it could get. So, for the time being, I’ll have to be content with writing what I consider to be a subjective overview, which, I’m certain, does not do much justice. However, I hope that someday my sense in classical literature would become good enough to truly appreciate how remarkable this book is.""You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity.""""Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.""""What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?""Starting with the plot, which has been thoroughly analyzed, criticized, and commented upon by thousands of readers, is surprisingly, at a glance, not that original, especially if you see this as a pure romance novel. True, there are many complications resulting from multiple relationships (or marriages), but overall, there are many similarities. But what makes this special is Austen’s narrative: the sly humor, witty observations, unique lens through which she views the society, and the deeper understanding of morals of characters, are all perfectly concocted using her flawless writing style. And then there’s Elizabeth; aside from inheriting traits like humor and wit from Austen, she is lively, curious, confident, but without becoming ‘too perfect’ (like some of the Austen’s other protagonists). She is as delightful as it could get. Rest of the characters are also similarly entertaining, with each one infused with a myriad of qualities to keep the story interesting. I don’t think there was a single poorly written character in this book, and that’s the first time I’ve ever said that about a book. And I don’t wish a single thing had turned out differently in this story. With the exception of some of the children’s books, that’s also a first for me. Sometimes it’s hard to imagine, that this has been written over 200 years ago, or this ever becoming dated. Unlike with most romance novels, you will not see the reasoning, or common sense become lost in the middle of the story, which I think will help maintain that timelessness.""Affectation of candour is common enough — one meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design — to take the good of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad—belongs to you alone.""This second reading of the book only strengthened above opinions from my first read. If anything, everything felt even clearer, making the reading experience further satisfying. The only minor exception came with Lydia’s plotline. Compared to my opinion from the first reading, where I had been a bit angry with her, that emotion has been somewhat shifted a little towards sympathy this time. Obviously, same couldn’t be said about Wickham though. I also felt like that every single word here is essential during this second read. Although I didn’t skip a single word during the first time, I believe I enjoyed each sentence a lot more this time.""Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.""Until now (that is till I finish my second read), I’ve never watched any of the TV or movie adaptations of Pride and Prejudice. To be honest, I didn’t want to have any negative impact towards the perfect imaginary picture Austen had created. But after this second read, I decided to watch the 2005 movie, the 1995 TV series and the 1980 series, and couldn’t resist sharing some of my thoughts. As much as I appreciate the effort, the 2005 movie did not prove to be a worthy portrayal, at least for me. Maybe it’s the modern characters, or what had to be removed due to time restrictions, or deviations from original book, but at the end of the day, I cannot say I loved it that much. But the 1995 series was quite the surprise! It literally had almost every single dialog from the book, with a few exceptions at the end. It did add up to five and a half hours of play time, but that was totally worth it. If you loved the book, and haven’t watched the series, do watch it immediately. As for the 1980 series, though I loved it a lot, it fell a tiny bit behind the 1995 series. But both those series are commendable portrayals.“Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of humility.""The misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices""As for this review, I’m going to label this as a work in progress, which I’m hoping to update after each re-read.""The distance is nothing when one has a motive;""The happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Old books get a bad rap...but do they deserve it?

Confession...this book gave me anearth-shattering Janeaustegasmand I am feeling a bit spent and vulnerable at the moment, so please bear with me. You see, I decided I wanted to get more literated by reading the ""classicals"" in between my steady flow of science fiction, mystery and horror. The question was where to begin.After sherlocking through my Easton Press collection, I started by pulling out my Dickens and readingA Tale of Two Citieswhich I thought was jaw-dropping AMAZO and left me feeling warm, satisfied and content. It also made me made retrospectively pleased that I named my youngest daughterSydney.After Two City “Tale”ing, I decided to give this book a whirl as I kept seeing it on GR lists of ""goodest books ever."" However, I must admit I was hesitant going in to this for two big reasons. One, I thought it might be a bit too romantical for me. The second, and much more distressing, reason was thatTwilightwas on many of the same lists as this book. Austen fans should pull a nutty over that one.So needless to say I went into this thinking I might hate it. Well, for the 999,987th time in my life (at least according to my wife’s records)...I was wrong!!! I absolutely loved this book and had a mammoth, raging heart-on for it from the opening scene at the breakfast table when Father Witty (Mr. Bennet) is giving sly sarcasm to Mrs. Mommie Put Upon. I literaphorically could not get enough of this story. I was instantly captivated by the characters and Elizabeth Bennet, the main protagonist, immediately became one of my all time favorite characters. Mr. Darcy joined that party as soon as he showed up in the narrative as I thought he was terrific as well.Overall, the writing could not have been better. It was descriptive, lush and brilliant. The story could not have been more engaging or intelligent and the characters could not have been more magnificentastic. Elizabeth and Fitz are both smart, witty, self-confident and good. Austen could not have written them better. Oh, and I am sorry if this is a bit of a minor spoiler but I need to add that George Wickham is a cock-blocking braggadouche of startling proportions. I needed to say that and now I feel better.This one has made it onto my list ofAll Time Favoritenovels and is truly one of the classics that lives up to its billing.A FINAL WORD TO THE GUYS:...Guys, do not fear the Austen...embrace the Austen...HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I am so unqualified to write about this book.I am physically unqualified, because I could write infinite words about how much I love this book, and I type in a weird way that makes my wrists hurt so infinity is simply not going to happen.I am emotionally unqualified, because I lack emotional intelligence when it comes to my own feelings and the idea of trying to explain how I feel about this book is overwhelming.I am spiritually unqualified, because of the aforementioned overwhelmed-ness.I am also unqualified generally, in the grand scheme of things, because so many people have written so intelligently about the wonderfulness of this book and I have nothing better to add.Just more rambling like this.I read a lot of romance, and if you want to venture a theory as to why, I’d love to hear it. I very seldom like it, so maybe it’s a masochist tendency. Maybe I’m a glutton for the attention that writing negative reviews of popular books gives me.

Up until about page one hundred I found this book vexing, frivolous and down right tedious. I now count myself as a convert to the Austen cult.I must confess I have been known to express an antipathy for anything written or set before 1900. I just cannot get down with corsets, outdoor plumbing and buggy rides. Whenever someone dips a quill into an inkwell my eyes glaze over. This is a shortcoming I readily own up to but have no desire to correct. So I admit to not starting this book with the highest of hopes. I did really enjoy Ang Lee\'s ""Sense and Sensibility"" however and so when my friend threw the gauntlet down I dutifully picked it up.Boy did I hate him at first. To get anywhere with this book one has to immerse oneself in the realities of life and marriage in the nineteenth century. At first all this talk of entailment and manners just left me cold. I liked the language to be sure. Austen\'s dialogue is delightful through out but dialogue alone (no matter how delicious) does not a great novel make.A hundred pages or so in though I started to see what a shrewd eye for character this Austen woman had. Mr. Collins was the first person I marvelled at. His character springs forth fully formed as a total but somehow loveable ass. From that point on I found much to love about this book. I was so into it by the end that I was laughing at some characters, sympathizing with others and clucking my tongue at an unhappy few. In short I was completely absorbed.In conclusion I must now count myself a fan of Miss Austen\'s novels (and not just their fim adaptations) and do so look forward to acqauinting myself with more of her work in the future.

Can we all just LOL at my use of the words ""mind-numbing balls""?? HA.This book is quite possibly the most insipid novel I have ever read in my life. Why this book is so highly treasured by society is beyond me. It is 345 pages of nothing. The characters are like wispy shadows of something that could be interesting, the language that could be beautiful ends up becoming difficult to decipher and lead me more than once to skip over entire paragraphs because I became tired of having to stumble through them only to emerge unsatisfied, and the plot is non-existent, as though Austen one day decided she wanted to write a novel and began without having any idea what would happen except that there would be a boy and a girl who seemingly didn’t like each other but in the end got married. The story really probably could have been told in about 8 pages, but Austen makes us slog through 345 pages of mind-numbing balls and dinner-parties.

I had to grow into it, much as I had to grow into my love forMrs. Dalloway. But now that I'm here, I am a full-on fan.Deft is a word that seems to have been created for Austen. She writes deftly, she creates scenes deftly. She isn't, despite being prolix to a fault, at all heavy-handed or nineteenth-century-ish in her long, long, long descriptions. She is the anti-Dickens: Nothing slapdash or gimcrack or brummagem about her prose, oh nay nay nay. Words are deployed, not flung or splodged or simply wasted. The long, long, long sentences and paragraphs aren't meant to be speed-read, which is what most of us do now. They are meant to be savored, to be treated like Louis XIII cognac served in a cut-crystal snifter after a simple sole meunière served withharicots vertsand a perfect ripe peach for dessert.The romantic elements seem, at first blush, a wee tidge trite. And they are. Now. Why are they? Because, when Miss Jane first used them inPride and Prejudice, they worked brilliantly and they continue so to do unto this good day. Why? Because these are real feelings expressed in a real, genuine, heartfelt way, as constrained by the customs of the country and times. And isn't that, in the end, what makes reading books so delicious? I, a fat mean old man with no redeeming graces, a true ignorant lower-class lout of the twenty-first century, am in full contact with the mind, the heart, the emotional core of a lady of slender means born during the reign of George III.You tell me what, on the surface of this earth, is more astonishing, more astounding, more miraculous than that. Jane Austen and I Had A Moment. She's Had A Moment with literally millions of English-speakers for over 200 years. She's had moments with non-English speakers for more than a century. Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy are cultural furniture for a large percentage of the seven billion people on the planet. (Large here is a relative term. Less than one? Still amazing for a book 200 years old.)Reading is traveling in time, in space, but most importantly inside. Inside yourself, inside the characters' emotions, inside the author's head and heart. It is a voyage of discovery, whether you're reading some bizarro mess, Dan Brown's mess, religious tracts,Twilight, whatever. You-the-reader are going somewhere in a more intimate contact than you-the-reader have with any other being on the planet. Movies, TV, sex, none of them take you as deep into the essence of feeling and emotion as reading does. And no, snobs, it does NOT matter if it's well written, it matters that the book speaks to the reader. (Sometimes, of course, what one learns is how very shallow and vapid some people are...I'm lookin' at you, Ms. Fifty Shades.)So I thank that rotten, stinkin' Stephen-the-absent Sullivan, safe in the knowledge he won't see me admitting this, for reminding me to live up to my own goal of remaining open to change.

First off, like P and P, the tootsie roll wasn't one of those dinky ones that you can almost swallow in a single bite so you know that I've been at this for a while and now that I finally got it down, I have to wonder why I put it into mouth to begin with. Secondly, tootsie rolls are a throwback to another age, there are far better candies out there and the 36 wrappers littering the floor will attest to this. You have to really like tootsie rolls to appreciate them. I don't.Pride and Prejudice is the dullest most wonderfully written book that I have ever read.

In the age of bodices, there is nary a one that is ripped open, let alone one that is undone with the gentle exploring fingers of a lover.And then there is the hubbub over the book...Satirical? A witty comedy of manners? Sure, I smiled a few times at the only funny character in the book, Mr. Bennett, but overall, I read, studied the sentence structure, noticed the wall paper and waited patiently as the paint dried. Even the dramatic ending where Lizzy gets the guy, is a letdown and dull. Just to let you know, I was joking about it being in any way dramatic. Which brings me to the characters. Other than Lizzy, they are all stereotypical and lack even the most remote concept of depth. Jane is pretty and sweet from the first page to the last. The mom is overbearing, the dad aloof. Other than Darcy, no one grows or changes in a book that spans a few years and endless pages.Normally, I use one star for books that I just can't finish and if I wasn't an aspiring author, I wouldn't have bothered to get through half the book, but since I did... and when I compare it to yawner like A Tale of Two Cities, I had to bump this one up a notch.PS, Don't read Moby Dick either, if you know what's good for you.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '”Pride has often been his best friend”Perfection in a book!!! One of the best stories and most wonderfully written books of all time. My favourite Jane Austen book because of this magnificent character sketch of pride and prejudice, it’s weighty themes and witty dialogue.Lively, spirited, humorous, and romantic. A carefully orchestrated story of love and deception, manners and impropriety, and of course pride and prejudice, all of which secures this book’s place in the Hall of Fame for classic literature and its continued popularity among many.Simply put a masterpiece. A comedy of manners and marriage!!!.The PlotWith the opening line""Any man in possession of a large fortune must be in want of a wife”, there is no doubt of Jane Austen’s intent. This is matchmakers’ paradise where wealth, class, marriage, courtship, social standing and the arrogance of the elite are pitched against those who wish to marry into fortune. Except not all young ladies believe wealth is more important than love.The storyline is simple. New arrival Charles Bingley, a rich bachelor from the North of England, rents the Netherfield estate close to the family home of Mr & Mrs Bennett. Keen to have her daughters married to wealthy husbands, Mrs Bennett asks her husband to pay a visit that secures an invitation to the Netherfield ball where the eldest daughter Jane, captures the attention of Charles Bingley.The same cannot be said of Eliza Bennett who elicits one of the most condemning remarks, in the book, from Bingley\'s friend, the aristocrat Mr Darcy, who does not see her as his equal. At this stage of the book Darcy is described as“haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting”. Of himself, he declares…“The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and everyday confirms my belief of the inconsistencies of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense.”Not exactly wrong of the time and characters but this sets the tone and backdrop for more heated exchanges and clashes between wealth and principle. As the exchanges between the two couples intensifies, their respective relationships are tested by the arrival of other possible suitors and a chain of events that sees the Bennett’s good name all but destroyed, until Mr Darcy intervenes. Not out of goodness but as he declares to Lizzy, he only thought of her.Coming out of nowhere, Darcy makes a marriage proposal to Elizabeth which almost seemed like a sport if it were not for the harsh exchange between the two main characters, and is so iconic I can’t remember how long ago I first encountered this memorable exchange.“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.""Alas, the story does not end there, and all comes good in the end.Review and CommentsThe themes of marriage, wealth, class, education, male inheritance, and social expectations are no surprise for books written in this period. However, what was so refreshing and captivating about this book is the balance of good versus evil, the steadfast principles held by some in contrast to the immoral behaviours of others. We are treated with a range of fabulous characters and the standout from the book – well it’s the humour!!! with scenes like Mr Collins\' absurd, awkward, and fumbling proposal to Elizabeth.However, one of my favourite book lines, was Mr Bennett’s riposte to his hypochondriac wife,“I have the highest respect for your nerves, they are my old friends.”A delightful, charming, easy to read classic with some explosive scenes and despicable characters that encapsulated so many themes. However, it is the two main characters that personfiied the predominant theme of the book - Pride and Prejudice.The unquestionable \'pride\' of Darcy who initially failed to appreciate Elizabeth for the intelligent and high-spirited person she was and for failing to contemplate a rejection or her feelings with his insensitive and misjudged marriage proposal. It is almost comical that Darcy goes to length to point out Eliza\'s inferiority during his offer of marriage, and reminds her that his love for her is ""against his will, against his reason, and even against his character"". Wow!!!Not without faults, it was Lizzy who then embodied \'prejudice\' for misjudging Darcy\'s and being blinded to his other virtues and goodness because of his class. Yet you can only adore Elizabeth for her freedom of thought, feminism and her ability to pervade her class and offer well voice’s opinions amidst so much snobbery and spite.The way in which the subplots, characters, themes and humour are so intricately woven into this wonderful story is what makes Pride and Prejudice one of my all time favourite books. A true masterpiece that had never aged, in my opinion.Other favourite quotes“Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.”“Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion.”“From the very beginning— from the first moment, I may almost say— of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.Ouch!!!If you haven’t watched the mini series or read the book I would encourage you to do both. It is no accident I chose to read ‘Pride and Prejudice’ as my first book of 2024 and to complete the experience I indulged in the BBC’s TV adaptation of the book for the 20+ time. Having watched different adaptations of the book, for me personally there is and can only be one Mr Darcy and it’s Colin Firth. In fact the whole cast is superb so I highly recommend this mini series over any others. I promise you will get an equally enjoyable but different experience with the book and this mini series.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""The Olympus of protagonist focused classic writingAusten owned her eraThe perfection of this novel is amazing and until today it´s difficult to impossible to name another book that has the same character development, hidden social critique, and amazing characters in a classical setting dealing with the grievances of an epoch. So less action and so much suspense just created by the inner perspective of the main protagonists that it´s a pleasure to read and reread. I just can´t get behind how Austen could write like a goddess and what makes each scene, word, setting, and plot twist so smooth and easy-going, while diving so deep under the skin of this bizarre, ancient society.Insider jokes to avoid the censors of the timeWhat I love about classics is the background, the society, norms and rules, and how the authors integrated, criticized, and commented on the big topics of their time and avoided censorship. Like Twain, London and a handful of other writers Austen has conserved the spirit of those days for eternity, making it a funny, intense, and unique novel.Evolution of feminist emancipationIt shows how complex women's roles evolved during history and how the immense stupidity of male-made humanities restricted much freedom and human rights and integrated hilarious, epic monuments of facepalmgasms instead. Just irony and satire in their highest form can be used as a mirror to reflect the impressions of a not so far away past, and to be able to laugh instead of sigh about it. If it just was history everywhere.So much better than most of the male writers of that timeAt a time when great writing could just be powered by talent, perseverance, intelligence, exercise, and passion (because there was no creative writing course just around the next corner or online), avoiding conservative worldviews and dogmas of the time, Austen wrote vivid, cliffhangery, and in perfect length with an inherent instinct for the rules of how to make true art. Not like many, mostly male, others, who praised their stupid beliefs in their racist, intolerant, and bad novels, or became pseudointellectual and impossible to understand for mentally healthy readers without narcissistic tendencies to push their ego (here, gratuitously hyped author, take that Nobel prize for that. Again), she wrote literature at it´s best.Unfounded criticism of her workI guess that many critics don´t have the time or interest to invest more effort than just reading it without a bit of researching history and the authors' biography to get the full pleasure of all the hidden easter eggs. Without that, it may really seem much more superficial and less well constructed than with the extra knowledge that enables one to enjoy it in full fan mode.It aged wellJust as a good wine (I don´t like wine, I´m a beer and vodka guy, it´s just about the allegory) classics need time, have to breathe, have to be consumed mindfully and consciously in certain doses, and a bit of decadent study about where the grapes were grown, what meal applies to it, etc. is never a bad idea. Otherwise, they would be indistinguishable from the mass-produced, blockbuster, media-hyped, disposable clone armies of today's literature. The same cheap booze that was already winepressed in each epoch to meet the expectations of ( then bigoted, now too uncritical) readers, that don´t care about the hangover more sophisticated consumers get from mental intoxication.That´s of course only true for non favorite genres I´m not (cognitively) biased, and thereby subjectively and emotionally bound, on.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of...Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Au...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_a...""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Pride and Prejudice is a novel by Jane Austen, first published in 1813. The story takes place in the fictional town of Meryton, England, in the late 18th century. The novel follows the life of Elizabeth Bennet, a witty and independent-minded young woman, as she navigates the social mores of her time and falls in love with Mr. Darcy, a wealthy and proud aristocrat.The novel begins with the arrival of Mr. Bingley, a wealthy gentleman, to Netherfield Park, a nearby estate. He is accompanied by his sisters and his best friend, Mr. Darcy. The Bennet family, consisting of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet and their five daughters, including Elizabeth, is excited by the prospect of meeting the new neighbors. However, when Mr. Darcy snubs Elizabeth at a ball, she immediately takes a dislike to him, and he to her, due to his pride and her prejudice against him.As the story progresses, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy encounter each other again and again, and their initial animosity gradually turns into attraction. However, their budding romance is threatened by a number of obstacles, including the interference of Mr. Darcy's haughty aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and the machinations of Mr. Wickham, a charming but untrustworthy gentleman who has a grudge against Mr. Darcy.Throughout the novel, Austen skillfully explores the themes of class, gender, and social hierarchy in Georgian England. She depicts a society in which a woman's value is determined by her ability to marry well and secure her family's future, and in which the upper classes maintain their status through strict adherence to social norms and codes of conduct. However, Austen also shows how individuals can challenge and subvert these norms, through their intelligence, wit, and courage.One of the novel's strengths is its vividly drawn characters, each of whom is unique and memorable. Elizabeth is a particularly appealing heroine, with her quick wit, strong opinions, and determination to live life on her own terms. Mr. Darcy, meanwhile, is a complex and intriguing hero, whose pride and sense of superiority are gradually revealed to be a cover for his vulnerability and insecurity.Another of Austen's strengths is her prose style, which is witty, precise, and elegant. Her use of irony and satire adds depth and nuance to the novel, allowing her to critique the social norms and expectations of her time while still entertaining her readers.The novel also offers a fascinating glimpse into the world of Georgian England, with its elaborate rituals of courtship, marriage, and social etiquette. Austen's keen observations of the manners and customs of the time, and her wry commentary on them, provide a richly detailed portrait of a bygone era. But at the same time, her characters are universally recognizable and relatable, making the novel as relevant today as it was when it was first published.Moreover, Pride and Prejudice has had a lasting impact on popular culture, inspiring countless adaptations, retellings, and spin-offs in various media. From film and television adaptations to stage productions, comic books, and even video games, the novel's enduring appeal has ensured its place as a cultural touchstone for generations to come.Overall, Pride and Prejudice is a timeless masterpiece of English literature, blending insightful social commentary with engaging characters, sparkling prose, and a deep understanding of the complexities of human relationships. It remains a beloved classic, treasured by readers and scholars alike, and its influence can be seen in countless works of literature and popular culture.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""‘It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife,’ begins Jane Austen’sPride and Prejudice, an opening sentence nearly as famous as the novel itself. Austen’s comedy of manners has taken on an immortality, being a title frequently represented in art, knick knacks or decor for book lovers. I mean, this is a book that has tshirts for it as recognizable as a Pink Floyd shirt and if there were a Mt. Rushmore for white people popular classics this would be one of the first to be carved into the rock. Luckily for readers everywhere, it is a book that truly deserves such status and is eminently readable and enjoyable to this day.Pride and Prejudiceis sharp, humorous and picturesquely romantic with a cast of characters that practically walk off the page, shake your hand and intermingle in your life as Austen dives into criticisms of class and conventions.‘I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.’Of the many reasonsPride and Prejudicehas captured hearts for generations, Austen’s heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, is the most endearing of them. A woman with a great wit and cutting dialogue, she is not without her flaws and hubris which makes her feel so authentic and approachable. The dynamic between Elizabeth and Darcy is a perfectly balanced power struggle of personal judgements as they attempt to maintain individuality under social pressures and obdurate conventions, each stradling a position of both protagonist and antagonist. And antagonize each other they do! Though in the end they come to each other with equal scars and blame. Elizabeth’s belief in her ability to judge others leads her to misjudge—a trait not unlike Emma Woodhouse ofEmmawho’s pride in her own wit obscured what was right before her—overlooking the blatant flaws of Wickham simply over his adversarial role towards Darcy, and coming too harshly to conclusions on Darcy before knowing him better. It should be with no surprise to learn that Austen originally intended to title the novel ‘First Impressions’.‘From the very beginning— from the first moment, I may almost say— of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.’We see Elizabeth working on herself internally while also working on the external social factors. ‘There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others,’ Elizabeth confesses, ‘my courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me.’ Her pride makes her malign others, assuming Miss darcy, for instance, to be a ‘proud, reserved, disagreeable girl’ only to find she is ‘amiable and unpretending.’ It is her intelligence I find most charming, and while she may misjudge, she has the emotional intelligence to self-diagnose and course correct.Darcy, on the other hand, must overcome his own pride and snobbery. His disdain for those who work a trade, for instance, is part of a larger depiction of those held in high esteem of class being crude and cruel and a predominant theme in the novel. Caroline, Mr. Collins and Lady Catherine are among those who operate like an extension of class hierarchy, allowing their ideas of social position to guide their thoughts and actions and making them feel immune to criticism. Darcy and Elizabeth lowering their guard, looking at the individual instead of at their social circle/status, and coming to a mutual understanding gives the novel a tender nature, one that asks for empathy and understanding in the world and warns against holding on to judgements too tightly.‘Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.’Another aspect of the novel that really resonates is just how visual it is. Austen has a gift for description and this quality has lent itself to many visually stunning film adaptations. Austen excels at embedding much of her social commentary into her depictions of settings and characters, such as Elizabeth’s first visit to Darcy’s house, with ‘high woody hills’ and a large, tall garden surrounding a the house, ‘a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.’ This is a major insight into Darcy as a character: a man without artifice and full of ‘natural beauty’ that he keeps hidden from view. His arrogance is merely his grandiose garden that obscures the him beneath the exterior. Similarly, judgements on character are often made in dialogue that focuses on aspects of dress or decor. ‘By describing a material object,’Roland Bartheswrites inThe Language of Fashion, ‘if it is not to construct it or to use it, we are led to link the qualities of its matter to a second meaning.’ The criticisms of taste are, in this regard, a criticism of character, so when Caroline and Louisa talk at length about the mud on Elizabeth’s petticoat, we can infer they are telling us they find her herself to be wild, unkempt and unruly. It is in ways such as these that Austen can make such keen observations that don't announce themselves yet amalgamate to portray a life-like impression of a society that thrives on gossip and social interactions that are plotted like chess pieces moving across the board.‘I must learn to be content with being happier than I deserve.’Austen’sPride and Prejudicedrifts at the pace of life, enrapturing you in its lush language, vibrant landscapes, dancing with you through the great halls of ornate homes and giving you an introduction to the high society of the times. This is an eternally charming novel that bites with sharp satire and humor while letting deep lessons and emotional bubble up from tender moments and brilliant insights. It is quite funny at times as well. Jane Austen is remembered for a reason, and while I still favorEmmato be my favorite, this comedy of manners is certainly a Must Read.4.5/5‘What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.’""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'it is official: now everyone on the planet has read this book. i was the last holdout, and being the last person (excluding those who are just being born...... now) i am sorry i didn\'t like it more. i knew going into it that i was not a jane austen girl; i had read two others and thought them bloodless and mercantile. but everyone said to me, ""well, you haven\'t read pride and prejudice is why you don\'t like her."" which i thought might be valid. but it\'s not. because i still don\'t care. this is not the greatest love story of all time. it\'s more like the most amiable alliance of compatible feelings that ends up in a mutually agreeable union and merging of fortunes and temperaments. i mean, really. this book needs heathcliff to come barreling in on a stallion all wet from the moors to ravish all five of these daughters and show them what a real man is all about. now there\'s a love story...come to my blog!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Society, with all its restrictive constructs, is one nasty piece of work.It comes with so many silly rules, so many silly expectations. Those of social station and wealth must be seen to marry someone of the same “worth” regardless of the feelings involved; they must be seen to marry someone on their level of class structure. But what of love? What of passion? Should it be quenched because of these all-encompassing silly constructs?Austen doesn’t think so.Enter Darcy, a man who is royally pissed off; he has fallen in love with someone considered far beneath him, to declare his love for her is to step outside the realms of his supposed pedigree: it is a form of social death. So he is a man torn in two. At the route of things, he is a product of his society; consequently, he is affected by its values. Although he hates it all the same; thus, the long sullen silences, the seemingly moody and arrogant exchanges with Elizabeth. But it’s all the expression of a man struggling to deal with the raging tempest of emotions that have taken hold of his mind: his being.“In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.”Indeed, Austen slowly reveals the dangers of false perception as she gradually peels away the mask of this stoic pillar of aristocracy, and underneath blossoms a misunderstood and sensitive soul. So the romance plot is born. Elizabeth eventually loses her prejudice and sees through Darcy’s false pride. Darcy loses his integrated construct of prejudice and ignores the pride of his relatives. As ever with Austen, the title of the work is suggestive of the main motifs; she’s never subtle as its all ways clear which way her razor sharp sarcasm is pointed.So love conquers all. Austen was a strong advocate of social mobility, and often it’s based upon love in her works. But she only believes in real love. She’s not interested in fleeting moments of heat and sexual lust; she portrays true and lasting romantic attachments, relationships that are strong and real. For her, such things transcend class boundaries, wealth and intelligence. Love is love. It doesn’t matter who it is with as long as it is real; hence, Austen becomes a critique of society and its customs that prevent these relationships from being realised. She knows how stupid it is, and she loves to poke fun of her caricatures of the old stilted class of her era: the ones that resist her ideas.Is this the best Austen?I did really enjoy this book, and I have given it five stars, but it’s not as good as her other works. For me it lacks the moral growth ofNorthanger AbbeyandEmma.It lacks the conciseness ofPersuasion.The emphasis on the injustice of romance has made it popular, though I do strongly believe that the love inPersuasionis stronger than it is here. That endures rejection, separation, war and decades; yet, it still lingers. I love Austen, and I have loved each one of her books I’ve read so far in different ways. I hope to continue to do so. This is the fourth Austen I’ve given five stars, I can easily celebrate her as one of my favourite writers.__________________________________You can connect with me on social media viaMy Linktree.__________________________________'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '(Book 938 from 1001 Books) - Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenPride and Prejudice is a romantic novel by Jane Austen, first published in 1813.The story charts the emotional development of the protagonist, Elizabeth Bennet, who learns the error of making hasty judgments and comes to appreciate the difference between the superficial and the essential.عنوان: غرور و تعصب - جین اوستین (نشر نی، بنگاه ترجمه و نشر، زرین) ادبیات انگلستان؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: سال 1974میلادیعنوان:غرور و تعصب؛اثر:جین اوستین (آستین)؛مترجم:شمس الملوک وزیری؛مشخصات نشر:تهران، بنگاه ترجمه و نشر کتاب، 1336، در 661ص، زیر نظر احسان یارشاطر؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان بریتانیا - سده 19ممترجم: شاهرخ پورانفر، تهران، زرین، 1362، در 536صمترجم: رضا رضایی، تهران، نشر نی، 1385، در 449صترجمه های دیگر خانمها و آقایان: «شایسته ابراهیمی»؛ «فرزانه حاجیلوئیان»؛ «صنعان صدیقی»؛ «راضیه میرزایی»؛ «عبدالحسین صبوری»؛ «اعظم ضامن\u200cپور»؛ «مرتضی صادقی\u200cزاده»؛ «مجید غلامی شاهدی»؛ «فائزه ارباب»؛ «فرناز سلطانی»؛ «سهیلا امامی»؛ «سعیده هاشمی»؛ «میروحید ذنوبی»؛ «الهام رحمانی»؛ «نوید اصلانی»؛ «مجید معتمدی راد»؛ «بهاره هاشمیان»؛ «میترا میرشکار»؛ «فرشید غضنفری و حسن طاهری»؛ «مریم امیری»؛ «فاطمه نصرتی»؛ «كیوان عبیدی\u200cآشتیانی»؛ «فرناز اخوان\u200cطباطبایی»؛ «رحیم اصلانی»؛ «کرم شکرزاده»؛ «رستو عوض\u200cزاده»؛ «سبا هاشمی\u200cنسب»؛ «مهشید مجتهدزاده»؛ «سحر پوریایی»؛ «هانیه چوپانی»؛ و ...؛داستان را «جین آستین» در سن بیست و یک سالگی، و در سال 1796میلادی بنوشته است، و برای نخستین بار در سال 1813میلادی چاپ شده؛ و در ایران به سال 1336هجری خورشیدی، با ترجمه ی بانو «شمس الملوک وزیری»، به زیور طبع آراسته گشته است؛ آقا و خانم «بنت» پنج دختر دارند «جین»، «الیزابت»، «لیدیا»، «مری»، و «کیتیا».؛ «جین» و «الیزابت»، بزرگتر و زیباتر از سه خواهر دیگر خویش هستند؛ مردی سرشناس و ثروتمند، به نام «چارلز بینگلی»، در باغ خویش، و در همسایگی آنها زندگی میکند؛ او بسیار مهربان و خوش چهره است؛ خانم «بنت» کوشش میکند، مرد جوان یکی از دخترانش را، به همسری خویش برگزیند؛ و ... ادامه داستان؛نقل از برگردان جناب رضا رضایی: («الیزابت» که دلیلی نمی\u200cدید این حالت بلاتکلیفی را ادامه بدهد، به محض رفتن «کیتی»، با جسارت تمام باز هم با آقای «دارسی» راه رفت؛ حالا وقتش شده بود که تصمیمش را عملی کند؛ به خودش جرئت داد و گفت: آقای «دارسی»، من آدم کاملا خودخواهی هستم؛ برای آرامش دادن به احساسات خودم هیچ فکر نمی\u200cکنم که شاید احساسات شما جریحه دار بشود؛ نمی\u200cتوانم جلو خودم را بگیرم و بابت محبت فوق العاده\u200d ای که در حق خواهر بیچاره\u200c ام کرده\u200c اید از شما تشکر نکنماز وقتیکه به این مطلب پی برده\u200c ام، مدام دلم می\u200cخواسته به شما بگویم که چه احساس امتنانی دارم؛ اگر بقیۀ افراد خانواده نیز می\u200cدانستند، الان صرفاً من نبودم که تشکر خود را به زبان می\u200cآوردم؛ «دارسی» هیجان\u200cزده و متعجب جواب داد: متأسفم، خیلی متأسفم که شما از موضوعی باخبر شده\u200c اید که اگر درست به شما انتقال نداده باشند، احتمالا باعث رنجش می\u200cشود؛ هیچ فکر نمی\u200cکردم که خانم «گاردینر» اینقدر غیرقابل اعتماد باشند؛ - زن دایی\u200c ام تقصیری ندارد؛ حواس پرتی «لیدیا» باعث شد من بفهمم شما در قضیه دخیل بوده\u200c اید؛ خب، من هم تا جزئیات برایم روشن نمی\u200cشد، آرامش پیدا نمی\u200cکردم؛ اجازه بدهید بارها از شما تشکر کنم؛ از طرف همۀ اعضای خانواده\u200c ام تشکر می\u200cکنم، به خاطر بلندنظری و محبتی که محرک شما در اینکار پر زحمت بوده و این همه دردسر را تحمل کرده بودید، تا آنها را پیدا کنید)؛ پایان نقلتاریخ بهنگام رس��نی 25/05/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 05/05/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Always an utter delight.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""i bought it and now i guess it's time to reread it, lolmy spotify playlist“You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.”i want a mr. darcy, but this world is full with wickhams and collins, ugh.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I don't think I will ever be able to properly explain my obsession with this book.Everytime I read Pride and Prejudice (though it’s been many years since I’ve done a reread) I find something else to love about it.Jane Austen renders a beautiful display of English country life in the early 1800s and the complexity of ordinary people — all their vanities, their flaws and their quirks.The writing is lush and descriptive with a slow melting pace filled with subtle humour, sarcasm and witty banter.“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever.”The author created a fantastic and varied cast of characters. The absurdities of the secondary characters are what kept the plot light and fun.Elizabeth’s whole family (excluding Jane) were a trainwreck of silly individuals.But none are like Mr Collins. This man never fails to astound me with his silliness. The things he said were half ridiculously funny and the other half of the time I just wanted to smack him.Characters like Miss Bingley, Mr Wickham and Lady Catherine were also infuriating at times.Something I always find extremely entertaining in these types of classics is theunderhanded savagery delivered through a facade of polite smiles and impeccable manners. It’s admirable, really 😂 .But let’s talk about our otp.We have Elizabeth Bennet who does not care about societal expectations.She will not marry for anything less than love and mutual respect. And would rather marry no one than marry someone she couldn’t love. For the time that this book was published, this was revolutionary as women had little power and choice.Lizzy is strong minded and makes hasty judgments but I adore her loyalty and admire her fierce protectiveness of those she cares about. She soon learns to not judge too quickly after a few too many misunderstandings.“There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me.”And then we have Darcy who is oursocially awkward wreckwho doesn’t know how to talk to people andhides his uncomfortability behind a mask of arrogance. What I loved most about his arc is thathe listens, reflects on his behavior and strives to be better. He grows into someone worthy of Lizzy’s respect without the expectation of her returning his feelings.Can y’all hear me swooning over here?“Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?”“For the liveliness of your mind, I did.”The romance isn’t a wild passion, but a slow build between two people who are wrong in their first impressions of one another, then grow to admire the other.It’s soft, it’s gentle and it’s e v e r y t h i n g.If you’re looking to get into reading Austen, or even classics in general, I really think Pride and Prejudice is the place to start.

A ​Court of Silver Flames (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #4)
",Sarah J. Maas,4.47,1530793,1219,"Fantasy, Romance, Romantasy, Fiction, Fantasy Romance, Audiobook, Fae",757,16-02-2021,"Nesta Archeron has always been prickly-proud, swift to anger, and slow to forgive. And ever since being forced into the Cauldron and becoming High Fae against her will, she's struggled to find a place for herself within the strange, deadly world she inhabits. Worse, she can't seem to move past the horrors of the war with Hybern and all she lost in it.The one person who ignites her temper more than any other is Cassian, the battle-scarred warrior whose position in Rhysand and Feyre's Night Court keeps him constantly in Nesta's orbit. But her temper isn't the only thing Cassian ignites. The fire between them is undeniable, and only burns hotter as they are forced into close quarters with each other.Meanwhile, the treacherous human queens who returned to the Continent during the last war have forged a dangerous new alliance, threatening the fragile peace that has settled over the realms. And the key to halting them might very well rely on Cassian and Nesta facing their haunting pasts.Against the sweeping backdrop of a world seared by war and plagued with uncertainty, Nesta and Cassian battle monsters from within and without as they search for acceptance-and healing-in each other's arms.","[{'rating': 1, 'content': '✨hardcore Nesta and Cassian fans need not engage. shoo !!✨She drew up short. “I’m not afraid of anything.”but you will be afraid of me when I rant about you. bitch.Now on to the point which is this book. Oh, this book. Oh, this damn, freaking pathetic book. This has been: One of the worst experiences of my life. I\'m freaking salty and I need a refund of my expectations.Let me make something clear. This book actually made me realize that iusedto like the original trilogy a lot. But - SJMruined every. single. thing.She ruined everything good about those precious, loveable books and characters. So, now I just hate everyone 😊Now, what are the actual good things in this book you may askanything that is not Cassian, Nesta, Mor, Amren, Feyre, Rhysand• LUCIEN• AZRIEL•He said Feyre Darling and she told him no goodbyes Rhys• the endThis book was entriely useless. Things this book has include:• cringey talk• Nesta and Cassian (what\'s their ship name?) scaring me to death.• bad, horribly redundant writing• Nesta\'s inner fire blah blah• Nesta eating my brain•Cassian\'s cock rubbing against the seam of his pantsevery two pages (literally i\'m not even joking)• bad sex• Nesta screaming about how she sucks• mate• Nesta thinking she owns the world• everyone looking at Nesta and falling to their knees (hulk smash)• everyone looking at Nesta and sayingmother save you(i will gouge my eyes out if i have to read ""mother save you"" ever again)• Nesta getting a new superpower every 50 pages. i mean it.• NESTA AND CASSIAN BEING OH SO PRETTY• a lot of boring girl talk• Cassian and Nesta doing it everywhere• boring Nesta things which i skipped• Nesta being a bitch the entire book and doing inexcusable shit and then apologizing in the last 50 pages or sth and suddenly everyone forgives herrr• some boring side characters• an absolutely boring plotline (non-existent is a better word)• and as soon as things between Nesta and Cassian are resolved, the plot was dissolved into thin airBasically, this book sucked. badly. I wanted to crawl into a freaking hole and die. My eyes are literally bleeding from the amount of stupidity in this book.AND THE SIMILARITIES I CAN DRAW BETWEEN THIS BOOK AND ACOMAF(but let\'s be real ACOMAF is superior with a really good plotline, an actual love letter for people to heal, good chemistry, excellent characters and with an amazing ending).Firstly - Nesta and Cassian:Nestaaaaaaaaaaaa. THE BITCH. She did nothing, nothing while Feyre provided for them AND STILL, SHE BLAMES EVERY SINGLE PERSON. Like she was mad that Feyre found a new family but basically Nesta did everything in her power to push Feyre out of the picture when they were human. I do get it that some people protect themselves by using angry words or whatever BUT to me she just seemed like aselfish bitch. And when everyone finally grew sick of her bullshit she\'s like: oh my god everyone hates me.Yes, I do. I do hate you.(Update:Someone told me i was being disrespectful towards people who suffer from PTSD. Well, it certainly wasn\'t what I was saying but if, in anyway, my words have hurt you then I\'m extremely sorry.BUT Nesta\'s PTSD doesn\'t justify her behavior. Let me take an example from this book. Isn\'t tam-tam suffering from PTSD? But the way she treated him? Was that perfectly fine? The point is that this isn\'t only about her PTSD. She wasn\'t suffering from such a thing before going into the Cauldron. If you read ACOTAR from the beginning, you\'ll see what kind of character Nesta was from page 1. If she treated other people suffering from depression like Feyre, Tamlin, oh the way she talks to Lucien then how can anyone even expect that I give her space - when she doesn\'t give that to others?)and just to show her ✨superior powers✨we are constantly told that:• Amren shivered (ohhh scary)• her power ... is death herself (dramatic much?)• Rhysand\'s face grew white (*eye roll*)• Mother save you all (okay but pls shut up with that line)At this point, I am fucking begging SJM on my knees to stop making every single person in her world the epitome of power.and her POV was so boring. IS THIS CHARACTER GROWTH? :’) I could watch the grass grow instead of this. It was so bland after she had mentioned about 1000 times in only the first 200 pages thatshe is angry. Okay we get it. Now stop. But sadly Nesta didn\'t stop. All she could think about was: Cassian\'s cock, how unworthy she is (for his cock),the fire within her wanting to burstttttt or sth. ffs. I have never read a book more redundant than this.We were at the 600+ page mark and still Nesta didn’t change ONE BIT. All her character growth came out of the blue in the last 50 pages which just felt like the dumbest, most miserable attempt at making her seem better (it failed btw).the girl said to Elain:“Spare me the bullshit, please.”I read in a review that Elain didn\'t try to help Nesta. SHE DID. She was there for her. but Ms. Prissy Princess was too into herself to see that. And then she kept raving about Elain choosing Feyre yeah yeah shut up.and she literally said Cassian tastes like crackling embers?? C R A C K L I N G E M B E R S. and then fire roared in her blood and there was an extremely cringey makeout scene after that. Oh, the sex scenes were so cringey, i skipped them whole 😌✊and then there’s Cassian. I used to LIKE Cassian, I LIKED his jokes and attitude.But SJM being SJM turned him from an interesting character into a sex addict. He makes such stupid jokes the entirety of the book, and there is a single thought in his head: his cock. 👏👏👏 he has zero sense, idk why people even like him in this book. I was so sick of reading every two minutes that he wants to fuck Nesta OKAY WE GET IT NOW MOVE ON THINK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. MY GOOD SIR YOU ARE A GENERAL OF AN ARMY OF THE BIGGEST COURT IN PRYTHIAN. DO YOU SERIOUSLY NOT HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO DO?Secondly – the plot that never was:Their world used to be so interesting to me and I don’t gaf what anyone else says, the entire concept of courts and worlds and gahh I loved it and I wanted to know more about it.But instead of discovering more about this world, we spend 700 pages reading Nessian fucking each other in every position instead of discovering more about this world. I WISH the plot was given the attention it needed but sadly – it wasn’t. Basically, everything that happened in the (non-existent) plot was to give Nesta more superpowers *rolls eyes*This is in no way a fantasy, even labeling it as such is an atrocity. NOTHING HAPPENS IN TERMS OF PLOT.Thirdly - Rhysand:And then there\'s the elephant in the room.Rhysand. I cannot for the life of me believe this is the same person from the previous books. If a man treated me the way Rhysand treated the women around him in this book, i would eat him alive. And this is a major statement coming from me since I loved Rhysand to the point of pasting his face all over my house and I spent all my teenage years worshipping on his shrine.SJM gave his character a 180 degree turn from the man we all met and fell in love with in ACOMAF. Is this the same man who helped Feyre heal in ACOMAF? YOU\'RE ACTUALLY TELLING ME THAT RHYSAND WOULD DO THIS TO FEYRE? Do y\'all remember chapter 54 of ACOMAF? Do y\'all remember all the things he did for her? How in seven hells is this the same person?I will never in a million lifetimes forgive SJM for destroying one of my favourite characters. A character i genuinely loved, a character i cried over, a character itrusted- now forever destroyed. RIP Rhysand.And this isn\'t just the problem with Rhysand. SJM made the entire Inner Circle go from people who suffered and were full of empathy for others to these immature childish bastards whose sole purpose is to somehow berate Nesta.Conclusion:Lucien and Azriel are the only good things left in this book, they are my precious babies whom i will protect till the day i die AND IF SOMEONE SAYS ONE BAD THING ABOUT LUCIEN AGAIN, YOU BETTER BELIEVE I WILL RIP THE FABRICS OF THE WORLD TO EAT THAT PERSON ALIVE.I\'ve said it before, i\'ll say it again. Mass is not a bad writer. I love her ToG series (her superior series btw). She\'s good when she wants to be and I just wish she bothered writing ACOSF and writing Nesta’s character and her journey in a more believable way.You can\'t argue with the fact that Nesta is a pretty toxic character whose redeeming qualities came at about page 600+ after doing inexcusable shit the entirety of the book and for me that\'s too late. And then there\'s the matter of everyone around her being so fuckingdisgusting, i don\'t even know who I dislike more.What this world needs is for these 500-year-old hooligans (who haven’t learnt a single thing in their entire millennia of living) to step aside and let ME rule the Night Court (I’d be a better leader than any of them anyway) with Azriel by my side.Let\'s just hope the next book is A HUGE BOOK ABOUT AZRIEL because no one deserves it more than him 😭 Pls SJM give him the book he deserves.------------that cover is 2020 in the flesh'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Spoilers hidden because I’m not a dickThis review gonna be a lili bit of raving about this book by itself VS ranting how it was as a continuation of Maas’s seriesHonestly, my biggest challenge going into this book was all my preconceptions of this world and its characters.The stakes were high.Cassianis one of the biggest favorites in the fandomWhereas Nesta has a reputation for being a....So going into it, the book was better when I tried to block out all the nasty shit in previous books and high expectations.This isn’t the start of a new ✨Maas✨series, just a standalone romance happening in same world.I highly recommend that mindset cuz then it's less disappointing. Moving on,꧁The Characters꧂I have never likedNesta Acheron. sorry not sorry. I didn’t like her much in the previous books but I acknowledge that her character has potential for such depth that Maas really tried to develop here.But did it work?Typically these characters dynamics would usually have me ✨screaming✨with a bloodthirsty heroine and spitfire cocky guy who always comes back for her!!I’ve always loved Cassian. But i didnt*quite*love his POV.I felt like thru an attempt of making his character more dimensional, we lost some of his key characteristics as the flirtatous badasswho uses humor and adrenaline to cope... Yes it was amazing getting insight into his thoughts and Maas’s writing style easily adopted this dual perspective. I just wish we got more of the Cassian that trained Freye and let her punch out as needed while cracking jokes at Rhysands expensive.Maas is known for her growling, purring, overprotective, asshole, alpha males. BUT I LOVEEE ITTTTAnd his relationship with Nesta was so well developed. He knows Nesta as a victim, killer, broken girl, self-sufficient woman, and general badass.He's seen it alll and he keeps coming back for her.Together, these two were the perfect combination fora hot chaotic relationshipthat had you swooning, cackling, and gasping.I don't think Nesta will ever be my fav characterhowever her story really speaks to mental health for someone who reacts/protects themselves with sharp words and angerSome describe Nesta as ambitious and authoritative character but to me she was veryselfish, cold, and distant. She did nothing to help Feyre provide for their family and spent the money Freye earned on frivolous items. THEN in fey world went on whole refusing to train/ help others but demanding they protect ONE of her sisters?!*fuck off*In this book, She*finally*had moments of -well i’m tired of not being able to protect myself. LIKE YES BITCH THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL BEEN SAYING THIS WHOLE TIMESo on that element, I was sooo glad she was actually making progress and decisions!At the same time, I found myself disappointed with the Inner Circle*gasp*I know, I was sad about it too. I understood why they were done with her shit. Because, same.But the constant bashing of Nesta's drinking, sex, and weight were low blows especially compared to the violence and weight loss Freyre went thru. hypocrites much? I fully recognize this isn’t reflective of the characters we knowbut its Nesta’s perspective of the charactersacting towards her...*Shrug*꧁The Maas Quality꧂Honestly, sad to report no major twists. It was just a really good, borderline dark, romance driven by character development and lottttasexy sexy fun timessince its not longer YAIf I had just randomly picked this up, then this book would’ve been off the charts with such dynamic characters, beautiful worldbuilding, and an okay plot.But in comparison with her others, this book seemed kinda basic and was missing some intricate detail plot twists that you usually can count on with Maas.To sum up it was an epic story of redemption-- Of a girl finding herself again after tragedy. And along the way she makes friends, and a lover who listens to her who supports her rough recovery, and not always her actions.Somehow this book felt soooo long and overly descriptive.. but also was not enough. No idea how that happens but there it is.The next threat/enemy makes logical sense. So I liked thatI wanted Nesta to get fierce FOR her sisters and be finally willing to fight FOR them. I lovesome badass sisters dynamicsof teasing each other, bitching at each other but would do anything for each other in the end!Didn't really quite get that.I was constantly underwhelmed by Nesta. She talks lotta shit but what has she actually done?She has continuously refused to show initiative in her own life and failed to provide for herself. Instead, she constantly chose to lean on the resources of others for her survival.All she has done is complain.Complainabout her human life while refusing to work and save herself or her sisters.Complainabout the happiness her lili sister found while refusing to be part of it.Complainabout the only people willing to fight and save humans while refusing to train or learn to fight FOR HERSELF.iM bOrEd and AnGeReD by the dismissive bullshit that defined her character up to this point in the seriesThis book showed some sparks of greatness! Taking initiative in her life! Using all that spitfire and backbone to make something for herself! But in the end, it kinda failed to live up to the fierce powerful Nesta I was hoping she would transform into.Reading this book you can’t help but compare to Maas’ other great heroines.I think the big difference is that Aelin always kept moving forward. And Bryce was a little shit. But Nesta handled her depression by freezing and becomingnasty.Which is just really hard to read sometimes.Overall, I’m glad I read this book but it won’t be a major re-read like most Maas books. The book stands on the friendship the characters build, Nesta overcoming her despair and FINALLY developing her interesting powers. I greatly enjoyed the character dynamics of how Cassian and Nesta are such strong complex characters, but I wanted their romance to be more epic and to sweep me away. I love this world and all the creatures and BADASS FEMALE WARRIORS but the plot was lacking and I hate the power change that a lot of Maas’ characters are undergoing.If you are teetering whether to read this book, I gotta tell you to lower your expectations and try to forget the bullshit of Nesta’s past in order to just fully enjoy this book. It was pretty great seeing the Inner Circle’s relationships in the aftermath of Wings and Ruin, especially through Nesta’s harsh eye that hardcore READS THESE BITCHES and all their flaws. Plus it gives some foreshadowing and builds excitement for which characters might be next.It was a good romance, but it wasn’t a great Maas book.ALSO I’M STIL FRIGGEN PISSED ABOUT THAT COVER-------------------------------------------------------------------------Pre-Book thoughtsI have never likedNesta.sorry not sorry. I didn’t like her much in the previous books but I acknowledge that her character does have potential for such depthSome describe Nesta as ambitious and authoritative character but to me she was veryselfish, cold, and distant. She did nothing to help Feyre provide for their family and spent the money Freye earned on frivolous items. THEN in fey world goes on whole refusing to train/ help others but demanding they protect ONE of her sisters?!*fuck off*Just the idea of a sister knowingly fucking over another in how she treated Freyre as human for YEARS ... it actually hurts my heart a little bit .... that kinda selfishnessBut Cassian liking her will probably MAKE me like her more*god i hope so cuz he deserves the best*I just sick of Nesta's unrelenting nastiness while also hoping she resolves her trauma and that Cassian finds the happiness he deservesWish listIt’d be kinda cool to find out that she was doing something—sacrificing—to help the familythat Freyre never knewback when they were humans behind the wallShe just needsSOME redeeming qualityfor all the times she constantly bitching and lashing out at everyone. Some reason for why the whole Cassian ignoring thing and treating her sis Feyre like dirt*shaking my fucking head*Also generally she way 2 protective and angry towards people for there not to be some sorta backstory or event behind it hahahCover:ehhh I not really a fan of this style... also don’t think it really suited for Cassian with the hardcore Autumn court theme and colors. This just seems like such a let-down and step-down compared to the artful creativity and beauty of Crescent City*frowny face*But its Maas so of courseeeee imma read it*duhhhh*""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""EDIT: this kind of blew up so I just wanted to say that if you're one of those people writing essays in the comment section to try to change my mind: I don't care lol 😭 good for you for being passionate about something but I'm not here to read a think piece on why you disagree, stream red velvet tho xThe following will contain major spoilers.Nobody is surprised. I knew absolutely nothing would make this book good, save SJM deciding not to write it altogether.Now, I have to make it clear upfront: IloveNesta. I really resonate with the way that she deals with her own emotions and is consequently treated by the people around her. That being said, I loathe SJM’s books. I only begrudgingly pushed through this for Nesta, and even that wasn’t worth it.Nothingcould have made this worth it.I’m not here to give a criticism of the plot or politics, because I’m sure nobody cares (I don’t). I’m also not here to judge the sex aspect of this book, although I know many people have chosen to critique that. Instead, I’d like to cover the three cardinal sins this book committed:respect, rebirth, and rhysand.RespectACOSF starts off with our heroine using drinking and sex as her coping mechanism. The third book in the ACOTAR trilogy left our main characters, especially Nesta, heavily traumatized. She witnessed her good-for-nothing father come back after he didnothingfor her or her sisters as children and try to fight Hybern. She watches as he dies in front of her. She watches as thousands of Illyrian soldiers die. She watches as Cassian is nearly killed multiple times in front of her. She’s underweight, depressed, has PTSD, and gets shit all because of it.No, in fact, she’spunishedfor it.The straw that broke the camels back is the fact that she spent 500 gold on beer and gambling. Now, the problem isn’t that she drank or gambled. It’s that she used this money-which is HILARIOUS considering that Rhysand owns five houses and pays each Inner circle member a salary that is so grotesquely huge it’s described in previous books as being more than they’ll ever need in their lifetimes. Rhysand is even completely fine with the fact that Velaris is full of so-called “slums” but oh, no, NESTA can’t be living in one! It’s fine if poor people exist, she’s just not allowed to be one of them because it’s “embarrassing” to them. Obviously, they cut her off completely, DESTROYED the entire neighborhood she lived in (has anyone wondered what the fuck happened to the other people living there lmao? are they just homeless now?), and ship her off to a sexist, homophobic war camp with the one person she doesn’t want to be around because being depressed is just /such/ a sin.She is repeatedly berated by every member in the court. Some lovely examples:>Cassian tells her that everyone “fucking hates (her)” and later makes this out to be “oh, I just said that but I didn’t really mean it.”>During one of their sex scenes she asks him if his friends won’t be angry with him for sleeping with her because she’s so aware of the fact that they hate her.>“Perhaps you can find it in yourself to try a little harder this year.”>He jokes that she might order him to kill himself, and she asks him if he really thinks she’s capable of that. Because this entire time they’ve made her feel like sheisa monster.>Mor tells her that she “never deserved the benefit of the doubt that good people like (Cassian) give her” and also says that she should be thrown into the court of nightmares. For anyone unaware, the court of nightmares is where her homophobic and abusive family is.>Amren constantly makes fun of her appearance and berates her for having sex. She tells her she looks awful at every opportunity, and always chalks it up to be because she sleeps around and drinks too much.>Rhysand gets his own section for abhorrent comments.There is no end to it. Every chapter brought a character insulting her for justexisting.Her weight problems are described fucking atrociously. The first time Cassian even sees her in the book he comments on how she’s “skin and bones” but guys, he still wants to tap that. Every time her weight is mentioned is either to insult her for starving herself because, need I remind you, she’s DEPRESSED, or it’s for Cassian to point out while he talks about how hot she is.All of this. All 768 pages of insult after insult after humiliation and pointless paragraphs forNestato apologize tothem.Because it’s /her/ fault she’s depressed. It’s /her/ fault she has PTSD. It’s /her/ fault and she needs to change for everyone else. Because everyone forced her to leave against her will because theylovedher, something they make sure to remind her of every single damn chapter. Nesta is disrespected by everyone throughout the entire book and is rewarded for it by being the one who must respect them instead.RebirthYou have no idea how excited I was back when I was an ACOTAR fan and Nesta was rebirthed as a High Fae and got her powers from the cauldron. It was like watching someone so similar to me-someone who was mean, and opinionated, andboldhold all the power in the world. I wanted to see how SJM would write her journey of becoming physically and mentally strong-of mastering her powers.We see glimpses of it. How her eyes shine with fire. How she sears the stairs she walks on with a single finger. The light emanating from her. The way she is single-handedly more powerful than Rhysand, who was said to be the strongest High Lord. It was incredible.And then she gave it all up.That’s it. Journey’s over. She gave up all of the power she had, but not before using it to mutate her pelvis so that she would be able to birth an Illyrian baby without dying.Yeah. That’s all.RhysandI have never met a character whom I loathe more than Rhysand. Perfect, feminist king Rhysand who loves giving women a choice so long as they pick the one he wants them to. He’s the most worthless, pathetic, egomaniac asshole I’ve ever read about. His name is mentioned 791 times, which is 791 times too many.It’s made very clear from the get-go that he hates Nesta. He’s aggressive toward her in a way that makes me want to strangle him every time he speaks. Every comment toward her or about her is an ill-intended remark.Nesta makes what he knows of him clear early on: “Any offering Rhysand threw her way was solely out of love for Feyre.”Wait for it, things are about to get comedic.When Nesta finds out about Feyre’s pregnancy, Rhysand looks at her threateningly, because of course he thinks she’s a danger to his kid. It says, “Rhysand was not only male, but a Fae male, and he would eliminate any threats to his mate and child.”Here comes the funny part—Absolutely hilarious to me that Rhysand wants to be the white vanilla king who loves women (and is definitely not misogynistic) and his wife SO MUCH that he hid from her the fact that her giving birth could potentially kill her.Oh yeah!Because wanting to protect your mate (gag) involves lying to her about her own body and child. He strictly forbids anyone tells her about it, so, naturally, Nesta tells her.Now, I’m not going to sit here and pretend like she had good intentions. She was just doing it to be an ass. But at least she told the god damn woman that the kid inside of her was going to KILL HER! And then, Feminist king Rhysand declared, and-I-quote, “Get Nesta out of this city. Right now. Before I fucking kill her.”Round of applause for our cracker saltine lord ruler Rhyse Hall, everybody.I have no other words. No words for how every single time Nesta dared to stand up to the awful way she was treated by him Cassian would get angry ather.As if Rhys was some infallible God who could do no wrong and must never be criticized. No matter how large his wrongdoing was, it was always her fault. Always her who was the problem.I just feel like...I don't know. I like Cassian, or I did, at least. I think that a good love interest should both support the heroine and call her out when she's being a dick, but relentlessly siding against her is just so ??? What's even the point? His entire family hates her guts, and he doesn't do much to make her think otherwise or to comfort her about it. He definitely doesn't act like he doesn't share some of their views. I don't see how a male lead placing his family over his girl could be very romantic?Concluding thoughts and my 13th reasonThis is the worst book Sarah J Maas has ever written, and that’s saying a lot. From her worthless white feminism to the complete and utter mind-numbing torture I had to face through this Bible-length tome, I could not have thought of a worse thing to read. It’s sad because I truly love Nesta Archeron so much, but this book made it evident that Sarah Janet hates her and wants to give her the worst story ever. Also, Feysand baby had a stupid name. SorryEDIT:frequently asked questions so that you can stop asking them:Why would you read something you know you'll hate?It's a free country! Why did you read this entire review if you knew you would hate it? (Yes, I /am/ a miserable person. I enjoy writing hate reviews. I think it's funny)It's a fiction book, it doesn't need to be realistic.By mistreating mental illness and eating disorders in fiction you perpetuate the idea in real life. The thing is, writing about something is not an endorsement, but neither is it a condemnation. SJM could have written about these situations in a way that was respectful, but, at least in my opinion, she completely missed the mark. I'm not saying she shouldn't have written about Nesta's mental health and weight issues. I'm saying that the way she wrote about them made it seem like they were just...her fault? Do you know what I mean? Like, as someone who has received comments about my weight many times, I felt deeply uncomfortable by how people treated her.If that's what you think then what do you think about... (enter character/ship I didn't mention)?I like Gwen? I don't have any further thoughts.Do you think having mental illness excuses someone to be a bad person?Mental illness is an explanation, not an excuse. It /explains/ why Nesta wants to be left alone. It /explains/ why she has a hard time being around anyone in the Inner Circle. It /explains/ her complicated feelings toward them. Nesta was already a mean person before this book—the actual question is whether or not any of her rude behaviorneedsto be excused in the first place. And that's for you to think on. Personally, I don't care.What Red Velvet song?All of them!""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5 - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️It feels like coming home after a long journey.That is precisely what I feel whenever I read aSarah J Maasbook. WhileThrone of Glassis my favorite series butACOTARis special to me. It helped me during one of the most difficult periods of my life and in particular,ACOMAF.I have no words to describe the beautiful familiarity of returning to a world you know you have always missed.I swear I could almost feel the gentle breeze of Velaris caressing me, welcoming me back while knowing that the story will start from a very dark place.Because this isNesta\'sstory.In the beginningAnd in the endThere was DarknessAnd nothing more.I will be writing two sections of the review soon:• a non-spoiler section that will come first• a spoiler section because I DO need to highlight some points.----------Non-spoiler review----------Nesta\'shealing journey was not a smooth one. I did not expect it to be. She clawed her way out of the the darkness that engulfed her ever since she had turned into a Fae.For her to heal, Nesta had to rip her soul apart to find her self again.I will tell you that I disliked Nesta so much in the ACOTAR books, I just kept a tight hold on the grudge against her.But Nesta is not a person that was meant to be liked. She is vicious and her sharpest weapon has always been her tongue. She could inflict a wound so deep with a mere word. But I came to realizeNesta is the most ""human"" character among all of them.Humanity does not equal good morals necessarily, Nesta is heavily flawed and her flaws are what makes her human.She is guilt-ridden to the point she allows her guilt to rot within her, poisoning most of the traits that makes her a good person. She carries such a deep disdain towards herself that she acts on it and you often see it in the form of lashing words.Why does she allow this to happen to her? Because she holds onto one belief:She deserves it.When I started seeing Nesta\'s soul more clearly after she began to tear it open, I felt my soul resonate with hers to the point that I cried.She was a prisoner in her own head, reliving certain deaths and nightmares that she can no longer see the light in the world. She can no longer see the goodness in her.It was powerful. It was raw. It was ugly.It was devastatingly beautiful in a way.That is what Nesta\'s healing looked like. She was such a damaged person inside that she gave up on the hope of healing herself.Does that mean all is forgotten about Nesta\'s past behavior? About the fact that she hurt and wronged many people? That she at many moments was a horrid person?The answer is No, and this is what makes Nesta\'s healing journey so impactful and emotional.Her trauma after the Cauldron and the War wrapped its adamant chains around her. The devastating war still haunts her and pulls her back from that light at the end of the tunnel where her family await her, a family that are bent on believing that she chose to remain in the darkness.No one was willing to go deep into the darkness to her and gift her a fragment of light that will guide her steps out.No one was willing to go as far as to shatter those chains and spare her from that misery.No one except forCassian.Nesta and Cassian\'s romance was maddening, passionate and wild.They were feral with each other, they were mad for one another, they were perfect for each other. I expected no less of them.Sarah J Maaswas not kidding when she mentioned that this was the filthiest book she has written so far.I was very impressed with her writing style, I really enjoy seeing an author\'s journey throughout the years and how much they grow. Of course, ACOSF comes with its own set of flaws and issues but it does not ruin the overall experience for me.If it shredded my emotions, if it made me cry, if my heart felt attached to this world after turning the very last page. It deserves a 5-star rating from me regardless of the issues and flaws that I will highlight in the spoiler section.Not to mention now that I adore Nesta, I adore the person she had become in the end and this is coming from a person that never liked her in the previous books.A Court of Silver Flamesis sexy, emotionally gripping and powerful.WARNINGI will go into detail about the book in the other section of this review below which will contain MAJOR SPOILERS, so please this is a heads up for those that have not read the books to not continue further unless they are willing to be spoiled.--------MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD--------Spoiler-review:The following review will be summed up in points because this is the best way to sort my thoughts and make sure I left nothing out.Yes people I am about to let it all out.Also, this is my own experience and my opinion should not be treated as a fact. To each of us their own unique reading experiences. I do not want to ruin anyone\'s experience and I do not want someone to ruin mine.So, let\'s get on with it!*ACOSF\'sbackbone wasNestaand her found family:Gwyn and Emerie. I adore their precious bond and the fact that they are badass female characters whom are also passionate readers of smutty romances. I love that Nesta found other friends outside the IC, they all found something in each other and helped one another heal.* TheHouseis my new favorite character.* Unpopular opinion but I am glad to seeRhysandplaying the High Lord role. Of course we\'d find him to be more broody since we are no longer seeing him fromFeyre\'sperspective, we are seeing him in his true element. I\'ve noticed that a few readers said they didn\'t like Rhys in this book, well.. Rhysand isn\'t the epitome of perfection many make him out to be and I appreciate that because he is heavily flawed too and yes I do like Rhysand.* My heart bursts with so much love forCassian! He wasn\'t without flaws too but I finally saw the raw version of him.* Although I was in no rush to seeFeyre\'spregnancy, yet it warmed my heart because Feyre deserves that kind of happiness after everything she went through. Of course I cried when she announced that she was pregnant I already suspected it early on.* It\'s refreshing to see theInner Circlefrom two other perspectives especially Nesta\'s and their treatment of her as if she was a hopeless case. Not saying that Nesta wasn\'t at fault here but they too are not cutting her some slack.* I think in regards to theromanceI have a few things I want to address: there were some romantic scenes that felt repetitive from ACOMAF + the intimate scenes were sometimes spicy in a good way and sometimes sloppy with weird descriptions.* I loved seeingNesta\'sgrowth because it was beautiful and ugly at the same time and you can easily notice the shifting points in her healing.* I rolled my eyes at theNessianmating bond, sorry everyone. I let it slip because I grew fond of them both but I do not want the romance to always be attached to some invisible bond. It\'s supposed to be rare we already had that with Rhys and Feyre.* Theplotdid not feel stable, it felt like it went to so many different directions. I was kind of hoping there would be more politics and human queens involved but it\'s not like I wasn\'t happy to where it ended up.* I was missing the open-conversation I was looking forward to between Nesta and the Inner Circle, both acknowledging their wrongs.* The rareRed starblasting through the sky that rattled Rhys, freaked out Cassian and the Priesstesses is none other thanAelin!.* Can we talk about the fact thatHelionwanted to enter the Night Court in a Golden Chariot led by four white horses with manes of golden fire and Rhys was like no so he settled for a Pegasus still having the best entrance of any character in the book.* the whole High King situation is a big No No. I love the dynamic of the Seasonal and Solar Courts and that what makes Prythian unique. Making Rhys a High King would ruin that and the fact that each Court is associated with its High Lord\'s power. I\'ve had it with Rhys beingthe most powerful high lord in historyso I do not need him to be upgraded to a High King especially not with using weapons that are the products of Nesta\'s power. That\'s giving Rhys way more power.* The scene that hit me the most was when Nesta let it all out. I cried because I am familiar with that level of self-loath.* I cried at the scene when Feyre was giving birth, it was intense and so emotional. Deep down I knew SJM wouldn\'t just end it here but it did not stop my heart from breaking.* The aftermath was so precious.* I do not mind thatNestalost the power she took from the Cauldron. She will lead the Valkyries whom she revived with her two other friends. She will grow even stronger without relying on powerful magic that makes her a target of other enemies. Her power has been a heavy weight lifted off her shoulders, and she gave them away in the most emotional and beautiful way.* Unpopular opinion: I have no issues withAzriel\'s POVbecause this is the first time we are exposed to his thoughts and he definitely was not OOC. Azriel is not some dark cinnamon roll, he is a deep inner turmoil. I find his notion of love and thoughts of Elain to be unhealthy. He has no experience with love besides the 500 year old unrequited love for Mor which brings me to ask... how come Az would get over Mor, his 500 year old crush just for Elain? They have not even spoken about their feelings. Anyhow, I do believe Azriel to be at a very dark place and it saddens me that many readers disliked him after this. Azriel has always kept to himself, he was never brought into the light, he does not know what love truly is. Having an Archeron sister does not guarantee the happiness his brothers found, this is a very wrong mindset.* Yes, I\'ve said it before and I\'ll say it again:Azrielneeds a ray of sunshine kind of character and we find that inGwyn. I think she is perfect for him and there is a reason SJM gave her the spotlight in his POV. Her name literally means happiness, blessing, white, fair while Az\'s is God is my help and Azrael the Angel of Death. Such a stark contrast, like yin and yang.* I hope SJM won\'t useGwyn, a SA survivor, as a plot-device for Elriel and then discard her that is too cruel.* Yes, not all Illyrian brothers should end up with every Archeron sister so I\'ll be rooting for Azriel and Gwyn in the next book.* Also, many people calledRhysa hypocrite for his actions with Azriel. No, what he did makes sense and he is pulling rank because this is how Rhys asserts his role as High Lord with a responsibility toward his court. Az ignored the Mor question, Az did not express his love or feelings towards Elain only his desire to have her and I\'m pretty sure there would\'ve been a different reaction from Rhys if Az told him that he genuinely loves her. With a baby on the way, Rhys won\'t risk any more conflicts that targets him and his family nor will he risk alliances with the other courts because of Azriel. How many times throughout the books did Rhys ask something of Azriel like to stop spying or not engage in a battle and he refuses until Rhys pulls the High Lord act on him and tells him that\'s it\'s anorder, people forget how stubborn Azriel can be.* I appreciate the fact that this book gave us a new perspective to theInner Circleand their flaws. I still adore them.I may add points later on, I\'m not quite sure I covered everything but I hope I did.Another note I would add is please be careful with posting spoilers in the comments. Try to be vague about it because it will still show on Goodreads feed to other readers that haven\'t read the book.Remember that this is my own personal experience of the book and my own personal opinions that in no way invalidate your own, so please do not invalidate mine if you do not agree with it.ACOMAF remains at the top but ACOSF managed to take over the second place, I will definitely be rereading it some time in the future.This is the longest review I have written so far, so thank you for sticking around.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '*This review contains no spoilers.*(very scared and had to edit my review after i pressed control + f and saw how many times i used the word ""fuck""). i have grammatically de-fucked this review. enjoy.)Ranting and RavingLet\'s get one thing clear: I am a hard core SJM fan. I have read and loved every book this woman has ever written. But can I be real a second? This book was shit, and I hated everything.CharactersI hatedevery single personin this book. Well, except Azriel (he can have me any day). But everyone else can die.I don\'t understand how you can make a fantastic, wonderful trilogy about love, friendship, healing, and everything beautiful in this world, and then come out with a disgusting, trashy, smutty ""romance"" that has absolutely no plot, shitty character growth,and an overall shitty book.Not to mention the cover. What is that, anyway??? An orange mask? A tiger?SJM took her perfectly developed characters and pretty much just let them rot. From the first three books, I loved every single person. Everyone. Now I hate Feyre. I hate Rhysand. I hate Cassian. I hate Amren. I hate Mor. For ** sake, IdespiseElain. Why is she a character? Why does sheexist? What does she add to the book? What role does she play, other than to collect people’s sympathy and make them feel sorry for her? I’m sorry (not), butElain is a ** idiot.I cannot STAND this hoe. Sarah, please write her death. I can\'t deal with her constant whining and bitching, running to Rhys and Cassian and telling them she wants to go back to the human world, just because of Nasty Nesta. Elain, you\'ve been living with your sister your entire life, and you choosenowto complain about how much of a bitch she is? Where were you the past eighteen years? Please, sweetie, grow a spine.I loved Feyre and Rhysso much(note *past tense*). I would\'ve done anything for them. Now I despise them with every atom in my body. The entire book is just themfucking, and Rhys bragging to Cassian that they’re fucking. And nowFeyre and Rhys have a childand now my life is over. I hated this book. I hated everything. No way I\'ve already mentioned that.On to the next bitch of the month: Cassian. Why the ** do I hate Cassian now (who I ADORED in ACOTAR)? For a simple question, there\'s an equally simple answer. Mostly because Cassian doesn\'t know how to keep his ((())) in his pants, and all he can think about is Nesta sUcKinG it and fUckInG it and doing whatever kinky shit they did that I can\'t even mention with a straight face. I hate you, Cassian. Ihateyou. Get me characters whose livesdon\'trevolve around their OTP and who think about thingsotherthan fucking, bucking and yucking the love of their life. Which—not to mention—Cassian and Nesta don\'t even seem to love each other. It\'s all about the rElEaSe for them, because apparently, these fictional bitches have so much sexual tension that they can\'t help rubbing up on each other every twenty ** pages. Bye. Every one of you nasty lil bitches disgust me.Wait, you\'restillnot done talking about the shitty characters? No bitch I\'m really not, because I\'m so angry at how many trees died for this pathetic book.The next shitty character I’ll be talking about is none other than Amren the hoe and Mor the bird. I honestly feel a little bad talking shit about them just because I adored them so much in the trilogy, but this shit has got to betalkedabout!Heads-up to all those authors out there: when you are describing a character and how pOwErFuL they are, please. please.pleasedo not get other powerful characters to ""shiver"" or ""pale"" when they are around the character you want to MAKE powerful. It is the cringiest thing I have ever read in my life. It’s so painful. Come up with some unique way to describe their power and make readers admire them, NOT get powerful characters like Amren to ""shiver"" and Rhys to ""pale"" when they are around Nesta. I don\'t necessarilyhateMor and Amren, but they’ve become so ** irrelevant in the fourth book that there\'s really no point talking about them anymore.Character ArcThe character growth in this book actually made me laugh. It was so minimal that it was astonishing. It was just Nesta apologizing to everyone because she realized everyone ** hated her guts and she had no one to go to. How can apologies possibly show character growth? I agree, Nesta\'s bitchy behavior throughout the book was inexcusable. However, that was why I liked her.It would\'ve been better if she continued being the bitchy little shit she was, but rushing her character growth towards the last 100 pages is stupid and inexcusable and straight up lazy, and it was a complete waste of my time.Love InterestNow let\'s get into why the ** I hate Rhysand\'s guts. Mind you, I used to love this hoe. I would’ve died for him. Now? I’m just glad I was never faced with that decision. If I was in Prythian, I would rather breathe raid smoke than the same air as him.First, Rhys is the only form of character growth in this entire book. I\'m sorry, did I say character growth? I meant characterdepletion. Rhysand has accomplished it, y\'all. He has accomplished his Unbecoming. Where was that sweet, kind, playful man that helped heal Feyre and helped her and everyone around him? Where the ** did he go, because I sure couldn\'t find him.Throughout the book he also brags to Cassian about fucking Feyre nonstop. You have sentences like:""\'Feyre initiated this round.\' Cassian could hear the pure male satisfaction in Rhys\' voice as he said it.""""I dismissed the maids bc I don\'t want them hearing what we\'re up to.""Cassian, laughing: ""Give the poor female a break""Rhysand: ""We\'re taking a break.For now."" (Did this bitch really just sayfor now?)But really though, why the FUCK is this necessary? Does Sarah J. Maas think it\'s attractive for a male to talk about his partner like that? What has she done to perfectly amazing characters? I am confusion? And disappointment? Now he is an egotistical jerk, a typical overprotective alpha male (*coughs* did someone say Rowan? - I despised him in EoS), and a ** shitty ass friend.I wouldn\'t go so far to say that ACOTAR was one of my favorite fantasy series ever, but it was definitely up there. Now, it is down there. I don\'t ever want to read about these thirsty whores ever again.PlotHold up, there was a ** plot? Unfortunately, there was nothing in this book resembling anything of the sort. There was no plot whatsoever, to the point that there weren\'t even any plot holes. In order to have plot holes, you must havesomesemblance of a plot. I was justwaitingfor some crazy SJM shit to go down, for her to pull some astonishing bullshit on us, for some hoe to declare war on another hoe. But then the book just ended. And I was confused. I didn\'t understand. I thought someone had ripped the last 200 pages from the back of my book. Alas, it was not my book\'s fault. It was the author\'s.Additional PointsI woke up at 9:38 AM to write this hateful review because the hate is overwhelming. I wanted to die reading this. Nesta is oh-so-powerful because her power is ""pure death,"" as Rhys puts it. I couldn\'t stand this. The only person that was tolerable in the slightest was Azriel, who I would probably marry. But everyone else in this book has turned shitty and disgusting. The other character who Isort oflike is Nesta, who everyone says is a selfish bitch, but that\'s really the only reason why I like(d) her.I was going to reread ACOMAF and the rest of that damn series before I started this book, but now I can\'t even bring myself to, because then I\'ll just end up remembering the utter failure that was ACOSF. I\'m not putting up with these characters anymore. Y\'all can all die and I would laugh. Which is certainly a surprise, since I balled my eyes out when I thought Rhys was dead in ACOWAR. Now Imyselfwould brandish the knife on him. I’d gladly throw him in that ** cauldron while cackling and sit there watching that bitch burn (that sounds really evil and i should delete this sentence but i won’t because i’m feeling resentful and bitter)Overall, i you\'re looking for a book with some steamy, smutty romance, then by all means, this might end up being your favorite book! But for those of us who have brains and who are sensible human beings and actually likecontentin a book, with likable characters, a plot driven story ... go home. Get your money back. Don\'t even get yourself hype for this book. I walked down that path, and honestly, there is no going back.And trust me, I know how popular SJM is. I can\'t scroll through the GR homepage without seeing some unsuspecting victim starting ACOSF. People probably won\'t stop talking about it for the next few months, which is unfortunate, because it\'s trash. I genuinely feel like this dumb shit is overshadowing some really top-tier books, so I\'m going to redirect y\'all to my favorite series of all time,An Ember in the Ashes. Read all four books, it\'ll do you some good, especially after shit like ACOSF fucks with your sanity. AEITA will put this trashy, slutty book to shameful tears.-1,000 starsCheck out my new blog'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '1 STAR.Nesta Acheron is the only interesting character that SJM has ever managed to write and yet she was treated like complete and utter shit throughout this whole book.THIS IS NOT A REVIEW OF THE STORY BUT INSTEAD A DISCUSSION OF SJM’S HORRIBLE “FEMINISM” AND HOW SHE DID NESTA ARCHERON DIRTY.SPOILERS BELOW.I knew before even starting this book that I would dislike the journey that SJM had obviously planned for Nesta but I elected to power through because I genuinely liked Nesta’s character and she resonated with me on a personal level. I shouldn’t have.Within the first few chapters of this book, I was already infuriated beyond belief. Not even 20 pages into the damned thing and we have Cassian, who is worried about thin and unhealthy Nesta has gotten when he suddenly goes off on a mental tangent about her “magnificent breasts”. What the fuck? Unfortunately for us all, this is not even the worst thing to happen to Nesta in the first chapter. We are immediately greeted with Nesta being furiously slut-shamed by her once-friend Amren and our captain feminist Rhysand agrees.“ “Though I bet it’s hard to look good,” Amren went on, “when you’re out until the darkest hours of the night, drinking yourself stupid and fucking anything that comes your way.” … Rhys seemed inclined to agree with Amren. “It seems Rhysand, who is famous for always LETTING women have a choice, does not agree when it comes to women he doesn’t like. Furthermore, Amren’s blatant slut-shaming is brushed off;“ - did Nesta notice the faint glimmer of worry in Amren’s smoky eyes-understand how rare it was? ”Who literally gives a shit. I don’t care if this is the first time Amren has ever been concerned for someone, you don’t say that type of shit to your supposed friend.Poor Nesta is then evicted from her home and ordered into doing what Feyre and Captain Feminist Rhysand want or she will be forced into the human world where she has no place and would be shunned. Some sister, huh? Not only this but Feyre and Rhysand take it upon themselves to tear down a whole block of APARTMENTS where PEOPLE LIVE just because they don’t like that Nesta stays there. SJM has not even tried to stop her privilege from seeping through her characters and if I didn’t already loathe Rhysand I would most definitely be leading the mob to his door at this point. And so Nesta is forced to obey Mr “You always have a choice” Rhysand and attend training with Cassian.We’ll skip a few chapters; Cassian whines and lusts and does a remarkable performance as a “Nice Guy” tm until Nesta insults his precious perfect High Lord and he tells that her everybody hates her. Everybody. Now, it’s remarkably obvious to even the characters in this god forsaken story that Nesta has been struggling after the war (after all it was the supposed reason they sent her away) and yet dear old Cassian gets upset that Nesta doesn’t like his bitch of a High Lord and tells her that everyone hates her. Everyone, you can assume, includes her sisters and himself. This gets resolved in typical SJM style with a “I didn’t mean it, I was angry” apology that is literally faker than me in my online lectures.We move on to some sort of conflict and Rhysand and Co. decide to “ask” Nesta to do something incredibly dangerous, the last time she had done it resulted in the capture of her younger sister Elain. Of course, Nesta doesn’t exactly want to do that and so our quirky inner circle quickly remind her that her aforementioned sister can do instead. The sister that Nesta would die to protect, that one? Yeah. And so, our lovely little Nesta is once more forced into doing what President Feminist wants because her only other option is to sacrifice her sister’s safety. But yeah, you always have a choice, right?Speaking of choices… time for the big one.It’s revealed to us that our darling couple Feysand are with child, cue cheers! Except, the baby has wings and giving birth to him will probably kill Feyre. Rhysand obviously goes around and makes everyone swear not to tell Feyre for… reasons? Captain Choice not telling his wife, mate whatever, that the child she’s carrying will pretty much kill her? Feminism.Now, this stays a secret for a while until Nesta finds out that the glamorous Inner Circle have been discussing her and taking votes on what is or isn’t essential for her to know about her own powers. So, Nesta’s pissed (as she very well should be) and has a confrontation that leads to her telling Feyre the truth about her little fae baby. Shock horror, Rhysand isn’t pleased. In fact, I believe his exact words were:“Get Nesta out of this city. Right now … Before I fucking kill her.”Charmer.Sure, Nesta only told Feyre the truth because she was angry and wanted to hurt her, but I hardly think Nesta is the villain in this situation. Yet she’s treated like one by everyone except Feyre (this is perhaps the only time Feyre has shown some sense). Not only that, Rhysand literally threatens to kill her. When I tell you, I had to put this book down because I was SO INFURIATED, I could barely breathe. If a man ever did that shit to me, he’d be dead in a ditch. But unsurprisingly, SJM pins the blame on Nesta.When I tell you, I could rant about SJM’s purported “feminism” for hours I am not lying. This review could go on for another 20 pages if I wanted to. However, spending that much energy on SJM would be a new low, even for me. So, a wrap-up.A Court of Silver Flames is potentially the worst book I have ever read, especially in terms of character development. We start with Nesta, traumatised and lashing out, and what do we finish with? A Nesta who had to go and beg for everyone’s forgiveness and nobody, not once, apologised to her despite everything I’ve just discussed. I think maybe Feyre apologised once and Rhysand buys her dresses at the end like … are you SHITTING me?!Throughout this story, Nesta finds her own little group of friends and this is probably the only good thing about this stupid fucking book. Nesta’s friendship with two other women was surprisingly heart-warming at times and perhaps the only thing SJM did not screw up completely.This book was a complete and utter fucking monstrosity and I sincerely hope SJM never writes another book again.Fuck you,Allana'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4.25 stars“So Nesta had become a wolf. Armed herself with invisible teeth and claws, and learned to strike faster, deeper, more lethally. Had relished it. But when the time came to put away the wolf, she\'d found it had devoured her too.”I am irrationally annoyed by how much I enjoyed this.I read the reviews and was prepared to snicker my way through the purring, the ridiculous sex scenes, and constant assertions of ""my mate."" However *sigh* this series just does something to my cold cynical heart. I laugh at it, but I am incapable of hating it.So take my hand, lovelies. Let us venture into my detailed thoughts, which I have thoughtfully assembled into a list with no discernible pattern or theme:-Nesta is so bitchy sometimes. I get that it\'s complex and there\'s a certain feminism in portraying someone like her as a protagonist instead of a villain, but jeez, girl. Learn some basic manners. I occasionally wonder if SJM went too far in making Nesta the selfish stepsister in ACOTAR. It\'s hard to shake off that image. She does attempt to justify it in this book by explaining that Nesta was angry at her father for giving up and not providing for his daughters. Nesta was ready to let them all starve to prove a point-Rhys says to Nesta, “Of course you have a choice. You always have a choice here,” like he didn’t force Nesta out of her flat, force her to live in one of his residences where she can\'t leave, force her to train with Cassian, force her to work at the library, etc. Surely there are better ways to stage an intervention. I know they did it out of love, but Tamlin did what he did out of love, too-Speaking of, everyone hates Tamlin because he gave Nesta and Elain to the King of Hybern (which he did to save Feyre), but when Rhys threatens to kill Nesta if she hurts Feyre, that’s somehow okay.Nesta literally had to flee for her life after telling Feyre the truth about her pregnancy-Rhys and Feyre are supposedly equals, but he refuses to tell Feyre about the dangers of her pregnancy. Nesta is portrayed as the bad guy for telling her sister the truth-Can we stop worshiping Rhys now? Please?-I like that Nesta asks Cassian how he likes his blowjob. It normalizes communication during sex-SJM is too lazy to think of actual names for magical places and items. Under The Mountain sounds ominous if you think about it, but then there’s the Harp, the Mask, and the Crown-Ireally liked Nesta\'s character arc: her struggle with trauma and depression, her cold rage at her father for refusing to provide for them and the steel pride that prevents her for apologizing to Feyre for her past behavior, the self-loathing and insecurity, the female solidarity with other victims of sexual assault and misogyny. On that last note, I\'ve never understood why Nesta and Elain were so upset with being being transformed into beautiful, powerful High Fae back during ACOWAR. SJM explains it more by linking the violent act of being forced inside the Cauldron and changed against her will with rape/sexual assault.-While I adore the themes mentioned above, SJM writes the same arc over and over. All of her female protagonists (Aelin, Feyre, that girl from House of Earth and Blood) wrestle with crippling depression at some point. She recycles plots and characters and writing phrases. Gets pretty old-The ending is thematically confusing.Nesta and her friends are thrown into the Illyrian Rite of Passage thing, which has traditionally forbidden female warriors because sexism. They get through it together without magic, symbolically smashing the patriarchy. This ties in with all the themes ACOSF has been pushing.Feyre\'s childbirth near the end is where it gets confusing. Both Feyre and her kid die, but Nesta saves them by stopping time and bargaining with Death (or the Cauldron, can\'t remember). She alters the shape of Feyre\'s pelvis so a kid with wings can pass through and transforms hers as well for her far-off future kid with Cassian. In exchange, Nesta gives up some of the power she took from the Cauldron, but gets to keep a little because God forbid a SJM character is anything less than overpowered.Thematically, the childbirth scene doesn\'t make sense in terms of the book\'s overall plot. What is the implication? That women have to sacrifice power in order to have kids? That doesn\'t fit the whole feminist angle.Maybe the scene can be interpreted as Nesta finally repairing her bond with Feyre? ASOSF has seen Nesta feeling disconnected from her family (guilt over her dead father, anger towards Elaine for supposedly turning her back on her, both rage and guilt regarding Feyre). Here, Nesta is restoring family by saving her sister and nephew\'s lives. She communes with the Mother, the harbringer of life. It contrasts her power of death, which is connected to her feelings of rage and desolation. Nesta believes she is too prickly to love, but through her hand (and better mental health), life blooms.That\'s a better interpretation than SJM had a baby in real life and wanted to work in motherhood somewhere. Also, Feyre has been resurrected twice now. Another three stamps and you get a free ice cream scoop at Scoops Ahoy!My review of A Court of Thorns & RosesMy review of A Court of Mist & FuryMy review of A Court of Wings and RuinMy review of A Court of Frost and Starlight'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Did I read this 757-page novel in one day?Yes.Do I have any regrets?No.This was my most anticipated book of the year, which is shocking.It's no secret that I don't like this series.ACOMAF and ACOWAR had basically no plot. Rhys and Feyre are annoying to me because they are perfect and have no flaws and that's boring. I literally could not care less about any of the other characters besides Nesta, Cassian, and Azriel. SJM also uses repetitive language, and I swear she gets paid per ellipsis. There are many things I don't like about these books.But dang it, are they entertaining! And I would be lying if I didn't say that I shipped Cassian and Nesta like I never have anyone before!I was so ready for this ship to sail. And now that it has, I gotta say, I'm disappointed. I wantedmore. I can't even tell you what I wanted more of. I just wanted more of it. I think I hyped this up in my mind so much that there was no way it could ever live up to it. I wasn't consumed by the romance the way I wanted to be.I wanted an epic love story and I didn't get one.The whole romance felt 'meh' to me, which sucks since it's the main reason I read this book. I wanted the angst, the longing, the pining, the yearning! You romance readers know what I'm talking about. Instead, I got a lot of sex scenes. And while I don't mind it, I wanted more romance than sex. It didn't live up to my expectations.I also liked but didn't love the characters. I used to love Nesta, and while I liked her growth and seeing her overcome her trauma, she didn'tfeellike the Nesta I liked so much in ACOWAR. Maybe it's just my disappointment, but she and Cassian felt off to me. Just slightly out of character when compared to what I'd seen before. Then again, people are different from different perspectives.Having seen it all before from Feyre's POV means that we got a biased, not necessarily accurate representation of who they are.That brings me to the fact that I actually liked the Inner Circle more in this book than before. I still don't love them and think they're all lowkey horrible in their own way, but I was more ok with them. Maybe because unlike Feyre, who saw them as perfect people who could do no wrong, Nesta isn't afraid to point out their flaws. Unfortunately, Cassian is blind to the fact that Rhys has flaws at all. It bothered me so much how angry and borderline violent he'd become whenever Nesta mentioned she didn't like Rhys. I also hated how Cassian was so unbothered when Rhys threatened to kill his mate. I kept waiting for Cass to stand up for Nesta in front of Rhys. It didn't happen. I don't know why everyone in this series insists on acting like Rhys is the greatest thing since sliced bread.All of that said,I did enjoy watching Nesta come into her own, and find happiness with her new friends.\xa0I also loved Nesta's relationship with the House.\xa0The House and Nesta is a friendship I didn't know I needed. By far the best relationship in the book.!!!THE FOLLOWING IS A SPOILER!!!I hate that Nesta had to lose her power. She was death incarnate and could wield insanely powerful objects as no one else could. Then it was taken away. It's like SJM didn't want her to be a match to the ever-perfect and powerful Rhys. Same with Amren in ACOWAR. Why can't powerful women stay powerful? Also, while I'm all for girl power, Nesta and her friends shouldn't have won the Blood Rite. How do girls who have been training for three months win against warriors that have been training for years? It makes no sense.!!!SPOILER OVER!!!Also, this had a weak plot.All of the books in this series do if I'm honest. It's definitely a character-focused novel. The plot feels distant from the story. It's worse because the plot of this is very obviously a setup to other novels. The villain in this story was irrelevant, they didn't even make an appearance until the end.It feels like the introductory book in a series,which I suppose it is, but I still didn't like it. This made the book feel longer than it was, and it was already pretty gosh darn long (not that it stopped me from reading it in one go).Overall, this book was OK. Nothing more. Nothing less. I am still eagerly awaiting Azriel's book.Also!! Apparently, Feyre doesn't suck at painting! Shocking right! This is the first time that her paintings were described in detail and people actually commented on their beauty rather than just vaguely acknowledging them. In my mind she still sucks though.Ok, now I'm about to get controversial. Don't come for me, I don't have the energy for it.Apparently, all the SJM haters have been bullying people for buying this book because it's not diverse enough? WTF.If you don't want to read this book, don't. If you don't want to buy this book, don't. If you're mad because the author is writing the story she wants with the characters she wants, go read other books. It's truly that simple.Don't bully people for spending their money how they want and for reading what they want.\xa0As far as I know, Sarah J. Maas hasn't disrespected anyone in her books. Sure, her books are hella white. But if it bothers you, go read more diverse books. Don't be an asshole to people who want to read this. And don't be a hypocrite and tell people that you don't support the story but then say you're gonna pirate it because you're still interested in reading it.Read it or don't. That's all there is to it.- Sincerely, a person of color who is entirely impartial toward SJM""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Whilst ACOMAF will always remain elite, ACOSF is superior in my eyes.Yeah, I said it. 🤷🏾\u200d♀️Especially in terms of the mental health representation.Especially in terms of character study and growth.And the girls that get, absolutely fuckin’ get it!Nesta’s arc was incredibly well done.I really fuckin’ like that she wasn’t likeable.We get a lot ofheroesthat are as much of a dick as Nesta is.

Many things about Nesta made sense to me.The negative self-talk, the toxic mentality, her viciousness and cold-hearted nature felt deeply relatable.Her depression is relatable!She had an armour of the biggest kind and it was impenetrable.Nesta is a character that’s unique.You have either experienced her in some capacity or you cannot relate and thus, do not understand.Her pain was painted vividly, it was jarring.There’s no saving someone that’s in the business to self-destruct and it was conveyed beautifully, albeit depressing to read.At the same time, it felthealingto be surrounded by all of her.I love Sarah J. Maas for writing this story. ♥️CW: depression, suicidal ideation, sexual assault, loss of a parent, grief, parental abuse.———————————————🔥 ORIGINAL REVIEW 🔥""So Nesta became a wolf. Armed herself with invisible teeth and claws, and learned to strike faster, deeper, more lethally. Had relished it. But when the time came to put away the wolf, she\'d found it had devoured her, too.""Just out of respect for this book, I feel like I should be going through a mourning phase, sit with this story a little while longer and let it simmer, rather than trying to move on. I can\'t even begin to tell you how much of a therapeutic reading experience this was.It had all the SJM trademarks, great friendships, great emphasis on found families, great character development, and even greater sex. Of course.I\'d call this Part 2 toA Court of Mist and Fury. It echoes that book very much in terms of the themes discussed, i.e. depression and going through the process of healing from trauma, which she very much highlights is never linear.With Nesta that depression took on a different, more aggressive form:•\tNesta is a stone-cold bitch. I relate.•\tHer anger was fierce. I relate.•\tShe pushed people away with her attitude. On purpose. I relate.•\tLack of self-worth. I relate.•\tExtreme discomfort to emotions so anger is the easiest option. I relate.Do we see a pattern developing here?”Did she count–was she worth being counted? It was the question that sent everything crumpling inside her.”She had every right to be one (anyone that has carried this much anger and depression on their shoulders knows how much this weighs you down and debilitates you), though I initially hated how her anger would attack anyone that remotely showed any care. But your circumstances shape you. Trauma leaves an imprint. Hurt people hurt people. She was trapped in a vicious cycle of self-loathing and hatred and grief and it took a tremendous toll on her mental well-being. All due to her dysfunctional childhood, her body being invaded without permission and being thrust into a world she was conditioned to hate.I could write essays on Nesta’s character. I adore what Sarah J Maas did with this. There was so much attention to detail when it came to Nesta’s overall well-being, all which attributed to her growth and healing and it blew me away. It became about the little things, celebrating the small growths, embracing setbacks and moving forward in your own way and your own time.This is very much a character driven book, which is probably why I loved it so much. I’ll take that over plot any day, especially when it’s done well. However, there is a plot present. The world-building become even more epic in this book. It was so much more solid, since it was built upon from the other books in the series. I mean, that House? I want one!I didn’t want this book to end – it could’ve been longer. This almost felt like an extensive prologue. We just got to see the cusp of her capabilities asNestaand I’m craving more of her. It was incredible to see her personality come forth and shine through, behind all the layers she hid behind for so, so long.———————————————TITLE! 😭😭😭😭 I can’t believe we get to go back to this world again soon.

Still human, and I nearly went to my knees before you."" His breath caressed the shell of her ear and she couldn’t stop her eyes from fluttering shut. His smile brushed against her temple. ""Your power is a song, and one I’ve waited a very, very long time to hear, Nesta.""I didn’t have a clue how much I would love this damn book! It’s my favorite out of all of the series so far.I’ve been deeply hurt mentally and physically in my life. I used to be in a fighting school until my physical/medical shit has mostly taken things away from me. I have a couple real life girl friends, but nothing like this book, oh how I wish!! So, this book hit all of the feels for me!Nesta is an asshole, but she has some reasons with mental trauma - I can relate - I’ve got a lot of mental issues myself but not for the same reasons.I loved the fighting and strengthening scenes, I so much loved this in my life and miss it tremendously. I love the girl friends made and the girl empowerment in the book. These women went through hell!!I love Cassian so much. I love Nesta! I love all of the family and I love that damn house! Oh if I could have a house like that!!I love some of the things Sarah said in the acknowledgments.This book made me cry tears of sadness and happiness!The strength these women showed through the help of Nesta and Cas and Az were amazing. But ultimately they did it themselves. I love finding characters that are like this as I can try my hardest to be the same way. Among the many things I deal with I fight wanting to kill myself. It’s been really bad lately and I’m working with my doctors and my nature. These characters made me so happy, which I don’t have a lot of happiness and I’m so grateful. There’s only so much a person can hide about themselves trying to act all happy on the other side of the internet.Anyway, I loved this book dearly.And if it didn’t have enough action for you or was too smutty or written without certain characters and bullshit you wanted, f*ck off and write your own damn book and quit your damn bitching.

Hopes and prayers are answered!!!!""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'No one is a bigger Nessian stan than me...so imagine my surprise at this rating.This reviewWILL CONTAIN MAJOR SPOILERSso please read at your own risk if you haven\'t finished or picked up the book. But to adequately rant (like, truly rant) about all the ways this book didn\'t work for me we just need to air it all out without an vague mentions of what went down in this book.My biggest problem with this book started and ended with Rhys and Feyre. Y\'all, I truly doNOTcare about them anymore. They had their time to shine and they did...so can we please move on? The second I read about Rhys having his shield up around Feyre so no one could detect her scent I was 1000% sure she was pregnant and pissed the fuck off because I knew somehow this was going to circle all the way back around them. And sure enough Rhys went off to be an absolute piece of garbage and not tell Feyre that she would die delivering their child since it had wings. So, when NestaFINALLYhas her big moment to show how much she\'s grown as a character it\'s overshadowed by Feyre going into labor and almost dying. Which pissed me off in itself, however, I made it 730 pages and nearly put this book down because of how triggering it was. A warning would have been nice instead of having to read about a lifeless child being born because some of us have actually been dealt that shitty card in life and would rather not have to relive those moments. I was truly ready to vomit and ended up having to skim those pages.Next up, and almost just as disappointing was the romance between Nesta and Cassian. I have loved them since day one and was so looking forward to watch their love story unravel. On one hand, I loved the physical aspect of it. SJM upped her smut game for sure in this one but that\'s pretty much where it ended. There was something major missing between the two of them that left me feeling next to nothing for them and all the tension between the two of them in the prior books was so far out the window. Truly a letdown and please don\'t even get me started on how abysmally underwhelming the ""mate"" reveal was.Third, was Nesta\'s growth. Just like I loved Nesta and Cassian together, I loved Nesta by herself. She\'s always been one of my favorite characters in this series even when she was a shitty person. So, I was always looking forward to the day when we would get Nesta\'s story because she needed a major glow up growth wise and usually SJM is really great at writing good, solid growth in her characters. But again, this fell so short that majority of it just seemed physical instead of mental. While I\'m aware she has a lot of growing to do and this book was essentially her realizing that it leads me to wonder...did we really need 750 pages just to get to that point? I think not.The only, and when I say only I really mean it, thing I thoroughly enjoyed in this story was the ""Valkyrie"" training and the friendship that Nesta, Emerie, and Gywn had. I was flying through the part were the girls were thrown into the Blood Rite and cheering them on to make it all the way to the top of Ramiel. But that\'s basically it...and to get that little enjoyment in 750 pages is just a total fail for me.Of course, even though this book totally didn\'t cut it for me and left me beyond furious (Rhys & Feyre, I\'m looking at you) I\'m still a clown and will buy the next book when it comes out because I need to see what in the hell SJM is doing with these characters. Specifically Mor..why was she nonexistent this entire book? And Azriel... are him and Elain mates or not? Because I will riot if they are, he deserves so much more than miss garden girl.Okay, rant over 🙃'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""All the Stars ⭐️✨⭐️✨⭐️I know a lot of people don't like her...but Nesta is my favorite ACoTAR character, and has been since the end of book one/beginning book two.I love female characters who are unashamedly prickly...who have defensive outer shells and soft inner cores...who secretlycarethat people don't like them...but also simultaneously don't give a shit.Ever since Maas has been dangling the Nesta/Cassian pairing in front of us like so much chocolate, I have been dying for the focus to be on them.

It’s so unfair to the other books :((Quick Warning:Have an aspirin handy because what goes down in this book will mess with your heart.Reading this book felt like having a cold breeze brush my face after being out in the hot sun; of honey-ginger tea making its way down my sore throat. It gave me an adrenaline rush I don't think even confronting a Polar Bear would've given me.This book was definitely flawed and I wasn’t a huge fan of the plot (if there was one). Nesta and Cassian’s relationship however was like a weightless joy. Every conversation, every emotion had so much depth and every character grew in their own roundabout way.This book highlights the ramifications of the War with Hybern- Nesta's trauma and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. After losing her mother at a very young age, having to watch her father's neck being snapped right after he told her how much he loved her, being turned into a High Fae against her will, and the pain of almost losing her sister Elaine, broke something in her. Everybody has their own way of dealing with trauma. Nesta deals with it by building an invisible wall around herself and pushing away the people that love her the most by hurting them with her acid words.As she embarks on a journey towards self-development, she finds that the only one who can decimate the wall around her isCassian- A fierce Illyrian warrior and the General Commander of the Night Court.As her wall keeps degenerating over time, a deliciously romantic and sex-drenched relationship develops between them. There's obviously LOTS of steamy, ragingly passionate scenes but what is most appealing in their relationship is the minor displays of affection and the respect they have for each other and will set your soul on fire.They each challenge the status quo and reveal themselves to be stronger than anyone imagined through rigorous training and practice.I love howSarah J Maasredeemed Nesta's character in tiny steps and not like how she redeemed Rhysand in ACoMaF. Nesta's journey toward self-love wasn't smooth. She kept falling down, picking herself back up only to realize she fell deeper. This falling-down-climbing-back-up-thing went on for a while and it was so raw and real that my tear glands vowed to empty every drop from my body.For all those who hate Nesta after reading ACoFaS, let me tell you: I come from the same place. But do not let that stop you from reading this book because what's the worse that can happen, hmm? You will either hate it in which case you can always DNF it or get back to it later. But if you love it, then there's no stopping you from jumping around like a maniac. But if you don't even try, you will never know, will you?""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""“Forgiveness is not that easy.”“Forgiveness is something we also grant ourselves.”So did I really wait three years for ACOSF only to binge read it in 14 hours with 0 sleep? Yeah I did and it wasso worth it.And before you start looking for it in this review, yes we find out what was in the box and yes we find out if they are mates or not but no I will NOT spoil those in this review. I also included links to the bonus scenes at the bottom.SPOILERS BELOWSo I’m just gonna go ahead and say SJM fed us so good after almost three years! So many theories were proven and the filler chapters were giving me life. It’s perfect for those who’ve followed her series as they come out and have had to endure the torturous wait for more.But first thing’s first:what thehellhappened to the conflict that was building up in ACOFAS?I can’t have been the only one bamboozled with the way Sarah conveniently just resolved The One Big Thing that could have been the center of ACOSF. You should’ve seen my face when Cassian mentioned that Kallon DIED IN THE PREVIOUS RITE without a fuss. Like? What? Isn’t…that… why… we’re here…. ? No? Okay?And alsowhat happened to the “You’re coming with me to the Illyrian Mountains” bit?Again, another misdirection (for lack of a better word) on what we were expecting ACOSF to be. Soooo many people, me included, were expecting Nesta to move in with Cassian in a small cottage to actually live in the Windhaven Camp! I’m actually pretty sad that that didn’t come to pass BUT I’m not complaining with how things turned out.WITH THAT SAID;1. Put simply, the wait was worth it.I loved this book.I loved the plot.I loved NessianI loved the smut!!!!!!I loved the House of Wind.I loved Eris.I loved MOR (I know I’m surprised at how that turned out too).I loved Azriel-the-chaperone!“You two need a chaperone up here?”Yes. No. Yes. “I thought you were the chaperone.”Az threw him a wicked smile. “I’m not entirely sure I’m enough.”The full quote is even better than I could have hoped for!2. Another thing I love about ACOSF was the passage of time!The entire book spans about a little over a year, which justifies the crazy amount of events that happen in this behemoth of a book.Remember when the entire TOG series was said to have happened in onlyone year? Yeah I didn’t like that.3. I have a feeling that the red star that shot through the sky was Aelin falling through Prythian in KOA!PLEASE TELL ME YOU GUYS SAW IT TOO.“The mood hadn’t been helped by a rare red star blasting across the sky one day—an ill omen, Nesta had heard the priestesses muttering. Cassian reported that even Rhys had been rattled by it, seeming unusually contemplative afterward. But Nesta suspected that the omen wasn’t the only thing contributing to Rhys’s solemnity. Feyre was only two months from giving birth, and they still knew nothing about how to save her.”4. I’m just gonna take a minute here to talk about the smut.So ACOSF is officially an adult book and it shows in the smut! There is so much of it and I have only one complaint - that SJM did not flesh out a particular 34+35 scene. She no longer uses her oh-so-famous “velvet wrapped steel” innuendos. We go straight to the point with “cock” and even the word “cunt” now.It also goes without saying that the smut is decidedly more intense than what we've seen from her previous books. SJM was not kidding at all when she said she's descended into new levels of filthy when writing ACOSF.I did, however, still have some slight issues with the bookFor one, I didnotlove how Feysand hijacked certain parts of this book *cough cough the ending cough cough* It’s a Nessian book and yet Feysand is still the center of their world. No, I’m living in Nesta’s world. I want it to be all about her!I also had a slight disconnect with Nesta’s character although I can’t tell if she was acting out of character or if she was just grossly misrepresented in books 1-3 since we read it from Feyre’s POV. Nevertheless, I still love how she arced as a character and how she healed.START MAJOR SPOILERS SECTIONEnding spoilerI’m very sad that Nesta pulled an Aelin and lost majority of her powers in the end. I loved powerful!Nesta. I loved that everyone was afraid of her. I loved that she was rewriting Prythian history by merely existing. Gods that are older than Prythian itself were afraid of her. I hate how she gave that up in the end. What is it with women being rendered powerless in these books (Aelin and Amren)?Nesta spoilerI am also upset that Nesta ended up melding back with the IC? Everyone was expecting her to move out to Illyria and have her own family outside of the Night Court - I wanted that for her too. But, oh well.Azriel POV spoiler (Bonus scenehttps://drive.google.com/drive/folder...)I’m SO excited to see where his story goes.

It has all the tags and features: making you hate the canon main characters, an uncomfortable pregnancy, the incorporation of lore you didn’t ask for and don’t need, ridiculously toxic love interests, and an unnecessary 200,000 word count.Let’s talk about the High Lord of the Night Court, a character who was a villain, then an adored main character, and now a villain again. Rhysand is so violent and overprotective and his only personality trait is “I will shred you to bits if you touch or breathe on or think about Feyre.” He literally put a shield around her so even her friends couldn’t be around her. Rhysand is only respectful to women who are submissive to him and obey his authority. He was nice to Nesta only after she made a huge sacrifice at the end for his sake. He’s so bitter, and I don’t know why Feyre finds that attractive. I liked him before because he wasn’t overprotective. He let Feyre do what she wanted. But now…“Cassian knew [Rhysand would] shred anyone who so much as blinked wrong at Feyre into a million bloody ribbons.”lol.Feyre is just a decoration in this book. Although she does have power, we don’t see her use it like she did in the previous books. What happened to that important and empowering fight to make her High Lady? Now she has no agency.I’m especially angry because this is so out of character for the Inner Circle. Mor’s development horrified me in particular. She was abused badly in the Court of Nightmares, so she knows how terrible and sick they are. Azriel even describes the way she “savored every moment in the sun… as if the first seventeen years of her life, spent in the darkness of the Hewn City, still lurked around her.” But then Mor says this:Mor sipped her tea, the portrait of elegant innocence. “We’d be better off throwing Nesta into the Court of Nightmares. She’d thrive there.”What happened to the Inner Circle who accepted Feyre with open arms and helped her heal from her sorrow and trauma? Is Feyre’s grief more palatable to the Inner Circle than Nesta’s? The sisters process their hurt in different ways, but Rhysand acts like Nesta is an embarrassment to the family because of it, like they would be the perfect family if it weren’t for her. In contrast, Feyre gets all the support she needs. There are ways to build up new protagonists without turning the ones we already love into villains.I haven’t even talked about the worst part of the book yet: Feyre’s situation. (I think this was revealed pretty early in the book, so it isn’t a spoiler. But you can fast forward to the next paragraph if you don’t want to know.) Feyre is in the middle of a life-threatening pregnancy with a baby that could literally rip her apart. Guess who decides by committee that it would be better not to tell her this vital information about her pregnancy, her health, her life, and the baby inside her body. That’s right: Rhysand and the Inner Circle. A really important theme of ACOTAR is individual, personal freedom. But this threw that all away. I cannot describe how infuriated this made me. And when Nesta made the decision to tell Feyre that childbirth would kill her (a decision made out of spite, but still a good one for Feyre), the response from the other characters was bizarre. From what I remember, Feyre was upset but ultimately supported the Inner Circle’s decision to hide this from her, and Nesta was forcibly and emphatically rejected by her family. I can’t make this stuff up.Parts ofA Court of Silver Flameswere good, although they were few and far between. The Blood Rite was pretty cool. The tension and high stakes and character development and the way the Valkyries bonded in their struggle was amazing. I really liked Emerie and Gwyn, and I’m invested in their backgrounds and their journeys to come. They are refreshingly unproblematic and normal. They are easy characters to love.Besides the ending, the plot wasn’t very good. The search for the Crown/Harp/Mask felt arbitrary and too random for my taste. It also got sidetracked constantly, so it wasn’t satisfying to me. However, this gripe seems so minor compared to the rest of the dumpster fire that isA Court of Silver Flamesthat I don’t even care.“My mate” every other pageHas filled me with unending rageBreaking Dawn-esque pregnancyFeels like a fanfic fever dreamAzriel, he shadow-singsCas doesn’t have the longest wingsFeyre does interior designNesta walks a narrow lineGwyn and Emerie are true heroesCassian’s over five zero zeroSister’s sick? Don’t fret, just kissThrow me into the abyssDot dot dot, dash dash dashDown the stairs you crash crash crashBones will bark and eyes are darkRed flags are Rhys’s trademarkThe day I forget about this book will be a good day indeed.1.5 stars'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""✅Reread -Sept 2023This was a whole new reading experience. I got so much to say, so jumping right in.Why I rated it 1 star when I read it the first time-1. I read the whole series in one go instead of pacing myself or giving a break in between the ACOTAR world. Reading it immediately after ACOWAR and ACOFAS backfired. It led me to bebored.2. I thought it wastoo smutty.Which it still is fyi but this did not concern me in my reread oddly.3. I hadnot liked Nesta.Jumping straight from Feyre's journey was not an ideal decision. Feyre had a trilogy, so spending a lot of time with her compared to just one book of Nesta's did make an impact. I was still angry with Nesta and her treatment of Feyre.4. I simplyforgot about the majority of eventsthat were correlated to the Crescent City series when I made my GR account and rated it.Why I give it 5 stars now-1. Ipaced myself.Gave myself some time in between ACOWAR, AOCFAS and ACOSF. This worked brilliantly for me. There was proper balance.2. Idid not expect muchas I was concerned about how this reread will go. With my expectations low, the reread ended surprising me.3.I ADORED Nestathis time around. I found her journey admirable, relatable and far more understandable. Her struggles were portrayed in such a raw manner and the way she overcame them bit by bit was chef's kiss. I too, like the other characters had not given her a fair chance but when I did the way she blossomed into a wonderful character was worth rereading!! Nesta is such a badass and although I am not saying she was not wrong before (she was) but I understand now.I see Nesta Archeron, her being, and she is worthy.4.Romance and banterwas so fun. Cassian is such a softie and marshmallow at heart. I swear I just wanna give him a big bear hug.5. I loved reading about thepossibilities of different worlds connecting.There's so much that can happen.6. Theendingwas so emotional. I swear I was sobbing.Some things that might be controversial but I wanna state my take on it-1. I see people call Rhysand an arrogant asshole a lot in reference to his persona in this book.I disagree.Sure, he was harsh a bit but never arrogant, never an asshole. Rhys was always honest, never lying to anyone or Nesta. He has his mate to look after, his court to look after. People think that just cause he is Feyre's mate that's all there is to him. Wrong! Rhys is also High Lord. Trained to be a leader and warrior, he talks and acts like one. He doesn't have to act soft towards others he doesn't know well. And Nesta was that one person, he did not know.Just cause someone criticizes you, does not mean they are your enemy.The amount of hate Rhys gets is just uncalled for imo.2. This might not be so controversial butNesta's powers???The thing that happened at the end should not have happened. That's all I'll say to keep it spoiler free lol.Without elaborating much on my private life, I just wanna say- I felt Nesta's journey deeply and it resonated with me. There have been some changes in my own life since the last time I read this book and all I say to Nesta is, I get it.Man, I just had a completely new experience reading this lmao. Am sitting here as I draft my review, thinking wtf did I read the first time😂🙈~•~•~It's time to give Nesta another chance. The first time I read it, I thought it was kinda boring and too smutty (I know I know😭🫣) but hopefully this reread will be better.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Males and females, children darting amongst them, gawked at Nesta as she exited onto the street.

How strongly and personally it touched me.This is not an easy book to read and understand.I guess that part of its rawness and bittersweet tones are to blame on the fact that it's told from Nesta's pov, a character who was firstly written to be hated and who probably hates herself more than the audience ever could and eventually did.She's a very intense fictional person, and I'd lie if I said she didn't frustrate me to no end in more than one occasion.But I guess that's exactly what SJM wanted from this character.I could literally feel the self-hatred exude from the pages. The self-sabotaging, the way Nesta, who's never been a saint but who maybe was programmed to feel like she was one, denies herself everything that makes her feel even remotely worthy of light.I know how that feels, and I wanted to see what she would do to use her pain, her trauma and her past to mold herself into a new, damaged yet not spoilt, perpetually-evolving creature.I wasn't disappointed.I actually got more than I expected, because I eventually ended up falling in love with all the nuances this character possesses.Not one of them had offered to help save the Archeron family from poverty.They had thrown them all, mere children and a crumbling man, to the wolves.So Nesta had become a wolf. Armed herself with invisible teeth and claws, and learned to strike faster, deeper, more lethally. Had relished it. But when the time came to put away the wolf, she’d found it had devoured her, too.I must admit I never really was a fan of Nesta, but I didn't really ever hate her, either. I was simply indifferent to her and her antics, especially considering I knew being ACOTAR a Beauty and the Beast retelling, at least one of the sisters must be an asshole, and that's Nesta for you.I started getting interested in her as a character at the start of ACOWAR and, confession time, I mainly did it because of a pretty awesome Nessian fanart I've seen on instagram.Oh, don't judge me.The point is, as weak as I am for a good and steamy romance, it takes more than fantart and a few stolen glances to make me appreciate a difficult character, and if SJM managed to steal my heart with her Nesta, in the end, it means she did a great job that goes way beyond ships and smut.For the majority of the previous novels, Nesta is an unlikeable character, and for obvious reasons, the author doesn't want you to like her, so that it feels even more genuine when you start seeing there's good in her, and that she's perfectly nuanced, just like a real person.“There can be nothing more than sex, Cassian.”His jaw tightened, and he seemed to struggle with some internal battle before he said darkly, “Then I’ll take whatever you offer me.” He leaned in, his body still not touching hers, and said against her ear, “And I’ll take you however you wish me to.”Her toes curled on the stones, her hair dripping. “And if I wish to take you?”He smiled against her ear. “Then I’ll beg you to ride me into oblivion.”I want to discuss her character's journey in this review, because the book itself was good and the plot -the amount that was there, at least- was okay, but A Court of Silver Flames is a charcater-driven novel where the protagonist wasn't always a good person.For example, I've read at least a dozen reviews complaining about how this book makes you love Nesta and hate the rest of the original characters, or the opposite, and I can't say I don't see wher they come from, but I was lucky enough to fall in neither of these two categories since I've ended up loving Nesta and loving the other characters, as well, at the same time.They didn't always treat her with kindness, but I feel like they treated her in a very realistic way.When someone keeps pushing their luck, it's only a matter of time before people lose their patience.I loved how they each had a chance to connect and tangle their story with Nesta's, getting to know her, getting loved and understood by her, all of them finally getting a second chance at redemption and healing.One of the scenes I loved the most, is in fact, towards the end when Rhys kneels in front of Nesta after she's saved both Feyre and her baby's life. I lost it completely when they hugged.Nesta isn't an easy person to get along with. She's got a past that pretty much justifies her actions, but the way she choses to handle the consequences is all her own. And that's the point I feel like we need to remember. All her flaws are on display right from the start and there are moments when it even gets worse, but it's all part of her journey.It's only when you reach rock bottom that you can do anything but go up, right?“You could have ruled the world with your power,” he said carefully.“I don’t want to rule the world.” Her eyes were unguarded in a way he had never seen. Mate, she had called him.“What do you want?” Cassian managed to ask, voice rasping.She smiled, and damn if it wasn’t the loveliest thing he’d ever seen. “You.”“You’ve had me from the moment you met me.”She tucked a strand of hair behind an arched ear. “I know.”I loved how Nesta's relationship with Elain and Feyre was addressed. Elain could never do anything wrong in Nesta's eyes and the moment she (presumably) turned her back on her, Nesta was forcefully faced with a truth she wasn't ready to see, or better, that she didn't want to see.Same thing with Feyre. I felt like the sybolism of Feyre hanging paintings of everyone but Nesta in the new, opulent house she and her husband created, was for Nesta worse than any offense the inner circle ever thrown her way (and not without merit).One of the things Nesta resented most about about Feyre, in fact, is the fact that Nesta needed her to survive but Feyre didn't need her in return. Feyre was nothing but kind to her, all the time, but she hit her in the most subtle of ways, in a way that is more important to Feyre than words.Mind it, I don't mean what Nesta did and how she acted in the past is condonable, I'm just saying there's a reason behind her actions, reasons that will definitely help you (I don't say like, because you're allowed to still not like a character even if their past is justified) understand her a bit more.Nesta, as I see her, didn't like the hate and anger she felt all the time, especially towards her little sister. She, in fact, hated it and hated herself for feeling it.I've seen reviewers claim Nesta's friendship with Gwyn and Emerie made no sense, since she already had two sisters she could connect and make up with; I see their point, but I feel like Nesta was re-discovering herself and creating bonds tentatively presenting herself as the new person she was trying to become.Her relationship with the House, for example, was my absolute favorite. In my opinion, the fact that the House was stubborn, sweet, sarcastic in its own special way, warm and curious, added to the knowledge that Nesta Made it, makes me wonder (and hope) if that's exactly how Nesta sees her true self, if that's what she'd like others to see her.Rhys lifted his head. “This is a bad idea.”Cassian winked. “That should be written on the Night Court crest.”I loved seeing her through the eyes of someone who didn't fully know the darkest sides of her trauma and grief; I feel like it gave Nesta a glimps of what her life with her sisters could have been had her mother not gaslighted her into needing to be perfect at all costs, filling her head with conjectures and prejudices and depriving her from being free to decide what to do with her personality and future.And that's where Cassian finally jumps in. God bless that guy, honestly.I absolutely LOVED how he wasn't afraid to call her out on her bullshit but still knew (my god, he justknew) she needed some love despite it all, simple as that, and without asking anything in return.And sure, both Feyre and Elain loved Nesta, but I feel like the relationship the three sisters always had was always taunted by what they had to endure for and with one another.Feyre and Rhys will always own my heart, but Cassian and Nesta gave me the best emotions and I will never forget how beautiful they are together.And, holy shitNesta at the end, deciding she one day will want to have a baby with her Cassian completely destroyed me in the sweetest of ways. I don't consider motherhood as something essential, something you need to experience because it's mandatory to feel like a real woman. If a person feels complete and accomplished without ever having kids, I totally support it, but as a mother who has a problematic mother, I think it's one more proof of the fact that Nesta's journey is heading to a genuinely happy path.“I’ll be with you every step of the way,” he whispered into her palm. “Just don’t lock me out. You want to walk in silence for a week, I’m fine with that. So long as you talk to me at the end of it.”Plotwise speaking, there wasn't much going on, but I enjoyed it, nonetheless.One of the chapters I liked the most is when Nesta, Cassian and Azriel (instert Brooklyn99 BoyleMy fantasy threesome!gif) went to the Bog of Oorid looking for the Mask.I was fucking terrified by the whole Kelpie encounter.And the gift sharing moment was e v e r y t h i n g.I love Az with all my heart sigh.Also, I adored basically every scene with Gwyn and Emerie, especially when they were together.Maas's writing is exquisite as usual. I'll never stop being amazed by how vividly I can picture in my mind the scenes she describes.The only plotline I wish was handled a little better was the Rhys/Feyre andyou know whatone. Every choice Rhys made fromthatpoint, felt a bit uncharacteristical and not well thought enough.I decided to blame it on the emotion, because I refuse to think our Rhys would be anything but pragmatic when it comes to his Feyre's safety.Sorry if all of this makes little sense. This book and this character in particular made me really emotional in a way I'd never thought I'd feel toward a fantasy book carachter.Oh, and to lighten up the mood after this sob fest...this book also taught me something I've suspected for a while now, and that is, that everyone in acotar wants a piece of Azriel. Who am I to disagree.Nesta could hardly remember words. But she found them when she whispered into the darkness, “Stay with me.”A shudder rocked through him, but he only smiled as he tucked her into his side.And warm and safe and home at last in Cassian’s arms, Nesta slept.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '”Your power is a song, and one I’ve waited a very, very long time to hear, Nesta”.Aviso: la primera parte de esta reseña va a estar libre despoilersy les diré cuando empiecen a aparecer para que puedan dejar de leerla si no quieren saber qué pasa.No sé por qué me sigo sorprendiendo de que Sarah J. Maas lo logre una y otra vez. Es absolutamente impresionante lo que esta mujer puede llegar a transmitir con sus palabras. De verdad, leyendo ACOSF sentí que me destrozaban hasta lo más hondo y que luego, poco a poco, me iban reconstruyendo y poniendo cada pieza en su lugar.Como muchos aquí, debo confesar que no estaba tan emocionada por este libro porque se centraría en Nesta. Pero, así mismo, tengo que admitir que me comí todas y cada una de mis reservas y que, leyendo cada página, entendí profundamente a Nesta, sus traumas, su sufrimiento, su personalidad, la culpa que siente todo el tiempo y la sensación de que nunca eres lo suficientemente bueno para nadie. Y no sólo la entendí, sino que me sentí jodidamente identificada. Y, claro, luego me di cuenta de que odiaba tantísimo a Nesta porque reflejaba las partes más horribles de mí misma.ACOSF es un libro tremendamente intenso y lleno de emociones, de momentos de confrontar los sentimientos más oscuros, de arrepentimientos, rabia y odio. Pero también es una historia que lleva a Nesta en un camino que le permite enfrentar todos los demonios que tiene por dentro, todas las cosas que se ha guardado durante años, las decisiones que le quitaron de las manos y su odio hacia sí misma. Y, a pesar de lo oscuro que es el pozo en el que está y de lo duro que es el camino, Nesta se va a dar cuenta de que siempre va a existir alguien al otro lado de esa oscuridad para tenderle una mano, para caminar junto a ella y para recordarle una y otra vez que sí que se merece el amor de sus amigos y de su familia. Que nunca va a estar sola.En serio, no les puedo decir con palabras lo hondo que me llegó esta historia al corazón. Sí, es el libro máshotde Sarah J. Maas y todas esas escenas están diseñadas para ser leídas mientras estás en una tina llena de hielo porque… joder. Y obviamente las marqué todas y casi me da un infarto leyendo otras. Y también mucha envidia. Pero más allá de eso, creo que eran una forma súper poderosa de comunicar lo mucho que Nesta necesitaba una distracción, salirse de sus pensamientos durante unos momentos… u horas (because Fae lovers, jajaja) porque estar dentro de su cabeza era demasiado doloroso. Y la entiendo.Y Cassian… ay, ¿cómo puede existir alguien tan bueno, valiente, sensible y paciente? Si amaron a Cassian en los libros anteriores, en este van a querer abrazarlo (y más cosas, ejem) hasta que todo esté bien para él. No se pueden imaginar todo lo que conocemos sobre Cassian en ACOSF, sobre su pasado, sus sentimientos, sus miedos y, sobre todo, cómo es tan genuino como para siempre demostrar lo mucho que le importan quienes son cercanos para él, todo lo que estaría dispuesto a hacer y soportar por ellos. En este libro, Cassian enfrenta toda la tormenta de proporciones épicas que significa estar cerca de Nesta, pero lo hace porque sabe que ella está en un lugar oscuro, que está luchando por salir de allí y él la entiende… porque ha estado él mismo en ese camino antes. Joder, es que, de verdad… después de leer este tipo de cosas, ves a las personas del mundo real y te das cuenta de que eso no existe. Ojalá todos pudiéramos tener la certeza de que, cuando salgamos de nuestros momentos más oscuros, siempre va a estar alguien allí esperándonos para decirnos que todo va a estar bien o incluso sólo para sonreírnos o abrazarnos.Ahora, obviamente todo el libro no se centra únicamente en Nesta y Cassian, sino que Sarah J. Maas nos presenta una nueva amenaza que puede, nuevamente, destruir todas las Cortes e incluso afectar al mundo de los humanos. Pero esta es una amenaza mucho más antigua, poderosa y letal de lo que el Rey de Hybern pudo llegar a ser. Más adelante hablaré de ello, pero me gustó que hubiera una historia paralela de conflicto, de magia arcana y de monstruos que no pueden volver a caminar libremente por el mundo.Antes de empezar con la sección despoilers, tengo que decirles que amé profundamente volver a ver a los personajes que adoro. Feyre, Rhysand, Mor, Amren y Azriel no son solamente sombras en el fondo de las escenas de ACOSF, sino que siguen siendo importantes y están allí para los momentos más críticos. Ahora, que ellos sean ligeramente menos importantes en este libro que Cassian y Nesta no quiere decir que Sarah J. Maas no los vaya a usar para rompernos el corazón, triturar los pedacitos, sumergirlos en ácido y luego incinerarlos. De verdad, es tremendo… Y lo único que diré, y que discutiré más a fondo más adelante, es que les juro que no pude parar de llorar con el último 10% del libro. Y no precisamente de felicidad.Vamos con losspoilersy con Isa perdiendo la cabeza… de nuevo.•••1. Sí, vamos a hablar de la dedicatoria del libro. Cuando la leí al principio dije como “oh, vaya, bueno”, pero ahora que la estoy releyendo y estoy escribiendo esta reseña, puedo decirles que casi lloro. Dice”For every Nesta out there, climb the mountain”.2. Las pesadillas que tiene Nesta nos dan una pista de todo lo que está batallando por dentro desde que la sumergieron en elCauldrony, joder, poco a poco entendemos por qué es como es. Nadie que lidie con pesadillas que describe como el frío antes de las estrellas, el vacío antes del infierno, puede siquiera fingir estar bien.3. ¿Cómo me atreví a juzgar a Nesta sin saber que ella sentía la inmortalidad como un fuego eterno y no como una serena juventud? Son estas pequeñas frases las que nos dan, incluso en las primeras páginas, las pistas que necesitamos para ver lo destrozada que está, que toda su mala actitud es una coraza para protegerse.4. Me rompe el corazón ver a Cassian al principio del libro admitiendo que el fuego helado de los ojos de Nesta siempre había sido una tentación para él. Y es que justo lo piensa cuando está en su apartamento destartalado en donde ella se ha estadofuckinga cuantos machos Fae quisiera y bebiendo hasta perder el conocimiento… Y lo peor es que Nesta tiene a un macho en su cuarto en ese momento. Agh.5. Y luego ella admite para sí misma que todo ese sexo con desconocidos, el alcohol y la música la ayuda a apagar un poco ese fuego frío y oscuro que la consume desde que la forzaron a entrar alCauldron. Nesta siempre ha estado muy rota y siento que la hemos juzgado demasiado sin saber exactamente lo mal que lo estaba pasando dentro de su cabeza.6. Lo triste es que hay una cita que dice que ese sexo no la hacía sentir nada más allá de un momento fugaz de liberación de ese poder cataclísmico que hay dentro de ella. Pero luego se ríe un poco y dice que incluso los siglos de experiencia que algunos machos Fae tienen no los hacen buenos en la cama, jajaja.7. EL HORROR del momento en el que Cassian vuelve a ese apartamento y le dice que se nota que ni siquiera se ha dignado a cambiar las sábanas entre sus visitantes PORQUE PUEDE OLERLOS. Dioses, en serio Nesta está en un punto muy bajo en ese momento.8. Es tremendo cuando Feyre y los demás le dan un ultimátum a Nesta: o accede a entrenar con Cassian por las mañanas y a ayudar a las acólitas de la biblioteca por las tardes e intenta enderezar su vida o la van a enviar de vuelta al mundo humano. Esa pelea y esa conversación son durísimas, pero tenían que darle un empujón para que empezara a salir de ese pozo.9. AMO A RHYSAND. Hay un momento en el que está hablando con Cassian después de la “intervention” de Nesta. Y Cass le dice que tiene que volver a entrenar porque no querría que Feyre, sumate, encontrara partes blandas en su cuerpo. Y RHYS RESPONDE QUE ELLA NUNCA ENCUENTRA NADA BLANDO Y OMG, JAJAJA. Y luego hablan de que Rhys les dio el día libre a los sirvientes y Cassian cree que es para que no los escuchen pelear después de lo de Nesta, pero Rhys le dice que no son las peleas lo que no quiere que escuchen, AIUDA.10. Se me rompió MAL el corazón cuando Cassian vio el retrato de Feyre y Rhys juntos, sus anillos y a ellos mismos y lo invadió ese sentimiento de querer lo que ellos tienen, a alguien especial a su lado. POBRECILLO MÍO.11. Ay, dioses, y más adelante Cassian dice que tiene que alejarse mucho de la casa del río porque no quiere ni oírlo ni sentir su poder cuando Rhys… acabe. PERO ES QUE ESO NO ES TODO. Luego menciona como quien no quiere la cosa que, cuando eran más jóvenes, Az, Rhys y Cassian se f*llaban a muchísimas hembras Y GENERALMENTE EN LA MISMA HABITACIÓN. ¿ES QUE NADIE VA A HABLAR DE ESTO? O sea… dioses. A mí nadie me puede quitar de la cabeza que esos tres…you know. QUIERO UNFANFICDE ESTO YA MISMO.12. AMO cada vez que Cassian molesta a Nesta recordándole lo mucho que le gusta leer novelas eróticas, jajaja.13. Uf, también me rompe el corazón los momentos en los que Nesta admite para sí misma que sabe lo desagradable que es con los demás, lo dura que es la coraza que la rodea y lo asustada que está ella misma de ese pozo infinito de poder oscuro que tiene dentro de ella. Y hay una cita en la que dice que siempre se sintió cómoda siendo como un lobo, como un depredador, pero que cuando llegó el momento de eliminar a ese ser feroz, se dio cuenta de que la había devorado incluso a ella.14. Ehhh… ¿podemos hablar de que Rhys sigue siendo un loquillo? Es que le habla por el vínculo mental a Cassian en medio de dos… eh…roundscon Feyre,if you know what I mean.15. A ver, todos sabemos que, tarde o temprano, Cassian y Nesta van a hacerlo sobre todas las superficies de la Casa, pero es que toda la tensión previa es la que me matabaaaaaa. ¡La tensión y las frases con doble sentido y los gruñidos bajos! En el primer día de entrenamiento, Cassian le dice a Nesta, con voz súper grave, que le alegra que se haya levantado lista para jugar. Y ELLA SE DERRITE AUNQUE NUNCA LO ACEPTARÁ EN VOZ ALTA… todavía.16. PERO LO QUE SÍ RECUERDA ES ESE MOMENTO EN LA BATALLA FINAL, ahhhh. O sea, cuando pensaron que iban a morir y él la besó y le dijo que desearía haber tenido más tiempo, pero que la encontrará en esta vida y las siguientes. Es que me muero. Y Nesta admite mentalmente que nunca deja de pensar en ese momento. Ayyyyyy, ya bésenseeeee.17. Sarah J. Maas me quiere matar porque luego Nesta dice que si Cassian cree que todo esto de entrenar va a terminar con ella subiéndose a su cama, que está muy equivocado. Y él dice que eso está clarísimo, que él no se va a subir a la cama de ella, PORQUE ES ELLA QUIEN VA A SUPLICAR ESTAR EN LA CAMA DE CASSIAN. AYUDA, NECESITO AGUA FRÍA.18. Y no soy la única que necesita hielo porque cuando Cassian ve a Nesta en losIllyrian leathersde entrenar, que son pantalones y equipo muy ajustado, el pobre casi muere y empieza a fantasear sobre todo lo que haría quitándole esos pantalones y… uf.19. Y justo después de esas fantasías Cassian recuerda que no ha tenido más compañía que su mano desde hace más de dos años, cuando lo hizo duro y rápido contra una pared de ladrillo con una hembra cualquiera que encontró en un bar. O SEA, CASSIAN ESTÁHORNYY LA QUE NOS ESPERA EN ESTE LIBRO… MADRE DE TODOS LOS DIOSES.20. Esos primeros días de entrenamiento cuando Cassian lleva a Nesta a Windhaven y ella se niega a levantarse de una roca y entrenar son tremendos. Y es obvio que todos losillyrianse están burlando de Cassian por dejar que una mujer tan terca le gane… y aunque Nesta sabe que lo está haciendo ver débil y lo odia, no puede ceder porque siente que es mejor que la odie a que se acerque. MI CORAZÓN.21. Parte de la razón por la que este libro me enseñó a no odiar a Nesta es que entendemos mucho más cómo piensa. Y me identifiqué un montón, de verdad. Verla a ella era verme a mí en los momentos más horrorosos de salud mental. Cuando ella dice que odia todo lo que es, que está absolutamente exhausta y que está cansada de querer estar en un lugar que no sea su cabeza… wow.I felt that.22. Me encantó la conversación que tienen Amren y Cassian en la que ella le dice que deje que Nesta cave su propia tumba, pero que al final le ofrezca su mano. Que no se rinda y siga ofreciéndole su ayuda para salir de ese lugar oscuro.23. FAAAAAAAN de que Lucien diga que Tamlin está sufriendo y que desde el final de la guerra no ha adoptado su forma Fae, sino que está vagando por su corte como la bestia que es.Fucker.24. Sabes que se vienen problemas cuando empiezas a enterarte de que las criaturas poderosísimas que inclinaron la balanza en favor de la Corte de la Noche tienen hermanos. En este caso, nos presentan a Koschei, el hermano delBone Carver. Y que parece que está aliado con Briallyn, una de las reinas que entró alCauldrony que ahora quiere recuperar laDread Trove, una colección de objetos poderosísimos, hechos por elCauldronmismo, que tiene el poder de empezar otra guerra y borrarlos a todos del mapa.Oh, joy.25. Hay una mañana en la que Nesta casi no puede moverse porque la noche anterior intentó bajar las 10.000 escaleras que separan a la Casa de Velaris. Y Cassian se da cuenta en el desayuno y la molesta con que no se puede ni parar. Y ella lo hace apoyándose un montón en sus manos, pero él le dice que no cuenta si son las manos las que están haciendo todo el trabajo. Y ELLA LE DICE QUE SON SUS MANOS LAS QUE DEBEN ESTAR OCUPADAS TODAS LAS NOCHES, OMG. Entonces Cassian le responde con voz grave que si es eso lo que le enseñan sus libros eróticos, que sólo se hace por la noche. Él nota Y HUELE lohotque se pone ella y sigue diciendo que se puede hacer en cualquier momento, con la luz del día, durante un baño o incluso después de una LARGA Y DURA sesión de entrenamiento. En serio, lean este libro con hielo a la mano.26. ¡Lo peor es que toda esa conversación sucede mientras Az también está en la mesa con ellos! Y al final, cuando Nesta se va, Azriel le dice a Cassian que lo va a tener muy jodido, pero él ya no lo está ni escuchando porque en su cabeza se está imaginando todo lo que las manos de Nesta podrían hacer con él y JODER, LES DIJE QUE ESTE LIBRO ES DEMASIADO CALIENTE. Y ESO QUE NO HA SUCEDIDO NADA.27. Uf, golpe bajo cuando, en medio de una pelea porque Nesta sigue negándose a entrenar en Windhaven, Cassian también explota y ella le responde diciéndole que genial, que menos mal ya no lo va a tener babeando detrás de ella y que le costó mucho entender las señales de que ella no lo quería. Y MALDITA SEA, OBVIAMENTE LO QUIERES. Y ÉL A TI. Pero también entiendo la reacción de querer alejar a todo el mundo cuando ni tú te soportas a ti misma.***SIGUE EN COMENTARIOS***'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""3.5 stars.here comes the post-series hangover.it's safe to say that this series has my entire heart.nesta’s redemption arc is 751 pages of smutty illyrian desperation (maybe slightly too smutty?!) and self discovery. i now like nestabecausei’ve also disliked her. the ugliest parts of nesta are things that i recognize in myself and that’s the beauty of this book.✨a court of smut and self-help.✨and, of course, men with wings are just superior in every way.🤍 i need azriel to get his own booknow(though preferably not with elain lol)(acowar & acomaf remain my favorites from this series, but i can’t wait to see what sjm has in store for books 5 and 6.)""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '[2022] edit:changed my mind this is more of a 4 star than a 5🙃_________________I\'m sobbing that was so beautifulAll hailQueen Nestaand SJM for making melove her so muchI don\'t know what to do with myself now.Like actually, I think I\'m gonna be in a book hangover forweeks— no,monthsomg I cannot.

But you keep going.Because you know the destination will be worthwhile.""This isNesta\'s special journey. Nesta\'s journey through dealing with her trauma. Struggling with the pain she\'s been in and healing.Finding the ability to love herself.I didn\'t think SJM could write a better book for mental health than ACOMAF, but I believe right here, she didexactlythat. There wasn\'t a single scene where I didn\'t feel likemy heart was breaking.This was such an emotional ride. I could actually relate to Nesta and while it isn\'t as severe as her, there are times where I\'d also hate myself and feel like I deserve nothing. And seeing Nesta deal with all of this --it broke me in so many ways. To have her in so much pain and think that she herself has to change in order to be ""fixed""... ohmygod no I swear I cant.😭🤚Then there was Cassian. I love how he wouldn\'t give up on Nesta and even while trying to help her, he still didn\'t let her get away with everything.He kept reaching out his handthroughout it all. But in the end, the only person who could heal Nesta wasNesta herself.You can help someone as much as you want, but at the end of all that, it\'s up to them tosee past that darkness and find the light. Tolove themselvesandbe happywith who they are.To heal the parts of you that hurt so much and hurt others.im crying again dammitThis book hit me so hard. I\'m actually such a mess. I never thought I could love a book this much. Not surprised it was Queen SJM that did this to me.I willneverforget the impact Nesta\'s story had on me.

She was the master of herself.I know I talked about Nesta already but seriously she\'s such a queen. Cassian wasn\'t the only one there for her. We\'re introduced to new characters in this book andI love it. Honestly, it had to be my favourite part of her story.Nesta\'s friendship with Emerie and Gwyn was so, so,so wholesome and sweet.Each of them had their own past that haunted them and were afraid for the other to find out.But that\'s exactly what made them fit so well together.That moment where they all shared their secrets with each other, realizing that the other wouldn\'t be judging them...I cried so muchnot surprisingomg it was so beautiful to see them open up.Their love for each other was tested especially when they had to participate in The Blood Rite. I was so shook, I actually didn\'t think they\'d be doing it, but ohmygodthat was so stressful. I was terrified SJM would destroy me again and kill Emerie or Gwyn.Thank god she took pity on our poor hearts.Also, omg them training to be Valkyries dsfdsfgd YES YESYES. I LOVED that so much. And to see them in action during The Blood Rite against those bastards???Perfection.but also really stressful bc my gurls🥺ALSO THE FRIENDSHIP BRACELETS OHMYGOD I CANNOT.HEARTBREAKING AND BEAUTIFUL.I legit hope Gwyn and Emerie play bigger roles in the next two books, especially *ahem* because I have some ships in mind.😏 Yes, I may be too early but I believe in EmeriexMor and AzrielxGwyn🙏═══*.·:·.☽✧ ✦ ✧☾.·:·.*═══""The first time I saw that look on your face, you were still human. Still human, and I nearly went to my knees before you.""Tell me, what\'s one of the most heartbreaking scenes you\'ve ever read?I\'ll tell you mine --CHAPTER 50. That was so heart-wrenching, my heart died. My own sisters were looking at me like I was insane. But something even more heartbreaking?CASSIANCRYINGThat completely and utterly destroyed me. I was dying on the inside. Just thinking about him crying, is making me cry. I swear to god, I literally putmy heart through torture reading this.Seeing through Cassian\'s POV is the greatest gift we could\'ve asked for. All the flaws and insecurities he feels, I\'m in so muchp a i n. I adore himeven morethan before. He was there for Nesta and Nesta was there for him, my heart-""Forgiveness is not that easy.""""Forgiveness is something we also grant ourselves.

I don\'t want you to ever lose things, to cage yourself.""STOP. THE. PAIN. *cries* Cas, when did you become so wise and give such heart crushing speeches?? This is one of the most beautiful lines I\'ve ever read. No question about it.Also, to finally find out what was in the solstice gift Cassian wanted to give Nesta -- it wasA BOOK.Okay imma stop right there, I\'m crying again.

Absolutely amazing and kind. I didn\'t I could lovea houseso much, but here I am.Nesta wished for a friend and the House became that friend for her. It encouraged her to do more, pushed her to try more. The Housereads romance novels. I\'m crying, I love the House so much. And the darkness that swirled at the bottom of the library?? I can\'t believe that was theheartof the House ohmygod please I love it. The way Nesta accepted the way it was, just like the House did that for her...sdfgdsfs I\'m in pain. *sobs* too much for my heart.AND IT GAVE NESTA CHOCOLATE CAKE AND ROMANCE BOOKS.What\'s not to love about the House???woah wait, why is this reminding me of celaena with her love of chocolate cake and books *shook*The House of Wind ise v e r y t h i n g.═══*.·:·.☽✧ �� ✧☾.·:·.*═══""I went into the Cauldron, too, you know. And it capturedme.And yet somehow all you think of is whatmytrauma did toyou.""(This is Nesta\'s book, but I justhaveto say this.)I\'m guilty of this too, but I think most of us hated Elain because of how we saw her, being sweet, kind and useless...and judged her right away,forgetting that she also is stillsufferinggoing into the Cauldron and with what happened in the war against Hybern.Just like Nesta, Elain has a different way of showing her trauma and that\'s byhiding it awayand making it look like she\'s okay, using the image everyone thinks of her being--sweet and kind. It\'s just like we all think of her and hate her for that. Everyone expects Elain to be one thing, so she acts like that BUTis that truly Elain?So yeah, I judged her too early. (Feysand\'s POV really helped with this too) I shouldn\'t hate her right away because there\'s still her story to be told. I\'m actually excited to see that.But even knowing all of this, I still don\'t like Elain.🤷\u200d♀️ I understand it and everything but just something about her rubs me off the wrong way. I don\'t hate her, but I don\'t like her either. I have no doubt Sarah will make us love, or at the very least, like Elain next book.Also, I seriously do not ship her with Azriel.I believeAzriel and Gwynwould be such a beautiful pair ohmygod I\'d love that so much. If the three brothers get with the three archeron sisters...no no no,pleaseno. And I absolutely love the Azriel POV. My heart is hurting so much for Azzy🥺 He needs the love he deserves.Omg every time he\'d appear as the""chaperone""for Nesta and Cassian--omg I was dying of laughter. I loved those scenes. Poor Azzy having to deal with Nesta and Cas, tsk tsk naughty Fae. But the friendship between Nesta and Azzy ohmygod my heart, im crying it was so beautiful. Azzy have NestaAlso, something else as to why I think AzrielxElain wont be endgame is because during the solstice dance, both Cas and Eris talk about how smothered/plain Elain is wearing black, which I feel like is SJM\'s way of saying thatElain isn\'t compatible with The Night Court and it\'s darkness & shadows.ahhh I truly feel like she\'s going to go to another court in the next book.Also Azzy\'s shadowsdisappearwhen they\'re around Elain. Meanwhile, the shadowsdontdisappear around Gwyn...they come alive around her. I don\'t know about you, but it looks like SJM is trying to say something👀I stan Gwynriel“I am the rock against which the surf crashes.""“Nothing can break me.”AND THE FACT THAT AZZY SINGS AND GWYN SINGS SDFGSDFD I CANT😭🤚═══*.·:·.☽✧ ✦ ✧☾.·:·.*═══""I\'ll deny it to the grave if you tell anyone, but I missed you too, Cursebreaker.""Helion is amazing sdfgdsfsdf I love him so much. I think we can all agree withneedingmore Helion these next few books. And for Lucien to find out the truth🥺 We need a Lucien book so bad omg so many books needed.I\'m so curious as to what really was going on when Nesta asked about Jurian & Vassa and Lucien replied sharply HMM I may be reading too much into that, but something\'s going on ughhh I wanna know more about those three.ALSO,ERIS. There is SO MUCH MORE to Eris then is shown. I really want to see more Eris and his story. I believe there\'s a lot more to him and Cas even sees that he\'s a decent guy.Oh, another thing I forgot to mention was the fact thatNesta Made three magic weaponsand one of them she named the swordAtaraxia, which meansInner Peace...I\'m in love. I stan Nesta so much. She grew to be so much stronger than she was before annnnnd the tears are coming in again.😃✌This reminds me of Feyre and Nesta\'s relationship. *sobs* It brings me joy to see thetwo finally understand and show their love for each other. No matter what, Feyre wouldn\'t give up on her either. She tried so hard to help Nesta and I love Feyre so much for that. Unlike *cough* some people *cough* Rhysand. I actually despise him SO MUCH, it was so messed up. The way I hate this guy with every fibre of my being😃Although, I have to say that when Nesta apologized to everyone it irked me. Like yeah, she did say harmful things to them, but the Inner Circle did too?? Honestly, they should\'ve apologized too, mainly Rhys and Amren but ah, that didn\'t happen *rage* they should grovel at her feet.OMG WAIT. JUST ONE MORE THING I REALIZED.THIS:THAT WASAELIN.

Then, on Harry's eleventh birthday, a great beetle-eyed giant of a man called Rubeus Hagrid bursts in with some astonishing news: Harry Potter is a wizard, and he has a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. An incredible adventure is about to begin!","[{'rating': 4, 'content': '(A-) 83%| Very GoodNotes:An effortless enchantment, it\'s lush with warmth and lore: seeded well, it casts a spell, and leaves you wanting more.*Check out progress updates for detailed commentary:Progress updates:01/11/2020- Preamble(1) After nearly 9 months, I finally finished all five ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" audiobooks, I was going to run a poll on what I should listen to next but, c\'mon, let\'s be real.(2) I decided on the Stephen Fry version over Jim Dale simply because I can\'t abide by ""Sorcerer\'s Stone."" It\'s ""Philosopher\'s Stone"" for me or no stones at all!01/12/2020- 9%(1) ""People in cloaks! Mr. Dursley couldn\'t bear people who dressed in funny clothes – the getups you saw on young people!""- With the movies, it\'s easy to forget that everyday wizard attire involves brightly colored cloaks and pointy hats.(2) McGonagall: ""There will be books written about Harry – every child in our world will know his name!""01/13/2020- 16%(1) Harry gets Dudley\'s second room, which seems very much like the Room of Requirement. It\'s used to hide Dudley\'s disused and broken things, but now functions as a bedroom.(2) If this snake was bred in captivity, and doesn\'t often speak to humans, how does it speak Portuguese? I suppose there\'s some Parseltongue iteration of Portuguese.01/14/2020- 23%(1) Hagrid: ""\'The gold ones are Galleons,\' he explained. \'Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle.\'""- It\'s interesting that despite UK decimalization, wizards still use a kind of £sd currency. They\'re sort of American that way: resisting metric.(2) A knut is a wizard penny, I presume after King Cnut the Great.01/15/2020- 34%(1) Harry: ""What are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?""Hagrid: ""School houses. There\'s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o\' duffers, but–""Harry: ""I bet I\'m in Hufflepuff,"" said Harry gloomily.""- Hufflepuff does sound like it\'s for stoners.(2) Ron\'s both shocked and impressed that Harry said ""Voldemort."" Sort of like cursing, uttering his name.01/16/2020- 43%(1) ""Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head. \'GRYFFINDOR!\' shouted the hat. Ron groaned.""- And thus begins our enemies-to-lovers romance.(2) ""Ickle"" must be Britishism of Britishisms. I\'ve only ever seen it in ""Harry Potter"" books.(3) Hope my GIFs are well-received. Let me know if they ever get annoying.01/17/2020- 55%(1) ""The students all hated [Filch], and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.""- Well, as long as they don\'t actually kick the cat.(2) Re: Football: ""Ron couldn\'t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly.""- I dislike soccer for separate, non-magical, reasons.01/18/2020- 62%(1) Ron saves Hermione from the troll. When it comes to Hermione, Harry\'s invariably placid, it\'s always fireworks with Ron.(2) Before I knew better, I used to think ""Hermione"" was pronounced ""hermy-won.""(3) ""Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence. \'Weird!\' he said, \'What a shape! This is money?\'""- I guess heptagons aren\'t common among wizards.01/19/2020- 69%(1) The problem with the library\'s ""restricted section"" is that anyone can go there. Just keep them locked in a separate room, there must be hundreds of those available.(2) Remembralls are about as useful as tying string around your finger.(3) Harry: ""How did you know – ?""Dumbledore: ""I don\'t need a cloak to become invisible.""- Totally pwned!01/20/2020- 73%(1) “Ron and Hermione [were] playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.”- I agree, it keeps her humble and open to suggestions.- It’s good for Ron too, having something he’s best at.(2) I love how openly biased teachers are toward their houses. It makes them more human.01/21/2020- 77%(1) Ron and Neville fist fight Malfoy, Crabbe & Goyle. If you ask me, Malfoy\'s Ron\'s nemesis not Harry\'s.(2) ""Hermione... had started drawing up study schedules and color coding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldn\'t have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same.""- Pressuring idiosyncrasies is weird... like making friends dress like you.01/22/2020- 84%(1) Filch: ""Hang you by your wrists... I\'ve got the chains still in my office, keep \'em well oiled in case they\'re ever needed.""- Not an awful idea, motives aside. Manacles can be handy.(2) ""Snape made them all nervous... while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.""- Trick question! Potion fumes might cause them to forget!01/23/2020- 90%(1) The difference between J.K. Rowling and Rick Riordan is that Rowling plays the long game, building scenes toward the climax. Whereas Riordan plays in short bursts, ping-ponging from one mini-quest to another. Here, for example, Ron being best at chess, Hagrid giving Harry a flute, Peeves being scared of the Bloody Baron, etc., all pay-off at the climax.01/24/2020- 90%(1) Dumbledore: ""Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.""- Wonder why Dumbledore doesn\'t give this advice to everyone? Surely people would listen.(2) Lost in the narrative is that Harry kills a guy. Literally kills him with the power of love... it\'s a curious thing.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Publishers have my sympathy. If I try to put myself in the place of an editor picking this manuscript from the pile I can say with some certainty that I would not have recognized it as the ticket to a multi-billion dollar prize. I would have thought to myself that it was a good fun read, revisiting the magic-school trope and doing a fine job for children in the 8 to 12 range. If I hadn\'t had anything better land on my desk I might have published it, but then again, like quite a number of publishers, I might have passed in favour of a book I liked better.I read this maybe 15 years back so I could share in what was exciting my three kids at the time. And I\'ve read it twice to my daughter, Celyn. We read the first 5 some years back, and now she\'s 12 we\'re going to read the whole lot. She\'s very disabled and can\'t read for herself (she can\'t hold the book or see the page for starters...)Having just finished I\'ve checked the shelves to discover we have two copies of book 1 and two copies of book 3, but none of book 2. So JKR will be getting some more of my money shortly!To the review... I liked the book. I have no idea why it has sold a gazzilion copies more than any other children\'s book or why so many adults are so taken with it. JKR writes solid enough prose, though her addiction to adverbs in dialogue tags irks me no end, he said testily. She writes a fun and inventive story, though the internal inconsistencies would have distressed me even as a child. Why do the finest wizards in the land leave a great treasure guarded only by a series of puzzles rather than actual defences? If in the final scenes the puzzle poem hadn\'t been left to give the solution to the potion test ... or the key hadn\'t been left in the same room as the door that wouldn\'t yield to magic ... would that not have been a better way to defend the treasure? Yes ... it was more fun this way, but ... dammit ... kids aren\'t stupid...But yes, funny and inventive magic, school dynamics of making friends and enemies, the hijinx, the evil baddie, the chosen one... it\'s all good. Celyn certainly enjoyed it. She\'s on team Hermionie.The only other thing that really bothered me was the repeated insinuation, present even in the term itself, that \'muggles\' are somehow lesser. That the random gift of magical ability somehow makes you better.I remember that later on (and hinted at in this book) the idea of mud-bloods (wizards born of muggles) is offered up as a proxy for racism and we\'re invited to condemn Draco Malfoy for his views (rightly so). But all the time I read this I\'m feeling the hypocrisy embodied in the whole idea of muggles, which, albeit voiced without open malice, is really the same damn thing.I will report back on book 2 when we\'re done.EDITED IN FROM THE COMMENTS:>>Aliyah wrote: ""Personally I believe the trope is so familiar to you because of JK Rowling. She made this style of fantasy more popular."">My reply: Personal beliefs are fine and dandy, but in this instance ... badly wrong.My first encounter with magic schools was in The Worst Witch series (1974) which centres on a magic school and which I began in 1974.

Hoggy Hoggy warty warts.I think at this point, everyone and their great-great-grandmother has heard of this book.Harry Potter, orphaned before he was one, was sent to live with his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon. He was always a bit ofan odd child- much to his family's dismay.Things just...happened...around him. Like when he was running from bullies and jumped to the school roof. Or when he got an atrocious haircut (courtesy of Aunt Petunia) and all of his hair grew back in a single night.On his eleventh birthday, a letter comes to him anda whole new world opensin front of his eyes.In short - I LOVED THIS ONE. I thought I loved the Harry Potter books when I first read them, but when I bought the illustrated version...well, that love instantly quadrupled.The fully illustrated Philosopher's Stone still has all the wonder and amazement as the boy-turned-wizard embarks on a harrowing 7-book-adventure and the illustrations bring a whole new dimension.Seriously, I can't emphasize enough how much I love this book.Just look at these images - they're magnificent:Ahh! Just look at sad, tiny Harry. Don't worry kid - life will get better!Not only are thesefull-color, high quality imagesbut there are somanyof them.Often, illustrated books have a picture here or there but not HP. There'spages and pages of pictureslike this - and often the pages without full-sized images will have a small illustrations here and there between the large ones.Words cannot express how highly I recommend this one.

They are now old enough to start appreciating the story so I thought it would be fun to read it out loud to them. While it did take us a while because, you know . . . life happens . . . we were able to find a few minutes every few nights or so to read a chapter or part of a chapter. It was really fun to see them getting into it.They are looking forward to watching the movie and starting in on the Chamber of Secrets!Original review:One of my first jobs was at a bookstore. When I was a kid my Mom would take me to the mall and I would spend tons of time hanging out at Waldenbooks (who here remembers Waldenbooks?) Right when I became legally old enough to work, I went in and submitted my application and a few weeks later I was selling literature to the masses.Why do I tell you this story on this review, you ask? Well, at the time, young adult/teen literature consisted mainly of RL Stein, Christopher Pike, Beverly Cleary, Judy Blume, and a few other classic Newberry Award winners, but certainly we did not have a YA section to the extent you see it today.Towards the end of my tenure at Waldenbooks - as Oprah's book club was hitting its stride and Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus was in its bazzilionth week on the New York Times best seller list - a book display arrived featuring a buzzy new title about a certain boy wizard. I remember the display at the front of the store, and selling a few copies, but I didn't realize what it would become.A few years later (early 2000s), I had kinda gotten out of the loop on what was big in books. I had just finished college, which had taken up most of my free reading time. A friend of mine named Bronco (yup, real name, not a nickname, who also was the Best Man at my wedding) had a copy of this book on his coffee table. Holy cow! Here is that same book we were selling at Waldenbooks about 5 years before - what was he doing with it!?Well, he said it was good, so I borrowed it. I quickly plowed through the first 4 books and then got the pleasure of joining the world in waiting for the release of Order of the Phoenix. And, I noticed when I went to the bookstore, the YA section and selection was not so small anymore. I truly believe it was Harry Potter that opened the door to get more young adults (and even adults, of course) reading and authors interested in writing for that genre.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I\'m going to keep this brief since there isn\'t much to say that hasn\'t already been said. *clears throat*I think the reason I waited so long to read this series is because I just couldn\'t imagine myself enjoying reading about an eleven-year-old boy and his adventures at a school of wizardry. I thought it would be too juvenile for my taste. I was wrong, of course.I can honestly say that I loved every minute of this. It\'s a spectacular little romp with funny, courageous, and endearing characters that you can\'t help but love.It has talking chess pieces, singing hats, a giant three-headed dog named Fluffy, a hilarious giant with a dragon fetish, a master wizard that\'s just a little bit crazy, mail carrier owls, goblins running a bank, unicorns, centaurs(!), trolls . . . and probably much more that I\'m forgetting.And then there\'s the lead characters: Hermione, the young scholar who starts out prim and up-tight but soon becomes a true friend; Ron, the boy who has little money but who has an abundance of family and loyalty to his friends to make up for it; and then there\'s Harry, the boy who starts out sleeping in a closet and ends up being a hero. Harry is kind to those that deserve it, fearless when it counts the most, and wonderfully intelligent. What\'s not to love?In regards to the ending:I feel silly saying this about a middle grade novel, but I didn\'t suspect Quirrell a bit! If there were hints that he was the true culprit and not Snape, I obviously missed them.FAVORITE QUOTE:""But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can\'t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.""Now, if you\'ll excuse me, I\'m off to startHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.*******************************************************My reviews of other titles in this series:Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'My original review was a comparison of sorts between Harry Potter and Twilight. However, this is stupid as the two are incomparable. Honestly, its not even worth discussing. Its not just that Twilight doesn\'t come close, it is the fact that Harry Potter transcends other similar works. Its peerless. To quote Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction: It""ain\'t the same fuckin\' ballpark, it ain\'t the same league, it ain\'t even the same fuckin\' sport.""There was a day when I thought I needed to defend Harry Potter, in the midst of the now dead Twilight craze, and you can see that below in what was my original review. It is a testament to the power of this series, that while various other franchises (Twilight, Hunger Games) have surged into popularity and then faded, Harry Potter remains unwaveringly strong after nineteen years. It is clear readers hold just as much admiration for these books as they always have. Time has not dimmed that.I will, one day, write an essay about what these books mean to me. Eternal, this is the one that started it all.Original review (circa 2010)A note in regard to the on-going Potter vs Twilight debate:Go ahed, tell meTwilightis better.Tell me that James is scarier than Voldemort,That the Cullens are a better family than the Weasly\'sThat Edward is cooler than Harry,and Bella is smarter than Hermione.Tell me thatStephenie Meyeris more talented thanJ.K.

She wasn\'t an outcast in school, and all the bullying and teasing stopped with the commencement of high school, but she had always been a bookworm and has generally preferred the company of her own thoughts.Lunchtime had always been dedicated not to eating, but to sitting in the library, browsing through books.(Not to worry, she got her nutrition in 5th period in the form of a giant 6-inch M&M studded cookie and a package of Sour Patch Kids and/or a package of Reese\'s Pieces. Ah, the effortless metabolism of youth.)One day, there were shiny new books on her school library\'s ""New Releases"" shelf. Harry Potter, books 1 through 3. She had heard of the books before, of course, since they were a constant presence on the NYT bestsellers list, but she had always avoided them, thinking of them as children\'s novels.At the grand age of 14, surely she was too old for a little kid\'s fantasy novel. She had read theOutlanderseries earlier that year, after all. And it had sex in it. SEX! She didn\'t really quite understand everything in the book, but the point is, she had read them. Surely, at 14, Khanh was ready for more mature novels.And that did not include Harry Potter.Harry Potter is 11. Khanh is 14.There is a vast difference in their ages. Khanh was ateenager, dammit.But the Harry Potter books were new. Brand new. They were shiny, they had never been touched by another reader.

Initially, when I read it, I devoured it in two days. Now that I am old, well as old as Megan Fox, I wanted to hate on the author but couldn\'t.JK Rowling makes writing look easy. Her prose is easy to read out loud, very smooth. Although the world that she has created is magical, it isn\'t confusing or that difficult to imagine unlike LOTR or Dune. The book is also incredibly fast paced. Many of the fantasy books that I have read have at least 100 pages to warm up. So how does the author make us want to root or cheer for Harry? How do we become invested in him? He is an orphan and an abused orphan at that. On the one hand, this formula definitely works, but isn\'t it a little over done? JK Rowling also sets up some beautiful scenes like when Harry is receiving his invitation to Hogwarts. How many people actually try that hard? When Ron and Harry discover that Hermione is in danger, they both go to assist her. However, most people these days would go, ""Oh well."" Sorry my INFJ is showing.There were a few things that I didn\'t like:*Why does JK Rowling hate cats? Mr Dursley sees something odd, a cat reading a map. My cats play chess, play the piano, watch TV, and once even typed ""hi"" on my computer. I don\'t find reading a map to be a bit strange at all. Maybe my house is just brimming with magic and as a muggle I just don\'t know about it? Mrs. Figg also made Harry look at photographs of all of the cats that she has ever owned. As if that is some sort of punishment!*How Hermione is treated. When Ron and Harry are in trouble, Ron screams at her, ""Have you gone mad? Are you a witch or not?"" Um Ron, if you treat me like, you can save yourself. At the end of the book, Hermione is never fully rewarded for her portion in saving Ron and Harry, just figuring out the riddle. Even after she was a better person than I.*Quidditch and chess - not really my thing although this opened up a brilliant line of merchandising for the author.*Some things didn\'t make sense to me.

Hermione and Ron are fun characters and I might have enjoyed the book more if they had been the main protagonists. Downsides: I cringed at the excessive fatphobia, anti-semitism, and the turban part. I also didn't like that the final action of the book got skipped over quickly by having a fade-to-black moment and then a lengthy explanation told by one of the side characters.

It was just as wonderfully magical as I remembered, a breath of fresh air during what is usually a stressful time of year for me. I have yet to find a story that feels so pure and childlike that appeals to such a broad range of people. There’s something for everyone here; whether you are 10 or 100, Hogwarts is a place you can escape to and enjoy hearty adventures that you won’t find elsewhere.I truly love all of the characters and feel the entire cast is well done, but my personal favorites are the Weasley twins, Hagrid, and Professor McGonnall. While I’ve seen all the movies and know the general storyline, I’m really excited to experience the story “first hand” and see what all was left out from the films. I’m also intrigued to find out more about each house, especially the ones that took a backseat in this story.

Even those could be just electronic too, and the Books be just like Good Ol\' Video Tapes.A Dystopia, right? very gloomy idea to the world without This novel,The One.Well, in the case you think I\'m exaggerate..Let\'s have,ABrief !!History of Literature in the 90s-------------------------------Well, let’s back to early 90s , where TV is in every house, even in every room, Video sets are there too, rental video stores everywhere, satellite receivers and cable channels growing fast packed with channels for kids & teenagers, making them attached more & more into screens,not to mention Video Games, Game boy and Nintendo…Those of this new generation who read are “weirdos"" or ""nerds” to the rest of their peers.And for those “few who read”, book stores mostly got for them comics and graphic novels, which most of them created early this century.Classic Novels, they read just for Schools and Classes mostly.And New Novels that make Best Seller are the ones made, or will be made, into movies for Julia Roberts, Tom Cruse or any of the 90s Hollywood celebrity, or the ones by Stephen King because ,of course, will be made into movies too.Even these new novels didn\'t live up the selling numbers of Tolkien, Charles Dickens, Agatha Christie-what’s with the British authors and selling numbers :)?-, also in Russia no more Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, no more Hugo in France, inEgyptno more like Naguib Mahfouz & the great authors of the 50s to 70s..No new Big Hit for novels, most of the selling books are those of Speculation about strange & mysterious things in the world or in religion, Dream interpretation , cocking books or celebrities rumors.While in US & UK, Top Selling books mostly the Self Help ones, or those teaching Computers Programming and Web Sites-this brand new huge technology leap back then-No new novels to attract the new generation of kids and teenagers, There\'s few Successful Highlights though, like R.L.Stine’s Goosepumbs in 1992 which made a very good success, and translated in many countries including Egypt.And in Egypt there’s also a very successful project by respectful Publishing house that made “Pocket Novels” for youth, by brilliant Egyptian writers presenting huge variety of novels of many genres, Sci-Fi, Action Thriller, comics, Romance .etc.There’s also “Reading for All”, project by the first lady “Susan Mubarak”, reprinting a huge verity of important books and novels from all over the world in very cheap prices.But all these effort didn\'t attract “more and more” of new youth readers as intended, it just made more and more books for those few who already reads.The vast numbers of those who don’t just read will increase if there isn\'t a BIG new attractiveReading Experienceto get them into reading, specially with the more channels, more movies.But the BIGGEST Obstacle for them to read came out in1994, and became a real phenomenon by 1995....it’sPlaystation, The giant Japanese Gaming leap..Football, Crash, Pepsi man, even the comics heroes also have their games, so why reading Superman, Batman’s comics when you can play them..~~~~~~ A beat. ~~~~~~So by 1996, with this growing leap in Gaming, also the Computer 3D games getting much improved, Books get replaced bit by bit by a gaming controls.So do you think it’s wise for publishers to publish a book for new writer?Of course not, it may not even cover it’s publishing cost.So it was very normal when in this year, 1996, whenJoanne, a 31 years old lady from England , handed the manuscript of her first novel to 12 publishing houses, all of them rejected it...A manuscript of over 200 pages of a novel,that she had hard times in her personal and professional life while writing it,and for children??? Seriously is there still any Child left who still read? it’s 1996, the Era of Playstation and Video Games.But then, the Modest“Bloomsbury“agreed to publish it , with 2 advises for her, first that she’d get a day job, since it’s a little chance of making money in children\'s books.- later she received a grant from the Scottish Arts Council to help her continuing writing.-But the significant advice was to change her pen name cause young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman..So with her name & her grandmother’s ""Kathleen"" come the 2 initial of her pen name..J . k . RowlingAnd in26 June 1997, with 1,000 copies, 500 of which were distributed to libraries, come out in UK, to our World The Greatest..Harry Potter and the Philosopher\'s StoneAnd Bam!! , everything happened so fast..Before the end of this year the novel was awarded many important literary awards in the UK.An American important publisher, Scholastic, won the rights to publish the novel in US, with a huge check Rowling would never dreams of.Just with small change, \'Philosopher\'s Stone\' to be \'Sorcerer\'s Stone\', as the American publisher feared \'Philosopher\'s\' may not be that attractive to young readers..And Thanks to Harry Potter, now Every young readers worldwide know much more about Philosopher\'s Stone\'s legend.In1998Book Two released in UK ,1999in US, winning more literary prizes. And becoming NO.1 Top Selling Book in UK , US and many other countries which start to publish the translated first book.And on8 July 1999, TheFirst Breaking Recordmade when Book Three sold68.000 copiesin just three days after its release in the United Kingdom.. and more copies when it released late 1999 in US..With the fast growing popularity of Harry Potter among readers, more records had been broken..The 3 books takeover the Top Spot in all charts of Best Selling Books for weeks & months, and it\'s even still in hardcover editions.This conquer of the Top Spots made some literary magazines & newspapers separate the \'Harry Potter books\' selling records from the rest of the top selling books, splitting the lists into \'Children Books\' and \'Adult Books\' sections, under pressure from other publishers who were eager to see their books given higher ranking.And then it was year 2000 , where everything is about to change ... forever..The Playstation 2 is out there, and even higher leap in Computer Games..But even with this much of temptations, thousands of children, teens and parents gathered in the Midnight of8 July 2000in UK and US at the same day in front of stores, not in front of Cinemas as usual, not electronic stores as Apple storesas happening theses days, But it was in front ofBookstores, for The First time in the Book Stores History, to buy a copy of...Harry Potter and the Goblet of FireAnd They didn\'t mind to find out that the book is over 700 page, it was even for their pleasure, more than double the size of any of the first 3 novels.. double the thriller, double the fun..Over 3 million copies sold at that day only in the US , a New World Record, totally unexpected one.Huge story, bigger plot , mysterious and very well written.And more literate prizes for Rowling... more translated editions to more than 40 language.And a huge budget for the upcoming first movie of the series, which beautifully visualize the magic of the novel by the faithful producers and the director...and it also made some Cinematic Records back then,but that\'s not our subject now.~~~~~~ ~~~~~~With the announcement of pushing the publishing date of Book Five to mid. 2003 , and with 2 movies out so far, The Hunger for reading Harry Potter kept on..So, As more readers from this generation start to increase , Publishers and Book Stores start to promote for more books for those readers who are hungry for more..Older Fantasy books , like Lord of the Rings-which was a super successful movie by then too-Narnia , Golden Compass and many other novels start getting more reprinted editions. And so Book Stores prosperity increased as it get more and more readers.More countries welcomed the Harry Potter phenomenon.. The English edition AND the local translated ones , both been sold everywhere worldwide.Even inEgyptEnglish edition sold at many books stores. And, hopefully, some New Book Stores specialized in English novels and books start to open in Cairo & Alexandria by 2002-2003..And in summer 2002, after the Movie wild success, Nahdet Masr publishing house got the rights and published the Arabic edition.Although it cut some of the lines for length issues, the edition still hold the magic of it ..making a very good sales.~~~~~~ ~~~~~~The good news is, the literary movement didn\'t stop there, Harry Potter and Reprinted Classics. No , there\'s more new books come out for the increasing demand from the readers..By2002,Life of Pi, Man Booker winner make very good sales numbers.And inApril 2003Dan Brown(previously published 3 novels, making good sales)released a novel that made Huge Fuss around and making a new sales records,The Da Vinci Code..The funny thing that there\'s a reference in this novel that Harry Potter is \'the Second Most Selling Book in History after the Bible\', a speculation that happens to be true in less than 5 years after that.A month later,May 2003, Khaled Hosseini released his first novel,The Kate Runnerwhich also made a very good records too.-Don\'t you agree if there\'s no Harry Potter before, this Afghan-born author would have a chance?

Tolkien did, and then wane.The official newspaper of our dominant counter-culture, The New York Times, has been startled by the Potter books into establishing a new policy for its not very literate book review. Rather than crowd out the Grishams, Clancys, Crichtons, Kings, and other vastly popular prose fictions on its fiction bestseller list, the Potter volumes will now lead a separate children\'s list. J. K. Rowling, the chronicler of Harry Potter, thus has an unusual distinction: She has changed the policy of the policy-maker.Imaginative VisionI read new children\'s literature, when I can find some of any value, but had not tried Rowling until now. I have just concluded the 300 pages of the first book in the series, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\'s Stone,"" purportedly the best of the lot. Though the book is not well written, that is not in itself a crucial liability. It is much better to see the movie, ""The Wizard of Oz,"" than to read the book upon which it was based, but even the book possessed an authentic imaginative vision. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\'s Stone"" does not, so that one needs to look elsewhere for the book\'s (and its sequels\') remarkable success. Such speculation should follow an account of how and why Harry Potter asks to be read.The ultimate model for Harry Potter is ""Tom Brown\'s School Days"" by Thomas Hughes, published in 1857. The book depicts the Rugby School presided over by the formidable Thomas Arnold, remembered now primarily as the father of Matthew Arnold, the Victorian critic-poet. But Hughes\' book, still quite readable, was realism, not fantasy. Rowling has taken ""Tom Brown\'s School Days"" and re-seen it in the magical mirror of Tolkein. The resultant blend of a schoolboy ethos with a liberation from the constraints of reality-testing may read oddly to me, but is exactly what millions of children and their parents desire and welcome at this time.In what follows, I may at times indicate some of the inadequacies of ""Harry Potter."" But I will keep in mind that a host are reading it who simply will not read superior fare, such as Kenneth Grahame\'s ""The Wind in the Willows"" or the ""Alice"" books of Lewis Carroll. Is it better that they read Rowling than not read at all? Will they advance from Rowling to more difficult pleasures?Rowling presents two Englands, mundane and magical, divided not by social classes, but by the distinction between the ""perfectly normal"" (mean and selfish) and the adherents of sorcery. The sorcerers indeed seem as middle-class as the Muggles, the name the witches and wizards give to the common sort, since those addicted to magic send their sons and daughters off to Hogwarts, a Rugby school where only witchcraft and wizardry are taught. Hogwarts is presided over by Albus Dumbeldore as Headmaster, he being Rowling\'s version of Tolkein\'s Gandalf. The young future sorcerers are just like any other budding Britons, only more so, sports and food being primary preoccupations. (Sex barely enters into Rowling\'s cosmos, at least in the first volume.)----------------------------The first half of a little piece I wrote from theJournalin July 2000.

So here it is again, may it stick around this time!”It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.”Okay, here’s the thing: There are already 96.502 reviews about this book on goodreads and I think it’s safe to say that mine will carry no weight. *lol*So I decided to make this a short “my thoughts about this book” review. ;-P1.)”Thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and father. “That’s two less than last year.”I totally forgot how horrible the Dursleys are and I think I kind of suppressed how dreadful Dudley is! Such a spoilt brat and this is actually putting it more than just lightly. If anyone should go to a boot camp sort of school it certainly should be him.2.)”Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said Hagrid. “Harry – yer a wizard.”Bless Hagrid for being the kind and compassionate man that he is! <3 Those lines went down in Harry Potter history and started it all! XD3.)”Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet.”“Great idea though, thanks, Mum.”Haha! You gotta love the Weasley twins! They might be side characters but they always manage to bring some humour into the book and they succeed to give that typical sibling and family vibe. =)4.)”Are you sure that’s a real spell?” said the girl. “Well, it’s not very good, is it? I’ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it’s all worked for me.”When I read this I totally had the Hermione of the movie in my mind. Emma Watson played her so well and I’m really glad that Hermione came off her high horse. She was really insufferable at the beginning of the book. *lol*5.)”You’ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.”Urgh! And so it begins! I never liked Malfoy and I’ll never do. Sorry, guys! Yes, I felt sorry for him after book 5 but he’s still a slimy little spoilt brat at the beginning of the series. Still, if his parents would have raised him differently he might have even turned out to be a nice guy. *sighs*6.)”Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?”And here comes another character I’ll never forgive. Snape is a horrible teacher and an even worse human being. There I said it. Nothing that happens over the course of the following books will change anything about the fact that he’s unfair and mean to his students! His past doesn’t excuse his actions. Still, I gotta give Rowling kudos for all the foreboding! Boy, alone the comment with the bezoar. XD And Dumbledore explaining the relationship between Snape and Harry’s father. Well done! ;-)7.)”But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can’t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.”I still love that scene and I’m really glad Hermione and the others finally bonded. Also, I love that they tried to be good kids at the beginning. In the first book they actually don’t want to do anything forbidden and feel bad about it. Well, and then the other books happen. *LOL* Apparently practice makes perfect though, because they go for plenty of forbidden things but don’t get caught anymore. Haha!8.)”All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I’m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.”Lee Jordan is the best! <3 He’s the main reason I enjoy the Quidditch games so much! His commentary is just funny and brilliant!9.)”If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there. It’s only dying a bit later than I would have done, because I’m never going over to the Dark Side!”I LOVE HARRY’S DEFIANCE!!! That’s one of the many things that made me like him so much! He never backs down and always continues to fight. No matter the odds, he’s facing his troubles holding his head high! Even this early in the series you can already see that he’s going to be a great MC!And now let’s move on and read book two! ;-)'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""We don't support transphobes in this house""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""On my list ofreasonswhymy daughtersare thebestest thingto ever happen to me,Number 14,577is that they gave me, at41 years old, the perfectexcuseto revisit theHarry Potterseries.When my oldest angel told me she wanted to start reading the Harry Potter books, I couldn’t have been happier. As I was collecting all seven volumes off the shelf to bring up to her room, I started feeling nostalgic for the whole Hogwarts gang, and I realized that I’d never done more than a perfunctory review of this first volume. I figured it was high time to rectify that oversight.Harry deserves it.However, with over a million ratings, and almost two reviews for every day I’ve been alive, I think I can dispense with any plot distillation or character profiles. It has all been eloquently said before. Therefore, I just want to briefly express what I see as the essential magic at the heart of the series, and why I think it has resonated so strongly with so many people.Here goes...Only rarely does a story come along that can so completely wrap you up in a warm blanket of contentment and good feelings. One that can hold at bay, even if only for precious moments, the nasty brutishness of what often passes for daily life. These stories do that.It’s an escape into a world of optimism, honor, and hope, where things always look hopeful and anything is possible. Who wouldn't want to hang around in a place like that, especially when it is decorated with sorting hats, kindly giants, magic wands and Quidditch.Granted...no aspect of the story is revolutionary, or even particularly noteworthy, from the standpoint of blazing new trails within the fantasy genre. It isn’t great literature, and nothing about its technical merits makes it befitting of even a fraction of its unprecedented success.Fine...acknowledged. And? So what!The virtue of this story is the postive feelings it conjures in its readers. Harry’s story is something that radiates acceptance, inclusion, and friendship. It invokes a sense of belonging. Inside these pages, you can find the impetus to see the better angels of humanity’s nature, and feel just a little better about the world around you.How is that not worthy of praise?As for Harry himself, he’s just a good kid. The quintessential everyman who makes good. A loving boy with a clear head on his shoulders and a caring heart that pumps affection for the world around him. He’s someone you can’t help but like.He’s not perfect. He makes mistakes, he’s occasionally short sighted, and I know many of us wish he would stick up for himself a little more. Maybe reduce his aunt and uncle to a pair of fatty stains on the carpet, or give Dudley an atomic wedgie until his skivvies scrape against his pancreas.But that’s not Harry. He’s a better person than that. That’s why we love him.Maybe all of the above is a bit much. Like I said, I was feeling nostalgic and maybe the gush got a tad away from me. Let’s just say that these stories are perfect comfort food and reading them will make you happy.I’ll certainly settle for that.As for the rating, I Initially only gave this first volume 3 stars, and I’m not going to change that now. As much as I love the series as a whole, I don’t think it reaches stratospheric heights untilHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.Still, this is where it all began. As such, it should be read and savored knowing that it only gets better.3.0 stars. Highly Recommended.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""As wonderful and magical as promised. Because I didn't remember the movie, the third act of the book was a delightful surprise to me.I wish I'd had this book when I was a kid, because the idea that someone could be special without knowing it, and then get to visit a special world where the things that made him different were the same things that made him awesome would have been really inspiring to me.Anne's finishing this, too, and I have to wait for her before I start in on the second book ... HURRY UP ANNE!""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '❝This boy will be famous. There won\'t be a child in our world who doesn\'t know his name.❞Everyone grew up with Harry Potter. They read all the books when they were young and watched all the films. They would re-watch and re-read them. They would fall in love with the Wizarding World and would completely adore Harry, Ron, and Hermione. They would talk about them non stop, about Hogwarts, about its teachings, about them wanting to become students there and pretending they are, about joining the HP fandom, about loving every character and instantly missing the world. Everyone would adore Harry Potter and knew about it since they were young ones.Except me.I didn\'t grow up with Harry Potter. Not because I didn\'t get to, but because I chose not to. I know, it\'s like living a life where everything has been a lie. Worse even. It\'s just, the movies would appear on my tv. From the first one, to the next and the next, and every time I saw the trailer for the upcoming one, I wouldn\'t be interested and would skip it when I came to it. I wouldn\'t bother and wouldn\'t care, and that made a big problem in my life now. Here I am now, being left out because of such poor choices and decisions I made when I was 7, 8, 9, and older until now. But now, as 2016 and having over 500 friends that are caught up and have read the recently published novel,Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,I have finally read the first book and am able to continue the series and watch the films. Now, here I am, wishing to go back to my past and change this nightmare and actually watch the films or read the books because I have literally missed on so much, missed too much, and have been missing too much. I have been out of this world and never realized how good it is, and how special it already has become.There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it.Harry Potteris one of the most famous, loved, and top series out there. It is loved, adored, cherished, and amazing for HP fans every time they read it. No matter how many times it is read, it fills the person\'s heart with warmth and happiness, as they are going back to the wizarding world. As for me, I have finally entered it and feel young and new and early to this, because I am new to this all.Other than that, Harry Potter is considered a Children\'s book but in my opinion, it\'s in between middle grade and young adult because it can be hard to read for some. Although it was very very easy for me to read and understand, I see myself reading this all these years before and having a lot of trouble pronouncing some names.Harry Potter, a story about a young wizard that didn\'t even know he was a wizard. Harry Potter, a 10 year-old boy, who turned 11, is living with his horrible, rude and awful ""family"", The Dursleys. Mrs. Dursley is known as Harry Potter\'s mother\'s sister. The problem is, they didn\'t like each other, nor blend in with each other. They were different. Her sister was a witch, while she was just a Muggle, a person who cannot seek the magic and find it, nothing and no one special because they aren\'t able to turn things into other things, aren\'t able to fly on a broom, cast a robe on fire, defeat a villain, confuse a troll, aren\'t able to do anything, really.The reason for Harry living with this family and having to go trough all this trouble and mess is because he was actually given to them by Professor Albus Dumbledore, known as one of the greatest wizards and the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. When Harry was a baby, his parents were killed by Everyone-Knows-Who but as he tried killing Harry, he really wasn\'t able to. His mother was killed because she was trying to stop him, but as he tried killing Harry, he couldn\'t bare to do it and left him a scar, the scar that has made Harry known and popular for surviving this evil person. Once saved and taken, the only people they can rely on are The Dursleys, and as Harry grows, they expect them to tell him he is a wizard and tell him everything and fix all the lies. Except they don\'t.As days pass, Harry has been getting letters from someone he doesn\'t know. He doesn\'t know who it is and what they want, but he knows there is something going on, due to the amount of letters being sent. After getting the chance to open the first one, his Uncle Vernon decides to snatch it away from him, read it, and burn it. He knows, he knows who it is and what they want, but he doesn\'t want Harry to know. But even with him burning letter by letter and collecting them all, letters keep arriving and arriving, until the person finally shows up face-to-face with The Dursleys and Harry on his 11th birthday.He\'s huge, introduced as a half-giant and half-human, known as Rubeus Hagrid. Hagrid is the one who tells Harry the truth, telling him he is a wizard, and a well-known one as well. He\'s got talent, and has some of the same abilities as his parents. One being a witch and the other being a wizard, Harry is known as a wizard as well. And as Hagrid tells him the truth, Harry does too.He doesn\'t know what he is talking about and doesn\'t know what is going on.He doesn\'t believe he is a wizard, and doesn\'t believe the reason for his parent\'s deaths. But of course, Hagrid decides to tell him the truth and tell him his parents did not die on a car crash, for that seemed impossible, but they were killed by Everyone-Knows-Who and is the reason for his scar.When Harry leaves with Hagrid, they go and buy him what he needs, including clothes and supplies for the school. As they go to the shop, he is introduced as Harry himself but is instantly known by everyone else. Everyone is pleased to meet him and feel proud because they have shaken his hand. He\'s famous, his name is everywhere, and he can be considered a legend for what happened. But even with all this going on, Harry is still a little confused and figuring things out. As Harry and Hagrid get what they need, it\'s time for Harry to go to school, where he meets Ron Weasley, as to what I know, one of his best friends. Ron is small, red-haired, has freckles, pale, and has two twin brothers going to Hogwarts with him. He\'s not accepted into the other groups, and that is why he blends in with Harry and becomes his friend. Harry also meets Hermione Granger, known as someone annoying and as a nightmare to them both because of how bossy and unrealistic she can be. Of course, they are all so small and Hermione is a little nerd that enjoys every teaching at this school, so I was just like ""we get it.""Days pass, and Harry is being trained. He\'s a neutral to broom-stick flying, is able to play Quidditch, the most popular game in Hogwarts, is given special supplies, and is of course, known by everyone. Other than that, Harry suspects his own secrets and wants to find out truths, but in order to do that, he must find a way to find them and figure them out. With the help of his two friends, he might just be able to figure out the real reason behind him being a wizard, more about his parents, history about himself, who this ""You-Know-Who"" person is, remember his past, and see how his life really will be changed, forever.Humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.Harry Potter was easy to read, understand, and there was no hesitation when it came to rating it 5 stars. Now, I hate myself once again and ask myself, again, ""Why did I not read this earlier?"" The answer is obvious, because I already know it and it\'s because I was never a fan of it. I hate speaking about my past, but this is one ugly past and I hate it. I hate the choice I made and I hate myself for allowing it. But soon I\'ll get over it and will be able to re-read this as many times as I will be able to during my last 3 years of being a teen. Yes, a 15 year-old that has not read Harry Potter simply because she chose not to when she was able to and when she was young.PATHETIC.The fantasy is cute, I will say. It\'s easy to understand and the book is easy to fly through. It\'s not long, it\'s not hard, and it\'s not boring. It\'s gripping, fun, and everything is filled with some kind of magical element that has me turning page by page. Having no regrets anywhere, I am finally able to talk about HP and the world of wizards, where students learn how to make potions, talk to ghosts, learn about other creatures, transform things into other things, read minds, become invisible, fly in the air with a broomstick, play soccer in the air, have a feast and enjoy it all, learn magic, have a wand, and just be filled with happiness because of the friends and families considered in the houses. Well, I guess in most.Everything was fun to read. I laughed at some parts and found the story to be more affective to me as Harry was figuring out his new and changed life. He was confused, but he found out a lot more. There\'s still more, but I know that as he grows, I will be able to follow along the late ass journey and see where he grows to and how. I\'ll see how strong he gets and find out some strengths and weakness\'. I\'ll be able to join an invisible magic carpet and fly through the series because I just want to know what happens next and how everything goes. I want to see Harry become a better person and be able to prove Draco and his stupid friends wrong about what they think. I want his friendship with Ron to grow and become stronger. I want Hermione to stop being so talkative and take a little break of being so bossy. But more importantly, I want to have a fun journey reading this and feeling like I\'m on an adventure. Reading it for the first time feels like one. I\'ve never watched the films. I\'ve watched parts, but skipped them. Now, I won\'t skip anything. It\'s like an adventure where I\'m dived in and can\'t seem to leave because I\'m so alive and intrigued.What can I say about Harry Potter that others have not said? Nothing. Reviews are always similar, and this one might be too. Everyone loves it, and so did I. Yes, I rolled my eyes at times because there were moments where I was annoyed. But nothing was boring, and even when I rolled my eyes, there was a reason for that eye rolling scene. Maybe it was Hermione being annoying, or Draco being a rude boy, mocking an adorable red-haired. Or both. But I was also laughing. I would always laugh when it came to Hagrid. Since the beginning, I instantly loved him and considered him hilarious. I love how he turned Dunley into a pig but failed because he was already too much of a pig. I remember laughing and noticing my parents looked at me weirdly, but that\'s okay because I needed a novel where I was happy and ended up laughing at times. Oh and also, Hagrid is honestly so nice and adorable guys, I love him. He\'s so funny and protective and is such a good friend to Harry. I loved everything he did for him and was glad he was the first one to introduce himself to Harry. He cared for him since he was a baby and saw him as 11, bring him a present and giving him another one at the end.Ron is honestly the cutest. I don\'t understand how anyone could be mean to him. He may be weak, but he has his own strengths. He\'s so adorable and small and I hated how Draco treated him. There were some times unnecessary and I hated Draco for it, but I\'ll probably end up loving Draco some time throughout the series and probably regret it because I know he\'s still gonna be really mean throughout the series. I\'m sure. I haven\'t spoiled myself, so I have no idea how his or anyone else\'s life goes, but I do know that he changes in some way. Hermione is a small and cute nerd as well, but sometimes I hated how sassy she was and bossy. She hated losing points for her house and because she, Ron, and Harry were in the same house, they had to work together and find a way to become friends to find out other truths and earn points for Gryffindor. She took everything very serious and showed off at times because of her perfect test grades and assignments, but I was glad she was able to put up with Ron and Harry while they put up with her.The friendship between Harry, Ron and Hermione was probably one of my favorites. I know it didn\'t work out at first and they honestly hated her, but I was so happy it literally had to work toward the middle. Thanks to the troll, she became their friend and actually was able to cooperate with them. She didn\'t yell at them for fighting the troll, but instead told them to be careful and send word if anything goes wrong when Harry went for the mirror again. As it was ending, she was saying goodbye to Harry and Ron and was even awkward because she couldn\'t really figure out what to say. But also, my heart was really happy when she hugged Harry because it felt real and it felt like something I had been waiting since the beginning. It was friendship goals as they were becoming friends, and it just made me happy seeing them all together, same house, same team, same classes.The writing of course is, like I said, easy to understand. There were no words that were confusing in any way or words that got me mixed up because of how similar they sounded, and there were no problems. I didn\'t know what was gonna happen next and I know books are always better than movies, but I will watch the films after or after finishing one book just to see the differences. I hear they are kind of the same, just that the book provides some more information and detail. Like always, it\'s no surprise.There are some things you can\'t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.Overall, I am so proud of myself for getting the first book over with, now wanting the 2nd and the 3rd and the rest. Really excited to see where this all goes to, and how Harry becomes a better wizard.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""How can more than half of my Goodreads friends be wrong with this?I have to get this right.

(But she is my friend and it is her right, so why question?)When the book came out in 1998, I was not yet a bookworm so I brushed this aside. I read only those books that my brother told me to read. He was the bookworm but he would not be caught reading any book being pushed by media hype. However, when Warner Bros. released the film adaptation in 2001, my daughter was 6 years old and I thought that, since there was too much hype, the movie must be good and we would have a memorable time with our first ever father-daughter movie date. I was wrong. She not only got scared because of the darkness inside the movie house but she trembled with fear during the life-size human chess game, in that scene when Ron was sacrificed. We left the movie in that scene with my daughter crying and me cursing it:I will never read Harry Potter.My daughter is now 15 going 16. She is not fond of movies and she still does not show interest on reading Harry Potter. However, I am now a bookworm and the other week, I was with my 4 Goodreads friends and 3 of them raved (two of them, again) about Harry Potter books. Oh well, first-time fathers can make mistakes about first movie date with their daughters, Book 1 is included in 500 Must Read Books and the book must be a quick read. So the following day, I bought my copy.After 13 years of the book's existence and me ignoring it, did I finally make a good decision of reading it? Are all of those 39 friends of mine in Goodreads wrong in giving this 5 stars? Most of them did not bother writing a review. Maybe those would be too long or maybe they read this when they were not in Goodreads yet.

I love Harry Potter.Yes, I agree about the story being great and J. K. Rowling being creative.I was secretly wishing I was studying in Hogwarts too! It was silly, but I was simply enraptured by Harry Potter. Honestly, I still am :) It was a great book. I enjoyed reading itComing from one of my favorite reviewers in Goodreads. I do not share her wanting to be a sorcerer though.Honestly, I don't know anybody who'd refuse to even entertain the thought of attending a school for wizards.Another one of my favorite reviewers. That seems to have nailed this. Young people wanting to be in Hogwarts and study sorcery. That should be it! The world seems to be a dreadful place that we would all like to have powers to turn our enemies into frogs, pigs, ride on a broomstick and get the Snitch and earn points (money) for our family!Oh well, the Bible says that sorcery is Satan's work. The book even used the word Transfiguration as a subject in the sorcery school. Blasphemy.Just kidding. This is a work of fiction and I am not too old to appreciate it. I was just kidding. To be frank, I tried hard not to like this. I thought that giving this a 1 or 2 will freak out my friends and somehow get votes from those who are, up to now, ignoring this book.I told you so!

The Midnight Library
",Matt Haig,3.99,2023247,1203,"Fiction, Fantasy, Audiobook, Contemporary, Magical Realism, Science Fiction, Mental Health",288,13-08-2020,"Between life and death there is a library.When Nora Seed finds herself in the Midnight Library, she has a chance to make things right. Up until now, her life has been full of misery and regret. She feels she has let everyone down, including herself. But things are about to change.The books in the Midnight Library enable Nora to live as if she had done things differently. With the help of an old friend, she can now undo every one of her regrets as she tries to work out her perfect life. But things aren't always what she imagined they'd be, and soon her choices place the library and herself in extreme danger.Before time runs out, she must answer the ultimate question: what is the best way to live?","[{'rating': 2, 'content': 'I liked this book until it suddenly decided to moonlight as a self-help manual, replete with messages that would look great and profound on an Instagram post next to a well-posed cup of coffee with those foam pictures on top. Or embroidered on a pillow — pick your poison.“She realised that she hadn’t tried to end her life because she was miserable, but because she had managed to convince herself that there was no way out of her misery.”And these messages have the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Forget the readers figuring it out for themselves — no, the moral and the take-home points will be (didactically) in your face, loud and clear, even if it’s awkward and clunky and stops narration in its tracks. Case in point:“As she switched to freestyle she realised it wasn’t her fault that her parents had never been able to love her the way parents were meant to: without condition.”Some of these platitudes would also feel right at home in the Hallmark holiday special movie:“And … and the thing is … the thing is … what we consider to be the most successful route for us to take, actually isn’t. Because too often our view of success is about some external bullshit idea of achievement – an Olympic medal, the ideal husband, a good salary. And we have all these metrics that we try and reach. When really success isn’t something you measure, and life isn’t a race you can win.”And I’m just not big on self-help or motivational books. I find most of them cheesy and corny and really awkward and often so painfully earnest that I just can’t take them seriously. It’s just me - I guess I don’t have the right personality to appreciate them. And so I was not too happy with the turn the story took.—————The premise was interesting, and the beginning actually had me captivated. It’s a story of a woman who’s had her final straw - a whole bunch of final straws, really - and when gripped by the oppressive darkness of depression decides to commit suicide.“Maybe she was just really crap at it. At life.”“She wanted to have a purpose, something to give her a reason to exist. But she had nothing.”This may be why so many of even middle-aged people like reading Young Adult books — there’s something quite comforting about seeing a brand-new person, right at the cusp of adulthood, when all the possibilities are still there and no clocks have yet started ticking, and there is enough time and energy to regroup and move on to the road not yet taken. But Nora is thirty-five, an age considered way too late (especially for women, with that damn idea of a biological clock) to not have it all figured out. It’s not the time (at least for women) when the world is considered to be your oyster —it’s the time when you really are expected to have your shit together. And Nora most certainly does not.“Well, don’t hang about. Tick-tock tick-tock”,says a well-meaning stranger in that unasked-for-but-nonetheless-given bit of advice.“When she thought about it – and increasingly she had been thinking about it – Nora was only able to think of herself in terms of the things she wasn’t. The things she hadn’t been able to become. And there really were quite a lot of things she hadn’t become.”In that moment between life and death Nora finds herself in a library full of books that are the alternate lives she could have had — lives that would have stemmed from one different choice, one different decision. (Jo Walton’s quiet gemMy Real Childrenhad a similar premise, and it was wonderful). And the point is - once Nora finds a perfect life for herself in this endless tapestry of parallel and “perpendicular” lives, she can choose to stay in it and live it as her own.The logical place to start is to revisit all those regrets that weigh her down. And Nora has quite a few of those.“Between life and death there is a library,’ she said. ‘And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices … Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?”And then, after a great beginning (which was not always easy to read given how well Haig was able to capture the snowballing depressing crap happening to Nora)we careen right into the didactic self-help book where each parallel life exists to teach Nora a lesson that sooner or later will be unambiguously spelled out so that we don’t get it wrong.“She realised, in that moment, that she was capable of a lot more than she had known.”And if you had any doubts about the ending, doubt no more. It ends exactly like anyone would have predicted at the beginning of that self-help turn, exceptit’s even more unrealistically saccharine than I even dared to anticipate. It takes a turn into that meaningless “let you be you” drivel that seems to say so much while actually saying very little. It becomes the cotton candy of advice - sweet but of little value.“She didn’t need a vineyard or a Californian sunset to be happy. She didn’t even need a large house and the perfect family. She just needed potential. And she was nothing if not potential. She wondered why she had never seen it before.”And all that relentless hammering of the “profound” message into to readers’ psyche interspersed with tired cliches makes the whole book eventually seem bland and repetitive and tedious and, honestly, a bit trite.“I mean, it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other.”2.5 stars. I did not sign up to read a self-help manual.But my opinion is decidedly in the minority — maybe I’m just a crusty soulless cynic. Oh well.————“You don’t have to understand life. You just have to live it.’Nora shook her head. This was a bit too much for a Philosophy graduate to take.”It’s a bit too much for this science graduate over here, too.——————Also posted onmy blog.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '""That is just me. I add nothing. I am wallowing in self-pity.""No truer words have been said by Nora, the world\'s largest wet blanket. Woe is her, folks.Nora ends up at the Midnight Library, a place between life and death, because she doesn\'t want to live anymore. The library is full of books, each representing a life she could\'ve had had she made different choices. Now she has a chance to undo all her regrets (of which there are many) and try out all the lives she\'s missed out on, to see if there\'s another one she would\'ve liked better.Lest you think I\'m a cold-hearted reader for not loving this, I mean, sure that does sound like me. I count coins in my bathtub, chase children off my lawn with my gnarly walking stick, and club seals for laughs at least once a day, if not more. So what\'s to like? No no, I\'m just kidding. Really.Normally I love sappy, cheesy, inspirational mush. I watch Hallmark movies. I believe in soulmates and happily ever after. I cry during every sweet scene in every movie. And yet this book left me so cold inside, I got absolutely zero feels unless you count frustration as a feel.For one thing, this story doesn\'t come across as fiction so much as self-help disguised as fiction. The lessons to be learned in here are pretty obvious right from the beginning, yet they are presented like some sort of epiphany that can only be discerned if explained slowly and repeatedly. We are forced to endure these same lessons over and over every time Nora goes back to the library. Either Nora is the most dim witted of characters, or the author thinks us readers are.Another problem is that it\'s really hard to connect with Nora. She\'ll take any situation, suck every ounce of joy out of it, and interpret what\'s left in the most negative way possible. She\'s full of regret for every decision she\'s ever made, and thinks the grass is always greener. However, other than being negative, she literally has no other personality traits. She\'s a blank slate, dull and uninteresting.I also have issues with the core messages in this book. Nora finally learns her lesson, but it\'s only after having fixated on each regret, remade every decision, and lived all subsequent lives. Like come on, at some point, you just have to be okay with who you are and the decisions you\'ve made without knowing every single possible outcome.But my biggest issue is that I\'m really uncomfortable with this book\'s implication that if you\'re depressed, you only need to change your mindset and you will feel better. That goes against everything we understand about mental illness, including that it\'s important to seek professional help, that it can be chemically based, and that it\'s not a matter of not trying hard enough.We already have enough trouble as a society getting depression and mental illness taken seriously, without a ""feelgood"" book coming along and implying that you need nothing more than an attitude adjustment to cure it. That puts the blame squarely where it doesn\'t belong, on the hundreds of millions of people who are suffering from depression. But it isn\'t just the layman who harbors such misunderstandings. It also includes people who work in the mental health field, and even some therapists and psychiatrists. So you can understand my dismay at the continued popularity of this book, which further perpetrates this extremely toxic point of view.Please don\'t get me wrong. The message in here about having a positive attitude is a good one, and I\'m all for it. But that worthwhile message slowly but surely got overshadowed by the implication that depression is nothing more than a mindset, and that\'s where I fall off the bandwagon. At times, I\'m left wondering if the author started with the intention of the former and, over the course of writing this story, it somehow got away from him and he ended up with the latter instead.Obviously many readers loved this book, as evidenced by its overwhelmingly favorable reviews. But it\'s decidedly not for me. This is the second book I\'ve read by Matt Haig, and I\'ve pretty much hated both. So I think it\'s time I part ways with this author and just accept that we\'re not compatible.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:How to Stop Time~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""“The only way to learn is to live”Fuck, this book hit me so hard. I finished this book a few days ago and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. It has one of my favorite themes or tropes in a book, where we follow a main character who at the beginning of the story is very depressed and possible suicidal and doesn't see the point of life, but then slowly throughout the story begins to build an admiration toward humanity and life. This book was so beautifully written and I love the way this book asks the question: what is the best way to live?“Between life and death there is a library, and within that library, the shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices… Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?”It's a really cool concept, that between life and death you enter the midnight library, where you get the opportunity to see how your life would've been different had you made different decisions. I think a lot about this, what my life would be like had I made different choices and wondering if I'm the happiest version of myself? This book forces you to ask hard questions, like what makes a life worth living? And are your dreams for yourself really something you want? I love the way this book talks about regrets and how most of the time our regrets are a load of bullshit of things that are out of our control and they are causing a major burden on our life.“A person was like a city. You couldn't let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole. There may be bits you don't like, a few dodgy side streets and suburbs, but the good stuff makes it worth-while.”Matt Haig is such a talented writer and there are so many passages and quotes I'm obsessed with in this book. Much like The Humans (one of my all time favorites) this book has you questioning what the point of life is and thinking how truly absurd life can be. But I feel like this book is much more serious than The Humans, there are trigger warnings for depression and suicidal thoughts in this book, and it was very very heavy on my heart to read this book, where as The Humans feels a lot more light-hearted and hilarious.“It is easy to mourn the lives we aren't living. Easy to wish we'd developed other other talents, said yes to different offers. Easy to wish we'd worked harder, loved better, handled our finances more astutely, been more popular, stayed in the band, gone to Australia, said yes to the coffee or done more bloody yoga. It takes no effort to miss the friends we didn't make and the work we didn't do the people we didn't do and the people we didn't marry and the children we didn't have. It is not difficult to see yourself through the lens of other people, and to wish you were all the different kaleidoscopic versions of you they wanted you to be. It is easy to regret, and keep regretting, ad infinitum, until our time runs out. But it is not lives we regret not living that are the real problem. It is the regret itself. It's the regret that makes us shrivel and wither and feel like our own and other people's worst enemy. We can't tell if any of those other versions would of been better or worse. Those lives are happening, it is true, but you are happening as well, and that is the happening we have to focus on.”But god damn, I loved this book. I cried a lot at the end. I'll be thinking about this book for a long time. I also filmed a reading vlog and I included this book, you can see that here:https://youtu.be/9NiJtrbogyo""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""Everybody probably knows the premise of this book by now (I mean this book iseverywhere): a library with an infinite number of books. The books of regret. You open one and it transfers you to the life where you didn’t make that particular regret. Was it marrying someone or traveling or maybe other little things.While I admit I don’t actively pursue parallel universes kind of books on one hand, and on the other, the main reason why I read this book is that I was choosing the best fiction this year (to vote in the GR awards), I was actually looking forward to it. Most of my friends on GR gave it 5 glowing stars. A book beloved by the majority... I had a high chance of enjoying it. Sadly, I didn’t.First, it was boring. I listened to the audiobook and the narrator wasn’t the best, honestly. Not that her voice was annoying but it was kind of monotone. It certainly didn’t help either that I was listening toEleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fineat the same time, in which the narrator was so animated reading the book.I also found all of Nora’s revelations and enlightenment typical. Like sure I already know that. The ending was also painfully predictable from the start. So when you can guess where the book is going, everything in between becomes not so interesting anymore, especially if you don’t care about the main character. Unfortunately, I found Nora dull. She wasn’t interesting as the main character and I couldn’t relate nor care about her and empathise with her story. I can’t believe she was this multitalented in fields that aren’t related whatsoever to each other. She could’ve been an athlete, a scholar or a musician. All successful. All are based on life decisions. I also think that she had the privilege of choosing such different options. Many don’t. I don’t mean by that the book of regrets but rather focusing on a particular career path from the start. For example, many parents don’t nurture their children’s interests like music or gymnastics for several reasons maybe they can’t afford it or they just don’t care. But Nora had so many options.Luckily, the book was short. I also didn’t hate anything about it, hence the 2-star rating. But at the same time, I can’t name anything I liked. Maybe one of the lives, in particular, was more intriguing than the rest because of the two characters we met and.. the concept. It didn’t help that the book got repetitive sometimes. The premise was much more promising than the book itself. The “message” was also pretty plain obvious. Yet many likedThe Midnight Library, however. So it might be more of a “me and not you” kind of book.But let me tell you this: if you don’t find the parallel universes interesting to read about in stories, don’t read this novel. Don’t be fooled with “LIBRARY. MIDNIGHT LIBRARY. BOOOOOKS.” The library is just more of a metaphor. Most of the events in this book take place in the real world. And unless you’re interested in kind of self-help books (or motivational ones), don’t read this novel either. Because it’s more about what Nora discovered about herself and life, of course, by dealing with/trying to escape from her regrets.But then again, themajorityliked this book so you might too and it's simply notmycup of tea.Yet, itwasa dreadfully boring.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'So, first of all, HUGE thank you to goodreads for featuring my kindle highlights and notes for this book - wow.I never would\'ve expected such an amazing opportunity to share my love for this book NOR would I have expected to ""meet"" so many wonderful people through the comments.It\'s been so much fun and I\'m definitely doing more highlights/notes soon!!The Written ReviewLife has just gotten to the point where it\'soverwhelming and all-encompassingand above all, Nora can\'t see a possible situation where it gets better.Everyone she\'s ever known has pulled away, her job is gone and her best friend in the world passes.All she\'s left with is herself and acripplingly black hole.She slips herself a few too many pills and then drifts...andfinds herself in a library.Not just any library though, the Midnight Library.Guided by a person who may (or may not) be Mrs. Elm (young Nora\'s favorite teacher), Nora begins to take a look at the shelves.And every book is her.

His acute observations and experience of his condition informs this exquisite, inspiring, compassionate and empathetic novel where he creates the concept of the midnight library, to be found in the spaces between life and death, to explore life, the issues that afflict our world, through philosophy and more, endeavouring to tease out what might make life worth living and a joy and what gives it meaning. The device used to implement his goal is the ordinary Nora Seed, who has lived her life trying to please others, who has hit rock bottom, suffering the loss of her cat, her job, overwhelmed by the burden of a lifetime of regrets, seeing no light in her life whatsoever. She is tempted by thoughts of suicide that has her ending up at the midnight library.The midnight library is magical, for a start, the library has a limitless number of books, and these books are far from ordinary, Haig sprinkles gold dust in each book, offering Nora the opportunity to see how her life would have turned out if each and every decision at every point in her life had been different. The books illustrate the endless possibilities that life holds for Nora and all of us. Nora explores each book, with inquisitiveness and curiosity, the widely disparate lives that could have been hers, no easy task as she has to slip into each new life with the complications of being unfamiliar with it and do so without alerting the other people present. It soon becomes clear that there are pros and cons to each book/life, to each decision and choice made, each life containing its own mix of despair, pain and regrets that must be accommodated and handled.Haig offers a touching narrative that speaks of the joys to be found in living, attained through Nora's eyes as she tries to untangle what really matters in life, putting life in context and perspective with all its ongoing changes, complexities, and an understanding no life is perfect in itself. In some ways, this is a version of It's A Wonderful Life, a favourite film for so many people. What I was so struck by is just how many readers might find this helpful for our lock down times, so many have suffered unbearable losses and illness, have had to face not seeing all those we love and mean so much to us, whilst being weighed down with worries and concerns about how to cope with fears regarding jobs, childcare, money and more. A beautifully nuanced novel that I am sure many will love as much as me. Highly recommended. Many thanks to Canongate for an ARC.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Okay! No more words! This is one of the best sci-fi and fantasy mashups of the year, with an added layer of philosophical depth. I LOVED IT! (And this isn’t just the kind of love where you raise your glass and toast the book. No, this is more like standing on the roof and shouting your love to the moon. If you’ve read the song lyrics to “Howl” in the book, you’ll probably understand why I’m so enthusiastic and why I’m writing this loud, passionate review!)This book isn’t just about Nora Seed, a woman trapped in her life, seeing herself as a failure, as disposable, with nothing to achieve and no one who would miss her. It’s about regrets, unfinished plans, “what ifs,” seeking family approval, drugs, mistakes, giving up, living out others’ dreams, self-loathing, insecurities, self-harm, love, passion, and hate.When Nora attempts to end her life, she wakes up in a library filled with books—each one containing a different version of her life story. If she finds the right book, the life in which she’s truly fulfilled and happy, she can be saved.Thankfully, the librarian, Mrs. Elm, is there for her—just as she was when Nora was a little girl grieving her father’s death.Nora could have been so many things: a swimmer, a rock star, a philosopher, a wife, a traveler, a glaciologist, a mother, a winery or pub owner. She could have said “yes” to her ex’s offer to move to a small town and run a pub together. Or she could have accepted a coffee date from Ash, the charming doctor, in pursuit of love and happiness. She could have won Olympic medals or tasted the alluring fame of performing her music all over the world. She could have been anything.But after living through nearly a thousand different lives, will she discover which one is truly the best for her? Which life will allow her to capture real happiness?Can she live without her family, or bear the pain of losing her friends?What does she truly want? What does she expect? And most importantly, will she learn to face the things she regrets most? Because no matter how ready she is to start fresh, the grip of her regrets always pulls her back, preventing her from seeing what she’s truly searching for.Beautiful, meaningful, dazzling, emotional, heart-wrenching, poetic, and realistic—these are the words that come to mind after reading this book.

The best thing about this book is that it's a super quick read with really short chapters.

Of course, as she explores each one of her regrets, they contain a message that, basically, regrets are stupid and there are good and bad aspects to all possible paths.I'm sorry to all the people who liked this and are having to see me grumble. I shouldn't have done it because I knew, deep down, I would not like it.

Or is it the case that depression is a consequence of environment, one’s less than sane immediate family perhaps; or possibly genetics, an historical aberration passed down from family far distant in space and time? Is the world an objectively depressing place; or made so by our attitude towards it? The philosopher Schopenhauer thought depression was an heroic human condition and promoted it by writing about it; Freud thought it was an illness and tried to cure it by talking about it.Haig thinks depression has something to do with regrets, that is, thoughts about what might have been if we had done things differently. And perhaps he has a point. In his view, regrets occur because of alternative histories we fabricate for ourselves in which disappointment with one’s lot is reduced or eliminated because life would be more fulfilling/successful/happy than the life one actually has. Depression, in other words, is a literary phenomenon. It’s a result of the what-if stories. Imaginative, articulate people, therefore, would be particularly susceptible to the condition. There is in fact substantial anecdotal evidence that this might be so (see, for example,https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...)Based on this essentially linguistic theory of depression, Haig has a suggestion for therapy. At this point he crosses the line from playful fictional speculation to a less than savoury quackery worthy of Ayn Rand and Tim LaHaye. Haig thinks that some down-to-earth horror stories are just the thing to augment the happily-ever-after alternatives in our heads. Re-write the script, he implies, picking up all the tiny contra-indications of bliss because“undoing regrets was really a way of making wishes come true.”Or just remember that people, jobs, relationships, and desires change. Perhaps what was the case about these things when the alternative history was written hadn’t persisted. Or the outcomes remain the same despite different choices. Haig’s point, I suppose, is that things could be worse; that maybe Leibniz had it right: this world could be the best of all possible worlds. Disappointment with one’s regrets as a cure for regrets, and therefore a therapy for disabling, suicidal depression?Things could be worse!? That’s your therapeutic message? Are you serious, Matt?Haig even makes a pitch for a sort of group therapy in which those formulating alternatives to the alternatives get together for solace and encouragement. And of course he feels compelled to bring in quantum mechanics to bolster the non-literary reality of simultaneous lives - a cliché I was mightily hoping he might avoid. And the allusion to YHWH as the master of ceremonies (very Leibnizian), in the guise of a benevolent librarian, keeping all the disparate quantum selves in line is pretty cheesy. Ultimately Haig opts for the cheesiest of all criterion for the story one must have about one’s life: authenticity, we must be our realest, bestest, truest self.“Aim to be the truest version of you,”the godly librarian suggests, as if a depressive has a choice in the matter. I think Haig may have been to one too many EST seminars, or at least spent too much time in Southern California reading Heidegger on the beach.Of course in creating these new personal stories another issue eventually arises if one���s authentic self is the depressed wreck one started with. Then“It is quite a revelation to discover that the place you wanted to escape to is the exact same place you escaped from,”says Haig’s protagonist, brought back from the brink of suicidal death. But the important point, according to Haig, is“You just had to never give up on the idea that there would be a life somewhere that could be enjoyed.”Can one help thinking of Eric Idle’s magnificent rendition of ‘Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life’ in theLife Of Brian? Did I mention cheesy.I think it clear thatThe Midnight Libraryis a grave insult to those suffering from depression. It is a facile, trivial, misdirected, and (did I mention?) cheesy book. Am I entirely off-base in thinking Haig wrote it as a feel-good piece for those who just need a little pat on the back for their recovery from a bout of the blues, or a failed love affair?

As Nora was to discover, we all ""fear life"" to some degree - we learn pretty young that actions can have pretty painful consequences.Some of us stare that fear in the face and do what frightens us anyway. Many more of us, however, will step back and opt to take the safer road. I loved the notion of Nora being able to insert herself in a parallel timeline and see how her life would have been like had she taken a chance on all of those potentially life changing events. The whole parallel universe notion was so tantalizing! Imagine if you, too, could examine and then finally burn your own Book of Regrets and just move on with living your best life now?The first third of this novel is heavily mired in depression. If you\'ve never felt stuck or depressed, you will certainly get a clue of what it feels like after you\'ve read or listened to those first few chapters leading up to Nora\'s attempted suicide. There was a history of depression in Nora\'s mother\'s family. I was not surprised that Nora fell into depression after taking care of her mother during her long, protracted illness. Death has a way of stopping the clock for the survivors and making them examine the value of their own life. I suspect there will be many who will identify with most of what Nora thinks and says in this novel.Nora\'s Midnight Library is guarded and managed by her beloved childhood mentor and high school librarian, Mrs. Elm. There are several chapters devoted to Mrs. Elm\'s struggle to get Nora to try to experience one of the parallel lives in her Midnight library. This reflects the very real battle that a person with depression must face to get to the point where they can finally admit that they need help to get ""unstuck."" Matt Haig has given a whole new meaning to the word ""potential."" I totally agreed with Nora\'s final decision at the end of the book. In fact, I saw it coming even before she had completed her first journey. We can\'t live someone else\'s life. The choice must truly be our own if we want any abiding sense of fulfillment.This author - this book - has a lot to teach us.

Not the charming character I expected.Firstly, in her fiery hatred for her ex, she decides to go full arsonist and burn down an entire building. I mean, who does that? Then, as if fire isn\'t enough drama, she moves in with her brother, only to discover his super-hot best friend also resides there. Classic sitcom setup, right? But it gets better – she drinks Colin\'s $4000 tequila on day one, reserved for some divine occasion, and not a hint of an apology. Who raised this person?And oh, the cherry on top – when Colin\'s at work, she decides to catch some sleep in his bed. No apology for that invasion of personal space either. If someone pulled that move in my home, they\'d be strangled by a fucking sheet. Lynn, seriously, you could\'ve written a character with a bit more tact and respect, couldn\'t you?❞𝙃𝙚 𝙬𝙖𝙨 𝙥𝙚𝙧𝙛𝙚𝙘𝙩 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙄 𝙬𝙖𝙨 𝙖 𝙨𝙝𝙞𝙩𝙨𝙝𝙤𝙬. 𝙃𝙚 𝙬𝙖𝙨 𝙖𝙣 𝘼𝙪𝙙𝙞 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙄 𝙬𝙖𝙨 𝙖 𝘾𝙤𝙧𝙤𝙡𝙡𝙖.

I get it, he\'s not real, but come on, even superheroes have their issues. The author seemed to misplace the ""flaw"" button when designing him. Annoyingly perfect, yet strangely more tolerable than Olivia. Maybe perfection has its perks in fictional realms, but a bit of human touch wouldn\'t hurt.So, turns out, he\'s been harboring a secret admiration for Olivia since she moved in with them when he found her intolerable since their high school. Cute, right? Not so fast. The adorable vibes went south when he decided to lie creating a mess. Bravo.Post-mess, he mustered one apologyat least he had courtesy to apologise, and when things got too tough, he opted for the classic ""I\'m leaving the city to avoid heartache"" strategy. Because, you know, seeing her made him sad. Real relationship savior there. Minimal effort, maximum avoidance.And let\'s not forget Jack\'s chill reaction to his best friend sleeping with his sister. As someone with brothers, I call massive bullshit on that one. No way that\'s cool. The only shining light? Sara. Sweetheart alert. Can we please get a story about her and leave the mess behind?❞𝙎𝙝𝙚 𝙬𝙖𝙨 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙛𝙞𝙧𝙨𝙩 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙄 𝙩𝙝𝙤𝙪𝙜𝙝𝙩 𝙤𝙛 𝙬𝙝𝙚𝙣 𝙄 𝙬𝙤𝙠𝙚 𝙪𝙥 𝙞𝙣 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙢𝙤𝙧𝙣𝙞𝙣𝙜, 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙡𝙖𝙨𝙩 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙗𝙚𝙛𝙤𝙧𝙚 𝙄 𝙛𝙚𝙡𝙡 𝙖𝙨𝙡𝙚𝙚𝙥.

Olivia spends the whole time with this random dude thinking it’s the guy she’s been talking to but it’s just Colin manipulating everything to save his own skin. (the guy even later tells Liv how Collin called her pathetic, a shit show, a klutzy puppy right before Colin tells her he “somehow” fell in love with her— so yeah, i would lose my shit too. God forbid you’re attracted to her ffs).soooo... yeah, babes. you are a pretentious douchebag. at leastown it.don’t have the audacity to be offended when you exhibit that kind of behaviour lol.i wanted to give this three stars bcos i enjoyed Olivia a lot. she’s chaotic. unhinged. clumsy. idiotic. reckless. impulsive. immature. and i loved it lol. idk she was funny and entertaining to me. i needed her craziness to drown out Colin’s obnoxious mediocrity (i mean even his dad nailed it and said:“Come on, Colin, shut your obnoxious mouth, will you?”) but Olivia was just hilarious and was the sole reason for my enjoyment. she said some of the stupidest shit that had me cackling. so that alone was pretty perfect.but when finishing the book and reading their reconciliation, i was severely unimpressed so decided to drop a star. i think after several romcom attempts, they’re just not for me. the cliches mixed with the heroines being walking stereotypes and bland douchey heroes are clearly not for me.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""Wow. I hated this. Olivia was completely unlikable and obnoxious. She wasn't unlucky, she was just an inconsiderate asshole. It is not cute to treat someone who is graciously letting you stay in their flat after you burnt down yours (!!!). This is petty but it was truly galaxy brain to me when the author wrote something about the love interest (I cannot remember his name, but he was very boring and didn't have a personality beyond being very hot and rich) owning a sterling silver colander. Babe, those don't exist. Do you mean stainless steel? I know it's so minor, but it truly took me out of the story so much.I don't know why the lying about having kids to take that job plot was even necessary. She literally had been looking for a job for TWO WHOLE DAYS. Surely she could have just waited a bit longer to find a job where she wasn't being dishonest. Wild to me that a woman that wants to work as a journalist (and this is not to say there aren't dishonest journalists out there) would be so comfortable flouting journalistic ethics like that.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'HAPPY PUBLICATION DAY!Mr. Wrong Numberis the right book to pick up if you’re looking for charm, laughs, and just a bit of steam.Olivia Marshall literally has the worst luck ever. Bad things always seem to happen to her, so it’s almost no surprise when she gets fired and then accidentally burns her apartment building down after burning the love letters her cheating ex-boyfriend wrote to her.Now, she’s forced to move in with her brother until she finds a new job and makes enough money to get back on her feet. Unfortunately for her, her brother currently lives with his lifelong best friend, Colin Beck.Olivia always thought Colin was stuck up and arrogant…although she secretly always found him hot. Colin always considered Olivia his friend’s “annoying little sister”.One night, Olivia gets a risque text message from a random phone number. She decides to respond to Mr. Wrong Number, and they start up a titillating and flirtatious text relationship. She looks forward to his messages every day while she tries to maneuver in her crazy life.Colin can’t believe it when he realizes that Miss Misdial, the random woman he’s been texting (and maybe sexting) is none other than his best friend’s annoying sister, Olivia. Do they have a chance to make things work in real life? Or should he just end the texting before their worlds implode?I LOVED this sweet rom-com. Olivia and Colin are amazing characters, and their chemistry is HOT and STRONG! I was rooting for them the entire time, even in that inevitable rom-com moment when something ultimately threatens to pull them apart.Add to that some genuine laughs and extreme charm. What’s not to love?! This also has the perfect amount of heat to satiate most fans of the genre. The partially open door sex scenes don’t feature the infamous “C-Words” or anything very graphic…but you’ll still get the idea of what’s going down.This is the first book I’ve read by author Lynn Painter, but definitely won’t be my last.

But well, me with my best quality — I\'ll give her that benefit of the doubt. Plus, considering that this is not a YA romance, perhaps we will have something good in the house.Regrettably, I am not a bit surprised when this novel also turned out to be another disappointment. This is even worse and I can\'t help but develop Olivia\'s annoying habit of rolling her eyes that sometimes I wonder how she still didn\'t get them squinted from doing it every 60 seconds.I\'ll be benevolent and go with what I enjoyed with Mr. Wrong Number:the romanceThere\'s just something so conspiring in craving the dangers of forbidden romance. The whole ordeal of falling for your brother\'s best friend does sound tempting and I think Lynn Painter went industriously in making sure Colin and Olivia\'s affair didn\'t go to waste as in her previous work. They bantered, helped each other out, and had a few funny scenes here there.It was just a bit stroke of luck that Lynn Painter is being safe with the level of smuttiness. I understand if she was being considerate of her readers since her debut book was YA and she may have not attracted lots of adult readers to begin with, but I think it was clear enough if this is an adult romance, what readers should expect out of it.People read smuts for many reasons; sometimes it\'s for entertainment or experience; sometimes, it\'s just because and I can be a bit of bothor more. It’s not like I’m being demanding of what is unnecessary. As for this case, I think if there will be a bit more details than a close-door scene, it will help to flesh out both Colin and Olivia\'s chemistry. The romance was enjoyable but it did not hit the roof. Why is that? Now let\'s get to the nastiest part of my review.“When things don\'t go as planned, we can either pout and behave like a reticent child, or take some time to reconsider our choices. Ruminate over what we\'ve done in our past, and how best to move forward in our future.”The book\'s main takeaway was on finding yourself and never stopping at failures. I appreciate the themes that Lynn Painter is going for. It was a good reminder and I honestly get the message she was trying to set forth. It was relatable, especially when you\'re struggling, had a parent who always brings you down and I guess, overall miserable.Frankly speaking though, it was a bit hard to swallow when none of the characters are likable. Now that I\'ve met Olivia, I believe the author just loves to write her heroines ✨quirky✨ and ✨different✨ and Olivia\'s entire personality is just her series of unfortunate events. She was so one-dimensional; it was either being clumsy or hypercritical. I noticed that Painters likes to make a point of her characters\' traits by having them repetitively signified all the time.I was having a hard time resonating with Olivia because she pisses me off a lot with her immaturity and scathing mind. This book utilized such a disgraceful kind of miscommunication trope and I did not dig it one bit. It makes sense when it happened to the author\'s YA characters because they don\'t suppose to have most things figured out, but when you\'re reaching your 30s, I\'m expecting a bit of rationality on your end. Both the MCs seem to age backwards instead of their own prime.""He\'s still an asshole. He looks at me like he knows he\'s better than me""While I appreciate Colin\'s POV (because I can\'t remember if we had one for Wes), it was unavailing at first because it was just more of his reaction and thoughts on Olivia instead of letting readers unravel him as a person. And when you\'re relying on a disparaging worldview of a heroine to allow you to get to know the other characters, it didn\'t help your case.I believe it was not Lynn\'s intention to give a lot of focus to Colin but it was only the latter that we get to know more of him than just ""the love interest"" or the ""jerk"" as claimed by the Queen of Rolling Eyes. For a good part, the author didn\'t give room for any lewd thoughts or objectification from Colin in feigning his attraction to Olivia. Like, he was just appreciating her as a real person and it\'s refreshing. He lives up to his status quo and that’s the only matchable piece of himself as a grown successful man.Having that said, did I enjoy the book? Still NO, or maybe, if only the characters, the plot, and the romance were parallel from the beginning. The beam scale was skewed all the time for when the romance was good, the characters were there to ruin the whole course of the book or vice versa. The plot was absurd and a lot of thing just doesn’t make sense.What\'s more now that my hypothesis is correct, it\'s best to say, it was nice to read Lynn Painters\' works as this will be my lastor not.Let\'s just hope she didn\'t come out with pretty covers that got me weak all the time because who judges a book by its cover?

Yes, but it was also absolutely adorable and genuinely fun. Olivia gives off \'Bridget Jones\'-level clumsiness and ‘Lindsey Lohan Just my Luck’-level bad luck, so a little bit of a mess might be an understatement. At her rock bottom she receives an anonymous ""what are you wearing?"" text that seems to be sent to the wrong number. With her whirlwind, go with the flow attitude she decides to answer and leads us into something that starts as an innocent flirt with lots of banter with Mr. Wrong Number, who just happens to be her brothers über serious best friend and her current roommate.✧ “Are you terrified that I’m rubbing off on you?”I stared at her freckles and stubborn chin and swallowed hard as emotion tightened my throat. What if she was rubbing off on me? God, the beautiful, glorious mess. Liv’s passion for living was almost a tangible thing, so alive and loud that it nearly had its own identity. To have that rub off on me, even a little? Fuck. That would make me the luckiest man on the planet, wouldn’t it? ✧ (Bonus Chapter 1)It would be easy for me to nitpick this, but honestly I had a great time(I could\'ve done with fewer \'Ohmigods\' though, as a personal preference).It gives off that classic romcom feel, it might be silly and a bit stupid but I truly felt with the characters. I cringed at times, laughed at other times, I was sad when they were sad, I simply fell in love with their love.🧡Their tension, banter and easygoingness are all the things I love.The ending and epilogue felt a bit too fast in my opinion, so the two bonus chapters(found on Lynn\'s website) truly made their story feel complete. Can strongly recommend those for anyone picking this up.

Not as lucky for her, she doesn’t realize that this roommate is Jack’s best friend since childhood, Colin Beck, who’s only ever seen her as Jack’s bratty little sister and now older snarkastic one.(Yes … ‘snarkastic’ is a word, if you count Urban Dictionary as a source, and I LOVE it. If you’re listening Mirriam-Webster, et al., please officially add it? I digress.)It’s a good thing Olivia has a mysterious new anonymous friend to vent to about her annoying situation. They’ve been texting regularly since the night he accidentally messaged her asking what she was wearing, and she’s become Miss Misdial to his Mr. Wrong Number. As the discussions get more personal, it’s amazing how much they have in common … especially when it comes to certain “appetites”, shall we say?Where does this all lead, and does Olivia get back on her feet and maybe find love in the process?Silly question. It’s a rom-com. You know the drill. That’s like asking if the sun is going to rise in the morning.Lynn Painter has written an incredibly witty, charming rom-com with hilarious banter, lots of Olivia’s funny klutzy moments and missteps, and a heaping helping of chemistry and sizzle. Seriously … is it hot in here? My only complaint is that she could sound a bit immature, but it didn’t take away from my enjoyment.I listened to this on audiobook while reading along on my Kindle, which was perfect.

Okay this is gonna sound hella pretentious but the writing and storytelling had a frenetic energy that you expect from a classic romcom. Yes, things are exaggerated and unrealistic, but it\'s all for comedic effect. If you prefer a book where you can walk a thousand miles in the FMCs shoes, choose something else.Is Olivia an absolute shit show hot mess? Absolutely. Does she have the maturity of a toddler? It would be remiss to deny this. She needs to child-proof her apartment and wear a helmet at all times to keep herself safe. I can see a lot of people getting annoyed with the fact she can\'t walk straight without somehow tearing her ACL and simultaneously throat punching an unsuspecting passerby. She was like a hybrid of Kimmy Schmidt and Mindy Lahiri with a dash of bath salts. Just a dash, though.Usually romance books capture a snapshot of the FMC and MMCs ""love"" story, but I was surprised by how ""complete"" their relationship timeline was. You truly got a beginning (texts), middle (reveal + smash), and end (third-act conflict and resolution) without feeling rushed.Initially I wasn\'t the biggest fan of Colin: he had a 2x4 shoved up his ass, he made several unnecessary diet comments, and the only reason he started looking at Olivia differently was because of the sexting. Not a great look that he didn\'t notice Olivia\'s personality until she said she loves hot \'n fast sex (sponsored by Little Ceasars hot \'n ready pizza) but he redeemed himself in the end thankfully.I haven\'t found a romcom without at least one severely punchable character and this one was no different. Without further ado, I present the most punchable award to Olivia\'s mother, Nancy. Step right up and claim your prize: these hands. What an absolute POS.Overall, I wouldn\'t recommend this with chest, but I enjoy a romcom that gives me early 2000s chaotic vibes so this worked for me.pros & conspros: funny, less annoying than The Love Wager, gave me early 2000s romcoms when they were hella chaotic and a smidge (++++) problematic with imperfect characters that you somehow rooted for, a true three-act romcomcons: both MMCs in this and The Love Wager had a penchant for tousling the FMCs hair and that needs to stop immediately, questionable moments for sure, Colin wasn\'t my fave at first, Nancy!!! someone needs to check her ass__Check out my YouTube'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Książki Lynn to miłość i życie'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'pls why did I read this so fast? barry allen 🤝 me, you know?

My romantic heart was so happy with it. Perfect for this month of February!Olivia Marshall has a reputation. She finds herself in weird situations like the last one that has ended her up without a home. She was burning the love letters from her ex-boyfriend when her apartment went up in smoke. Not having a place to live, she moves into her brother\'s condo.Her brother shares a room with his best friend Colin Beck, Olivia\'s nemesis. Olivia had a HUGE crush on Colin since she first met him as a teenager but after a while, it turned into hate. In her mind, he has nothing but behaved as douche to her over the years. Yes, he is still sexy or maybe even better looking now but who is looking at his abs? To her shock, she starts noticing nice things about him when he is not teasing her any longer.But Olivia is in a conundrum. She is starting to like Colin as a person but she has created this friendship over text with a stranger, Mr. Wrong Number. Their textship begins when he sends her a text meant for someone else. Over the next few weeks, they are happy to interact this way. Olivia starts relying on Mr. Wrong Number while they bounced back ideas about life and plans for the future.Who would Olivia pick? Colin or Mr. Wrong Number???Did I crush on Colin?Absolutely!!In truth, I loved both characters. Oliva\'s ""luck"" was cringe-worthy and I felt sorry for her. I also was laughing while reading Mr. Wrong Number many many times. I thought it was delightful! I read the book in one sitting and the pages just flew away.I also recommend not reading the blurb which in my opinion gives way too much information. I didn\'t read it, so I was extra happy.Thank you, Berkley and NetGalley, for my free copy in exchange for my honest review.Cliffhanger: No5/5 FangsMrsLeif\'s Two Fangs About It|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""I liked the premise, but there were too many wtf moments for me to stay invested in the story.Please indulge me as I rant out my feelings on this one.Things had a tendency to get very campy and gave off prime-time CBS sitcom vibes.Example: The main character burned her apartment building down when she got attacked by a possum while torching love letters on a balcony, and there were no financial or criminal consequences for her.It makes sense that this was the author's first adult novel because the main characters acted pretty juvenile despite their ages.Olivia was so clumsy, inconsiderate, and made such poor decisions that one would think she might have an undiagnosed medical condition. That is the only reason I can think that someone who weeks earlier made herself homeless with the aforementioned possum fire, would then leave a pot of sauce simmering on the stove at her brother's apartment while she left to run errands.Colin is marginally better. He should have just told Olivia as soon as he figured out it was her that he'd been texting. I realized he too was a lost cause much later when, instead of telling the truth, he went and roped in a coworker to pretend to be the person Olivia had been texting. What kind of dumb Two Broke Girls style antic is that?There were a few other smaller things that bugged me too.Why didn't Olivia have any friends? Why was her only friend an acquaintance she hadn't talked to since high school? Did people stop associating with her because she thought replacing a stainless steel colander with a cheap plastic one was appropriate?Why didn't anyone buy her normal clothes after the fire so she didn't have to wear her high school clothes to job interviews? Like her sister-in-law couldn't lend her anything? It seems like there were several ways to resolve this lack of clothes problem and the author went with the most nonsensical one just to make Olivia uncomfortable around Colin.Everything that had to do with alcohol felt like it was written by someone who doesn't drink. A half a bottle of wine for a three-person spaghetti dinner? 4 people had leftover bottles from a 12 pack that lasted the rest of the week? I'm not saying get trashed, but who drinks that little.I have never been to Omaha. So maybe things work differently there. Perhaps in Omaha, a single newspaper column will get billboards and commercials, though I don't think even Dear Abby got that kind of advertisement when print media was relevant.It was easy to ignore some of the silliness at the beginning of the book when the story was enjoyable, but things just kept getting more and more absurd.While this book was not my cup of tea, I would definitely recommend it to someone who enjoyed the later seasons of Once Upon a Time or felt that Ross Gellar was a good romantic partner.This should probably be a one star review, but I added an additional star because of the single mention of Nick Miller from New Girl.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Mr. Wrong Book 4 MeOlivia does not deserve Collin I will take him from her.Let's play a game, I like to call it 'if I had a penny every time....'Every time......Olivia tripped over nothingOliva knocked something overOlivia made a messOlivia made me want to screamOliva made me laughCollin made me want to strangle himCollin made me laughCollin was an assholeCollin was a bad best friendI would be so rich I would be able to build myself a library.Seriously this book got on my nerves so much and I have a love/hate relationship with everyone in this book.

At the start, he was a grouchy asshole but I was like 'oh yeah he's the love interest he's gonna change' but Nah he didn't. In fact, he insulted Olivia so much that she was scared to hear what he thought sometimes. That's what I like to call TOXIC BEHAVIOUR. And not telling Olivia what she deserved to go was a real bad asshole move. Now I'm thinking about it I think I'm leaning towards not liking him too much while also loving him because he was nice......sometimes.

Ever get a wrong text? I got a picture of eggs once with the text saying ""let\'s hit this"" either the person was hungry or had a strange egg obsession. Either way, it was not as exciting as the texts sent in this book. They were fun and I loved the banter back and forth. I enjoyed all the characters, and I will even admit to spitting out my drink at the part where she mentions the image of being catapulted off the air mattress when someone sits down on it, because:a. if you have ever slept on an air mattress on the floor you know how they suckb. you have ever had the misfortune of being on one when someone gets off or on them.c. if you have the sense of humor of a middle schooler (me) you will find this insanely funny.But I digress, Mr. Wrong Number and Ms. Misdial are funny, they are witty, they are sexy, they talk the talk, but can they walk the walk (which is a lame euphemism for you-know-what)?You can\'t go wrong with this book!

Lynn Painter writes some of the only romance books I can truly love. her books, including this one, give me the exact same feeling that old romcoms give me and that’s exactly what I’m looking for in romance books. no big growling men in dire need of therapy and a girl so severely colorblind that red flags are green, just a nice story that’ll make you laugh, cry, and then laugh some more.this book follows Olivia and Colin! Colin is the best friend of Olivia’s big brother, and she’s currently staying in their apartment because… she burned hers down. so yeah, that pretty much sums up her character, her ex cheated and whilst burning his stuff, she had the misfortune of taking down the apartment complex too. Olivia gets a text from “Mr. Wrong Number” and they kind of just start chit chatting for a few chapters, but of course, Mr. Wrong Number is Colin. and she has no clue.but you know who DOES have a clue? Colin. after seeing a notification pop up on her phone.heeeeeres the catch, Colin and OliviaDO NOT LIKE EACH OTHERat all, and never have. so Colin decides that he should stop texting her yadda yadda, there’s more to it but that’d include spoilers and I’m not about that life 🤫 (yeah I am, I’m just lazy and tired)˚୨୧⋆｡˚ ⋆“I love you. I know I screwed everything up and I know we were going to keep it casual, but I somehow fell in love with you.

BUT she got over it!˚୨୧⋆｡˚ ⋆“I was totally in love with Colin.”Olivia╰┈➤ Liv was the definition of millennial, and I don’t care because I loved her. I think it’s almost impossible for me to dislike a Lynn Painter fmc, they might have unbearable qualities but that’s what makes them so likable to me. Liv is obnoxious and goofy, and I wouldn’t have it any other way. I adore her. I mean COME ON, she burned her apartment down while burning her ex’s stuff 😭 if that doesn’t sound like the dumbest but realest thing in the world then you’re just a liar, it could happen to anyone!!!Liv was a bit dramatic though, she was definitely more upset about certain things than she really should have been, but we’ve all been there. overreactions are a part of life!!🙈 but all is well, because in the end she realizes that her feelings mean more than a grudge.˚୨୧⋆｡˚ ⋆”I am completely lost without you in my life.”Colin & Olivia╰┈➤ ughh like I said earlier in the review, I needed more yearning to be a five star read. but I really did love these two, the texts were so hilarious and they match each others energy so well. I think Lynn Painter does a good job at making it feel like the conversation is really flowing between two people rather than just being some lines she cooked up in her noggin. I love it. outside of the texting, I liked their interactions a lot too. I especially liked how their interactions became a little different after Colin realized that Olivia was the girl he was texting, there was always some “ooooh I know something you don’t know!!” energy going on, but Liv never picked up on it. I also LOVE that Olivia and Colin actually fell for each other before they both knew they were texting each other. like, it wasn’t all of the sudden and forced, the relationship was built up between them.˚୨୧⋆｡˚ ⋆You aren’t a hot mess at all, Livvie.

I’m a girls girl but yeah I just couldn’t like her'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""This was fun but not as remotely outstanding as you all told me. What’s in Colin Beck that everyone finds so charming?Firstly, the story. It’s cute and kind of predictable, but if you're a fan of the big-brother’s-friend trope this’d do for you. I like how the texts were included in the narration and the dual povs at needed times.Also, I like the fact that he hadn't a crush on her before but fell in love because of the texts. I think it's significant in this trope to let the readers see the difference between Olivia the girl - a pain in the ass for Colin as much as for her brother, the classical little sister - and Olivia the woman - the adult she became.And this brings us to the characters.Olivia is the classical romantic heroine, a troublemaker to whom everybody is attracted like a magnet due to her good intentions. She's young and naive in a good way, but she's also annoying and impolite sometimes. I mean, who actually opens a new bottle of liquor when she's a guest in someone else house?Colin is, obviously, the opposite of her: too stiff, too cocky, too good-looking. He's nice with everyone but her because for some reason he finds it hilarious to be a bully and a jackass with her. I think the purpose of the author was to write some sort of knight with shiny armour, kind of rude and sarcastic but with a good heart. In her mind was probably a perfect idea, but I'm not sure if it worked on paper.On one thing I just know we all agree: both their families are horrible. Colin’s father is the classic guy who gets killed inCSIbut since he was such a bad person nobody’s sad, and his mother gets along with it because appearances are more important than everything else. And Olivia’s family is just as awful as his: Jack’s supposed to be mean but caring because he’s her older brother - and I don't know if his it's normal behaviour - but I’d have loved it if she had punched him; her father has no personality; finally, the only word I can use to describe her mother is “bitch”, and I waited for all book long for her to finally start shouting back at her mother but unfortunately it didn’t happen.So did I like it? Yes, but I need to read at least another book by Lynn Painter to make sure she's capable of writing about romance. As I said, it's a cute and funny story about two people who “unconventionally” fell in love, but there is no chemistry between them.Olivia and Colin can't apparently stand each other, then they start texting, having sex and end up together. But the excruciating passion, the uncontrollable feeling of even needing to be in the same room with the other person doesn't exist.Also, I’d like to say that not every romance story needs sex scenes. Kissing and then waking up the next day is totally enough if it's too difficult to write to them.↠3 stars""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4 starsThis is my second book by Lynn Painter and she does enemies to loversso well!

The podcast has gone viral, yet Pip insists her investigating days are behind her.But she will have to break that promise when someone she knows goes missing. Jamie Reynolds has disappeared, on the very same night the town hosted a memorial for the sixth-year anniversary of the deaths of Andie Bell and Sal Singh.The police won't do anything about it. And if they won't look for Jamie then Pip will, uncovering more of her town's dark secrets along the way... and this time everyone is listening. But will she find him before it's too late?","[{'rating': 5, 'content': ""FIVE FRANK-FREAKING-TASTIC, AMAZING STARS coming up!This series has truly educational purpose: especially last chapters of this book literally taught me how to speak Gibberish! I’m stunned, startled, speechless and numb. I loved the first book so much and as soon as I got my digital copy, I jumped up and down several times on the couch and broke it! ( Thankfully not my Ipad, I just broke my favorite couch! Shame on my over exaggerated excitement skills and too much sweet consumption during quarantine and chill times!)I was so happy to see Pip and Ravi back. After solving five years old cold case, acquitting Ravi’s brother Sal Singh’s honor and bringing justice for him and Andie Bell by finding the murderer, she was ready to talk and reach a bigger audiences about the progression of the events and her crime solving methods via podcast (thanks to Ravi, who named the podcast with series’ name)Now she’s sharing the details and interviews as Ravi resumes his court visits to pursue Max Hastings’ case who drug-rapped to many girls at the school including Nat who truly hates Pip right now because of being wrongly accused by her.When the life turns into its new normal routine and Pip promises herself not to get obsessed with any other case and live her life as a normal young adult (sweet 18 times!), attending the memorial of Sal and Andie, she finds herself dragged into Jamie Reynolds’ case: who is missing and his brother Connor who is also her high school friend needs her help to find him.Pip has no idea who 24 years old, outcast young man’s disappearance will bring out more terrifying secrets of town, fish netting online sites, secrets and Pip finds herself playing more dangerous game will bring her at the edge of tremendous breakdown because this time she took few more steps to the dark side and she may fall down from the cliff at any second. Even her loved ones and dear Ravi cannot help her this time.This was record time reading and at the beginning I thought the first book was a little better but when I reached to the last third, my mind was already blown away! My heart rate goes through the roof! I kept murmuring “Holly Sh*t” like a mantra several times and ending was epic, dazzling, dark, thought-provoking, volatile, phenomenal!Now I’m looking at the ceiling with a numb expression on my face and I can start screaming any time because the book is finished and I need more books of the series! I already missed the fast paced, nail biting, little hair lifter, excitingly delicious story telling. It’s addictive and I want more. I want it now. (Freddie Mercury’s song lyrics blaring in my ears!) I don’t know how I could wait for one more year! Give me patience Lord!I'm thanking myself and my husband's credit card for this copy! I bought it and I enjoyed every second of it. Highly recommended one of my favorite YA thrillers of the year!medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""I made a promise. . . . I said I would never do this again, never play the detective, never again lose myself.Pip has sworn off solving mysteries for good. Now she's just following the trials from her one and only bout of sleuthing and updating her podcast with all the latest developments. But when a friend goes missing and the police refuses to do anything, Pip knows she'll have to step up again, even if it costs her everything.Sometimes I read a book, and it so far exceeds my expectations that I wonder afterwards if maybe I'd hallucinated. That's how I felt about the first book in this series. It was young adult, yet it was so smart, sharp, gritty, and utterly unputdownable. Now that I've read book 2, I know it wasn't just a fluke because it yet again exceeded all my expectations.I'm one of those people who grew up reading Nancy Drew (and The Hardy Boys, of course, but Nancy was my main jam). And so I'm always on the lookout, hoping some new, smart, spunky teen detective would pick up the mantle and delight me once again. And I've found exactly that in Pip.One of my favorite things about this series is the way the investigation unfolds. Clues are collected and followed up, which then leads to the next set of steps and clues. It's all very logical. And the dossier format of interviews, articles, maps, notes, etc. is so masterfully done that it feels like I'm in the middle of a real investigation.Just a word of warning: this isn't one of those mystery series you can read in any order you'd like. This book contains crucial information on the resolution of book 1, something I'm very thankful for because I have absolutely terrible book-memory. But it means you must read the books in order or risk being completely spoiled.As I'm getting older, I've noticed that I'm slowly outgrowing YA, but this series still speaks to me. Its mysteries and the way they expose the darkness of human nature, but also its cleverness and resourcefulness through its teen detective, appeals to all ages.

It didn't quite capture me to the extent thatA Good Girl's Guidedid, but I think that's mostly attributable to first being introduced to Pippa in book one.In the initial book, I loved learning about her as a character. Meeting a girl who was willing to go outside of her comfort zone and risk everything in the name of truth and justice.Pippa definitely felt more mature in this novel, like an old friend. She still has that same fire inside her to discover the truth though. She's really a character you can get behind.The mystery was well-plotted and I absolutely adored the podcast elements incorporated throughout. Podcasts are definitely a popular plot device over the past couple of years and it felt very natural within this story.Holly Jackson has such a pleasing writing style. The setting, format and fantastic characters in these stories will keep me coming back for more as long as she keeps writing them.I cannot wait for the next book in the series!!!""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'this was fun! i enjoyed it just as much as the first book, but for different reasons.with‘a good girls guide to murder,’i really enjoyed how much it paid homage to the podcast, ‘serial.’ i could see countless similarities to the case itself, as well as the format. with this sequel, i had a lot of fun with the new storyline that didnt remind me of a true crime case in particular. if feels fresh and unique and is definitely a wild ride.i also appreciate how much more mellow this sequel is. yes, its fast paced, but it doesnt feel busy like the first book did. i swear,AGGGTMcontained every crime under the sun, so much so that it started to feel a little farfetched. this sequel doesnt go as overboard and i found that to be a big improvement.but the thing i found the most fascinating of all was the whole‘child brunswick’subplot. oh my gosh. im so bummed this only shows up right towards the very end because i totally could have read so much more about this aspect of the story. so interesting!overall, a great addition to the series and im really looking forward to picking up the next book because my girl pip is seriously going through it.↠4 stars'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Review in next YT vid'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'UWIELBIAM TĘ SERIĘ'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Oh wow I absolutely loved this one.A far better story and pacing compared to AGGGTM with lots of twists and turns that made me want to binge it which I would have if I had the time.I liked Ravi a lot and how he cares for Pip.

Para mi sorpresa,Desaparición para expertosmantiene el nivel o incluso lo supera en algunas cosas respecto al anterior.Y mis cielas, creo que la Holly Jackson no es de este planeta.Empezaré dejando claro que sí,esta novela es una continuación.Parece que es un caso independiente, pero oooooh,vais a flipar.Sí que lo es en su mayoría, pero continúa con tramas abiertas que se mantienen de la primera entrega, y hacia el final todo va encajando.¿Os acordáis de una escena random del primer libro donde pasa una tontería que se desecha porque no tenía sentido? ¿O que en el primer libro X personaje le dice a otro una frase sin más?Pues queridas,TODO TERMINA ENCAJANDO.No me puedo creer que la autora plante las semillas de algunos sucesos con tanta antelación.EnDesaparición para expertostenemos justamente lo que nos dice el título:una desaparición.En un primer momento la protagonista decide no actuar, porque los hechos del primer libro casi le cuestan la vida.¿Pero sabéis qué es lo que adoro de Pip? Que va con todo. Se la suda todo el mundo y va al 200% a resolver sus casos.Y eso es lo que vemos en esta continuación. Ya no le van a amedrentar y va a conseguir las respuestas.En este caso el misterio parece más sencillo durante gran parte del libro, perova habiendo detalles que comienzan a hacerlo peliagudo.Como lector, algunos de los giros y tramas que se van desarrollando puedes ir intuyendo hacia dónde van a tirar, pero no, la autora juega muchísimo contigo y todo se convierte en otra cosa mucho más grande, temible y llena de sorpresas.Qué bien encajado todo, y sobre todo, qué bien narrado.Porque esa es otra...Holly Jackson esmuybuena escritora.El primer libro tenía una calidad increíble, pero creo que mejora en esta segunda entrega. El personaje de Pip adquiere aún más -si cabe- profundidad, yel estilo es impoluto. La autora maneja de forma espectacular las dinámicas entre personajes y los diálogos.Son tan entretenidos y bien pensados, reflejando en todo momento cómo son los personajes.Además, estilísticamente, hay momentos más que interesantes hacia el final (¡que me han encantado!).Respecto a cómo esta novela está planteada desde el punto de vista de maquetación,si en el primero teníamos entrevistas, artículos de webs, comentarios y demás, en esta ocasión llegamos incluso a tener fotografías REALES de los objetos del caso, mapas + todo lo anterior.Es una experiencia leer estos libros, porque sientes realmente el caso entre las páginas y puedes incluso observar los detalles de las fotografías o calcular tú mismo las distancias recorridas por la gente en los mapas.Y si hablamos del final...Al principio no estaba muy convencido de que la cosa fuera hacia ese camino, pero finalmente, en cuanto vi que la autora había planteado estas tramas de una forma casi oculta en el primer libro me quedé de piedra. Además,el final de este libro no solo resuelve la desaparición, sino que nos deja elementos muy importantes para la continuación, que creo que va a ser un cambio definitivo para esta saga.Estoy deseando leer el tercero... ¡Esperemos que la editorial no tarde demasiado en traerlo a España!En definitiva:Desaparición para expertoses unthrillerespectacular, con una protagonista determinada e inteligente, con un caso que se convierte poco a poco en algo más grande de lo que aparenta en un principio,y que no deja de sorprender y te mantiene en vilo desde el primer momento. Honestamente,esta saga es de los mejores misterios que he leído.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""ˏˋ°•*⁀➷・❥・“𝓢𝓸𝓶𝓮 𝓹𝓮𝓸𝓹𝓵𝓮 𝓪𝓻𝓮 𝓹𝓻𝓮𝓽𝓽𝔂 𝓰𝓸𝓸𝓭 𝓪𝓽 𝓱𝓲𝓭𝓲𝓷𝓰 𝔀𝓱𝓸 𝓽𝓱𝓮𝔂 𝓻𝓮𝓪𝓵𝓵𝔂 𝓪𝓻𝓮.”・❥・ˏˋ°•*⁀➷🎯04/02/24There are no other lines to describe this book the best than the above💌 There is so much I want to say but I'll keep this review short as this has been a long overdue review (I'm definitely solulu for not posting this soon😃).

Honestly, I feel violated, Holly Jackson called me stupid in at least 17 languages. There were so many twists and turns and I guessed NONE OF THEM. Usually when reading thriller/mystery, I have SOME IDEAS, now I had none lol. I was just trying not to get a heart attack. Actually, I had this one theory that I almost posted... so happy I didn't because BOY WAS I WRONG. Thriller is usually one of my favorite genres, but an aspect that it doesn't usually excel in is PROTAGONISTS you will root for. Detectives are usually weird, unlikeable, you don't understand the way they think, and they change from book to book. Here, that's not the case. Pip is your average girl, very smart, but she's just like you and me, she loves mystery but she's trying to lead a peaceful life (obv not trying hard enough). But, problems keep finding her. I feel like this is a huge part of the charm of this series (such a bad sentence). This book wasn't short, but I ATE IT UP. And it kept me hooked. I can't recommend this series (and this book) enough. I think it can work for anyone, even if you don't typically read this genre. It starts as this silly little school project and turns in this big bad dark monster. BUT IT DOES GRADUALLY, so you get to learn about the darkness of the world WITH PIP. BEAUTIFULBEAUTIFUL. It's executed so well also, there are so many formats within this book, interviews, articles, podcast files, pictures of evidence material, THAT COURT DRAWING... I GASPED.THE PLOT Have you heard? Pip is (in)famous in her town now. She launched the very first (and she hopes only) season of her podcast... as Ravi named it AGGTM (A Good Girl's Guide to Murder). While wrapping up the story, she's trying to live a normal life. Until her friend's brother goes missing. Police won't listen to Jamie's frantic brother and mother. But who will take the case seriously? Yes, Pip will.CHARACTERS You don't have to read this part, it's just me raving about how much I love these two.RAVI - THE BEST MAN. The definition of golden retriever boyfriend material. He's so supportive and wonderful. I wish we got more of him and Pip in this one, BUT I get why he wasn't that prominent. Sal's case of course affected him more and he had to spend a lot of time in court.PIP - THIS BARBIE IS MY FAVORITE DETECTIVE. I was on okay terms with her in the first book, BUT I FELL IN LOVE WITH HER IN THIS ONE. She's smart, meticulous, determined, kind, the best girl. I love her with Ravi, but as and individual as well. Can't wait for the show, casting department slayed.THIS SECTION IS FOR HOLLY: RELEASE THE PIPRAVI DATE SCENE NOW, I'M UNDER YOUR BED!!!""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I'M IN SHOCK RIGHT NOW.Okay, this is my favorite mystery of all time. The suspense, the careful pacing, the twists (yes, with an s), the realistic character development. How can it possibly be any better?Review to come...""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Due to all the obstacles she had to face and her family\'s insistence, Pip quit her detective job. Her podcast also had gone viral. Nothing in the world will bring Pip back to do investigative work again.But sometimes, in some exceptional cases where our intervention is inevitably needed, we will be forced to change our decision. Pip faces such a situation in her life when Jamie Reynolds suddenly disappears. Pip\'s initial thought was that the police would do whatever was necessary. But when she finds out that she will have to take the initiative to solve this case, Pip decides to restart her podcast and rekindle her investigative brain.What happened to Jamie? Why did he disappear precisely on the very same night the town hosted a memorial for the sixth anniversary of the deaths of Andie Bell and Sal Singh? Holly Jackson will answer these questions in this book.This sequel starts off somewhat slowly after the exciting investigative journey of Pip in the first book. The narrative pace quickly picks up and turns out more exciting than in the first book, especially during the central part of this novel. Even though this book deals with a few mature themes, it is pretty exciting to read after the initial 50 pages. The youngsters who are fond of mystery series books by authors like Enid Blyton, Hardy Boys, etc., are in for a treat here. But sadly, the author fails to maintain that pace during the latter part of the book, and the ending won\'t satisfy all the readers. Still, it is a decent book to read, like the first book, if you love to read books dealing with mysterious plots.What I learned from this book1) What will you do if someone you love calls you a waste of space or SOL (Space Occupying Lesion)?These are the worst words that you can call your loved ones. But unfortunately, there are still people who treat their loved ones like this. It can be your father, your partner, your friends, your colleagues, your boss, or even your children. We can see all the devastating consequences that such behavior can bring to your life in this book.Labeling and put-downs by parents or teachers are said to be the worst way to treat children.It is said that labels not just stick for life, but for generations. So please be careful when you think about calling your children a dummy or whether they suck at maths or science. If you are a grown-up individual but still staying with your parents or siblings, like Jamie in this book, and they are trying to devalue you by saying that you are useless, the first thing you should do is find a new place to live. You should stay away from them and contact them only when it is necessary and give a strict warning when they try to demotivate you. It doesn\'t mean to avoid your loved ones totally. But it is still better to keep a safe distance until they start to recognize your efforts and acknowledge your hard work. You should take charge of your life. It will be easier for you to succeed if you are surrounded by positive people instead of negative people.Holly Jackson is doing an amazing job of making people understand the nasty side effects of parents\' mistreating their grown-up children. She also indirectly says that there might be a history of bad parenting behind almost every unsuccessful person, and the insults and name-calling won\'t end even when their children have grown up and become adults.""Dad said, \'You\'re a waste of space.\'""2) Who are the people that you should be careful about?It is not the serial killers or the extreme psychos who try to physically hurt everyone in front of them that you should spend all your energy to avoid in your life. These people are few in number, and the probability of meeting such a person in your life is very rare. It is those silent killers who have personality disorders, who are sociopaths who emotionally shatter you, that you should be more careful about. The problem with them is that they are more in number now, and it is pretty tricky for an ordinary individual to understand whether the people they are talking with belong to this category. It is because they are pretty good at hiding their predatory traits and are walking amongst us as ordinary human beings.""Some people are pretty good at hiding who they really are.""Proper education and life experiences will help us to find out these silent predators.3) How far will the predators go for manipulation in court?This is one of those questions that many of you might have asked yourself after the famous case of two celebrity defamation cases in the US court in 2022. The mainstream media and the whole world were so obsessed with this case that every action of both parties was closely scrutinized by the public. The way one person tried to mirror the actions and dressing style of the other raised a lot of controversial debates. It was widely interpreted after the public reveal of borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder by the psychologist that one celebrity was trying to manipulate everyone in the court, the opposite lawyer and his client, and even the judge.We can see how the author describes a similar situation in this book. (This book was published in 2020 before all these fiascos happened). Everything they used for manipulation, including expensive suits, fake glasses (fake glasses without any proper indication are always a red flag), and how they dressed, is well depicted by the author.""Yeah, that seems to be the image he and his lawyer have settled on. Expensive suit, fake glasses. Maybe they think his blonde, messy hair will be disarming to the jury or something.""My favourite three lines from this book""Hunches have to follow the evidence, that\'s how this works.""""What do you do when the things that are supposed to protect you, fail you like that.""""Everything\'s a clue until we discount it.""What could have been better?I believe that the latter half of this novel should have been dealt with in a better way by the author. The way the author introduced a different subplot after the twist in the latter half was a little unconvincing. Some of the readers might feel tricked by the author as she doesn\'t initially give sufficient clues that connect with the subplot after the twist reveal. That feeling will be greater, and the reader will feel forcefully pushed to a parallel new story if we do a retrospective analysis of the novel after we finish reading it.The whole vandalizing episode was dealt with extremely immaturely and casually compared to the rest of the book. Just because someone did something wrong doesn\'t give you the license to take the law into your hands and do anything to them and their relatives. Either the author should have avoided the whole vandalizing episode or dealt with its aftermath in a more mature manner.Rating4/5Despite all the negatives I mentioned above, this book will still be a decent choice for you if you loved reading the first book in this series.—————————————————————————You can also follow me onInstagram ID - Dasfill|YouTube Channel ID - Dasfill|YouTube Health Channel ID - Dasfill - Health|YouTube Malayalam Channel ID - Dasfill - Malayalam|Threads ID - Dasfill|Twitter ID - Dasfill1|Snapchat ID - Dasfill|Facebook ID - Dasfill|TikTok ID - Dasfill1'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': "": ̗̀➛4 stars☆“some people are pretty good at hiding who they really are.”god that ending really fucked me up. ngl i did get teary eyed and a few tears may or may not have escaped.And she checked, down inside herself, under her skin, but she couldn’t find it.

They just worked like that, teased out the best in each other, knowing when to talk and when to just be there.”confession:i started this book bc i wanted to see ravi again. they are constantly on my mind even after reading the books. they make my heart burst with joy because they were so beautifully written. this book delivered with all the scenes that he was in! the way they describe their interactions and how pip glowed anytime she was with ravi was so heartwarming to read about. i really need a ravi singh in my life. you’re telling me they said i love you in the rain and kissed?? i’m not going to be available for the foreseeable future bc i’ll be too busy crying about them.that being said, the small scenes where he played a bigger role than pip’s boyfriend broke my heart. the way he connected to the case and had hope were so saddening to hear about when the realization of what it means to him hits. it felt as though every presence he made in this book was deliberate and i loved him so much. the way he tried his best to be there for pip and put up with her outbursts while staying with her throughout it was so sweet. i’m never getting over themthe only flaw was that the friendships within this book were disappointing. the true colors were revealed within this book and even though i expected ant and lauren to be bitches, i did not expect connor to be so shy and a pushover. he was constantly annoying pip and never listened to her advice and i tried my best to sympathize with him but it became hard to. especially since he became sort of a constant character who helped pip along this journey. not to mention the way he wouldn’t stand up for himself when his friends accused them of lying yet he knew the truth?? he was probably the only downside to reading this book, along with max hastings. the only friendship i liked was pip and cara’s. they stayed good friends throughout the book and understood each other.this book was so funny at times. it felt like the perfect mix of everything combined into one which i loved. it would shift from funny to creepy and keep me on my toes all the same. the small banter was everything with pip and ravi and their small little ways of communicating were both adorable and hilarious at the same time. i hope they never lose their humor and their love. this book never lost my interest and i loved practically everything about this book.“I’m sorry. I feel guilty all the time, so I don’t need you to tell me. I’m the expert on my own mistakes. I understand.”“She hadn’t almost lost herself, maybe she’d actually been meeting herself for the very first time. And she was tired of feeling guilty about it. Tired of feeling shame about who she was.”“She wanted just to be the Pip she was with Ravi for a while. But that Pip wasn’t here right now. And maybe she really was gone.”“I think we all get to decide what good and bad and right and wrong mean to us, not what we’re told to accept. You did nothing wrong. Don’t beat yourself up for other people’s mistakes.”spoilers from this point on!pip went through so much in this book. it felt as though she’d never catch a break because as soon as she felt she understood who she was, something happens that completely changes her and she loses herself again. she deserves so much after everything and i’m still in disbelief after everything that she experienced. the scene between nat da silva and pip and how they cried together and bonded?? i found it to be so emotional and painful after everything that happened and how max hastings never got what he deserved. there’s something about the way holly jackson portrays the emotions of a character that really hits me.the ending was like an emotional roller coaster. it was like one plot twist after another and i started bawling at the ending. i thought that it was genius to build off something that happened in the first book and center around it. i shed so many tears for stanley and what he experienced bc he never wanted to be like his father but suffered the consequences and lost all his friends in the process. it was disappointing how no one realized he was just a kid and regretted his mistakes. i wish he had a better death scene. he was so kind and realizing the person he truly was was so saddening. the fact that they wrote“You were better”on stanley’s grave made me sob uncontrollably.honestly i did NOT expect charlie to be the catfish. the way he knew that pip messaged him through connor’s account? literal chills. it’s hard to sympathize with both stanley and charlie but i understand both sides. it was so sad how stanley accepted his fate and tried protecting pip when she tried to defend stanley. i hope charlie appears in the final book and we get to find out once and for all what will happen. it felt as though jamie only played a small part in everything that went down in this book. stanley turned out to be such a good character trying to live a normal life who was never really able to escape his past mistakes.i hope we find out more about max after everything. i’m so proud of pip for what she did and facing the consequences so he would face the consequences also. the way max smiled at pip and ravi when he spotted them?? it was so confusing but i’m glad ravi put him in his place. i hated him so much in this book for everything he’s made everyone suffer through and he has the audacity to post a photo celebrating after being found not guilty. it disgusts me that he gets to be free but i appreciate the realistic aspect of this.ˏˋ°•*⁀➷kill joy - 2.5 starsa good girl’s guide to murder - 4.25 starsgood girl, bad blood - 4.75 starsas good as dead - 4.5 starspre-reviewi’m still sobbing over that ending. rtc if i can ever pull myself together 🥲'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""2.75!❝I don't have to be likeable. Fuck likeable❞Alright, let’s talk about this book. I’m giving it a 2.75, and honestly, that’s me being generous because the characters did grow on me a little more this time. But the plot? Still weak. And in a thriller, plot is king.I stayed up all night reading this one (thanks to my girl Bruna for staying awake with me and indulging my wild conspiracy theories), and while I wanted to give it a lower score, I ended up sticking with 2.75 because, well... the characters saved it just a little. But here’s the thing: I guessed 60% of the plot, and it wasn’t fun. At all. And yeah, I blame myself for having “detective mode” permanently switched on, but still.➷**Where’s the Creepy Vibes?**This trilogy promised me chills, but I’m still waiting to get spooked. The second book? Just as bland as the first when it comes to scariness. Sure, this one leaned more into character development, which some people might vibe with, but for me?Plot >>> everything. If the story doesn’t slap, it’s a miss.The thing is, if you’re not the kind of person who reads thrillers with a magnifying glass and Sherlock Holmes-level deductions, the plot might work for you. But me? I can’t help it—I’m piecing everything together before the author even gets there.➷**The Theories I Got Right**From the vault of my Notes app, here’s a little flex session about my predictions:1. [Jamie’s gonna get involved in something sketchy]Duh. He was practically invisible in book one. ✅2. [Jamie’s being manipulated by someone shady online.]Called it. Low self-esteem + the internet = red flags. ✅3. [Max is gonna dodge jail time, but book 3 will focus on him.]First part? Yep. ✅Second part? TBD—I’m going into book 3 blind.4. [Child Brunswick = Stanley.]This one? Plsss it was So obvious. ✅Basically, I nailed it. But the downside? It totally ruined the suspense for me.➷**Character Rundown**Pippa: Okay, hear me out—Pip surprised me in this one. She’s still kind of predictable and plays into some repetitive tropes, but I feel like I’m growing up alongside her. She’s maturing emotionally and mentally, and I’m rooting for even more growth in book 3. She might just pull through as a solid character by the end.Ravi: Oh my god, this guy. Ravi is the MVP. The way he cares about Pip? The support, the teamwork, the fact that he’s always documenting stuff and showing up for her—it’s all so wholesome. They’re the couple you want to root for, and his “lift you up when you’re down” energy is everything.Stanley: This man needs an apology from the whole world. Like Sal, he carried guilt for something that wasn’t his fault, and it crushed him. The way Pip handled revealing the truth? A solid moment. He deserved that vindication, and my heart genuinely broke for him.➷**Final Thoughts**The character development was the only thing keeping this book afloat for me. The rest was just... meh. I really hope book 3 comes through with the vibes and delivers on all the tension and creepiness this trilogy promised but hasn’t quite delivered yet. Fingers crossed.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Actual Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐.5Tell me it didn't just end like that.... right???You've actually got to be kidding me.🤬😫Like endingGood Girl, Bad Bloodlike that and then expecting me toWAITuntil 2021??!!!As of now I am going to announce that I really hate seeing the digits2021. Come next year, I'll love it but until then... I absolutely despise seeing that year. (Haha well maybe I should be glad the release date isn't2022---->that would beintended torture)Better yet, lemme just steal the nearest time machine and go to a future where all the next book is already released.AHHHhhhhHHHHhhhhh I CAN'T DEAL WITH ALL THIS. SO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.EVEN THE LASTSENTENCEFREAKED ME OUT!!!! HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE??!!!The story picked up a few weeks afterA Good Girl's Guide to Murder. The day after the memorial of Sal and Andie is when new trouble starts—Connor Reynold's older brother, Jamie, has gone missing and the police aren't doing anything about it because he's an adult & that behavior is not unusual for him. Sooooo even though Pip before promised to never go back intoDetective Mode, she's going to have to break that promise to save Jamie—though this time, she says she'll be 'more careful'. Oh and also during the book, the trial for Max Hastings (How I despise him) is going on to prove whether he's guilty or not, but I mean it's super obvious what verdict should be-I love how Pip created her own podcast named after the title of the first book, AGGGTM. And Ravi was the one who came up with it LOL.‘OK . . .’ He chewed his lip and it made Pip’s stomach tighten. ‘So, something murder, or kill or dead. And you are Pip, who’s a student and a girl who’s good at . . . oh shit,’ he said suddenly, eyes widening. ‘I’ve got it!’‘What?’ she said.‘I’ve literally got it,’ he said, far too pleased with himself. ‘What is it?’‘A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder.’‘Noooo.’ Pip shook her head. ‘That’s bad, way too try- hard.’Of course Pip didn't like it, but she relented with the name anyways😌Speaking of Pip & Ravi, their relationship wasthebest. Though Ravi didn't appear as much as he did in the first book ('cause he had to attend Max's trial), he was super supportive whenever he was around Pip. Especially since Pip still had some trauma from the first book and was having a hard time dealing with what happened in Andie Bell's case. Ravi always tried to be there for her and not decide things for her. He understood her and never tried to be controlling.To sum it all up ----> Ravi is thesweetest🥺🥰And while Pip is trying to understand herself and all that's happened the past few months, Charlie (the new neighbor) gives like one of the best speeches I've ever heard that really helped Pip:‘Oh, justice exists,’ Charlie said, looking up at the rain. ‘Maybe not the kind that happens in police stations and courtrooms, but it does exist. And when you really think about it, those words – good and bad, right and wrong – they don’t really matter in the real world. Who gets to decide what they mean: those people who just got it wrong and let Max walk free? No,’ he shook his head. ‘I think we all get to decide what good and bad and right and wrong mean to us, not what we’re told to accept. You did nothing wrong. Don’t beat yourself up for other people’s mistakes.’Okay now that I've said that I don't think I can go on without giving away any spoilers soooo.......SPOILERS START HERE:You have been warned..............STANLEY.😭😭😭MAX.🤬🤬🤬CHARLIE.😫😨🤯THOSE 3 ARE THE ONES THAT KEEP ATTACKING MY THOUGHTS.First of all.....STANLEY FORBES (aka Child Brunswick)😭😭I'M SORRY STANLEY. I'M SO SORRY. I'm sorry forEVERdisliking you in the previous book. You just wanted a normal life after having your own father train you to assist him in murders EVEN THOUGH YOU WERE10 YEARS OLD. He literally had the worst childhood and people hate him and blame him for something he did when he was aKID.I mentioned hating Stanley and finding him suspicious BUT NO I WAS WRONG. THIS GUY DID NOT DESERVEDEATH😭HE DID NOT DESERVE TO BE SHOT TO DEATH BYSIX BULLETS.I'M SO SORRY STANLEY.😭😭WHY COULDN'TMAX FREAKING HASTINGSBE MURDERED??!! THIS GUY WAS CHARGED FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT/RAPE YET CAME OUT OF ALL OF THAT WITHOUT ASINGLE CHARGE.ISTG THE JURY IN THIS BOOK IS STUPID. YOU LEGIT HAVE VICTIMS OF MAX AND AVIDEO TAPING OF HIM ADMITTING ITYET YOU STILL RELEASE HIM?!?!^ Let that beMEdoing that toMAXexcept replace theNEWSPAPERwith aMETAL BAT:)If anyone should've died in this book, it should've beenMAX HASTINGS.Oh and remember how before the spoilers started, I was talking about how nice Charlie was?Yeah, well turns outHEwas the one behind all of this. (He didn't have Jamie --->that was Stanley (long story), BUT Charlie started all of this and was the catfish -Layla Mead)AND CHARLIE KILLED STANLEY.Although, I can understand why he was angry and killed Stanley (Charlie's sister was one of the victims of the Brunswick murders)he still shoudn't have killed Stanley.STANLEY WAS10WHEN ALL THESE MURDERS HAPPENED. IT WAS HIS FATHER'S FAULT,NOT STANLEY.Still, I actually don't hate Charlie.Oh no, I have all that hate towardsMax Freaking Hastings.🤬And then you have the book ending with Pip being even more traumatized then before since she literally watched someone (Stanley) die right in front of her. Oh Pip :(.....SPOILERS END HERE!!!One more thing before I end this:I'm like really, really,reallypissed off at Ant and Lauren. They're supposed to be Pip's friends, but instead throughout the whole book you see them acting like complete jerks to the point where they thinkthis whole investigation is a JOKE??? They didn't even bother trying to help or anything—instead those two just keptgazing at each other, ignoring the whole world around them. Hope they get karma in the next book :))When Pip retaliated,I WAS CHEERING MY HEAD OFF(that sounds weird now that I think abt it lol). Even though she got suspended for 3 days, it was SO WORTH IT.Oh and Pip spray painting and breaking the windows of Max's house WASA M A Z I N G.I love this new Pip😍🤩In the next book, I better be seeing the revenge I'm waiting for.🔥🔥LET'S GOOOO PIP & RAVI|Blog|""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Simply put: Pip meets true crime4.5 starsSimilarly toAGGGTM,this took me on such a wild ride when things started unraveling as they did. The plot twists were real twisty and my mind was running in circles with the clues given and suspense taking place. Essentially once someone came into the picture, I just kept questioning, who tf were they?! It was making my brain hurt. although, I did manage to narrow down my suspects and ended up being right about them and wasn’t mad at it but otherwise still like 🫨Unlike the first book, the first 25% here felt fairly slower to me but it picked up immediately after. if I had the time and energy, I could’ve easily binged the last 75% with how well crafted it was all set up to be. I loved the addition ofthe podcastas it gave it a true crime feel besides the storyline. It also felt impossible not to draw the same connections as pip did—almost felt like our minds were threaded lol“But that wasn't it, was it? She hadn't almost lost herself, maybe she'd actually been meeting herself for the very first time. And she was tired of feeling guilty about it. Tired of feeling shame about who she was.”Aside from the mystery being entertaining, this book was also moreemotionally charged.Solving crime as an amateur detective clearly isn't easy as Pip had to handle the pressures and challenges that came with that(again, a suspension of disbelief is needed here even though the scenario is likely with how complex the CRJ system is)while also balancing her personal life. As a result, she was a bit reckless and a bit unhinged but to me she was trying her best to keep it together as she dealt with theInjustice of all that transpired.it was honestly kinda sad what happened in the middle and at the end.Reiterating this again but Pipravi? Love them 🥹 I wish we got more of Ravi but I did enjoy him riling up pip and the moments he was there for her. I fully believe we were robbed of more so i hope the adaption gives us that and i cannot wait to see what’s next for them both and seeing a certain someone getting what they deserveShout out to Jess for letting me spam her with my theories and gaslighting me in the process.“But the smile broke eventually, and Ravi drew back. You should have just asked me. I know exactly who you are.”“To all the girls who’ve ever been doubted or not believed. I know how that feels. These books are for all of you.” This dedication >""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""4.5 ☆🎧 ⋮I did something badthey say I did something badthen why’s it feel so good?most fun I’ve ever hadೃ⁀➷ my thoughts :this was even better than the first one! It’s a contemporary series, but it has all the depth and character development that I would expect from a high fantasy. The plot twists wereplot twisting, not to mention Pipravi were absolutely adorable!! I didn’t have super strong feelings towards ravi in book 1 but now I love him; he’s such a cinnamon roll 🥺 and someone needs to give pip a hug omg. This series deserves all the hype!

And I love her. I love you.”""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Never would I thought the series could get any better... but it does. Holly Jackson seems to outdo the first book and I am simply amazed (no, it is not possible). This is probably one of the best murder-mystery novels I've read in a long time and I'm so glad it failed to disappoint me (disclaimer: I've been disappointed a lot by the middle book syndrome). But Holly Jackson literally said: SIKE, YOU BET!The author managed to keep me guessing and stay for the truth. There were so many twists and turns that worked very well with the plot developments. I remember pointing out in the first book that all the clues felt rather coincidental and merely luck. However, Pippa truly proves herself over and over that she has what it takes to be a true investigator.This book offered another kind of format that is still well organized and written. Holly Jackson lured me back into Pip's story with a great opening line and a deftly constructed synopsis of the events of the last book. As the number of suspects expands and secrets, lies, and false identities are uncovered, the plot moves at a very fast pace. A total page-turner.And to see Pippa and Ravi again was my ultimate goal in continuing this. We get to see the romance without it taking away the overall suspenseful atmosphere of the book. It was just a bummer that Ravi's presence felt less significant in this one as it focuses more on Jamie (a brother to Pippa's friend). I don't mind me more Ravi (ノ^∇^)I was also definitely surprised with the revelation, despite the suspicion. And as much as I enjoyed it, it feels a bit underwhelming(probably because it involves new people in the town so I don't find myself feeling connected, considering a little establishment to the culprit's backstory as compared to the first book).Nevertheless, this is another success from Holly Jackson. Good Girl, Bad Blood is bewildering, intense and dark. I couldn't wait to start the last book (gonna miss Pippa, I just know).[4.5/5]""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""⭐2.5Ehhhhh I didn't care for it and I am so disappointed.I really loved A Good Girl's Guide to Murder and this had similar podcast/interview elements I enjoyed so much. But it lacked Pip's tenacity and grit. Pip felt washed out and bland. She depressed me to be honest. I know the character was tired but it felt overdone.The mystery of the missing brother was lackluster at best for the first 2/3's of the novel. Then the twists started coming and they didn't stop coming. And they were insane (I mean that in a bad way, if it wasn't obvious). Completely left field. Nothing anyone could have predicted or even imagined. I did not like the ending at all.I think this book is probably suffering from middle-book syndrome. It felt very episode-of-the-week.I am still interested in picking up the third book however. I have hope for this storyline.""}]"

The Wicked King (The Folk of the Air, #2)
",Holly Black,4.29,888596,1173,"Fantasy, Young Adult, Romance, Young Adult Fantasy, Fiction, Audiobook, Magic",336,08-01-2019,"The enchanting and bloodthirsty sequel to the New York Times bestselling novel The Cruel Prince.You must be strong enough to strike and strike and strike again without tiring.The first lesson is to make yourself strong.After the jaw-dropping revelation that Oak is the heir to Faerie, Jude must keep her brother safe. To do so, she has bound the wicked king, Cardan, to her, and made herself the power behind the throne. Navigating the constantly shifting political alliances of Faerie would be difficult enough if Cardan were easy to control. But he does everything in his power to humiliate and undermine her even as his fascination with her remains undiminished.When it becomes all too clear that someone close to Jude means to betray her, threatening her own life and the lives of everyone she loves, Jude must uncover the traitor and fight her own complicated feelings for Cardan to maintain control as a mortal in a Faerie world.","[{'rating': 5, 'content': ""1.)The Cruel Prince★★★★★1.5)The Lost Sisters★★★★★“Once upon a time, there was a human girl stolen away by faeries, and because of that, she swore to destroy them.”Many of you might not know this but on this day many years ago, Holly Black’s biggest fan was born. Spoiler: it’s me! And I figured what better way to celebrate my birthday than to finally post my review for my favorite book of the year! I read this back in May, and it doesn’t come out until January, but celebrating my love for this book and series on my birthday just felt right. Also, I’m just that extra, butThe Wicked Kingis perfection in every way.I love so many different kinds of books; fantasy, romance, young adult, new adult, adult, books with lyrical writing, books that are character driven, books with angsty relationships, books with soul crushing emotions, books that make me feel everything. And I’ve read a lot of books; over 800 according to Goodreads. Butevery time I pick up a Holly Black book, I feel like she wrote the book for me. And I mean that, because she writes exactly the kind of books that I want to read. Not just key elements or parts, she completely encompasses everything I love in literature. And if I could wish one thing for everyone who reads my reviews, I’d wish for you to find an author that makes you feel this way, too.The Wicked Kingis the second installment inThe Folk of the Airseries, the first being my favorite book of 2017,The Cruel Prince! And this book starts off five months after the heart wrenching events in book one. This review is going to be spoiler free, but I will be talking about some key elements that happened in the previous book! So,please do not read this review if you do not wish to be somewhat spoiled forThe Cruel Prince!“I want to tell you so many lies.”(The most breathtaking fanart byLoweana!)Okay, so basically a brief summary is that Jude is alone with the new High King of Faerie. Madoc and her parted on bad terms, Oak is in hiding with Vivi, Taryn is to be married to Locke, Balekin is locked up, and Cardan is*clutches pearls forever*the new king. Yet, he must listen to everything Jude says because of a trick she played on him, but all of us know how quickly a year can pass and things can change. Especially since the Queen of the Undersea, Orlagh, is thinking about breaking the treaty with the fae folk on land, since she isn’t too sure about the new ruler. And she plans to use her daughter, Nicasia, any way that she can to help secure her place of power in the fae realm. And all the courts are coming together to see if Cardan really can lead and protect them.“Power is much easier to acquire than it is to hold on to.”And everyone is plotting in this book, I swear. The phrase “twists and turns” doesn’t even begin to describe the events that happen in this book. The political intrigue is so strong in this book. You won’t know who or what to believe, and you surely won’t know who to trust. And all these storylines come together to create something so beautiful. This book was a wild ride from page one to the very last page. Actually, especially the very last page.And I know everyone has already made a very big deal about the end of this book, and they aren’t wrong. You all thoughtThe Cruel Princecliffhanger was bad? Oh, sweet summer children. And, obviously, I won’t spoil anything, but there are so many different ways to interpret what happened. I’m going to be vague, but when you love someone or something, you will protect it at all costs. Also, the juxtaposition from book one to book two? Probably the best thing I’ve ever read in my entire life.Okay, I’m going to do a little break down for some of the characters in this book. You know, just so I can gush, fangirl, and truly be the hot mess that this book proves that I am. Also,Roibenplays a huge role in this story, which was such a wonderful surprise and I really wanted to mention it!(My favorite fanart(s) byPhantomRin!)➽Jude Duarte- My heart, my true love, my icon, my queen. Jude is my favorite protagonist and I would honestly die for her. Like, all I want in this life is for Jude to he happy, healthy, loved, and know that she is deserving of that love.“I’ve wanted this and feared it, and now that it’s happening, I don’t know how I will ever want anything else.”➽Cardan Greenbriar- And Cardan is probably my favorite character in literature. There, I said it. Are you happy now? Also, this book has a minor scene that really led me to believe that Cardan is pan or bi and the scream I screamed upon reading. (I’m so sorry, neighbors, if you’re reading this!) I thought I was too old or just completely over the concept of “book boyfriends” until Cardan Greenbriar decided to be created.➽Nicasia- I’m not even going to waste my finger strength. Bitch, bye.➽Locke- Okay, say what you want, but Locke is like the greatest antagonist of all time. I am not sure I’ve ever loved to hate a character as much as I absolutely love to hate him. I also completely believe that he’s going to be the “big bad” of this series, eventually. The half-brother development is going to come into play.“I wish he hadn’t used me to test my sister’s love for him. I wish she hadn’t let him.”➽Taryn Duarte- Friends, I have a lot of feels. But I’m just going to say that I want few things in life as much as I want the novella,The Lost Sisters, that comes out October 2nd, 2018. I think it’s going to completely shatter everything we know about Taryn, and I’m ready for it.Oh, and in case I haven’t gushed enough, the romance in this series is my favorite romance of all-time. And like, I don’t say that lightly. I thought inThe Cruel Princethat it might have been because I just love fae stories so much. But while readingThe Wicked KingI realized that it’s just because this is the best enemies to lovers in the history of the trope. I mean, sex is great and all, but have you ever shipped Jude and Cardan more than any relationship you’ve ever personally been in? Because, same. I honestly don’t even know how I’m functioning, let alone sitting at my desk typing this review, after reading the Queen of Mirth scene. Seriously, Holly Black is a fae queen, none of us are deserving, and her words are magical.“You are my dearest punishment.”But this is also a book all about power, and the ugly things people are willing to do for it. Yet, it’s also about love, and all the beautiful, selfless, hopeful, hopeless, heartwarming, heartbreaking things we are willing to do for it. I honestly feel like the heart of this story is about sacrifice; the things we do for our family, our loved ones, and for ourselves. There is a lot of good on these pages. And I know this is a whimsical, magical book all about fae, but a lot of themes and messages carry over really beautifully.“It’s easy to put your own life on the line, isn’t it? To make peace with danger. But a strategist must sometimes risk others, even those we love.”I’m not sure I’ve ever been as happy reading a book as I’ve been readingThe Wicked King. Also, I seriously pretty much reread this while writing this review. Like, I opened my book back up to grab some quotes that I tabbed, and I seriously had to stop myself from consuming the whole entire story all over again. Without a doubt in my mind, I will read this again before release. It’s just that much of a masterpiece, in every single sense of the word.“He looks at me as though we share secrets, although we don’t. We don’t share anything.”Overall, this review doesn’t do this book or my feelings justice. I have no word combination for how much this book, this series, and this author means to me. Yet, if you peak inside my heart, you might see my loved ones, coffee, video games, tattoos,Frank Ocean, andThe Wicked Kingby Holly Black. Not only is this my favorite book of 2018, it’s one of my favorite things in life. And Cardan and Jude honestly have the best sexual tension in existence. I could read about them forever, with no pay off even, and I’d just ask for more.Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Tumblr|Youtube|TwitchContent and trigger warningsfor murder, death, bullying, abandonment, captivity, abuse, talk of past child abuse, and for violence in general.The quotes above were taken from an ARC and are subject to change upon publication.(Thank you so much,Diana.

And she learns that she likes it.She craves it.And she will do anything in her power to keep her position.“I’ve wanted this and feared it, and now that it’s happening, I don’t know how I will ever want anything else.”But, her once simple plan seems to be fraying.There are traitors all around,the sea is fighting the land,and Jude\'s life is threatened from every angle.It seems hopeless to fight something so vast. It seems ridiculous to believe we can win.The longer she holds High King under her thumb, the less she knows and the more attached she grows.What has changed? Is he different because I have forced him to be?...Or is he no different at all and I am only seeing what I want to see?Meanwhile, King Cardan hashis own plans and schemes- and he sets several in motion, and no amount of commands from Jude could possible stop them all.And among those devious plots is something decidedly...new. Something for which Jude had no plots or plans against.Something shocking and crazy.Something utterly insane""It seems I have a singular taste for women who threaten me.""The wicked High King seems to be changing into something...something wholly different.Kiss me until I am sick of it.No matter what happens, Jude must remain focused.

I cannot believe that it was this good.I havefallen in lovewith all of the characters twofold.Jude has matured wonderfully and her schemes are so intricate that all I can do is lean back and be impressed.Cardan, the Wicked King, isabsolutely wicked in the best way possible.I don\'t have enough words in the world to describe how in love I am with him.The way Jude and Cardan dance around each other actually made my heart race - I don\'t think I\'ve ever been this invested in a relationship before.Simply magical.Speaking of magic - wow! The world of Faerie a la Holly Black is (as always) absolutely stunning. I love, love, love the way sheweaves such a complicated web.I could read her world over and over and never be tired of it.The plot was fabulous, the way it slowly picked up speed and that ending -whew. I\'m still reeling. I cannot get over everything that happened. Couldn\'t tear my eyes away!Also, I have a theory about the end:The king said that Jude was banished until the crown pardons her...does anyone else think Holly Black is aiming for Jude to pardon herself? She does have a crown now...Simply put,Holly Black is Queen.Mortal girls do not become queens of Faerieland.YouTube|Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Facebook| Snapchat @miranda_reads'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""someone:why do you like this bookme, deep in an elaborate fantasy sequence in which Jude forces me onto a throne for her own selfish gain and is an ambitious bitch to me and treats me terribly but also we have a lot of sexual tension:uhhhhh well I just really like the plot twistsOkay but for real. I already talked a lot about why I lovedThe Cruel Prince, so I guess I’ll just give a quick summary: antiheroes, court intrigue, power plays, and a fish out of water in a world full of monsters - but this time, she’s determined to seize the same power. Andit’s badass.Jude… is so great. She's seriously becoming one of my favorite fictional characters of all time, and I don't really know how? Her narrative voice is so strong, shaping and characterizing the world around her. The strength of her voice perfectly counteracts the desperation we see within her to cling to power, to not give up the few gains she has made. She's sodelightfully unlikableand yet manages to gain audience sympathy at every moment.The side characters here are particularly great. I particularly like the relationship between the Bomb & the Roach; the backstory we got for them here was excellent. Vivi is as fantastic as ever, but I actuallylovewhat was done with her character [I’ll talk about this later].The Wicked Kingis also pushed up by a series of interesting villains; while I am emphatically not a Locke or Nicasia fan, Taryn is intriguing and I want more of her, and Madoc is always a delight. Oh, and then there’s Cardan, the Sort Of Love Interest, who I find both incredibly compelling and very dislikable.I think what I’m most fascinated about with this book is how it plays with the dynamic of humans wresting whatever power they can. The idea of fairies not understanding the stakes of their own world on the level that human characters do. Vivi, as someone who grew up a fairy, does not understand how Jude was affected by her childhood - she was never charmed, or manipulated, or forced to play the games that Jude was. And the dynamic between Cardan and Jude is perfect; Jude clinging to the little power she has over Cardan, and Cardan being under someone’s thumb, just one more time.I’m not sure how I felt about parts of the dynamic between Cardan and Jude; there’s a continuous lack of dictated consent in their interactions, which makes sense for the situation and is still bothersome. But also, I’m kind of obsessed with their relationship. They have so much sexual tension and it kills me. I cannotwaitto see where it goes.And also, guys, there were so many fucking plot twists I’m laughing. i have no idea how I even felt about the final twist but literally everything else was so fucking legit and I screamed about eight times reading this book.Basically, that was everything I liked aboutThe Cruel Prince, but like... more. Jude is seriously one of my favorite fictional characters ever and the plot twists killed me and I'm super into the romance. And in unrelated news I’m going into a coma now [@Holly you know what you did] and I'll see you all... next year.

(Before you ask - yes, my heart is made of ice and pain and suffering and knives.)

I eat YA bestsellers for breakfast.I didn’t even like the first book in this series!And yet...I kind of enjoyed reading this book?!I didn’t even mean to ever pick it up!If you put me in a library and tell me said library is closing in 45 minutes and also that after that it will be closed for at least two weeks (but really for the foreseeable future), things happen.I may, for example, pick up the sequel to a book I did not like, for some reason operating under the belief that I had intended to read it.Apparently, my reward for such stressful experiences is CONFUSION.I can’t even put into words why I didn’t hate this.I mean, I hate these characters.Jude is annoying (I did not care for Feyre at all, and while she is not Feyre levels of nightmare material, she does belong to the same Vaguely Badass With Very Few Other Traits character family).Cardan is just...simply the It’s Okay That I’m An Asshole Because I Have A Tragic Past trope, dialed allll the way up to abusive.Throw them together into a toxic yucky will-they-won’t-they romance and you should have a fail-proof recipe to make me hate a book.AND YET!!!Plus there were a million tiny little annoying things of the variety that tend to warrant a whole page in a seven-page rant review.Like any of the emotional reactions of any character, none of which make sense.Or so many of the things Jude does. Jude’s actions are nonsense to me. The girl wears a mask of her own face to a masquerade where she’s supposed to be disguised? She says she can’t think of the words to command Cardan when literally “I command you to ____” would do the trick? She’s a full-on idiot at some points and a war-planning master of strategy at others?I don’t get it.But, at the same time…I had so much fun reading this????At a certain point, I was like “I should get back to reading The Wicked King. I wonder why I’m so into reading it? It’s not like I like it....oh wait holy sh*t oh my god I like it. I’m ruined. My reputation is in shambles. I will be mocked in the side streets and back alleys of the online book community.”But even worse, that cliffhanger at the end...I didn’t even intend to read this book and then suddenly all I can think about is finishing the series????What is HAPPENING to me.Bottom line: A book so fun it’ll cause an identity crisis.That’s the Emma Guarantee (™).----------pre-reviewso, to recap:- i hate these characters- i'm not a fan of the writing- many parts of this made me roll my eyesbut...somehow...i enjoyed reading it????WHAT IS HAPPENING TO ME.review to come / 3 stars----------currently-reading updatesyes, i am reading this book.no, i did not like The Cruel Prince.we exist""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Update Jan 8, 2019: It\'s here!Power is so much easier to acquire than it is to hold on to.So I\'m officially ADDICTED.I can\'t say for sure what makes a good fantasy book for other people but, for me, these books are like crack.

I wish I was sorry.This book got me so good. The banter and sexual tension between Jude and Cardan had me on the edge of my seat, all googly-eyed like a schoolgirl with a crush. The political machinations, lying and backstabbing are all so damn thrilling.I saw literally nothing coming, though I don\'t know if that was the author\'s genius or just because I was too immersed in the story to play detective.I\'ll keep this vague for those who haven\'t readThe Cruel Princeyet. This book picks up where the last left off - Jude has negotiated herself into a position of power and she fully intends to exploit it. The dynamic between her and Cardan has to be the sexiest I have read in a very long time. I like that they are both powerful people, both a little morally-questionable, because it makes all the love/hate angst so much fun.

INTENSAS.De hecho, la primera mitad del libro me aburrió, pero ya entrando a la segunda mitad todo se pone buenísimo, plot twist tras plot twist.Ahora, Cardan y Jude.Jude: En el primer libro no me cayó muy bien, y en este también estaba teniendo problemas para empatizar con ella, PERO algo cambió y muy repentinamente (esto no fue poco a poco) ya me estaba encariñando con ella. Al final lloré de coraje por las injusticias cometidas hacia Jude. Creo que se merece felicidad. Y merece saber que merece ser feliz, porque no tiene idea.Cardan: Bye, me enamoré (?). Ni tanto, jajajaja. O sea, es que Cardan se me hacía un ser despreciable. Era cruel y simplemente cruel, y me desesperaba mucho. Pero en este segundo libro mostró un poco de bondad y de sus sentimientos, y con eso me ganó. Y es que me gusta que no sea el chico malo que en realidad es todo soft y amoroso, NO, Cardan de verdad es cruel, y le cuesta mostrar bondad, entonces, cuando lo hace, me cautiva. Es un personaje moralmente gris y puessss... quiero golpearlo de todos modos.Cardan y Jude como pareja: Me ganaron. Los shippeo. En el primer libro pensé que jamás podría llegar a shippearlos, pero con este ME CONVENCIERON. Lo que me frustra es que en verdad les cuesta ser sinceros y aceptar sus sentimientos, PERO SEÑORES, AHÍ HAY AMOR VERDADERO.Y pues el final chicos, solo puedo decir que a veces, el amor nos hace hacer hasta lo impensable por proteger a esa persona.

She’s revered as the “Queen of Faeries” for a reason – the dark folklore behind the world she has created has the power to disturb you and also enchant you. I’ve reach much of her work, butThe Wicked Kingimpressed me in a new way. Holly’s prose is so delicate yet forceful. I was captivated throughout the entire novel by her writing alone. That, combined with an expansive magical universe and suspenseful plot made it one of the most notable fantasy books I’ve read in quite some time.I’m aware I’m the odd one out here, but Ido notcare for Jude & Cardan’s relationshipwhatsoever.They’re both incredibly complex characters with undeniable chemistry, but I just personally could not care less about a romance between them. I feel I’d view the book identically if they were archenemies, friends, or just strict allies. Personally, it’s just not what draws me in toThe Folk of the Air.What DOES draw me to the series is the plot and political intrigue. I’m woefully obsessed with Holly Black’s ability to create unique political tensions and guide a society through the brink of war. There were so many scenes strewn throughout the novel the had my “eyes glued to the page” (or rather, my ears glued to my headphones – the audiobook is super immersive!) I cannot get enough of the scheming, vengeance, and betrayal coming from every corner of story.ThoughThe Cruel PrinceandThe Wicked Kinghave shown to both be polarizing reads, I found the second installment to be equally as satisfying as the first.

I LIVED IN A STATE OF CONFUSION. WHICH, SURPRISE SURPRISE, MADE THE PLOT FEEL REALLY MESSY TO ME.her writing feels so overly verbose that i kept getting caught up on that and then consequently confused about what was actually happening, and resigning myself to just not caring about it. and i\'m aware that i, myself, write in a pretty ornate fashion, and i\'m hardly the biggest, greatest thinker ever, but i can conceptually understand other fantasy books completely fine.in terms of the characters, i can\'t say i really care about them either. there was a moment there, in the last 70 or so pages where i thought, ""oh, maybe they could be okay, maybe i could like this!"" but then it ended and i remembered why i didn\'t like anyone again.jude was no fun. though i enjoyed tcp, i didn\'t like her then and i don\'t like her now. to be frank, i think she\'s dumb, or at the very least, acts in dumb ways. i genuinely wish i had more to say about her but i don\'t. no more insults and no more compliments. she\'s just kind of... there. and she\'s the main character so that\'s a bit of a problem.i actually made a guess in my review for tcp that while i appreciated the immature, realistic characters, i would not once they got put in positions of power because that\'s when stupidity turns from funny and real to really annoying. and i was not wrong.the""politics""everyone loves in this one? girl. what politics. okay, technically, i guess it\'s politics, but i don\'t claim her, because a) i didn\'t understand it, so no i don\'tloveit, i don\'t even know what\'s going on. i don\'t know what day it is or who just died. get your""politics""out of here. and b) it doesn\'t feel like politics, it feels like children playing dress up. children that don\'t know what they\'re doing and DEFINITELY SHOULDN\'T BE DOING IT?? it\'s just a bunch of teenagers that need to be on a bunch of mood stabilizers.cardan. i liked him more this book. but not until the last, what, 3 pages? he got a personality transplant in the last handful of pages, but other than that he\'s justboring. really bland.of course i\'m happy that people have found another fictional boyfriend to make instagram reels about, i\'m really not here to rain on anyone\'s parade (continues to rain on said parade, sorry about that), but you all say you want a cardan, and i\'m like, do you? he\'s an alcoholic and has the emotional maturity of a twelve year old and somehow still isn\'t interesting.oh but actually, i did like some of his backstory that we learned, i thought that was interesting and appreciated that. maybe i did start to like him more after that bit.the romance. i swear i\'m sounding like a broken record to even my own ears, but WHAT ROMANCE?! this is not what i was promised. it\'s so random. every single time something happened i\'d go, ""oh, that came out of NOWHERE."" why?because they have no chemistry.didn\'t feel it in the first book, didn\'t feel it here.their entire love story is as follows: he bullies her for years (but that\'s okay because he\'stroubledand obsessed with her), then one day they randomly kiss, then another day a bit later they randomly fuck. that\'s it.and this is not because it’s ya, or more politics than romance, or whatever people say. i’ve read books with less romance that i enjoyed more. it’s not the quantity but the quality that i have an issue with.i did like it a bit later down the road, in those happy 70 pages, but not because it was natural, just because it got absolutely SHOVED down our throats once holly black decided to change jude\'s entire internal monologue so she\'s now horny all the time.taryn, i actually found interesting in book 1 and the 1.5 novella. now of course she disappeared for all of this book again, so there goes that. she might have betrayed jude again at the end too, and that\'s just mean. like girl go away.now, something i do feel strongly about: I HATE VIVI.

I hate it enough to wanna make 100 accounts to rate it one star over & over again.But I won’t, not because that’s immoral but becausethere can’t be hate unless there is love.There can’t be loss unless there is need. There can’t be hurt unless there is care.“I hate you,” I say, the words coming out like a caress. I say it again, over and over. A litany. An enchantment. A ward against what I really feel.So really, it’s my own damn fault.I all but handed Holly Black a gilded dagger, turned my back, and begged her toplease please stab me right in the feels, going so far as to give her directions to the place just south of my hopes and slightly north of my dreams.I am Jude and this book is myWicked King.And there is no better way, absolutely none, to convey how it feels to read its every page, every brush of ink, every curve and crease, than to quote the book itself:It has all the sinister pleasure of sneaking out of the house, all the revolting satisfaction of stealing. It reminds me of the moment before I slammed a blade through my hand, amazed at my own capacity for self-betrayal.(Please do excuse me for stealing lines—I do so because I am an inadequate piece of human soul and incapable of competing with the Faerie Queen who wrote this pure trove of gems).“Power is much easier to acquire than it is to hold on to.”I have said it before, and I’ll say it again: People don’t paint this series as it truly is.The Folk of the Airis not a light, romantic fairytale, however addictive; it’s a dark and deadly one—less a page-turner and more a temptress. It’s about tricks and snares, games and intrigue and pain and, above all else, power. Infectious, greedy, alluringpower.And that, all of that, weaves itself through every nook, around every thread of the books. It hugs Jude’s curves and flies from her lips, slides along Cardan’s tail and between his clever clasp. It wraps its hungry grasp around the characters, bathing, entombing, suffocating. And it, quite gloriously, circles the dynamics and bonds, twisting and blurring the lines of love and hate, want and fear, until it is one with its every angle, dip, and chip. I guess it makes sense some would mistake one for the other.Isak Danielson’s songPower(which you can find on mybook playlist) isThe Wicked Kingincarnate and why oh why didn’t I listen when people told me NOT to finish it before an exam and went ahead to do just that? Sigh, I’m a fool, yes, but a fool for Jude and Cardan. And that never ceases to be an honour.“Things are always super dramatic around here,” Vivi tells Heather. “Epic. Everyone acts as though they just stepped out of a murder ballad.”As I called this book apure trove of gems, I will proceed to refer to the treasures as the four most precious gemstones:Black Diamond:Jude Duarte“Once upon a time, there was a human girl stolen away by faeries, and because of that, she swore to destroy them.”I will fight every single person who dares call my Jude annoying or unbearable and anything else in the thesaurus for those adjectives. She is the definition of a brilliant badass queen and I am willing to rip throats to prove it. Metaphorically, of course.InThe Cruel Princeshe evolved from the girl who wanted to impress and fit in and fight for honour, to a ruthless, power-hungry, scheming star, and in this sequel her shine multiplies a thousandfold; so I suggest you all shield your eyes before you go blind from her magnificence.Exploring her hatred of vulnerability, her need for control, and her insistence on relentlessly pushing andpushingherself both physically and mentally to the brink of collapse until she’s achieved perfection and utter independence, made me relate to her on a level that bordered on discomfort, if comfort really had any meaning (at least to me) and I wasn’t such a self-absorbed bastard.The sheerwill. That, right there, is my most adored trait in human or faerie, reality or fiction.“You’re unwinding yourself like a spool. What happens when there’s no more thread?”“Then I spin more.”Anger or fear? Fear or anger?Jude would argue anger (unsurprisingly, that is, her being a furious hurricane and all) and I happen to agree. Both are overwhelming emotions that can drown and paralyse and turn one into a fool, while both can also motivate and embolden and turn one into a champion. However, there is a certain strand of arrogance interwoven with amger that fear happens to lack. And, you all know me, I would pick anger over fear any day.So I can do nothing less than shout my love for her from the rooftops, no mountains, asJude takes the hurt and weakness the Folk carved into her flesh and bone, adds it to the stew of her desire to be magic like them mixed with her obsessive knowledge of their rules and their ways and the music of their strings as they are pulled and plucked, and sprinkles it with a formidable amount of pleasure from the power and the dance and determination to learn and excel, watching it all bubble and burn.She is certainly my favourite cook, because she is better at being worse than them. Never, ever underestimate my little murderer’s strength, her skill at strategy, and her capacity for cruelty.Lastly, I want to raise a glass to the question Holly raises with this book:Is it good, or bad, for a ruler to contain those cutting, cunning impulses?Answer that as you will.Cat’s Eye Emerald:Cardan Greenbriar“Have you never heard that virtue is its own reward?” Cardan says pleasantly. “That’s because there’s no other reward in it.”Ahhhh, I am in love with this wicked king (while wanting to strangle him to death and back, ofc) and I’m not even sorry.I stand by my point in my review ofThe Cruel Princethat his most important difference from most wicked charming boys (or girls) in books, is hisabsolute lack of ambition.Hell, that’s also the main difference between him and Jude.This small (perhaps inconsequential to most fans) detail is so ridiculously highlighted for me because it makes him endearing and unique and helplessly adorable, adding to his irresistible charm as he languishes on life, andwhy am I swooning right now ugh.The Wicked Kingis undoubtedly the best installment in this trilogy and one of the reasons for that is Cardan’s beautiful, heart-stopping growth as a character. He goes from a person commited to, as Jude would put it, “being a layabout who does none of the real work of governance,” to finding himself, his resolve, mettle, fight—whatever you want to call it—because of how his feeling of powerlessness and fear trickle away, drip by drip, as he no longer has someone to inflame (Jude excluded). And, mostly, because of Jude pushing him unwittingly.He learns toownit.“The three of you have one solution to every problem. Murder. No key fits every lock.” Cardan gives us all a stern look, holding up a long-fingered hand with my stolen ruby ring still on one finger. “Someone tries to betray the High King, murder. Someone gives you a harsh look, murder. Someone disrespects you, murder. Someone ruins your laundry, murder.”I could go on for two more paragraphs about why he seems to “have a singular taste for women who threaten” him and why and how a certain type of power dynamic appeals to our dear twisted fearie as it, honestly, does to most of the messed up characters in this series, but I won’t bore you anymore with my psychological talk.I will just go ahead and carve a Cardan-shaped chamber deep in my cold, dark heart to trap this clever, cutting, shameless, straightforward yet playful boy and protect him at all costs.Burmese Ruby:The Jurdan Ship“If you’re the sickness, I suppose you can’t also be the cure.”I mean whoever wasn’t already abroad this ship should be careful because I might kindly push them overboard for being late to the party (let’s ignore the fact that I was also late to the general party shh).If book one was them warming up for the match, book two is them sparring at full swingand I am here for it.And “what is sparring but a game of strategy, played at speed?” So just as he is wary of her, bracing for her next blow while enjoying the game and trusting her completely, he is also going to land blows. Really, it’s only fair.“I have heard that for mortals, the feeling of falling in love is very like the feeling of fear. Your heart beats fast. Your senses are heightened. You grow light-headed, maybe even dizzy.”I think my second favourite aspect of their relationship (after the games and sparring match) is howtheir need and attraction and glimpse of a kindred spirit morphs into denial and fury and fiery hatred as they run away from the feeling they despise lacing through their love, all while being helpless to do so.Running at full speed on the tilted ground drenched with a rain of pain and desire, Cardan has already slipped. It’s Jude’s turn to do so.“Kiss me again,” he says, drunk and foolish. “Kiss me until I am sick of it.”Now, I’m going to make a confession. I was as stupefyingly petrified of their dynamic shifting as Jude was. Every step he took beyond her control, every claim he made to his own self, every fistful of power he dug up, I found myself screamingno nojust as much as I cheered his growth. Because I understand her fear of being out of control and powerless, and do not want him to hold more power than Jude. And that fear is idiotic and unfair, because the fact that one’s power should come out of another’s powerlessness needs to give everyone pause.He has capered while she schemed, it’s time for them to learn to be equals, with mutual trust even in their game of chess, having faith in the fact that their opponent and partner willnever land a killing blow.“For a moment,” he says, “I wondered if it wasn’t you shooting bolts at me.”I make a face at him. “And what made you decide it wasn’t?”He grins up at me. “They missed.”Violet Sapphire:Rest of the Rabble“Like the ant in the fable who labors in the dirt while the grasshopper sings the summer away.”“And has nothing left for winter,” I say.“I need for nothing,” he says, shaking his head, mock-mournful. “I am the Corn King, after all, to be sacrificed so little Oak can take my place in the spring.”✧Storytelling:I might’ve read only one trilogy byHolly Black, but I can safely say she is one true Weaver; taking the tale by the throat, dunking it in an ocean of vocabulary and punctuations, and threading the water and words into whorls of magic and enchantment. Thank you, Holly, for weaving waves of wailing tales for us.✧Worldbuilding:No words can capture and frame my love for this mystical, fairytaleish land of exotic, quiet allure, so I’m not even gonna try.“I’m still your father.”“You’re my father’s murderer,” I blurt out.“I can be both,” Madoc says, smiling, showing those teeth.✧Madoc:I could not tear my gaze away from this messed up father-daughter relationship. He, the monster who took everything from Jude, also gave her a new life, pushed her to her fullest potential (even while underestimating her), encouraged her fire (even while beating her down), was all is she had. And I lived for how thoroughly this facet of this dark tapestry, this theme of moving past and beyond the power of the person who raised you, burns throughout the book.P.S.Pain makes you strong? Sith much?“Your ridiculous family might be surprised to find that not everything is solved by murder,” Locke calls after me.“Wewouldbe surprised to find that,” I call back.✧Taryn the Betrayer:I argued in my review ofThe Lost Sistersthat Taryn likes the games and adventure and power play and is fierce enough to claim her own tale (while being hypocritical enough to deny it). And she does. But doesn’t mean she is not weak, because she is that, too. She escapes confrontation and discomfort like a sunflower constantly turning towards the sun to flee the darkness—and I’ve never much liked sunflowers. This adaptability is exactly what fascinates Locke, and this weakness is just what takes apart the trust between these two lost sisters.✧Locke the F***ing Fox:I know everyone hates and wants to kill this guy, but I can’t resist bringing him back to life after choking him for more of his playful, dangerous-but-fun fox games of backstabbing delight. *sheepish smile*“Revenge is sweet, but ice cream is sweeter.”✧Vivi the Humanlover:A moment’s appreciation for mt defiant yet chill, loving yet selfish knight-at-heart.✧Fala the Fool:Putting him here because NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE FOR THIS GEM WHY.

I could feel an increase of the pacing in the first book (which was packed with action), a pace that was a bit slowed down in this one, but it picked up towards the end.This book has fantastic action.“A king is a living symbol, a beating heart, a star upon which Elfhame’s future is written.”I started to dislike various characters of this book more than initially.Taryn was never one of my favourites, but her part in this book makes her look less in my eyes. Even though she seems disturbed herself, she is too naïve and easily manipulated by her absolute desires of normalcy. And she’s stubborn about them too.Vivi seemed totally great in the first book. I actually came to love her. But in this one, she’s definitely changed. Some of her certain actions do not represent her as they should and so, she’s no less amongst my own personal list of favourites of the book.Whom I really came to love though are the Roach and the Bomb. I thought at first that they were okay, but after this, OMG, I love them. Especially the Bomb. Like, she’s really cool and knows how to play everything off. And also SHE’S A MASTER OF EXPLOSIVES so she has a popping personality indeed.“The disturbing thing about Cardan is how well he plays the fool to disguise his own cleverness.”I’ve already said this but I am going to repeat myself: I AM IN LOVE WITH CARDAN.He’s still“The boy who still hoped he might be loved”. I love you, Cardan boy, don’t you worry that pretty head of yours.As the action goes on, I just can’t help but fall in love with him with every chapter. He’s just…such an amazing character that sometimes I feel like he’s the only one who’s been blessed with character depth (even though the characters' own emotional profiles seem to deepen in this book more than in the first one). Cardan just gets better and better and he surprised me with his cunning and wisdom more than once.“He is ridiculously beautiful as ever, mouth soft, lips slightly parted. Lashes so long that when his eyes are closed they rest against his cheek.”I can’t get over this portrait of Cardan exposed to us by Jude, who carefully examines the High King’s every move. She’s obviously and furiously in love with him, but aren’t we all? (At least some of us admit it though, unlike others *ahem* Jude)Their relationship is still weird. I have to say it. But I think that even this weirdness has its own uniqueness, its own interesting trait that I can’t let go of, but I can’t condemn either. It’s something wickedly interesting going on with this pair and I am kind of liking it.“I hate you so much that sometimes I can't think of anything else.”After this book, I still like Jude.Again, she’s a bit annoying sometimes, she is impulsive and tends to be rational until the verge of irrationality. But I am still fond of her. And I kind of understand everything she does because she’s just a mortal girl playing at high life. Even though she’s playing a dangerous and foreign game, she still doesn’t have to know all the moves. I am the type of person figuring things out while on my way of doing them so I am completely understanding Jude and all her discontinuity in life.I am a bit still not okay with the last 20 pages of the book though. It really made me very emotional and hurt and even though I hated it, I also loved the twist of it.It was such a good read and all I got left after reading this second book is the feeling of more. By this point, I think it is a bit hard not to love this whole plot. It’s truly fantastic.________________________________________Also see:#1.The Cruel Prince(⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)#3.The Queen of Nothing(⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Now that I have found in myself a taste for power, will I be loath to give it up?Jude finally has what she so desperately craves. Now she must do everything she can to hold onto it. But that is no easy task. How was she to know how much harder it is to keep power than it was to take it by force in the first place? After all, she is just a mere mortal in the world of Faerie.Ah, this series is just so darn satisfying! All the political intrigue and scheming and backstabbing I loved in the first book are back, and now there is even more deception afoot. Usually, all these machinations and power struggles aren't my thing. But it's absolutely riveting here, mostly because it's so clever and I never see it coming.Every character is as nasty as they were in the first book. It's one of the hallmarks of this series, and it really speaks to the author's ability. It must not be easy to write such morally corrupt characters, yet Holly Black makes them compelling and relatable. Even if I don't agree with their actions, they make sense to me. I understand why they must behave the way they do, so it makes them likable in their own way, even if they aren't inherently good.The writing is as sharp as ever, with witty barbs and putdowns traded on every page. It's hard to look away. Often, I would slow down to marvel at the dialogue and reread it a few times just to make sure I fully soaked it up.I have this fear when reading the middle book of a trilogy that it won't be as exciting as the first book (all that setup!) and the last book (the ultimate climax is here!). And this does start off a little bit slow. Not much really happens in the first two-thirds, though it was still an interesting read. Could this be the dreaded middle-book slump?But I needn't have worried. When we hit the last 100 pages, so much happens, one right after another. I thought I could foresee where it was all going, but I was just fooling myself. I was surprised, again and again. It was so thrilling, with a showstopping finish that perfectly sets up for the next book.I can't wait for book 3. I already know I'll be sad when this trilogy is over and I'll have to say goodbye.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:#1.The Cruel Prince~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'King: wickedWig: snatchedReview: to come'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3 stars Reread 2020GOODIES LINKWell, that was an ending!!Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""This.

The agonizing two year wait for the third book!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'The plot twist at the end of this book is singlehandedly responsible for all my trust issues'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Power is so much easier to acquire than it is to hold on to.I\'m not sure if I should be happy or angry?This book was, undoubtedly, my most anticipated book of the year. But I must confess, it did not quite live up to my expectations. That\'s not to say it is not a good book, it was just a tad slow for my taste. The book doesn\'t really pick up until about the 60% mark. After that though, things definitely get interesting.Main Characters\' Ranking:Jude = Cardan > Madoc = Vivi >> Locke >>>>>>>> TarynPreviously I disliked Taryn for being weak and complicit, but now I just loathe her for being a lousy, backstabbing, sorry excuse for a sister.The Relationships:Madoc & JudeEven though I know they\'ll never truly reconcile, some small part of me wishes they would because honestly a Madoc and Jude team-up would be epic. They would have all of Faerie bending to their will. No question.It is clear that despite her previous betrayal Madoc does still care about Jude and wants her to join his side.""Does our High King have any idea how good you are at running this kingdom for him?""""Keep hoping he doesn\'t""""Oh, I shall, daughter, much as I hope you will realize how much better it would be if you were to be running it for your own family.""But alas he is still who he is and any sort of personal feelings he may have fall second to his boundless ambition.Jude & TarynIf this series somehow ends with Jude easily forgiving Taryn for betraying her AGAIN. I will riot!Honestly, this is the reason I did not even bother to read The Lost Sisters. Because any amount of Taryn is too much Taryn for me. I do not care what anyone says about how she has her own way of coping or surviving in Faerie. Because the bottom line is both Jude and Taryn have suffered in this world their whole lives, but only ONE of them has betrayed the other. TARYN. Sure Jude may not have told Taryn her every plan and secret, but never once has Jude intentionally done something to harm Taryn. NOT ONCE. And just when she starts to let her sister back in, Taryn just slaps her in the face with another betrayal.Honestly, I am so done with this relationship. May it wither and die.Jude & CardanTo put it simply this relationship is a mess. A beautiful mess, but a mess nonetheless. Because once again we\'re forced to watch truly deeply damaged individuals fight their obviously growing feelings for one another because they lack the fundamental key to a healthy relationship, trust.On Jude\'s part:...that I like him better than I\'ve ever liked anyone and that of all the things he\'s ever done to me, making me like him so much is by far the most...and all I want to do is walk into his arms. I want to drown my worries in his embrace. I want him to say something totally unlike himself, about things being okay.Kill him before he makes you love himOn Cardan\'s part:""Kiss me again, he says, drunk and foolish. ""Kiss me until I am sick of it.""""If you\'re the sickness, I suppose you can\'t also be the cure.""""I wasn\'t kind Jude. Not to many people. Not to you. I wasn\'t sure if I wanted you or if I wanted you gone from my sigh so that I would stop feeling as I did, which made me even more unkind. But when you were gone-truly gone beneath the waves-I hated myself as I never have before.""These two have the makings of something beautifully tragic. And I suppose the ending of this book makes some people angry. Angry at Cardan. But personally, I found it fitting. A betrayal to answer a betrayal. An eye for an eye. It is the world they live in. The only way to win is to play, and it seems Cardan is finally done taking a backseat. So while I am disappointed our girl got played, I am not mad at Cardan for finally taking his life into his own hands. And that\'s the tea.Sidenote: one running theme I found quite amusing is how often people pointed out Jude\'s affinity for murder.For example:Locke-Jude""Your ridiculous family might be surprised to find that not everything is solved by murder.""""We would be surprised to find that.""Cardan-Jude-The Roach-The Bomb""The three of you have one solution to every problem. Murder. No key fits every lock.""""Someone tries to betray the High King, murder. Someone gives you a harsh look, murder. Someone disrespects you, murder. Someone ruins your laundry, murder.""All-in-all this was a mighty fine read and a great book to kick off my year.===NOTE: My Headcanon came true!!!Headcanon: Cardan and Jude will continue to have an unwanted, yet undeniable pull and attraction to one another. And one of those times will involve some fun with Cardan\'s tail.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '#1The Cruel Prince★★★★★#2The Wicked King★★★★★#3The Queen of Nothing★★★★★After the shocking turn of events that finished off The Cruel Prince, Jude is fighting with everything she’s got to keep the kingdom of Elfhame from falling to pieces under its new rulers. Unfortunately for Jude, not only is a war brewing in the Undersea, but the court is full of traitors—and a few of them might be in her own home.I lovedThe Cruel Prince,but I wasn’tone hundred percent soldon certain factors—yet, from the moment I finished reading it, I’ve been saying the same thing: “Everything I struggled with in book 1, Iknowwill be better in book 2.” Was I right? Let me put it this way: you know the “second book slump” people always refer to in trilogies? NOT AN ISSUE HERE. Everything thatThe Cruel Princedoes well,The Wicked KingdoesPERFECTLY.→ L I K E S :I’ve wanted this and feared it, and now that it’s happening, I don’t know how I will ever want anything else.First, without spoiling anything, let’s get this out of the way:the weird, hateful, hot-and-cold relationship between Jude and Cardanprogressesflawlessly, and by that I mean I cheered, I raged, I cried, I swooned, I blushed, I raged some more… it’s beautiful. I’ve never seen enemies-to-lovers done quite like this, because at all times, they’re kind of…both?Let me tell you, the phrase “I hate you” has never been this sexy.My body has acclimated, and now it craves what it should revile.And Jude, my gods,JUDE.She is amasterpiece.I love her so much. She’s coldhearted, cruel, murderous, backstabbing, and a total antihero in all the best ways. She’s earned herself a permanent place on my favorite “terrifying leading ladies I love” list. She’s also so clever and strong; despite being betrayed at every possible turn, she manages to constantly work things to her favor—or, at the very least, to take someone else down with her as brilliantly as possible.“The last room Cardan occupied caught fire. Let me rephrase. It caught fire becausehe lit it on fire.”Also, Holly Black’s writing is just legitimately sofunny, I can’t even describe. It’s incredibly rare that a book makes me laugh out loud, but I cracked up over so many weird and ridiculous moments—usually pertaining to Cardan’s absolute lack of any common decency and/or sense.Angry was better than being scared. Better than remembering she was a mortal among monsters.Finally, of course, there’s the world. I adore Holly’s commitment to writing a version of Faerieland that follows legitimate fae lore, and just like in the first book, that authenticity comes through effortlessly. All the world-building and political complexity she offered in the first book paid off so well in this sequel.→ D I S L I K E S :That I like him better than I’ve ever liked anyone and that of all the things he’s ever done to me, making me like him so much is by far the worst.Literally theonlything I didn’t like aboutThe Wicked Kingis the fact that I have over a year to wait before finding out what the hell is going on with this terrible, infuriating,pricelesscliffhanger ending. I mean, take the way Jude feels about Cardan, and that’s basically me towards Holly Black right now, except replace the “burning carnal desire” with “desperate need to find out how it all ends, right NOW”.→ F I N A L THOUGHTS :In all seriousness,The Wicked Kingwas literal perfection in my eyes and I would not change a single thing. I flew through it, I loved every page, I highlighted so many quotes I can’t even fit a quarter of them in this review, and I don’t know if I have ever felt so simultaneously torn andobsessedwith any pairing as I am over Jude and Cardan.Oh, and one more thing:TARYN STILL AIN’T SHIT.→ RECOMMENDING TO… :Everyone. Just… literally everyone.All quotes come from an advance copy and may not match the final release. Thank you so much to a very sweet (and unnamed) friend for loaning me their ARC!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Somebody bring me my dancing shoes! My favorite book of the trilogy winner of Goodreads Choice Awards!!!! Cardan and Jude, my favorite flawed, cunning, amazing characters! I think I should reread this trilogy sooner! Yayyyy!!!!COME ON! My cheeks hurt so bad! This book slapped me so hard! I didn’t see that final twist coming and feel like they pulled out the rug from under me! I’m sitting on the floor and screaming, taking few sips of my Kendall-Jackson Grande Reserve to cool down (it doesn’t work, I’m still so pissed off!) then I’m screaming again , taking longer sip, oh no, the bottle is already empty and the book is finished with a WTH I just read kind of final! What’s gonna happen next, I need my fix urgently! I’m addictive to those malicious, smart couple!I wanted to call this series GOF (Game of Faeries) because this sequel is sooo much better than the first one and it’s full of twists, surprises, conspiracy theories, betrayals, deceiving tricks.We have real intelligent, ambitious, rough, bitchy, manipulating, cool, dangerous, merciless heroine ( All hail the Wicked Queen Hey Jude, don’t make it bad, take a sad song and make it better!) and malicious, also delicious, backstabber charming evil hero a.k.a. once upon a time a cruel prince and now he is wicked king Cardan! I hate him! I love him and I love to hate him and I hate to love him kind of complex feelings invaded my mind!It is impossible not to fall for their chemistry. They’re match made in hell and their negative attributes perfectly fit with the progression of the story.I’m not gonna talk about twists and turns, giving you spoilers and ruining your excitement. I can only suggest you to READ, READ AND READ THIS BOOK!By the way: Here are my nominees for traditional 1st (see it only became well known contest, it doesn’t have to be organized for long years) Slapping reads contest:Locke: I wanted to visualize him as Tom Hardy ( not for my obsession of this charming British uber talented actor, I love his movie “Locke” so my mind already categorized him as book character!) but after the first book and Wicked King, I think I can easily visualize him as Sacha Baron Cohen and I could freely hate and punch him under his belly.Taryn: Nope, she broke my heart at the first book and I never forgive her, she deserves my mix of a few slaps and twenty punches package.Nicasia: Oh yes, this notorious, nasty, inglorious, shameless, scum… Okay I already arranged a kickboxing match between Rico Verhoeven ( My famous Dutch kickboxer)and her! He will take care of my revenge plans.As a summary: My malicious bastard husband hid my third book and I need to torture him to learn where he did put it but he threats me to blurt out the ending. Son of a greatest mother in law (she keeps stealing my wines and my CDs but she reminded me of my future self and I respect her!) gave me a spoiler that ending will be sooo surprising!So my dearest GR friends, this trilogy is easy, riveting, entertaining, fast pacing page-turner! I enjoyed the second book so much! I loved the characters! I enjoyed my torture scenarios about villanelles and villains! I highly recommend this series!As soon as I found the secret hiding place (I hope I don’t have to throw my husband from the window before learning the exact place!) I’m so much excited to read the final installment.'}]"
