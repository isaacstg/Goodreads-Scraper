Iron Flame (The Empyrean, #2)

No matter how hard I try, I cannot get this book out of my head, all because of those last 25 pages . . . \u2060How dare Rebecca do this to us, knowing we have to wait god knows how long for book 3. üò≠\u2060Did I enjoy it?Yes.\u2060Was it better than Fourth Wing?No.\u2060But will I continue the series?Abso-f*cking-lutely!\u2060This book is really hard for me to rate because while I enjoyed the story and the ending, there were a lot of technical (plot/character) issues that definitely hindered my overall enjoyment.*SPOILERS AHEAD*\u2060What I liked:\u2060The story is action-packed from start to finish, so you\'ll never want to put this book down.Iron Flame is divided into two parts. Part one takes place at Basgiath War College and part two focuses on the Revolution. There\'s 623 pages total, and I genuinely felt like I read two books because so much happens. I\'m glad I took detailed notes because I\'ve already forgotten a lot and I know I\'ll need to refer to them before starting book 3.The continued world-building is fascinating.Like I said, this story is non-stop and that includes uncovering new information about the history and politics of this world. We now have a solid idea on what\'s really happening on the continent, however, there\'s still so many unanswered questions about the past (before the unification), the venin, and the Empyrean. I love this phase of a long series because there\'s still so much we don\'t know or understand, and I can\'t wait to see everything unfold and come together in the next few books. \u2060These characters are some of my favorites and need to be protected at all costs.Violet is still a badass. Xaden is still daddy. Tairn is fucking hilarious. And Andarna is the sassiest bitch in the realm. I do wish she wasn\'t away for half the story though.Violet internally struggled a lot more in this book by bottling up her emotions, distancing herself from her friends, and taking on too much responsibility (like researching the wards).Violet is just as strong and determined as she was in Fourth Wing, but in Iron Flame, we see the toll everything takes on her. I\'m glad that by part two she starts to lean on her friends more, but I\'m worried how she\'s going to manage after the events at the end of book 2. There\'s only so much a person can take, and I fear Violet may break at some point in the future. I\'m looking forward to seeing how her character develops in the rest of the series.PS: Violet during the torture scenes and and final battle when she saves Sawyer was impressive as hell! I respect her so much and strive to be just as badass.Xaden is still top tier book boyfriend material.Look, he is not perfect. In fact, I\'m a little pissed at him for constantly putting the responsibility of sharing truths on Violet throughout this story when he could have easily been open and forthcoming. BUT I DON\'T CARE. That man is just so damn confident, intelligent, sexy and loyal to Violet, that the minute he\'s on the page, I lose my damn mind. And when he writes letters to Violet . . . I melted. He isn\'t even a romantic guy, but did one of the most romantic things in the world.There\'s also a lot of side characters (both old and new) that I enjoyed getting to know better:Rhi, Ridoc, Imogen, Bodhi, Mira, Brennan, Sawyer, Jesinia, Sloane, and Maren. There\'s also a bunch of characters I loathe and wanted to see die a slow and painful death. Some don\'t. Some do. *cough* Varrish *cough*. Fuck that guy. But I can\'t complain, because everyone likes a good villain and Iron Flame definitely had a few!PS: I don\'t hate Dain anymore.Obviously, what he did was absolutely horrible and I don\'t think I can ever truly forgive him for the role he played in Liam\'s death. BUT we have to remember, he didn\'t know what was going to happen and seems to be very repentant for it all. Do I trust him? Hell no. But do I think he\'s a bad guy? No. I still think he needs to redeem himself, so I\'ll be curious to see where his character goes from here.Those few chapters with imaginary Liam were everything.üò≠ Liam\'s death absolutely broke me and still haunts me to this day. So seeing him again, in the way that we did, gave me some closure. But this entire situation has me wondering (THEORY AHEAD), what if Violet\'s second signent is her talking to the dead?! We know a lot of history has been lost or written out of existence, so I\'m wondering if the only way Violet can find answers is through some power of communicating with the dead?RIP Mama Sorrengail.For all of Fourth Wing and most of Iron Flame, I hated her. And honestly, even after everything, I still don\'t like her very much. However, while I know she wasn\'t a great person or mom, I understand her choices. Again, I don\'t agree with them, but she really thought she was protecting her children. I wept when she died, not because I am sad she\'s dead, but for Brennan, Mira, and Violet. They now know that even if their mom was misguided, her intention was driven by the love of her children and now that she\'s gone, they\'ll mourn what was and what could have been. They each had such different responses and I felt them all.The ending . . .I mean, I\'ve already talked enough about it but DAMN, I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING. I predicted General Sorrengail would die but I thought maybe Violet would get taken by the Sage or something. So yeah, I am still completely shocked by that ending, maybe even a little pissed, and will be sending Rebecca Yarros my next therapy bill.What I didn\'t like:This is a small gripe, but why are they using the Julian Calendar in this fantasy world?I mean, Rebecca created a completely new world but couldn\'t come up with different names for the months of the year? Every time it mentioned December or July, it totally took me out of the story.\u2060The pacing was frantic and for what?So much happens, yet, at the same time, I didn\'t feel like a lot happened to push the overarching plot forward. The highlights are: Violet goes back to school, Violet tries to learn about wards, Violet gets tortured, Violet and half the college goes back to revolution headquarters, Xaden and Violet get the luminary, and then the final battle happens. We didn\'t need 600+ pages just to give us that. @listenwithbritt mentioned in an IG reel that the pacing felt like she was watching a TV series, and I totally agree. Every few chapters felt like a TV episode with some small task that needed to be accomplished or there was a hurdle to overcome; then it would get quickly resolved and they\'d move onto the next thing. There were a lot of small subplots that were unimportant and felt like filler scenes. So the constant bombardment of action, angst, or mystery was a bit overwhelming and it was hard to decipher at the time what scenes were really important for the overall story. For example, what real value did the survival class or the death hike scenes offer? In my opinion, not much but creating small moments of conflict to keep the story moving along. Maybe Rebecca wrote Iron Flame this way since the series is getting turned into a TV series by Amazon.The story was too dense.There were too many new names, history, and general knowledge to really keep track of what was important. And there were quite a few things that weren\'t fully explained or were overlooked. Pair that with the frantic pacing, and there wasn\'t enough time to fully digest all this new information before we were forced to move on to the next part of the story. I had to read slowly, re-read sections, and take notes to keep track of everything. Doing that for 16 hours was a bit overwhelming and exhausting.I HATED the other woman (OW) drama.It‚Äôs a tacky, cheap, and overdone romance conflict and totally unnecessary. There was also a big inconsistency surrounding it. First off, Bodhi mentions Cat early on by saying how Xaden has never cared so much about anyone, not even Cat, which alluded that at some point Xaden was involved with and potentially cared deeply for another woman. But later, Xaden says Cat could die for all he cares and he has never loved her. So why was Violet lead to believe he had feelings for another woman at some point? Solely to create drama between Xaden and Violet. And why didn‚Äôt Violet ask Xaden about Cat the minute she found out about her? If she did this, she wouldn‚Äôt have been blindsided by it all CHAPTERS LATER when they went to get the luminary from Cat‚Äôs family.Also, Xaden should have been transparent about Cat when it first came up so Violet didn\'t spend chapters feeling insecure. And the way Cat was a nasty bitch to Violet the entire book, but then randomly decides she\'s cool with her after Violet saves her life was so anticlimactic. This was probably the weakest sub-plot of the entire book. And if there\'s more OW or OM drama in the rest of the series, I will fucking riot. Xaden better not use Cat to drive Violet away in the next book.I was underwhelmed by the romance.Honestly, their relationship was stagnant because they didn\'t have enough time together in this book. With Xaden being away for most of the first part and then they end up doing their own things for the Revolution during the second part, there was little time for them to really grow deeper as a couple.I also expected more groveling by Xaden at the beginning, but instead he makes Violet responsible for his honesty by saying she has to be the one to ask questions and then he\'ll answer. But for the entire book, Violet doesn\'t ask him anything! So, she doesn\'t get any answers! Meanwhile, Xaden just sits around, not communicating with Violet, when he could easily take the initiative to share his truths. Their lack of communication was so frustrating and was definitely done to create drama for the story. It was dumb and lazy writing. They could have easily set aside time to really hash out the issues of their relationship and dive deep into the secrets Xaden is keeping, but they don\'t.The smut also didn\'t hit this time.For the size of this book and the fact Xaden and Violet are an already established relationship, I expected at least five sex scenes, but we got three. Okay, I\'ll admit, the throne scene was hot but only because of the setting. I wasn\'t excited by the dirty talk and, yeah, the smut was just lackluster in my opinion. It wasn\'t bad, just forgettable.It didn\'t feel like any character had enough time to go through any real development.I think this occurred because there were so many new characters introduced that the attention of the story was split. Or maybe it\'s also because the story is in Violet\'s POV and she pulled away from everyone, so since she wasn\'t as ingrained in their lives, she didn\'t notice changes/growth? I don\'t know, but I wish we could have had more time with Xaden, Rhi, and Sloane.There were a few things that didn\'t really get explained.For example, why wouldn\'t Brennan encourage Violet to do research on wards? Violet was trained as a Scribe and would be an excellent person to assign for this task. I get he didn\'t think they would have enough time to figure it out and he thought they should focus on making more weapons, but no one assigned Violet a mission, so why have her do nothing instead of possibly finding a solution to win the war? His logic wasn\'t full-proof. Also, the end where Brennan fixes the wardstone. . . we spent the entire book trying to understand wards and then figure out how to mend them and somehow Brennan does this but we don\'t see how? It better be explained in the next book and not glossed over. Also, why did Xaden become venin? In the dream he has, the Sage said it would save Violet from dying while she was draining herself for the wardstone, but I don\'t see how thats true. If you have any ideas please let me know. And random but can someone please make a timeline of when Xaden would have been able to have a relationship with Cat? Because according to my math, he would have been, like, 14 years old! There are even more situations that needed an explanation but I don\'t have the energy to go through them all.Overall, Iron Flame was a decent sequel. I enjoyed it. I was entertained. But it was messy, and left me wanting more and less at the same time. It should have been shorter, the plot should have been cleaned up a bit, and we should have spent more time with our favorite characters instead of being introduced to a shit ton of new characters (whom I\'m still not sure are important). It really is entertaining though, so if you enjoyed Fourth Wing, you\'ll probably enjoy this one, or at the very least, be able to push through it.

It starts where Fourth Wing left off and continues with Violet and co. going back to Basgiath College for their second year and act like mentors for the new first year students.üó°Ô∏èVIOLET SORRENGAIL(h) üó°Ô∏è‚ÄùViolence, remember it‚Äôs only the body that‚Äôs fragile. You are unbreakable.‚ÄùI love Violet so much, but I think she struggled a lot in this book with her position in this world and what her purpose is. Violet has the best intentions at heart, but feels like she is failing everyone and I just wanted to give her a hug this whole book üò≠\xa0when she said that she never failed anything in her life but now she keeps failing and making the wrong decisions I felt for her!!But Vi‚Äôs struggle were actually the part that made me love her more. Yes, she did make some questionable decisions in this book, but that‚Äôs what makes her character so realistic for me. She tries her best and sometimes her best isn‚Äôt enough, but this girlnevergives up. She will keep standing up no matter how many times she gets kicked down. She will find the solution to the problem no matter how many hours she will need to research, but she will do the work.That scene with her Varrish and Nolan and a certain other character whose name I can‚Äôt name killed me üò≠\xa0it was so painful to read.. Violet was so strong for enduring everything and not losing her mind completely.. I would have folded so quickly üåö\xa0Violet Sorrengail best girl. There is a reason she bonded not one, but two dragons. üíÖüîπXANDEN RIORSON(H) üîπ‚ÄúViolet.‚Äù His gaze rakes over my face, lingering on my cheeks. I love the way he says my name. Sure, it‚Äôs the alcohol overruling my logic, but I want to hear him say it again. ‚ÄúLieutenant Riorson.‚ÄùLIEUTENANT RIORSON Y‚ÄôALL. If you think WINGLEADER Xaden was hot wait til you get Xaden as a lieutenant that just hits differently üõê\xa0He was so hot in this book.Xaden has still so many secrets we don‚Äôt know about and I think there is still so much to his story. Like where did his mother disappear? I‚Äôm still so intrigued by his character and now even more after that ending‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt see that coming and I‚Äôm still shocked. I wish we would get more Xaden POVs in the books because the one at the end is never enough‚Ä¶ with that ending I hope that Xaden will be more of a focus in the next book, cause I just want to know more about him.üêâTAIRN & ANDARNA (DRAGONS)üêâ‚ÄúA rolling dismount would tear you limb from limb on impact,‚Äù he retorts.‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know that,‚Äù Andarna counters with what seems to be her new default form of conversation‚Äîtelling Tairn he‚Äôs wrong. A growl rumbles through Tairn‚Äôs chest, vibrating the saddle beneath me and the harness that holds Andarna to his chest.‚ÄúI‚Äôd watch it,‚Äù I tell her, biting back a smile. ‚ÄúHe might get tired and drop you.‚Äù‚ÄúHis pride would never allow it.‚Äù‚ÄúSays the dragon who spent twenty minutes refusing to put on her harness,‚Äù Tairn fires back.It would be a huge lie if I‚Äôd say I haven‚Äôt missed my sunshine princess Andarna in this book, because I did, but eventually all babies have to grow up and Andarna became a teenager ü•∫\xa0her angsty teenager attitude towards Tairn had me laughing my ass off. I love their relationship so much and they are the best father-daughter duo. Their bond is so precious! When Andarna said she wanted to be just like Tairn, because he is loyal, fierce and strong it made me so emotional üò≠üò≠\xa0And to my grumpy, firerce, strong and loyal dragon Tairn.. I can only say that I thought I couldn‚Äôt love him more after Fourth Wing, but I do now. The way Tairn protects Violet and stands by her side is everything. The relationship that the dragons have with their riders is *chef‚Äôs kiss*üßöTHE ROMANCEüßöI meant what I said on the parapet. Even when I‚Äôm not with you, there‚Äôs only youMy violetxaden heart was so happy!! I mean I knew Violet would be really stubborn about the Xaden lying to her thing and would hold it against him for quite some time, but I loved the angst that created. But Xaden is completely smitten with her and we love to see an obsessed boy. Vi doesn‚Äôt think that he would choose her over the revolution, but she doesn‚Äôt realized that Xaden would burn down the world for her üòå\xa0he is not like that rule-following loser Dain .. Xaden would break every rule for her and the way Xaden is so worried for Vi and wants to protect her has my heart melting into a puddle ü•∞Also can we talk about Xaden writing Violet letters while he is away?? that is so romantic and had me going ü•∫\xa0I only wished we could have read more of his letters and not only small excerps.

I hope this loser never finds a moment of peace.to the rest of the side characters: you were either irrelevant, i couldn‚Äôt remember you‚Äôre names or i refuse to remember to name, cause you going to die either way in this book or later.üëØ\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏èVIOLET & MIRA & BRENNANüëØ\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏èthe scene where Mira finds out that Brennan is alive and punches him in the face lives in my mind rent free. That‚Äôs my girl lmao cause I would react the same way if I‚Äôd find out one of my sibling pretended to be death for the last six years. I‚ÄôD BE LIVID.But it was great to see all Sorrengail siblings back together. I love seeing them all together and get a glimpse of their different dynamics with each other. When Mira and Brennan were fighting and Violet was just standing next to them and felt like their little sister again dksdskd üò≠\xa0I love them and they are all badasses in their own way.üîªWHY IRON FLAME WAS WEAKER THAN FOURTH WING IMOüîª‚Ü† if Fourth Wing was Catching Fire (The Hunger Games) then I‚Äôd say that Iron Flame is Mockingjay in terms of action and pace. As I mentioned abovethis book is much more slower paced. It‚Äôs one of those books where a lot happens, but at the same time nothing at all, because they are trying to establish the rebellion, gather their tropes, find out more information how to raise the wards etc. So it deals with the characters getting to class and learning about magic etc. While a lot of people still die in this book, Iron Flame just didn‚Äôt feel as high staked imo as Fourth Wing did. Violet and her friends survived all the trials and first year, so I didn‚Äôt feel like I was constantly on the edge of my seat not knowing what will happen next. Don‚Äôt get me wrong there were many scenes that HAD ME STRESSED OUT and sweating, because it was intense, but it wasn‚Äôt intense as a whole as Fourth Wing and didn‚Äôt me give me as much nostalgia as Fourth Wing did.‚Ü† theinfo-dumpingwas a bit much in this book. I think Fourth Wing had the perfect amount of world building and information. Iron Flame had a lot of information because the characters are going to class and learn about new magic and trying to gather info on how to raise wards and power the wardstone etc. and I get that it was important, but seeing them look for information, just to try it and fail and then having to continue their search was a bit exhausting.‚Ü† some of the themes in this book were repetitive. Since Violet and Xaden couldn‚Äôt see each other a lot in the first half of the book I ate up every scenes they had together, but the things they were fighting over were always the same.. Violet not being able to trust him, them not being able to proper communicate with each other, Violet complaining about Xaden lying and having too many secrets .. that was pretty much the root of every single fight they had. Their push and pull was a bit tiring to read at the beginning cause they had the same argument over and over again.CONCLUSIONFourth Wing was a perfect book for me and a 10 outta 10 so even though Iron Flame didn‚Äôt reach that level for me and had quite some flaws, it was still an enjoyable book to read and I love love love this world so much with the dragon and magic and harry potter vibes. I love this series and after that brutal ending I need the next book in my hands right now. Praying that we don‚Äôt have to wait a whole year for the next book to come out.P.S: What is the author going to write in the next THREE books?! We are already in the middle of fighting against the venin and wyvern and I hope RY doesn‚Äôt drag out the storyline too much and makes it another Zodiac Academy situation üíÄ‚îç‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ¬ª‚Ä¢¬ª ¬´‚Ä¢¬´‚îÅ‚îëTHE EMPYREAN SERIES#1 Fourth Wing ‚Äì\xa05 stars#2Iron Flame‚Äì\xa04 stars‚îï‚îÅ¬ª‚Ä¢¬ª ¬´‚Ä¢¬´‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îô'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '0/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è you thought Fourth Wing was bad‚Ä¶?

Brows are mentioned over a hundred times!!ü´† I have to laugh (or else I might scream) at the idea that THIS is accessible fantasy because not only is the plot and the world building convoluted and unengaging but the writing is so incredibly shit that it makes you reread half of the sentences over again if you want to the vaguest inkling of an idea of what is going on in this horseshit world. To call Iron Flame accessible spits in the face of twenty plus years of hard work and effort by truly talented authors to make fantasy books that are actually welcoming and accessible to a wide audience.Let‚Äôs actually talk about the plot. Fourth Wing was derivative and predictable and Iron Flame doesn‚Äôt even try to be any more.Here‚Äôs a list of some üåà‚ú®creativeüòç plot points Yarros used:- A shitty copycat version of the Hunger Game‚Äôs rebellion (with zero of the interesting nuance or intelligent discourse)üòØ- what is essentially a boring Umbridge at a half-assed attempt to create tensionüòß- The Rider Quadrant and the Infantry Quadrant finally interact!! They are dropped in the middle of a forest, are being hunted by dragons, and are given two maps and told to go to a location marked on the maps! A simple assignment for students at a war school who surely know how to navigate using a map because that‚Äôs an important skill for soldiers to know, right?! üó∫Ô∏è Not only do these riders not learn how to read a map until year two (WHY?) but apparently the Infantry and Riders hate each other so muchüò† that THEY DON‚ÄôT EVEN COMPARE THE TWO MAPS WHEN PEOPLE HAVE CONFLICTING IDEAS ABOUT WHERE THEY ARE. THEY WALK AROUND IN A FOREST FOR HOURS INSTEAD OF COLLABORATING ONCE. I don‚Äôt care how much you hate someone at school, if you are given a group assignment literally step one is compare all documents you have been given so you can be done as quickly as possible. ALSO WHEN ONE OF THE INFANTRY ASKS TO WHAT TO SO IN THE EVEN OF A DRAGON ATTACK THE RIDERS LAUGH AND MAKE FUN OF THEM FOR BEING SCARED??? THEN WHEN A DRAGON ATTACKS THE RIDERS ARE MAD AT THE INFANTRY FOR DOING THE WRONG THING AFTER THEY LITERALLY WERE NOT TOLD WHAT TO DO!! Yarros when I find you Yarros Yarros when I find you YarrosüèÉ\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏èüèÉ\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è- Jack Barlow back because I guess Yarros couldn‚Äôt come up with another new antagonist‚Ä¶ also he‚Äôs Venin for reasons. Really it‚Äôs not that interesting. The resurrection trope is so fun!!ü§©ü§ó- A torture scene summary that is not scary in the slightest because this book conditions you to know that Violet is never in any real danger despite trying to tell you she is always on the verge of death üò±- A visit to what is essentially the Summer Court in search the Book of some bullshit thing called a luminary (btw we don‚Äôt even know what it looks like until 60% through the book AFTER they‚Äôve acquired it???)ü§´- a catty ex-girlfriend (named Cat, wow ‚ú®creative‚ú®) making a reappearance and doing nothing but promotes wonderful stereotypes (even though Yarros tries really hard to tell you it doesn‚Äôt on page the literal page)üíÉüèª- and the most anticlimactic and boring battle with the dumbest ending I‚Äôve ever read!! ü§∫There are more stupid plot points, but I‚Äôm getting brain damage trying to remember the plot of this book so I‚Äôm just going to talk about things that made me wish I was attempting to consume whole boulders rather than read the most accessible fantasy book of all time: Iron Flame by Rebecca YarrosüòáVarrish. He‚Äôs our Umbridge lookalike. He strolls into the Dragon Rider Academy and he‚Äôs super scary with his one-eyed dragon Solas!!! üò∞I mean he would have been, but literally the first time he does anything scary by letting his dragon incinerate an entire squad, TAIRN FLYS IN AND THREATENS SOLAS. AND SOLAS AND VARRISH BOTH COWER BECAUSE TAIRN IS SO BIG AND SUPER SCARY AND THE üåà‚ú®‚≠êÔ∏èMoST PoWErFuL‚≠êÔ∏è‚ú®üåà DraGOnüòÄWell maybe this is understandable because Solas just killed like twenty people, right?ü§î But no! Tairn isn‚Äôt mad about that, he‚Äôs mad because Violet got like a first degree burn.I don‚Äôt know what Yarros was attempting to achieve with this scene but you know what it does achieve? It tells the reader that Varrish isn‚Äôt actually a scary villain because having Tairn put him in his place the moment he does a single villainous action. IT DESTROYS ALL TENSION YOU COULD HAVE HAD.üßçüèª\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏èAnd don‚Äôt you worry, dearest reader, this is a trend. LATER TAIRN MAKES VARRISH GET ON HIS KNEES AND APOLOGIZE TO VIOLET FOR BEING MEAN TO HER. ‚ÅâÔ∏è‚ÅâÔ∏èIN FACT ANYTIME ANYONE IS MEAN TO VIOLET THE ENTIRE WORLD COMES TO HER DEFENSE. Any character, any dragon, I swear to god a speck of dust could land on Violet wrong and the entire cast of characters would jump them. And it‚Äôs not just her friends. THE SIDE CHARACTERS, MAIN CHARACTERS, CHARACTERS WITH LITERALLY A SINGLE LINE OF DIALOGUE, MINOR AND MAIN ANTAGONISTS.THEY ALL COMPLIMENT VIOLETC O N S T A N T L Y.VARRISH COMPLIMENTS HER, THE VENIN COMPLIMENT HER, CAT COMPLIMENTS HER.Sloane (the sister of Liam, the stupid dead guyüë±üèª\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è that Violet tries to convince us was her friend) says the most benign of comments against Violet and Rhiannon and every other personality-devoid lampshade of a character in a seven mile vicinity practically threatens to jump this GRIEVING 20 year old girl.Characters that Violet doesn‚Äôt even know will compliment her out of the blue.THE BOOK READS LIKE AN INSECURE PERSON WISH FUFILLMENT. üíá\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏èIt‚Äôs so unbelievably unbearable. üëπThe Violet Defense Squad‚Ñ¢Ô∏è is literally in every chapter. My favorite part about this book was that I couldn‚Äôt find a chapter where Violet isn‚Äôt complimented for doing literally nothing in any of all 66 chapters of the entire book.ü§≠ü§©And in case you were concerned that anyone who was mean to Violet would get interesting character development, nope! They either end up dead or want to be her friend by the endü•∞ awesome!üòé Violet is my favorite characterüòçAre you interested in Violet‚Äôs character arc? Well let me tell you the wonderful highs of this perfect character that we‚Äôre supposed to root for and support!!üòòViolet starts out strong by making insane demands of Xaden like demanding he tell her literally everything even though she had her mind read last book! And she doesn‚Äôt just mention this once. She mentions this every single time we see Xaden. She doesn‚Äôt trust him, she tells us, but she loves him, she tells us. üôÑ They‚Äôre such a cute and believable and interesting couple ü•∞ü•∞ and their dynamic is made so much better by that random ex-girlfriend that was included because Yarros got bored I guess!üòçOn top of being annoying and insecure, Violet decided that this book she would also double down on being one the worst people imaginable! Remember when all those people Violet considered friends died in her first year and she was so sad about that?Well actually this book Violet tells us that she‚Äôs gained some new perspective!!ü§ØActually she‚Äôs glad all those people died because watching all those people die made her a better rider because they inspired her to‚Ä¶ not die(?)! Because that‚Äôs a normal and morally good thing for our main character that is SO empathetic and SO kind to say!üôà Violet is so good, I wish I was just like her!!!‚ò∫Ô∏èAlso remember Sloane and her dead brother?!üë±üèª\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è Well Liam spent all of book one writing letters to Sloane, his only living family! Wouldn‚Äôt it be so nice if Violet gave those to Sloane out of the kindness and goodness of her heart to help Sloane cope with the loss of her older brother?!üòä Well she didn‚Äôt!!Violet withheld the letters for weeks after Sloane arrived at the school, (weeks in which Sloane very well could have died by the way) and only offered to give Sloane the letters if she agreed to train with Imogen (a girl Sloane does not like) and only agreed to give her one letter a week!! There are over fifty letters Violet! What happens if Sloane dies during a freak accident which you KNOW are rampant at this death school???! Violet is such an empath guysü•∫ she really understands and cares for the people around her.üò£ Don‚Äôt you wish you were just like her?!üòÅViolet also does a variety of things such as:- Dropping a gryphon flier off the side of a cliff and then being surprised when said gryphon flier‚Äôs friends don‚Äôt like her? Inspirationalüí´- Talking shit on the infantry for not trusting dragons and being cowards after literally being a prime example as to why the infantry should not trust riders or their dragons! So empatheticü•∫- Wanting to murder Xaden‚Äôs ex for saying a couple of barely mean comments to her! A totally rational response!!!üëç- Trying to translate a journal from a dead language she doesn‚Äôt know (she does know many other dead languages, of course) instead of giving it to the girl that she‚Äôs knows understands that dead language! Wow! the smartest main character of our generation! ü§Ø- Accusing every scholar and student of the school of perpetuating misinformation and hiding history that she herself just found out about! She‚Äôs so kind and thoughtful ü•≥- Forgetting instantly about her friend who got her neck snapped after some assassin asked who Violet Sorrengail was. She cares so much about her friends!üëØ\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è- And many, many more abhorrent thingsü§©In case you forgot (because apparently Yarros did 90% of the book) Violet has EDS. Sometimes it‚Äôs brought up, but not really with any substance. And Violet just wraps her joints and ‚Äúpushes through it‚Äù and ‚Äúputs all her pain into a box‚Äù (??) and pretends she doesn‚Äôt have a problem at all. No further accommodations are granted to her in this book aside from the saddle from last book which is already dumb because everyone trying to hold onto a flying creature should be using saddles anyway.I highly suggest: Fly Or Die: The Ableist Narrative of Toxic Perseverance by Ella T Holmes for a much better explanation than I can provide as someone that doesn‚Äôt have EDS.Let‚Äôs talk about Xaden because if I have to think about how super special and powerful and amazing Violet is I might eat all the gravel in my backyard. Xaden‚Äôs depiction in this book is gross to say the least.Rebecca has confirmed that he‚Äôs a PoC which is great!Keeping that in mind, I love how he‚Äôs described as incapable of love and is called a monster and is untrustworthy!!üòçüòçAnd I absolutely adore that our super special and talented basic white girl Violet is the person that shows him true love and trust and is the only person who can take his mask of cruelty and violence off for the first time even though she‚Äôs so much smaller and weaker than big, strong, powerful Xaden. It‚Äôs so cool that all the other characters are so terrified of him and that he acts as little more than Violet‚Äôs big overprotective and jealous guard dog! I especially love that Violet‚Äôs mom practically tortured him and gave him a hundred and something scars and that he has to take responsibility for all of the marked ones!! That‚Äôs not concerning and horrific!!!! And I love that he also got another scar for ‚Äúclaiming‚Äù Violet!! that‚Äôs so attractive and romantic and good representation and not at all fetishizing men of color at all!!!ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ Thank you so much for your hard work Yarros!!!ü´°He‚Äôs also annoying and refuses to tell Violet anything unless she asks hyper specific questions. Their whole dynamic is just annoying and stupid.And I love all of Yarros‚Äô other characters who have less personality than paper bags with faces drawn on them!!ü™ë Frankly a folding chair has more charm than any of the characters in this book.They‚Äôre so unique and are definitely really funny and don‚Äôt ever bog down the scenes with so many characters that you can‚Äôt tell who is even talking anymore! They‚Äôre all unique and dynamic with character arcs!! Of course! What else would they be?üòÜAnd the dragons! üêâ Oh the dragons! How could I forget about the dragons that are nothing but glorified Uber rides!! They don‚Äôt do shit but posture and growl and be boring!Here‚Äôs some fun facts about dragons: dragons can choose their tail shape but they can‚Äôt choose their color which directly influences their personality and temperament!!All baby dragons are gold because that‚Äôs interesting! Is there an evolutionary reason for that or something? Not that we‚Äôre told of!More dragon sex is mentioned, thankfully we don‚Äôt have to live through the dragon-lust again though!Also the dismounts that Rebecca describes the Riders doing are literally physically impossible!! All the riders should be dead if they try to pull that shit! Giant flying dragons are not horses you can‚Äôt just walk around on it while it‚Äôs diving and jump off of itüò≠üò≠Oh and Anadarna also is now like a super special purple/chameleon never before seen breed of dragon with the rarest tail shape!üê≤ Are we surprised? No. Just bored. üò¥She also now has like a disabled/malformed wing. Her wings were fine in the first book, but now they‚Äôre not? Idk. I feel like that should have been a thing in book one but whatever. (Tairn literally blames it on Violet which is sort of hilariously fucked up??) But anyway she obviously can still fly because god forbid a disability ever hinder a character in anyway that makes them adapt, but she can‚Äôt ever hold a rider? Violet is like 90 pounds as we are so graciously reminded so I feel like if Andarna gets bigger she definitely should be able to carry her but whatever. ü§∑\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏èTLDR: the dragons are BORING. And they‚Äôre not even funny or cool or even scary. Why write about dragons if you make them boring and insignificant to the plot??! And Andarna is a special-special because of course she is. ü§™This review is getting way too long so let‚Äôs just talk about the ending.Oh no! Violet‚Äôs mom that got no real development or anything died! Anyway. üßêWhy the fuck did the revolution refuse to help Navarre? They claim to be morally superior and to care about the lives of civilians but just blatantly ignore like 50% of the continent‚Äôs population because they‚Äôre Navarre citizens? And we‚Äôre supposed to root for them? Right! Awesome! Okay!üòÜüëçWhat are the actual morals of the revolution? What is their end goal? Why did Violet join them so quickly without asking any questions??ü´†She‚Äôs so intelligent!ü§ìI‚Äôm completely fine with Xaden becoming Venin, though I doubt it will be resolved in an interesting way. Though I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really an interesting plot twist and I saw it coming a mile away after all the boring Venin info dumping I had to sit through, but at least it‚Äôs something.HOWEVER I CANNOT FORGIVE IT FOR MAKING THE FINAL LINES OF THE BOOK‚ÄúWelcome to our fucked-up family.

Hope for tomorrow. Hope for what could be. Hope that someone you've entrusted your everything to will cradle and protect it. And hope? That shit is harder to kill than a dragon.Well, fuckü•≤That being said, I promised myself I'd finish my current readings before starting this one, but FoMo was a bitch and then, would you believe that, I tripped and fell into Xadaddy's arms.Silly, clumsy me.Iron Flame was alright, but I'm not crazy about it.I found the writing even more YAish than it was in Fourth Wing and I, painfully, have to admit I feel the same about the romance.I don't know if maybe, when I first read Fourth Wing, I was in a place, mentally speaking, where my reader needs were more than met despite the flaws, but it seems like I can't overlook them with the sequel.Being completely honest, the plot does pick up after the first half and the romance has its up and downs all through the story, but it never reaches the point where I felt like giving up on it completely.The smut was fine and the tension well written, but I'm not a fan of Yarros's idea of spicy dialogues.The one liners, sometimes, made me cringe a little, and the characterization of the main characters left me a tad confused, at times, especially at the beginning. I couldn't follow the story properly because I felt like Violet was thinking one thing then acting in a completely opposite way.Speaking of Violet...When I read FW, I thought Yarros'd made her a bit of a Mary Sue, but that was okay, because she had obvious flaws, even she was aware of, to balance her randomly having every special skill on the menu and succeding in every single task she was burdened with.Iron Flame Violet is a total badass and she's definitely grown a lot, but she also feels a little incomplete and rough at the edges. I don't know if it's intentional and/or tied to her future evolution, but I wouldn't have minded her being more confident, especially when it comes to her relationship with Xaden.Xaden is still daddy, in case you're asking, and he was a total dreamboat, the ultimate book boyfriend from start to finish.Like I've mentioned before, I wasn't really sure about the romance, at first. I wanted more grovelling and Violet's constant thirsting over Xaden's fine behind gave me a headache. It gave me major early Tory/Darius vibes, and if you're a fan of Zodiac Academy, you'll get what I mean.Thankfully, things took a pleasant turn when I reached the second part and I wasn't only rooting for them, I was absolutely feral when everything mined their eventual happiness.This works for the plot as well. In the first half, I wasn't really enjoying myself and could count on one hand the moments I actually found interesting.But then shit hit the fan, twists started piling up and every page turned was an angsty fest I totally wanted to attend. I devoured the second half in hours and when I reached the end, just felt like staring at the wall.And have a mojito or two.I definitely didn't see THAT coming.Another thing I really appreciated, aside from the chef's kiss perfect action scenes and THE SASSY DRAGONS (omg my baby Andarna!!!), were the secondary characers. Violet and Xaden's friends deserve their own books - Rhi in particular <3<3<3< - and I definitely hope the sequels will focus on them more, especially because some characters are only now starting to blossom and they seem particularly interesting.I also would like to take advantage of this topic to admit I never really hated Dain. I'm pretty passive when it comes to him, but I swear to god, if RY takesthatdirection, I'm gonna throw a fit.Overall, this was, for me, a decent sequel, albeit an unnecessarily long one.If you loved FW but are having trouble with it like I did, I recommend pushing through it.All in all, it's pretty worth it.I'll leave under the spoiler tag some sort of disclaimer because, even though I usually try my best to stay clear of any kind of drama and hate brining real life politics into my bookish heaven, I've been harassed for a couple days both in public and in private because of my choice to give this book a chance, so for the first and last time in my permanence here on this site, I'll go out of my usual way and discuss things I usually never discuss on GR, after all.I'm aware of the controversy surrounding this author and this book series.I'm not ignoring the problem, I'm simply choosing to keep my thoughts on the matter private and my general beliefs silent, except for serious situations that require me to speak up about them out loud or environments where I know judgement or opposition would come in a respectful manner and not in the form of bullying and name calling.Unfortunately, that doesn't always seem to be the case here on GR, these days.I'm publicly choosing to read this book acknowledging what's going on behind the scenes, and my review will simply be that: an objective and honest book review like the hundreds I've written before, as my hobby and favorite pastime.It won't nor shouldn't be my opinion telling others what they can or can't, should or shouldn't read in their free time and how to use their money or to consume the media they purchased.If I had that type of influence, I most certainly wouldn't be spending my spare moments reviewing books for free.Iam choosing, for myself, to leave a review that has nothing to do with the person who wrote this book or her political views, and it's between me, my objectivity and my conscience to decide how this will play out.I don't need to state this, but before anyone starts throwing around terms and essays, my support and prayers go out to people who are suffering. I chose to do something about the delicate and important matters we're discussing (and those conflicts and natural catastrophes I rarely see discussed here, because, guess what? 1) it's GoodREADS not GoodWORLDWIDENEWS and 2) the world sucks everywhere and it's been sucking for a really long time), but you won't hear me being vocal about it, because I've learnt you don't have to boast about your actions and contributions to be a good person. That sometimes those who are lousy and loud with words, just like the idea of being good without really acting on it.I'm choosing to help whoever I feel needs helping in a way that's suited to my personal beliefs and that has nothing to do with the books I prefer to engage with.I'm choosing to remain neutral when it comes to sharing political views on a site dedicated to book tracking; war and death are a reality I'll never turn away from.And if separating art from the artist isn't a tolerated choice, I hope keeping my private life and my reader life separate will be more understandable.I hope those who disagree with my choice to refrain from sharing my political views, will give me the benefit of the doubt, as I'll try to do with them and their ideals.If you wanna talk politics or discuss what an author has or hasn't done, my comment section isn't the place. If you also wanna unfriend/unfollow me for this or because any of my reading/life choices make you uncomfortable, please go ahead. No hard feelings on my part, really. It'll be sad to see some I considered close friends go, but I understad.

The Dragons made this book better.The first 30% of this book is filled with \'You don\'t trust me enough\' drama between Xaden and Vi, which was seriously getting on my nerves.I get that she\'s hurt, but she was being absolutely ridiculous, demanding info while withholding it as a form of retaliation. Her inner monologue about being a \'bad friend\' and always \'feeling guilty\' for lying again and again was constantly on repeat. NO ACTION NOTHING NADA.

This freaking drama grated on my nerves, and I was tired of how much this phrase was used. LIKE STOP? Everybody knew that Xaden is not sharing everything just to protect her life, and to a certain extent, I understand Violet, and I agree with her.but she\'s being so immature and whiny, and I swear this book just kind of ruined her character in many ways because she was always back to this old topic, and they constantly fought each other, and Violet constantly defied Xaden again and again (as in risking her life) and then made up eventually.The author really tried to put angst into their story with smut, but tbh I DO NOT PREFER THEM AS A COUPLE (at least not rn). The love was too quick, and the amount of trust issues, insecurities, and fights they had was so wrong and unhealthy. Xaden was being protective of her and hiding truths from her for her OWN SAFETY! and saying from experience, fantasy girlies do not like overprotective bfs. AND ADDING CATRIONA IN IT? That was the worst!

This was incredibly disappointing...I don‚Äôt even really know where to start with this review, because I feel like I have so many complaints.First and foremost, let‚Äôs start with one of the book‚Äôs most glaring issues: the writing was genuinelybad. It‚Äôs as plain and simple as that. This whole thing dragged like crazy and I was just so bored most of the time. Not only that, the writing was also painfully shallow. Nothing and no one had depth: all of the characters were completely one-dimensional and the plot failed to be interesting or engaging in any way.Speaking of the characters, let‚Äôs go on with my complaints by talking about our failure of a main character. I don‚Äôt know what happened to Violet between this one and the previous book, but I don‚Äôt recognize her whatsoever. She used to be the perfect balance of kind and bad-ass with a clever and sharp mind to boot! But now this girl we all knew and loved disappeared completely and instead we got this whiny, insecure idiot without a single rational thought going on inside that annoying brain of hers. I suddenly couldn‚Äôt stand her anymore!Same goes for Xaden: he suffered from major character assassination as well. He used to be strong, smart, mysterious, intriguing, and swoony as hell, but that was all gone now. Xaden turned into the most flat character ever, and he had no depth whatsoever. He truly felt like a robot to me, and I lost all interest in him. He is gone for most of the book, and at first I really missed his presence, but after a while, I was just bored every time he came on page, because I knew he would be the same repetitive and annoying character he was during all his other scenes, so I kind of didn‚Äôt care anymore if he was gone or not.The fact that both Violet and Xaden turned into insufferable characters is probably a big reason as to why their romance was terrible in this book too. First of all, after the end of the first book Ineededto get some groveling from Xaden, but did we get that here? No. Not even for a second. Xaden wasn‚Äôt sorry, he wasn‚Äôt regretful, he wasn‚Äôt trying to earn back Violet‚Äôs trust. No. He didn‚Äôt do anything. He didn‚Äôt even fight for Violet to forgive him. He was just... waiting. Not lifting a single finger to get back the woman he supposedly loves. He was so cocky in knowing that Violet would crawl back to him anyway that he refused to do anything to speed up the process. He just waited. And I guess he was right, because our spine-less heroine did indeed take him back without getting anything in return: no promises, no trust. Just nothing.Which obviously leads to a very unhealthy relationship between them where they don‚Äôt trust each other and in which they refuse to communicate. EVER. All they do is be horny and have sex, but they never actually talk anymore. They don‚Äôt confide in each other and neither do they let themselves fully open up to the other. Their entire relationship was just shallow, boring and irritating. I no longer liked anything about it. And then we even got some goddamn other woman drama, and my patience just vanished! I hated it.Now, when it comes to the side characters I don‚Äôt even know where to begin, because I feel like none of them were written well or with any depth to them. It‚Äôs like the author could never seem to focus on more than a few characters at the same time, so whenever she wanted to pay attention to one side character, all the other side characters just fell away. For example: at the beginning of this book we have quite a lot of focus on Imogen, and I was really seeing some amazing progress between her and Violet. I thought I saw the start of a beautiful friendship forming between them. But then, the moment Rhiannon started coming back into the fold (after being ignored in the first part), Imogen completely fell away again and her relationship with Violet never picked up. It‚Äôs like the author couldn‚Äôt handle Violet having more than one close female friend; she couldn‚Äôt focus on both at the same time. And therefore, neither Imogen or Rhiannon ever truly felt like friends to Violet because they were often suddenly ignored in her inner monologue or in the story. They were more like decoration, like tools to further the story along. Thus, none of Violet‚Äôs friends ever feel like real characters on their own..I loved the dragons in the first book; they were my favourite part of the entire book. But now, I couldn‚Äôt care less. Tairn used to be this sassy, grumpy dad-type, but now he was just a flat, monotone character with no real personality. Everything he said was repetitive, and his entire character just seemed way too simple and lacking any sort of depth. When it came to Andarna, I genuinely think her entire character was butchered. She used to be this cute and precious little baby, and now she turned into someone annoying, bitchy and arrogant without any meaningful connection to Violet. She was like an entitled teenager, and there‚Äôs a reason why nobody likes those.Of course, there were also other characters of whom I was really looking forward to seeing their story develop, but I didn‚Äôt get anything remotely satisfying when it came to them. Liam‚Äôs sister was only in a few scenes and in most of them she was just flat-out exasperating; everything about her character was anti-climactic.More importantly however, I feel like Dain just got completely ignored during this entire book. He used to be Violet‚Äôs best friend for such a long time and after it is revealed he didn‚Äôt even really do anything to betray her, Violet doesn‚Äôt remotely seem to care?? She doesn‚Äôt think about him and she doesn‚Äôt give him the time of day... she sort of forgives him but not really?? It was so weakly developed and I honestly expected more. It was, once again, very anti-climactic.Long story short, the only reason I somewhat enjoyed this book, and why I even finished it, is because I still felt a semblance of attachment to the story and these characters after book one, but even that wasn‚Äôt enough to keep me engaged for long enough. I couldn‚Äôt help but skim near the end of this book, because I was just so bored. I genuinely didn‚Äôt care anymore, and this book was just way too long for no reason. All in all, this was one big disappointment to me.'The Empyrean' series:1.Fourth Wing- 4.5 stars2.

This is not the place for me to share my personal beliefs and what is being done behind the scenes. I do NOT owe anyone any explanations here.

This is not the way to go about things, let\'s be rational and restore GR to a loving community. I just want to read in peace.LET\'S START WITH THE REVIEW""Trust me yet?""""With my life.""ü´†ü´†After having some time to recollect my thoughts, I do believe that in no way this was a perfect book. Yet it was so enjoyable and exciting. I loved it in all its imperfections. Xaden and Violet have my heart and the series seems to be getting darker and more powerful. But oh how I ate it all up ü§≠Was it better than Fourth Wing?The plot certainly was better but I do think people will find its execution a bit messy in general.Is it binge worthy?Absolutely, you just need time.So A LOT happens in this one, in fact way more than the first book.This book is so action packed and relationship focused, I didn\'t think I could love this series more but I really do.The best part about this was Tairn and Andarna. No one can tell me otherwise. I came in to love Xaden and Violet but the dragons... AHHHH üò©üò©‚ù§The book picks up immediately after the events of Fourth Wing and with no time wasted we jump into the story. Iliked the addition of new charactersand the way they all had their own personalities yet never overpowering.Felixand his sarcastic arse was top notch. I liked how he kept things real. I do believe the transition ofSolane\'sissues with Violet could have been smoothened a bit considering how strong she came to be. I absolutely LOATHEDVarrish.He\'s the equivalent of Umbridge I swear. Hated, hated, hated him. Those who have read Fourth Wing know, am not mentioning one of the characters, but I\'ll just say- his dynamic with Violet was chef\'s kiss ü§å""I want you exactly how you are, emotions and all. I want the woman I fell for...""ü©∂I lovedXadenand Violet.The groveling and reassurance THROUGHOUT the book was everything!!So we all know how things were left in Fourth Wing, and I expected Xaden to grovel his way for a few pages but our girl Violet made him grovel the whole time and I LOVED it. He was patient with her, he took his time with her. He made mistakes in this one too but he owned up to it and gave her answers.‚ù§Ô∏è\u200düî•She had 100 questions? He answered them all. She asked the same question a million times? He answered it each and every damn time. Someone tried to make her jealous? He confidently claimed and assured her every time. Yeah, exactly! That\'s the kind of man he is ü§≠üòå‚ö°I adoredVioletin this. Let\'s be honest, there will be a lot of people who will find her annoying and insecure in this one. I personally did not. To me it made sense. Everyone lied to her throughout her whole life. Almost every new person wants to kill her. She lost someone very close to her. Her issues with Cat although wasn\'t really necessary but made sense. It gave Xaden and Violet the opportunity to become confident in each other and gave the opportunity to trust each other again. I loved Violet was patient and open towards Xaden, well eventually ü§≠üêâNow let\'s get tomy babies- Tairn and Andarna.Y\'all if you adored them in the last book? You will LOVE them in this. Tairn was his sarcastic self, caring self and always giving his Silver One wisdom. I absolutely LOVED Andarna. Her adolescent self was so snarky, it was adorable. I wanted to protect them both, and especially my baby Andarna. Her reveals(Yes, multiple reveals üëÄ)had me gasping. I can\'t wait to see what else is in store for them.üî•Theside characters- Ridoc, Sawyer, Imogen and Rhiwere such good friends. The way they supported Violet through thick and thin. They had each other\'s backs. Sawyer and Jesina? They\'ll be cute together if it happens ü§≠ These four kept me laughing. They made the two main characters real and brought life to the book. B and Mira ü´°ü§°Dain and Cat-Bro now idk what to think about them üò≠üò© It feels weird. No they\'re not a couple or anything, just two idiotic characters....""I would have done the same thing you did because I\'m just as reckless for you as you are for me.""The romance. The spice. The action. The plot twists. The drama. The reveals. The writing. PERFECTü§≠ü§≠ I believe the torture scenes and the training bits were the best written parts as it showed how deep all of their bond was. Butthat one scene(can\'t spoil) had me bawling my eyes out, so heart touching and I just wanted to hold and hug him üò≠üò≠üò≠‚ù§ Those who have read it will know üò≠The reveals at theendtho OH MY GOSHHHH. Yes it\'s true I got spoiled for the ending but I didn\'t let it get to me. I was bummed but I ate it up because of how well Rebecca Yarros wrote it. The action was so good!! I couldn\'t put the book down at all. The cliffhanger tho üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠DAMN BRUTAL. DAMN. BRUTAL.Am gonna be obsessed with the next one too üò©üò© Can\'t wait for it.Be kind on the review. Or just move on, I won\'t tolerate any harassment on my reviews against my friends or me.~‚Ä¢~‚Ä¢~LET\'S GOOOOO'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'I thought the first half of this book was close to unbearable and the second half was riveting.Why an editor didn\'t suggest shaving off a hundred or so pages of this book I do not know.

Not to mention the fact that Yarros\' smutty talk is kinda cringe.I was so so close to skimming during the first half BUT I have to say I thought the book went on to redeem itself a lot in the second half.The politics and magic of this world are surprisingly quite interesting when they manage to rear their head in between Violet and Xaden\'s theatrics. Yarros developed side characters further and I really came to love the camaraderie between Violet, Rhi, Sawyer and Ridoc, as well as the developing relationships and tensions with new characters. I love the voices of the dragons. I enjoyed Varrish as a villain (one of the few things I did enjoy about the first half.)When we reached the battles at the climax of the novel, I couldn\'t look away. The action scenes were suspenseful and dramatic and the ending, though a bit predictable, made me actually interested in reading the next book.I admit I was shocked to discover three more books are planned.

I\'m going to need a moment to process all this.Many moments later...Right, onto my thoughts.Allow me a second to gush here. I love it when a book knows what it\'s there to do, and that is to entertain the reader. It isn\'t there to be slow or boring or god forbid, pretentious (shudders). Rather, its goal is to squeeze every ounce of joy and delight out of the pages, and that\'s what this series does best.Cracking open the first page, I was sucked right back into the world of Navarre and Violet Sorrengail. It\'s as if I\'ve never left it. Everything I loved from the first book is here‚Äînonstop action, characters I could root for, snarky dragons, and sizzling romance. I couldn\'t turn the pages fast enough.The only thing I didn\'t love was our main couple having squabbles for half the book over reasons I couldn\'t make heads or tails of. I get that Rebecca Yarros has to inject some sort of strife between them to keep things interesting, but I was just confused. But if it\'s that or hundreds of pages of lovey-dovey mush, I guess I\'ll take confounding couple problems any day.I always have a sliver of trepidation going into book 2 of a series. What if my enjoyment of the first book was a fluke, a figment of my imagination? Or that the author somehow found the magical formula once, but can\'t reproduce it again? Or worse, that there\'s no interesting story left to tell? But I needn\'t worry becauseIron Flamecontains all the magic of its predecessor.I will say though, going in, the length at more than 600 pages was a bit daunting. But once I started, it didn\'t even matter. I was riveted throughout. It felt like every single page served a purpose‚Äîexcept for the aforementioned confounding couple problems‚Äîbuilding momentum and eventually hurtling towards a stunning conclusion. Honestly, if there were another 600 pages, I\'d happily gobble those up too.Before this book, I admit I was a bit puzzled that there could be five books in this series, like how much more is there to this story? But seeing the way Yarros has built out the universe and the war in this book, and especially that ending, I get now how there could be so much more to this. And I\'m glad. I\'m not sure I\'m ready to say goodbye to Navarre any time soon, so I\'m happy there are still a few more books to come. I just hope the wait isn\'t too long.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:#1.Fourth Wing~~~~~~~~~~~~‚úßConnect with me‚úßInstagram‚úß'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""1 StarAlright, I'm not going to rant or be very specific in this review because I know many people are still currently reading the book.

Not that Violet\'s development was any better.I absolutely loved the tension between Violet and Xaden in Fourth Wing, but once the relationship passes that phase it\'s tricky for authors to keep it interesting and it certainly fell short in this sequel.I don\'t know if I\'m the only one who feels this way but this book was heavy in dialogue and information dump and that\'s why it felt like it was dragging..The drama between some of the characters had me roll my eyes because most of it was so unnecessary we could be doing other far more interesting things than this.I\'ll just highlight a few spoilers below to get some points across so beware..............[Iron Flame Spoilers Ahead].............First of all, the jealous ex trope should be on every author\'s list of banned tropes. It always results in unnecessary drama and tension between the couple that I do not need especially when they have far more important issues they need to resolve between them. Imighttolerate it if they weren\'t an established couple, but if they are then that\'s a big no no for me.I wanted to throw my kindle at the wall. It\'s just frustrating to read about.And speaking of Violet and Xaden\'s relationship, dancing around the whole ""trust"" issue while still hiding things from each other simply because the other didn\'t bother to ""ask"" was annoying and did not add anything to their relationship but to create unnecessary tension. Did Xaden actuallyworkfor earning back Violet\'s trust or was he just waiting around for whenever the time was convenient? And Violet\'s judgement and choices were often clouded by her longing and lust for Xaden.Still I found some of their scenes tender and sexy but it definitely is less appealing to me than it was in Fourth Wing. Their relationship has less substance now.Because of how lukewarm my emotions were throughout most of the book, the ending did not gut me as much.These thoughts reflect my own experience while reading this book.'}]"

Now, the commanding general‚Äîalso known as her tough-as-talons mother‚Äîhas ordered Violet to join the hundreds of candidates striving to become the elite of Navarre:dragon riders.But when you‚Äôre smaller than everyone else and your body is brittle, death is only a heartbeat away...because dragons don‚Äôt bond to ‚Äúfragile‚Äù humans. They incinerate them.With fewer dragons willing to bond than cadets, most would kill Violet to better their own chances of success. The rest would kill her just for being her mother‚Äôs daughter‚Äîlike Xaden Riorson, the most powerful and ruthless wingleader in the Riders Quadrant.She‚Äôll need every edge her wits can give her just to see the next sunrise.Yet, with every day that passes, the war outside grows more deadly, the kingdom's protective wards are failing, and the death toll continues to rise. Even worse, Violet begins to suspect leadership is hiding a terrible secret.Friends, enemies, lovers.

ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW IS THAT THIS WILL BE YOUR NEW FAV BOOK FOREVER <3But for everyone else who needs to know‚Ä¶Here‚Äôs a quick rundown of the book:it‚Äôs about the daughter of a high-ranked general, Violet, getting ordered into learning how to become a dragon rider (but she doesn‚Äôt initially want to bc all she‚Äôs known are books her entire life) and so she commits to basgiath War collage where she goes through trials designed to root out the weak. She has to figure out how to best everyone and weaponise her strengths. While navigating her feelings for a certain forbidden boi. There‚Äôs romance AND (back arching) spice with sparks and tension galore. Also for everyone wondering, the ending isn‚Äôt that bad. It‚Äôs more of a promising cliffhanger. Makes you feel hopeful rather than making you want to crash and burn everything in your line of sight lmao.*I‚Äôm sorry in advance bc this review is gonna be gigantisaourus*wags brows* do you see what I did there?It‚Äôs been ages since I‚Äôve loved all the MCs in a book so I deserve to go crazy on the fangirling, leave me alone üôèThis book. THIS BOOK- It gives you EVERYTHING you crave in romantasy. The drama, the characters, the plot, the action, the betrayal, the romance, the tension, THE HOPE THAT THERE ARE STILL AMAZING BOOKS OUT THERE IN THE WORLD-AND IT JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER-There is not a single dry page. Not one. It constantly stimulates your imagination. And there aren‚Äôt the usual boring unnecessary bs conversations happening, they‚Äôre almost always full of banter and in every chapter, something is happening. It‚Äôs fast-paced and that‚Äôs something I ADORE about this book.BUT CAN WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE FUCKING TENSION PLS??The addictive chemistry between XadenVi will chew you up, eat you alive and then shit you out, effectively altering the composition of your DNA forevermoreüò©‚ù§Ô∏è\u200dü©πThe dialogue in this book is so yummy istg I was always giggling and kicking my feet whenever the MCs would interact ü§≠üíóü¶ã they‚Äôre both sarcastic funny smart and complement each other sm.

There‚Äôs a perfect amount of every aspect in this book, I‚Äôll never be able to get over it.While reading, it leaves you feeling as though you‚Äôve lost a limb whenever you have to remove yourself from the book to carry out the most trivial inconvenience like feeding and hydrating yourself üò§üî™I'm telling you this book is the only sustenance I need to keep me alive üôèViolet is me. I am Violet. We are one.No bc she is the most relatable character I‚Äôve read in a long ass time. The way she is so reasonable, empathetic and HAS INTEGRITY. She‚Äôs not a pushover. She knows her mind and isn‚Äôt afraid to speak it when she feels the need to. There‚Äôs no ‚Äòmy body is betraying me‚Äô bullshit. Not in this house. I‚Äôm in LOVE with violet sfmmm. She owns her feelings and demands what she‚Äôs owed. And when Xaden challenges her but she takes it as an incentive to poke and tease him back tenfold is ‚ú®üíóü¶ãü§åWatching her grow and become stronger was one of the most satisfying things about this book. Her character development was elite. She never changed her morals but she always adapts and moves on quickly and I cannot stress enough hm I love that about her.There wasn‚Äôt a single moment where I was annoyed at her for being hardheaded. She‚Äôs strategic but also carefree. She behaved like a normal 20-year-old would, not older/younger.XADEN is such a seductive menace but he‚Äôs MY precious seductive menace.He's always up for a challenge and he SERVES every freaking time. I love everything he has to say. He‚Äôs such a lil softy when it comes down to it. Him showing his love through his actions and constantly challenging Vi to do better??It‚Äôs the way he never coddles her but also shaves years off his life, worrying about her safety for me ü•πüíóüôèüò©ü¶ãüíû‚ú®üß∏I‚Äôm always waiting on hands and feet for any interaction with him whether it be his glares ü§≠theirnot so shortglances across the classroom üíûhis sarcastic quips üíÖhim being a brooding surly grumpüò©him being lethally calm üëëhim obsessed with her every move üôèüíóHim telling her not to look at him like that bc he only has sm restraint??ü§å‚ù§Ô∏è\u200düî• (I have to note that Lance did it better sksksksk) BUT EVERYTHING HE DOES IS HOT PLS-The way I fell for him the first moment he was described??

They rule themselves. They're the real legends here. And the way this author has weaved them into the book is just MWAH *chefs kiss*The found family in this book is the most precious thing ever.I loved to read how they‚Äôre bonded together and I can see that each relationship has the potential to grow into something really special ugh I cannot wait for the next books üò©OkaySPOILERS ahead!!bc your girl gotta scream <33---When Tairn came out of wherever tf he was hiding I was screaming and legit shaking from the adrenaline. I‚Äôm still having a hard time accepting how good this book is! I thought she would only get Andarna and I was kinda disappointed bc the moment Tairn got mentioned in that lesson I JUMPED ON THE IDEA OF HIM SO FAST YOU DONT UNDERSTAND. But when he came to save her and Goldie AND THEN SPOKE TO HER IN HER MIND?? I BROKE DOWN AND HOWLED. SO. FUCKING.

Me: (;¬¥‡ºé‡∫∂Ÿπ‡ºé‡∫∂`) X 100And the fact that her brother is alive made me do a lap around my garden from sheer satisfaction bc I WAS FUCKING RIGHT. 15% in I guessed that he would be alive but he‚Äôll be part of the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù side of the war and it‚Äôs been kept a secret bc of the shame/treason and AHHH *does cheerleader flip and cartwheel*And Dain?? That pussy ass lil BITCHHHH- I wasn‚Äôt born with enough middle fingers to let you know hm I feel about him.

The action aspect of the book gets a LOT better towards the end imo but the start was a little rusty and needed some finesse but idc idc I‚Äôll take it, faults and all. After all, I‚Äôm a character development lover so I can overlook it.BUT THE WORLD BUILDING IS- „ÉΩ(‚ô°‚Äø‚ô°)„ÉéOml the way this author writes leaves you ON THE EDGE WHITE KNUCKLING YOUR SEAT GASPING SHAKING SCREAMING bc you have no idea what will happen next.IT'S THE BIGGEST FLEX TO NOT ONLY OUTDO THE OGS BUT TO EXCEL PHENOMENALLYYYYY AT IT AS WELL üíÖ‚ú®REBECCA YAROS YOU ARE AN ICON BC I GOBBLED UP EVERY SCENE EVERY CHAPTER EVERY WORD.ùó¶ùó∂ùó±ùó≤ ùóªùóºùòÅùó≤:I think it‚Äôs become my favourite fantasy book ever.

The dragons make sure of that.‚ùûIn the beginning, Karen aka General Sorrengail, forces Violet to join Rider\'s Quadrant, a place where people become riders and form bonds with dragons.This is in contrast to Violet\'s original plan of following her father\'s path and becoming a scribe, responsible for documenting history. This makes her feeling angry and fearful because the decision is up to her mother, and she has no choice but to agree. She wasn\'t mentally or physically prepared for this challenge and have to do anything to survive.‚ï∞‚îà‚û§ VIOLET SORRENGAIL AKA VIOLENCE:‚ùùYou look all frail and breakable, but you‚Äôre really a violent little thing, aren‚Äôt you?‚ùûDespite dealing with a chronic illness (ehler\'s danlos syndrome) and having weak joints, she was incredibly awesome and strong! Her personality was so relatable that I felt connected right away.Her anxieties and fears during challenges in the rider\'s quadrant, and how she conquered them with her smarts, were truly inspiring. She showed that knowledge is real power! Her rollercoaster of emotions‚Äîfear, anger, desire, happiness‚Äîkept me amazed.Even when teased and called weak, she never let anyone walk all over her. And fr, I didn\'t even get that \'oh I\'m so tiny and frail\' or the \'pick me vibes\' as mentioned somewhere because she actually had a illness.I would\'ve dashed for the hills (or the scribe quadrant in Violet\'s situation) when every single cadet was dead set on killing me!It was like half luck, and 25% thanks to the dragon scale corset, and another 25% to Violet\'s intelligence that kept her alive!And - wait XADEN PROTECTED HER WELL TOO! ü§≠‚ùùWhat I lack in strength, I make up for in speed.‚ùû‚Äî She kept training and had a lot of improvement and her skills with the daggers were impeccable! landing straight on the target.‚ï∞‚îà‚û§ XADEN RIORSON:‚ùùStay the hell away from Xaden Riorson.‚ùûFantasy men are just FINE AF! From the beginning, he exudes a mysterious aura. Despite the stern lines on his face and a SCAR ON HIS LEFT BROW ü•µ, he exudes both danger and allure.His character captivates me so deeply that even if I hadn\'t known he was the mmc, I would have rooted for him.fuck Dain.Xaden comes across as grumpy and ruthless, concealing his emotions behind a stoic facade.However, his interactions with Violet reveal a thoughtful, kind, and trusting side that filled me with so many emotions. It\'s this side of him that I adore. üíûHe holds the position of the wing leader of FOURTH WING with great authority. His intelligence and power are remarkable, and don\'t even get me started on the way he walks, talks, and smirks ‚Äì it leaves me utterly on my knees for him!üßé\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏èHis character possesses incredible depth, and I would\'ve loved to have his POV.He\'s a shadow wielder, and just by imagining the shadows around him, his rebellion relic, and his scar ‚Äî I feel something inside of me! üòÆ\u200düí®REBECCA ADDED EVERY QUALITY TO MAKE HIM THE HOTTEST CHARACTER! ü§≠‚Äî Ruthless who? He\'s such a softie....üî™ gave Violet training for sparring matches.üî™ made a saddle for her to be seated on her dragon.üî™ made a custom dagger for her.üî™ killed a room full of cadets who tried to kill Violet, just by using his shadows.üî™ took care of her when she was hurt.üî™ punished a wing leader who tried to kill Violet.‚ï∞‚îà‚û§ DRAGONS:‚ÄîSo the most sarcasticpersoncreature award goes to TAIRN!ü´°God, how much I loved this grumpy broody dragon! He was one of the deadliest and strongest dragons, and he was bonded with none other than Violet! ü§≠ His remarks were so sarcastic and savage, and the way he always scoffed and knew about her feelings for Xaden. Hehehe, and he also adores Sgaeyl sm!If he were actually a human, he\'d be so grumpy and possessive, I\'M TELLING YA\'LL! üòÇüíï‚ùùAnd to think, I‚Äôd almost forgotten just how loquacious humans are.‚ùûAndarna:This cutie goldie dragon‚ÄîOMF, she was such a cutie! I loved how optimistic and innocent she actually was and possessed great powers, but she was only 2 years old! And the fact that she\'s also bonded with Violet ü•∫Sgaeyl:We didn\'t get much about her, though hopefully in the next book, but I\'m so glad she and Tairn are bonded mates! GOD SHE HAS A BRILLIANT TASTE IN MEN. ü•µ‚Äî ENEMIES TO LOVERS WHERE HE WANTS TO KILL HER? *Sign me up*‚ùùHe‚Äôs a third-year, and he will kill you the second he finds out who you are.‚ùûXaden is the son of Fen Riorson, known as THE GREATEST TRAITOR due to his leadership in a rebellion group. Sadly, this resulted in the execution of all rebel group members in front of their children, who were then marked with a relic symbolizing the rebellion.These children were forcibly placed into the Rider\'s Quadrant, where they faced the challenge of survival. The overseeing figure during these executions was none other than General Sorrengail (Violet\'s mother),so they\'re enemies, and he\'s the one who\'s gonnakillhandle her.ü§≠The enemies-to-lovers approach in this book was really well done.It felt very realistic and stayed true to the idea that \'children shouldn\'t be punished for their parents\' mistakes.\' The kids marked by the relic understood this, and Violet did too. What I especially liked was how Xaden and Violet\'s relationship grew naturally without being burdened by guilt from their pasts.Even though they weren\'t enemies for very long, the book didn\'t rush their journey to becoming lovers. Instead, it skillfully portrayed the gradual development of trust, as well as their decision to let go of their desires, leading them to eventually fall in love. ‚ô•Ô∏èViolet was super confused by Xaden\'s behavior. Rather than harming her, he encouraged her and saw her potential. He treated her as strong, not fragile, which both confused and intrigued her. üòâ‚ùùGoing for blood today, are we, Violence?‚ùûAfter Threshing (where the cadets were bonded with dragons), Violet discovered that Tairn, her dragon, was actually the bonded mate of Sgaeyl, Xaden\'s dragon. This connection tied the four of them together, and if one of them died, they all would. This meant Xaden couldn\'t consider killing her anymore, (not that he had intended to in the first place.) ü•πTHE SEXUAL TENSION WAS TENSIONING.ü•µ The sexual tension between them was incredibly strong! The heated lust-filled stares, locking eyes, proximity on mats, and more, yet neither wanted to act on it. Their first kiss was incredibly passionate and I was so giddy at that time. There were 3 graphic scenes but Damn they were HOT AF! ü´£üî•‚ùùI am annoyingly aware of everything you do.‚ùûNOT THEM SHATTERING WINDOWS, BREAKING ARMOIRES AND CHAIRS, BURNING CURTAINS AND FORESTS WHILE DOING ‚ú®IT‚ú®.‚ï∞‚îà‚û§ SIDE CHARACTERS:Rhiannon and Rodic:They were literal babies and I loved how both of them supported Violet! Idk when and how Rodic made his place in my heart but he was so cute. Always adopting humor for every situation and was so calm hehe! ü•∫ Am I the only one who wants them together?Like who Tara, Sawyer, or whatever his name is, just give Rhi and Rodic.Sawyer, Imogen, Bodhi, Garrick, Emery, Heaton:I loved how they all became a squad and clearly I would love more of them!Mira Sorrengail:This badass cutie, sexy hot, I love her! ü•µ She\'s so fierce and the best sister ever! üíûLiam Mairi:WE WERE ROBBED OF HIM. I WILL NEVER EVER FORGET HIM, please he was so precious. ü•∫üò≠ I literally cried so much when he died! I already had a feeling that he might die, but god it was so painful. I was so badly hurt when he died. It was so painful to see him dying and then Xaden calling him Brother. My heart broke! I\'m never forgetting that piece of shit Dain.Dain Aetos:This bitch, this traitor, this asshole, what the fuck! Why did he have to go and pull a full traitor-Adam-Kent behavior like bitch fuck off??I actually reasoned with him in the start and ignored him because he was just there to discourage Violet and gaslight her again and again by using \'best friend\' but he so skillfully and fucked-uply betrayed her.IF HE DIDN\'T READ VIOLET\'S MEMORIES (by touching her face) and then not telling his father, LIAM WOULD BE FUCKING ALIVE. FUCK OFF, DAINNN. I WISH YOU GET SCORCHED BY TAIRN! ü§¢‚ùùStop. Fucking. Coddling. Her.‚ùû‚Äî yeah, bitch, get that!Jack Barlowe:He was a piece of shit just like Dain and I\'m glad he was Violet\'s first kill, haha served him right! I don\'t want to give him more importance; he was shit AF! His death was so satisfying üòóü§ùüèªLong-haired Luca and Traitor Tynan getting scorched was the best thing.General Sorrengail:I dislike her already and I know I\'ll loathe her in the next books, but the only good thing was she trusted that Violet is capable of becoming a rider.Syrena (Flier):She\'s a gryphon rider and had only 2 scenes, but I wish we get to see her in the next books!‚Äî some other things:1. I literally choked on my laugh when I read about how smartly Violet won all the sparring matches because she poisoned every player with different types of herbs during the match, and her choosing the breakfast duties to add the poisons in their lunch was such a badass move!It\'s truly proven by Violet that knowledge is power.2. When Dylan died, my heart just stopped for a moment, and I was so horrified when Aurelie died! (Guess I\'m just going to grieve for Liam baby now.)3.All the challenges gave me Squid Game vibes, like all those tasks just to survive and so many deaths each day!Ugh, It was so fun yet horrifying to read. ü§ß4.""Fuck, that stubborn, feisty look always makes me want to kiss you.‚Äù‚Äî these beautiful words!!?? ü§≠5.

This is a long review1- it dissects a lot in the book, if this is not a clue for you that there are spoilers then maybe check your IQ.2- For those who are saying ""make it short"" you know you could scrol by and not read right? just take your own advice especially if you love this book and move along to the millions of 5 star reviews3- STOP SAYING NOTHING IS ORIGINAL..I can slap you with at least 20 books written in 2923/2024 that has more originality than this book! We are not asking for a Tolkein level of originality, but if you cannot even come up with your own character description and had to take the literal description from other books (among others) then why are you even called an author?4- in a world that is coming soon to be drowned with AI movies and clips and pictures, I do not want to read an AI book. and I do not mean that the author used AI (Although at this point no one knows), I mean the copy, paste, and stitch from other booksother than that, knock yourself outThe sad reality is this book will probably be GR best fantasy of 2023 though it has NOTHING of the fantasy elementsIf I wanted to read cheap immitation of every other fantasy book then this book it is üò°üò°üò°üò°every time I have an atom of hope that there is something 0.0000001% original, someone casually points out that it\'s not!IMPORTANT NOTE FOR READERS AT THE ENDIs this the future of books? writers shamelessly taking others\' work without even bringing their own to the table and the unknowing masses cheering them on!by now, this has become a game of ""SPOT THE COMMON, AND FIND THE DIFFERENCE""this book does not deserve an ounce of respect and this came after confirming that even the main characters\' descriptions are literally takenPLEASE STOP SAYING THAT NOTHING IS ORIGINAL ANYMORE! YEAH? PROVE ITAND EVEN IF THIS IS TRUE, IF A WRITER FAILS TO BRING AT LEAST 20% ORGININALITY ONTO THEIR BOOK, DO THEY DESERVE TO BE CALLED WRITERS???It is one thing to sample an idea or concept from ""a book"", it is another to take the whole storyline and plot from ""a book"" or in this case ""books"" and make it your own.This book is a memory quiltMade from old stuff to look newIt takes everything that we know as familiar, comfort and nostalgic and weave it together to present it as something new giving you a FAKE sense of enjoymentLet\'s imagine that I am a new reader or someone who never reads fantasy or someone who hasn\'tread and loved the other books mentioned down üëáüèª I would have absolutely adored this book and considered it one of the best Adult fantasy this year because I knew nothing of them.And surprise surprise! This is what is happeningbut ignorance is not an excuse!Just because you haven\'t read it does not mean it is OK for this book to copy everything!starting this book, I liked that the characters were older than 18. As much as I enjoy YA, sometimes the age just throws me off! However, they still acted like a bunch of 16 and 17 yr.the lingo itself was so cringeimage:I read many YA characters more mature than the main characters in this bookread Ageless and Warda\'s one 1 star review of this book to understand where these characters went wrongThis book attempted to give us a badass female lead that understands that she is flawed, and recognizes her physical incompetence, but does not give a shit. She knows her worth and trusts her intelligence to be her biggest asset so she uses it to get what she wants. She is unapologetic. She knows that if she can‚Äôt be cunning, it\'s her life on the line. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never get over how quickly people move on around here, how callously death is swept under a rug and trampled on minutes later‚Äùbut, personally, this failed. Because Violet was the typical ""I am weak in the body but somehow I can wip all your asses and accomplish anything"". She is supposed to have a sort of chronic pain that renders her in the disabled category. This is not said out loud in the book. You have to guess it yourself if you are not familiar with the symptoms or learn it from social media. So, it was a role-eye for me seeing her winning every challenge by cheating (which I accepted at first because she was disadvantaged) but then we get no information on how she trained and made herself stronger!. so what was the point of giving her a disability if we cannot see how she overcame it? Also, It was annoying at times seeing Violet practically throwing herself at Xaden like ‚ÄúPick me, choose me, love me, fuck me‚Äù. Girl! Have some dignity. But who can blame her, X is hot and has""Shadow hands, iykyk.... looking at you ACOTAR and ToG fans""and let‚Äôs not forget the dragons! I mean who doesn‚Äôt love dragons? Throw in dragons with personalities who can hold a conversation and you get yourself a winnerBut these bastards decided with their ever Holly wisdom that a person with a mental disorder (look up Aboulomania) or with a bit of a bitchy attitude is weak and should be scorched to deathI am not going to touch on the characters more than that. Others have explained in detailed reviews the problems with the main leads.And the world building? Excuse me! What world building! If you can answer one question that\'s been nagging me (from the book, not theories) then I\'ll shut up about itA dragon without its rider is a tragedy.\xa0A rider without their dragon is dead.Why? Why is it this way?However, there is abig issuethat is nagging at me and making feel like I am sitting on the most comfortable sofa in the world but someone has put a cushion full of needles at my back. Every time I get a little bit relaxed, a needle pricks my spine or neck or back arm.THIS BOOK HAS NOTHING ORIGINAL AND I DARE ANYONE TO PROVE OTHERWISEWhat this book did is take several old famous ideas from other books and movies, weave it together, and the author simply tailored them with spray edges and a catching cover for bait to come up with a supposedly new book that would please young readers mostly. to quote my friend: ""This book scratches an itchand boy! did this strategy work!This did not sit well with me because :One: the author did not just take from one or two books, she took from several.Two: these ideas were not just inspiration or sampling, in many parts were almost literalThree: copying and sampling are OK as long as the book brings it\'s own added plot or storyline which in this case, Fourth Wing did notWhen I was annotating this book, I marked each time I found an almost literal resemblance to other books. (yellow marks the number)So lets begin (and I am keeping the best or worst to last)Let me begin with the main characters descriptionNo, this is not Violet Sorringale. This is Mare Barrow from Red Queen series. Brown and silver hair and lightning powerAnd the whole ""assumed dead brother who is resurrected and turns out he joined the rebellion""YeahIt\'s like FW has this weird fixation on this seriesbut Violet braids her hair you say! you know who else has silver braided hair and dragons?and how about this one?no this is not Xaden Riorsonthis is either the tall dark and all powerful Rhysand and his Shadow power (and Rhys sacrificed himself for his people, Xaden did as well)or the tall dark and handsome Dorian and his shadow handsBut Xaden has a scar on his face, near his eye more precisely! You know who else tall dark and handsome with an eye scar and rhymes with Xaden!Meadows baby! Our last name is MeadowsNo!? OK, here\'s another tall dark and handsome with scars and is always surrounded by showdows and his name starts with Az and ends with ""are you for real?!""Now, here\'s a trivia for youLet\'s count the number of books where if the guy has Shadow powers the girl gets a control over lighteningJust off the top of my headRed QueenShadow and BonesThe Shadow of Lightening .. etc.Now the plotline1-\tHarry Potter: not talking about magic systems and dragons because many books have those, but ‚Äúthe cadets are thrown into ‚Äúfour wings‚Äù upon their arrival, they have to study and compete by gaining ‚Äúpoints‚Äù and showing skills both physically and mentally.. The literal taking was from p 313 when there is a‚Äútournament‚Äùwhere they had to‚Äúretrieve a stolen treasure‚Äùto‚Äúearn 60 points‚Äù2-\tDivergent: I knew that this book was marketed as a combination of Divergent meets Game of Thrones I think, but it took the inspiration too far. I don‚Äôt want to read a cheap imitation of Divergent which this book had. The cadets are distributed into quadrants (factions). Violet ends up in the Riders (Dauntless) quadrant where if you show any sign of weakness you are either killed by a fellow cadet or scorched by a dragon!And the Tris/Four moment between Violet and Xaden is also hard to miss. She has a parent/sibling issue, he has a daddy issue. She fantasizes about him all the time (which is nauseating and untasteful at times). Him beating her ass and showing her that he hates her and maybe wants to kill her then ending up saving her life and training her. Even the knife-throwing scene was taken. And it goes on and on3-\tThe Hunger Games: this whole book was the Hunger Games ‚Äì Dragon Edition. The cadets are literally allowed to kill each other even under the watchful eyes of their superiors. But that is not surprising when the professors so simply snap a cadet‚Äôs neck infront of others. I guess ‚Äúthe odds are always stacked against them‚Äù yep! This was in the book!And since they are at war and need soldiers, what better way to show how desperate they are than killing off their cadets, instead of sending them off to the other houses üôÑüôÑ4-\tShatter me/ACOTAR: What are these two series famous for? You guessed it. The predictable love triangle where the first love interest turns out to be a douche and the heroine ends up falling for the dark morally grey character. This is really starting to sound repetitive and obvious.5-\tThrone of Glass (Empire of Storms): Dorian Havilliard has Phantom hands and Xaden has Shadow hands! Both can lift and hold anything with these ‚Äúhands‚Äù and use them during intimate moments. In the beach scene, Aelin and Rowan‚Äôs passion fuses their power together and lose control. Same with Vi and X6-\tMulan: (yep! The animation) Mulan shows her strength and proves herself to her camp by using her wit to climb the pole using the weights instead of carrying them to retrieve the arrow and later they use their belts to climb the columns of the palace. The same move Violet uses by planting the rope around the shaft to climb it.7-\tHow to train your dragon: from the description of the dragons, to the lowering of the eyes when meeting one, to the Hiccup and Toothless moment, and the big scarry dragon and the small golden cute one, you cant help noticing these similarities when reading this bookBUT HERE ARE THE MOST OBVIOUS COPY CAT ISSUES8- The plot conflict of the book is the same as Game of ThronesSo instead of the seven kingdoms, Navarre is divided into six but with the province in the east makes it seven! To protect itself, Navarre has built a WARD (wall) around its borders to stop an enemy that we later learn about. This enemy is ruled by a Sage (night king) who creates these venin, monsters that are destroyed only by a special material (valerian steel) which the cadets are forging into blades!people inside the kingdom think that those creatures are just folklore. Venins have the ability to make dragon-like creatures, wyverns, that can breathe BLUE FIRE and dies immediately if their creator diesimage:And the h that has the baddest dragon has silver hair which is always in a braidüôÑand thought at first to be fragile and weak!9- Dragon Riders of Pern and Eragon (edited,) I originally related it to Eragon but many friends pointed out that the whole concept of dragon riders bonding with the chosen dragon and that such a dragon can mentally communicate with its rider through witty conversations and big personality is from the mother of all Dragon stories - the Dragonriders of Pern by Anne McCafferyEven the scene where V and X feel horney bec of the Dragon lust is definitely not original to The Fourth Wing10- Dragon School: Just when you think that having Voilet be a Female main lead with a disability is something original of this book, you find out it is not! Dragon School is an acclaimed YA book series by K.L Wilson published in 2017 about sixteen-year-old Amel who joins the Dominion Dragon Riders. But Amel has not only a crippled leg but also chronic disease and Dragon School training is grueling. Before she can even become an initiate, she must complete her First Flight on a dragon. Everyone around Amel thinks she will die before her first ride because of her fragile state and disability. SOUNDS FAMILIAR?Bonus courtesy of @Soyas.ReadingpalaceThis is the map of the Fourth WingThis is the map of the Witcher booksnotice anything?so, there is nothing original about this bookYou want to take the characters\' descriptions? fineoh, you want to take also the plot conflict? finewhat? you want also all the famous plotlines?BUTWhat are you bringing to the table then?????Another side issue that bugged me which was the queer representation. What representation??? I didn‚Äôt see any! A representation is when you have a character or a couple of them who are queer. This book made it out as if everyone is Bi and that it is natural for everyone to jump into bed from man to woman. If this is everyone, then this is the norm of the society in the book and there is no representation.I think that this book would be enjoyed by a person who hasn‚Äôt read the above-mentioned books or doesn‚Äôt want to read them so you get to read a mash-up of them. If you are this person, then this book is perfect for youHowever, I am a reader who values authenticity not imitation done blatantly.

Yeah, that‚Äôs exactly how I feel after finishing Fourth Wing.Summary:There are only two ways to leave Basgiath War College: graduate or die. \u2060\u2060Violet was supposed to enter the Scribe Quadrant and live a quiet life among books. However, when her mother, the commanding general, forces her to join the Riders Quadrants to become a dragon rider, she must push herself past all limitations in order to survive. \u2060\u2060Staying alive would be a lot easier if Violet didn\'t have a target on her back for not only being \'small and frail\' but the daughter of the woman responsible for the deaths of many cadet\'s traitorous parents, including Xaden Riorson\'s - the most powerful and ruthless wingleader. She should stay away from him, but a fire burns between these two that is bound to consume them both. \u2060\u2060With stakes this high, every day could be her last. So Violet must learn to do the one thing she was never trained to do: fight. \u2060""I will not die today."" -Violet Sorrengail\u2060WHAT TO EXPECT:‚ú® adult romantasy‚ú® true enemies to lovers‚ú® war college setting‚ú® dragon riders‚ú® magic‚ú® underdog fmc / chronic illness rep‚ú® scarred anti-hero mmc‚ú® unique world building‚ú® complex politics‚ú® found family‚ú® high stakes‚ú® insta-lust with slow burn‚ú® 2/5 üå∂Ô∏è (2 explicit spicy scenes)‚ú® cliffhanger endingMy Thoughts:I am utterly obsessed! Mark my words, this is the next big romantasy series!The writing is easy to digest, the world-building is fascinating, the heroine is an underdog and total badass, and the romance develops at a believable pace and is scorching! I laughed. I cried. And I fell in love. This book will forever live in my head rent-free! \u2060Violet Sorrengail is a secret badass!I LOVE her!!!!! She‚Äôs a twenty-year-old bookworm who‚Äôs expected to live a life as a scribe but now must survive and become a dragon rider. Physically, she‚Äôs smaller and frailer than the other cadets in the quadrant, but that doesn‚Äôt make her weak. Her mind is her strength and what she needs to survive. I love how Violet handles her situation with courage and grace and how she creates meaningful relationships at the risk of her own heart. She‚Äôs extremely relatable, and I can‚Äôt wait to see how she grows.Xaden Riorson...this man has easily become one of my top book boyfriends of all time!The son of a traitor, he‚Äôs out for revenge against Violet, whose mother led to his father\'s death. From a distance, he‚Äôs a scary, scarred, intense anti-hero, but deep down, he‚Äôs a man who is loyal, caring, and wise. And the way this man obsesses with Violet‚Ä¶.damn. You truly don‚Äôt know if he wants to kill or f*ck her, probably both, but yeah, it‚Äôs hot! The things I would let this man do to me. ü•µThe enemies-to-lovers romance was perfect, with an intense slow burn and eventually spice!I appreciated the time it took for these two to finally get together. And when they finally do, it‚Äôs explosive! Thank goodness this is new adult fantasy because the things Xaden says and did go straight to my core, lol.The dragons stole my heart.I don‚Äôt want to say too much because it would spoil some of the books, but they are terrifying and amazing!!! They have their own hierarchy and politics, which we don‚Äôt see much of since they‚Äôre very secretive, but it‚Äôs fascinating how they decide to bond with humans to create a symbiotic relationship that ultimately helps protect the land. Can\'t wait to learn more about them in the next book!The found family aspect was done so well!As a dragon rider, you\'re encouraged not to form strong attachments since most people in your school will either die before becoming riders or later on during battle. But Violet goes against this and finds her ride or dies - specifically Rhiannon and Liam! üíïThe world building so easy to understand yet very interesting.I‚Äôve never actually read a series focused on dragons and dragon riders, so this was new and exciting for me! It was so interesting learning about the different quadrants - scribe, rider, healer, and infantry - and the schooling required for each. Obviously, this story focuses more on the Riders Quadrant, which honestly is the most exciting because it\'s so intense, challenging, and cutthroat. I personally don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd survive, but maybe if I had a friend like Violet, it would be possible!PS: For all you Manon and Abraxos fans out there, you‚Äôre going to fall in love with this world!!!For the most part, the story was a bit predictable, but it‚Äôs all done in a way that I was entertained and excited to keep reading!I mean, we\'ve seen similar stories where the seemingly weak heroine finds herself in a kill-or-be-killed situation and has to learn to fight and ultimately ends up thriving. So in that regard, you can guess where the story is heading.HOWEVER . . .That ENDING was everything I was not expecting!Those last 50 pages were absolutely epic and blew my fucking mind!!!!!! I DID NOT see that ending coming! I cried and then was left stunned by that last sentence. It\'s a cliffhanger, but it\'ll leave you more in shock instead of in pain, so don\'t be afraid of it! It\'s brutal and will make you want to immediately pick up the next book. Luckily we don\'t have to wait for long since the release date is November 7, 2023!But with everything I love, there are a few things I didn\'t like . . .Sometimes, the wording Violet used to concerning Xaden was a bit repetitive and immature.She kept describing him as beautiful and hot anytime he crossed her mind or showed up. I wish she would have used other words from time to time.The reader has to essentially piece together why Xaden falls for Violet.It‚Äôs quickly explained later in the story, but by then, it felt like we were being told more than shown. I would have liked for him to verbalize it more during the story. At least, more than him just saying things like ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stay away from you‚Äùor ‚Äúyou‚Äôll be the f*cking death of me‚Äù. Every time he\'s say those things, I was like, tell me why, though!Overall, Fourth Wing is an epic story that you will devour! I wouldn‚Äôt say this is a perfect 5-star read, maybe it‚Äôs closer to 4.5 since it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äòperfect‚Äô, but honestly, I don\'t care. I haven‚Äôt read a fantasy I felt this way about in a long time, so I\'m giving it all the stars.Thank you, Entangled Publishing, for sending me an arc copy in exchange for a review.

I can\'t humanely comprehend how this has a higher rating than Six of Crows. I just can\'t. Here are the things I agree with that everyone has been saying:Good idea,fucking awful, god awful execution.And a little bit of a Shadow and Bone rip off if you ask me.She is supposed to be a scribe. She is forced to become a rider, she gets there, her childhood best friends who has always had feelings for her is mad that she is there, and worried that she won\'t survive. But don\'t worry, because theSHADOW WIELDERbad boy who hates her is there to train her and teach her all about that world. Oh and by the end she ends up being aLIGHTENING WIELDER. There hasn\'t been one in centuries.May the sun summoner bless you Fourth Wing, you\'re about to getroasted.Let\'s get the disability rep talk out of the way, many people told me there was some. And even if there is, the author approached the subject so so so subtlely I honestly couldn\'t even tell it was there. Because the only thing that was actually written was:I am so tiny, I am so weak, I am so fragile, frail, I will crumble. Please, don\'t send me to the dragon riding academy, because I am ramen noodle and I will break and die. Have I also mentioned I am white, pale, and very very very very thin? By the way, I am tiny. I am so smoll. I can\'t even jump on the dragon\'s back I am so small.How will she ever survive?I feel like for people who don‚Äôt know that specific disability, she doesn‚Äôt give you any insight? Like what does it mean? How does it happen? What is it called? As someone who had never heard of it before it was hard to even notice when she was talking about the disability. It didn‚Äôt bring any kind of awareness (which I‚Äôd think would be the whole point)Also someone who is this breakable can‚Äôt be having wild fucking sex but apparently we forgot about her disability during the sex scenes lmao.But it doesn‚Äôt matter because no matter what, everyone wanted to kill her and THERE WAS NO WAY SHE WOULD EVER SURVIVEIn this place where apparently people die daily, like flies. So much danger, so much death, so much struggle. That you don\'t see. You just hear about it because the author got too lazy to actually do any world building. So for the first half of the book there is just a bunch of telling and no showing.But don\'t worry, this frail, little pale, white girl, with white hair will bond not ONE BUT TWO of the rarest most powerful dragons alive. Even if she\'s not even tall enough to jump on their back.Also, enemies to lovers? Where? Where the fuck was that? These two have less chemistry than a priest with a hooker. Her mom is responsible for the death of someone in his family, so he blames her, he wants to kill her, he hates her from the momen the sees her (it lasts about two pages). But every time SHE SEES him, all she can think of is:""He\'s a shark and everyone next to him is a fish"", Dammit I don\'t want to find this asshole hot, but he\'s so hot"", "" ""omg, he calls me violence intead of violet, I am not attracted to toxic men but why do I want to bounce on his dick sooooooooooo bad...""So she basically sounds like a 14 year old valley girl for the entire book.They barely have any significant encounters, all of their interactions are so cringe that it makes me think this book should have been published in 2001. He smells like citrus, he has 107 scars on his back. And he tells her she\'s going to be the death of him every time he gets a chance.""He\'s a very dangerous addiction. Something women will kill for. ""If you catch me killing for men, please, end me first.Anyways, of course we have the most recycled sex dialogue on the plannet.OH GODS - WHICH GOD ARE YOU CALLING OUT FOR ITS JUST ME HERE AND I DONT SHAREThey fall deeply in love with each other, even though they barely interacted throughout the book, barely created a connection and didn\'t even hate each other at all for longer than a couple of pages. She bonds with the most powerful dragons alive, one of her dragons is mated to HIS DRAGON, and every time the dragons get horny SO DO THEY. So they have to learn how to control the hornyness coming from the dragons wanting to fuck.I wish I was joking.The book ends with avery predictable cliffhanger (which is a rip off from Red Queen and Divergent)and now this is one of the best selling books in the world.Watchu gonna do.I guess there is something out there for everyone. Part of me thinks that most people got paid really well to love this book so much. But that would be disingenuous of me to say, because I know people who didn\'t get paid who enjoyed it. So I guess I can see that this book might feel nostalgic.It gives you all the 2001 writing cringe fest, so if you missed reading something like Twilight, you\'ll definitely have fun. The characters are as childish as Zodiac Academy characters, so if you enjoy that, you might have a good time. She steals elements from Harry Potter, Shadow and Bone (most of the plot actually) ACOTAR, and used the writing style and sex scene lines most booktok people love, soBOOM! Best-Seller.Anyways, I am finally fucking free. I think I have learned my lesson and I willl chill on the booktok recommendations for a LONG LONG LONG TIME.She just ""borrowed"" SO FREAKING MUCH from many other popular series that this feels so unoriginal. It almost feels like she threw this book into an AI and said: write me a YA novel and the AI grabbed all the most popular series and put it in there. The sex scenes are all repetitive and recycled. It reads like YA, but it has none of the good aspects from YA, there‚Äôs too much sexual content that adds nothing to the plot (and this is supposed to be a fantasy series) So yeah, it\'s a no from me. Too bad as well because the dragons were cool.UPDATE:I was literally going through my old Throne of Glass highlights and found ANOTHER series this author ripped off. Aelin says she wakes up everyday and tells herself she will not be afraid. Guess who does that too in this series? ü§£'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""‚Äùthere is no me without you.‚ÄùI. NEED. THE.

I JUST LOVE MEN WHO SHOW THEIR LOVE THROUGH ACTIONS!!‚Äî i will take no slander on him EVER. he is that typical broody, morally grey love interest ppl roll their eyes over, but he has DEPTH. this man fr had me kicking my feet in the air, giggling and screaming into my pillow whenever he would call violet ‚Äúviolence‚Äù ü§≠ he is exactly what vi needed!! i just love how he always believed in her and only wants to see her at her full potential and succeed.the romance:oh my goddd, the romance was perfect!! üòÆ\u200düí®ü§åüèºthe slow burn?was burning, absolutely delicious.enemies to lovers?SPLENDID, BEAUTIFUL, EXECUTED PERFECTLY. i was itching for xaden and vi sm.the spice?DELECTABLE. TOE CURLING. the enemies aspect of this book was so satisfying, istg it had me going feral !! the tension was EVERYTHING. it's the perfect build up and the pay off is amazing once it happens.‚Ü≥dainis anotheradam kentloser side hoe. he acts like vi is some fragile little girl that needs constant protection, tells her to leave bc he wanted her to be a scribe like she was intended to be not a dragon rider and hides her away. he was constantly holding her back and questions her ability at every turn,, PLS HE IS ADAM KENT CODED. and the sort of love triangle was very juliette, adam and warner literally cut the mf cameras. his death arc when?? next book im praying.‚Ü≥tairn and andarna- they were the best addition to this book!! yarros done an incredible job with providing so much details about the dragons, their history and their personalities - i absolutely loved the interactions between the dragons and their riders - i fkn love tairn my grump, i adored his protectiveness over violet and would not even think twice about burning you alive if you hurt or touch her, yes xaden included lmaoo. he was so snarky it had me giggling w how sassy and unbothered he was. and i love how tairn and sgaeyl were a mated pair bc it ended up making violet and xaden tethered heh ü§≠‚Äúthere‚Äôs no where in existence youcould go that i wouldn‚Äôt find you, violence‚Äù‚Äî okay but i could enthuse ab every little detail of this book, but this is one of those stories that you NEED to read. you don't just read a book like this, you live in it and never want to return, specially bc in this world xaden exists and you get to ride dragons.this isn‚Äôt a perfect book there are some flaws, but this was perfect to me! like yes it is super predictable, yes it‚Äôs tropey, but am i obsessed? YES, YES I AM. it had everything i wanted in a fantasy book and so many dragons. this story will be something different to everyone, you‚Äôre either going to love or hate it, but you need to read this at least once in your life. but ahh i can‚Äôt wait to get my greedy little hands on iron flame, i needed that book in my hands yesterday.thank youamelie&hannahfor br w me!! ü©∑‚ú®""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '1.5/5New half-year resolution‚ÄîI need to stop taking recommendations from Booktok.I‚Äôm not gonna to lie here, if this series hadn\'t been raved about everywhere I looked online, I probably wouldn\'t have read it. I‚Äôm trying to stop reading TikTok popular books, but the rating in this book made me picked it up. Fourth Wing was my first book by Rebecca Yarros, so I didn\'t know what exactly to expect, but at least now I know that it will be my first and last story by this author, because it turned out not to be for me.This review probably won\'t cover all the things I didn\'t like about it, as I started skipping pages after about sixty percent of the book. But without further ado, let\'s finally get to the point of my review‚Äîwhat exactly didn\'t work out for me in this story.The story didn‚Äôt hooked me up from the beginning at all. The main reason for this is probably because the writing style didn\'t speak out to me. I actually dnfed it the day before, because of that reason, but decided to give it another chance because I thought it might not be my day for it or maybe I wasn\'t in the right mood after a whole week. At one point I was even glad about this decision, but my enthusiasm didn‚Äôt last long. I have to be honest and say that around forty percent of the book I was pretty invested in the story when the dragons finally showed up. Unfortunately, it turned out I was only interested when the dragons were involved. The rest was just boring for me.The second thing is that I felt no connection to the characters. Literally nothing. I must admit that Violet had some great moments, but most of the time I was just embarrassed by her actions. The example.‚ÄúGlad to see our year apart hasn‚Äôt dulled your tongue, Vi.‚Äù‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I toss over my shoulder as we walk into the hallway, ‚ÄúI can do quite a few things with my tongue. You‚Äôd be impressed.‚ÄùThat line sounded like a horny frat boy.Also, if you didn‚Äôt get it that she was short and tiny, the author kept reminding you of that, because that information was indeed very important.""I‚Äôm too short.""‚ÄúSo she‚Äôs small.‚Äù Mom scans me up and down""""Good gods, I don‚Äôt even reach his collarbone.""""I‚Äôm shorter than most.""‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pretty small for a rider, but it looks like you made it.‚Äù""I‚Äôm at a disadvantage, that I‚Äôm too small to climb its foreleg and mount,""‚ÄúYou‚Äôre tiny.‚Äù He says it like an insult""""I‚Äôm the smallest of our squad""‚ÄúI‚Äôm too short for the ramp,‚Äù I whisper to Rhi.""‚ÄúI‚Äôm too short to span the distance!‚Äù I hiss, uncaring that anyone could hear us.""\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200eThat\'s only from twenty-six percent of the book. I did not include the rest, because I would not have enough space for the rest of my review.Moving to Xaden‚Äîaka, your typical fantasy hero. Seriously. He was your usual tall, black haired, with strong sharp jaw, muscled body, but this time he was riding dragons. I almost forgot, he was""Flaming hot. Scorching hot. Gets-you-into-trouble-and-you-like-it level of hot.""you get the picture. He was also tall. I\'ve written about it before, but we\'ve also been reminded of it a lot. I had to mention that sentence he said here, because I was laughing my ass off at that moment.""You have incredibly touchable skin.‚ÄùTouchable skin? What does it mean buddy?Honestly, the dragons were more interesting than the main characters here. If the book was about Tairn, I\'d probably be more eager to read it. This dragon had better personality than both of them. At least for me. Tairn was literally my favorite character here. That says a lot about how much I enjoyed this book.The last thing is the romance between Xaden and Violet. This series is supposed to have five books and they already done the deed, are in love‚Äîprobably because I didn\'t make it to this part, and have a strong connection‚Äîagain, probably because I didn\'t make it to this part. I thought that at least their first meeting, which is usually quite important, will be more spectacular. But, no. They met in the fourth percent of the book and I was like""Well, that‚Äôs it? Already?"". They were supposed to be enemies to lovers, the reasoning behind it made even sense, but they deliverednothing.I felt no chemistry between them, no tension, especially the sexual one, and no hatred that they should feel towards each other as enemies. Almost every time Violet saw Xaden it went like that.""I hate him so much""\u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e""But he is so sexy and beautiful and sexy. And tall.""Not even their first kiss and the cute nickname the hero usually gives the heroine saved them. The first kiss happened after Violet found out that they could feel when their dragons banged.Yes, they could feel their dragons banging.This information made me feel quite uncomfortable. Extremely even. I know they could get rid of that with some magic or whatever, but just why? The nickname ""Violence"" that Xaden called Violet was tacky and the book could easily have survived without it. Not to mention this line.""you‚Äôre really a violent little thing, aren‚Äôt you?‚ÄùMy only thought wasFrom Blood and Ash. It sounds damn similar. Even though I only read the first book from this series.Moving forward to the things I liked.The dragons.Ending my review, all I will say is that I am pretty sad and disappointed that I didn‚Äôt end up liking this book. I wanted to start a new fantasy series that I would be obsessed with, but I guess we can\'t have everything we want. I‚Äôm happy for people who loved it though. Good for you guys.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'If I had a million dollars for every cliche in this book, of which there are a multitude, I\'d still regret spending $20 on all 498 pages of this mess.Spoilers to follow :)Let\'s start with the worldbuilding!Now, this book had two things I love dearly: dragons, and an academic setting. Yarros, however, explains almost every element of her world so poorly and sporadically that the entire story feels as though it were concocted page by page. The hierarchy of squadrons and sections and wings is so unnecessarily confusing. The whole ""war"" going on along the border is so vague, it was obvious from the start that some twist was going to reveal the good guys were actually the bad guys all along. The author\'s primary method of exposition is dropping pieces of information into conversations that feel forced and completely unnatural. No one talks like that. No one shares information like that.Now, the writing!The sentence constructions alone were enough to give me a headache. I can\'t tell you how many times I had to reread entire paragraphs because of poorly written and run-on sentences. As for the dialogue, let\'s discuss the fact that everyone talks like it\'s 2023, despite the medieval setting. I\'m not kidding, the female character asks herself at least twice, using these exact words, ""Is it toxic that I like this guy even though he can kill me?"" Yes. Yes it is. And so is all this internal monologuing. Please, end my suffering. Apart from the sentences and dialogue, the descriptions were severely lacking. Every location felt like a vague impression rather than an actual place. I don\'t think I\'ve ever encountered a book suffering from white room syndrome quite like this one.Now for the characters. Oh, the characters.Starting with the main event, we have frail young Violet who is SO relatable because she\'s SO clumsy and SO bad at things! Simultaneously, she is SO smart (like smarter than everyone) and SO unique that she gets not one, but TWO dragons to bond with her! And of course, they\'re both the rarest kind of dragons that exist!!! And naturally, everyone wants her dead for... reasons. But does her life being in danger give her any sense of self control? Absolutely not! She argues with everyone and throws her sass around to both peers and superior officers with little to no consequence. This woman has the survival skills of a fruit fly!! Additionally, her moods go back and forth quicker than an Olympic ping-pong match. First she hates Xaden because he\'s a traitor. Then she loves Xaden because she decides to trust him. Then she hates Xaden because he\'s a traitor. I\'m expecting the cycle will continue in Book 2. Also, she starts off wanting to be a scribe and gets pissed when she\'s thrown into the Rider\'s Quadrant, then she decides she desperately wants to be a Rider because... because? The decision is given hardly any explanation or emotional weight.And then there\'s discount Rhsysand. Oh wow, the moody black-haired rebel with tattoos is actually the good guy. Shocking. He\'s hard on the outside, but a softie on the inside. Groundbreaking. Also, the way that Yarros writes his character from Violet\'s perspective is downright sickening at times. From the very first scene with him, Violet\'s internal thoughts about Xaden are grossly objectifying. Everything is about his body, and how hot he is, and how badly she wants to sleep with him. There\'s an entire scene spanning two pages where Violet and another woman are straight-up ogling shirtless Xaden while he\'s sparring with another guy. It\'s disgusting. If the roles were reversed, if a male author wrote about a male character viewing a woman in the same way, heads would be rolling. It\'s gross, and frankly one of the most disappointing things about this book.Honestly, none of the other characters were interesting enough to write about. The dragons were fine, and probably the most likeable. Sawyer was the only human I found tolerable. Dain was just annoying, as he was clearly meant to be.Now, the plot.The majority of this book was consumed by Violet being horny and a random series of challenges. There was no explanation anywhere of what the academic year would look like, which makes me think the author was just making up more challenges and battles and war games as she went along. All of this, of course, leading up to a real challenge where we find out information that was abundantly obvious from the start. Oh no, the good guys are the bad guys. The bad guys are the good guys. The dead brother is actually alive. I wish I cared about any of this, but I don\'t because it\'s been so blatantly obvious since the first chapter. The pacing of this book was tedious in a lot of places because there wasn\'t really any kind of looming threat beyond the vague allusions to bigger attacks along the border. Nothing in this book surprised me. Nothing came even remotely close. Everything was so over-ridden with cliches and ideas from other books (mainly Divergent, and a little bit of Red Queen with the not-dead-brother ending) that nothing felt original or creative at all.I have searched earnestly, to the farthest hills on the horizon, for something good in this book. Alas, I return to my homeland empty-handed.And here\'s the thing: I so desperately wanted to enjoy this book, which makes it all the more disappointing. If you\'ve made it this far, I want you to know I did not approach this book with the intention of feeling this way. If you enjoyed this book, kudos to you. Feel free to keep on enjoying it. These are just my thoughts and opinions, and I\'ll content myself to be the cranky grandma of Goodreads if need be.

She\'s brave, compassionate, goes to lengths to protect others and knows how to stand up for herself and others. Having had chronic illness, people always underestimate her(all but one)but that\'s what makes her an underdog. I liked how balanced her character and personality was, never over the top. Loved following her journey through the war school and boy how she developed and grew in those pages.üñ§Xaden-Idk if anyone else is saying this but I will- Xaden has the same vibe that Warwick from Savage Lands does, but Xaden does it better. There\'s just something about their personality that\'s so similar. Give the Savage Lands series a go if you liked Xaden. Anyway, I loved him so much. He\'s a badass. Once her started opening up, and we got to see the softer side of him- I was swooning. He\'s powerful, sexy, and knows when to pick his battles, certainly not a push over.Dain-What an ass. Radiates the same energy as Tamlin in ACOMAF.The othersupporting charactersare good as well, they grow on ya- especially the dragons and Liam. Tairn and Adarana have my heart. I loved them since the first time they spoke. They have a sense of humour, are badass and protect so fiercely.

Of my time and money.I can‚Äôt decide whether to rate this 2 or 1 ‚≠êÔ∏è.It‚Äôs a 1 ‚≠êÔ∏è rating. ü§¶üèæ\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏èI‚Äôm about to drop some truth bombs,so if this is the type of book for you in where you don‚Äôt want to hear any form of slander, then look away.I‚Äôm going to be honest about my reading experience, which wasn‚Äôt all that great.üòìIt seems that fantasy romances, whether they‚Äôre adult or YA, have been using the same formula these past few years in where the focus solely lies on the plot and the action scenes and the same attention isn‚Äôt given to the characters and their world. And I do not understand why that is the case. The balance between them all is off.The characters (all of them, not a single one was interesting) lacked substance, background and history. So by nature, I‚Äôm not even remotely interested in rooting for them and seeing them overcome the challenges they‚Äôre facing, because they are so poorly developed to begin with.The foundation of this world felt unbelievably flimsy and read messy to me. It was supposed to feel dangerous, the stakes were supposed to be high. Characters were being killed left, right and centre and the only thing I felt was nothing.There was no order to the way it was being built upon. Just chaos, convenience and stupidity all round.Violet‚Äôs character could‚Äôve been made more interesting (to me) if:‚ñ™Ô∏èWe had we seen her time as a scribe before she was forced to become a rider.‚ñ™Ô∏èSee her actually train and get stronger.‚ñ™Ô∏èSee how she generally fought through her chronic pain.‚ñ™Ô∏èSee her deal with the grief of her brother.‚ñ™Ô∏èExplore the weird dynamic she has with her mother.‚ñ™Ô∏èSee the friendships forming and the romance truly developing.‚ñ™Ô∏èSee her fuckin‚Äô bonding with those dragons.All of these things would‚Äôve added nuance and depth to her characterisation, to the actual story itself. Are we privy to any of that? No. Those aspects are mentioned and that‚Äôs supposed to be good enough whereas I would‚Äôve liked layers.Characters shouldn‚Äôt read so one-dimensional.And enemies-to-lovers where? Please. üôÑ This trope was used in the most juvenile way.You could argue that the romance itself was juvenile.We could‚Äôve honed in on the hate since both these characters suffered losses, come from different and opposing backgrounds, have some real animosity and tension built between them but the love interest was hardly ever present.Next thing you know, the trope was flung out the window instead of it being morphed into something real.So, I fail to understand why this was sold as a fantasy romance.I can‚Äôt tell you why these two liked each other, let alone love. There was no development ofgenuine, romantic feelings.There was a buildup of attraction and supposed sexual tension. But that‚Äôs it.Another thing that bugged me is that we only got Violet‚Äôs perspective. I mean, this occasionally works, but ideally,no fantasy book should have a singular POV.I can‚Äôt begin to tell you how boring that narrative is.It gives such a limiting and subjective view of the world and the characters, and this especially gets more limiting when there are other characters present that also play a significant role in the story.Yet they weren‚Äôt utilised.Is it that hard to give different perspectives?The dragons were theONLYinteresting parts about this whole book.But they didn‚Äôt even get as much page time as they should‚Äôve. They deserved more page time. I mean, if you‚Äôre going to have them talking, give them a POV as least. They could‚Äôve told us about their own history.There were also some language choices that were made that felt odd in a fantasy setting.‚ÄúPersonally, I‚Äôm not arguing with their logic, just enjoying the view‚Ä¶respectfully, of course‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄúSo. Freaking. Beautiful.‚Äù‚ÄúHoly. Fuckin. Hot.‚ÄùNo one talks like that in a fantasy world. üòíYou know damn well some of this lingo doesn‚Äôt belong here. It‚Äôs so embarrassing and a testament to bad writing and bad editing.To top it all off, I still don‚Äôt know whether this was adult, new adult or YA fantasy. I couldn‚Äôt tell you. Goodreads has them all listed. Clearly, everyone is confused.In conclusion, all of this to say that this brand of poorly written, poorly developed fantasy story is just not for me. This book was not for me. I had a really difficult time immersing myself into the story.The ending was somewhat interesting, but by that point I was skim-reading. And I don‚Äôt care about this book enough to continue on with the series. I want to forget I ever read it.I‚Äôm avoiding all hyped books for the foreseeable future. üò™üíî'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '0/5‚≠êÔ∏èüòç OMG THIS IS THE (second) WORST BOOK IVE EVER READ IN MY ENTIRE EXISTENCE!!!ü•∞I‚Äôve posted my iron flame review!! You can go read it if you liked this one :)Violet Sorrengail. Get it? SOARING-GALE BECAUSE DRAGONS SOAR ON GALES üßçüèª\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è THATS SO CLEVER.She‚Äôs like so badass because she‚Äôs like so dainty and like so small and has insert name chronic illness which makes her so badass and a really good candidate for a WAR SCHOOL. She is totally not a self-insert of the author because unlike the author she doesn‚Äôt have blonde hair, she has ultra special brown hair that turns a really rare silver as she gets older. (Because hair pigment works like thatü§≠)She‚Äôs also so super really fast because she‚Äôs SOO petite and small and little and fragile.And also the love interest is SOO much bigger than her and he‚Äôs the most powerful darkness-wielding highlord‚Äîoh sorry I mean dragon rider at the academy.because Violet being the daughter of the literal leader of the school wasn‚Äôt enough, she also gets a super mega rare giant black dragon AND a never-before-seen golden useless ass feathertailed baby dragon that has the ability to manipulate time. And don‚Äôt worry, Violet can summon lightning just in case you were concerned that Mare Barrow was the most obnoxious lightning wielder.Rebecca Yarrows is such a good writer üòç all of her world building and info dumps are so unbearable to read!! Plus her writing is entirely YA and juvenile except for the horrific car crash level sex scenes that happen 80% into the book. What a slay!!All of her characters make me want to rip my eyeballs outü•∞ but especially Xaden because he‚Äôs so tortured and scary and so much bigger than our poor baby fragile pathetic paper-boned protagonist Violet soaring-gale.The enemies to lovers is also so well done!! They were literally never even enemiesüòç and I didn‚Äôt once believe they felt anything other than the most surface level lust for the otherü§≠Also why the fuck did Yarrows decide that when the dragons fuck that their riders also get really horny? That was information I did not ever need.The world building was so amazingly perfect!! I loved how she info dumped entire paragraphs of exposition and random facts onto us, but still never managed to outline how the actual school worked or why the fuck the gryphons couldn‚Äôt just be incinerated by the giant ass dragons with literal magic!!!!üòçOh, I also really enjoyed how the single black character with any personality was not only bisexual but hyper sexual and slept around with everyone!!! It was really great how Rhiannon was sidelined the entire novel so that Violet could also be useless!I also love how we don‚Äôt get to know anything about any of the side characters because Violet is too concerned with fucking Xaden!! ü•µThe nickname of ‚ÄúViolence‚Äù for Violet, the character that literally did not kill a single person until the 75% mark also made a lot of sense!! I‚Äôm so glad she was at a war school and wasn‚Äôt required to kill a single person or even ever actually train without cheating her way through by poisoning her opponents!! She will totally not die in actual combat when she can‚Äôt sneak random ass made-up poisons into her opponents‚Äô meals!! üòùI think it‚Äôs also so inspiring how Violet‚Äôs tiny 90 pound frame literally could not support swinging an 11 pound sword, but the dragons did not murder her for being weak (her words not mine) because she was so strong mentally because she complained about being in pain (despite claiming to be used to pain?) and so delicate and fragile all the time!! ü§©Also let‚Äôs just not talk about how Violet totally plays into the ‚Äútoxic perseverance‚Äù trope by actively ignoring the symptoms and effects her disability has on her body and powers through everything because she‚Äôs ‚Äúused to pain‚Äù!! That‚Äôs so good and such a good example to set <3It could have been interesting if Violet actually found ways to accommodate for her weaknesses/disadvantages that made sense, but clearly Yarros doesn‚Äôt actually give a fuck so she didn‚Äôt bother. The only example we have of this is a saddle which I‚Äôm sorry is stupid as fuck because why was everyone not already using saddles?? Did Miss Rebecca ever look into how fucking uncomfortable it can be not use a saddle or padding while riding horses much less consider how painful it might be to ride a giant, roughly scaled DRAGON that is FLYING THROUGH THE SKY?? üôàThis book was so incredibleüòç I can‚Äôt believe booktok didn‚Äôt force this down everyone‚Äôs throats sooner!! It was so great to read this horrendous amalgamation of shitty world building, horrifically atrocious writing, and one dimensional characters with a nonsensical plot and a underdeveloped romance!!Legitimately the worst book I‚Äôve ever read.

I had so much uni work to do, but I still flew through it. The author wasted no time ‚Äì she made a fast-paced, action-packed, well established fantasy world. I love how we got introduced to bits and aspects of this world slowly, she really KNEW how to world build, how to ease us into this complicated setting. AT EVERY POINT OF THIS BOOK I knew what was going on, who I was rooting for, what are the aims of the particular scene. And you, my fellow fantasy readers, know how that doesn‚Äôt always happen. Like I said in the updates, EVERY SINGLE PAGE WAS A PLOT POINT and no fill-ins. I hate it when writers drag the story, you can really tell when they do that, and fantasy authors are for some reason prone to doing that. This wasn‚Äôt such a book. It‚Äôs not that long (around 400 pages) and I wasn‚Äôt bored in any scene. I love how the story intensified towards the end, but the stakes were high throughout the WHOLE THING.THAT Xaden CHAPTER ATEATEATEATE, I LOVED IT SO MUCH!AND THAT PLOT TWIST IT ENDED ON, I COULD NEVER EVEN IMAGINE THAT HAPPENING! UGH, I can‚Äôt wait for the next book.THE BADI said it before, WILL SAY IT AGAIN, this is the most formulaic book I‚Äôve read in my life. You know when popular musicians make songs SPECIFICALLY so they can become popular on TikTok and you SOMEHOW ALWAYS KNOW. Yes, this was that, but for books. You can really tell the author used EVERY SINGLE TROPE she knows people love and will eat up and put it in her book (enemies to lovers, mated pairs, the whole rebellion trope, I‚Äôm the chosen one but I don‚Äôt want to be that blablabla), I just couldn‚Äôt get past that fact. Before reading this book I saw a few posts saying how this book is similar to ACOTAR. When I just started it, I didn‚Äôt really see the resemblance, but THEN I GOT IT. Dain is SOOOO Tamlin coded, Xaden is basically Rhysand, again the rebellion thing, THE MATES THING (god I hate that so much). I wouldn‚Äôt call this a carbon copy of ACOTAR, but you can‚Äôt tell me it wasn‚Äôt loosely inspired by it (for the sole purpose of satisfying booktok).This was in no way original, and that‚Äôs the number one thing I didn‚Äôt like about this book. There wasn‚Äôt a single thing happening, a plot point, a scene, a character trait, that I haven‚Äôt seen before. This plays into this being EXTREMELY FORMULAIC.For those who read it, is it just me? (I know it isn‚Äôt)THE DRAGONS WERE SO FUNNY. I‚Äôm sorry, I didn‚Äôt like the dragons. I liked them individually (as almost characters) BUT they WERE IN NO WAY WELL WRITTEN. They‚Äôre supposed to be these mysterious, dangerous, sacred creatures, but Violet‚Äôs dragon says the word FUCK at one point. I LAUGHED SO MUCH, HAD ME ON THE FLOOR.THE CHARACTERSUgh, they‚Äôre supposed to be adults, but they‚Äôre SO YA CODED. You can‚Äôt tell me Violet is 20.Surprisingly, I liked the protagonists, but individually. They‚Äôre both flawed, but also with a sense of moral, a great combination of characteristics. However, them as a couple, not really. The banter was there in the beginning but then it just evaporated. They went from being enemies to LOVERS THE PLANET HASN‚ÄôT SEEN so quickly. They were enemies for a good chunk of pages, I must admit that, but the change was in no way gradual (pls go to the Mariana Zapata slow burn school k thanks).(And also, Violet was so desperate with the L word, GIRLIE STAND UP!!!)The spice was good ngl (had me kicking my feet lol)I LOVED THE SIDE CHARACTERS. RHIANNON AND LIAM (sorrows sorrows prayers) HAVE MY HEART.FINAL THOUGHTSThis was a fast-paced, highly enjoyable first book in the series I will for sure continue reading when the next installment is out. It wasn‚Äôt very memorable and won‚Äôt make the FAVORITES list, but I still had fun reading. I‚Äôm leaving room for improvement.Is it overhyped, tell me in the comments???

Violet has him so tightly wrapped around her finger and they can‚Äôt even begin to understand the depths of it‚Ä¶one would think the romance would be my hyper fixation for this book but it‚Äôs not even that (not only that.) it‚Äôs the fucking dragons! the way they are described, have personalities of their own, the way they always check and roast Violet had me LOLing and giddy. the bonds they have with their riders felt as real as oxygen in the air! üòÆ\u200düí®some quotes that aren‚Äôt spoilery but still had me barking like a dog in heat:üëπ‚Äúheat rushes through every vein, wakes every nerve ending.

My issues are not with these genres. My issues are with books that read as clumsy, horny (and not in a fun camp way), and unpolished. Which in my Personal Opinion(tm)!!!!!!!!!! this book is.It's pretty stock standard commercial horny hetero fiction. That's fine. Can't please everyone. I'll be totally honest: if you don't care that much about quality of writing and want an easy het romance-fantasy novel √† la Cassandra Clare et al. (nothing wrong with that!), you may enjoy this. It's not my thing, though, and I can't recommend it if you want a decent wholemeal fantasy novel to sink your teeth into. **I found this disappointing and I‚Äôm frankly shocked it has such glowing early reviews.To be fair, my disappointment is partly caused by the misleading blurb and ARC marketing. The blurb implies a high stakes military fantasy set at a war college for dragon riders; this put me in mind of Temeraire, The Poppy War, or even elements of The Hunger Games. Romance is mentioned - ‚Äútraitors will become allies‚Ä¶ or lovers‚Äù - but it‚Äôs certainly not implied to be wholly a romance novel.I saw on the author‚Äôs instagram that this is being marketed as a ‚Äúnew adult fantasy‚Äù - if 'new adult' just means ‚Äòlacking the sophistication of genre fiction but can‚Äôt be marketed as YA romance because of sex scenes‚Äô‚Ä¶ then, sure, call it 'new adult'.All the characters - even supposed high-ranking military figures - speak like millennials from the year 2023. Why was the word ‚Äòvibe‚Äô used so many times? As in, ‚Äòhis vibe is weird‚Äô. But in other ways the setting recalls medieval Europe? Who edited this???I would not have picked this up if the marketing more accurately reflected the content. It‚Äôs 100% a romance novel in the vein of Cassandra Claire, Sarah J. Maas, the Divergent series; any genuine stakes are basically subplot to the central romance. The oh-so-important ~tension~ could be resolved by just‚Ä¶ talking to one another? Most other world building elements are underdeveloped & confusing, full of plot holes, and everyone‚Äôs dialogue is set up to give the protagonist & ~dark~ love interest perfect Marvel-esque quips and one-liners. I get that this is a popular thing but to me it lacks sophistication and polish of contemporary fantasy :-)Also, my certified transgender opinion (tm) is that the inclusion of a random nonbinary side character was disingenuous and definitely tokenism, lol.The reason for two stars instead of one is because I found the representation of the protagonist's disability - and how it was navigated in such physically demanding settings - genuinely interesting.All in all, this, to me, read like a semi-edited fanfic. If that‚Äôs your thing, go buckwild. Otherwise, I can‚Äôt really recommend it. The blurb is pretty misleading, imo. Expect a YA romance novel.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '""Decide, Violet. Are you going to die a scribe? Or live as a rider?""Oh, this is good. I see now why y\'all love it so much.IfFourth Wingwere a drug, I\'d be an addict. It grabbed me so thoroughly from the very first moment and refused to let go. I was fully immersed, I didn\'t want to sleep, didn\'t want to eat. I just wanted to inhale it as fast as I could. And honestly, isn\'t this why we read, for this exact feeling?The action begins right on the first page and never lets up. There was no onerous worldbuilding, no endless backgrounds or introductions. We just seamlessly slip into the world of Navarre and Violet Sorrengail. Every time I get the itch to read fantasy, the one thing that holds me back is how much worldbuilding I would have to endure just to get to the good parts. But no such issues here. The good parts start right at the beginning.Is this the most original story? No. Is this the most well written? Also no. (Don\'t kill me for saying that, all you rabid fans.) In fact, the dialogue has me cringing at times, with its penchant for f-bombs as emphasis and its often basic but slightly pompous back-and-forth that only teenagers can pull off. I guess in that way, it is true to its characters since they\'re all not much older than teenagers.But slight criticisms aside, this story is executed to perfection. It takes several well-trodden tropes and not only cohesively blends them together, but also manages to squeeze every ounce of entertainment out of them along the way. And I\'m not above being entertained.This is my first real foray into the romantasy genre that\'s got everyone aflutter. And I can see the appeal. Fantasy is a bit of an adrenaline rush and so is romance, so blending the two together is really the perfect symbiosis. Of course you\'d want your hero to fight hard in a war between good and evil. And it totally makes sense that they would love hard too if they could die any day. And if the object of desire is one\'s enemy instead of one\'s friend? Even better.I\'m a little late to theFourth Wingparty, and there\'s good reason. I was certain this was a duology (don\'t ask me why I thought this), so I figured if I just held off a little bit, I could bam my way through both books without having to stop and deal with the inevitable anguish of waiting for the next book.

In the intervening years since reading this, my feelings on the matter have not changed nor have I desired to continue. Please refrain from commenting about how I need to continue the series or that I did not understand the book. I receive too many of those comments and I\'m tired of replying the same thing over and over again. This review is for me first and foremost, not you. Please move on if you do not like my take.)Me to Sarah J Maas:""Do you lie awake at night to come up with all your witty replies for the following day?""Oh dear, this is awful.The WritingThe title of this book is stupid. It\'s stupid and flashy and unrelated to the actual content of the book. It\'s solely for the ~wow~ factor. The quotable line, ""I love you... Thorns and all"" is wholely ineffective because ""thorns"" had not been established as a motif and was only used in that context in that very scene, more than halfway through the book. The word ""thorn"" was only used a grand total of 9 times in this book. The original Beauty and the Beast story had established rose motifs‚Äîyou can\'t borrow good writing, even for a retelling. That\'s just lazy.The writing itself was inconsistent and poorly done.I pushed and pulled, but the mud was too slick, and held fast.Are you aware of the definition of ""slick"", Sarah J Maas? I do not think it means what you think it means.Besides that, Amarantha\'s hair drastically changed color after about 90 pages:Her red-gold hairHer black hairWhich is it, Maas? It can\'t be both unless she has unmentioned magical hair dyeing abilities.The atmosphere and the opening chapter were excellent and I was intrigued by the idea that was offered me, but the actual book did not deliver at all.This next point is a spoiler, but because I am disgusted with Sarah J Maas for including this, I amnotgoing to mark it as such, since everyone should know what kind of morals this book is supporting before they read it especially when they are as filthy and vulgar as this was.The attemptedrapeof Feyre by Tamlin was brushed off as no more than a mere romantic, steamy encounter to further their lukewarm love story. The only conclusions I can logically draw from this are all rather victim blamey, tbh‚Äîshe was warned several times to stay inside with the doors locked until dawn, but she leaves her room not once but twice before dawn because she ~wants to go to the party~ and then later, after she almost gets gang-raped and is saved and then creeped out by Rhysand the sociopath, she thinks she is totally safe to go eat a bunch of cookies because, well the drums stopped, so it\'s probably okay now, and then she getssexually assaultedby Tamlin, who wasstill high with lust magic.I was about to pass out when he grabbed me, so fast I didn\'t see anything until he had me pinned against the wall.""Let go,"" I said as evenly as I could.I [pushed] him away. He grabbed my hands again and bit my neck. I cried out as his teeth clamped onto the tender spot where my neck met my shoulder. I couldn\'t move‚ÄîI couldn\'t think.Before, during and after theattack, she\'s thinking,Wow, he\'s really hot. I\'m kinda uncomfortable with this, but I guess it\'s okay that he\'s drunk on lust magic, because I wanted to sleep with him anyway. That is avery wrong and dangerous way of thinking.No matter what, it isneverokay foranyoneto make someone else sexually uncomfortable or afraid, especially when they\'ve given verbal disapproval. This entire scene left a bad taste in my mouth.And then there\'s Rhysand\'s behavior. He repeatedly violates her personal space and comfort, drugging her and forcing her to""dance""for him in front of a large crowd for weeks on end after stripping her all but naked. Like all Fae males, apparently, he uses brute force to get her to comply with his sexual wishes.""But he didn\'t actually touch her; he kept his hands just on her waist!"" you say. Yeah, but did she say he could touch her at all? Did she actively encourage him to touch her? No, she did not.I pulled away, but his hands were like shackles.I would not have such an issue with this if Sarah J Maas didn\'t give the impression that she supports such behavior. That is what I find unconscionable.Besides that, the plot made no sense, even after exposition-Alis gave us the lowdown‚Äîin fact, it almost madelesssense then. It was cheesy and clich√© and frankly, boring. The ""riddle"" was extremely easy and only proved that Feyre is an absolute idiot with no logical abilities, as I was able to figure it out before Amarantha had even finished saying it, and I\'m notoriously bad at riddles.The sex scenes were almost Empire of Storms levels of bad, cringey, and gross. I think Sarah J Maas doesn\'t know what YA means and isn\'t aware she\'s actually writing for NA.The WorldbuildingThe Fae were, for one thing, almost exactly the same (primarily in appearance and personality) to the ones in the Throne of Glass series, and tbh I was disappointed. They\'re not even cleverly unique faeries. They\'re just Tolkien-esque elves that are actually vampires: fangs and biting, immortality, aetherial beauty, animalistic tendencies, superiority complex. They don\'t have any distinct differences from humans in their thought processes or emotional capacities‚Äîonly the same degree of variety that exists in humans.The religious system and creation story was very interesting and I really liked that aspect.The CharactersFaerie aka Belle: Sarah J Maas decided to try something new and have a first-person fixed perspective, but it didn\'t really work, because Feyre was a bland complacent character without much substance passed the surface level, and most of the interesting action took place where she couldn\'t see it. She suffered, like Celaena did in Crown of Midnight, from what I call Nehemia syndrome: the character that the MC has grown to trust, despite obvious suspicious behavior, turns out to be manipulative, and yet the MC completely overlooks that fact in favor of idolization of their lying friend. In this case, everyone in Prythian is keeping secrets from her and after almost getting her questions answered by the Suriel, Feyre decides to ""Stay with the High Lord. He will keep you safe,"" and just completely forgets that she wants answers about the blight. Also, whereas Belle left the Beast in the original story because her father was in mortal danger, in this book, Feyre leaves becauseTamlin impies that she\'s gonna get ganked by Rhys or Amarantha, the evil Faerie Queen.She is not an active protagonist. Also, her painting skills aren\'t a part of her characterization; it just feels tacked on to make her ~cool~ and ~unique~Tampon aka the Beast: I don\'t even care about this guy tbh. He\'s a confusing character who just feels like a Chaol-Rowan merge on steroids. He\'s violent, obsessive, and abusive, but also sweet, understanding, and caring, because that\'s not a contradiction. There\'s a difference between a complex character and a poorly written character.Lucien aka Lumiere/Cogsworth (his steampunk eye suggests Cogsworth but his personality suggests Lumiere): So apparently he ""hates"" Feyre even though I almost shipped them more since they consistently had better chemistry than her and Tammy, and that\'s saying a lot, because they didn\'t have chemistry.exposition-Alis aka Mrs Potts: She was okay. Just okay. She was fine.Reese\'s Cups aka also the Beast and kinda Gaston too: Is he supposed to be her love interest for the rest of the series or something, because the fan art definitely suggests that, but, uh, did everyone forget that he\'s a dangeroussociopathwith a history of violence?? He has no regard for her emotional well-being and sees her body as literally nothing beyond a sexual plaything. He\'s a horrible person.Amarantha: Why did there have to be a ""big bad evil Faerie Queen"" in this at all? There\'s already one in the Throne of Glass series and I can only take so much female-against-female hate from a supposedly feminist fantasy writer. Amarantha was bland and predictable, and her motivations were extremely surface-level.Her fam: Nesta was like, supposed to have some kind of implied character arc but lol it wasn\'t very good. Elain was nice and I liked her. The dad was okay, I guess. Pretty forgettable tbhIsaac Hale aka fake-out Gaston: This character wasn\'t important at all, but I just wanted to say that I think this is the dumbest name choice in a high fantasy book that I\'ve ever seen.Isaac Hale?? Really, Sarah J Maas? Really? That\'s the Jason of fantasy names. This is a the-guy-who-went-to-high-school-with-my-older-sister kind of name. It\'s not a fantasy name.ConclusionWhile I managed to read it fairly quickly, I had to dnf it for several days before deciding to trudge through. It was horrendous. I may pick up the sequel at some point, idk, but for now, from what I predict and understand from various spoilers I\'ve encountered on the internet, I don\'t really care about this series very much. Frankly, it\'s not good.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""That was both horrible and incredible at the same time, and my thoughts are a whirlwind.Note: The first part of this review is spoiler-free, but the second half is most definitely not. The spoilery section is blocked off by siren emojis (üö®). Skip to the end for bonus content, including an ACOTAR rap written by yours truly.This is the story of a mortal girl, Feyre, who kills a Fae in the woods one day. She‚Äôs whisked away to Prythian, home of the Fae, where she will live the rest of her days as punishment for murdering the wolf.Whoever said this was a Beauty and the Beast retelling is clearly not okay. This is far from a retelling, becauseit takes all the important themes outand leaves just the bare plotline:1. The Beast (Tamlin) is not ugly or even a beast at all. He just has a mask stuck to his face forever as part of a curse that I will get into more in the spoilery section.2. We are not aware of any good reason for Tamlin to keep Feyre until the very end, and it‚Äôs still a flimsy reason (this relates back to the curse).The problem with the plot is that the foreshadowing is so faint. The plot in the beginning and up until the 75 percent mark makes no sense at all. Tamlin takes Feyre to live in luxury, with good food and nice clothes and freedom, because she killed his fellow Fae? It‚Äôs just nonsensical.How is that a punishment at all?She no longer has to care for her spoiled sisters, she‚Äôs away from the poor village.However, it does make sense in the end, but Feyre is very naive for believing all of this. Something doesn‚Äôt add up. People who DNF this book will be very confused indeed.In Beauty and the Beast, we know of the curse beforehand, so we can find a good reason for the Beast to be kind to Belle. But Tamlin? It‚Äôs a mystery.So anyway, Feyre gets taken to a land of luxury to live out the rest of her days in comfort as ‚Äúpunishment,‚Äù but she‚Äôs still not happy because for some reason she misses her sisters, even though they treated her like dirt.She falls in love with Tamlin, which was expected because he‚Äôs not a Beast. There‚Äôs no barrier to overcome here.She isn‚Äôt forced to look past his ugly exterior because he has no ugly exterior.Along the way, another Fae named Lucien conveniently reveals everything Feyre needs to know right before it happens. This is supposed to be foreshadowing? I think? But in the end, he makes things so easy for Feyre and there‚Äôs no conflict whatsoever.The only problems arise from Feyre‚Äôs own stupidity.Their exchanges basically go like this:Lucien: The Suriel are super dangerous and even hard for the Fae to trap so stay away.Feyre: *makes simple snare* *kills chicken* oOpS I caught one, what a coincidence!!Everything is far too easy for Feyre.She‚Äôs supposed to be a responsible hunter, but instead she makes stupid, reckless decisions that don‚Äôt line up with her character. She follows an illusion of her father despite being told it‚Äôs fake, she goes outside on Fire Night, she chases the Suriel, she goes after Tamlin‚Ä¶ etc.If you tell her not to do something, she will do it.Lucien: Stay in your room, it‚Äôs dangerous.Tamlin: Stay in your room, it‚Äôs dangerous.Literally everyone ever: Stay in your room, it‚Äôs dangerous.Feyre: *gets a midnight snack*Feyre is trying to figure out the details of this blight that‚Äôs supposed to be taking over Prythian, but luckily for her, Lucien and Tamlin give everything away with no struggle whatsoever.The result is thatthe danger does not feel genuine.It feels like a cheesy way to add angst to the relationship between Feyre and Tamlin.Speaking of Tamlin, everyone hates him so much but he‚Äôs such a sweetheart. I know that he gets worse in ACOMAF, but there‚Äôs nothing wrong with him in this book. He may be a little bland, but he‚Äôs much better than Rhysand. More details in the spoilery section.And then we have the writing, which is just bad. ‚Äú...‚Äù is used in every other sentence, the poor em dashes are abused, and Feyre‚Äôs bones bark. A lot. Like, every time she falls down, she describes her barking bones. And what‚Äôs up with the phrase ‚Äúmy bowels turned watery?‚Äù It‚Äôs used at least twice and I don‚Äôt like it at all. This is notShatter Me.üö®üö®üö®SPOILER ALERTüö®üö®üö®So, what‚Äôs up with Amarantha?I really do like her. She‚Äôs a compelling villain because she‚Äôs (somewhat) realistic. Sure, she tortures people for fun, but her backstory makes this seem (somewhat) reasonable. (Somewhat.)Basically, she kidnaps Tamlin and Feyre runs after them because she has no self-preservation instinct. She challenges Amarantha, and in return, she is given three trials. If she wins them all, she and Tamlin will be free and his powers will return. If she loses‚Ä¶ well, Amarantha keeps saying that there wouldn‚Äôt be enough left of Feyre to burn.However, Amarantha gives her a different option. She could solve a riddle.This is when things go downhill. First of all, why would Amarantha bet all her power and might on a simple riddle? It‚Äôs not even that hard to solve. The riddle itself is bad. The rhyming pattern isn‚Äôt great. And worst of all, the answer?It‚Äôs love.The answer is love.How does this make sense? Amarantha is a brutal, sadistic villain, so why would she write such a cliche, cheesy riddle?She should have made it oddly specific so Feyre would never get it.Anyway, Feyre answers it correctly at the last minute, Amarantha loses all her power, and Tamlin kills her.It was far too easy.Moving onto Rhysand. I hate him with a burning passion. He‚Äôs a greasy, crusty, dusty, musty old man. I can‚Äôt believe Feysand is the endgame ship. I‚Äôm suing. This is ridiculous. I don‚Äôt understand how people love him. He‚Äôs abusive, uncomfy, and weird.People keep telling me that I will love Rhysand in ACOMAF and hate Tamlin. First of all, I highly doubt it.Second of all,if you have to rely on making one character a villain just to get people to like the other character, that‚Äôs bad writing.Finally, the curse is so specific and random. Tamlin has to fall in love with a mortal girl who hates the Fae so much that she killed one in cold blood, and he has to wear a mask, and she can't know it's a curse.üö®üö®üö®END OF SPOILERSüö®üö®üö®In conclusion: Feyre is an idiot, Tamlin is precious, and Rhysand deserves to rot in a hole.Also, I wrote a rap.

DNF at 30% because I just got fed up with things moving at a snail\'s pace and NOT MAKING SENSE AT ALL. This was one of the most uncompelling versions ofBeauty and the Beastthat I have ever read. The writing is nothing outstanding, there was nothing that moved me. I feltCruel Beautyamong other B&B retellings I\'ve read this year and last have done a far superior job at moving me emotionally.Look, I\'m sure by the end of the book, all the things tie together and everything\'s just dandy and things will make sense, and I\'d be like ""ooooooh, so that\'s why ____."" Me, I don\'t care. Ain\'t nobody got time for that. I have so many questions and I\'m just fed up. This is not a retelling of Beauty and the Beast. This is a book about a girl who gets to live an easy life with a guy who\'s implied to be a gorgeous Fae underneath his mask.The original story makes sense: here\'s roughly how it goes. Handsome prince is cursed to be ugly unless he gets a chick to fall for him. Flash forward, there\'s Belle\'s dad. Belle\'s dad wanders into Beast\'s castle and touches his stuff. Beast doesn\'t like the fact that Belle\'s dad touched his stuff. Beast is going to kill Belle\'s dad unless he gets Beast some pussy. Belle\'s valiantly steps in to save dad, Beast is as nice to her as much as a hairy ugly, self-conscious, socially ostracized monster can be. Belle is treated like a princess because Beast really, really fucking needs her to save him and his people before the curse runs out!There\'s a reason Belle is treated like the queen! Things make sense! They have to learn to trust one another. Things are slowly developed an built over time. There is a hideous beast who is scarred emotionally, and a beauty who needs to look past the exterior. There is a point. Not so with this book.Things are far, far too easy with this book.Now here\'s this version of Beauty and the Beast,a retelling that tries to be bad-ass and fails completely,from the little that I have read.There\'sFeyrewho has a pretty crappy life with an absentminded, worthless, spineless dad, and two of the most bitchy, ungrateful sisters in the entire world. She slaves for them, she hunts food for them, she works her ass off for them. Without her, their family would starve. They don\'t care. I feel some pity for her, but she acts like so much of a martyr that there\'s only so much I can take.While hunting one day, Feyre kills a wolf, well, surprise, surprise, that wolf turns out to be a Fae in disguise. In return for this kill, Feyre is taken by a wolf (who\'s a Fae in disguise) away from her family.‚ÄúWhat is the payment the Treaty requires?‚ÄùHis eyes didn‚Äôt leave my face as he said, ‚ÄúA life for a life. Any unprovoked attacks on faerie-kind by humans are to be paid only by a human life in exchange.‚ÄùA life for a life!Oh, no! Is she going to die?! That\'s what a life for a life means, right?WRONG. Feyre is taken off to magical Fairyland to live in luxury for the rest of her life while her family is taken care of back in their little village.‚ÄúSome would say it‚Äôs unwise to insult a Fae in his home,‚Äù Tamlin ground out. ‚ÄúSome would say you should be grateful for me finding you before another one of my kind came to claim the debt, for sparing your life and then offering you the chance to live in comfort.‚ÄùSo what?!Why?!This makes no sense at all.Feyre kills one of their kind. A beloved brother.In exchange, there isabsolutely no punishment whatsoever. She gets to live in a fantastically fabulous castle, waited on by servants. She gets beautiful clothes and delicious food.Another useless answer. I dug into my breakfast, savoring each rich sip of tea, and she slipped into the bathing chamber. When I was done eating and bathing, I refused Alis‚Äôs offer and dressed myself in another exquisite tunic‚Äîthis one of purple so deep it could have been black.Clearly there is some kind of a setup involving The Treaty, since there seems to be a lot of secrecy between the Fae...but wait, whatever information she wants, the Fae reveals...they\'re revealing their own weakness to Feyre, who is constantly plotting her own escape.It doesn\'t make any sense!‚ÄúThere is ‚Ä¶ a sickness in these lands. Across Prythian. There has been for almost fifty years now. It is why this house and these lands are so empty: most have left. The blight spreads slowly, but it has made magic act ‚Ä¶ strangely. My own powers are diminished due to it. These masks‚Äù‚Äîhe tapped on his‚Äî‚Äúare the result of a surge of it that occurred during a masquerade forty-nine years ago. Even now, we can‚Äôt remove them.‚ÄùOver and over and over,the Fae reveal their secrets to her, including one that might help her escape.‚ÄúSo there are faeries who will actually answer any question if you trap them?‚Äù Maybe they‚Äôd know how to free me from the Treaty‚Äôs terms.‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he said tightly. ‚ÄúThe Suriel. But they‚Äôre old and wicked, and not worth the danger of going out to find them.And then pretty much the next chapter, she goes out AND IMMEDIATELY FINDS THESE MYSTERIOUS CREATURES. WHAT THE FUCK.I do not like it when things come so easily to a main character, and everything comes easily to Feyre. There is no consequence whatsoever to her actions. There is no punishment to her deed of killing. The Fae are supposed to hate her...it doesn\'t feel like it, because she is ""inconsequential."" In fact, they\'re more of her playmates than her wardens. The Fae seem to have no other things to do besides play with her and hunt with her.‚ÄúMy morning work was postponed,‚Äù he said. Indeed, his usual tunic was off, the baldric gone, and the sleeves of his white shirt had been rolled up to the elbows to reveal tanned forearms corded with muscle. ‚ÄúIf you want a ride across the grounds‚Äîif you‚Äôre interested in your new ‚Ä¶ residence, I can take you.‚ÄùAnd teach her how to read and write...because Feyre cannot read or write, an ironic twist to the Disney Belle\'s love for reading.‚ÄúI could help you write to them, if that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre in here.‚ÄùFeyre is irreverent, ungrateful and insulting to her wardens...in a way that gets her no punishment whatsoever.‚ÄúDo you ever stop being such a prick?‚Äù I snapped back.Dead‚Äîreally, truly, I should have been dead for that.But Lucien grinned at me. ‚ÄúMuch better.‚ÄùAs I said, I\'m sure this book improves in the end, but from what I\'ve read, this book makes no sense, the writing is emotionless, the characters are flat, the main character unrealistic, and I do not care to continue.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""INITIAL REACTION: WILL UPDATE WITH REVIEW LATER BUT KNOW I LOVED THIS.

I started reading it as soon as it became available and the array of positive reviews from my friends and strangers alike made me feel sure I would love it. But I didn\'t. It is possible I expected all the wrong things fromA Court of Thorns and Roses, and maybe my review can prevent others from doing the same.Here\'s what I expected:an intricate fantasy world, supernatural politics and alliances, fast-paced action, a sensual romance - perhaps similar toCruel Beautyand otherBeauty and the Beastretellings, and a flawed but likable heroine.But this book is, if you ask me, nothing more or less thansoftcore erotica. Which is fine, if that\'s what you\'re looking for.I personally thought that the fantasy aspect felt like trimmings around a story that was all about a romance between Feyre (the narrator) and Tamlin (a High Lord of the Fae). There are some titillating scenes where Tamlin bites Feyre\'s neck and they have sex - undoubtedly the best bits of the book and I won\'t pretend I didn\'t feel a little hot under the collar myself. But the ""ancient wicked shadow"" promised in the blurb is only really a source of more romantic angst for Feyre and Tamlin.However, I *do* like a good romance as much as anyone, so there are other reasons this book didn\'t quite work for me. In order to express what I mean, I\'m going to compareA Court of Thorns and RosestoCruel Beauty, which is, in my opinion, a better book.In CB, I felt the chemistry between Nyx and Ignifex as soon as their loaded banter started to fill the pages. They were sexy together, Ignifex was an evil ruler (which was a real problem for their relationship) with blood-red eyes, and the supernatural part of the book was creepy, weird and completely unique. Despite enjoying the actual non-PG scenes inA Court of Thorns and Roses, I never felt any real chemistry between Feyre and Tamlin or any realistic challenge to their relationship.What makesBeauty and the Beastsuch a compelling romance?One that demands to be told over and over again in so many different ways? I\'ll tell you what it is: it\'s the obstacles, the challenges, the improbability...how can a young woman come to love an ugly beast?We ask.I\'ll prove it\'s possible!The author replies. That\'s why readers fall in love with the beast again and again, even when he is furry and has horns like the Disney version. I loved the Disney beast.And that badass fox in Robin Hood so it\'s possible I have issues.Tamlin is not a beast.‚ÄúEven as he bit out the words, I couldn‚Äôt ignore the sheer male beauty of that strong jaw, the richness of his golden-tan skin.‚ÄùOh my, how could a poor young woman ever love a pretty-faced, golden-haired, completely not evil Fae prince? How weird.Maas is a good writer and the beginning - before Feyre is taken to the Fae world - made me believe a great book was on the way. When Maas writes action, she writes actionreallywell. But there was far too little of it in this book. It came in behind the descriptions of beautiful Fae men and the Fae palace.In short:It just wasn\'t nasty enough.In truth, this felt more like an extended Cinderella retelling than what it was supposed to be. A girl lives in poverty and looks after her rather annoying sisters until one day she is swept up by a prince who takes her to his beautiful palace (after about three chapters). I just find it hard to recommend this when I thinkCruel Beautyis similar and yet so much better.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Tumblr'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""4.45/5 ‚≠êFull review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolfüê∫This book‚Äôs mood song match ‚ÄìFix You by Coldplaymum: *enters kitchen at 3 am* What the hell are you doing?me: *with a bowl of ice cream in one hand and ACOTAR in the other* I'm starting another SJM seriesmum: Hang on, I have a bottle of vodka here somewhere*And if this is not some relatable shit when facing Sarah J. Maas‚Äôs books then I don‚Äôt know what to tell you anymore. You puzzle me.So, there you go ‚Äì another great universe erected by SJM just in front of our humble eyes. She is building her own fucking multiverse and we are here to witness the power of a goddess at work. I will make three sacrifices for that.This is, so far, for me, the best Beauty and the Beast reimagination.HER EXECUTION STYLE IS THE AIR TO MY LUNGS.And this one is not even the best of her works.‚ÄúMagic ‚Äì everything was magic, and it broke my heart.‚ÄùMainly, our action is happening at the Spring Court where our main character finds herself in front of a new intriguing life. Or at least as intriguing as a Court of flowery gardens can be.As I always say about SJM‚Äôs books,the characters are the ones who make the action. It‚Äôs like they are the very engine of a plot.I kind of likeFeyre. She definitely has her own personal issues, mainly because she is broken and lonely and desperate to beat her status. She is human and miserable, mainly because her family is horrible. Her whole family was created to look like the typical fairytale family ‚Äì an absent coward of a father, an uninterested mother, a sister full of wicked hatred and another one caught up in her own world, sensitive and na√Øve. Until her sisters do something worthy of my affection, I ain‚Äôt changing my mind about them.Lucien(the Emissary of the Spring Court), I must say, I liked from the very beginning, but he somehow managed to grow on me. There was something likeable about him at first and he only proved that to me more as the action went on.Tamlin, the High Lord of the Spring Court, on the other hand, seemed a bit stiff the whole book, even though I sometimes appreciated the occasional softness of his heart.But full-on honesty now ‚Äì thebestthing about this book, the one thing that made it 110% better wasRhysand. He won for this book a full star from me with all of his domineering prick moves. He played the bad boy role so good that my traitorous heart enjoyed him whole. I might have a problem but oh, what a perfect problem he is.‚ÄúHis voice was a lover‚Äôs purr that sent shivers through me, caressing every muscle and bone and nerve.‚ÄùSexy.Rhysand and Feyre certainly have a sort of total chemistry that it seems Feyre doesn‚Äôt have with Tamlin; not even after theysupposedlyfell in love with each other. I don‚Äôt buy that love for more than a second and by the end when everything seemed to try to make me believe their relationship I was still not convinced.I recognise fabulous chemistry when I see one and that ain‚Äôt it. Rhysand, you‚Äôd better act up, love, I have expectations. You‚Äôre more than just a cruel, beautiful ruffian, I know it.There‚Äôs a certain cruelty in this book, so very Maas. I sometimes feel like I‚Äôm reading the words of a psychopath, but then I remind myself how much Ienjoythis cruelty in these books and I temperate myself.That crazy wretch Amarantha is definitely the embodiment of cold murder and torture in this book and this is visible when it comes to how much her actions affect the other characters‚Äô moods and movements. It‚Äôs terribly interesting though to see how terrified all of them can become when facing her.But by the end, there was this sliver of hope that lingered. And that broke the evil to pieces.‚ÄúThis wasn‚Äôt music to dance to ‚Äì it was music to worship, music to feel in the gaps of my soul, to bring me to a place where there was no pain.‚ÄùEven though I think this is not the best of SJM‚Äôs works, I still believe is so very good that just makes you want to know more. It leaves you craving. And in my humble opinion, that‚Äôs a bonus factor in books.All and all, my first step into the ACOTAR universe has been a success. More steps to come. Until I fall in love. Wholly and irrevocably.""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I cannot remember ever being this conflicted over a book. There are parts of A Court of Thorns and Roses I really loved, but a lot of parts I really hated.I went into this book fully expecting to love it. Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite fairy tales, and I was interested to see how SJM made the story her own.First off, my biggest problem with this story was Feyre as a character. I have never been so irritated. Her character development and personality, for the most part, didn\'t make sense to me. She was the caretaker of her entire family for years, supposedly a hunter with a strong survival instinct. And yet, she proceeded to make the stupidest decisions and put herself in danger time and time again. I didn\'t get the sense that she did this out of bravery, but more out of stupidity. It didn\'t mesh with what her character was supposed to be. Examples of these idiotic choices:1. Repeatedly plotting to escape into a faerie land that she knew to be deadly, when she was asleep on the way to the manor and obviously wouldn\'t know her way back to the mortal lands2. Running after the illusion of her CRIPPLED father at NIGHT, when she has been told and witnessed how deceptive fae can be3. Trapping a Suriel with little more than a snare, in the deadly part of the forest, after she has been told, and AGAIN, SEEN how dangerous these creatures are4. Going to Fire Night after being told how dangerous it is, not leaving after being almost raped by 3 faeries, and then proceeding to leave her room AGAIN afterwards5. Drinking the faerie wine at the Solstice, even after Lucien of all people warned her not to6. Leaving the manor when the Suriel flat out TOLD her not to and that she would be safe with Tamlin, and deciding to not mention that to ANYONE before he forced her to leaveIn addition to all of these idiotic choices, she also is incredibly inconsistent. She\'ll go from hating Fae to sympathizing with them to loving them back to fearing them at the drop of a hat. These inconsistencies are probably the most irritating, as there are scenes that I absolutely adore with Feyre, but then she goes back to doing the next pain in the ass thing on the next page.I also found her relationship with Tamlin to be problematic. Yes, I do enjoy problematic things (especially ships from time to time) but there were a lot of things I couldn\'t excuse with them. Again, more inconsistencies in characters\' behavior. Tamlin\'s hot and cold behavior was eventually explained, but not until 70% of the way through the book. It was too little too late. Also,I found the Fire Night scene to be a problem for me. I do enjoy volatile relationships and bad boy characters. But only when we are told from the beginning that one of the characters is ""bad"". Tamlin we are led to believe is a saint, then he bites her and gets possessive, but all is forgiven the next morning. Because he\'s a ""nice guy."" No.The world building I found to be lackluster in a lot of ways. While I really enjoyed the wide variety of Fae creatures we got to see, I thought that a lot of the back story was revealed in a lazy way. Instead of having Feyre figure anything out for herself, important things are told to her through long monologues from a number of characters throughout the book. This happens numerous times.Additionally, few side characters have any development and most felt like blank slates. With that being said, the ones that were developed I adored. Lucien and Rhys saved the book for me in a lot of ways. I found them both to be complex and interesting characters.The last 10-15% of the book saved it for me. I found the plot to finally be interesting, and I found Feyre\'s decisions in those chapters to actually make sense. A lot of things were set up for future books that have me very intrigued, and I\'m looking forward to the rest of the series. Many things that I disliked in this book, may in fact be remedied due to some of the occurrences in this last small section of the book.Overall, I was disappointed by this first installment. While there were elements I really enjoyed, they didn\'t make up for the elements I didn\'t. I\'m hoping future installments will prove to be better.I will also be doing a full video review and spoiler-filled discussion on mychannelin the future if you want to know more of my thoughts.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""If you've ever wondered which literary world would be the best to live in, wonder no longer, cause there's aBookTube Videoto answer that!The Written Review:----------Update - 12/6/19ShouldI cross the insurmountable TBR? Or reread this series again?I think you know the answer----------Here's the original review:Feyre is huntingin the middle of the woods tokeep her useless starving family alive(Hunger Games, anyone?).A chance encounter with a wolf - who wasn't entirely a wolf - leaves Feyreon the wrong end of an ancient treaty.She is forced to go to the fairy realm to live out the remaining years of her human life -no friends, no family and no freedom.‚ÄúHas anyone ever taken care of you?‚Äù he asked quietly.‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I‚Äôd long since stopped feeling sorry for myself about it.At first, she cannot think of anything but escape. Slowly (but surely), she is swept into the fairy realm -in its magic & intrigue, in its danger & hopelessness, and in its wonder & glory.‚ÄúSpring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, Dawn, Day, and Night,‚Äù it mused, as if I hadn‚Äôt even answered. ‚ÄúThe seven Courts of Prythian, each ruled by a High Lord, all of them deadly in their own way. They are not merely powerful‚Äîthey are Power.‚ÄùFeyre lands in the Spring court - which is under amasquerade cursefor nearly fifty years.The court is being attacked by all manner of terrible creatures and there is ablight upon the land.This blight will soon cross to the human realm - threatening everyone Feyre holds dear.The first half sucksbut keep readingThere's no way around it. From page 1 to about 200, Feyre isannoying and obstinate.I nearly put this book down half a dozen times (it was like readingRed Queen).BUT, there was something about it that kept me interested.AND THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT.Because wow. Seriously wow.Midway through the book,things turned around magnificently.It was like a whole new book.Sarah J Maas is a devious little thing.Suddenly, all the plot holes, nonsensical actions of her fairy captors (Tamlin and Lucien) and Feyre's complete idiocy flipped on their heads.Everything makes sense now.I literally could not put this down.Though, and maybe it's just me, butthe Tamlin-Feyre arc felt a bit rushed/forced.Her constant love declarations really had me questioning their relationship. But then again, I had a friend who accidentally spilled the beans on that one.Without giving any spoilers, I sure hope book 2 does acomplete character shifton you-know-who (NOT voldemort) because I amnot pleasedwith the way the love interest was hinted at during the end of the book. (He's such a jerk!)Overall, I amamazedby how much effort Sarah J. Maas put into constructing this story. I'm this close || to rereading the book solely to better appreciate all those little clues that I must have passed over.So, if you pick this up and just aren't feeling it -keep reading- trust me.The Finer Books Club - 2018 Reading Challenge: A book recommended by a friendYouTube|Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Facebook| Snapchat @miranda_reads""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""4.8/5 Stars ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è‚ÄúDon't feel bad for one moment about doing what brings you joy.‚ÄùI'm speechless.

I WANT THE SECOND BOOK IN MY HANDS BUT MY ORDER STILL HASN'T COME. I'M READY TO GO TO FUCKING ENGLAND MYSELF AND PURCHASE IT. KIDS I'M LITERALLY DYING HERE.The Beauty and the Beast-esque fantasy drama tells the story of Feyre, who finds herself entwined with faeries after unknowingly killing one. When the 19-year-old huntress kills a wolf in the woods, a beast-like creature arrives to demand retribution for it. Dragged to a treacherous magical land she only knows about from legends, Feyre discovers that her captor is not an animal, but Tamlin, one of the lethal, immortal faeries who once ruled their world. Feyre must find a way to stop it or doom Tamlin and his world forever.I'm not a fantasy fan. I love fantasy in film and tv but not in books. I picked up this book cause I wanted to use it for my thesis for uni (don't even ask) and now after I graduated I decided to give it a go. My favorite genres to read are historical fiction and contemporary, and fantasy falls on a very different category. But the fantasy in this book man... it gripped me tight and didn't let me go.First I started off this book a bit confused. The language confused me a bit, the terms, all the information. I'm reading books in English while my native language is Greek so fantasy fell a bit harsh on me. As I said, I'm not a fantasy fan, and with fantasy comes many weird words and shit like that. But I kept going and after a while I got used to everything and started to enjoy the plot and the characters. I enjoyed very much the factor that there weren't many characters in this book. I don't like when a book is crowded with characters, it doesn't give me the space to love them all. This book succeeded in making all the characters lovable for me... even Rhysand. I fucking love Rhysand man. Unexpected feelings happening.The worldSarah J. Maascreated is so rich and dark and gloomy but also happy and hopeful and full of light, I truly enjoyed reading about it. I always get bored, to be honest, with descriptions and politics of different worlds but this one excited me. Even the fucking politics were exciting. I want to delve more into this world wHEN MY FUCKING BOOK ARRIVES.Now to the juicy shit... the romance. Holy fucking shit. I ship these two so hard I can't even breathe. When he sent her away I wanted to scream! He gave her a good fucking and left her hanging. Why am I laughing at this? But honestly, the romance was amazing. At first, I felt like the entire book was only gonna be about the romance and I didn't quite enjoy that but after all the revelations and the twists in the plot, the romance was used wisely. And I didn't expect that, because I have heard lots of things about this book. And now we have Rhysand... this dark, handsome motherfucker who has a gloomy past. This will become a triangle, I can feel it in my bones. But I'm here for it, for some reason. I love the heat Maas's romances convey in me.To sum it all up, this book took me a while to get into but it was all worth it. Maybe after this book I will start reading more fantasy. Maybe. Maybe not. As I'm waiting for the sequel to arrive, I will drawn my sorrow into crying about how amazing this first book was. Or maybe reread some parts. Maybe. Anyway, till the next one K BYE!!!""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '2.5 StarsOnce again, I find myself the odd man out when it comes to a massively popular book...I went into this really excited and andreallywanting to love this thing.After seeing this book and its successors paint my feed with its courts and thorns and wings and ruin, I knew there was a lot of hype surrounding this series in general.And this first installment just didn\'t live up to it for me, sadly.There, there, Court Thornians...Quite frankly, the first 60% of this book dragged like a U-Haul trailer with no wheels.Nothing really happened and the things that did didn\'t even make sense until after the book was over.And I\'m just not a fan of that. I like to enjoy bookswhileI\'m reading them, not only for the last 25-35% when everything that was murky throughout the whole book becomes clear.I also found myself WAY more interested in Rhysand than the actual love interest, Tamlin. Whoops!THAT SAID.Ididenjoy the writing and the ending.And while those things aren\'t enough to prompt me to rate this thing any higher,I AM going to read the second book.I trust my peeps and all of you are saying that, while the first book drags, the second book is ""OMG amazeballs.""

Despite not being a fan of the superfluous writing style or the lackluster world-building, I was still willing to rate it 3 stars by viewing it as an easy guilty pleasure romance book. The relationship seems harmless and I still don't see how it's as problematic as people dramatize it to be. The first half of the book is a standard Beauty and the Beast retelling ‚Äî not awful, but not special either ‚Äî and then the second half really dips in quality, which lowered my rating to 2 stars.A couple glaring issues that stood out to me:1) The background story of the curse is literally told instead of shown via a side character's lengthy monologue. This was disappointing since I was intrigued to find this out by piecing clues together, not by being told it straightforwardly like a regurgitated wikipedia article.2) The main character seems relatively smart but consistently has leaps of logic that are clearly there for the sake of plot. 9 out of 10 times she won't follow the advice of another character.3) The antagonist is SO cartoonish ‚Äî like mustache-twirling cartoonish. She gives a bunch of arbitrary challenges and rules for no reason other than for the sake of stringing along a story. It feels like she's hosting a game show or some overly complex scavenger hunt. There's no reason why she'd bother setting up any of these superfluous rules. I think this is the worst antagonist I've ever read.I'm willing to overlook the writing style and bland romance, but once I got to the part where Feyre answers the riddle, I had to drop it down to 2 stars because it was so ridiculous and lazy. I've heard that the sequel is much better though, so I am willing to give it another try, just not any time soon haha.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'First read: May 2015Second read: May 2016Third read: April 2017Fourth read: February 2018Fifth read: June 2019 ‚Äî I think this is my most read series alongside Harry Potter and Mistborn.Sixth reread: Feb 2021Seventh reread: September 2023Every reread of this book has somewhat differed but nothing too drastic. It‚Äôs still my least favourite in the series. There‚Äôs nostalgia involved since this was my first book by Sarah J Maas. I‚Äôve become really familiar with these books now. Or maybe I should say attached.It‚Äôs a great Beauty and the Beast retelling. It‚Äôs a great setup for the books to come, especially where Feyre is concerned and her character development, which is where Maas excels at.I quite frankly hated how loyal Feyre was to her family, though it‚Äôs understandable. But it‚Äôs this level of loyalty without any concern for her own well-being that leads to her downfall. Her loyalty to Tamlin when it came to the events that happen towards the end of the book destroy her. It was uncomfortable to read and see Feyre come to this realisation herself.This seems to straddle the line of YA and NA fantasy, which is why I‚Äôm assuming the world-building feels so lacklustre, and at times, juvenile. Amarantha read like a spoiled child, though she‚Äôs the villain.

Die Pr√§misse war sogar ganz gut und die Story unterhaltsam. Au√üerdem war das Pacing okay. Und ich mochte Viktor.Seht ihr? Ich KANN nette Sachen sagen. Wenn es welche zu sagen gibt.Leider gibt es auch zwei Sachen, die ganz und gar nicht nett waren:1.) Der Schreibstil. Sowas pr√§tenti√∂ses, gewollt literarisches, gek√ºnstelt ""frisches"" hab ich schon lange nicht mehr erlebt. Man merkt richtig wie die Autorin sich bei jedem Satz auf die Schulter klopft und wie ihr Verlag sie begeistert in ihren Marotten noch best√§rkt, denn der Stil ist 100% etwas was 50j√§hrige Marketingmanager f√ºr ""frech und frisch und jung"" halten und was alle anderen einfach nur nervig finden.Von allen Dinge, die ich rauspicken k√∂nnte, haben mich am meisten ihre Dialoge genervt. Nicht nur der meist banale Inhalt, sondern die Art, wie sie geschrieben waren.Hier ein Beispiel, was exemplarisch ist f√ºr das ganze Buch:Ich glaube, das ist keine gute Idee.Ich: Ich glaube, das ist keine gute Idee.""Ida: ""Wieso nicht?""Ich finde das recht offensichtlich.Ich: ""Ich finde das recht offensichtlich.""Ida: ""Was meinst du?""Muss ich das wirklich noch laut aussprechen?Ich: ""Muss ich das wirklich noch laut aussprechen?""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGHHHH!AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!Please shoot me now.DAS GANZE BUCH LANG!

Aber doch nicht in JEDER SZENE! Himmelherrgott nochmal.2.) Tilda. Boah ey.Tilda h√§tte ein ganz sympathischer Charakter sein k√∂nnen wenn es nicht vom ersten Kapitel an vollkommen offensichtlich gewesen w√§re was f√ºr ein Autorenliebling sie ist. Die Autorin findet Tilda einfach SO toll. SO TOLL. Sie kann alles. Nat√ºrlich ist sie die Beste in ihrem Studienfach. Nat√ºrlich ist sie nicht so wie die anderen M√§dchen, die irgendso einen Schei√ü wie Literatur studieren, nicht Tilda. Sie studiert Mathe! *gasp* Und sie ist so gut, dass sie als einzige ihre Aufgaben mit Papier und Bleistift l√∂sen und abgeben darf und nicht per PC. Sie kann n√§mlich nur so arbeiten, nicht mit schn√∂der Technik, weil sie eben eine ganz spezielle Schneeflocke ist. Sie ist auch so gut, dass man ihr eine Promotionsstelle praktisch hinterherschmei√üt. Und jeder wei√ü die gibt\'s wie Sand am Meer, vor allem in Mathe.Tilda muss sich nie f√ºr irgendwas anstrengen, alles f√§llt ihr in den Scho√ü.Nat√ºrlich ist jeder Junge, der im Buch namentlich erw√§hnt ist irgendwie in sie verliebt. Der Bruder ihrer besten Freundin. Check. Der Freund ihrer besten Freundin. Check. Und der unfassbar sch√∂ne, dramatische Viktor, auf den alle stehen. Check. Aber Tilda ist nat√ºrlich viel zu lonely und special und merkt gar nicht wie toll sie ist.Sie schwimmt jeden Tag 22 Bahnen. Weil sie so quirky und special ist. Genau 22. Nicht 20. Nicht 23. Es m√ºssen 22 sein, weil ihr Zahlen so wichtig sind. üôÑ *hardcore eyeroll*Als jemand, der mal im Schwimmverein war, will ich dazu sagen: 22 Bahnen? Ernsthaft? Erstens ist das eine fucking unpr√§zise Angabe f√ºr jemanden, der annoyingly pr√§zise Angaben zu allem braucht, damit wir ja nicht vergessen, dass sie Mathe studiert. Ist es eine 50m-Bahn oder eine 25m-Bahn, Tilda??? Das macht n√§mlich einen gewaltigen Unterschied, Tilda!!! Bei ner 50m-Bahn reden wir von 1100m, bei einer 25m-bahn nur noch von 550m. Zweitens - beides ist nicht besonders viel. Daf√ºr dass Tilda sich so fucking viel darauf einbildet - sorry, aber das ist doch l√§cherlich. Im Verein sind wir locker 6000m pro Sitzung geschwommen (damit auch Tilda das versteht: Das sind 120 Bahnen bei ner 50m-Bahn - oder 240 Bahnen bei einer 25m-Bahn.) Also wtf soll dieser st√§ndige Schei√ü mit den 22 Bahnen? Darauf muss man sich nicht so viel einbilden.Ihre angeblich ""beste Freundin"" ist nur daf√ºr da, dass Tilda NOCH besser wegkommt. Marlene ist n√§mlich eine oberfl√§chliche Partyfluse vor dem Herren, deren Elternhaus liebevoll und perfekt ist (im Gegensatz zu Tildas, die das √§rmste Hascherl ever is) und die das gar nicht zu w√ºrdigen wei√ü. Sie hat vor allem Partys im Kopf und fliegt dauernd in den Urlaub (was Tilda sich aber nicht leisten kann, weil sie so arm ist!) und sie lebt in Berlin (was Tilda nicht machen kann, weil sie sich um ihre Schwester k√ºmmern muss, denn sie ist ganz arm dran), sie feiert ganze N√§chte durch (was Tilda nicht machen kann, weil sie muss arbeiten, denn sie GANZ ARM dran), und sie streitet sich dauernd mit ihren Eltern, die liebevoll und gro√üartig sind (und Tilda ist schon dankbar, wenn sie mal nur am Tisch sitzen und ein Wurstbr√∂tchen essen darf, denn das kennt sie von zu Hause nicht, denn - alle im Chor! - sie ist GANZ ARM DRAN!).Ich kotze im Strahl.Also die ganze Beweihr√§ucherung von Tilda ging mir so auf den Kranz.

Doch die Leichtigkeit wurde bald von Beklemmung abgel√∂st, dem Blick hinter die Fassade.

Tilda ist selbstlos, verantwortungsbewusst, liebevoll im Umgang mit Ida, tut alles, im ihr ein sicheres Leben zu erm√∂glichen. Und wenn es das Geld zul√§sst, Miracoli statt Gut & G√ºnstig zu kaufen..Doch w√§hrend Ida ihre Schwester und ihre Bilder hat, hat Tilda niemanden. Fr√ºher, da gab es Marlene. Sie waren beste Freundinnen, doch die Zeit und ihre unterschiedlichen Lebensrealit√§ten hatten sie entzweit. Da ist nur die Vergangenheit, die sie verbindet: wie sie nebeneinander auf dem Feld lagen in diesem letzten Sommer, √ºber die Zukunft nachdachten, wie sie sich an der Hand hielten w√§hrend der Beerdigung von Ivan, ihrem Freund, gemeinsam lachten und weinten. Marlene war eine Zuflucht f√ºr sie, damals, als es Ida noch nicht gab; jeden Tag sa√ü sie bei ihrer Familie am Abendbrottisch, um nur nicht Zuhause zu sein. Eine Nacht vergessen, die Angst, die Aggressionen, nur sie selbst sein - sie kann, darf nicht mehr vor ihrem eigentlichen Zuhause fl√ºchten. Mit Ida hatte sie wieder einen Anker, wieder eine Familie, um die sie sich k√ºmmern musste, damit sie nicht weiter zerbrach..Bis dahin war es eine Heldinnengeschichte, der Weg zur Selbsterm√§chtigung zweier Schwestern - und mein Herz war voll. Doch als Viktor kam, war es, als h√§tte jemand den St√∂psel im Schwimmbecken gezogen. Ich hab\'s nicht mehr gef√ºhlt. Die Dynamiken ver√§nderten sich, alles wirkte √ºberhastet und aufgesetzt, zu konstruiert; ich war ern√ºchtert, denn Viktor h√§tte es nicht gebraucht. Entsprechend genervt war ich von der zweiten H√§lfte, dem Hin und Her zwischen Tilda und Viktor, dem vermeintlichen Freiheitsschlag.

Haben wir alle das gleiche Buch gelesen?! ü§êNachdem ‚Äû22 Bahnen‚Äú √ºberall einen gigantischen Hype erfahren hat und sogar zum Lieblingsbuch des unabh√§ngigen Buchhandels gew√§hlt wurde, war ich doch sehr neugierig darauf- auch, wenn ich mich urspr√ºnglich wenig angesprochen hat. Die ganzen √ºberragenden Rezensionen haben mich neugierig gemacht. Die ganze Zeit habe ich darauf gewartet, dass der Wendepunkt kommt, an dem sich Tilda weiterentwickelt, an dem die Geschichte sich wendet, an dem es GUT wird. Und er kam nicht. üòÖ Tilda bleibt die gleiche, verkauft sich als so erwachsen und selbst reflektiert, aber schafft es nicht, ihren Stolz zu √ºberwinden und nach Hilfe zu fragen - oder es alleine zu schaffen. Nein, stattdessen muss der ‚ÄûSeemann‚Äú als Ritter in goldener R√ºstung auftauchen und sie retten. Langweilig, wenig fortschrittlich, vorhersehbar - nur um mal ein paar Stichpunkte zu nennen, die mir dazu einfallen. üò¥Dann: C. W. kann mir doch nicht erz√§hlen, dass st√§ndig √Ñrzte ihrer Mutter Antidepressiva verschreiben und den K√∂rper entgiften, ohne, dass mal ein Psychiater, das Jugendamt oder andere h√∂here Institutionen aufmerksam werden. Stattdessen deckt Tilda ihre Mutter kontinuierlich?! Sp√§testens als sie Ida wiederholt schl√§gt, sollte die ach so f√ºrsorgliche Schwester eingreifen? Tilda ist erwachsen, mindestens 23 Jahre alt. Kein Kind. Da kann man das schon mal erwarten. Stattdessen spielt sie mit dem Gedanken, nach Berlin zu gehen und ihre ‚ÄûGeliebte‚Äú Schwester bei der Alkoholikerin in h√§uslicher Gewalt und Vernachl√§ssigung zur√ºckzulassen. Ich bin sprachlos.Die Anziehung zwischen dem MMC und FMC ist √ºbrigens auch v√∂llig an den Haaren herbeigezogen. Mehr als sich gegenseitig anschweigen und beim schwimmen zu stalken, ist auch nicht passiert, aber das nur am Rande.Kommen wir zu dem Punkt, der mich am meisten st√∂rt: Die Darstellung von Armut in diesem Roman. Man merkt - auch wenn man sich die Biografie C. W.s ansieht -, dass die Autorin noch nie mit armen Menschen in ihrem Leben interagiert hat, aus reichem Elternhaus stammt.Ich finde es schon besch√§mend, dass Armut derma√üen ‚Äûromantisiert‚Äú wird. Dar√ºber hinaus beklagt sich die Protagonistin st√§ndig, nur ‚ÄûGut&G√ºnstig‚Äú-Produkte kaufen zu k√∂nnen. 1. Sind diese Produkte, zu Edeka geh√∂rend, weder ein Indikator f√ºr Armut. 2. Richtige Armut ist, wenn man sich nicht mal Essen leisten kann. 3. Werden laufend teure (!) Markenprodukte genannt, die die Protagonistin verwendet (Brunnen-Collegeblock, Listerin, Schwarzkopf ..), sowas kaufen sich ‚ÄûArme‚Äú Menschen nicht, da werden die Priorit√§ten v√∂llig falsch gesetzt.

Da ich bei zu sehr gehypten B√ºchern immer vorsichtig bin, habe ich mir bei dem Buch besonders lange Zeit gelassen und ihm erst jetzt eine Chance gegeben und ich muss leider sagen, dass ich den Hype nicht nachvollziehen kann.Schuld daran ist besonders der Schreibstil, den ich als sehr anstrengend empfunden habe. Besonders die Dialoge sind unglaublich anstrengend und vom Stil her nicht mein Fall, denn diese werden eher wie in einem Drehbuch geradezu aufgelistet, was den Lesefluss f√ºr mich enorm gest√∂rt hat. Die vielen Wiederholungen haben ebenfalls dazu beigetragen, dass mir der Schreibstil nicht zugesagt hat. Ich konnte irgendwann gar nicht mehr mitz√§hlen, wie oft dar√ºber geredet wurde, dass man getrunken, gemalt, geschwommen, Joints geraucht, kassiert oder Abendbrot gegessen hat.Dabei ist das Buch mit seinen gerade einmal knapp 210 Seiten gar nicht mal so dick. Dennoch hatte ich oft das Gef√ºhl, dass man das Buch mit unn√∂tigen Wiederholungen und jeder Menge Product Placement in die L√§nge gestreckt hat. Wieso man immer wieder bestimmte Marken beim Einkaufen erw√§hnen musste oder warum in aller Ausf√ºhrlichkeit beschrieben wurde, mit welchen Produkten man sich genau geduscht und eingecremt hat, wei√ü wohl nur die Autorin.Auch die Figuren konnten mich leider nicht √ºberzeugen. Tilda, aus deren Sicht die Geschichte erz√§hlt wird, kam mir anf√§nglich sympathisch vor, allerdings wurde sie mit der Zeit immer nerviger und sie hat deutlich an Sympathie eingeb√º√üt. Ihr Umgang mit ihrer j√ºngeren Schwester fand ich zwar sehr ber√ºhrend, aber ansonsten ist Tilda f√ºr mich leider keine Protagonistin, die man in ihrem Leben haben m√∂chte. Anstatt ihrer schwer alkoholkranke Mutter zu helfen, macht sie ihr nur Vorw√ºrfe und beleidigt sie. Ihre Freundschaften existieren quasi nur, weil man gemeinsam trinkt und raucht und obwohl sie immer wieder sagt, wie egal ihr die Menschen sind, regt sie sich wahnsinnig √ºber mehrere Seiten dar√ºber auf, wenn jemand nicht ‚ÄûTsch√ºss‚Äú sagt. Dazu tritt das Buch immer wieder auf der Stelle, weil bei Tilda einfach nichts passiert. Sie geht zur Uni, sitzt an der Kasse, sie schwimmt, sie verbringt Zeit mit ihrer Schwester. Dass man hier einen solchen Alltag aufzeigt, ist zwar an sich vollkommen in Ordnung, da nicht jeder ein spektakul√§res Leben f√ºhren muss, allerdings h√§tte es auch gereicht, wenn man dies nicht seitenweise immer wiederholt h√§tte.Dass man gegen Ende auch noch unbedingt eine kleine Liebesgeschichte einbauen musste, hat f√ºr mich ebenfalls nicht funktioniert, zumal diese alles andere als authentisch ist. Man trifft sich, man redet nur sehr gezwungen miteinander, man verliebt sich angeblich, schweigt sich sehr viel an, aber letztendlich hat sie noch nicht einmal seine Telefonnummer, erwartet aber, dass er sich immer bei ihr melden wird.Letztendlich h√§tte ‚Äû22 Bahnen‚Äú ein gutes Buch sein k√∂nnen, wenn die Dialoge besser eingebaut worden w√§ren und auch die Charaktere sympathischer und mehr Tiefe besessen h√§tten.

Nun hat Tilda die Aussicht auf eine Promotionsstelle. In Berlin. Was soll da aus Ida werden, die gerade erst auf das Gymnasium gekommen ist und eher vertr√§umt und zur√ºckhaltend scheint? Und dann ist da noch Viktor, der eigentlich so gar nicht in Tildas streng getaktetes Leben passt, das schon ein nichtfunktionierender Kopierer in der Uni aus dem Lot bringen kann.Tilda ist die beeindruckende Hauptfigur und Erz√§hlerin in Carolina Wahls Deb√ºtroman ‚Äû22 Bahnen‚Äú. Noch so jung, aber schon so erwachsen, so zielstrebig, so klug, so verantwortungsbewusst, so warmherzig und so empathisch im Umgang mit ihrer kleinen Schwester. Was sie sich ausdenkt, um diese f√ºr das Leben mit ihrer Mutter zu r√ºsten, wenn Tilda in Berlin sein sollte, ist einfach umwerfend. Und trotzdem ist Tilda eben auch jung, auf der Suche, will leben und feiern. Sie wirkt nicht wie eine Kunstfigur, sondern wie eine Person aus Fleisch und viel Herzblut, die man gern zur Freundin oder eben zur gro√üen Schwester h√§tte. Aber auch Ida ist ein toller Charakter, den die Autorin da geschaffen hat: eigenwillig, kreativ, originell, sehr sensibel, aber viel st√§rker als sie und Tilda selbst es f√ºr m√∂glich gehalten haben. Beide richten sich - trotz der schweren Umst√§nde ‚Äì die aggressive, ichbezogene, von Depressionen geplagte Mutter, die unter Alkoholsucht leidet und am Leben verzweifelt und ihre T√∂chter im besten Falle gar nicht wahrzunehmen scheint ‚Äì in ihrem Leben ein, sie f√ºhren ein gutes Leben als Schwesternfamilie und reifen zu tollen Menschen heran. Es gibt kein Leiden und Klagen, kein Selbstmitleid, sondern der Roman vermittelt einen solchen bodenst√§ndigen Optimismus und eine Gewissheit um das gelingende Leben, wie ihn Ida selbst in Worte fassen kann, wenn sie zu ihrer Mutter sagt: ‚ÄûWir wissen, dass du es ohne Hilfe nicht schaffst, und wir wissen, dass wir es ohne dich und auch mit dir schaffen.‚ÄúDer Stil wechselt von schlicht, rau und sehr neuhochdeutsch, hin zu magisch-poetisch, wenn Tilda Stimmungen in der Natur spiegelt und die wundersch√∂nen Zeichnungen ihrer kleinen Schwester beschreibt, die die Wirklichkeit in M√§rchen spiegelt - ein Spiel, das die beiden bis zur Perfektion beherrschen.Caroline Wahl schreibt anders, pr√§zise und zugleich pr√§gnant. Besonders wenn es um Dialoge geht, beh√§lt sie einen schlichten Stil, verzichtet auf Ein- und Ausleitungsverben der direkten Rede sowie auf Anf√ºhrungszeichen. Was zuerst ungewohnt erscheint, ergibt im Laufe des Buches Sinn, schlie√ülich kann der Leser schlussfolgern in welcher Art und Weise gesprochen wird.Zudem arbeitet die Autorin mit vielen Motiven, die, bei genauem Lesen, vereinzelt auftauchen und eine Gleichm√§√üigkeit suggerieren, die von Tildas Alltag bestimmt wird.Eine gro√üe Leseempfehlung f√ºr aufw√ºhlende, melancholische und trotz allem wundersch√∂ne Lesestunden mit einem der vielversprechendsten aktuellen Coming-of-Age-Romane.Ich fiebere geradezu hin zu dem am 15.

Es wurde mal wieder das Stereotyp bedient, sich durch Leistung aus Armut herausarbeiten zu k√∂nnen: Tilda ist in der Uni trotz Mehrfachbelastung (sie finanziert die Familie und k√ºmmert sich um ihre kleine Schwester) wahnsinnig flei√üig und erfolgreich, ihr winkt eine Promotion in Berlin und damit der ‚Äûsoziale Aufstieg‚Äú, Ida schmei√üt mit elf fr√∂hlich den gesamten Haushalt und verarbeitet potenziell Traumatisches als k√ºnstlerisches Genie.

And it is an astonishingly conservative love story that develops slowly.Unfortunately, it rarely develops any real depth. The banality of everyday life is often reflected in what is portrayed, without a double bottom. What is said is meant.

A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #2)
",Sarah J. Maas,4.65,2471012,13262,"Fantasy, Romance, Young Adult, New Adult, Fiction, Romantasy, Fae",626,03-05-2016,"The seductive and stunning #1 New York Times bestselling sequel to Sarah J. Maas's spellbinding A Court of Thorns and Roses .Feyre has undergone more trials than one human woman can carry in her heart. Though she's now been granted the powers and lifespan of the High Fae, she is haunted by her time Under the Mountain and the terrible deeds she performed to save the lives of Tamlin and his people.As her marriage to Tamlin approaches, Feyre's hollowness and nightmares consume her. She finds herself split into two different one who upholds her bargain with Rhysand, High Lord of the feared Night Court, and one who lives out her life in the Spring Court with Tamlin. While Feyre navigates a dark web of politics, passion, and dazzling power, a greater evil looms. She might just be the key to stopping it, but only if she can harness her harrowing gifts, heal her fractured soul, and decide how she wishes to shape her future-and the future of a world in turmoil.Bestselling author Sarah J. Maas's masterful storytelling brings this second book in her dazzling, sexy, action-packed series to new heights.","[{'rating': 5, 'content': 'Rating: All the stars in the universe""I needed not to be dead when I agreed.‚Äù‚ÄúYou needed not to be alone.‚ÄùI don\'t really know what to say in order to adequately express how stunningA Court of Mist and Furyis. How exquisitely beautiful. How slow-burningly sorrowful. How... joyous at the same time. I\'m at a lack of words for describing how it truly made mefeel-- because this book resonates with my soul and my heart and my mind so wonderfully, it just filled me with awe from within, leaving me drowning in an eternal swirl of emotions, a ruin because of a mere novel.‚ÄúBut then she snapped your neck.‚ÄùTears rolled down his face.‚ÄúAnd I felt you die,‚Äù he whispered.Tears were sliding down my own cheeks.This book is a story aboutlifeandloveand every gray shade in between. A story about the bleak days and the lovely winds of change. A story about hard-fought happiness and soul-wrenching sacrifices. And a story about a girl who finds herself drifting away into the fields of nothingness only to discover the stars and moon and night sky pointing towards her glorious rebirth.Feyre, oh dear Feyre. I amso so proudof her and who she\'s become at the end of the novel. She\'s so exhilarating and vibrant and incredibly strong. But she was not like this in the beginning. The events in the previous book shredded her apart from the inside out, living only a shell of the brave young woman we cheered for. My heart ached for her. But she finds herself again -- her true self, her wild heart, her luminous spark of daring, fierce, brilliant dreams. And the heroine that emerges is coated with sheer determination, powerful bravery and astounding compassion.I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal.I was a survivor, and I was strong.I would not be weak, or helpless again.I would not, could not be broken. Tamed.I want to assure everyone that not one character,NO ONE, acts OOC. And besides Feyre, no one changes. You know what I\'m talking about -- the alpha-males vulturing around Feyre. ACoTaR only showed us bits and pieces, but we mustn\'t jump to the wrong conclusions about certain people especially since the depth of ACoTaR felt (at least to me) similar to a Vegas wedding after meeting a guy in the hotel lobby, whereasACoMaF was a reality check. Harsh and cruel and unyielding.This being said, I liked Tamlin. He was true to himself. Everything he does, he does out of love and of fear of losing Feyre. And we all know that people blinded by love can often make mistakes -- and Tam did. Many mistakes. A lack of understanding intoxicated him and an imperative need for control severed his perception. Paradoxically, we get to know him better even if he\'s not a present figure throughout the book. And perhaps, now that we\'ve seen more of his layers and facades... perhaps we see him in a much different light. He has issues and I truly believe Amarantha messed him up mentally -- nowhere near the trauma Feyre endured, but still a haunting scar imprinted on his demeanor. Regardless, do not mistake all I\'ve said as excuses in his defense, because they are not. They do not excuse his ultimate authority, his condescending attitude and his infuriatingly rash decisions for which he does need to suffer the consequences.I just cannot wait to see him get his ass handed to him by Feyre.‚ÄúHe did‚Äîdoes love me, Rhysand.‚Äù‚ÄúThe issue isn‚Äôt whether he loved you, it‚Äôs how much. Too much. Love can be a poison.‚ÄùRhysand, on the other hand, was the epitome ofdamn. I might even have a confession to make... He might...*gulp*... have overthrown Will Herondale and Dorian Havilliard as my favorite book boyfriend!!Rhys embodies the highest standards for fictional males. His bad-boy allure. His arrogance. His cunning mind. His elegance. His astounding power. But these are nothing compared to his internal beauty -- his selflessness, his nerve-wrecking intensity, his carefully crafted mask, his turmoil and his kindness. His self-doubt brought me to my knees, because he is such a precious cinnamon roll and he doesn\'t realize it. Andholy shithis past was just too much --I WAS (AM) AN EMOTIONAL MESS.‚ÄúYou think I don‚Äôt know how stories get written‚Äîhow this story will be written?‚Äù Rhys put his hands on his chest, his face more open, more anguished than I‚Äôd seen it. ‚ÄúI am the dark lord, who stole away the bride of spring. I am a demon, and a nightmare, and I will meet a bad end. He is the golden prince‚Äîthe hero who will get to keep you as his reward for not dying of stupidity and arrogance.‚ÄùAnd you wanna know what?HE\'S A GODDAMN FEMINIST. If that doesn\'t make you fall in love with him head over heels, I don\'t know what will. Plus Rhys is basically the hottest fictional guy ever created (Darkling + Warner + Dorian = omg). WHY ISN\'T HE REAL???*sobs*‚ÄúTamlin won‚Äôt allow it.‚Äù‚ÄúTamlin isn‚Äôt your keeper, and you know it.‚Äù‚ÄúI‚Äôm his subject, and he is my High Lord‚Äî‚Äù‚ÄúYou are no one‚Äôs subject.‚Äù***‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôd be a mercy to be ended‚ÄîA broad hand gripped my face‚Äîgently enough not to hurt, but hard enough to make me look at him. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you ever think that,‚Äù Rhysand hissed, his eyes livid. ‚ÄúNot for one damned moment.‚Äù***""She wins,‚Äù Rhys breathed. ‚ÄúThat bitch wins if you let yourself fall apart.""Lucien remains clever and intuitive and even though his relationship with our heroine gets stranded, his only flaw is undying, blind loyalty and I cannot fault him for that.Moving now onto more serious topics -- the new characters. We have quite a lot, but by far the loveliest ones are Rhysand\'s Inner Circle.They\'re squad goals. FierceMorrigan; strange and kickassAmren; sassy, arrogant and skilledCassian; reserved and observantAzriel. All these, plus Rhys, entangle a dynamic that createsa family. I loved them to bits. Secondary characters, yet so wonderfully nuanced, three-dimensional characters that gut you with their own stories and make you shed a tear at how much they love each other. Plus, they cracked me up on a constant basis. And the respect and unflinching support they have between them was all kinds ofwowandawwww.Okay. Enough with the stalling. Let\'s venture into dangerous territory akathe romance.*deep breath*I want to start by sayingthere is no love triangle-- there\'s onlya wonderful, all-consuming and healthyrelationship that evolves naturally until it reaches paramount heights. I was constantly plastered with a stupid, goofy grin on my face whenever this couple interacted or was simply in the same scene. What makes them absolutely beautiful in my perspective isthe mutual respect, honesty and supportthey have for each other -- it paints them with anempoweringand downright heartwarming glow. Their amazingfriendship, their sparkingchemistry, their hilariousbanterand their hot as helltensionhad me repeatedly blessing the gods for Maas.‚ÄúHe locked you up because he knew‚Äîthe bastard knew what a treasure you are. That you are worth more than land or gold or jewels. He knew, and wanted to keep you all to himself.‚Äù***‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking,‚Äù he said, following the flick of my tongue over my bottom lip, ‚Äúthat I look at you and feel like I‚Äôm dying. Like I can‚Äôt breathe.‚ÄùBesides those strong traits of their relationship, I need to mention the steaminess and sexiness and overallHOTNESS.Because this book? It\'s hot. Like black-in-the-middle-of-July-in-California-hot. NA, after all. You thought ACoTaR was hot?YOU THOUGHT WRONG-- prepare yourself for hyperventilating, fangirling and swooning, \'cause SJM\'s writing skills slay in those scenes.‚ÄúI heard every word between you. I knew you could take care of yourself, and yet ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù He went back to his pie, swallowing a bite before continuing. ‚ÄúAnd yet I found myself deciding that if you took his hand, I would find a way to live with it. It would be your choice.‚ÄùI sipped from my wine. ‚ÄúAnd if he had grabbed me?‚ÄùThere was nothing but uncompromising will in his eyes. ‚ÄúThen I would have torn apart the world to get you back.‚ÄùOh oh oh but there are some other ships that get my blood pumping even though they\'re not sailing -- YET THEY SHOULD. They totally should. Mozriel and Nessian embody pure awesomeness.And Elain and Lucien will be so interesting to see play out!What I enjoyed tremendously about this particular sequel is how it managed to expand the realm beyond its initial borders, in terms of world-building, depth and history. ACoTaR now seems like a small piece of a giant puzzle, the lovely but common retelling ofBeauty and the Beastpaling in comparison to ACoMaF which, while just teasing us with glimpses of the real deal that\'s to come, contained a sense of radiant and vastepicness.The most special and bewildering aspect is the lush and vivid portrayal of the Night Court. Enthralling and contradictory, it completely enraptures you with its seductive tone. So different from the Spring Court (and Summer Court which we get to visit!!). But I expected something disheartening and equally dark, and while this mysterious court has that vibe and then some, there is also such glorious light and normalcy and elegance that reside in its spectrum. The Court of Nightmares gave me goosebumps. The Court of Dreams, however, gave me breath and life. The book centers in Velaris andohmygod this city! I loved Velaris with all my being and if there ever was a fictional place or universe in which I\'d want to live, then Velaris and the Night Court are it.Plotwise, there isn\'t really much to say, honestly, besides the fact that the king of Hybern is the new big bad wolf (as expected) and he wants to bring chaos into this world. But his presence is subtle, his threat only looming on the horizon -- the finale will deal with him more. Yet we encounter intrigue and secrets and eye-opening side stories and tales that create the legacy of Prythan hand in hand with the world-building. It felt similar toHeir of Fire, a journey of healing rather than grueling war. However, as in HoF, the last few chapters left me breathless and white-knuckled as I gripped the book to read every single word.Betrayals, alliances, resurrections, magic and evil marvelously unraveled in an explosive punch, a mic drop of a sort.It leaves you craving more the very next instant.We\'ll see more Nesta and Elain and Tam and Lucien in the next book, that\'s for sure. But the stakes are so high and the game of hide and seek between friends and enemies so dangerous that I cannot help but be in a continual frenzy until the sequel. It\'s going to be as much of a masterpiece as this one, certainly.A Court of Mist and Furymade me want to re-read it the second I\'ve finished it -- and re-read again afterwards. It made me want to live in its universe. It made me want to be friends with the characters, tell them how much I adore them and just how precious they all are. It made me feel alive in so many ways that it also rendered me speechless.But you know where its absolute beauty resides? It\'s in the cleverness with which it was constructed. Sarah J. Maas outdid herself -- with the loose threads, with the vibe ofHades & Persephoneand with the countless clues and hints that begged for a re-read of ACoTaR in order to pick them up bit by bit. No one can say she changed her creation to her whim, because it was all carefully planned out, mapped out ever since the first page of the first installment.‚ÄúYou are my salvation, Feyre.‚ÄùA Court of Mist and Furyis my newfavorite bookand I\'ll keep it close to my heart from now on. Enchanting, clever and masterfully written, it shattered my expectations and raised itself on a gold pedestal. I love it completely and I hope you\'ll do so too -- as fiercely as Feyre loves the night.On a chirpier note though, I\'ll go drown myself into a hell of a long book-slump because nothing,absolutely nothing can come close to this glorious book while its remnants shine so brightly in my mind.ENJOY! <3P.S.:My headcanon fanart for ACoMaF:My Night Court photoset is a bit spoilery, so here\'s theTumblr link.My ACoMaF inspired playlist --The Stars Who ListenListen here:8tracks;YouTube.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'HOLY FUCKING SHIT. HOLY. FUCKING. SHIT.A COURT OF MIST AND FURY IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE.***CONTAINS A SHIT TON OF SPOILERS***REALLY, IF YOU HAVE NOT FINISHED THE BOOK YET, DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW.THIS BOOK IS WAAAAAAAY MORE THAN 5 STARS, IT\'S MORE LIKE 1000000000000000/5 STARS. I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE PERFECT BUT I DIDN\'T KNOW IT WAS GONNA BETHISPERFECT.To be completely honest with you guys, I have absolutely no idea where to start, so I\'m warning you, this is gonna be far from an actual review.May 3rd was the day I died.I ran to my mailbox, knowing what awaited me there. I opened it and saw the box, amazon prime tape all over it. I took it and ran back inside my house. I stared at the box and took a deep breath...THEN RIPPED THAT SHIT UP. I CLAWED AT IT, SHREDDING THE WHOLE FUCKING BOX IN THE PROCESS. I SAW THAT BLUE FUCKING COVER AND KNEW THAT MY LIFE WAS NEVER GONNA BE THE SAME. I TOOK THAT FUCKING BOOK AND TURNED THAT SHIT OVER. THE COVER WAS FUCKING BEAUTIFUL. SCREAMING LIKE I WAS BEING TORTURED IN THE DEEP PITS OF HELL, I RAN AND SAT MY ASS DOWN ON THE COUCH. I OPENED THAT SHIT UP AND READ TIL MY EYES BLED. DAMN STRAIGHT.So all I read in the first 40 pages or so was blah blah blah Tamlin blah blah blah Where\'s Rhys.And then the moment we\'ve been waiting for happened. The moment whereRHYSAND INTERRUPTS FEYRE\'S WEDDING TO BRING HER TO THE NIGHT COURT. FUCK YEAH.The Night Court is the most beautiful thing ever. Could it be any better? No. It was perfection. And when Rhys winnows with her there, Feyre\'s first instinct is to throw a shoe at him.THE ALL-POWERFUL, MOST FEARED HIGH LORD OF THE NIGHT COURT GOT HIT BY A SHOE.It was adorable.And Rhys helped teach Feyre how to read and it was the best thing ever. All the while training her on her new found powers. These powers came from the seven High Lords and Feyre has all of them.EVEN RHYS\'SFeyre became a very strong character in this book, Sarah knows how to work in that character development! She knew how to fight for herself and always wanted to be there to help in times of need. And the reason for leaving the Spring Court forever was because stupid Tamlin didn\'t let her go anywhere and practically made the estate Feyre\'s new prison cell. How symbolic. Remember that time Under the Mountain, Tamlin? When your ""beloved"" was trapped in that same cell for three whole months? How you didn\'t do anything about it and watched her rot? How on her last day Under the Mountain, you wanted to have sex with her instead of trying to free her? Ever think of those things Tamlin? Doesn\'t seem like it because now you\'ve recreated that same cell that\'s caused her so much trauma. Isn\'t he the greatest.When Feyre made the decision to stay at the Night Court with Rhys and the squad (who I adore so much by the way), I was so happy. Not just because that meant Rhys and Feyre time (whoo!), but because it showed how strong she\'s become and that she finally escaped the captivity of the Spring Court into the freedom of the Night Court. And she is a total bad ass.The Night Court squad is so awesome. We\'ve got Mor, Amren, Cassian, and Azriel who I love all equally. They all have character depth, flaws, and pasts that we learn about. Mor\'s past was devastating and made me want to just give her the biggest hug. I also enjoyed amren a lot because she looks like she could kill you and will actually kill you. And Azriel and Cassian are also really fun to read about as well. They are all cinnamon rolls.Let me just say, I love it when the girl saves the guy. In this case, it was Feyre saving Rhysand. They were flying and Rhys was hit in the back with ash arrows and was captured and whipped. Now Feyre, she wasMAD.She winnowed and killed the guys torturing Rhys like the total boss she is and saved Rhys from death. I was seriously so scared for my baby.NOW IS THE TIME TO BRING IT UP GUYS. THE MOMENT WE\'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR. WE WANTED IT TO HAPPEN FOR SO LONG. AND NOW IT\'S OUT IN THE OPEN. READY THE CANON.RHYSAND AND FEYRE ARE MATES.RHYSAND. AND. FEYRE. ARE. MATES.THE FANDOM RIGHT NOW.AND RHYS HAD DREAMS ABOUT FEYRE BEFORE HE EVEN MET HER. WHEN HE FIRST MET FEYRE HE HAD A SENSE THAT THEY WERE MATES. HE KNEW THE WHOLE TIME, AND IT BROUGHT MORE TEARS TO MY POOR EYES. IT ACTUALLY MAKES ME WANT TO REREAD A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES JUST TO HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW ON IT. AND RHYSAND REALIZED HE LOVED FEYRE WHEN HE HELD THE DAGGER TO AMARANTHRA\'S NECK.RHYSAND AND FEYRE ARE MATES AND EVERYTHING IS RIGHT IN THE WORLD.AND WHEN RHYS TOLD FEYRE EVERYTHING, (AND I MEAN EVERYTHING)...(LIKE REALLY EVERYTHING), I CRIED. IT WAS SOOOO.... I\'M SORRY I CAN\'T EVEN PUT IT INTO WORDS, BUT YOU PROBABLY FELT THE SAME THING. YOU KNOW.AND THE NIGHT OF STARFALL. OMG MY BABIES. THEY WERE AT THE BALCONY AND THEY WERE SHARING PERSONAL THINGS (I LIVE FOR THESE MOMENTS). AND THE ABSOLUTE MOST ADORABLE THING THAT HAPPENED WAS WHEN THEY BOTH WERE HIT IN THE FACE BY THE STARLIGHT AND LAUGHED. LAUGHED. AND SMILED SO MUCH. FEYRE HADN\'T SMILED LIKE THAT IN FOREVER. AND OH DEAR LORD SAVE ME, I\'M PICTURING THE GRIN RHYSAND GAVE FEYRE RIGHT NOW AND IT MAKES ME MEEEELLLLTTTT. I JUST SIMPLY CANNOT.Now, let\'s talk about the hottest scenes ever between my dear Rhys and Feyre.THEY WERE SO STEAMY AND I WAS FREAKING OUT THE WHOLE TIME. I DIDN\'T KNOW IF THIS WAS REAL LIFE OR NOT. AND THEY LASTED PAAAAAGGGGEESSS. A GLORIOUS AMOUNT OF PAGES. THESE WERE THE FELLOW STEAMY SCENES:COURT OF NIGHTMARES.THE CRAMPED BEDROOM.MATE REALIZATION. (THE BEST ONE)And Rhys is not who we expected him to be. He\'s sacrificed so much for his people like I can\'t even explain becauseHE SACRIFICED SO DAMN MUCH.And I seriously cried when he revealed all these things about himself.MAIN CAUSE OF MY EMOTIONAL TRAUMA RIGHT THERE.I could go on and on forever about the many many many precious Rhys and Feyre moments, but let\'s talk about that ending.Things were so perfect so far that I was getting scared. Scared that all that perfectness was going to be ripped away and I was going to be one emotional mess. And for a minute there, I was. You guys know what I\'m talking about.So Feyre and Rhysand acted like Feyre was under Rhysand\'s control the whole time so it made it seem like Feyre actually still loved Tamlin and that she wanted to go back with him. And then she wanted to make it seem more real. And I\'m like ""FEYRE IF YOU FUCKING TELL THE KING TO BREAK YOUR MATE BOND I SWEAR-"" And then she tells the king to break the mate bond. And Rhysand\'s screams just shattered my heart when he was about to. And shithead Tamlin\'s says ""Do it."".AND THE FUCKING KING OF HYBERN BROKE RHYS AND FEYRE\'S MATE BOND.I THOUGHT IT WAS OVER THEN AND THERE. I COMPLETELY LOST MY SHIT.BUT WAIT. IT\'S NOT OVER.RHYSAND AND FEYRE WERE ALSO ACTING THAT OUT TOO. THE MATE BOND WASN\'T BROKEN. I REPEAT, THE MATE BOND WAS NOT BROKEN. THE KING JUST BROKE THE BARGAIN WITHOUT REALIZING IT WASN\'T THE MATE BOND. THAT LOVE CANNOT BE BROKEN, ESPECIALLY RHYSAND AND FEYRE\'S. AND SO NOW THIS SETS UP THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD BOOK. FEYRE IS GOING TO SPY ON THE SPRING COURT AND SEND THE INFORMATION DOWN THE MATE BOND TO RHYS. YEAH FEYRE YOU GO GIRL.Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that Nesta and Elain were turned into High Fae. And Lucien is mated with Elain. Crazy, am I right?!AND FEYRE IS NOW HIGH LADY OF THE NIGHT COURT.I AM COMPLETELY SPEECHLESS AND AM STILL IN UTTER SHOCK AT HOW BEYOND AMAZINGLY PERFECT A COURT OF MIST AND FURY WAS. I CAN\'T EVEN PUT IT INTO WORDS. EVEN A GIF. I JUST-- WOW. YOU GUYS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I\'M FEELING RIGHT NOW. RHYSAND AND FEYRE ARE EVERYTHING I EVER WANTED.THE THIRD BOOK SHOULD BE CALLED ""A COURT OF PAIN AND EMOTIONAL TRAUMA"" BECAUSE THAT\'S HOW IT\'S PROBABLY GONNA GO. HERE COMES THE YEAR LONG WAIT. I DON\'T THINK I\'LL SURVIVE WITHOUT IT LONG ENOUGH. I WANT IT SOOOOO BADLY!!!!!AND I\'M MEETING FUCKING SARAH J. MASS ON THE 14TH AT THE CHICAGO BOOK CON TO GET MY COPY OF ACOMAF SIGNED AND MEET HER IN THE PROCESS! I\'LL MOST LIKELY BE RENDERED SPEECHLESS JUST LIKE AFTER I FINISHED ACOMAF. I AM SERIOUSLY SO EXCITED.I WILL SAY IT AGAIN: A COURT OF MIST AND FURY IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE.""To the stars who listen-- and the dreams that are answered.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Instagram||Threads||Facebook||Amazon||TikTokI almost tossed this down in disgust five times while reading this book. I knew, going in, that it was going to be a massive act of revisionism with regard to Rhysand, the villain of the first book. And as someone who loves villains and thePersephone myththat could have been something I could have gotten behind under the right circumstances. But I wasn\'ttrulyprepared for the narrative gymnastics that this book would perform to try to redeem him without really making him do any legwork. By the end of the book, he\'s still a sleaze lord, only now he\'s a sad sleaze lord in leather pants who was actually the heroine\'s soulmate all along and an all around Nice Guy. Pop a fedora on his head and he\'d probably ""milady"" his way through the Night Court.Big yikes.The beginning of the book was great, and very much in keeping with ACoTaR. Feyre has PTSD (understandable) and so does Tamlin (also understandable) and they\'re trying to heal and find the same love for each other that was the fuel for Feyre to save him under the mountain in the first place. The passion between them in the beginning was great. Feyre\'s misgivings about ruling also made sense. I could even understand why Tamlin would want to be so overprotective. He felt like he had betrayed her in failing to keep her safe and was overcompensating for it in the worst way by essentially treating her like she was made out of glass.Enter Rhysand, who makes good on his bargain to take Feyre back to his court for seven days a month. He actually ruins Feyre\'s wedding, where she is about to get married to Tamlin but having a major case of cold feet and PTSD. He tells her that her wedding dress is ugly and tells her that she should thank him for saving her the effort of breaking things off, because he is *chef\'s kiss* a prince among men. *eye roll* He takes it upon himself to teach Feyre to read and write and is so shocked that she was allowed to be illiterate for so long... which was kind of weird to me, because I was pretty sure that TAMLIN was actually teaching her how to read in book one?? Maybe I\'m wrong, but I seem to remember Tamlin teaching her to read was a major part of his introduction as love interest.Also, apparently Feyre hates painting now and is totally upset that Tamlin gives her a set of paints as a present. Because how dare he get her something that she used to like but didn\'t tell him that she doesn\'t like anymore. How dare he not be a mind-reader like Rhysand who is a prince among men.Anyway, things between Tamlin and Feyre aren\'t so great when she gets back. She starts noticing that he\'s really controlling but they never really sit down and talk about it. She whines about it but never discusses anything with him... and yes, while his behavior isn\'t great, locking her in the tower is hardly the abusive act that Feyre milked for all it was worth. It was bad, yes, but it\'s not like Rhysand was free of faults (oh no, we\'ll be getting to that), and yet his past was wiped so clean it was practically sparkling, while Tamlin\'s smaller crimes are portrayed as the Greatest Wrongs in the History of Wrongs, and you would think he put her up in some kind of prison camp for all that she goes on about Tamlin locking her up and Rhysand freeing her. IT WAS SO ANNOYING.The ""mate"" thing is really just a neat excuse to forgo any groveling while also explaining this seeming switch mid-series between love interests. We learn that Rhysand sexually assaulted Feyre for her own good, to keep her angry so she wouldn\'t give up hope. WOW, WHAT A GREAT GUY. About 370-pages in, he finally brings up the assault and sort-of-but-not-really-apologizes and Feyre merely shrugs it off, despite the fact that in book one, everything he did was infuriating and traumatizing to her, and she HATED his guts and HATED him for parading her around and objectifying her in front of Rhysand, drugged her, mind raped her, and even made jokes about forcing herself on her, but yeah, Tamlin\'s the bad guy because he locked her in her room ONE TIME.It\'s kind of amazing, really, how eager Feyre was to throw Tamlin in the trash.Also, like Celaena/Aelin in THRONE OF GLASS, it isn\'t enough for Feyre to be a bad-ass fighter on her own terms, no. When she comes back with the gifts of the other Lords, she comes back with LITERALLY ALL OF THEIR POWERS, and she is so powerful that people are going to kill her just to keep her powers from manifesting. Because a heroine just isn\'t worth salt if she isn\'t the Queen of the Specialverse, I guess. Part of what made Feyre so endearing in book one is because she actually did have to struggle to succeed; here, everything is served to her on a silver platter.I skipped over most of the Night Court things... they were so boring.Of course, Tamlin has to become a traitor. Maas basically did to him what she did to Chaol and Dorian in THRONE OF GLASS. They both become terribad people so Rowan can show up and steal the scene with his earth-shattering orgasms. I guess maybe even the author realized that Tamlin didn\'t look that bad, so making him into a betrayer was necessary for giving Feyre a clean-cut reason to dump his ass without looking petty. Also, apparently he harbors a sexual assaulter in his court, because in this book we learn that YET ANOTHER WOMAN IN THIS BOOK tried to have her way with Rhys without his consent, and Tamlin just keeps her around... because he\'s the bad guy now.We\'re supposed to feel sorry for Rhysand because he was Amarantha\'s ""whore,"" and yes, I do feel sorry for him... Amarantha was awful... but that doesn\'t excuse his own abuse. ""This is for your own good"" is literally one of the go-to phrases of abusers. He was AWFUL in A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES and he never really grovels for it. He tells Feyre abouthisabuses while crying, but that\'s all about HIM. He provides plenty of reasons-- excuses-- about why he did what he did, but this serves more to brush off his actions than genuine contrition. I wouldn\'t even care if he became her love interest as the villain if he was actually KEPT as a villain, but it\'s like all that brutality gets a pass because he is, in fact, a nice guy. Also, the casual story about what basically serves as an allegory to genital mutilation in his mother\'s court was super disturbing and mentioned like once, but holy yikes-- his parents were fucked up, and I felt like that should have been unpacked more.Lastly... the mental illness rep. Some people apparently think it\'s great. No. I don\'t think it is. Love basically cures Feyre\'s ills. While it\'s true that being in an unhealthy relationship can exacerbate existing mental illnesses and cause ones you are predisposed to to manifest, being in a good relationship is not a cure. You don\'t lose your PTSD or whatever because the sex is good and you\'ve found your soul mate. That is a toxic trope in way too many romances, and I can\'t stand for it. ALSO, what about Tamlin\'s PTSD? This was also never really discussed. Does only Feyre get to behave irrationally and have freak outs? That\'s an unrealistic expectation to have, and her contribution to that toxic relationship was never even discussed... because of course, Feyre is perfect.On second thought, maybe she is perfect for Rhysand. They\'re both selfish trash people.One of the crowning moments in this book is Feyre saying NOBODY HAS SUFFERED OR GONE HUNGRY LIKE I HAVE while a few chapters before she was hating on Tamlin for literally tithing his people until they starve. I guess she\'s the High Lady of Virtue Signalling as well. Fuck the poor people if they don\'t give her an excuse to hate on Tamlin. I don\'t believe they\'re mentioned again.If you forget how perfect this couple is, Feyre and Rhysand will remind you 2342342 times why the two of them are the Faerie Jesuses Incarnate who died and prostituted themselves for your sins.This almost reads like bad fanfiction of the first book. I really don\'t feel like Rhyand and Feyre were destined to be together from the beginning. I felt like maybe Maas initially planned on a love triangle but maybe thought Rhysand was too rough around the edges, and so worked double-time trying to find reasons to excuse all of his behavior and make him supes enamored with the heroine.The greatest death in this series wasn\'t Junian\'s or Amarantha\'s... it was Tamlin\'s character.It isn\'t even like Rhysand is perfect in this book. His flirting is literally saying things to Feyre that most men would get slapped for. He talks to her like one of those sexist asshats inMadmen. He\'s constantly talking about her appearance in a creepy way, and helaughswhen she\'s upset that he used her as bait for the Attor. Even their bargain, which ended up allowing him to read her mind, was done without consent, and he certainly doesn\'t ask for consent every time he reads her mind. At one point, he even says that he could rip her mind apart if he wanted. It\'s almost like this book was written out with the intention of having him still be the villain and Maas changed her mind halfway through.I really couldn\'t stand this book.Rhysand and Rowan are literally the same person, and their ""development"" with the heroine follows the same trajectory. It\'s not the worst book I\'ve read, and it\'s not even the worst Maas book I\'ve ever read, butI will never for the life of me understand why this series is so popular, or why some people who eagerly condemn other books for being problematic seem so eager to forgive or ignore the flaws in this one.Your mileage may vary.1 to 1.5 stars'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'When I finished this book,the mountains trembled.*Do I need to remind you to be civil?

I thought so.Oh well.I‚Äôm going to say this just once: it‚Äôs calledmanipulation.Now look at me, Maas. Do I look like a reader who enjoys being manipulated to you?No? Why,I thought so.To all those who still have to start this series and are intentioned to:don‚Äôt readA Court of Thornes and Roses. Spoil yourself a little of what happens there andstart with this one. Because -and this is the truly sad thing, as someone else said before me-A Court of Mist and Furycould even be enjoyable if the first book had not happened before.‚Ä¢I won‚Äôt go so far as to say that what we have here is a case of lack of ‚Äúshow‚Äù and an excess of ‚Äútell‚Äù, because the first chapters do show that Tamlin, whether for some PTSD or because he has always been a scumbag, undeniably acts like the worst man on the planet. I am even willing to forgive howcaricaturalhis behaviour appears. But, throughout the book, every occasion is a good occasion to throw in a comment tooverturncompletely also all the positive parts of him that are showed in the first book.(In this regard, I should say that inA Court of Thornes and RosesI did not care for Tamlin in any way, so I am not speaking out of frustrated adoration.)In this scenario, Tamlin is the epitome of all evil, while Rhys, of course, the epitome of all good: Tamlin cares for hierarchy, Rhys cares for family and nothing more (ugh); Tamlin wants her caged, Rhys want her free; as it turns out,it was Tamlin‚Äôs betrayal to begin the feud between his family and Rhys‚Äôs, and so on. I am not in any way saying that a man shouldn‚Äôt give freedom to his woman (it‚Äôs not that he should;he must, uncompromisingly), or that a plot-twist like the one I mentioned isn‚Äôt a good turn of events, even in terms of characterization, but everything is just sostereotypicalandtriteandsickly sweet.All of this,in the name of a ship. I think Maas should understand that falling out of love is just as normal as falling in. People fall out of love for normal reasons even if their exes don‚Äôt suddenly turn into maniacs.I am sick of this device, courtesy ofQueen of Shadows, and I don‚Äôt need the new love interest to be pushed on me: I am perfectly able to decide for myself.‚Ä¢I‚Äôve seen some reviews in which these two characters are described as complex and multifaceted on the basis of their role reversal. Allow me to say that, in my opinion,nothing about them, in this book, is complex nor controversial.Maas did nothing more than switch their places and their personalities with them: Tamlin was the good one and turns out to be the villain; Rhysand was the villain (somehow, and indeed the Rhysand of the first book is the one I can honestly call intriguing) and now he is nothing short of a Fae Prince Charming.Simple as that.Besides,I liked Rhysandin this book, butI deeply missed the more wicked, morally grey part of himthat we saw Under the Mountain. He‚Äôs hot, sure, but he also comes off asflatand, at times,pathetic.‚Ä¢It was a dick moveto lock Feure up in the mansion, yes. And yet, I can‚Äôt wrap my mind around Feyre‚Äôs fickleness, considering thattwo chapter latershe says this:‚ÄúI\'m thinking that I was a lonely, hopeless person, and I might have fallen in love with the first thing-thing? Now he‚Äôs a thing?-that showed me a hint of kindness and safety. And I\'m thinking maybe he knew that- maybe not actively, but maybe he wanted to be that person for someone. And maybe that worked for who I was before. Maybe it doesn\'t work for who- what I am now.""She hadevery rightto leave the mansion and let him stew for a while, but if that is the result of months and months of undying love, well. He stopped being worth of her love maybe, but I don‚Äôt think she fought for it that hard either, especially if he really was dealing with some PTSD. I think love is also about trying to fight for the other person even when they don‚Äôt seem to fight for us, to give them time, to give them chances, even though at one point we have to stop.It just would have been nicer and more enjoyable if Feyre‚Äôs affection‚Äôs shift hadn‚Äôt been so swift, that‚Äôs it.‚Ä¢All the contradictions. Feyre leave her abusive boyfriend, but then falls in the arms of a man who breaks every bone of a guy who called her names. Uh-uh. And if you say ‚ÄúHe did that because he called her ‚Äòwhore‚Äô, and he‚Äôd been called whore too, and thetrauma‚Äù, I say: how do you know Tamlin‚Äôs behaviour wasn‚Äôt due to his trauma too. Maybe he just needed time. But it‚Äôs okay if it‚Äôs Rhysand that does that because epitome-of-perfection, remember?Hisbeing all possessive is okay. He can say things like ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs mine‚Äù and snarl at people who so much as look at her. And don‚Äôt get me started on indecent exposure.‚Ä¢Thenew charactersare all nice and pretty and invariably haunted by a dark dark past. It‚Äôs nice to read about them and to witness their banters, but they don‚Äôt stand out as particularly well-written or sophisticated.‚Ä¢Theplotis evenweakerthan Maas‚Äôs usual. And contrary to what I usually do, I‚Äôll sum it up for you: Feyre flees. TheMy Little Ponies gang- ops. I meant the Court of Dreams‚Äô defenders (I know, the ponies were cooler) look for Things. Which do Stuff. Precisely, destroy Taran‚Äôs Black Cauldron and defeat The Horned King, minus the fluffy Gurgi.Well, wrong story, but that\'s basically what happens.In more than 600 pages.‚Ä¢People purr. Normal cats, thank God, ordinarily talk like freaking civilized beings.‚Ä¢The first timeRhysand and Feyre have sex and he climaxes, the mountains tremble. I refuse to comment on this thing, and if it was me who had written such embarrassing idiocy, I would be hiding my head under the sand. Moreover, allthe sex scenesare verycheesy,dramaticandover-written.‚Ä¢Lucien andElain‚Äôs mating bond. I swear on my heart I have never, ever read anything more ridiculous than this scene (oh, no, wait: the mountains). The passage from normal, rational person to mad caveman takes less time than a spark to burn. I almost expected he started hissing ‚ÄúMy preciousss‚Äù.‚Ä¢And yet,I enjoyed it, or better, I enjoyedRhys,Rhys, his long, sappy, tearydeclaration/explanation(I have a thing for this trope; it could have been a thousand times worse than it actually is, and still I would\'ve loved it. I am such a softie, I know. My fault), theending, andRhys. The other things I pretty much despised. I also appreciate the fact that at least the author tried ‚Äìand at some length, I think, even succeeded a tiny bit- to conceive a scenario in which Rhys‚Äôs cuddliness actually makes some sense.I still prefer him wicked.‚ûΩ To sum it up, what can I say? I read it with with ease because of an extremely fluent, even though not particularly sophisticated, writing style, and, as we all know, idiocies and mushy stuff can also be enjoyable, and truly, this book take the concept ofguilty pleasureto a whole new level. Nonetheless, I am sorry, but I can\'t overcome theirritationthat Maas\'s little games cause in me. She used the same lame and unprofessional trick twice now; my trust in her is gone, and I\'m wondering if we should expect a third time too.EDIT29/03/16: Ok, so I read the excerpt -as usual, unforgivably late, but this time the delay is due to the fact that I didn\'t know whether to read it or not. If you want to join the club, you can find ithere.What do I think of it? I simply think that making a protagonist goOOCwith three plain lines does take an inconceivable amount of talent.

I AM SCARED. I\'m totally open to the whole Feyre/Rhys thing, but I love Tamlin so much and I don\'t want him to be ruined by Sarah J. Maas! Can someone please tell her that she can make us love a character without ruining another character?Because really, I ship Feyre and Tamlin, but I will not be mad if SJM handles Rhys\'s and Feyre\'s relationship with cleverness.PLEASE SJM, DON\'T RUIN TAMLIN....And of course, WHAT DID SJM DO? RUIN TAMLIN!I tried to write my review without major plot spoilers, but there will be some minor spoilers about how the characters were handled. And warning: my emotions over this book are a mess, you\'ll se how contrary they are!Anyway... let me begin:OH, I was mad! I was so angry when I started reading this book, because it is in the first chapter that you notice that Tamlin has changed and not for good. Now he\'s an asshole. He\'s insensitive and controlling, I couldn\'t stand him! So congrats, SJM, you made me despise my (now former) favorite character in this series.I read a few reviews that said that Tamlin was always like that (a possessive piece of shit), but NO. HE WASN\'T! He was caring and protective, not a control freak. I feel that Tamlin changed because of everything that happened with Amarantha. Everyone comments on how Feyre had PTSD and Tamlin didn\'t try to understand her, but I think Tamlin also had PTSD. What he went through with Amarantha (and with almost losing Feyre) had a huge toll in him. I can accept that he changed because of that, but no one acknowledges it, not the readers, not Feyre, not even SJM.So that must mean that he just changed because he\'s an asshole (I\'m not buying it).My problem is that SJM wanted to force Rhysand on us, like she wanted to force Rowan on us in her Throne of Glass series. Excuse me, miss, but I don\'t need the love interest to be pushed on me. I can decide by myself. And the thing is... I FELL IN LOVE WITH RHYS IN THIS BOOK! And I think I would\'ve fallen for him even if Tamlin hadn\'t been the piece of shit he was.Before this book, I couldn\'t imagine any possible reason that would make Feyre leave Tamlin and fall for Rhys. Not after everything she went through to save Tam, he was the love of her life and her feelings for him were genuine. But then of course, the author put a lot of effort in ruining Tamlin, just so Feyre could fall out of love. What SJM doesn\'t seem to understand is that falling out of love is normal. It\'s perfectly fine. You don\'t have to turn a character into a bad guy for that to happen. Sarah turned Tam into a villain, and that was not necessary.I also hated the comparisons Feyre was always making between Rhys and Tam, so frustrating! They were so obviously put there only to make sure that the reader understood that Tamlin was evil and Rhysand was good:-""Ugh, Tamlin doesn\'t let me go anywhere. But Rhys lets me do anything I want!""-""Ugh, I had my nightmares and Tamlin never woke up to confort me. But Rhys is always there for me when that happens!""-""Ugh, Tamlin only cares about hierarchy. But Rhys cares about family and about his people!""-""Ugh, Tamlin doesn\'t let me enter to his room. But of course Rhys invites me to his!""...I MEAN, SERIOUSLY? We can notice that by ourselves, but Feyre kept comparing and comparing during the whole book.Have you read the Shatter Me series? It was as if Feyre was Juliette, Tamlin was Adam and Rhysand was Warner... the very same pattern! First Tamlin was a cinnamon roll and suddenly he becomes a bad guy who only thinks about himself and is obsessed with Feyre. And Rhys was the evil guy in the first book but then you discover that he had really good reasons to do everything he did, and he\'s a good guy incapable of commiting any evil. Gosh, I really liked Tamlin, but now I simply can\'t stand him. SJM succeeded!And I had other issues with this book... but that was my main one. I\'m afraid this has become the modus-operandi of SJM.Let me talk about those other issues... starting with Rhys. His character really intrigued me in the first installment of this series, he seemed evil, and I knew there was more in him than what he let us see. I knew he had his reasons to act the way he did, and of course I wanted to know why. BUT THIS WAS JUST RIDICULOUS. He\'s not justnot evil, he istoogood, bordering in perfection. He\'s a saint, he\'s ""Saint Rhys"". There is too much goodness in him. He\'s also the ""most powerful Fae ever born"", see? It\'s unnatural to be that perfect.Another issue was that Rhys seems to be the only High Lord that cares about peace and prosperity. He\'s literally the only one trying to stop the King. The other High Lords don\'t care about humans! The other High Lords are stupid! I feel like SJM did this just to add more perfection to Rhysand\'s character: Obviously he\'s the only considerate Fae that cares about the poor humans, the other High Lords are nothing compared to him!Now let\'s go to the other side of my review (this will be drastic): Despite eveything, I LOVE RHYS SO MUCH! UGH, SARAH! You did it, you made me fall in love with him! Maybe it\'s his good nature. Maybe it\'s his perfection. Maybe it\'s because he reminds me of Warner. I don\'t care anymore... I\'m just really rooting for him. I don\'t know how Sarah does it. Even with everything that bothers me about his character, I couldn\'t help falling for him.And it is rare when I change my ship in a series, but I did in this one because there\'s no way I\'d still ship Feyre and Tamlin after everything that happened in this book (which is sad, because I really shipped them in the first book). Now I can only say that I ship Feyre and Rhys SO. MUCH. Their relationship development was beautiful, everything they went through made their love more real, made it stronger. There is no love triangle here, there are no teams, there are simply Feyre and Rhys and I NEED them to be together.There were only two things I didn\'t like about their relationship. 1)The whole: I DREAMT ABOUT YOU BEFORE I MET YOU....Clich√©, clich√©, clich√©. 2) The ""YOU ARE MINE"" parts. I mean, Feyre left Tamlin because he was possesive and controlling, but all those ""you are mine"" are not exactly different, right? I don\'t like that kind of love. It should not be about belonging to someone, it should be about belonging together.I also love Cassian and Azriel. Everything that happened at the end with them made me a sobbing mess! I just hope Cassian recovershis poor wings!, because if not, I\'ll just go to a corner and cry forever.Now let\'s talk about Feyre. Sometimes she infuriated me because of all the comparisons she made and because she was always complaining about Tamlin not trying to understand her, but she didn\'t really try to understand him, either. Sometimes she was really unfair with himExcept when he locked her up, I would\'ve done the same thing Feyre did. AND NO, I don\'t want them back together (NEVER), it\'s just that she made me really mad sometimes. But in contrast, I think she really grew as a character in this book, she blew me away! The scene with the water wolves was AMAZING. AlsoI cried when the evil creatures attacked Velaris! Ugh, stupid queens!!!...I couldn\'t stand it, it was painful to read. But back to Feyre, I like the directon her character is going.I can\'t wait to read the next installment! I know Tamlin doesn\'t have a chance of forgiveness (I myself can\'t ever forgive him), but I\'d like to see redemption in Lucien, he\'s a character with great potential and in this book he was just too weak.The world building was great, a total A+! I\'m still a little confused about the whole Jurian ordeal, but I hope he gets killed soon :). All in all, this book was GREAT, I think that maybe it was better than the first one, and that\'s saying a lot, because I loved ACOTAR. But since I had way too much issues with it, I could not give it 5 stars. I don\'t know how Sarah does it... she makes me love her and hate her in every book she writes! But it\'s more love than hate, I am SJM trash. She\'s QUEEN.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""I've never been thismanipulatedin my life.I was stripped off my free will until there was only a shell left behind, a puppet complying with her master's whim. This is the most vulgar thingSarah J. Maascould do.Allow me to elaborate.‚Ä¢In order to be candid, I have to admit thatI enjoyedA Court of Mist and Furymore than I expected, and found some redeeming traits that prevented me from rating it lower. However, I can't hide my rage and utter disappointment sinceeverything we read inA Court of Thorns and Rosesvanished into thin air. Remember the sweet love story between Tamlin and Feyre that defied immortal tyrants and resulted in great sacrifices in the name of their love? Well, forget about it. We were warned that this would be aHades and Persephone retelling, meaning the romantic relationship between Feyre and Rhysand would be inevitable. The way, though, Sarah handled the transition wasfeebleandinfuriatingto say the least. I don't think there has ever been a character moremistreatedthan Tamlin, with Lucien following suit. We get it, Sarah cares about her precious baby Rhysand, but her real talent as an author would be to make me choose him because I found something unique in him,not because she forced him down my throat. Tamlin's inexcusable behaviour suffocated Feyre, and I felt drowning and suffocating along with her. Since I couldn't possibly wish for her to stay in a mentally abusive relationship, Rhysand was the deus ex machina, the only one to save the damsel in distress, given that her friends abandoned her and her fiance suffered from split personality. Sarah dangled Rhysand in front of me, and every reader, sayingpick him pick him pick him. She had Tamlin and Rhysand facingidenticalsituations, only for Tamlin to do the wrong thing while precious Rhysand was the impersonation of right, of all that's good in the world. Tamlin locked Feyre? Rhysand set her free. Tamlin forbid Feyre from participating in his activities? Rhysand would always have her by his side. Tamlin extinguished the fire burning in Feyre and left her a hollow version of herself? Rhysand fueled that fire, and so on, so on. Now, I've been on the losing side of a triangle before, but always both love interests had some good qualities. In this case, though, Sarah served you the answer on a silver platter by annihilating the opponent and erasing everything that made the relationship between Feyre and Tamlin good and healthy. Rhysand was always sothoughtfulandconsiderateand knew what Feyre needed, he was her salvation. Of course he was, there was afreaking magic bondbetween them that allowed him to read her thoughts. Even the lesser fae servant in the Day Court would understand her needs if they were bonded. In every chapter she would chantRhysand is so gorgeous,Rhysand is so sexy,Rhysand is the most powerful High Lord in the history of Prythianyada yada.We.Get.It.Don't even get me started on the repetition of the wordmate, I rolled my eyes so many times I fear I might have a permanent problem.‚Ä¢Lucien losing his backbone and Tamlin turning into a psycopath a-hole were not the only character mistreatments, though.Rhysand was the victim of his own creator's adoration.In order to make him the perfect match for Feyre, she made himtoo perfect. Gone is the wicked, morally grey, complex character that intrigued us inA Court of Thorns and Roses. While unveilingthisRhysand, instead of finding shadows and darkness and lust for power, we found asappyand fluffy bear asking for love and affection. Everything he did was out oflovefor his friends, for Feyre and his country, and I fail to accept his reasoning behind his actions Under the Mountain. If you don't want the villain to know how you feel about Feyre, you can simply ignore her. But no, why not drug her, grop her while drugged and humiliate her instead?‚Ä¢Now let's get to the relationship between Feyre and Rhysand. For more than the first half of the book I liked them, with their banters and flirtation and the pent-up tension. But from attraction and friendship Feyre suddenly jumped to declarations of love and thenmountains trembledand she startedglowingand their sex scenes varied between steamy to cringe-worthy and more eye-rolling ensued (I seriously need to see an ophthalmologist).‚Ä¢Plotwise, I can't help but notice that some things were veryconvenient. You suspect the King of Hybern is preparing for war? Let's ask the monstrous ancient creature, who in the span of five minutes will give us all the answers, including the means to defeat the King and the exact location of the weapons to nullify his powers. Wanna convince the mortal queens to give you what you need? Write a mushy letter about your love for Feyre. The result is guaranteed. I mean, really?‚Ä¢Why three stars then, you may wonder. Well,I became very fond of the secondary characters. Mor, Azriel, Cassian and the ultimate Queen, Amren, were funny and caring and loyal, and I was actually more invested in their stories (which, to be honest, were all sob stories). I also enjoyed Sarah'slush descriptions, you could feel and breathe and walk the streets of Velaris, and the Summer Court. But most importantly, I admire the way Feyre's trauma from her experiences Under the Mountain was depicted. The guilt, the sorrow, the self-loathing were tangible, and the healing was slow and realistic. Her wounds would be there, and she learned to live with them. Feyre became a strong woman who embraced her gifts, her powers, her sensuality and ferociously claimed her place alongside men. She rose from her ashes.‚ÄúWhen you spend so long trapped in darkness, you find that the darkness begins to stare back.‚Äù‚Ä¢A Court of Mist and Furyhad great potential, but I can't say I loved it. I'm partially sad because I lost some of my respect for Sarah, for shredding to pieces the characters I loved only to show her own favorites are better. I don't know whether I'll readA Court of Wings and Ruin. Before the last chapters it was a big no, but that final confrontation was the book's highlight for me and now I'm considering to dwelve into the third instalment to find out the end of this story-arc.To all my friends who loved this book, and I know there are many of you, please don't be harsh on me.

Amongst them were Persephone and her story. Yes, my cheesy heart loved that, okay?Persephone was the Bride of Spring, but she was stolen by the God of the Underworld ‚Äì the terrible Hades ‚Äì because he was head-over-heels in love with her. But she hated him with all her being until‚Ä¶she didn‚Äôt anymore. She learned to love his weird-ass too until he became her husband.If this isn‚Äôt the literary world‚Äôs foundation for their enemies-to-lovers theme, then I don‚Äôt know what this is, I give up.Well, this is the exact thing that happens inA Court of Mist and Fury. Rhys gets to be Hades (duh, obvy!) and Feyre is our darling Persephone. My brain started producing serotonin once again because of that tiny little fact some now happy beyond compare.This book is a love statement. Falling in love ‚Äì slowly, truly, deeply, madly in love. And hard. But heart-crying beautiful. And it is not only about two beautiful creatures learning how to love each other and all the states they get through to find that love.This book teaches of how to fall in love with beautiful people, beautiful faces, beautiful minds and beautiful souls. And most importantly, how to fall in love with yourself. How to cherish everything you get to have in order to know how to soothe your life and spirit.‚ÄúBut then she snapped your neck.‚ÄùTears rolled down his face.‚ÄúAnd I felt you die‚Äù, he whispered.Tears were sliding down my own cheeks.‚ÄúAnd this beautiful, wonderful thing that had come into my life, this gift from the Cauldron‚Ä¶It was gone.‚ÄùDon‚Äôt get confused though. This is still a Maas work of art and thus it is still very, very extremely hot. I can‚Äôt manage to launch into an explanation of how hot this book is because it is on fire, okay? And with this, SJM makes out of this book a full emotional experience (an emotional roller coaster better said but oh well).All of my favourite characters from this series make an appearance in this book. If you thought you loved the characters you encountered in the first book, then wait to be blown away by the apparition of the Inner Circle. They‚Äôre precious, deadly soft babies that I would want nothing more in life for them but to be fed, warm, cuddled and loved.-Cassianis the ruffian of my heart, he‚Äôs big and loud and gives off this feeling that he‚Äôll keep you happy and safe no matter what; just love him so much;-Azrielis the baby-bat-guardian-angel of my soul whom I love so much and all I want to do in life is hug him and feed him and protect him from everything and everyone;-Amrenis a scary old bitch whom I love for the simple fact that she doesn‚Äôt seem to give a fuck about anyone but she‚Äôll be ready to defend her friends if it comes to it;-Moris my girl-crush of this series and sometimes I think she‚Äôll be my ultimate wine-drinking bestie; I love her to death;‚ÄúA queen ‚Äì a queen who bowed to no one, a queen who had faced them all down and triumphed. A queen who owned her body, her life, her destiny and never apologized for it.‚ÄùAll those weirdos are like a big, fat present for me, wrapped up in colourful paper and with a bow tied on top. I don‚Äôt know how I managed to go on with my life before I learned about their existence.Now, moving on to more serious, adult-like topics, I want to confess one thing: this book is extremely sensual. It really goes places and I went with it like in trance. The level of sexiness explored here is so intense that it could be made a masterpiece of sensually falling in love. And this is mainly because ofRhys.In this book, I honestly cared more about Rhys than I cared about all of the characters inA Court of Thorns and Roses. He is the sexiest thing I‚Äôve ever encountered in my life and with this, I have discovered, he‚Äôs my type of man, no questions asked.‚ÄúI have known many High Lords. Cruel ones, cunning ones, weak ones, powerful ones. But never one that dreamed. Not as he does.‚ÄùIt feels like he‚Äôs having his own personalised gravitational system and we simply happen to fly around like thebƒÉgƒÉtori-de-seamƒÉthat we are, if I‚Äôm allowed to express myself as Romanian as possible.Rhysand and Feyre's falling in love journey is one of the most beautiful love stories this world could read about. It is so warm, but also so crushing. I love it. It‚Äôs like a most beautifully painted love dream.By the end ofthis‚Äì *vaguely gesturing towards everything ACOMAF is*‚Äì I felt tired, hurt and blurry-sighted.

I was a survivor, and I was strong. I would not be weak, or helpless again. I would not, could not be broken. Tamed.‚ùûA Court of Thorns and Roses was one of the first books I started reading that got me into Fantasy and reviewing books. Way back when this series, the Throne of Glass series, and Sarah J. Maas, herself, wasn\'t hyped up like there\'s no tomorrow. It was the first book I\'ve read by Sarah J. Maas and the reason I picked up the Throne of Glass series because I just needed more SJM in my life.I was satisfied with the way things ended in ACOTAR so when I heard that some ""changes"" were going to be made in A Court of Mist and Fury, I was a little disappointed. I was NOT a fan of the changes that were made in the Throne of Glass series which was why I haven\'t picked up Queen of Shadows yet even though the book has been sitting on my shelf since the day it\'s been released. That\'s just my opinion. I know some SJM fans are going to start pouncing because they sincerely believe that Sarah could absolutely do no wrong. Don\'t get me wrong, I LOVE SARAH J. MAAS. She is an outstanding author. I love her writing, her characters, and the world that she brings to life. It was her books that changed my perspective on Young Adult Fantasy, but I honestly wouldn\'t say that I agree with every direction that SJM takes with her books.I suppose the questions to ask now are: what was my stance at the end of ACOTAR and how did I perceive the changes that were made after reading ACOMAF?Let me address the most important aspect of Sarah J. Maas\'s books, this series, and probably the thing that majority of readers care about the most: THE ROMANCE. Since A Court of Thorns and Roses was a loose retelling of Beauty and the Beast, my ship of course was none other than Tamlin and Feyre. I loved them as individuals and I loved them even more as a couple. AND I loved Rhysand. Just not as a love interest. I felt like Feyre wasn\'t worthy of the enigma that was Rhysand. But knowing the trend that SJM follows in all of her books, I figured a change in love interests was inevitable. After all, a book isn\'t written by Sarah J. Maas if there isn\'t some character butchering and changes in love interests involved.But after reading A Court of Mist and Fury, I actually found myself accepting the transition in love interests much to my surprise. As much as I wanted Tamlin and Feyre to stay together, I knew it wasn\'t going to happen. These two people that survived weren\'t the same people that were Under the Mountain. They\'re relationship became such a nightmare and so unhealthy. It was two damaged lovers waiting for a disaster to happen.In the beginning of this series, I understood where Tamlin was coming from and why he was so protective of Feyre. It was for Feyre\'s own good and nobody wants to lose the people they love and/or care about. But he took it way too far. He became too overbearing to the point where he was holding Feyre back. We all understood the trials and suffering that Feyre had to go through but I feel like people don\'t acknowledge what Tamlin had to go through as well while they were Under the Mountain. It was nothing close to what Feyre had to go through but Tamlin had to watch the person he loved suffer and die. He couldn\'t protect her the way he wanted and he didn\'t fight for her as he knew he very well could have. He was helpless and a coward. I think he realized this, which was why he tried to make up for it afterwards by protecting her now to the point where she\'s being suffocated. It still doesn\'t excuse what Tamlin does in this book but he\'s just another damaged character like Feyre and Rhysand. He\'s just hurting in different ways and expressing that pain in a way the he views would make up for his shortcomings in the first book. Tamlin loves Feyre, that much is evident. He just loves her too much, and that is the tragedy.As for Rhysand, all I can say is that I loved him in ACOTAR and I loved him even more in A Court of Mist and Fury. I loved that we finally get a good understanding of Rhys as a character, the secrets he\'s kept, and the sacrifices he\'s made for the good of his people and his court. He was everything that Tamlin was not and twice the man and High Lord that Tamlin will ever be. I\'m not completely sure if I\'m 100% on board with Feyre and Rhysand yet but I love their chemistry, friendship, and the way they just understand and respect one another. I think I would\'ve been head over heels in love with Feyre and Rhys instantly as a couple if ACOTAR never happened and I didn\'t get so attached to Feyre and Tamlin. But I no longer ship Tamlin/Feyre and I\'m slowly, but surely, beginning to fall in love with Rhysand and Feyre little by little.With romance aside, everything about A Court of Mist and Fury turned out every bit as great as I anticipated a year ago. Sarah J. Maas did not disappoint. I was preparing myself for the worst but instead I got the best. Sarah really knows how to capture her audience with her writing, worldbuilding, and characters that she has created. Of all the new things that were introduced in this book, the new characters of the Night Court were definitely my favorite. I thought the Spring Court was great in ACOTAR with characters like Lucien and Alis but the Night Court was at a whole new level with Cassian, Azriel, Morrigan, and Amren. BADASS is literally an understatement describing these new characters.Besides Rhysand and Feyre, ACOMAF introduced so many new ships and I can\'t handle all the perfectness that everyone is. I now ship Mor and Azriel with all of my being, just putting it out there. XD And Cassian and Nesta. And Lucian and Elain. None for you Tamlin.Overall, I was glad I waited to read A Court of Mist and Fury because as a result, I was able to dive into the story with an open mind about the changes that were going to be made in terms of romance and the direction that Sarah J. Maas was taking the series. Love her or hate her, Sarah can write one hell of a story and is such an outstanding author. Although there were some parts of the book that went by a little slow, I think A Court of Mist and Fury was even better than ACOTAR in more ways than one. Sometimes I find that sequels may suffer ""middle book syndrome"" but ACOMAF amplifies that momentum knowing that Sarah is preparing to hurtle anticipation and suffering our way for the conclusion of the A Court of Thorns and Roses trilogy.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal.I was a survivor, and I was strong.Oh damn. That was so unexpectedly good. And to think I almost didn\'t take a chance on this after not loving the first book...So, here it is: I present to you7 reasons why this book is a million times better thanA Court of Thorns and Roses.1) Less romance.Oh, don\'t worry, there\'s romance. There\'slusty, slow-build, flirtatious romancethat somehow manages to be completely absent from the first book, even though romance was more central to the plot. But there\'s also so many other things here. It\'s a fantasy with romantic elements, not the other way around.I always say I tend to become more invested in love stories when they\'re subplots and the book itself is not actuallyaboutthe love story. I like it when the characters come together around and between all the rest of the action and drama. That\'s what\'s happening here. Because there is a whole shitstorm of other things going on - which, by the way, has led tobetter world-building, more exciting action and reveals, and a fascinating overarching story.2) Feyre\'s growth and development.And, in fact, the growth and development of many characters. Maas spends some quality time on character histories and backstory to strengthen our understanding of them. I absolutely love it when characters show realistic growth over time and I think that\'s especially important with Feyre here.Feyre is not the character she was duringA Court of Thorns and Roses. How could she be after the events of that book? Naturally, she has changed and found that her needs and aspirations have changed too. Once upon a time, back when she was weak and starving, she longed for a strong protector like Tamlin. Now she is strong, and she needs freedom to train her newfound strengths.3) I hate Tamlin.Honestly, if you happen to be a diehard Tamlin fan, I can see this book being a huge disappointment. Luckily for me, I pretty much despised him. He\'s never been anything but apretty-faced control freak. I\'m glad Feyre has seen that and rebelled against it.I should warn you that Tamlin is absent for about 70-80% of this book. And that was just fine by me!4) I love Rhysand.I foresee the ""oh no, it\'s a love triangle"" comments rolling in, but I really don\'t think it is. I actually think this is a great book aboutgrowing up and discovering that you\'re a different personwho longs for different things. I don\'t get the sense that Maas is trying to play out the Tamlin/Feyre/Rhysand angst; she is merely showing a young woman having a change of heart.AND can we just talk about how much better Rhysand is. There\'s all the superficial stuff like he\'sexciting, flirty, dangerousand I love the story behind him. He\'s more fun than Tamlin and I like fun. His banter is wonderful. But I\'m also talking about a more important level. Rhysand is, despite being the ""bad boy"", thoughtful and selfless. He doesn\'t want to stifle Feyre\'s strength and lock her away for her own protection - he wants her at his side, an equal, a partner in crime. And I love that so much.I like men who see value in strong women.5) Less sexual.I\'m sorry, you horny readers, but I just need to put this out there:I really dislike Maas\' sex scenes. Maybe Tamlin had something to do with it but, in general, I think they\'re overwritten and melodramatic. I also think she does a lot of ""telling"" you that it\'s hot, instead of ""showing"" how it is, which is a common writing mistake, but is far worse when in a sex scene. It\'s unconvincing.And by ""overwritten"", I mean that she describes kissing as ""branding"", thrusts as ""breaking"", and sex moans as ""prayers"". Literally none of those things are sexy. She gets the flirtations and banter right - that bit is hotter than the actual sex - but I start to cringe when the clothes come off.A brush of his tongue against the seam of my lips had me opening fully for him, and he swept in, claiming me, branding me.Also, is it really necessary for the male characters to ""growl in approval"" during sex? Not just once - and arguably one growl is one too many - but several times. I\'m supposed to be fanning myself with desire and all I can think about isRoy Orbison\'s Pretty Woman.Mercy. Rawr.6) New characters.A Court of Mist and Furyintroduces many new characters, and the difference between this book and the first is that I found them all memorable, not just the main three characters. Maas has definitely not neglected her characterization and character detailing here. Everyone who comes in and out of the novel has an important purpose, is fleshed out with personality and history, and makes an impact.My favourite was Amren, but I also loved Cassian and Azriel. Our brief introductions to the Bone Carver and the Weaver were highlights too.7) The ending.Take note: this is how to ensure your reader needs to get their hands on the next book. It\'s not a cliffhanger, but it is still EVIL. In the best possible way. I loved everything about it. It\'s the kind of emotional high that leaves you somewhere between wide-eyed horror and smiling gleefully.How will I last a whole year?Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube|Store'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Well, well, well. How the turns have tabled.ACOTAR was, uh...not my favorite book in the world.But there are no words to describe how much better ACOMAF is.All the problems I had with the first book were fixed. The story got bigger and more epic. The romance improved dramatically. And I fell in love with all the characters.This review has spoilers for the first book. Spoilers for ACOMAF will be boxed off with siren emojis (üö®).After the events Under the Mountain, Feyre is understandably traumatized. She saved Tamlin and the Spring Court at the cost of her own mental health. She had to kill innocent Fae to save him. And now she can\'t look at the color red without getting flashbacks. She wakes up every night to throw up.And Tamlin isn\'t helping.He\'s extremely protective of her after Amarantha killed her, even though Feyre was brought back stronger than ever as a High Fae. He doesn\'t allow her to talk to her family or to leave Spring Court land. He goes as far as to lock her in the house so she won\'t try to help the recovery effort in Prythian.And that\'s when she breaks. She calls out for anyone to save her, and Rhysand hears her through the bond, taking her to the Night Court to ride out the storm. But along the way, she realizes that she is more than a figurehead. She has powers, given to her by the High Lords when her body was remade. This book is essentially Feyre\'s journey to finding and accepting herself with Rhysand\'s help.Rhysand, High Lord of the Night Court, is not as he seems. In ACOTAR, we saw the facade he put on so Amarantha didn\'t get suspicious. But the real Rhys is a haunted, traumatized character who hates himself and feels worthless. He\'s exactly like Feyre. An excuse for Rhysand\'s past behavior is given, and it actually makes sense.Their journey to discovering themselves is beautiful, touching, and heartbreaking. And while I do hate Tamlin for being so heartless to Feyre, I can see where he\'s coming from and I don\'t think we should treat him like a villain.He\'s protective of Feyre because he saw her die, and he\'s absolutely terrified of that happening again. So he protects her the only way he knows how--by shutting her inside and not letting anyone see her. And it drives Feyre mad. I think there should have been a Tamlin redemption arc, and I really want to see Tamlin recovering from his PTSD as well. Because they\'re both suffering and they both deserve help. I don\'t want Tamlin to become the villain.However, the signs of emotional abuse and possible physical abuse are clearly evident.- Claws come out whenever Feyre confronts him- Makes her PTSD worse by locking her inside, giving her flashbacks to Under the Mountain- Doesn\'t take her opinions seriously- Doesn\'t listen to her, or kisses her or something to make her shut up- Gives her no responsibilitiesThe mental health rep was outstanding. Tamlin\'s rep was kind of harmful, but Feyre\'s was so raw and emotional and real.She didn\'t recover from her trauma because of love.She recovered because of friendship, and because people actually listened to her and took her seriously. Love was just a side effect.It\'s really the little things that helped. Feyre comforting Rhys during his nightmares and realizing that they were alike. Mor wearing blue instead of her favorite color (red) when she first meets Feyre. The Court of Dreams giving Feyre time to recover when she has a panic attack.The one thing I think this book needs is more diversity. Everyone was white except for this one guy that showed up for two chapters. The caucacity.üö®üö®üö®SPOILERS AHEADüö®üö®üö®I did not like Rhysand\'s character after Feyre discovered the mating bond.This may have something to do with the fact that I don\'t like the idea of ""mates."" They\'re essentially soulmates, if you\'re not familiar with SJM. I always felt uncomfortable with the overprotectiveness that comes with the term and the kind of animalistic ring to the word itself.I actually really, really loved Rhys\'s character before he and Feyre were mates. He was so suave and intelligent and witty. That is, until the mating bond snapped into place. And then he was insanely overprotective and I just don\'t like that in a character.üö®üö®üö®SPOILERS HAVE ENDEDüö®üö®üö®Another rap, because why not.

There\'s too much that happened and (whew) I am just wholly overwhelmed with everything.We last left Feyra as abroken shell of a girl- she survived trials and the hardships but her mind wasn\'t the same.

I just want to fill this review up with the heart-eye emojis.Minor spoilers will be included. You've been warned.This book is incredible. This book is important. But before I get to that, this book was a massive, gigantic improvement on ACOTAR. They're not even the same two books. Or they are, but ACOMAF elevated this series to what it deserved and needed to be.The world was epic, detailed and grand and I never wanted to leave. Everything about it clicked. I was absolutely transported into a world that I became obsessed and enthralled with. The pacing was beautifully slow, but well paced and the build up was great.So, the story line picks up right where it left off, with Feyre and Tamlin being back in the Spring Court, and now having to suffer from PTSD and anxiety. I absolutely love how SJM explored this and showcased how they were both affected by what happened in the events of the last book.Now, I was afraid that Tamlin's character was going to be completely bashed and written off since readers were hating on him and since I really liked his character in ACOTAR, that had me worried. But as I read on, the progression with his character made sense. As much as I loathed how he became, it's understandable and true to real life. His PTSD took on a different form. Sadly, that form became more emotionally abusive, manipulative and controlling. It was almost unbearable to even read. It was ugly but it needed to be there.Feyre just lost herself. She didn't know who she was anymore. Her trauma unfolded in a way that changed her completely and led her to who she truly needed to become.I absolutely loved how SJM incorporated those aspects into the story and how Feyre grew and continued to beautifully grow throughout the book. Facing setbacks, but ultimately, finding herself and her voice again. That 'human' element made it so relatable and warm. And the depth that SJM went into for both characters was impressive and you couldn't help but be invested and feel a strong sense of empathy.But what I loved more than anything was that SJM showed what a healthy and unhealthy relationship is. What to stand and not to stand for, depending on the standards you've set for yourself and which ultimately, you decide for yourself. 'Twas fuckin feminist as fuck, whilst also incorporating what true friendship and a healthy and loving relationship can do for your worth. To ultimately put your wellbeing ahead of everything so you may recognise the signs of an imbalanced relationship.And Rhysand? I need him in human form. Sometime soon, universe.This book just has so many fantastical and realistic elements to it. I loved that we were able to take something a way from it, enjoy it, and I'm even happier that SJM decided to extend this series.

If you have problems with swearing, do not read this review*Buddy read with my partners in disappointment:Katerina&Vera. Yay, we are freed from under the Mountain at last! And a special hug goes to my dear friendSimona(click on the names to see girls\' reviews) You were right, dear, reading this book and, especially, discussing it is so much fun, indeed.First of all, let me show to you a simplediagram, where you can see how the level of my engagement toward this book...uh, plummeted (actually I wanted to make the diagram more vertical, but, well, I am not good with graphic stuff) with every chapter until nothing was left for me to enjoy.And let me tell you it was a rather bumpy and painful ride.Now, let\'s clarify a few things:- I am not a fan of ACOTAR. You can see inmy reviewwhy.- I had few expectations starting this book... ah hell, I had THE ONLY expectation - Rhysand.-I do not hate this book, I dislike it.<----- I am close to hating it now.This review is probably going to be a mess of thoughts with no structure, so I am sorry in advance if it\'s confusing, I just wanted to splash out my disappointment.I liked Rhys in the previous book; I liked his darkness. I knew he was not evil and had his reasons to act as he did, and I wanted to know why. I wanted him and Feyre together. But turns out, me and Rhys are never going to happen, not because he acts OOC (out of character) - after finishing the book, I know that he didn\'t act OOC - I dislike his sugary nature; there\'s too much goodness in him, he is practically a Saint: hell, he is the Saint among Fae!‚ÄúWe are lucky to have him, Feyre.‚Äù I turned from the door. ‚ÄúI have known many High Lords,‚Äù Amren continued, studying her paper. ‚ÄúCruel ones, cunning ones, weak ones, powerful ones. But never one that dreamed. Not as he does.‚Äù‚ÄúDreams of what?‚Äù I breathed.‚ÄúOf peace. Of freedom. Of a world united, a world thriving. Of something better‚Äîfor all of us.‚ÄùOf course, the other High Lords are stupid, they don\'t see the war coming, they are not interested in peace and prosperity, only Rhys does everything, and no one wants to listen to him.Poor baby.And let\'s not forget he is the strongest Fae out there.Here‚Äîhere was the most powerful High Lord ever born.The face of dreams and nightmares.Only throughout the book, there was more than one situation where his ""mighty"" powers let him down.The question: why make him so powerful, impossibly so, if a little bit of vulnerability could\'ve made him more real and likable, and suited the plot better. It\'s unnatural to be that good. He became a cardboard character with no backbone and lives only to serve Feyre, it seems.But, fuck, it wasn\'t even my biggest issue. I hated how Maascompared Tam and Rhys in this book all the time. I never liked Tam, but, seriously, how much shit you can splash on one person before he turns into shit himself? I pity Tam and what Maas did to him. Time and again Maas shoves down our throats how Rhys excels Tam in everything: Tam didn\'t want to talk to Feyre about his nightmares. Rhys wanted to talk and share. Tam never held her hair while she vomited her guts out every night (she does it a lot, by the way, nauseatingly so). Rhys held her hair and cuddled her:He never woke when the nightmares dragged me from sleep; never woke when I vomited my guts up night after night. If he knew or heard, he said nothing about it.Large, warm hands pulled my hair back a moment later.‚ÄúBreathe,‚Äù Rhys said. ‚ÄúImagine them winking out like candles, one by one.‚ÄùI heaved into the toilet again, shuddering as light and heat crested and rushed out of me, and savored the empty, cool dark that pooled in their wake.Tam locked her up in the house and forbade her to participate in any action. Rhys allowed her to do whatever she wanted. Tam didn\'t let her visit his rooms. Rhys invited her to his;With Tamlin, he‚Äôd kept his own rooms and slept in mine. And I supposed‚ÄîI supposed it‚Äôd be the same.I was almost to my bedroom door when Rhysand drawled from behind me, ‚ÄúWe can use your room if you like, but ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù He was leaning against his open bedroom door. ‚ÄúEither your room or mine‚Äîbut we‚Äôre sharing one from now on. Just tell me whether I should move my clothes or yours. If that‚Äôs all right with you.‚ÄùTam is starving his people. Rhys\'s people prosper (he probably gives them food for free). Tam said there are no High Ladies in Prythian. Rhys made Feyre High Lady of Night Court. Comparisons were in EVERYTHING like the author couldn\'t stop shoving up our asses how Tam is lesser than Rhys in every aspect you can think of. And all this is solely for Feyre to make it easier to dump Tam and switch to Rhys.Then there\'s Feyre and herlovesex life. Feyre said that she fell for the first guy who showed kindness to her.I‚Äôm thinking that I was a lonely, hopeless person, and I might have fallen in love with the first thing that showed me a hint of kindness and safety.But she can\'t - wouldn\'t - admit that it wasn\'t love that she felt for Tamlin. She, time and again, repeats it was love: she loved and sacrificed and then forgot the guy in two months\' time. I would\'ve respected her more if she admitted that it was lust.He buried his face in my neck and said onto my nape, as if the words would be absorbed by my body, as if he could only say it the way we‚Äôd always been good at communicating‚Äîskin to skin.Whyfeel guiltyabout wanting another male? But no, Feyre is Mary Sue, she can\'t be the simple girl who had a change of heart. She loved but had serious reasons to fell out of love.Easy-peasy. Heck, I would\'ve respected her more if she was an elite prostitute serving High Lords and choosing her next lover without shame or labeling lust as love. But she is a hypocrite and Ihate hypocrites. It leads me to my next issue.Feyre/Rhysand. Honestly, I don\'t believe Tam loved Feyre, no, they just had a comfy agreement: fuck but don\'t ask questions. Rhys, on the other hand, I believe he really loved her. What about her? No. I am still not convinced it was love from Feyre\'s side; lust - yes. Again,Feyre has a pattern: when Rhys was a bad guy, she hated him, but when he started doing good stuff for her, she realized how good he is, how kind (don\'t forget this all is in comparison with Tam like we are stupid kids and can\'t fathom the universal truth: Rhys is good, Tam is bad);Feyre doesn\'t ""love"" Rhys despite his flaws, she ""loves"" him because he has no flaws.Mr. Purrfect Perfection. And when she finally admits she wants him, she still acts like a hypocrite by saying, ""But I loved Tam, deeply, I just don\'t any longer, because he treated me badly (I still don\'t get how splashing some paint on walls and locking her up once is abusive and the reason to easily fall out of love)."" Did you love him indeed? I want to ask for the thousandth time. Feyre just says she loved him to find an excuse to fuck Rhys. And that leads us to theirmating bond.When Feyre finds out they are mates, she relaxes and thinks, ""Fuck, what a relieve now that I know Tam and I was never going to happen, I don\'t have to feel guilty any longer for wanting to fuck Rhys"". But before we cover the mating process, let\'s touch on the snotty conversation they had. If you still had any doubts before that Rhys is a Saint, believe now that he is. He is a miracle reborn. Attention: he was always kind to Feyre even when he was a dick toward her. He loved her already when they were under the Mountain, he knew they are mates, it wrecked him to hurt her; he was jealous of unworthy Tam, but Rhys was noble and didn\'t want to ruin Feyre\'s life. And that sloppy melodramatic speech of his continues for a whole chapter!""A Court of snort and boredom""as someone on GR called it once (sorry, I don\'t remember who said that or I\'d hug this person). And again, Rhy\'s goodness is shoved down our throats *gags*Mate.My‚Äîmate.This beautiful, strong, selfless male ‚Ä¶ Who had sacrificed and wrecked himself for his family, his people, and didn‚Äôt feel it was enough, that he wasn‚Äôt enough for anyone.Also, as we are on the topic... did you noticehow many times the phrase""my mate""is repeated in the book?!Hundreds of times! It\'s like a broken record player. I think if I hear ""mate"" one more time I may vomit like our Feyre-parrot does all the time.They fuck. It\'s a disaster of epic proportions. Mountain quacked. MOUNTAIN. QUACKED. Seriously? What was that? Some kind of cheap shapeshifter porn?Okay, When they are done, and I am done yawning, and we all move to civilized surroundings... wait, what the fuck is happening?!Rhys acts like an animal, he can\'t stop wanting to screw Feyre. Their mating bond makes them horny as fuck. He is so protective of his female. It\'s serious stuff among Fae folk, they could even kill if another male looks sideways at their females.‚ÄúThe ‚Ä¶ frenzy,‚Äù he said carefully, as if fearful the wrong word might send us both hurtling for each other before we could get sustenance into our bodies. ‚ÄúWhen a couple accepts the mating bond, it‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ overwhelming. Again, harkening back to the beasts we once were. Probably something about ensuring the female was impregnated.‚Äù My heart paused at that. ‚ÄúSome couples don‚Äôt leave the house for a week. Males get so volatile that it can be dangerous for them to be in public, anyway. I‚Äôve seen males of reason and education shatter a room because another male looked too long in their mate‚Äôs direction, too soon after they‚Äôd been mated.‚ÄùFaeries - cunning, highly intelligent, powerful creatures act as if they are primitive animals from a cheap porn novel. After Rhys loses some steam fighting his buddy, he goes and fucks Feyre against the table. Everyone outside hears and knows. Wonders! How civilized they are indeed! Are we supposed to find these animal games romantic? Does it suppose to be a healthy relationship?And this book is labeled as YA and published by Bloomsbury Children\'s!It is NA (new adult) or erotic at the very least!My next issue - the plot. First of all, let\'s not delude ourselves there\'s something more to the book apart from theromancemating.The plot is a crutch for the romance.Everything characters do, they do between Rhys\'s and Feyre\'s courting. And even these parts are poorly executed. Why, oh why, does Maas need to chew everything for us?! We are not stupid, we can get hints and would like to have some space left for the imagination.Show, don\'t tell.Show us through hints and glances, make us work for information; make us want to know! And the plot itself is primitive: go there, do that - monotone routine with no unexpected parts. 50% into the book and I have already known how everything would end.I don\'t understand the half-orgy scene in the Court of Nightmares where Feyre and Rhys were almost fucking while everyone watched. It was a distraction while the others were stealing something important. It\'s so stupid I can\'t even. Maas couldn\'t think of something smart for distraction, rather than thisdisgusting humiliating scene?! The best part is the ending, though. Why would mortal queens conspire with the King of Hybern? Because they want immortality? They\'ll get their immortality but will be slaves. Would it be worth it? I don\'t think so. And why demonstrate the experiment with humans turning into Fae twice? Wasn\'t one time enough, when Feyre\'s sister Elain was made into Fae? Why make the same with Nesta? Because it serves Maas\'s idea of making Feyre\'s sisters immortal and finding mighty mates for them. It doesn\'t matter that the plot looks illogical and stretched - everything is ideal for Maas\'s grand plans. Tam is a traitor because he wants Feyre back. Why, he is a reborn villain now! How stupid it is to betray your country, because of the woman who doesn\'t want you? Why villains in this book so villainous? Why there\'s no depth to them? Good is good, bad is bad. End of conversation.This book is 640 pages long. 640 pages of unnecessary descriptions of clothes, Rhys\'s goodness, Tam badness, Feyre\'s vomiting, mating, getting from point A to point B. 640 pages of parading High Lords to who I wouldn\'t trust to rule a swamp, let alone whole Kingdoms. Where\'s the smart and cunning in this book? And what kind of place is Night Court? Is it a mix of East and West and the modern world? Lace underwear, seriously?! Why does Night Court resemble so much human reality? Is this another point to Rhys\'s goodness? I have tons of questions toward this book, but I don\'t think getting my answers will somehow make it better. It\'s late for that.I wouldn\'t say there wasn\'t anything good about the book for me. Compared to Rhys and Feyre I liked secondary characters, and Cass and Nesta as a couple attract me more than Rhys and Feyre ever will. It\'s sad I am not interested in learning more about them in the context of this series.When I started this book, I practically had no expectations, and now I am angry. Angry at the book I wasn\'t even sure I would read in the first place! It\'s a new low. If this book was an erotic novel or NA, I would say, ""Good, we had sexy time"" - and move on. But this book pretends to be something different than it really is. Something more meaningful and deep, and it cruelly deceives people into thinking they are going to read a fantasy YA with a strong plotline and character development. They will be surprised to find an entirely different beast here. I am glad I am finally done with this series:no more, never again, burn in hell, book.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Re-read via audio!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '""When you spend so long trapped in darkness, you find that the darkness begins to stare back.""Yall... this book... this book and its hype... this book and its hype and all it\'s spoilers;\xa0had me worried.\xa0On\xa0top of all that\xa0I\xa0feared that this book, all 600 plus pages, would suffer a massive case of second book syndrome.

Since this book was broken up in several sections I\'m\xa0going to basically break my review down by that.A Court of Mist and Furyis the second book in theA Court of Throns and Rosesseries. This book starts off right where ACOTAR ended. Feyre, however, isn\'t recovering well from what happened to her under the mountain. It doesn\'t help that Tamlin basically avoids talking about it at all cost and he insist that she never leaves the estate. Being trapped in the house just\xa0wedding planning, with no friends, no family, and waiting for the moment when Rhys comes to claim her for their deal. Feyre is a broken girl the first part of this book. Not knowing where she stands or where she wants to be.

That\'s all I\'m really going to say about the first\xa0section\xa0of this\xa0book.The next part of this book we finally get a lot of\xa0the answers we\'ve been dying for!

We are also introduced to so many new side characters... Which easily\xa0became some of my all time favorites. Mor, Amren, Cassian, and Azriel brought everything to this story! I loved that Rhys decides to surround himself with the best of the best, say F the people who don\'t see females as badass, and puts two fierce girls as part of his inner circle. Cassian and Azriel, be still my beating heart. I loved these two. What interesting characters. Each with such a unique back story.\xa0This part of the book was all about build up and setting the stage for the ending.\xa0This is why it took me awhile to get through this book... but trust me get through it, its so wroth it.The last part\xa0of this book... God give me strength! I don\'t know how I\'m even going to get through the rest of this review. This section of the book was everything I ever wanted!

There were also so many things that\xa0I thought were minor details in the first book that\xa0turned out to be huge reveals in this one.\xa0I was also so worried that the ""love triangle"" aspect still hanging in the air that it would end up ruining things for me. I can\'t not address it, and I swear it\'s not a spoiler, but allthe romance in this is PERFECT. It\'s also why this book is so much bigger than the first, because it\'s so full of sexy fun times.This book is hot, HOT! I really don\'t get how this book is still categorized as Ya, I think this jumped right into NA. Seriously, so yummy! I have for sure gotten on the same ship as everyone else.The ending. So much happens. It was so amazing. Shit hits the fan! I did not see it coming. I knew one thing that was going to happen, because you can\'t not see it, but the rest of it had me on the edge of my seat. I kept screaming ""WTF"" The whole time.

I\'m frozen in 35646 layers of disbelief and I\'m trying hard not to explode from the sheer impossibility of this flawless story I\'ve read. I read, read, read, and read until I reached the Acknowledgements page and knew for sure that I finished the best book I\'ve read in like... an eternity.The story is simple, really. It picks up right where it left off inA Court of Thorns and Roses.Feyre is living in the Summer court and is going to marry Tamlin. But things have changed since she has turned into High Fae, an immortal body but with a human heart: She has to stay by Tamlin\'s side and be his trophy, left with nothing to do but paint and plan her wedding with Tamlin, High Lord of the Spring Court. As she grapples with the horrors she\'s had to endure Under The Mountain against Amarantha, she also awaits Rhysand, with whom she struck a bargain to visit his Night Court for one week every month.A Court of Mist and Furywas magical. Angsty. AndDamnably beautiful.Theplotwas so tangible, I didn\'t want to get it over with. Theromancewas so tantalizing, I felt my heart pound frantically in my chest. Theambiencewas soalluring, I struggled to take my eyes off it. And thetwistswere sounexpected, I was forced to gawk and stare at the ceiling, due to relief or stupefaction, I don\'t know. I was thoroughly enchanted in a world filled with intrigue, magic, lies, and secrets and I feel weighed down by the depth of it.Sarah J. Maas\'s writing is the literal definition ofmagnificent.She creates a world so captivating and lets you drown in waves ofwonderand intrigue,enigmaand appeal. Her words are powerful, heavy with conviction, articulate, and relevant. I can\'t thank her enough for delivering this masterpiece and much more. And for introducing me to two of the best characters I can\'t stop fangirling over.Rhysand.High Lord of the Night Court; Beautiful, brutal, and powerful. He appears to be cold and arrogant initially, occasionally cracking jokes about his beauty. He is surrounded by an aura of sensuality and vivacity and he handles even the direst of situations with grace, casually yet courteously. He is as dangerous and ferocious as he is subtle and generous. He hides behind a mask of savagery and manipulation, trickery and deception but beneath the mask, he\'s kind and humble, a High Lord who cares for his people more than he deigns to express.Feyre.Our strong protagonist who develops from being oblivious in the first book to someone who didn\'t need to be coddled, pampered or protected, who didn\'t cravestabilityandcomfort, orluxuryandeasiness. She hates being judged based on her human life. She can be compassionate, affectionate, and loving, but she can also be vicious, seductive, and cunning as she sees fit. Extremely short-tempered and sometimes provocative, she makes for her shortcomings by being powerful, warm, and unbelievably loyal (Ironic, as she keeps calling herself atraitor)I really liked Tamlin inA Court of Thorns and RosesI thought I\'d be devastated by not seeing him with Feyre. But the author made it easy for me to dislike him as he wanted to lock Feyre up, keep her as his trophy and suffocate her by being overprotective.""Love was balm as much as it was poison""The reason why Feyre had been hopelessly in love with Tamlin could\'ve been because of the fact that she was lonely and desired company and so fell for the first person who showed her a hint of kindness and offered commiseration and safety.Whereas Rhysand was different, he gave Feyre the freedom to choose what she desired and believed in her capabilities. He soundlessly, silently, fought for her. A perfect gentleman.""He locked you up because he knew- the bastard knew what treasure you are. That you are worth more than land and jewels.The story also shows us how much our first impression of people/ things could be wrong in the form of role reversals in the male protagonist. Rhysand, who I once perceived as a manipulator, liar, and a ""shameless flirt"" unveils his identity mask and shows how considerate and sacrificing he can be for the people he cares about. I\'m glad I could see a whole new depth to his character, that despite being hard as a shell on the outside, he too had moments of weakness wherein he needed consolation.The book was in support of feminism andequality.It also shows how one can go to any extent to protect their friends and loved ones whilst also exemplifying thatyou can choose your family.Cassian, Azriel, Amren, and Mor were amazing support systems and I\'d give anything to meet them in real life.I could keep going on and on about it, but I think I will peace out for now. üòÅ‚úåÔ∏è'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I don‚Äôt even know what to say.

The most prominent one though, the one that glows with the fire of a thousand suns, is how‚Äîeven as a cheasy, romantic fairytale‚Äîthis book is more painful and human due to themes of trauma and mental health than both its predecessor and its inspirations:Beauty and the BeastturnedHades and Persephone.‚ÄúTo the stars who listen‚Äîand the dreams that are answered.‚ÄùWith anexpanded yet still fairytalish (meaning less defined rules) world,emotional, dramatic, flowing, thread-of-thought writing, andnew, captivating, and steal-your-heart-stab-you-in-the-dark characters and dynamicson top ofthemes of depression, abuse, and post traumatic stress disorder, ACoMaF really has much to talk about.Shall we begin to dig in?‚Äú[I knew that] I would never be a gentle grower of things, or someone who burned like fire‚Äîbut that I would be quiet and enduring and as faceted as the night.

So before I discuss Feyre‚Äôs mental health issues and their representation, I‚Äôm going to address those two groups of people.‚ÄúI am drowning. And the more you do this...you might as well be shoving my head under the water.‚Äù‚û§Do Tamlin‚Äôs choices come out of the blue?The answer is a simple no, and here‚Äôs why: Even inA Court of Thorns and Roses,Tamlin was a controling, aggressive, uncommunicative person who did not know how to truly listen or speak, how to be considerate and open. This makes sense because not only was he not taught any of those traits, he also experienced trauma and abuse growing up.He is extremely emotional and has no idea how to control those emotions, all while having learned to ignore his feelings because only ruthlessness equals survival and efficiency. This is unhealthy for a myriad of reasons, least of which is the fact that,no matter how willfully and insistently you turn away from your emotions, they never go away‚Äîclosing your eyes so you might not see them doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt there, it just means they‚Äôll pounce on you in your greatest moments of weakness and you simply won‚Äôt see them coming.‚ÄúThe issue isn‚Äôt whether he loved you, it‚Äôs how much. Too much. Love can be a poison.‚ÄùTamlin is lonely and broken and living behind a wall of mistrust and fear, not knowing how to tear down that wall nor even acknowledging its existence. I have a couple of friends who struggle with Borderline Personality Disorder and, while I don‚Äôt want to diagnose anyone here, he actually reminded me of one of them. I will elaborate, bear with me.‚û§Is Tamlin‚Äôs arc unnecessary and unrealistic?That is a straight up no, because of the aforementioned friend. Much like my friend, Tamlin neither wants to acknowledge that he needs help, nor does he want to be vulnerable enough toacceptanyone‚Äôs help. Do I think he is broken beyond repair? No, no one is broken beyond repair.Our scars, however ugly, are what make us beautiful, and the cracks in a broken glass can be filled with gold, healed to become something new.But do I think he could‚Äôve healed in this book with the help of Feyre and Lucien? Again no, because of two reasons.‚ÄúThere is the darkness that frightens, the darkness that soothes, the darkness that is restful.‚Äù I pictured each. ‚ÄúThere is the darkness of lovers, and the darkness of assassins. It becomes what the bearer wishes it to be, needs it to be. It is not wholly bad or good.‚Äù‚ù∂ I‚Äôve personally grappled with mental illnesses for years and have friends both online and offline suffering who I‚Äôve walked this path with, dragged back from the edge of suicide, and given help and solutions to when they hurt themselves and others so they could heal. I‚Äôve also made a very, very unhealthy choice again and again and put aside my healing to be everyone‚Äôs full-time therapist. Anyone who was in pain? I would roll up my sleeves, telling them to come seek me out whenever and for whatever, and put all my energy in the ring when they did.Now, I‚Äôve learned something from my online big sis Cath:You areno one‚Äôs therapist(unless that‚Äôs your job ofc). And Feyre did what she could to give Tamlin the space and support he needed, but she was also suffering herself and it‚Äôs cruel and infuriating to expect her to completely forget about her own pain and force him to heal when he isn‚Äôt truly accepting or seeking help. Which is the 2nd reason.‚ÄúSweep it under the rug, like everything else.‚Äù‚ù∑It‚Äôs one thing to support and help a friend towards healing, and it‚Äôs another thing toheal them. You can‚Äôt save a drowning man who refuses to take your hand. You could jump in, grab them, and swim to shore‚Äîbut there‚Äôs a high chance they would drown you, too, in their attempt to get you off them.Again, I have done this, and it‚Äôs wrong because not only was I taking away their choice and saying that I know better (which I don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs their life) I was also risking them drowning me‚ÄîI don‚Äôt much care about this, let me drown who cares, but it‚Äôs not healthy behaviour.Still, I‚Äôve done it, put life and breath and soul into showing those drowning friends why they should seek a hand to stop their drowning and learn to swim, and I‚Äôve failed as many times as I‚Äôve succeeded. That friend I mentioned Tamlin reminded me of? She‚Äôs one where I failed, and all I could do was watch her in pain as she lashed out and inflicted pain on others, and try my best to do damage control with her victims‚Äîbecause theywerevictims, as Feyre clearly is one.A victim of abuse rooted in ignored, festering pain, twisting a caring, passionate soul into a source of suffering.‚ÄúThere are good days and hard days for me‚Äîeven now. Don‚Äôt let the hard days win.‚ÄùNow that that is out of the way, how about Feyre‚Äôs struggles?‚û§Above all else, this book is a love letter to healing.I can‚Äôt personally vouch for the PTSD (which I found accurately written based on what I‚Äôd learned of it from others‚Äô experiences), but I can tell you about depression. And I can tell you how heartwrenchingly Feyre‚Äôs suffocating blanket of silence that cruelly embraced her and hauled her beneath the sea resonated with me. I will leave the exploration and healing to Sarah J. Maas. Thank you.Friendship:Why We Need Support to Heal‚û•Rhys, Mor, Amren, Azriel, and Cass Vs.

Just to buy me some damned peace.‚Äù#relatable‚ú¶Rhysandmight not be my number one (or two, or even three) character in this series, but that does not mean I don‚Äôt love him, it just shows how many amazing characters grace the pages of this book‚Äîbecause Idolove him.He might be arrogant and teasing and always seem in control, but underlying that facade is a deeply rooted insecurity and self doubt.They do say the most seemingly arrogant people in the room are the least confident ones (I mean, I hope they do and I didn‚Äôt just creates a saying out of the blue).Confidence means believing in yourself even as you mess up, and Rhys might be arrogant but he‚Äôs not confident‚Äîhis every mistake and misstep are worms he lets devour him from the inside out. And he does make mistakes, because he is not perfect, just as no one is; he is a person who, in his drive to protect and give and give andgivefrom himself until he is bled dry, tends to occasionaly refuse to share what he knows and others should be informed of. What‚Äôs most important though is howhe accepts, apologises, and learns from his mistakes because what he values most is freedom of individuals to choose the path they want to walk.‚ÄúYou remain your own person. You decide your fate‚Äîyour choices. Not me. You chose yesterday. You choose every day. Forever.‚Äù‚ú¶Amrenwith her no-nonsense, practical, I-will-sooner-kill-you-than-coddle-you attitude is my real number one, because this unyielding Tiny Ancient One would tear the world to pieces to fight for what she holds dear‚Äîthough you wouldn‚Äôt guess what it is she values with her general cutting reply to everything around her.‚ÄúI once lived in a place where the opinion of others mattered. It suffocated me, nearly broke me. [...] with enough courage, you can say to hell with a reputation. You do what you love, what you need.‚Äù‚ú¶Mortakes the spot as my 2nd fave right next toAzriel; where one is fire and boldness and charisma, the other is ice and silence and an enigma, and both will have your back and front and sides all the way to the threshold of death‚Äîand beyond. And then there is babyCassianwith his insufferable arrogance and heart of marshmallows that will push you and be there to catch you if you fall. (I need to add that I will take my hope for a polyamorous relationship between these three with their complicated, enchanting dynamic to the grave and hold it close through whatever comes next).‚ú¶ But why are they so important to Feyre‚Äôs healing?Because you can‚Äôt heal alone. I‚Äôve tried it, and the road is rockier and more precarious without a shoulder to lean on and a hand to hold.I‚Äôm still learning to not cringe at taking a hand to walk the path (and failing, not gonna lie) but I nevertheless appreciate how breathtakingly SJM writes these journeys of recovery every. damn. time. You need friends to heal, and you need to help friends to heal.‚ÄúI wonder if, even in my despair and hopelessness, I was never truly alone. I wonder if I was looking for this place‚Äîlooking for you all.‚Äù‚ú¶ That‚Äôs whereLucienfails. I love him and his loyal heart, but sometimes you need to check your loyalty‚Äîsometimes the people and values you are holding on to are breaking something rare and fragile.That‚Äôs the precise issue with Lucien: He does not understand the depth of Feyre‚Äôs pain, if he had, he would‚Äôve fought without backing down, getting up each time he hit the ground, because my baby is not a coward. Alas, people don‚Äôt ever really grasp another‚Äôs invisible pain.Romance:Where Love Can Bloom(SPOILER ALERT)‚û•Instalove or Slow Burn, featuring Feysand‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking, that I look at you and feel like I‚Äôm dying. Like I can‚Äôt breathe.‚ÄùRhysand and Feyre are not my fave couple as their dynamic is too sweet and romantic for me personally. However, it takes nothing away from howyoufeelthem fall in love, like a flower blooming and a freezing pair of hands finding colour next to the miracle of fire, or like the warmth and light of a familiar embrace you fall into in a world of cold, dark unknowns.Some readers accuse the mating bond of being instalove in the case of Rhysand falling for Feyre. Did they read chapter 54? Rhysand fell for her as she was a human surviving Under the Mountain, and everything he did before that was him trying to save an innocent girl he suspected of being his mate but did not specifically feel anything towards.In the end, mayhaps this book is too romantic for me, the aromantic with a heart of ice, to ever be my #1 book of all time, it nonetheless makes a comfortable and cozy den in its corner becauseA Court of Mist and Furyis a fairytale that takes the dashing princes and magic, and replaces it with human suffering and healing.‚ÄúYou think I don‚Äôt know how stories get written‚Äîhow this story will be written? I am the dark lord, who stole away the bride of spring. I am a demon, and a nightmare, and I will meet a bad end.

It was all anyone could talk about. And five years later, Pip sees how the tragedy still haunts her town.But she can't shake the feeling that there was more to what happened that day. She knew Sal when she was a child, and he was always so kind to her. How could he possibly have been a killer?Now a senior herself, Pip decides to reexamine the closed case for her final project, at first just to cast doubt on the original investigation. But soon she discovers a trail of dark secrets that might actually prove Sal innocent . . . and the line between past and present begins to blur. Someone in Fairview doesn't want Pip digging around for answers, and now her own life might be in danger.","[{'rating': 5, 'content': 'Yesss! The BBC series adaptation is announced to be released on Netflix on August 1st! It‚Äôs a date! Cannot wait!Applause! Applause! Applause! This book offered one of the quickest and most exhilarating roller coaster experiences the moment I laid my hands on it. I‚Äôm still shaky, incoherent (I‚Äôve even requested a translator to articulate my thoughts properly), my nails have seen better days, and I‚Äôm both confused and dizzy. But I‚Äôm also smiling and filled with happiness! I wholeheartedly give it a perfect five out of five mysterious shining stars!The storytelling is exceptional, the plot keeps you hooked, the character development is fantastic, the pacing is fast and heart-pounding, and the ending is immensely satisfying. What are you waiting for, folks? This book won‚Äôt just fall from the sky into your lap. Go ahead, buy it, and send me thank-you letters for my encouraging words!We have an incredible heroine in Pippa (don‚Äôt mistake her for Pippi Longstocking). Fitz-Amobi is a talented, smart, nerdy, funny, social, friendly, brave investigator who stands somewhere between Nancy Drew and Veronica Mars, a slightly older version of Harriet Walsh, possessing technical skills but without tattoos, leather, or chains, a more restrained version of Lisbeth Salander, and a younger version of Dana Scully without Mulder and alien conspiracies!The blurb is tempting, intriguing, and immediately pulls you in, making it hard to let go of the book, as I found out. My dogs are even jealous of the book, barking at the moon in protest, but I couldn‚Äôt put it down, as it‚Äôs one of those books that grabs you from the very first page.Five years ago, Andie Bell went missing, and Sal Singh, who committed suicide after confessing to her murder in a text message, was presumed responsible. Yet Andie‚Äôs body was never found. The case was closed, but Pippa is determined to reopen it for her school project. She starts by interviewing Sal‚Äôs 20-year-old brother, Ravi, who naturally becomes her partner in crime. Their project evolves into a mission to prove Sal‚Äôs innocence and find out who might have really killed Andie.As they dig deeper, Pippa‚Äôs list of people of interest grows longer, even including her best friend‚Äôs sister.There are numerous burning questions in your mind: Who truly killed Andie? Is Andie really dead? Did she deserve her fate? Because as we learn more about her, we discover she was a bully, a drama queen, a drug dealer, and a blackmailer. Her less-than-stellar attributes made me want to give her a piece of my mind. It‚Äôs strange because I‚Äôve never felt the urge to confront a presumed dead person‚Äîor someone I‚Äôm not even sure is deceased! But this character is a living, breathing (or not) scoundrel!Who framed Sal? Did Sal actually do it? His portrayal as a nice, humble, angelic guy led me to nickname him Castiel, like the angel from ‚ÄòSupernatural.‚Äô But we can sense he‚Äôs been hiding something. His friends changed their testimonies regarding his whereabouts and the time he left their gathering, refusing to be his alibis. So where was he at the time of the murder?Who was sending threatening messages to Pippa, trying to stop her investigation?I devoured this book, and my detective skills failed me completely until the final pages. The author always stayed ten steps ahead of me! I feel blessed to be outsmarted by her brilliant writing. I can already picture this as an amazing YA mystery movie or a limited Netflix series (anything to replace the third season of ‚Äò13 Reasons Why,‚Äô which might as well be titled ‚Äò13 Reasons Why Did You Even Make a Third Season?‚Äô).It was an emotional, enjoyable, nail-biting, mind-bending, thrilling, and ultimately satisfying read. I savored every page, every clue, and every heart-pounding moment of this book. I highly recommend it! It‚Äôs even better than ‚ÄòOne of Us Is Lying.‚ÄôAnd the best news is there are three more sequels to look forward to! I‚Äôve already started my excitement dance, which is a blend of Beyonc√©‚Äôs ‚ÄòAll the Single Ladies‚Äô moves and John Travolta‚Äôs ‚ÄòStaying Alive‚Äô grooves. Yay!medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""You heard it here first, folks. I have found a newfavorite YA Thriller. I am stoked by how much I loved this!!For her Senior Capstone Project, Pippa Fitz-Amboi, an extraordinarily-focused high school girl, decides to solve a murder.Andie Bell, disappeared five years ago from Pippa's hometown; foul play was suspected.The police, and thus everyone else, believe Andie was murdered by her boyfriend at the time, Sal Singh, who subsequently disposed of the body.Their biggest piece of evidence, a purported confession Sal texted his parents, days after Andie disappeared. This confession was sent just prior to Sal's death, an apparent suicide.In spite of this, Pippa does not believe in Sal's guilt. Andie's body was never recovered and there is no real physical evidence linking him to her disappearance.Pippa is such a great character. She's an overachiever, who works tirelessly towards achieving her goals.You can tell, once she sets her sights on something, she will not give up and that's exactly how she tackles her Senior project.I think one of the things that connected me so much to this story was Pippa. I found her super relatable and loved reading from her perspective.She ends up befriending Sal's younger brother, Ravi. That additional commitment to him, and clearing Sal's name, makes Pippa even more steadfast; in spite of very real danger.Additionally, the format of this was creative and engaging. The use of mixed media sources, including the transcripts for the interviews from Pippa's investigation, and a present day narrative, made me feel like I was a part of the action.As Pippa is evaluating what she has learned along the way, she recaps things, as you actually would if you were working on this type of project; including a running list of current suspects tracked on her murder-board.The stakes were high and there were times Pippa was legitimately in very real danger. Through it all, she stayed true to herself and fought for justice for Andie and Sal.I loved this so much, as I said. I could go on for many more paragraphs of all the positive attributes of this story, but don't just take my word for it, PICK THIS UP!!!If you love it even half as much as I did, you're in for a good time! Well done by Holly Jackson. I am so excited to get more mysteries from her!!!""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '""Who do you think I am, an amateur?""Move aside, Nancy Drew! There\'s a new teen detective in town. And she won\'t rest until she\'s unearthed all your secrets and gotten to the bottom of a mystery that has long held her town captive.Pip never truly believed what all of Fairview has accepted: that Sal Singh murdered his beautiful and popular girlfriend Andie Bell and then killed himself. Five years later, Pip is a senior in high school, and decides for her final project that she\'s going to find out once and for all what really happened that night.I\'m always in the mood for a good whodunnit. Give me a small group of suspects, everyone hiding secrets, more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at, and red herrings galore, and I\'m in heaven. I loved putting on my detective cap and puzzling out the clues alongside Pip as she investigates and solves this mystery.For me, in order for a mystery to be successful, it has to be so riveting that there is no room for me to think. Once my mind gets going, it has this annoying habit of supplying me with random unsolicited guesses, some of which inevitably turn out to be right, and ruining the surprises. So it\'s best if I\'m so taken with the story that I\'m only surfacing to turn the pages as fast as I can. And this story was exactly that.I grew up on Nancy Drew, and have been looking for an older version of that for as long as I\'ve outgrown it. And how wonderful that this story turned out to be all that I\'ve been looking for and more. Pip is clever, spunky, and fearless, the perfect teen detective staring down secrets and murderers. And the fact that this is a series means I won\'t have to say goodbye to her just yet.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:#2.Good Girl, Bad Blood#3.As Good As Dead~~~~~~~~~~~~‚úßConnect with me‚úßInstagram‚úß'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Rating: 1 star.Genuinely asking myself why I read this. This book had it all - bad writing, a completely unrealistic plot, white savior trope, ""I\'m not like other girls"", and probably the most annoying main character I have ever read about.For some reason, this teenager is allowed to start a massive murder investigation, where every possible witness tells her everything without her having to work for it, and - of course - she ends up doing what the police couldn\'t. The whole premise was just so unrealistic and unbelievable that I was annoyed from the very first page.The mystery itself was also barely a mystery at all, the pacing was off, things made no sense and everything was terribly convenient. Pip kept making random decisions and suspect basically everyone until she finally guessed the right person. At that point in the book, I was just counting down how many pages I still had to suffer through.Pip had no personality traits aside from her constant need to save everyone because she was such a good person and better than everyone else, which the reader was reminded of every second page. It\'s never explained why any of these people talk to Pip and basically tell her their entire life stories, or even why she cares enough to launch this entire investigation. Her character has no development and at the end of the novel, she\'s still exactly as annoying as she was on the very first page.I wish I hadn\'t read this, it clearly wasn\'t for me and a massive waste of time.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""can i sit at the cool kids table?i enjoyed a popular book. i think i'm well past due my invite at this point.this is a fun book that is sometimes really repetitive and sometimes really boring and only has half of a satisfying ending, and yet it's still a quick read.that is literally all i expect or desire from a popular YA mystery.bottom line: i'm going to read every book in this series until i ruin it for myself <3""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""This was good but just good.I think I'm getting too old to suspend my disbelief.

So naturally, she decides to focus her senior capstone project on her small town\'s most buzz-worthy, unsolved crime: the murder of Andie Bell. What begins as a simple proposal quickly turns into an in-depth investigation full of unexpected twists and turns. After teaming up with the alleged murderer\'s brother, the pair spiral into a web of danger and obsession, and quickly wonder if they\'ve gotten themselves in too deep.This debut reads as if you are investigating alongside the main characters, and fans of true crime podcasts will rejoice in the multimedia formatting that so wittily engages the reader from beginning to end. If you enjoy a grounded, engaging mystery that features a diverse cast, discussions surrounding racial injustice, and the importance of found family, I cannot recommend this book highly enough.

Here me out I got my reasons ü´£So I had a lot of fun reading it, the mystery surrounding Angie and Sal was really awesome. Pip and Ravi are likable characters and with intriguing personalities. The amount of work Pip put in to unravel the mystery was commendable and it's all for a school project üòÖIt's awell written and extremely well thought out book,no doubt, so kudos to the author there. Also the way she exposed racism via characters like Stanley is something I really liked. Let's be honest, people like him still exist. That was the only part in the book where the author was realistic...Cmon you expect me to believe a school girl solved this murder case when the big guys police, detectives can't do shit. I get there can be some sort of corruption involved in cases but no way a school kid is solving a murder that complicated without the consistent assistance of someone with experience. I don't care how intelligent Pip was, it's justextremely unrealistic.Also, it was kind of a bummer that Ravi didn't get that much of time in the book. I wanted to see him involved more often.Don't even get me started on the dog. Thelast 100 pages were really wild.So much happened, so many exposed and new questions arising. Am keen on starting with the next book already.It's definitely worth checking out but it's not anything special. Maybe the expectations got to me but I would suggest to anyone who reads this for the first time- go in with lowered expectations. I personally believe thatFive Survivewas the better book.~‚Ä¢~‚Ä¢~Y'all.. Am gonna do itü§û Really hope it's worth the hype""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""Well, it appears, I've been reading YA mysteries all wrong these past years. Evidently, I should not expect plausibility, believability, character development or strong motivations in these books, like I do when reading adult mysteries. No wonder there is only ONE teen mystery that I think is good, and actual teens don't even like reading it, from what I hear. (It'sSadiein case you were wondering).A Good Girl's Guide to Murderstarts off as a Serial rip-off, with upstanding Pippa swooping in Sarah Koenig-like to clear the name of a poor brown guy accused of the murder of a popular girl whose body remains missing. You see, it's only Pippa who believes in Sal's innocence, and she will save the day, because she is a GOOD GIRL and Sal was once nice to her years ago! I was already annoyed at that point.However, from there this story devolves into a sleuthing adventure where Pippa manages to have every Tom, Dick and Harry confess all their misdoings to her, because PIPPA IS WRITING A SCHOOL PAPER ABOUT THE MURDER. She catphishes people, breaks into houses, blackmails drug dealers, discovers 5-year old evidence in plain view, because she is just so much better than the police at everything. I can understand why police wouldn't care to pursue a case of aWho Drew The D!cks or The Turd Bulrglarvariety, but a suicide and a presumed murder? And the victim is still missing and nobody but Pippa cares? Have you heard of Natalie Halloway? She disappeared 15 years ago, and she is still on TV. The whole investigation was one giant eyeroll for me.Anyway, to put it short, this book has nothing that I look for in a mystery. I am not reading any more YA mysteries if suspending disbelief entirely is the main requirement to get through them. I am just going to stick with Courtney Summers from now on. Thankfully she has another one coming out next year, and it's about cults!""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""The dad wouldn‚Äôt allow boys in the bedroom but was fully OK with Pip going on unsupervised co-ed sleepovers‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.The best audiobook of the year!

She is so smart and such a good detective, and she can solve mysteries in the amount of time that it would take for me to even start collecting the clues.

He\'s so loyal and seeing him try so hard to prove his brother\'s innocence is just so amazing, just showcasing his determination and passion. I also ADORE the fact that he\'s not afraid to show his emotions; like I\'ve read a lot of books about stone-cold guys who don\'t show emotions, like their grumpy and blah blah blah but Ravi is definitely not the grumpy one, I\'d say Pip is more of the grumpy one if that\'s the case, but Ravi tries hard to be sunshine and rainbows and I love it üëëü´ÖFUCK MAX HASTINGSI love Pip\'s friends (except for two people), they\'re just so fun and have a wide range of personalities üòÉYeah I didn\'t really care for them much, except I did really love Cara.‚ÄúThey were each other‚Äôs crutch to lean on when life got too much to carry alone.‚Äù‚àò‚ó¶ ‚úÇ ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì‚úÇ ‚ó¶‚àòThe RelationshipsNow, there wasn\'t really much of a romance but it\'s kindaquiteobvious where one ""friendship"" is headed, so you\'ve been warned if you don\'t wanna see.I loved Pip\'s relationship with her family, it felt real and authentic, and they were all so cute, as well as her friendships, they were all just so loyal.All of those are insignificant in comparison to Team Pip and Ravi, my dream team. They mesh so well together that it\'s actually insane. They are the ONLY romance I have ever accepted in murder mysteries, which is saying a lot because I actually despise despise despise romances in murder mysteries, so these two are waaay up on a pedestal that even I can\'t reach right now.Also, the nickname Sarge is the cutest thing ever.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a team, remember.

But Pippa knows Sal is innocent, so she decides to find out what happened five years ago and whoreally killedAndie Bell.Pippa discovers that Andie had many secrets, that she was not the beautiful and tragic victim that the people of Little Kilton martyred and idolised, branding Sal Singh a murderer and a monster, treating his family very badly for it. In addition, Little Kilton holds even more secrets that intrigue Pip and make her want to keep digging to solve the mystery.Writing.I don\'t think I remember reading a book like this, with diary-like entries speaking in first person and then in third person. It was a bit strange, if I\'m honest, and it took me a bit longer to adjust. However, it was an easy read in some respects. And, I don\'t know if it\'s because of the difference between British and American English, but there were phrases that I had to look up because I didn\'t understand them, lmao.Plot.The plot kept me glued in my seat, not wanting to put my phone down, wanting to know what would happen next. I mention that I was late with this book because college is eating me alive, though I made time to keep reading because I was consumed with thoughts of not knowing what would happen, who the killer would be and if Pip was going to find out. There are a lot of plot twists that I wasn\'t expecting and a lot of things that made my brain almost melt from thinking about it so much.Pacing.It was a quick and light read, and I take back that I was late because of college: I would have finished it sooner if it weren\'t for homework. It\'s not that complicated to understand and the pages turn very quickly.Characters.Pip is a good girl, addicted to homework and determined to solve the Andie Bell case and prove that Sal Singh is innocent at all costs. So eager is she to find out what really happened, that she finds herself lying to others so that they won\'t worry about her and try to stop her from abandoning her project.Ravi is the younger brother of Sal Singh. He has been the target of criticism, and is known as the brother of Andie Bell\'s killer. Ravi knows his brother is innocent, and when Pip shows up at his door asking him a few questions, he thinks it\'s a joke. And soon, Ravi becomes Pip\'s partner in crime, both looking for answers about his brother\'s sudden death and his innocence in the case. Ravi is a beautiful little baby, don\'t touch him I want to take care of him.Also, Ravi: marry me.Andie was a bitch and it doesn\'t surprise me much that bad things happened to her. Everyone held her in such high regard, believing she was a good girl whose boyfriend murdered her. Andie ruined several people\'s lives, and although I thought I would feel bad that she had died, I didn\'t really. When you find out the truth about Andie Bell, what she did and didn\'t do, you don\'t feel any empathy for her.Cara is Pip\'s best friend, her older sister is Naomi, who was in turn Sal\'s best friend and who also keeps a big secret that makes Pip dig very closely into her and her life, including her family.(Bonus and unnecessary fact:Cara translates from Spanish to English as: \'face\' and \'expensive\'.Unnecessary examples:Sucaraes hermosa= her face is beautiful. La camisa escara= the shirt is expensive.) Follow me for more unnecessary Spanish classes, they are free of charge.Pip\'s family is ok. They\'re the typical caring and normal family. Tho I loved Vic\'s jokes, jsjsjs he laughing at his own jokes (just as Ravi) is totally me.Max Hastings can die and I wouldn\'t care for him. He deserves the shit going on in his life. He\'s a dick and you can easily see it. Please, go fuck yourself, you fucking bastard. ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏èoK, PEOPLE, SPOILER SECTION. YOU\'VE BEEN WARNED.‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏èTho I loved this book, I really enjoyed and liked it a lot, there were many ??? things that left me with a bitter taste on my mouth.First of all, Pip felt a little bit dry and typical. She\'s a good girl who starts to lie for her project and she doesn\'t feel the same anymore. I mean, idk, I can\'t put it into words, I just hope she felt morerealand not flat.Second, how quick all of the possible suspects told Pip the truth, when they lied to the police or omitted information. I found it quite unbelievable and a little bit ilogic. Also, Mr. Ward confessed really quick and it felt dry... I don\'t quite know how to explain it, but I was expecting more. Becca Bell also confessed really quick, and spilled her secrets out as she were talking about the weather, which also felt a little bit bitter.aND THE FINAL STRAW: BARNEY. NO. NO. NO.

Ustedes saben que llevo tiempo interesada en leer thrillers y este me lo hab√≠an recomendado un mont√≥n, luego vi las rese√±as y termin√© por convencerme, ¬°no me arrepiento!Pippa, la protagonista, es un ser f√°cil de querer, jajaja. S√≠ siento que a veces era demasiado impulsiva y no med√≠a las consecuencias de sus actos, pero a√∫n as√≠ solo quer√≠a que todo le saliera bien. No s√©, como protagonista me pareci√≥ din√°mica y divertida y carism√°tica, en ning√∫n momento me cans√© de seguirla en su investigaci√≥n :). DIGO, s√≠ llegu√© a pensar que estaba llevando las cosas muy lejos, pero se me hizo un personaje tan bien construido, que sus acciones ten√≠an sentido (tipo de: ""¬°eso es tan Pippa!"").AWWW, adem√°s no me esperaba al inter√©s amoroso y, aunque la historia no se centra para nada en el romance, se me hizo una parejita s√∫per bonita AND I WAS ROOTING FOR THEM.El elemento principal de la historia es el misterio y est√° s√∫per bien llevado. El libro te atrapa desde el primer momento y es imposible de soltar. Adem√°s, a m√≠ me pareci√≥ poco predecible. Ten√≠amos a varios sospechosos y TODOS POD√çAN SER CULPABLES. Todos ten√≠an sus razones muy fuertes. ¬øY adivinen qu√©? Obviamente no le atin√©, jajajaja.Eso s√≠, no s√© si continuar con la trilog√≠a porque creo que este libro termin√≥ muy bien as√≠.

No es que hubiera le√≠do muchas rese√±as positivas ni nada por el estilo, perome daba esa sensaci√≥n misteriosa que algunos libros te dan y sabes que necesitas leerlo y que te va a gustar.Sab√©is a lo que me refiero, ¬øno?EnAsesinato para principiantestenemos una trama que sinceramente me ha sorprendido muy positivamente.Losthrillersjuveniles de este estilo, a lo Natasha Preston o incluso Sara Shepard, suelen quedarse a veces un poco en la superficie de todo. Bueno, quiz√° no es la superficie, pero s√≠ queme suele faltar un poco que me construyan mejor todo. Y es que Holly Jackson no escatima en detalles.A ver,el libro te agarra desde el primer momento.Yo normalmente leo el primer cap√≠tulo de un libro para decidir si va a ser mi pr√≥xima lectura o no, y en este caso es que llevaba p√°gina y media y dije pOR DIOS, S√ç, ESTO TIENE QUE SER M√çO.El estilo de la autora hace que te introduzcas de lleno en la historia, y lo mejor de todo, es que no es solo unthriller.Para que un libro de estas caracter√≠sticas funcione, o por lo menos para m√≠ es esencial, tiene que tener una buena protagonista con la que conecte, entienda y quiera luchar por ella. Pip es as√≠.La construcci√≥n del personaje no es algo accesorio, al contrario. Holly Jackson se centra bastante en tener una protagonista muy definida, conociendo detalles de su vida privada, relaciones con amigos y dem√°s.No hace que el ritmo del libro bajey no hace tampoco que te impacientes para descubrir qu√© est√° pasando en el pueblo. La manera en la que Jackson maneja el espacio entre escenas me ha gustado mucho.No es muy normal para m√≠ ponerle 5 estrellas a un libro de este g√©nero. No s√© por qu√©, la verdad, peropuedo recordar pocas ocasiones donde unthrillerme haya volado la cabeza tant√≠simo.Pero es que enAsesinato para principiantestenemosuna historia que est√° perfectamente hilada, que se desarrolla lentamente pero con decenas de giros, y que te atrapa cada vez m√°s porque se va convirtiendo en una locura cada vez m√°s incre√≠ble.De hecho, le han visto el incre√≠ble potencial que tiene y los derechos audiovisuales han sido comprados. Esperemos que la cosa fluya y tengamos a Pippa y Ravi en la gran (o peque√±a) pantalla, porque de verdad,este libro es incre√≠ble.Tenemos toda la trama de misterio, sobre qu√© pas√≥ con Addie Bell y Sal Singh, cuyas averiguaciones van poni√©ndote los pelos de punta cada vez m√°s.Los m√©todos para descubrir mentiras o verdades a medias de Pip son de aplaudir, porque es una chica muy inteligente y que no le tiene miedo a nada: tan solo persigue la verdad y la justicia.Una de mis cosas favoritas del libro es lowokeque es la autora.Pippa tiene un padrastro -al que llama padre- de origen nigeriano, su nuevo mejor amigo es indio y una de sus amigas es lesbiana. Y dir√°s: ‚Äú¬°pero la protagonista sigue siendo blanca! ¬°Es una privilegiada!‚Äù Y as√≠ es. Y, de hecho, es tan as√≠ que hasta ella misma lo dice.Hay situaciones de racismo en el libro en las que Pippa habla sobre tener privilegios por ser blanca, sobre c√≥mo puede tener actitudes racistas pese a haberse criado con un padre negro‚Ä¶Me ha encantado que en un libro de misterio aparentemente solo de eso, se debatan o comenten este tipo de temas sociales.Tambi√©n se habla de machismo, abusos sexuales‚Ä¶En general, es un libro con temas de actualidad, y quiz√° la excusa para tratarlos es el misterio. (Aunque tampoco es que la cr√≠tica sea una pieza central, no nos confundamos.)Sin embargo,con lo que m√°s me quedo deAsesinato para principianteses con la pedazo de trama de Holly Jackson y c√≥mo est√° organizada. Os prometo que es incre√≠ble la cantidad de capas que tiene la historia, la cantidad de personajes relacionados‚Ä¶ Es que sigo sin palabras.Qu√© maravilla.Ahora solo queda esperar a ver si traen el segundo pronto a Espa√±a, porque si no‚Ä¶Amazon, is that you?(Tambi√©n os digo, que me da mucha rabia hacer la rese√±a sin spoilers. Se me queda corta comparada con todo lo que quiero hablar, pero no quiero joderos la experiencia.

But Pippa Fitz-Amobi thinks that Sal is not the killer. She chooses this case as the topic for her final year, Senior Capstone Project. She is trying to find the mystery behind Andie Bell\'s case. Was Sal the real killer? If not, is Pippa\'s life in danger? Will the killer try to hurt Pippa so that she won\'t be able to solve the case? Holly Jackson will answer all these questions through this book.What I learned from this book1) What is hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia?This is an interesting new word I learned from this book. Its meaning is fear of long words.‚ÄúPip knew a great many things; she knew thathippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobiawas the technical term for the fear of long words.‚Äù2) What happens to all the missing people?The author shares some interesting statistics related to the missing people in this book. This will help us to know what actually happens to the missing people.‚ÄúI found these statistics: 80% of missing people are found in the first twenty-four hours. 97% are found in the first week, and 99% of cases are resolved in the first year. That leaves just 1%. 1% of people who disappear are never found. And just 0.25% of all missing persons cases have a fatal outcome.""3) What is toxic productivity, and how can it hurt our life?Few of my friends and patients are obsessed with watching productivity videos on YouTube. Productivity is always good in our life. But when it reaches such a level that we always try to be productive in all areas of life, it might reach toxic levels. Are the online productivity gurus hurting people\'s lives instead of helping them? This serious question can only be answered after more profound research and understanding.The author indirectly mentions toxic productivity in a couple of areas in this book.‚ÄúWhat\'s wrong with me? ... I might seem like the ideal student: homework always in early, every extra credit and extracurricular I can get my hands on, the good girl and the high achiever. But I realized something just now: it\'s not ambition, not entirely. It\'s fear. Because I don\'t know who I am when I\'m not working, when I\'m not focused on or totally consumed by a task. Who am I between the projects and the assignments, when there\'s nothing to do? I haven\'t found her yet and it scares me.""‚ÄúYour efficiency offends me.‚ÄùMy favourite three lines from this book‚ÄúHalf less of a bad thing meant there was room for half good.‚Äù‚ÄúThe people you love weren‚Äôt algebra: to be calculated, subtracted, or held at arm‚Äôs length across a decimal point.‚Äù""But sometimes remembering isn\'t for yourself, sometimes you do it just to make someone else smile. Those lies were allowed.""What could have been better?If you are someone who attended Med School, you will know how some patients try to avoid Med School students saying that they are not Doctors even after knowing they will be Doctors in a couple of years.If we look at the world from the angle of the people I mentioned above, it will be difficult to believe that a teenager is going for an important murder investigation like this, and almost every person connected to it treating her like a real grown-up police officer/ detective and fully cooperating with her and telling her everything they know. It, in fact, looks totally unrealistic from any practical human being\'s point of view.Rating3.5/5This is a real page-turner with many twists that will satisfy most of the readers.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîYou can also follow me onInstagram ID - Dasfill|YouTube Channel ID - Dasfill|YouTube Health Channel ID - Dasfill - Health|YouTube Malayalam Channel ID - Dasfill - Malayalam|Threads ID - Dasfill|Twitter ID - Dasfill1|Snapchat ID - Dasfill|Facebook ID - Dasfill|TikTok ID - Dasfill1'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""3.5/5 ‚úßÔΩ•Ôæüi have finally finished this and i'm not sure entirely how i feel - i think i'm going to give it 3.5 stars for now? i definitely enjoyed it, but the ending was a little... i don't know maybe i wasn't following as closely as i should of? ìç¢÷¥‡ªãüå∑Õô÷íÔ∏∂Ô∏∂Ô∏∂ ‚äπ Ô∏∂Ô∏∂Ô∏∂‚†Ä‡≠®‚ô°‡≠ß‚†ÄÔ∏∂Ô∏∂Ô∏∂ ‚äπ Ô∏∂Ô∏∂Ô∏∂‚ï∞‚îà‚û§Plot:This was overall enjoyable, it was YA so I didn't feel a gripe in my stomach (but I did in Five Survive). The stakes didn't feel that high - this is for sure more murder mystery than thriller. It was very addicting though and did not see the first big plot twist coming at all. A lot of the points Pip (the main character) though 'oh that's suspicious!' - I think a normal person wouldn't have thought that and all. I get that's the point of her character, she 'overthinks', finds leads and chases them down like a bloodhound. To me, whilst this book discusses some really important topics, I didn't find it thrilling.I also didn't guess who did it, but I was hoping Sal would have a bigger part to play, considering how him and Andie's relationship is pictured?.I know I've just trashed on the plot so you might be wondering why it's still such a high rating -‚ï∞‚îà‚û§Characters:All the characters were loveable.Pipis your typical quirky and super intelligent female YA MC. She grows on you, especially her relationship with her family. She started to annoy me in some parts - and she seemed tohave a bit of plot armour.Raviis so incredibly sweet and funny I could picture the flirting in my head.We didn't see too much of any other characters, but it all felt like typical high school to me.‚ï∞‚îà‚û§World/Setting:This... was OK. I could kind of picture the different places she was talking about, the places of interest - it wasn't particularly like amazing or adding a sense of dread. Compared to Five Survive, the world didn't feel as vivid. It does the job though.‚ï∞‚îà‚û§Pacing:This is where the book really shines. Holly Jackson is so good at creating addicting page turners. I couldn't put it down, even if some points frustrated me at times and I cringed at others.‚ï∞‚îà‚û§Enjoyment:I'm not the target audience for this book, so I didn't expect to give it 5 stars here. However, I did enjoy this book a lot. To me it felt like a fun detective story, I wasn't trying to solve anything because too much information was being thrown my way. The banter between Ravi and Pip is really cute, and I did enjoy reading about her family.Overall, I would recommend this!Ô∏∂Ô∏∂Ô∏∂ ‚äπ Ô∏∂Ô∏∂Ô∏∂‚†Ä‡≠®‚ô°‡≠ß‚†ÄÔ∏∂Ô∏∂Ô∏∂ ‚äπ Ô∏∂Ô∏∂Ô∏∂reading log ÀèÀã ‚ô° ÀéÀä12/05/2024 10:32am ‡≠®‡ßéokay listen i'm at 91% and i did not expect this i thought it was all wrapped up12/05/2024 8:07am ‡≠®‡ßégood morning everyone - time to finish this book! it's very addicting and i'm invested in the ending, i truly have no idea who's going to be the culprit11/05/2024 7:34pm ‡≠®‡ßéalright i keep flipping the pages, but with so many 'suspects' im starting to get lost11/05/2024 11:58am ‡≠®‡ßéokay so i‚Äôm trying to figure out who fits into the *everything is not what it seems* category and so far my guesses areravi & cara honestly - just because i‚Äôve heard so many people rave about the plot twist10/05/2024 9:12am ‡≠®‡ßéoh this is has racist idiots in itÔ∏∂Ô∏∂Ô∏∂ ‚äπ Ô∏∂Ô∏∂Ô∏∂‚†Ä‡≠®‚ô°‡≠ß‚†ÄÔ∏∂Ô∏∂Ô∏∂ ‚äπ Ô∏∂Ô∏∂Ô∏∂pre-reading ÀèÀã ‚ô° ÀéÀähello! this has been sitting on my shelf for the longest time and I thought I'd finally buy into the hype after absolutely loving five survive - i need to know what all the fuss is about!may tbr:‡≤á.salt to the sea‡≤á. powerless‡≤á. house of earth and blood‡≤á. everyone in my family has killed someone‡≤á. bride‡≤á. listen for the lie‡≤á. she's not sorry‡≤á. love on the brain‡≤á. the familiar‡≤á.a court of wings and ruin+a good girl's guide to murder""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Not really a guide tbh, more of a WHAT NOT TO DO WHEN YOU'RE INVESTIGATING A MURDER ü§≠""}]"

for the love of all that is holy, use!!an!!inhaler!! someone‚Äôs lips were always twitching into a smile, or someone was snorting/ chuckling/ blinking/ eyeing something or someone, or paedyn was being called ‚Äúvicious little thing‚Äù by kai - which only succeeded in me receiving fourth wing flashbacks. kai was always flicking paedyn‚Äôs nose for no given reason, and one or the other was constantly in a ‚Äúthrong of people‚Äù. plus, the inner monologues were also the most repetitive things i have ever read which really helped make the book incredibly long and boring, with the pacing losing to a snail in a 500m run. it‚Äôs filled with so much banter and such eye-rolling dialogue that after a certain point, you begin to wonder how on earth the mcs would cope without hearing themselves speak, as well as so many trope-centred and pointless scenes.if you don‚Äôt believe me yet, screw you and read this list of tropes:knife/dagger/arrow to the throat (every other page), enemies to lovers (not on a single page), insta lust, slow burn, who did this to you, she's so smol, forbidden romance, cleaning each other‚Äôs wounds, comforting after a nightmare, the most unnecessary love triangle (only one love interest has a pov), some stupid trials that have no history and don‚Äôt even make sense, and the street thief trope (cue the eyeroll - i‚Äôm probably an outlier on this one, but i just hate how much the street thief trope has been overused. there was no way paedyn would have survived a day on the streets with the amount of stupid shit that she pulled. did no one notice her wonderfully-amazing-most-gorgeous-beautiful-stunning-oh-so-rare-never-seen-before hair colour while she was off pickpocketing the rich? i‚Äôm very sure no one did, seeing as it wasn‚Äôt mentioned on every.other.page.)now it's time for more stupid things.. so many stupid things. so many. and i‚Äôve actually missed a lot so if you can remember anything i‚Äôm missing please let me know <3‚û≥ a trained soldier is dancing in the middle of a deathly arena because he likes a girl -

OH MY GOSH~‚Ä¢~‚Ä¢~That ending hurt. A lot.*deep breath* Okay let\'s get started with the review.I absolutely adored this book.The world created is so mesmerizing. The characters and storyline are so compelling. Both the leads- Paedyn and Kai are lovable. I\'ll be honest, this book is not perfect but I enjoyed it regardless.‚úîÔ∏è Magic system‚úîÔ∏è Forbidden romance‚úîÔ∏è Angsty slow burn‚úîÔ∏è Mutual pining‚úîÔ∏è Knife to the throat‚úîÔ∏è Tending to scars‚úîÔ∏è ""Who did this to you?""‚úîÔ∏è He kills for herThe book imostarts off a tad slowbut it\'s completely understandable as we are getting to know the world, the fantasy elements and the characters. It picks up pace towards the middle and stays consistent.An issue I had with this book and which is why it wasn\'t a perfect read for me is the fact that it reminded me TOO MUCH of The Hunger Games.I appreciate when authors take inspiration from a book and make something new with it but the first half of this book was a bit too much replication. This is not to damper anyone\'s expectations but rather give a realistic approach. I still enjoyed it quite a lot which you can see from my updates but it would have been perfect had this issue not existed.I absolutely LOVED the charactersand the complexities that came with them. Kai and Paedyn were imperfectly perfect. They have so much depth and life to them, it was hard to resist them.Kaiis going straight to my book boyfriends list. The man is capable of making me swoon and feel things by merely saying a few words and they don\'t even have to be romantic. He radiates such energy, charisma, and obviously his powers intrigues me a lot. The way he is so smitten with Pae is everything. For him, she is the only girl in the room. For him, she is his and he\'ll do anything to keep her alive and safe.Paedynis no less. She is fierce, equally charismatic and full of zeal and the woman knows how much power she holds in her flirtations, touches over Kai. Her confidence and the ability to stay strong is so impressive. I loved how she holds her own. She tried so hard to resist the charms of the prince and yet found herself wanting him more and I absolutely loved it.The romance is deliciously angsty and slow burning.I get some people are on the surface cause it\'s YA and don\'t really want to give it a go cause of that but believe me you\'re gonna be missing out on the beauty of these two and their intense chemistry. I didn\'t find myself yearning for spice, everything about these two hit perfectly and I wouldn\'t change a thing about it at all.The side characters,Kittin particular, are deeply complex. I saw him destined to become the king that he did at the end, from the beginning. It didn\'t come as a surprise. I found myself sympathizing with him and Kai more so for Pae. I don\'t mind Kitt becoming someone he wasn\'t meant to be, it\'s going to make things immensely interesting. Jax and A were my other favourites.The ending was predictable imo.I saw it coming ages ago so although I wasn\'t completely shocked, it was still impactful and made me excited to read the next one.Overall, an enjoyable read and one I absolutely love. It has the potential of becoming my favorite series but will see how the next books go üòâ What y\'all waiting for? Give it a read!!Like Powerless? Read these-1. The Hunger Games2.

In the end, it appeared that she desperately attempted to sew and combine multiple clich√©d scenes to force the protagonists to be in a sort of forced proximity. & it simply did not blend well because the final patchwork felt everything but spontaneous.while the intrigue was compelling enough to dive into the book at first, the unclear and blurry world building made it quite boring after a few chapters. I was under the impression that the author would simplify and distill explanations throughout the story. (how many powers there‚Äôs in the wild, for exemple.) but the main question that puzzled the entirety of the book was\'why the trials?\'. i believed it was ancestral, but it wasn\'t. we were not given a concret clarification of why they had to go through them.

It appeared thatKai and Pae were constantly attempting to make the most stereotypical comments. even the king\'s speeches were not as majestic as they should have been.the lack of depth in the characters was the primary reason for my difficulty in going through these 500 pages. why didn\'t the author incorporate any other colors into Pae\'s character other than her still mourning her deceased father? or to Kai to aspire to be more than the future enforcer ? all he does is complain and mop about his obligation to kill people and his brother\'s inability to handle it if the roles where inversed. instead of it being a well depicted enemies to lovers with good character‚Äôs wisdom and portrayal it just wavered into them already thinking about each other in a romantic way. all that because the narrative forced them to spend a lot of time with each other.how do you persuade readers to want to continue a trilogy when they aren\'t that attached to the protagonists in the first place?‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏èspoilersi did not sign for a love triangle.the way pae inlassably brought up her father‚Äôs death and how Kai made strange comments about his first murder seemed like he killed her father not the king.‚Äî‚Äî-here we go..'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'you should know i‚Äôm honest to my core when i tell you that i love the author - i think she is an angel of a human being - but i really did not love her book. tragic considering i went in expecting to enjoy it. one day i will stop getting bamboozled by this exact variety of tiktok hype but that day is apparently not today!!!similar to the hunger games i guess if you are ok with nothing making in-universe sense and the reasoning behind it all being ‚Äúü§∑\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è i dunno, vibes?‚Äù instead of a thoughtful critique of capitalism, commodification, and spectacle.i think i could have gotten past that though (not everything has to be that serious lmfao i am an ali hazelwood fan‚Ä¶i would be throwing stones from a GLASS HOUSE) but the writing was just so over the top and longwinded-but-also-average-fanfiction-vibes in a way that is difficult to capture in a review but that you‚Äôd get right away reading the book. it is this very specific style where the author says something, and then says it again but with other words that start with the same letters, and then the sentence has ~parallelism~ but also it is so obviously baked in that it loses any impact. like: ""she was Bold and Beautiful and Beyond my Bountiful expectations."" but x1000 all throughout the book. i found it pretty hard to get through by the end.with that said - i am but one (1) girl, this is a minority opinion. most people i trust online like this book. i think if the writing style doesn‚Äôt bother you this could be mindlessly fun a la fourth wing. it doesn\'t take itself particularly seriously. the central relationship is very slow burn and has ample yearning/a decent foundation - though it is quite instalove in terms of their individual feelings, NOT legitimate enemies to lovers (they like each other lmao) and the banter (much like the writing) is often over the top. the story has a mountain of cliches - but they are cliches for a reason. sometimes you just want something silly that is full of all of your guilty pleasure tropes. this was not my experience. but it could be yours, and i hope lauren keeps writing!!!'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3 starsit‚Äôs time to be honest.let me start by saying that i didn‚Äôt (and still don‚Äôt) know who lauren is on booktok. sothis review is unbiased as possible. ü´∂üèª(please don‚Äôt forget that a 3 stars isn‚Äôt a bad rating either.)the first half of this book was nearly a copy and paste of the hunger games.while some readers probablywantthat, it took away from originality for me. i could NOT stop comparing for storyline.

Thank youü•∞)‚ùóÔ∏è‚Ä¢It was a Red queen fan fiction.‚Ä¢Zero original ideas.‚Ä¢The last 40 pages were the only interesting and unique plot from the author.‚Ä¢Long boring (bad structured) paragraphs‚Ä¢Wattpad diologue.‚Ä¢Lazy writing.‚Ä¢The Characters reactions made no sense.‚Ä¢Enemies to lovers? More like: forced and lazy interactions to enemies (ig)‚Ä¢Quotes that felt repetitive or were directly written many times in the same page or chapter.‚öîÔ∏è ‚ÄúInspired by Red queen and The hunger games‚Äù = excuse to not say she copied everything about those two series and changed some aspects or characters in the most lazy way. Example:The cream that cures Katniss and it‚Äôs sent from Haymitch is changed into: Kai finding a remedy to cure Paedyn because it might‚Äôve fallen from another person‚Äôs pocket. LIKE WHAT?‚öîÔ∏èEverything about the trials was boring and didn‚Äôt make any sense. When it first started I was like: Finally! 200 pages of nothing, maybe it gets better and then boom IT NEVER DID.‚öîÔ∏èPaedyn and Kitt had more chemistry than Paedyn and Kai (it felt so forced). They were ALWAYS finding each other (also another way to never develop the other characters that had a lot of potential since they all had different and interesting powers). The ‚ÄúI hate you‚Äù but I have no idea why was SO HARD IN THIS BOOK.‚öîÔ∏èWhen I got to Kai‚Äôs POV, he was always saying that she wanted to be enemies but in reality they were always flirting and touching each other because they have to have ‚Äúquemistry‚Äù but apparently you also have to force an enemies to lovers trope because what is revealed at the end has to make sense but it never does. It‚Äôs very clear that there is NO reason for you to hate Kai because of his ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù and the fact that he remains you of his father. Which also leads me to talk about the king and queen:‚öîÔ∏èTHE QUEEN was never there, she loved Kai but never did anything for him. Why? We are given a poor excuse that that was correct for him and he was always destined to become the enforcer and suffer.‚öîÔ∏èTHE KING and his personality that didn‚Äôt make sense, bother me SO MUCH and let‚Äôs not talk about his poor dialogues. He was the reason of all the tragedies and traumas but he was even sharing dinner in the same table with everyone!!!üòÅYou can do that, yes! My problem is that he doesn‚Äôt have a well developed personality leading his character to become ridiculous in the eyes of the reader.‚öîÔ∏èAnd I say instead of forcing Kai and Paedyn to find each other ALL THE TIME use all those pages to make her interact with the other characters like Lenny: cuz wdym he calls you princess and likes you out of nowhere (remember if you‚Äôre writing a book you are telling the story to the readers not to you! So even if it looks ‚Äúobvious‚Äù you have to develop that relationship and write it directly)‚öîÔ∏èAlso, let‚Äôs not talk about the amount of ridiculous nicknamesüôÑüôÑüôÑ‚öîÔ∏èAdena was there at the beginning and at the end, leaving me like: ok you love her so much but she‚Äôs barely mentioned throughout the book.‚öîÔ∏èThe father taught her how to fight and he was a healer üíÄThe characters had NO personality, only plain mid and typical backstories.‚öîÔ∏èIf you haven‚Äôt read Red Queen then you probably are not going to understand why I said this book is a Red Queen fan fiction:‚Ä¢Adena: Mare‚Äôs sister. They both design clothes.‚Ä¢Kai: Cal but with a flirting personality (oh but let‚Äôs not forget that we have to force him into a dark ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt share my feelings cuz I‚Äôm a monster‚Äù character.) Also, what‚Äôs with Paedyn describing him as a cocky bastard and two pages latter saying that he was this mysterious guy üßçüèª\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è.‚Ä¢Kitt: Naive prince who‚Äôs clearly becoming the villain at the end: Maven.‚öîÔ∏èAnd I could go on and on but honestly it bores me to tears to remember all of the characters because that‚Äôs what the story was: plain and boring(unnecessarily long).‚öîÔ∏èLike I said: a Fan fiction (dare I say that Red queen was at least more unique) and it felt as if the author wrote this and never check it before publishing it. It was like: hereü§≤üèª theres this book that feels incredibly overwhelming and it has a lot of tropes that are a favorite on booktok but I didn‚Äôt develop them well.‚öîÔ∏èI‚Äôve said this before and I‚Äôm gonna say it again: There is one book on Wattpad that includes royals and everything and it was 100% better than this ‚Äúbook‚Äù. So if you read books in Spanish you should definitely give it a try!!! It‚Äôs called EL PERFUME DEL REY. (And yes I read this recently so there is no: I read this in 2015 you‚Äôll probably not like it now) The book is also in a physical copy!!! And has illustrationsüòç‚öîÔ∏èPeople recommend this saying that is very cheesy and it‚Äôs for a younger audience, when in reality there are BETTER books with VERY YA scenes like: Once upon a broken heart that were actually good (I‚Äôm 18)‚öîÔ∏èAnyway. I say, read this if you want to but I still think it‚Äôs not fair that you have to pay 20$ for something that copied basically everything from other popular books and everyone on booktok is hyping it knowing damn well this has a poor plot and it should be on Wattpad.‚öîÔ∏èIm gonna say this a last time: I paid for this book and I feel like at least I deserve to give my opinion on it and WHY I didn‚Äôt like it.I gave it 1‚≠êÔ∏è because Ik there could be more improvement and it‚Äôs also very impressive that somebody wrote 500 pages at 18!'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""What in The-Hunger-Games-Divergent-Serpent-and-the-Wings-of-Night-Throne-of-Glass-Young-Elites-Shatter-Me fandom mash-up is this?Disclaimer:I know nothing of the author and don‚Äôt keep up with BookTok books, so this review is unbiased in every possible way. Even in moments where I may diss the book, I have absolutely nothing against the author and am open to reading her future releases.That being said, I have lost faith in humanity.I truly do not understand the hype for this. At all. There are so many other, better written fantasy romance novels out there.It wasn‚Äôt just that this was unoriginal and bad writing, but the romance was awful, the characters bland, the plot pacing so damn slow with so many pointless scenes, and every plot aspect was absolutely RIDDLED with logistic issues. If you take the time to look at things for half a second, the whole thing falls apart irrevocably.This whole thing hinges upon tropes and other peoples‚Äô nostalgia and love for to all the books I just listed above.People are actually recommending this to fans of The Hunger Games.For the love of God, if you are a true fan of The Hunger Games, DO. NOT. pick this up.This is SO bad that to compare it to that is to make a mockery of the franchise.The concept of The Hunger Games has a sick sort of logic to it that makes sense.This, whatever trials were in Powerless, did not make sense.So the whole conflict in this world is that the king basically kills all the powerless, called Ordinaries, and the Fatals, which are the those who have powers so strong they are a threat to everyone, Ordinary or Elite. He does this to keep the Elites strong and him in power, believing that reproducing with Ordinaries will deplete the Elite‚Äôs power overtime.Okay. Fine. But then why would you host the Purging Trials where many of your treasured elites might die?? Not only that, but to contradict again, it‚Äôs literally said multiple times that the trials are meant to showcase powers, not to kill other contestants. But with a name like the PURGING trials, what else do you think the contestests are going to do? Come on. Also, most of the contestants are literally childhood friends or acquaintances, and you‚Äôre telling me they‚Äôre nonchalantly killing them off, when it‚Äôs not even required to win the trials? I‚Äôm sorry, but I‚Äôm not rooting for or sympathizing with ANY of these sadistic characters. This isn‚Äôt morally grey, this is pure evil.Building upon the issues I‚Äôve already brought up and my many questions that remain unanswered, the novel is a mess of plot holes.I‚Äôm sure most of this is due to the fact that the plot was not born from an idea‚Äîwhether it be world, character, or plot based. It‚Äôs built from a trope, which is never a solid foundation for a book.I am so tired of this new trend of trope-dumping. Sure, tropes are nice, even amazing, in extreme moderation. And even then, thetropes should not be the driving force in a novel or even in plot progression.These are like literary devices, used to elicit a certain atmosphere or feeling, whether in the story or readers. Tropes do not a plot make. They are not a substitute, they are not character building, they are not even effective romance development techniques. So please, for all of our sake, let's move on!There are many more plot holes, but at this point my frustration over it all, while writing this, is becoming unhealthy so I‚Äôll just stop while I‚Äôm ahead.There is nothing of substance to the characters.Nothing to differentiate them from one another and nothing to make them anything but the basic stereotypes of whatever role they‚Äôre intended to fulfill.Prince Kai is the worst of them all. He‚Äôs supposed to be some badass, monstrous assassin for the king. But nothing ever backs up these claims. In fact, Roberts goes so overboard on his charming nature (which is more cringeworthy than actually charming) and his romantic feelings for the FMC that he‚Äôs honestly softer than every other character in the novel. Result the exact opposite of the intention, I‚Äôm sure.Paedyn has the most pick-me energy that I‚Äôve had the displeasure of reading in recent memory. She screams Wattpad fanfic on the basis of she has no flaws, her only weakness being her supposed love for others and her unparalleled heroism.The dialogue between characters is the worst.I could not keep my face straight when I read it; the secondhand embarrassment was worse than the experience of watching DUFF or Awkward. (Y‚Äôall know what I‚Äôm talking about, I know you do).The romance is terrible. I tried to think of a better way to put it, but I could not without altering the truth of the matter.Why, why, why do we follow this ridiculous love triangle between Paedyn and the two royal brothers, Kai and Kitt? For one, this screams heavily influenced by Red Queen. For another, the novel is literally a fantasy romance told from the perspectives of Paedyn and Kai. We know it‚Äôll be their romance in the end, because Kitt‚Äôs POV is not included. So why waste our time? It literally adds nothing to the story.Onto the actual romance at the forefront of the novel, this is as insta-love as it can possibly get, folks. Sometimes, insta-love is called for, most of the time it‚Äôs not. Have I ever liked it either way? Absolutely the fuck not, there‚Äôs the door.üö™Kai and Paedyn have no chemistry. How could they when they‚Äôre lusting over one another from the moment they lay eyes on each other? Their romance goes from 0-100 REAL QUICK, and I‚Äôm talking 30% of the way in. Then, as if the author remembers that, actually, we need to slip the ‚Äúslow burn‚Äù trope in, she decides the characters need to blatantly fawn over one another for damn near the rest of the book but do nothing about it. Literally, what is the purpose? The slow burn doesn‚Äôt hit the same if you‚Äôve already solidified the romance in the first 100 pages.Anyway, I did not like this. Pick up some Carissa Broadbent instead, okay folks?""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'This was not good. As a trending booktok book, I didn‚Äôt really know what I was getting into because those are always a bit of a toss up, but it was still one of my most anticipated releases.The main issue with Powerless is that it was written FOR social media. It was written around popular tropes even if putting in those tropes was completely out of place and forced. Now listen, I‚Äôm not against using popular tropes or anything, but they‚Äôre only effective if they come naturally and actually have a reason to be there. It felt completely unoriginal because I had read it all before.And it wasn‚Äôt just the tropes that made this book so unoriginal. I swear that this was just a carbon copy of The Hunger Games x Red Queen. The characters were all 2D versions of characters from the Hunger Game, the world building was literally the exact same as in Red Queen except if the Red Queen Universe hosted an annual Hunger Games, and the plot was just a bunch of copy and pasted moments from both. I understand that with fantasy books you‚Äôre always going to see some parallels between books, but this was insane. It was so so bad. Every page was deja vu and not in a good way. As someone who loved the Hunger Games (not Red Queen as much but I can respect it), some of this honestly felt a little disrespectful because it was so similar yet there was no meaningfulness or relevance to everything. THG is a commentary on our modern-day capitalist society and so many of the scenes and premises that were blatantly copied in this book actually held incredible importance in THG but were just thrown in with no meaning or thought whatsoever here.Then there was the romance, the reason we‚Äôre all here. I feel kind of 50/50 on this because Kai and Paedyn did have some ‚Äúchef‚Äôs kiss‚Äù moments, but the tension was so overdone. When you put in so much sexual tension, there comes a point where it‚Äôs no longer tense. I also hated how Kai was always calling Pae ‚Äúdarling,‚Äù not because I hate that name or anything, but because it was used all the time and felt really forced. I also don‚Äôt understand all the nose flicking. Why was Kai always flicking Paedyn‚Äôs nose for no apparent reason. That will never not be weird. Nonetheless, it was one of the book‚Äôs better aspects which is great because it is, in fact, romantasy.The writing also wasn‚Äôt too bad, especially considering that this is a debut novel. However, the use of the term ‚Äúocean eyes‚Äù was literally criminal and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to listen to that song again (iykyk). Oh, and ‚Äúcocky bastard‚Äù too. We can do better than that.The world building, like I said before, was completely unoriginal, but it also made about 0 sense. I mean, the whole idea behind the Purging Trials is so that the kingdom can showcase the power of the elites, but the whole thing was so flimsy. Like, you‚Äôre going to have a bunch of people with powers go fight each other (and kill each other, although it was never explained if that was the actual goal or what) and film them for‚Ä¶ entertainment purposes? Don‚Äôt even get me started on the whole history with the Elites and Ordinaries with the Plague and everything. So many plot holes in this regard.I will say that this book was very entertaining and bingeable. Despite the fact that I kind of hated it, it still would be one of my go-to‚Äôs for a reading marathon or a long trip or something like that.In the end, this was a huge letdown for me. It really is an interesting example of how social media is effecting the book industry and, while I think there are some good things that come out of this, I really have a lot of issues with it. Honestly, Powerless was so formulaic that it almost felt like it was generated by AI (I know it wasn‚Äôt- I‚Äôve been following Lauren Roberts on social media for a while and I‚Äôve seen what she‚Äôs put into this book). I know the that a lot of people love this book but it wasn‚Äôt for me. 2 stars.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm never sober around you, Pae.

Sometimes it can be at the very end of the book where the two characters kiss and it\'s just hard to wait that longi‚Äôm kind of impatient when it comes to romance üôâBUT‚Ä¶. this book kind of changed my perspective a little bit. To say I really liked this is an understatement. It‚Äôs such a beautiful, playful and humorous book. The plot the characters especially the characters specifically the female character, PAE!!! She is such a inspiration to all people especially girls!! I just love the way she carried herself and just went through the competition with such grace, passion, and determination. This book also reminded me a lot of my favorite dark romance series Blood and Ash series. The threats of how stabbing turns people on is just giving Casteel from blood and ash and it was like living deja vu all over again. But yeah this book had a little something of everything and I loved it sm!! I will say as someone who isn\'t really a slowburn fan I‚Äôm thinking about reconsidering after reading this. üíó Infinity x Infinity stars all around!!!‚öîMain Characters‚öî‚òòPae‚òòThis girl is my heart and soul!! I love her sm!! She is such a powerful female character. I love how she doesn‚Äôt try to just fit in with the other girls. Every chance she got she spoke up and expressed her feelings. And even when she wasn‚Äôt trying to she was so funny. Her relationship with Kai is just so cute and so romantic. Ik they didn‚Äôt really get a good kiss but Ik they‚Äôre is definitely something special for them in the cards. I really hope that she is still able to continue to being herself no matter what even after what happened. Usually its rare to get this much female agency throughout a whole book let alone a series so I‚Äôm hoping that she is able to just be true to herself and keep fighting for her relationship with Kai no matter what. Also can we just talk about the dresses she wore with the high slit and the dagger on her thigh and didn\'t even bat an eye at the traditional dresses that everyone had to wear that was all the same color. I‚Äôm talking badass girl right there!! üéÄüíòüíñ‚òòKai‚òòKai is literally the book guy everyone wants. üòçHe is so funny and smart. He cares sm eventho he doesn‚Äôt seem like he does at first. He literally spared people when he was supposed to kill them And ofc he is absolutely so handsome. Like I was giggling and kicking my feet he was just so cute and so entertaining to read about. And the way he always put caring for Pae over his other duties was just so thoughtful and he is literally on of the best mmc in like book history. And I loved when he was so attentive to Pae and always found some way to crack a joke while flirting was just so swoonworthy. üòã Like idk how I‚Äôm going to survive while Reckless isn‚Äôt here yet. And there was one scene I loved sm when they were talking about feelings and she was trying to put her walls up and he like next time don‚Äôt tap your left foot and lie to me. Like somehow he just knew.‚öîSide Characters‚öîThe were all pretty decent the best friend was my favorite.

IYKYK, my reviews are always honest.Writing: idk out of 5 | Plot: ????2???/5 | Ending: 5/5 tbhAfter letting this marinate for a couple of hours, 2 stars is the way to go.THE PLOTMillie is living in Casa Nissan aka her car when she\'s hired as the maid for the Winchesters, a ridiculously wealthy family. She\'s over the moon to have a job and a bed, but she quickly realizes something funky is happening in the home. And she\'s not sure if she\'ll make it out alive... dun dun dunnnnnn!!!!!MY OPINIONHonestly... I\'m confusion. This is how I felt after I readThe Trapped Wifeby Samantha Hayes. On one hand, this was garbagio, on the other hand, it had some things that kept me reading and enjoying myself. It\'s a book I love to hate and hate to love all at once. Ok, let me try to make sense of thoughts:- Millie\'s POV is straight up ""dear diary"" style. As in, ""I spent 7 hours cleaning the house and I thought about Andy Winchester\'s bangin bod the entire time. He is so dreamy. Does he like me too????"" It\'s also giving me ""rages to riches"" fanfic written by a tween vibes. BUT AT THE SAME DAMN TIME... the book was legit funny in parts???? Like great dark humour throughout????- Millie\'s character makes no sense. Not a spoiler‚Äîshe spends 10 years in jail. Yet she has zero survival skills and seems relatively unbothered by the fact she was locked up for an entire decade. I\'m telling you right now I can\'t last 10 MINUTES in jail unscathed, so a whole ass decade would have me coming out on some Rambo shit.- I did not like Nina. She was over the top, selfish, and illogical. I can\'t feel sorry for what she went through because .... No spoilers.... but if you read it, you\'ll know.- The ""mystery"" is kinda obvious. It\'s likeThe Wife Between Usmixed with... idk,Gone Girl? There wasn\'t really any suspense. You know what\'s gonna happen. From Part II onward I was speed reading like a mf. But I was invested in the whole revenge vibe like ok girl go OFFFFFF.- I gave the ending 5/5 because it\'s women\'s history month and that\'s all I can say without spoiling it- I\'ve readThe Locked Doorby this author and this was a totally different vibe. Good for her for going in a totally different direction with no projection of her medical career/knowledge in the story. I\'m not sure if it worked, but at least the ending was better than Locked Door.I can see people really enjoying this or really hating it. Do not expect this to be a literary masterpiece. You will not be mentally stimulated in any way. This is your standard popcorn thriller but not as annoying as Unmissing, Stay Awake, etc because of the dark humour. This is the type of book you read afterMy Dark Vanessarips your heart out and stomps all over it.PROS AND CONSPros: you\'ll keep reading because you don\'t know if you like it or hate it, awesome dark humour, great endingCons: vapid plot and characters, rags to riches fanfic written by a 14 yo vibes, dear diary ass writing'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '‚ÄúThe Housemaid‚Äù by Freida McFadden is just one of those novels that for years to come, I will speak highly of and recommend to anyone that wants an incredible thriller. One that‚Äôs also filled with mystery and psychological terror all wrapped together brilliantly. From McFadden‚Äôs excellent writing style to all the characters I absolutely loved, this is easily one of the best novels of 2022.It‚Äôs a very addictive read that is so hard to put down, you‚Äôll more than likely find yourself reading deep into the night because it‚Äôs a genuine page-turner. I loved all the little revelations that pop up here and there on top of an incredible story. Just when you think you have it figured out, this novel turns your world upside down.Don‚Äôt worry, I will not go into any specifics or spoil anything for you but I‚Äôd consider this a must-read novel. Besides the fantastic pacing, I also loved all the New York references since I‚Äôm a New Yorker and it really felt close to home. Thinking back on everything, I can‚Äôt tell you how many authentic jaw-dropping moments I had while reading this as this novel completely blew my mind.The ending was beyond satisfying and just something I didn‚Äôt expect at all! LoL saying it was a drop-the-mic moment is an understatement. This was a wild, insane, fun, adrenaline-filledthriller that kept me on the edge of my seat. It was a wonderful reading experience as I wish every novel I read was like this!I give ‚ÄúThe Housemaid‚Äù by Freida McFadden a perfect 5/5 as this is a masterpiece. I‚Äôve read many novels in my life and this is one of the most memorable ones that will forever stand out for me. This novel was unique, exciting, and everything you could ever want in a thriller and then some. It‚Äôs a rollercoaster of a read from start to finish and I can honestly say that McFadden has a new reader in me. This was the first novel I‚Äôve read by her and I‚Äôm genuinely excited to read more of her work and whatever future novels she writes. She is an amazing author with one incredibly creative and talented mind!'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '3.5 stars ‚Äî I decided to read another Freida McFadden book because I wanted a page turner that didn‚Äôt require much thinking. ‚ÄúThe Housemaid‚Äù had gotten numerous high reviews so I decided to try it. The book started off very good and had me hooked from the beginning. It tells the story of Millie a recent parolee who is homeless and in need of a job. When she gets hired by Nina and Andrew as a live-in housemaid/nanny she believes she has found her dream job. But soon she realizes that Nina is a very difficult person to work for (think Meryl Streep in ‚ÄúThe Devil Wears Prada‚Äù). I really enjoyed the interactions between Millie and Nina and her family. I was squarely in the 4.5 to 5 stars range up until the final 30 pages or so of the book. I won‚Äôt spoil it but to say the actions of the police, Enzo, Millie and Nina were ridiculous is such an understatement of how bad this book came to a close I can‚Äôt describe it. I don‚Äôt remember yelling out ‚ÄúNo‚Äù and ‚Äúcome on‚Äù and ‚Äúreally‚Äù while reading a book before. (Yes I‚Äôm weird) but I had no choice considering the epic plot collapse that left me shaking my head. Even with a full 1 star reduction I enjoyed the book and will have to read the sequel to see if McFadden can return to the form that had me on the edge of my seat for the first 90 percent of the book.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'This book is not as clever as it thinks it is.Everyone is trying to gaslight everyone else and it‚Äôs messy.We know next to nothing about Millie for at least 60% of the novel‚Ä¶so why are we supposed to care about her?Millie could make more of an effort with Enzo. Italian to English is right there on your damn phone.Nina‚Äôs chapters are bizarre.I‚Äôm still not sure what the ‚Äúbig‚Äù twist is. There are several reveals, but nothing earth-shattering.This tries to be an upscale version of Minka Kent...or a low-budget version of Sarah Pinborough. But the characters are so thinly developed that the author leaves everything to hinge on plot‚Äîa dubious choice, at best.You probably won‚Äôt want to put it down. But you will be asking yourself what the hell you just read.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""The plot twist in this book got me good!! I never ever saw it comingü§Ø. I love how this book started out so creepy and eerie, with Nina behaving so weirdly, and then really escalated in the second half to full-on dangerous. I also love how Millie is so mysterious. We don't know much about her for a huge chunk of the book. It was fun to slowly unravel more of her back story. The only downside to that, though, is that it did take me a little bit to care about Millie because we didn't know a lot about her in the beginning.Overall 4 stars!

After all the buzzing hype surrounding this book that never seems to diminish, I finally decided it was time to dive in and award myself some entertaining popcorn reading. However, oh boy, this book absolutely deserves every bit of its never-ending hype. It exceeded my expectations, had me gritting my teeth, squirming restlessly in my seat, and, even though I anticipated the delicious twist from the beginning, I still admired how the author perfectly developed this smart cat-and-mouse game. The last third, in particular, was exceptionally brilliant! I knew right from the beginning that I would enjoy this heart-throbbing, jaw-dropping, unputdownable, twisty psychological thriller, but I didn't expect to love it even more and immediately decided to jump into the next book of the series, despite some reviews emphasizing that it might not be as good as the first one. I just couldn't resist spending more time in Millie the maid's disturbing, mind-bending world!Meet Millie: recently released from prison for a crime we don't know if she committed or what kind of crime she got involved in. She's homeless, living in her Nissan, worn down from her latest job at the bar, getting rejected even from burger joints, barely having a chance to start over at her young age (she's in her mid-twenties, a pretty girl, but she disguises her beauty behind glasses and baggy clothes, just in case somebody thinks she's too attractive to be hired). She can't believe her luck when her application as a housemaid at Winchester House (correction: it's a mansion surrounded by a gate with a beautiful landscape) is approved by Nina Winchester: a stay-at-home wife, a bit overweight, dressed only in white, a sophisticated woman who seems friendly at first sight.Millie is introduced to Nina's little girl, who looks like she jumped out of a Children of the Corn movie with her weird baby doll dress, white-blond hair, and spoiled brat attitude that rubs her the wrong way. Then there's the father, the breadwinner of the family, the overly handsome Andrew Winchester, who seems like Prince Charming and whom Millie can barely stop herself from drooling over.Millie doesn't mind that she has to live in the attic, with a room that has the tiniest window that never opens and a lock outside the door that mostly gets stuck. She also keeps herself in check as Nina's emotionally unstable behavior pushes her buttons until they nearly fall to the floor. She can't flip the bird to her unsatisfied, bickering, witchy employer and her irritating, annoying little daughter because if she doesn't get a good reference from her employer, she's forced to live in her car, violating her parole, which could send her back to prison. She keeps her mouth shut, but it's not easy to deal with Nina's mood swings.When she learns a dirty little secret about Nina's past and gets warned by the hot, candy-like landscaper Enzo, who unfortunately speaks only Italian, she realizes that by accepting this job, she may be putting her life in danger. Especially when it's so tempting to get seduced by Mr. Winchester, while his wife watches them like a jealous hawk, ready to tear her limbs apart. Oh, Millie, you've found yourself in another prison you can't escape, haven't you?Overall, I'm giving this highly earned five stars and diving into the next novel of Millie the Maid as fast as possible! This story has truly captivated me, and I can't wait to see where Millie's adventures take her next.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5/5 ‚òÖ‚Äôs‚ÅÄ‚û∑‚ùùyou‚Ä¶pericolo.‚ùûdanger.¬∞‚ùÄ‚ãÜ.‡≥É‡øî*:ÔΩ•ùìºùìπùì∏ùì≤ùìµùìÆùìª ùìØùìªùìÆùìÆ ùìªùìÆùìøùì≤ùìÆùîÄthis was my first freida book and it has me feeling like i need to take a trip to the nearest psych ward. i finished this book inSIXhours.more like four because i spent two of those hours spam texting shei throughout the entire booküôàshe pulled an all-nighter for meü•πü´Çplease go into my review with very low expectations because since it‚Äôs spoiler free‚Ä¶i won‚Äôt be able to say a lotü•∫‚ù• ùìÇùìé ùìâùíΩùëúùìäùëîùíΩùìâùìà:i‚Äôm convinced this entire book is laced with crack. whatever kind of drug that makes you completely lose your mind‚Ä¶this book is also laced with thatüòÄfrom start to finish i was absolutely addicted. i couldn‚Äôt put it down. i was worried that i was going to dislike this book simply because it‚Äôs been awhile since i‚Äôve read anything other than romance, but i absolutely loved it. speaking of romance‚Ä¶if you are a romance addict, ihighly recommendthis book to you. i‚Äôm gigglingü§≠i wanted a good mind fuck and freida really said: bitch, you‚Äôre going to get more than just a mind fuck. this story was so terrifying that it gave me nightmaresüòÄthanks freidaüíãthat was some twisted ass shit frü•≤‚ù• ùìÖùìÅùëúùìâ:the plot was plotting. plotting against me. i am a victim. freida, bae, quick question.how could you?the plot twists‚Ä¶my jaw was on the floor and i still haven‚Äôt picked it up yet. this book had me thinking i had everything figured out one minute and then completely confused the next. i always had it in the back of my mind of what could‚Äôve possibly happened, but when shit happened‚Ä¶idk what i expected, but let me just tell you that it wasn‚Äôt THAT. almost had me sprinting to the bathroom to throw up! i won‚Äôt say much more because i encourage everyone to go into this book blindly! it‚Äôll give you the best experience <3‚ù• ùìåùìáùíæùìâùíæùìÉùëî:bone chilling. i would not survive a single minute in freida‚Äôs mind, but i‚Äôd still pay to live a day in there anyways. she‚Äôs an absolute genius. at one point i was like: is this a romance or a mystery/thriller?

Almost like he\'s trying to warn me.""And then he tells her it\'s dangerous and she should leave. Huh, I wonder why the gardener would tell a random woman she\'s in danger living in this rich suburban home as the maid. What could possibly go wrong?3. Millie meets the husband and immediately notices how hot he is.""It\'s hard not to notice that he is several levels more attractive than his wife.""And throughout the story she constantly comments on how handsome he is. I wonder what\'s going to happen between the super hot maid and her super hot employer. . .4. Millie\'s bedroom door locks from the outside and she notices there are scratches on the door,""Like somebody was scraping at the door. Trying to get out.""Cue the Cardi-B viral sound ""That\'s suspicious. That\'s weird."" We all know she\'s getting locked in that room at some point.There\'s a lot more but again, I don\'t want to spend more time on this book so, moving on to my next point.The writing was juvenile.Along with the author\'s penchant for pandering to the reader, the book was just so average written. It felt like someone in high school wrote it. Simple writing. Basic characters. Unrealistic development.Millie was an unbearable FMC.She\'s a recently released convict and has had a hard time keeping a job. She\'s desperate, which is why she overlooks all the red flags about this new job as a maid. But for fuck\'s sake, it\'s like she has zero self preservation. I absolutely hated her and the choices she made throughout the story. The only redeeming thing about her was how she handles everything at the end.But that ending has me laughing because of the sheer stupidity of it all.You\'re telling me Millie has been a dud for the entire book but somehow she comes out on top at the end? I don\'t believe it but whatever.Overall, this book was a miss and I do not recommend it. I should be giving this 1 stars because I legit didn‚Äôt like anything about it. But it was readable and even if predictable, there was a cohesive plot. . . so I‚Äôll give it 1.5 stars.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Thank you to the publisher and NetGalley for providing me with a copy of this novel for an honest review. It has been published in April 2022.""The Housemaid"" by Freida McFadden was a bit of a disappointment to read.First of all, the tagline ""From behind closed doors, she sees everything"" must have been chosen by someone who never read the book, because it couldn\'t be farther from the truth: Millie goes through the novel blissfully unaware of everything that happens around her, be it behind closed doors or not. Even the most telegraphed plot twists somehow catch her by surprise, despite all the warning signs and the not-so-cryptic warnings she receives from other characters. The only ones who see everything from behind closed doors areAndrew and Enzo, and how sad it is thata novel written by a woman, with a woman as a protagonist, should depict both its female main characters as such hapless damsels in distress?Nina has no agency at all, she\'s only good to be rescued by her super-hot, muscled, Italian stud, and even Millie shows no initiative at all up until the very ending.On the good side, the narrative flows easily enough, making the read a quick one. On the not so good side, there are some huge plotholes that make the whole novel feel like a joke: for starters,Enzo\'s charade doesn\'t hold water. It\'s simply not believable that a man in his thirties who has lived and worked in the US for 3 years, being employed by a dozen families in such a posh neighbourhood, and who is considered the best at what he does, would not speak any English at all, not even the most basic communication that Italian children are taught in primary school. When we find out that he\'s just pretending, it\'s even worse! How would he ever get a job with all those very wealthy, very elitist families if he wasn\'t able to let on that he spoke the language? How would he be able to follow his customer\'s instructions, to the point that he\'s considered ""the best at his job"", if he had to pretend he didn\'t understand them at all?And what about the ""translating apps"" that Millie mentions in the very beginning of the book, hoping that they\'ll help her communicate with Enzo, except then she never uses them, never mentions them again and spends the rest of the novel complaining that she has no way of communicating with Enzo?What about the security guard who searches Millie on the basis of a random phonecall tipping him off about her alleged shoplifting? In the real world, no security guard in their right mind would do such a thing: they would more likely enquire who the person calling them is, and how can they know who is a shoplifter and describe how the shoplifter is dressed, since they\'re calling *from outside the shop*.How can Millie describe her new, tiny attic room in the Winchester house as an ""inhuman place, like a torture chamber"", when she\'s been living in the back of her car right before moving to said attic room, and has spent 10 years in jail right before that?Let\'s not even mention how far-fetched the twist aboutthe policeman\'s daughteris, and how it would be absolutely impossible to simplydrop an investigation like that, even if a random policeman decided to.Still, I wouldn\'t have minded the plotholes so much if the characterisation hadn\'t been so bad: literally all of the characters, including the protagonist, are nothing more than stock characters, flat, cartoonish figurines in no way relatable or interesting. On top of that, all 4 main characters (I\'m counting the 9-year-old brat as well, yes) are completely, irredeemably despicable. The only vaguely likeable character is Enzo, but then he\'s a walking stereotype, so in the end I didn\'t like him either.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'what in the batshit crazy, psycho, disturbing verity by colleen hoover was thatgive me more'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""It was a quick fun read, exactly what I needed.

I think I have only read 6 with 4 of them being Holly Jackson's books but that's pretty much it, and I remembered how quickly I read them and how much I enjoyed some of them so I decided that I was going to read a lot of thrillers when I got free in June and The housemaid was the first target and it's safe to say, I loved it. The way this was so fast paced and it had me hooked!! I would've read it in one sitting but because of Eid and having so many guests over and with my cousins coming to stay with us, it made it hard for me to binge read this but I still read a huge portion of it whenever I picked it up, I was literally forced to keep it down. I stand by what I said, thrillers are the hardest to write because it's a mess at the start, there are so many leads and only one culprit and the way you have to tie all of them together while keeping the reader hooked is a really hard job which Freida nailed ü§≠ this book also gave me verity vibes and I was here for it.The story follows our main character Millie who's an ex-convict, desperate for a job.

I would say Millie in this book was a badass, especially with how everything was done in the end üò≠ü§åüèª wow just wow. I really liked her. I won't talk about Nina and Andrew because they are heavily tied to the plot and plot twists and well....I mean I guessed the main twist but not the intensity of it but some of you may not so I won't say anything except for how conflicting and interesting characters they were to read and üëÄ Enzo üëÄ can we get more scenes of him??In thrillers the one thing I learned was that it's never the first person who the MC thinks of as the culprit so my doubts were on someone else and I had predicted that it would be them but didn't know why or how and man üíÄ that was fucked up, the intensity of what they did skyrocketed it really helped me feel for our victim.I also liked how well it was partitioned into three parts and how one followed mille then Nina and then both.Overall, I think that all that I can talk about without spoiling anything but I would definitely recommend it because I had an amazing time.____This is Freida McFadden's highest rated book.......let's see what the hype is all about ü§≠(Let the June thriller tbr marathon begin!)""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '‚òÖ4 stars‚Äú""I can‚Äôt seem to shake that uneasy feeling.

This book is filled with plot twists and when you think you have it figured out, there\'s further reveals. It kept me on edge and while I did suspect some things earlier on, there was definitely a lot of build up towards the end that I didn\'t see coming üëÄ The few twists I did guess didn\'t take away from my enjoyment of the book. This was my first Freida McFadden book and won\'t be my last.I found the writing style to be quite simple and the chapters were relatively short which made this book binge-worthy.The Housemaidis perfect if you are new to the thriller genre or picking one up after a long time. The few issues I had in the first 30% which kept my rating from being higher was that I felt the author was trying too hard to tell me how to feel as the hints and \'thriller elements\' weren\'t subtle. I also found the last couple of chapters to be a little rushed. I wanted to have chills but I sadly didn\'t feel that way but I was definitely hooked on this book.Overall, I thought the epilogue was fantastic and I can\'t wait to see what happens in books 2 and 3. This book is very entertaining and will whisk you away into the thick of it. There are some slight romance elements as well which might entice you to pick this up if you are new to thrillers.

I read Ali Hazelwood for the vibes and obsessed heroes, and that\'s exactly what I got, so I\'m satisfied. Satisfied to the point that this book may have become my favorite Ali book. I never thought a book with an arranged marriage between an alpha werewolf and a vampire would become one, but here we are. I guess that\'s what happens when you grow up with Wattpad.Listen. Is Ali the best author with the most gorgeous writing style? No. Does she write almost the same male characters, but with different hairstyles and workplaces? Yes. But does it matter to me? No. Her stories always absorb me from the very beginning to the end to the point where I completely forget about reality, so I simply love them despite their many imperfections. You could look me straight in the eye and tell me that these books are cringe, stupid, predictable and that I can probably find better stories on Wattpad, and I would completely agree, but I would still simply read them, as they just have that something that works for me.But, let‚Äôs move on to the point. My thoughts. Some spoilers also start here.oneIf you were expecting another short heroine and a hero who would be twice her size, you will be disappointed. We finally have a tall couple.\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200etwoI really liked our heroine Misery. Yes, Ali did her dirty with that name and some of her fashion choices ‚Äî the galaxy t-shirt, but it doesn\'t change the fact that I enjoyed her character. She definitely won\'t be added to my \'favorite heroines\' folder, but compared to really dumb heroines, she wasn\'t bad.threeThe hero, despite the situation at the end when I wanted to strangle him, yes, I\'m talking about the scene in chapter twenty-five when he left her, claiming that ""it was a mistake"" and ""she shouldn\'t be tied to someone like him"", still stole my heart. I know he wanted her to finally have free will and be able to choose what she wanted in her life, but he could have approached it differently.Still, as I said, I loved him. How could I not love the possessive architect Alpha Werewolf who has an amazing way with children, who would do anything for you and his people, who would draw you, who would remind you that consent is the hottest thing in the world and with whose side you would finally find your family and your place in the world. Yes, I know the part about ""architect Alpha Werewolf"" sounds stupid and like something straight out of a bad Wattpad fanfiction, but I don\'t care.‚ÄúI would take anything she chose to give me‚Äîthe tiniest fraction or her entire world. I would take her for a single night knowing that I‚Äôll lose her by morning, and I would hold on to her and never let go. I would take her healthy, or sick, or tired, or angry, or strong, and it would be my fucking privilege. I would take her problems, her gifts, her moods, her passions, her jokes, her body‚ÄîI would take every last thing, if she chose to give it to me.‚ÄùfourThe romance was in typical Ali Hazelwood style, meaning a hero who is almost in love with the heroine from the beginning, but for some reason doesn\'t want to admit it, and a heroine who can\'t pick up any hint about it even though it\'s quite obvious. However, this does not change the fact that I ate it up. The smut too, if you know me, you don\'t, but it was kind of hot.fiveThe plot was pretty interesting to me in the beginning, but it lost me towards the end when I stopped caring about the whole werewolf/vampire rivalry and Misery‚Äôs friend situation, but I was still intrigued enough to not put the book down once, so I won\'t complain.This was supposed to be a short review, but it didn\'t work out again, but if you are looking for a marriage in convenience romance, found family, werewolves and vamps, a slow-burn with, at least, in my opinion, great tension, don‚Äôt be shy and add it to your tbr.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîVampires and werewolfs?

I liked the plot, characters and romance.The paranormal romance and gothic vibes were really good, the whole environment was quite mesmerizing.Tho I would suggest that please don't go in expecting a world building- it's just romance. It's also quite fast paced and easy to binge. If you are in a reading slump, this is your cure.The characters are fun.Misery and Loweare truly made for each other. I love how they balance each other out. While Misery is unlike misery, in fact quite joyful and a fun vamp to be around. Lowe, on the other hand keeps to himself. I also noticed that Lowe although a werewolf, had a very Edward Cullen like personality. Instead of a typical douche, you are met with someone who actually cares. Misery's sarcasm and sense of humor was fun. Ali Hazelwood thankfully for once did not go over the top with it.The side characters-Ana, Serena and Alex were stand outs. Owen was kinda predictable. It also seems like there's something happening with Serena and Koen? Is there going to be another book? CAUSE I NEED IT!!!The romancewas pretty good.

Ali Hazelwood showed readers how to rock \'n\' roll in a fantasy universe by creating the most intelligent, quirky, nerdy heroine free of stereotypes and clich√©s. She possesses magical fingers that can sharpen computer skills for coding and breaking into highly secured werewolf territories!Themes of enemies to lovers and forbidden love may initially make us think we\'re in for a Twilight-like romance story. However, I assure you that this complex story offers so much more. Firstly, this book is more than a forbidden romance; it tells the tale of Misery Lark, the only daughter of the most powerful Vampyr councilman in the South, and Lowe Moreland, the most powerful Alpha of the Werewolves. Their marriage aims to bring peace and create an alliance between age-old mortal enemies. There\'s so much happening in the story, including political maneuvering and highly calculated schemes within the territories of werewolves and vampyres. A group of rebels, calling themselves the ""Loyals,"" whose lives have been spared by Lowe, seeks to avenge him by recruiting insiders from their inner circles, blackmailing them into committing treasonous acts.The story is filled with action-packed sequences, intricate world-building, and intercepted mysteries about Lowe\'s family line and Misery\'s inner circle, all of which intrigue readers to learn more. Interestingly, the adventure parts of the book slightly overshadow the romantic aspects. The fantasy world-building and the detailed rules and historical progress among werewolves, vampyres, and humans are depicted intelligently. I expected Ali Hazelwood to excel in the fantasy genre as much as in steamy romance, and I\'m thrilled to say she didn\'t disappoint.Here\'s a summary of the events in this book:After evading several attempts on her life, including bullets, knives, and other lethal weapons orchestrated to kill her, Misery leaves the Vampyre community to live in the human world with her best friend, Serena. She gets a job, wears contact lenses to conceal her irises, hides her fangs, and strives to create a peaceful life. However, her father summons her, proposing a marriage between werewolves and vampyres to establish an alliance during the reign of a new human governor. Misery is too smart not to take the bait, but as soon as she hears the name of the groom-to-be, she accepts the offer without asking for details. Is it a martyr complex, a personal concession, or does she have another agenda for her extremely masculine groom who cannot stand her scent?After the marriage ceremony proceeds without incident, if you discount the usual suicide attempts against Misery (she\'s become accustomed to these life-threatening situations since she was once a forced prisoner for a peace offering, but that\'s another story), Misery finds herself in her secluded mansion, surrounded by werewolves who despise her, searching for a reason to end the forced arrangement. Only six-year-old Anna, Lowe\'s little sister, acts friendly toward her despite her caregivers\' snarky comments about Misery.When Lowe senses the secret that threatens her unwanted marriage, he offers her an alliance to uncover the mysteries that will ultimately benefit them. However, not only their lives but also their hearts are at stake during this very perilous, full-throttle, wild adventure.Lowe is more than a vindictive alpha werewolf facade. He\'s loyal, perceptive, caring, and puts everyone\'s needs first. He\'s the first person to show how much he truly cares about her. Could she learn to trust and lower her emotional barricades to let him in?Overall, this is a smart, riveting, and highly entertaining quirky fantasy romance that I thoroughly enjoyed. I hope there will be more to come, as implied in the epilogue. I wholeheartedly congratulate my favorite steamy romance author for immersing me in a well-executed fantasy world, even though I\'m not a big fan of werewolves (I was never on Team Jacob).Many thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing this amazing book\'s digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest thoughts.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""what started off as promising went downhillquick.‚ï∞‚îà‚û§ first 1/3 of the book: solid 4 stars üòÑ‚ï∞‚îà‚û§ if i had skipped the spice: 3 stars üôÇ‚ï∞‚îà‚û§the book including theknotspice: 2 stars ü•¥‚ï∞‚îà‚û§ the spice alone: 0 stars. negative stars, even. jail.the spice wasknotit.it wasn't even the knot itself that was bad... it washowthe scenes were written. i amslightly?traumatized. i also traumatized my husband when i forced him to read some of the spice. at least i‚Äôm not alone in my misery.speaking of Misery...‚Ä¶ really? that is, no joke, the name of the fmc. need i say more?i hope i never have to think ofThe Home Depot‚ÄôsLowe‚Äôs strange, lumpy penis ever again.i am moving on now, goodbye. üëãüèªüòå""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""This isknotnot your typical Ali Hazelwood butif you are looking for a furr-ociously good time‚Ä¶no, no, that's too corny‚Ä¶mount up and‚Ä¶wait, too suggestive‚Ä¶sink your teeth into‚Ä¶ah hell‚Ä¶Okay soBrideby Ali Hazelwood is going to lend itself to a lot of jokes and I applaud Hazelwood for leaning into them because at its heart this is a fun and rather bitingly funny novel that brings us back into the veins of paranormal romance that dominated the early 2000s. A forced wedding between a vampire and werewolf (a big, beefy, beast of a man-beast) in order to uphold an uneasy truce kick off this story of paranormal politicking and high-energy action paired with a slow-burn romance of an enemies-to-lovers plot (okay it‚Äôs not really EtL, it‚Äôs more like vaguely-distrustful to lovers) that puts a new meaning to the term ‚Äúheavy petting‚Äù (pawing?). I tend to prefer romance stories that have a larger plot to hold them up, which is what we have here, though admittedly the plot is a bit lackluster and kind of conflates complicating the reveal of the politics and mysteries with actual complexity. Still this is a pretty fun read that highlights a lot of what Hazelwood does best in a very different scenario for her while also making it feel like a natural next step for her stories and I think this is one that if decide to bite in for some fun, you‚Äôll get just that.Oh, have I mentioned the werewolf is huge yet? Big shocker in a Hazelwood book, right? I mean, when I saw werewolf man we all knew this was coming (and so is he‚Ä¶) but guess what? Misery (oh yea, she named her Misery lol) is tall, so I‚Äôd like to applaud Hazelwood for some character growth. Oh, wait, sorry, Werewolf Lowe is actually so huge he can‚Äôt even fit in their single king-sized bed (if you are playing Romance Tropes drinking game, take a shot for single bed) so you be the judge if its still her big man little woman trope (if yes, take another shot). But it is sort of fun to see a lot of Hazelwood‚Äôs signature elements here and I suppose this is the paranormal offshoot of her STEM stories as Misery happens to be a computer genius and that comes in handy (paw-y?) here.There‚Äôs a lot going on here and without spoiling much, due to some long feud and a lot of weird truces that tend to involve hostages and interspecieseroticapairings, humans, werewolves and vampires are all poised and ready for bloodshed and this marriage is another stop-gap in that all. Misery now has to live amongst werewolves (they go by Weres which‚Ä¶okay I‚Äôll get to the world building soon but its not the best) who definitely want to kill her but shes so used to ‚Äòfeeling alone among people who were never supposed to be my own‚Äô after living with humans all life that she‚Äôs gonna give it the old college try! Good for her even if ‚Äòthe whole rival-species-bound-by-centuries-of-hostility-until-the-bloody-demise-of-the-weakest-will-put-an-end-to-the-senseless-suffering thing might seem discouraging.‚Äô Theres a slow moving romance as they move from utter distrust to relying on each other and Lowe being pretty damn into her while refusing to admit it and Misery refusing to notice that he‚Äôs pretty damn obvious because we need to stretch this already thin plot out with some romantic tension (drink). This is actually fairly light on the romance and the spicier stuff comes later and while this book does lean towards some omegaverse vibes it feels more a nod to all that than actually embracing it. Except knotting (take a shot). Hazelwood fans will enjoy this and they should, though I‚Äôm curious if those who might come to this from a deep love or paranormal romance might find it to read like a pop song cover of a deep-cut song they enjoy.This felt fairly undercooked though to me. In part because the world building is mostly done through conversation between Misery and Lowe, which is something I love in theory and found books likeThe Long Way to a Small, Angry Planetto brilliantly execute world building through picking up context in casual conversations between characters, but here the two are distrustful and all coy about revealing things. Its like pulling teeth because thats basically what they are doing to get answers out of each other and I found myself shaking the book screamingjust fucking tell me already(take another shot, not for tropes but in solidarity). Actually, Lowe is kind of annoying at times to be honest, even with his whole ‚Äútough alpha‚Äù schtick masking that he‚Äôs really a sweet sensitive boy packing a donkey sized dick (drink), and his whole ‚Äúwant better than me‚Äù thing was eye rolling. But anyways, the bigger catch is‚Ä¶none of the elements feel particularly fresh? And nobody wants a stale body if you are going to suck it‚Äôs blood, am i right vampires? A lot of it felt rather cut-and-paste or ‚Äúspot what this is inspired by‚Äù which sometimes made me realize I liked the techniques better in the other books. Theres definitely a BIGUnderworldfilm vibe here, and the whole sucking blood being orgasmic has been done before. I didn‚Äôt dislike this book but it made me actually realize I might like Butler‚ÄôsFledglingmore than I did before. It all works though, I just don‚Äôt think fantasy world building is Hazelwood‚Äôs greatest strength and a lot of the ambiguities work to ignore that a lot of it feels fairly flimsy.So will these two ‚Äòlive bitingly ever after‚Äô or will the politics of their world crush them? It‚Äôs worth a read, and I did like the characters quite a bit. I do like Misery asserting herself against and ‚Äúalpha‚Äù and him recognizing her as a strong woman with agency. The plot is pretty fun too with some good twists, and really I have nothing to complain about other than it just didn‚Äôt land as well for me as her YA book. It does seem to be both chasing a romantasy trend while also broadening and popularizing it so its sort of a publishing slam dunk and I think a lot of people will rightfully enjoy it. It‚Äôs left pretty open for a sequel, I‚Äôll look forward to finding out from your reviews because I think one was more than enough for me.2.5/5""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'yeah, this did KNOT serve ‚ú®Ô∏è'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'i enjoyed this way too much!!! rtc.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""DNF @ pg 229- I'm out ‚úåüèæeven the characters in the book were not taking the story seriously. how could I?""}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""it's giving jacob black x edward cullen (haven't read it yet tho)""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'brb, running to re-watch twilight + teen wolf üôÉ'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4.5‚≠êÔ∏èAli Hazelwood has me in a fucking chokehold, as per usual'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""ARC provided by the publisher via Netgalleyi feel like all my friends who also loved this one, were all by my side here on goodreads, back in the early 2010s, reading all the paranormal romances known to man (or that our moms kept on their bookshelves). the nostalgia for books likeriley jenson,black dagger brotherhood,kate danielswere so very felt. yet, this book completely stands on its own and is a really good book that i highly recommend.and this book had so many of my favorite paranormal romance trope sets - forbidden romance, bonded fated mates, and of course a marriage of convenience between our two main characters:‚ûõmisery- vampyre who has been living amongst humans her whole life, but finds herself as the key component in an alliance that will keep the peace with her people, while also having her own human inspired agenda for this forced arrangement.‚ûõlowe- werewolf alpha who is still asserting his new dominance over his people, while also trying to assess who he can trust or not, while also being an amazing caretaker for his little sister.‚ÄúI would take anything she chose to give me‚Äîthe tiniest fraction or her entire world.

where does one end and the other begin, if they do so at all?(which was a big thing that irked me with tpw. people would make criticisms of rfk\'s narrative choices and plot points and the response would be ‚Äòwell, rin is an unreliable narrator!‚Äô yes, but there is such thing asframingandcontextwhich are important things to consider when trying to figure out what an author actually is saying, intentionally or not. but anyways.)speaking of slightly more well-written unreliable narrators, juniper song is‚Ä¶ a character. more of an awful ball of jealous, racist, liberal misery who you get to follow the entertaining downward spiral of throughout the book than a person. at least, when she\'s not hindered by rfk\'s blunt writing style striking her on the head. the commentary and discussion yellowface wants to have about publishing and racism is genuinely interesting and important, but I enjoyed yellowface most when it doing less back-and-forth with its own themes and more about the fucked up relationship between athena liu and juniper song/june hayward/athena liu. ie,when it was more about actual people than rfk\'s comemntary.despite athena dying at the very start of the story, she haunts the narrative, sometimes through flashbacks, sometimes through other people‚Äôs experiences, sometimes literally. and the narrativeisjuniper. i love a good fucked up friendship/rivalry/impersonation?/whatever the fuck this is. there\'s a flashback where we find out about a fucked up thing athena did regarding a traumatic event juniper went through--something which in no way justifies the scale of what juniper does throughout the book, but muddies the waters and makes everyone involved seem like more flawed, three-dimensional people. keyword, people! and whenever that relationship had the spotlight, i couldn‚Äôt put yellowface down. it\'s insane the narrative spent more time on its self-indulgent satire than it does on its genuinely compelling emotional core.which is why i was really loving the third act, in which a lot of my criticisms seemed to fall away and the mess of the premise was really coming to a head. i was reading it late at night and, even though it‚Äôs not a horror, i got actually creeped out by several parts. to be honest, if yellowface had stuck the landing, it could have been four stars.and that‚Äôs my final problem with yellowface. it has a decent plot, interesting cast of characters, interesting themes and discussions, but my only feeling on the ending was,‚Äò‚Ä¶that‚Äôs it?‚Äôi know i said i wouldn‚Äôt do quotes, but im making an exception for the bit where our narrator says,‚ÄòI‚Äôve written myself into a corner. The first two thirds of the book were a breeze to compose, but what do i do with the ending? Where do I leave my protagonist, now that there‚Äôs no clear resolution?‚ÄôWhich is very meta, because based off the ending, i feel that‚Äôs the position rfk was in at that exact point. i can somewhat tell she struggled with where to take the ending and i have more thoughts on why i felt underwhelmed by it, but i guess that‚Äôll be for 2023, for when it\'s no doubt on all the \'Very Important Books of the Year\' lists. for now, i can see myself rereading babel and parts of tpw, but i don‚Äôt see myself rereading yellowface.it\'s now 2023. in short, the ending is less a bang, and more of a whimper. rfk rules out a geoff-style ending for june, someone who disappears quietly from public memory after the scandal and becomes old news. she\'s too attached to athena\'s image. this is the right choice--june is too much of a villain-protagonist to get an unearned, \'soft\' ending at the end of this. but then the \'crash-and-burn\' ending needed to be a lot more to be satisfying for me. we get hallucinations, suicidal ideation, her isolating herself from her support network, all of this building and building and building--and then it goes...nowhere.oh, we get a fascinating final confrontation with candace, one of athena\'s fellow asian-american authors, who gets to deliver the most cutting, messy and brutal line of the book:""Who gives a fuck about Athena? Fuck Athena. We all hated that bitch. This is for me.""but what happens after?we get a prediction from june, which is basically that the cycle of controvery and scandal that this whole book has shown us for however many hundreds of pages will just keep going, and going, and going, and maybe june will win (at least in her eyes). it\'s just such a nothing ending. sure, it\'s #commentary and a criticism of the publishing and media industry, but that does not make it satisfying. it\'s not an emotional resolution, and it\'s not even a more sophisticated commentary on the cyclical nature of scandal and how white people don‚Äôt face consequences than what the story has shown us already. we\'veseenthe cycle and her getting away with it. the whole book so far has been the cycle and her getting away with it. i think it\'s a good example of what i\'ve been saying, to be honest, about how yellowface is more about The Point than any story it\'s trying to tell. The ending is all about The Point, but is not an emotional resolution to anything developed or a conclusion to any charater arcs. just ""and this will continue, because doesn\'t it always continue? isn\'t this ending so clever?"" the worst part is that itteasesyou with the prospect of something more compelling: june plays with the idea of \'accidentally\' killing candace and knowing she would get away with it because she\'s a white woman, a horrific mirror to the start of the book and a sign of june\'s complete downward spiral, because at least Athena\'s death was an actual accident (and would be a frankly brutal commitment to the ‚Äúthey always get away with it‚Äù message). in a different moment, it makes you wonder if june may even be the one who might die an accidental death and now candace is the one to continue this twisted cycle, a horribly circular but somewhat karmic ending. instead, the cycle continues... in the most uninspired way possible. the third act of yellowface feels like it\'s hurtling towards a great ending and then face-plants over the finish line at the last minute. despite being a protagonist who is more well-suited for a crash-and-burn ending than any other i\'ve read, juniper song doesn\'t burn. she barely sizzles. and to me, that\'s disappointing.trigger warnings for this book: racism, c slur, suicidal ideation, sexual assaultedit 24/05/2023:unsurprisingly, some people on twitter cannot fucking read, so to clarify some things: 1)i am not white. i am asian,2) I DO NOT CARE THAT JUNE WAS IRREDEEMABLE. I DID NOT WANT A REDEMPTION FOR A RACIST. my main problem was that i found the way yellowface handled its themes came at the cost of other aspects of the story when it should have been making them better. 3) ""[insert criticism here] is literally the whole point of the story omgggg how could you miss the point so bad did you even pass english lit in school etc etc."" personally, i do not enjoy 300 pages of on-the-nose commentary through uncompelling mouthpieces. i especially find it questionable when some of these mouthpieces flatly reflect criticisms the authors has actually received in regards to her previous work. if you do, more power to you! if what i disliked about the book is what you enjoyed about it, well, that\'s just how having an opinion works. i don\'t know what to tell you. i can definitely understand how someone who isn\'t as aware of some of the meta-commentary would have more enjoyment. but i find the response that i ""missed the point"" (to be honest, the writing constantly tries its best to be Desperately Sure You Are Not Missing The Point) that this book is about racism by some white readers when i\'m intimately familiar with racism, both as it pertains to real life and in media, kind of... well. racist.in a way, i guess this book is perfect for booktwitter. a lot of recognisable discourse where the Message and Themes are written out for you in big bold letters, constantly, all the time, throughout the story, just in case you missed it‚Äîthat way, even your average reading-comprehension-starved twitter user can pick up on it‚Äîpadded with enough relatable material about being chronically online and plenty of fictional ragebait to distract from a narrative that can‚Äôt get its teeth into its own premise and a third act that can‚Äôt deliver. target audience acquired.in line with the theme of the book, i‚Äôm going to completely steal another reviewer‚Äôs words that i can‚Äôt stop thinking about.\'the problem with kuang is that, despite a reputation for in-depth research, she refuses to interrogate beyond her scope.\'go read it. and i‚Äôd like to add to that: a lot of her most avid readers don‚Äôt have the appetite for anything beyond that, either. and take it incredibly personally when at the end of the meal, you‚Äôre still hungry.and to be clear, this isn\'t a blanket response to everyone who disagrees with me (i\'ve had interesting conversations with people who do)--just to some people who are determined to take the most uncharitable opinion possible of a frankly lukewarm review.a book can be about an important subject matter and i can still feel it fell short of what it was trying to do. that is not me putting personal attack on the author, the author\'s identity, the subject matter itself, or any readers who enjoyed the book or their identities. i didn\'t even hate the book. i liked parts of it quite a bit. i just wanted more.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '‚ÄòDon‚Äôt ghosts just want to be remembered?‚ÄôA book about fucking around and finding out.The question of who should or shouldn‚Äôt tell a story has been a hotly debated subject, a discourse that must also recognize the playing field is guided by rules of capitalism in a for-profit publishing industry and a social climate that prods ‚Äúculture wars‚Äù to increase clicks. Still in recent memory are the debates overAmerican Dirt, which sparkedmonths of controversyover white authors using another‚Äôs cultural narrative as what many considered ‚Äútrauma porn,‚Äù but also over the publisher‚Äôs decision to throw incredible amounts of marketing money at this book when immigration stories by authors living within the culture were being passed over for that novel. R.F. Kuang‚ÄôsYellowfacesinks its teeth into the world of publishing and the discourses on authenticity through the eyes of June Hayward, a white woman who has taken the draft of a Chinese-American woman‚Äôs novel and published it as her own. She will forever be haunted by this choice, like a Lady Macbeth of letters haunted by bloodstains in her attempt to usurp the kingdom. It is a perfect follow-up toBabeland the conversations on how language can be a form of colonialism, though this one has no magical elements like the former. Instead,Yellowfacereads like a scandal unfolding before your eyes and transfixes the reader with all the sick satisfactions that keep us scrolling through social media debates and keep hot takes. Kuang makes us sit with our discomfort, through an excellent choice of an unreliable narrator, and forces us to confront our own opinions on the matter. With a sharp critique on the commodification and consumption of art in publishing and reviewing (even Goodreaders are not spared here), a look at online debates, the self-aggrandizing aspects of social media, and the way artists are pitted against each other as if writing was a competitive sport, Kuang‚ÄôsYellowfaceasks big questions on authenticity and identity in a society that has reduced the concepts into marketing metrics.I‚Äôll be honest, I read this book in a single sitting. I could not look away, and Kuang‚Äôs writing sweeps you up in it‚Äôs conversational cadance. While I‚Äôve enjoyed Kuang‚Äôs writing previously,Yellowfacefeels very polished and matured, the novel reading with the ease and eagerness of a tell-all memoir, which is the framing of the story. As a fictional memoir, it drops a lot of pop culture references to key into a specific time. Kuang‚Äôs choice of perspective through June‚Äîwho rebrands at the request of her publisher as Juniper Song, Song being her middle-name but also nudges readers to think she may have Chinese heritage‚Äîis brilliant as it allows us to feel the floor-dropping-out discomfort of becoming the focus of internet rage as well as navigate a vigorous criticism of the publishing industry. Kuang is able to cover issues without moralizing, making the reader sift through alternating opinions that are likely to expose their own assumptions and discomforts, and we must always remember the telling is often guiding us away from judging her and towards everyone else. With a big confession at the center, June can manipulate the reader on smaller issues and in a way it becomes a rather metafictional approach to the way storytelling is just that: fictionalizing stories.Kuang does well by creating a character that isn‚Äôt entirely unsympathetic‚Äîwe need to want to keep reading her take on the events‚Äîand hate reading is a shallow effect that evaporates quickly. Not unlike the social media scandals that hit viciously and are forgotten days later. Not that June is innocent, and being disgusted with her is half the fun, but Kuang will force us to consider what exactly it is that disgusts us and what that means in a larger context about art and the commodification of it. WeÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩve seen these sorts of scandals, such as a personal favorite bizarre tale of Natalie Beach who wrote about beingthe ghostwriter for Caroline Calloway, or last year‚ÄôsWho Is the Bad Art Friend?article concerning Sonya Larson and Dawn Dorland where everyone seemed to be too thrilled by the mess to not pick a side. Though the story that seems closest toYellowfaceis the one surroundingKristen Roupenian‚Äôs short storyCat Person(you canread it here) which was defended then later attacked whenan article revealing the details was taken from a strangers real life, told to the author by the man who was fictionalized in the story as the sex pest and later committed suicide in real life. Twitter was full of well-known authors debating if personal details and stories of others are always fair game, even though the hometown and place of employment of the girl was not changed for the published version (my college roommate later rented the house Roupenian had previously lived in and describes in story). Literary twitter was confronted with a situation about what level of authenticity is appropriate and can someone tell someone else‚Äôs story.The way social media fuels a fire is at the heart of this story, with twitter challenging authenticity and morals at all times. Which becomes a tragic interplay at the way authors are demanded to be vulnerable, to seek authenticity and expose their pain for book sales, yet social media loves to exploit personal details and use vulnerabilities as an opening for an attack.‚Äòdozen, maybe hundreds, maybethousandsof strangers are out there, mining your personal information, worming their ways into your life, looking for ways to mock, humiliate, or worse, endanger you. You come to regret everything you‚Äôve ever shared about yourself‚Ä¶because the trollswillfind them.‚ÄôWe‚Äôve all most likely criticized a stranger on social media, sometimes the pile-ups are too fun and humorous to not get a joke in, but Kuang tries to remind us that the targets are real people with real feelings. Sure, June deserves to be exposed and feel bad for what she‚Äôs done, but Kuang puts us in her shoes and lets you feel what being a target is like. Because it can come for anyone, even Athena was once the target of harassment, death threats and hacking where she didn‚Äôt feel safe all for being called a ‚Äòrace traitor‚Äô for dating a white man. ‚ÄòIn destroying her,‚Äô June narrates the voice of social media, ‚Äòwe create an audience we create moral authority for ourselves.‚Äô Such is the nature of social media in the state of a scandal, and all for what? ‚ÄòAllegations get flung left and right, everyone‚Äôs reputations are torn down, and when the dust clears, everything remains exactly as it was.‚Äô Nothing changes, but, as we see in the novel, much of this is because someone profits from it. A scandal often turns into book sales (for all the complaintsAmerican Dirtwas canceled it still remained a bestseller for months) and if you keep selling books you keep getting published.‚ÄòThe living are burdened with bodies. They make shadows, footprints.‚ÄôBut lets move to the scandal at hand. Here we have June, who has a tepid friendship with rising literary star Athena Liu. She feels jealous as well as annoyance with Athena, fantasizing how she‚Äôd like to ‚Äòneatly peel her skin off her body like an orange and zip it up over myself,‚Äô something she is soon metaphorically doing when she edits the now deceased Athena‚Äôs manuscript: a WW1 novel about Chinese laborers. It starts off innocently enough (or so June claims) being an exercise in editing that she gets so caught up in loving writing again that she passes it off as herself. It is titledThe Last Front, is praised for a mosaic storytelling style reminiscent of the filmDunkirkand becomes an instant bestseller. She will spend the novel fiercely defending she has the right to tell this story‚Äîsometimes being rewarded such as when speaking at a Chinese American Social Club she is thanked by a man who‚Äôs Chinese father fought in the war for making sure their stories are told‚Äîyet at the end of the day, this never was her story. And while she can be a great writer, we see she is never able to come up with her own ideas and the ones she have is derivative of other stories. It is a subtle and clever nod to a gap between being a good writer and being a good author or creator (an offer to write for existing IP disgusts her, perhaps because she is confronted by what she doesn‚Äôt want to admit is her strength).‚ÄòIt all boils down to self-interest‚Ä¶If publishing is rigged, you might as well make sure it\'s rigged in your favor.‚ÄôWhile the marketing grab here is definitely the idea of colonizing another‚Äôs work and culture and passing it off as your own (there are many moments for readers to fist bump the novel and say ‚ÄúHAHA take that shit, ‚ÄúJunie‚Äù‚Äù) Kuang makes this a symptom of a larger issue. In her acknowledgements, Kuang states that the novel is a ‚Äòhorror story about loneliness in a fiercely competitive industry.‚Äô If your ears perked up at horror story, therearesome horror elements late in the novel (though perhaps not enough and it could have been threaded in longer, if I have one complaint it is that the novels episodic feel never quite let individual elements breathe enough and makes the last portion feel a bit like going one step more than needed instead of flowing from the book which would have sidestepped that feeling? Maybe thats just me though). But loneliness does permeate this tale, and we see how authors can feel crushed under the way for-profit publishing makes it a competition who awards winners and losers. One author will get a huge deal and seemingly inexhaustible marketing, while another gets one small print run and no publisher support. Kuang looks at publishing as a rigged enterprise, with a small team of (mostly white) executives deciding what gets sold and more or less deciding what will be a bestseller and informing readers to follow suit. Its not a secret that publishers buy space in chain bookstores or that the Big 5 US publishers are80% of all publishing revenue. It is a market based on profit, and will be manipulated to ensure profits keep coming.‚ÄòThis industry is built on silencing us, stomping us into the ground, and hurling money at white people to produce racist stereotypes of us.‚ÄôTo June, however, she sees diversity as a problem, thinking she is passed over for authors like Athena because it looks good. Which, if we look at the publishing market, shows that about75% of published authors in the US are whiteand a 2020 study showed95% of all books published were by white authorsthe previous year.Now everyone probably remembers 2020 was the year many corporations made pledges to be better at diversity, the publishing industry under extra scrutiny as Black authors and anti-racism books were topping the best sellers and showing there was indeed a market for such books, but lets look at the industry itself. Since then,a recent survey shows only a 1% changein the industry, with it being 83% white and that most non-white hires since 2020 are for marketing positions. Which is using ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù as a sales technique again.So what June see‚Äôs as a fast-track to success is actually a steep uphill climb. ‚Äò""Do you know how much shit Athena got from this industry?‚Äô a character remarks late in the novel, ‚ÄòThey marked her as their token, exotic Asian girl. Every time she tried to branch out to new projects, they kept insisting that Asian was her brand, was what her audience expected.‚Äô To be a brand is what publishing reduces identity into is the argument seen in the novel. And, if one is reduced to being a brand of themselves, they are now in market competition. I think of author Brandon Taylor saying identity becomes a marketing pitch, and howReal Lifewas reviewed as about identity when he says it was about lonely that happened to have explorations of identity in the book. I\'m reminded of thereasons authors pushed against #OwnVoiceslabels asBecky Albertallifelt forced to come out to ""justify"" her book and others felt boxed in by it.‚ÄòDo you know what it\'s like to pitch a book and be told they already have an Asian writer? That they can\'t put out two minority stories in the same season? That Athena Liu already exists, so you\'re redundant?‚ÄôKuang examines how the idea of being a brand exists in the outskirts of publishing as well. We have the twitter fights where people exist as a self-brand of being antagonists, we have goodreads reviewers where their brand is taking down popular authors (some lines that may sting are remarks from other authors to not read goodreads and harsh takes are more about feeding ego than worthwhile criticism), and journalists who make a brand at hot takes. However, we have to remember that June is directing us to look at howeveryone elseis the problem instead of her. So while through her telling many of the critiques are cast as villains, the fictional journalist Adele Sparks-Sato (a nod toAndrea Long ChuasVartika pointed out) is not wrong when writing that June‚Äôs version of Athena‚Äôs novel ‚Äòjoins novels likeThe HelpandThe Good Earthin a long line of what I dub historical exploitation novels: inauthentic stories that use troubled pasts as an entertaining set piece for white entertainment.‚Äô‚ÄòThe appropriation of history, the historicization of the past, the narrativization of society, all of which give the novel its force, include the accumulation and differentiation of social space, space to be used for social purposes.‚Äô-Edward Said,Culture and ImperialismThere is a good deal of nuance in this book about how the commodification of art is an issue, but also a reminder that we can‚Äôt scapegoat our own actions on that entirely. There are some great little jabs in this‚ÄîJunie Song ordering a Miss Saigon drink only to find it ‚Äútoo sweet‚Äù for her tastes‚Äîand it does emphasize the problems of representing a different culture from a western lens. AsEdward Saidwrote ‚Äòthe power to narrate, or to block other narratives from forming and emerging is very important to culture and imperialism,‚Äô and argued that literature can be a form of colonialism by establishing a perception of a different culture or geography, and in the editing process ofThe Last Frontwe watch June make concessions on the text in order to appeal more to a white reader as requested by her publisher. Yes, she did actually do a great deal of research, and her opinion is the criticisms of cultural issues in the book are ‚Äòexclusive cultural snobbishness and authenticity testing‚Äô that ‚Äòare only a form of gatekeeping,‚Äô though later criticisms of her book are that her misunderstanding of how names or families work, or how her positions on certain issues imply a stance on current Chinese politics that are so beyond her understanding can be harmful. Some readers find it to read as a white-savioir narrative, something we know was manufactured by changing certain characters to be white characters to better fit the market needs. Which also returns us to the idea that art under capitalism will always be in service to profits.Yellowfaceby R.F. Kuang is a delightful novel with the fierceness of an unfolding scandal that makes us confront many key issues hotly debated in the literary world right now. I enjoyed the nuance here in how it exposes problems from many angles, but does not allow that to be an excuse for bad behavior. Understanding is not the same as condoning here, and it is a page-turning trip watching June dip and dodge as her usurped empire continuously threatens to crash down around her. Kuang writes with confidence and precision andYellowfacemakes for an excellent look at the literary world and the commodification of art.4.5/5‚ÄòIsn‚Äôt that what ghosts do? Howl, moan, make themselves into spectacles? That‚Äôs the whole point of a ghost, is it not? Anything to remind you that they‚Äôre still there. Anything to keep you from forgetting.‚ÄôUpdate: I got to hear R.F. Kuang speak about the book yesterday! She was DELIGHTFUL, discussed why she dislikes how publishing turns identity into marketing metrics, the booksBeautiful World, Where Are You, Ferrante\'s Neapolitan novels and told everyone to readMurderbot. So well spoken, intelligent, and a real wonderful author.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'lmao.the frustration, as always, is that rf kuang is an intelligent and steady-handed writer. she is ahead of many of her peers in craft as much as sales: she writes a page-turner, she crafts a strong perspective, she is horror-writer good at making the reader feel gut-churning revulsion (whether or not she earns the strong emotion she likes to pull out is another question), and in this book she\'s capable of being funny. like here\'s a perfect paragraph, in which our pernicious white heroine works with her editor to chop and change the manuscript she stole:The hardest part is keeping track of all the characters. We change almost a dozen names to reduce confusion. Two different characters have the last name Zhang, and four have the last name Li. Athena differentiates them by giving them different first names, which she only occasionally uses, and other names that I assume are nicknames (A Geng, A Zhu; unless A is a last name and I‚Äôm missing something), or Da Liu and Xiao Liu, which throws me for a loop because I thought Liu was a last name, so what are Da and Xiao doing there? Why are so many of the female characters named Xiao as well? And if they‚Äôre family names, does that mean everyone is related? Is this a novel aboutincest? But the easy fix is to give them all distinct monikers, and I spend hours scrolling through pages on Chinese history and baby name sites to find names that will be culturally appropriate.like it\'s absolutely executing all of its tricks as it should: the blinkers of a close first person perspective, the legible different reality underneath. it\'s not subtle but when done in satire it\'s not AS hamhanded as kuang\'s dramatic instincts, per other books. readers who know chinese will scream, readers who don\'t will still feel their brain itch. the authorial hand is capable.the author is capable... of more than she writes. the problem with kuang is that, despite a reputation for in-depth research, she refuses to interrogate beyond her scope. in previous books that meant that the sense of history was strong and the rest of the work of writing fiction‚Äîcharacter work, plot, tone, anything reliant on the imagination‚Äîwas comparatively weak. here there\'s no research to hold it up, just kuang\'s own posting habits and career success. the step down from jstor to twitter is a violent stumble.kuang is an accomplished academic but a deeply incurious writer. that is on sharp display here, in a book that is meant to depict success and failure in the literary-commercial circuit‚Äîsomething that kuang knows little about. kuang is a genre writer who achieved crossover commercial success after blowing up on tiktok. her debut was promising and lauded but not uniquely vaunted; she received genre award noms (not wins) but her books blew up on tiktok after the fact and she launched an incredibly successful book this yearin the genre space, off the back of her tiktok fame. everything she knows about succeeding she knows about inside her particular bubble, and also, because she has been succeeding since she was an undergrad baby, has been told‚Äîand genuinely believes‚Äîthat she has hit the summit of success. this leaves her totally inequipped to write about what literary success looks like when engineered by the house. r.f. kuang has no belief that there is a form of publishing greatness beyond that which has been bestowed upon r.f. kuang, and a wilful desire not to google further.the \'publishing details\' on display are... well, they all exist IN publishing, curate a FORM of commercial success, and are familiar to kuang, but they don\'t match the book as described here (a lit-commercial wwii doorstopper, written by a chinese-american author and butchered into commercial sentimentality by a white author and editor, think the bulletproof success of american dirt even in the thick of its cancellation). mainstream literary successes don\'t come up through pitchwars. mainstream commercial novels don\'t come up in most book box deals because there is a form of literary success that is not reliant on superfans buying multiple copies apiece. there\'s a part where our heroine lists the major american literary awards her major literary-commercial war novel is up for and starts with: the goodreads choice awards. posting FROM this bad website: please be serious. it\'s fitting that the cover looks more like a designed arc than like a book.there\'s a note in the babel prologue that i think about all the time with kuang\'s work, where she says that she was so dazzled by the sight of an oyster tower at a particular oxford party that she put it in the book even though oysters in victorian england were trash food for peasants‚Äîshe didn\'t want to capture the dazzle or the waste so much as she wanted to write down her experience beat for beat, and could not conceive of an emotional reality that she did not personally live. this is an oyster tower book. this is embarrassing and technically inaccurate mimesis all the way down, solely interested in kuang\'s own interests. wow your heroines live in dc? and you lived in dc? they met at yale? you go to yale? omigod rebecca that\'s so crazy. there was a shorthand term back in the sporking days (i know, i hate my withered hag fingers for typing this too) on LIVEJOURNAL (HAG FINGERS) called \'pepper jack cheese\' that was like ""hermione ate a sandwich with pepper jack cheese (a/n: that\'s my favorite cheese!)"", the phenomenon where the author would gigglingly and obviously insert a few of their real-life favorite things into the story. kuang\'s pepper jack cheese is whistlepig whiskey, name-dropped bafflingly twice as a signifier for the nicest possible whiskey, and also every single detail.it is like. skin-crawlingly secondhand embarrassing to watch an author write their own life beat for beat and also be like \'everyone hated her because she was TOO pretty and TOO smart\'. every critique that has ever been leveled against kuang goes into the mouth of her proxy\'s haters, including the pernicious and grasping white heroine. the belief that her haters are racist comes in a distant second to the belief that her haters are jealous‚Äîof her success, of her telegenic prettiness, of her comfortable life. maybe baby but look at the material: there\'s room for improvement. it is disappointing to watch someone technically skilled grind their intellectual curiosity down to a nub via posting and self-obsession, and it\'s humiliating to watch an oxbridge-ivy phd student say \'talk to the hand! and DON\'T tell me to log off\' for three hundo pages. is this the best she can do? does SHE think this is the best she can do? i\'m worried that she does.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Whew child. Some of these reviews are doing exactly what Kuang was pointing out throughYellowface. It‚Äôs interesting to watch it happen in real time. While I don‚Äôt have extensive knowledge of her work, I think what Kuang is doing in this book is actually quite brilliant.At the most basic of levels,Yellowfaceis a mash of various genres that follows the passive aggressive ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù of Athena and June, two authors in the publishing industry with very different levels of success. Athena has received her big break while June has remained a struggling author. In an absurd (truly absurd if I‚Äôm being quite honest haha) turn of events, Athena chokes while engaging in a pancake eating contest with June. After her death, June makes the decision to steal one of her manuscripts and pass it off as her own. What follows next is chaotic descent into the world of publishing and the book community.What Worked:SO MUCH OF THIS BOOOK WORKED! I‚Äôve seen the countless criticisms of Kuang inserting herself too much into this book as well as the criticisms that indicate that there isn‚Äôt much to be gained from reading this book. I wholeheartedly disagree. Oh, my friends, there is much to be gained. Neither of the characters is likeable and that is INTENTIONAL. This isn‚Äôt a way to illustrate that everyone in publishing is selfish, but a means to question how much the reader falls into the trap of engaging with the model minority myth. The expectation that Athena is supposed to be likeable is deeply woven in the sociological phenomena that stereotypes many Asian communities as successful, smart, likeable, diligent, docile, etc and the idea that Athena doesn‚Äôt fit into that role has made some readers feel uncomfortable whether it is consciously or subconsciously.Kuang‚Äôs evaluation of the publishing industry is layered and forces both publishing and the bookish community to do some reevaluation. What she singlehandedly captures in this book has been the biggest criticism that many of us have been vocal about since 2020. Publishing used the death of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement to claim to want more diversity and has in some ways published more diverse books; however, have we really paid attention to what those stories have centered? Trauma versus joy. So many of these stories have been centered on generational trauma, books that are used to educate and make the White masses feel better about not knowing much about diverse experiences prior to 2020. Marginalized voices in publishing are ‚Äúpermitted‚Äù to be a part of the community as long we play the roles that we are supposed to play. Once we begin to infiltrate the industry too much, those same people with ‚ÄúBLM‚Äù in their twitter bios, the same people who claim to be liberal do the same damn mental gymnastics June did to excuse her behavior. The system was designed for June to do what she did and the moment that marginalized communities ‚Äústeal‚Äù the shine, it‚Äôs okay to push back because as June believes she‚Äôs the true minority and oppressed person in all of this. Don‚Äôt believe me, you should check out the TikTok made by an author who claims that white writers now get turned down because all agents want are BIPOC writers. Or better yet, just listen to foolishness that was uttered from James Patterson who had the audacity to state the White men are the truly oppressed writers in the industry.And let‚Äôs take this a step further and look at how Kuang illustrated the danger that publishing has ultimately created with it‚Äôs use of terms like #ownvoices. Athena wasn‚Äôt ever allowed to write outside of trauma. She‚Äôs pigeonholed into only writing one thing. And honestly, I‚Äôm sure that happens more than we would like to believe. Authors who want to explore something outside of their ‚Äúassigned‚Äù roles either get turned down or the marketing is trash. It delves deeper into the question of who is allowed to tell what story? Was Athena any better of a fit to tell the story of Chinese laborers of WWI than June? Is research enough to tell something outside of one‚Äôs lived experience? These are things to think about and something that we are confronted with every day in this community. Think about books likeAmerican DirtandMemoirs of a Geisha.This book is both absurd and unhinged because so is publishing and the book community. And I‚Äôve been involved in all of it for so many years. Kuang told ya‚Äôll to kiss her ass with this book. She is behaving in the complete opposite manner that is ‚Äúexpected‚Äù of her as young, thin, conventionally beautiful Asian woman. And the fact that she owns that shit makes so many people feel uncomfortable. And quite frankly I applaud her for that. BIPOC writers and creators are tired of the expectation that we are supposed to behave, create, write, and provide educational pieces in way that makes others feel comfortable. We‚Äôre supposed to applaud White people for the amazing work they‚Äôve done in ‚Äúallowing‚Äù us to enter the spaces and ‚Äúgive‚Äù us the opportunity to tell ‚Äúour stories.‚Äù It‚Äôs laughable at this point and while ya‚Äôll give Kuang these 1 and 2 star reviews, she‚Äôs going to be laughing her pretty, thin, and educated ass all the way to the damn bank.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'If publishing is rigged, you might as well make sure it‚Äôs rigged in your favor.4.5 stars. Holy shit, I had an absolute blast reading this! I inhaled it in a day. Forgive me if I make no sense because I stayed up late to finish it!To be honest, I wasn\'t going to readYellowface. I found Kuang\'sBabelto be so painfully boring and didactic, like reading a textbook, that I thought we were parting ways for good. But then it seemed like everyone I know read this and liked it, so curiosity got the better of me.And, wow, is this really the same author? What a ride. The suspense! The vitriol! The fucking audacity!I want to take a moment to acknowledge something I found quite ironic-- Kuang\'s other books are fantasy books about magic and colonialism and boarding schools while this one has the very lukewarm premise of being about authors and the publishing process... but, my god, when it comes to pageturners evenThe Poppy Warhad nothing on this.A satire, is it? Well, maybe, but I\'ve never read such a gripping and suspenseful satire. Kuang rips the publishing industry to shreds with this book, and she does it from the perspective of a white author who steals the first draft manuscript of a dead Chinese author.I sat open-mouthed pretty much the entire time wondering if she was going to get away with it or get caught. Kuang uses a lot of social media to tell this story and it is highly effective at keeping the pacing up. We all know social media is a shitstorm of people vying for attention, performing for validation and, occasionally, making genuinely important points, and we see it all play out here to the extreme.I thoughtBabellacked nuance, butYellowfaceis the complete opposite. Both June and Athena are complex characters. Athena is not allowed to simply be the perfect victim and, in fact, what emerges over the course of the novel is someone who is quite unlikable herself. June has done something objectively bad, but the author resists the temptation to paint her as one-dimensional. Her desperation and self-delusion, her anxiety and her jealousy, feel real.At first glance, June appears to be the villain, but I think it becomes clear as the story progresses that this is much bigger than June. Kuang calls out the publishing industry and the messed up way books are primarily marketed through a social media performance. The young authors choking on their jealousy as they are pitted against one another. The agents and editors urging authors to publish ‚Äúanything‚Äù while they have ‚Äúsocial capital‚Äù regardless of whether it‚Äôs good or not.And, of course, the way many in the publishing industry view ""diversity"" as a marketing buzzword to sell more books, rather than having the genuinely noble goal of diversifying literature. As Brett, June\'s agent, admits at one point:""But at the end of the day all that really matters is cash flow.""This is a chaotic, highly-frustrating, impossible-to-put-down book. I rollercoasted from emotion to emotion reading it and I\'m sure I will still be talking about it long after I\'m done writing this review.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is a compelling, cynical, and thought-provoking satire that delves into themes of plagiarism, racism, and internet trolling. It offers a realistic portrayal of the publishing industry within the framework of a heart-pounding thriller. The story revolves around an anti-heroine driven by power and insecurity, who assumes the identity of her deceased friend to publish a masterpiece. Loneliness and the desperate desire for recognition serve as driving forces, pushing the protagonist to extreme measures.Remarkably, I found myself attached to a book despite disliking the main character. At times, I wished I could physically enter the story and confront June Hayward/ Juniper Song, who committed the ultimate crime: stealing her late friend Athena Liu\'s unpublished book. The reasons behind this act of creative theft are complex and include jealousy, thirst for power, honoring her friend\'s work in the best way possible, and seeking personal gain. It is a tale that explores unfairness, harbored resentment, and a thirst for karmic justice.One of the standout aspects of the book is the author\'s astute commentary on the perils faced by writers, such as internet trolls who use their freedom of speech rights to berate and belittle their creations. The story skillfully examines the commodification of writers, where their looks, personality, color of their skin and online presence become as important as their writing itself.This book truly blew my mind. I was unable to put it down, yet also needed to take breaks due to the chaotic and anxiety-inducing experience of living within Juniper\'s mind. The character evokes strong emotions, including frustration towards her misogyny, blind ambition, and obnoxious justifications for her actions.It is worth noting that Juniper is not the sole antagonist in the narrative. The judgmental and self-righteous individuals surrounding her also exhibit misogynistic tendencies and relish in criticizing and witnessing the downfall of others, all while raising their champagne glasses in celebration. Even Athena, portrayed as socially awkward and naive, adds depth to the story as a potential soul-sucking character for a gripping plotline.In this book, nobody is a saint, as being good-hearted does not guarantee financial security, career success, fame, or power. The author skillfully portrays flawed and complex characters who challenge the reader\'s perceptions.Overall, this realistic and thrilling read left me feeling anxious and evoked a multitude of emotions including fear, hate, and sadness. It successfully accomplished its mission of shaking the reader to their core and provoking deep thoughts that linger for days. The essence of a masterpiece lies in its ability to challenge readers and evoke a range of feelings, and this book achieves just that.I wholeheartedly consider this one of the best books of the year, and I urge you not to overlook it or let it languish in your ""to be read"" list.

You write 'em, I read 'em. And the ones I like best tend to be a little bit tongue-in-cheek and satirical, inviting you to see the world through the plagiarist's eyes. After all, they're not really bad people, are they? They see a story that needs telling, and they're the ones to tell it. So what if the story isn't theirs to tell in the first place?And soYellowfaceenters that arena with its own take on this eyebrow-raising topic. And right off the bat, I'm intrigued. June is an interesting plagiarist-protagonist. She starts off as a writer struggling for relevance, and that struggle is something we can all relate to. It's not as if she decides to become a plagiarist overnight. No, it's a slippery slope of small decisions, each one understandable on its own, that ultimately lands her in such an ignoble profession.Once I started, I couldn't put it down. June's voice is as compelling as it is grotesque, and it's hard to look away from such self-inflicted catastrophe. You know this isn't going to turn out well, and yet she just keeps going. The best satires always elicit a lot of wincing, and that definitely happened here.I don't mind telling you guys that this story made me uncomfortable. And I'm sure that is R.F. Kuang's intention. June isn't some crazy thief, at least not initially. Rather, she's drawn as this morally ambiguous, somewhat sympathetic character. In fact, from certain angles, she looks almost downright reasonable, making the best of what she's got. And this sly characterization leaves the reader both fascinated and uneasy, for we feel drawn towards June even though she is the villain of this tale. And that cognitive dissonance stays with us throughout.The first half of the book was particularly strong for me because of that perfect balance between hero and antihero. There's a lot of subtlety that allows June to be both appealing and repulsive. However, once we get to June's book release and her subsequent guilt and justification, it does start to take on more and more of a crazed tinge, and as a result, lost a lot of the subtlety that made the first half so compelling for me.There is a lot packed into this little story: racial commentary, inside look at being a writer and the publishing industry, internet trolling, cultural appropriation. And it's all done seamlessly. I have to applaud the author for both not being afraid to wade into these interesting topics, as well as saying something of substance about each of them.What a fascinating story this turned out to be. Subversive and uncomfortable, it really drew me in and kept me glued to the pages.

This is a book worthy of discussion. It has both blatant and nuanced themes of racism and xenophobia that might go over some reader\'s heads or might seem too in-your-face for others. A group discussion can help reader\'s recognize the realism of R.F.

But you will walk away with a greater understanding of the many failings of the publishing industry and how you might be unconsciously taking part in some of those failings.It\'s eye opening. It\'s ballsy. It\'s crass. It\'s wild and brilliant.I will say that the half star reduction is solely because of Candice. While her insistence upon sensitivity reader\'s was a good call in my opinion, her manner of calling things out and getting things done were over-dramatized to the nth degree. While I think R.F. Kuang is brilliant for having the opposing side of June also be contrarian, Candice didn\'t fill the spot I wanted her to in opposition to June. I know it wasn\'t a character to necessarily root for instead of June. But I saw June\'s motives and her horrible mental manipulation that she attempted to gaslight ourselves into believing were just. But Candice just felt cartoonishly villainous.

But that\'s the direct opposite approach she takes. Her self-insert is actually with Athena, the main character\'s college friend turned renowned author.The main character is a depiction of mild mannered racist individuals who shroud themselves in acceptance as long as it doesn\'t affect them and balk at the idea of racism until directly faced with equality and the loss of superiority it gives them.This is an excellent look at how real and deep rooted racism is. It\'s everywhere and in everyone. It just isn\'t always shouting it\'s ideals. It\'s sitting still while someone else does something harmful. It\'s deluding yourself when you get the job over someone of color when you know you\'re under qualified. It\'s in so many small and micro ways. And it\'s absolutely vile to watch/read. But very eye opening in a way that I think is necessary for the publishing industry as it stands.I so appreciate RF Kuang for writing this and continuing to be an absolute genius.

It was so in-depth into the industry it made my heart sing and despare at the same time (as a publishing post-graduate first and then as a compulsive reader part of the online community). It managed to highlight a slew of things that make publishing not such a great place to be at in very few pages and I'm amazed. To me this book kind of felt like a very long article but with twists and turns. Now I know why they released arcs so early (looking at you, HarperCollins üëÄ). Book twitter will have a field day with this one...What a choice to have the main narrative voice be the plagiarizer (and in first person at that).Both Athena and June are awful people, and I love that neither of them is a saint, but reading the entire thing from June's pov? Insane. She's a frustrating character, not gonna lie, but she's also deliciously realistic as a two-faced, self-absorbed and dishonest manipulator that always has an excuse ready. She goes out of her way to say to the reader that she wants to do something for poc every chance she gets, but the reality is that she's a bitch trying to profit from it all in an industry that lets her do it. Sometimes it's subtle, sometimes it's not too difficult to miss her slipping into a plain wrong mentality and lol, basic whiteness.You think you're safe as the external reader? Not a chance.I'm not proud to say I fell straight into R.F. Kuang's trap, because was I seriously rooting for such a cheater the entire time? This book brainwashed me into supporting someone who stole a whole manuscript immediately after witnessing the author's death and reaching stardom by publishing it as her own. I got to the point where I was scared she was going to get caught and hoped she would get out of it unscathed.My brain ignored all the red flags and procedeed to scam me until the very end.I mean, of course I ended up wishing she would kill someone to shut them up. Of course I got second-hand anxiety from her messing up with her publishing team and at her events. Of course I cared about her mental health. Am I okay or what? Is it time for me to get theraphy too?On the other hand, Athena is harder to grasp.You really need to have the whole picture with her, which you only get by reading the book till the end.I loved the way RFK slowly built her character. You only read about her from June's perpective when she's already dead and still she comes through as the main character, not less because June is literally obsessed with her. Well-written toxic friendships are my bread and butter and the one in here was one of my favorites. The way it was dealt with: nothing less of spectacular. I found June's morality to be the most interesting aspect of this book, but the relationship between her and Athena comes in second for sure.Much care went into the secondary characters too.Even when they only fully appeared once or twice, they always had a well-rounded story behind them.I can apply that specifically to the publishing team and Geoff. From that last one it's again apparent and so on-the-nose how me and RFK's morally grey characters just work together. What can I say? I'm fascinated with them. Geoff reminded me of so many white male authors on twitter but he just had a pull. I loved that he was so pathetic, that I never knew what he was going to do and then, when I least expected it and as naturally as possible, he showed a completely different side to himself.There are a couple of things I didn't completely enjoy, mainly the pop culture references (way too many, half of them were necessary, the others not so much), and the ending.Overall the ending itself wasn't bad, I loved how it wrapped up, but that final showdown bordered on cartoonish and because of that it was hard to take it seriously. I also feel like the final chapter is missing, although I understand what this novel is actually supposed to be (have I said meta already?).In conclusion, an amazing foray into general fiction by R.F. Kuang. I swear this woman can do no wrong. Give her whatever topic to write about and I bet she can create something incredible out of the most boring premise.I think it's impressive how she took these modern controversies and wrote them into a twisty unputdownable story.It seems to me like it's a new experiment from her but at the same time a really smart jab at publishing too.I wouldn't say it's a perfect book and I'm unsure if I would reread it likeThe Poppy Wartrilogy; however I can't exclude it won't live in my mind rent free as I still catch myself heavily thinking about it.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Oh, Booktwitter, Bookstagram! You lied.This wasn\'t v. good.Yellowface is about June Heyward who steals a manuscript from her best-selling author frenemy. After her friend dies in a bizarre accident, June polishes up the prose and sells the book as her own without crediting her friend.Most of the book is just internal angst about Twitter.Maybe I am not the key demographic for this book (I\'m in the over 35 crowd), but how I approach social media is like Marie Kondo - if it doesn\'t spark joy, I get rid of it. If people spew hate, I just block them.So I don\'t really feel like we were making progress in this novel because I would not have given any credence to these naysayers.There is some commentary on the book community. Some of it was interesting.I will clarify a few things.If you write a negative review, you are not supposed to tag the author.While the internet may seem like The Wild West, GoodReads does have Community Guidelines. They state, ""Criticizing the opinions of others is permitted, but attacking individuals for their opinions is not.""Personally, I have never had a problem with an author, publisher, or GoodReads so you can write negative reviews (just make sure not to violate the Community Guidelines).This book does bring up some interesting points around who gets to tell certain stories and plagiarism.I found this issue of plagiarism particularly ironic because Yellowface didn\'t strike me as very original, essentially a mashup ofThe Plot by Jean Hanoff KorelitzandThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L Frank Baum. Furthermore, RF Kuang had a scene inThe Poppy War (published 2018)where the main character was training by carrying a pig up a mountain.Well, there is a story inHoles (published 1998)by Louis Sachar where someone carries a pig up a mountain.However, people create retellings all the time. There are lots of familiar and time-tested tropes and plots. At what point is it plagiarism? This would have been a great book for a book club.Overall, this was an average book, definitely not the riveting book, have to read in one sitting book that the world has lost its mind over.2025 Reading ScheduleJan\tA Town Like AliceFeb\tBirdsongMar\tCaptain Corelli\'s Mandolin - Louis De BerniereApr\tWar and PeaceMay\tThe Woman in WhiteJun\tAtonementJul\tThe Shadow of the WindAug\tJude the ObscureSep\tUlyssesOct\tVanity FairNov\tA Fine BalanceDec\tGerminalConnect With Me!BlogTwitterBookTubeInstaMy Bookstore at Pango'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""probably the only one of my most anticipated books of 2023 to live up to the hype.this was brilliant, insightful, uncomfortable, and sure maybe a little self-inserty. but authors, especially good authors, have every right to infuse themselves into their stories. i'd much rather read a book that feels cathartic for an author to write, with true depth of emotion, than something devoid of the author's passion.there were parts of this i didn't love. namely the pacing and the ending of the book. but the cutting satire and painfully accurate characterization shone through. i think members of the book community should read this. it helped me recognize some uncomfy truths and hey, only the best books do.""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Madelein L\'Engle said, ""You have to write the book that wants to be written.

If Rebbeca Kuang saw this quote, she must have mixed it up because she wrote this book as though it\'s meant for children who want to graduate to adult fiction.Yellowface is an unsubtle, hammer-to-the-forehead quasi-treatise about the dangers of White Women. Those villainised hacks who never see how what they\'re doing is wrong. They\'re Karens, but they voted for Biden. No really, June Hayward says she is a Democrat, and liberal, and voted for Biden multiple times within the book. Hayward a mediocre author who is friends (and we\'re not really convinced why) with a Chinese American literary star Athena Liu who dies suddenly after a pancake goes down the wrong hole, and Hayward is too inept to perform the Heimlich manoeuvre.After this, Hayward steals Liu\'s manuscript about Chinese laborers forcefully conscripted by the French during World War 1. The caucasity is unsurprising, trite, and racist covering all the beats we experienced every time we covered Discourse about films like The Blindside, Hidden Figures Greenbook, and books like The Help, or American Dirt.This book is not funny, it\'s not particularly well-written, with a literal typo in the first few pagesThe editor who did got fired,. The narrative is repetitive and disjointed, like puzzle pieces forced together from different boxes. There were scenes where June\'s narration is simply exhausting.I have to remind Athena this every single time. She has a goldfish‚Äôs memory when it comes to my problems‚Äîit takes two or three repetitions for anything to stick.First of all, Rebecca, goldfish don\'t have short memories. Some can keep them for years. Secondly, you already said this multiple times. We aren\'t ""goldfish"", we aren\'t sieves. We don\'t need incessant spoonfeeding about something you already said. In the opening stints, June mentions how her debut was left to languish by her editor at the pathetic imprint that was the only one that gave her a chance. It didn\'t need to be repeated. It also speaks to a certain lack of, perhaps, awareness by Rebecca about how publishing classifies books. When they acquire a manuscript, the books are then delineated, and different budgets are assigned to the books based on what they think will be most profitable. In the current environment, poorly written horny romantasy, AI and climate change scare stories, American POC history and struggle porn, badly written romance, and whatever book Booktok bestows its benevolent virality are the ones most likely to get publishing buzz.Majority of the authors are very white, very North American, or very British. June\'s lack of awareness of how publishing works spoke more to Rebecca\'s ignorance or laziness. And ultimately, her scapegoating of publishing ""wanting diverse stories"" rings hollow. Maybe this story would have been better if June had whitewashed a literary navel-gazing story about vulnerability and identity.Beyond the amateurish prose that suffered from sudden bursts of Thesaurus-itis, for example, on Pg. 6 Rebecca writes,It‚Äôs so fucking arbitrary. Or perhaps not arbitrary, but it hinges on factors that have nothing to do with the strength of one‚Äôs prose.then on Pg. 102Can\'t we all get behind decrying antimiscegenation?June also says Athena\'s prose is repetitive while her monologues feel like a scratched CD. One could argue that Rebecca is trying to show how June is unaware of her lack of talent but you can\'t help but wonder if she is just a serviceable writer. The book takes pains to be accessible for mass audiences. Rebecca also wants to explain every little detail such as ARCs and sensitivity readers-jargon everyone who is involved in The Community would know. June even goes on a diatribe when discussing a potential movie deal and says,Accessibility matters.and when undressing the stolen manuscript that\'s ""difficult"" to read, she says,It‚Äôs distracting from the central narrative. Reading should be an enjoyable experience, not a chore.Is this satire or Rebecca explaining why the prose is so bland and repetitive.My suspension of disbelief was unwilling and abused by how ridiculous some of the events in publishing happen. When June mentions the Goodreads Choice Awards more times than more prestigious ones, I couldn\'t help but wonder if Rebecca doesn\'t understand literary Oscars season or if she was trying to pander to Goodreads Choice Awards voters (this book will definitely be listed under Best Fiction). The GCAs are a popularity contest. Rarely do people read all the books listed, they only vote for what they loved. Additionally, no discerning reader who wants a book about Chinese labourers in WW1 would give a fuck about GCAs.Or is this a 4D chess Trojan horse where readers are actually being unwittingly tested as a focus group? Some people will prefer a female friendship story where race dynamics are explored (The Hate U Give), or perhaps they will want a thriller involving authors and books (Too Close To Home by Linwood Barclay), a meta narrative about who gets to tell a story (Bad Art Friend), a serial plagiariser (look up Jumi Bello), or Asian American nonfiction (Minor Feelings) and Rebecca can pick her next project. Maybe Rebecca is staging herself as the host of the round table to discuss whether authors should interact with reviews. But as we saw with Lauren Hough, the answer is still no.There was also a glaring pattern where June kept pointing out Athena\'s flaws. How she was once the actual bad art friend, how Twitter Hot Take enthusiasts called her a race traitor. But we never get to delve into that because June believesno one is that deep into Chinese history or politics. Great job, Rebecca. You have shut down your critics for the lack of nuance in Asian history and characters in Babel. Athena is so offensively superficially written that I almost wished we had gotten her point of view, as a villain who wants to step on all faces to the top of the literary throne. The few snippets we get of her prose show she\'s a much better writer than June and her narration would have been more palatable than June\'s weapons of mass boredom.There\'s a certain Discourse we\'re supposed to have from this book about Bad White Women, and how publishing serves to silence writers of colour. We also have to discuss who gets to tell certain stories. The problem is, we have spoken about this ad nauseum. So who is this book for? Outsiders who would like to know how it works? Adults who wanted a meta vivisection of this insular world but with Dark Themes?Rebecca doesn\'t know. She says it\'s a thriller examining the idiosyncracies of publishing. It\'s not thrilling. And it has a myopic view of how publishing works. About good intentions that went poorly when June always set out to usurp Athena\'s work from the jump? It\'s not satire. It\'s a reverse K√ºnstlerroman. Why is it necessary? The book doesn\'t tell you because it ends like a flaccid plateau.

As ambiguous as Scarlett Johansson\'s Japanese-ness. And Emma Stone\'s Vietnamese-ness.June is asked to speak on panels, go to book clubs, and mentor student writers. When the aforementioned people learn she is not Chinese, heads begin to roll. June does not take this in stride. She thinks she is entitled to write Chinese stories, because she ""did research.""

I thought it was very inappropriate how the author used an objectively bitchy and untrustworthy narrator as a mouthpiece for all of the REAL LIFE criticisms that the actual author has received in real life. By doing this, all of the critiques seem like they come from people who are just jealous and have no valid arguments against her self-insert martyr author character Athena (who mirrors the real life author in many, MANY ways). I read this book one year before it was actually published, so there might have been changes, but from this video and other reviews I\'ve seen, not much is different from when I first read it.I will be honest up front: this review is entirely plagiarized.Was I not meant to admit that? Should I have, instead, gone on long, rambling, and yet tersely flat paragraphs about how ironic it is that I am negatively critiquing a book about plagiarism by using the same points as everyone else? Should I call this satire‚Äîgranted that there is nothing humorous and that I am not particularly strongly exaggerating anything‚Äîas I amateurly write prose so unabashedly written in my own voice that it would be impossible to separate any idea from my own? Because that appears to be the direction this book has gone in.I am not the first to say that this reads like RFK\'s notes app consciousness, nor will I be the last. While I will not get into specifics, as this is an incredibly early copy of the book, I will say that anyone who even remotely knows anything about the author will see the similarities between them and...certain things. Now, I have no issue with an author writing from experience.\'Write what you know\'is both an incredibly popular and successful piece of advice given to wannabee-writers. Butfuck,at some point one has to wonder about the motivation behind it.Simply put, because there is no other way to put it, this book felt like a circle-jerk. I should have expected such a thing from a satire on the publishing industry written by a prominent figure within it. It is typical‚Äîof course they will ridicule things like social media and how the masses view them. Of course they will glower at criticisms and mock fellow authors. Is that not the purpose of satire? But this feels like so much more than that. Instead, I feel as if RFK is speaking to me in a jest. Like she is pointing toward the book community, head cocked to the side, cheekily winking in our shared knowledge of their ridiculousness. Her eyes say,look at them‚Äîlook at their silliness and their worries and their jealousy. See how they behave like animals, that group of people outside of our circle.Like she\'ll laugh right after, content in her knowledge that she lives in an absurd space, and that only we understand its absurdity.My first tip-off‚Äîno, not my first, though perhaps the most obscene‚Äîis how she uses our untrustworthy protagonist. RFK is, without a doubt, excellent at writing bad people. I have never argued against this, and I rather think I never will. But in this way, I feel almost uncomfortable when her unlikable characters serve the role of real people. She mocks criticism she has received in the past for her very real, non-fictitious books, through these characters. It feels, once again, like a terrible inside joke I have been privy to. As if the reader is meant to read these and think,these ridiculous characters! To say such things as this!And yet when one is aware of the author\'s actual past, it becomes...awkward. That is, she is not an author of subtlety. The satire could not work because it was not sufficiently...anything! I did not find it funny, nor was it so exaggerated as to be comical.The writing in general did not work for me.Babel,for all of its long-winded sentences and unending paragraphs of description, felt like a declaration of loyalty to words. This book, instead, felt like it was made by someone who could not care less for such things. This is, I understand, literary fiction. RFK has gone out of her normal bubble of fantasy to try something new, and I truly commend her for it. But I must question if this is the right genre for her. She is blunt and uncouth, neither of which are particularly bad‚Äînor do I even dislike it‚Äîbut which are painfully obvious throughout this. I felt like I was reading one of those High School creative writing class exercises (something which I actually do on a daily basis) where the young, inexperienced creator feels the need to say things like ""but you\'ll never guess what happens next"" and ""this is something that\'ll come up later"" in their first point of view narrative as if the reader is not skillful enough to gradually realize such things later on. Its modernist setting equally paid a part in this. There are only so many times you can name-drop an author or celebrity or, God-be-damned, fucking Harry Potter before realizing you have written something that reads like a Buzzfeed quiz. No, the narration did not work for me, nor did I think that any of it ultimately paid off in its strange and wholly random ending I can only describe as, ""really?""I struggle to find the words to end this. I\'m afraid I have run out of other people\'s thoughts to steal as I reword them into my own. I want to clarify that I do like the author\'s other works. Out of the five books of hers I\'ve read (all of her works except for that one anthology she worked on), I\'ve really liked and sometimes loved three of them. But that doesn\'t mean I\'m not capable of thinking that this was not her best genre, nor her best work by any means. This book felt like the worst possible self-awareness. The type shared over grins and knowing smiles, wherein both parties are partaking in the mockery of a group of people they think themselves entirely separated from. This is a book that both ridicules authors while falling to its knees, proclaiming its undying devotion to them. Funny enough, I praisedBabelfor a much similar sentiment. But where in that book I enjoyed the constant switch between criticizing the power and history of words to being mesmerized over them,Yellowfacefelt more like a sledgehammer.Love me,it sayslike I love you‚Äîall of us‚Äîthe sophisticated and knowledgeable professionals.

For maybe the first fifty pages or so the writing felt a bit dry, though when the plot picks up, I found myself so curious to know: will this white woman who stole an Asian American woman‚Äôs work get caught?? Will she confront her own insecurities that led to this? Is Athena actually dead?? R.F. Kuang creates a selfish, self-absorbed main character in June Hayward, with a consistent voice that kept me engaged inYellowface‚Äôs story.I also think this book does open up important conversations. Yes, at times it makes its point bluntly/crudely and in an obvious way, though through this satire Kuang raises deeper questions too, such as whether anyone can remain truly ethical or generous in a brutally capitalist publishing industry. I liked how Kuang didn‚Äôt make Athena a perfect character because by doing so, she highlights how people of color can engage in problematic and oppressive practices too.So even though I didn‚Äôt agree with all of Kuang‚Äôs satirical commentary inYellowface(e.g., I think Asian Americans should be asked hard, critical questions about glorifying whiteness both in dating partners and in other areas of life), I respect that she seized a popular topic in the publishing industry and made a novel out of it. The exaggerated nature of satire doesn‚Äôt always lend itself to a deeper emotional connection with the characters or the story, though I don‚Äôt think a deep emotional connection is necessarily the point of this novel. Overall, while I don‚Äôt see this novel breaking into my top ten list at the end of this year, I found it an interesting read and one that may be fun to discuss.*also, just to add, this type of thing is still happening all the time, including in other industries. Recently I saw a white woman publish a research paper on Black and Latinx mothers and when I emailed her and asked about her research practices with these communities, she literally just ignored me. And, as I\'ve written about in at least one other review, one time I gently called in a white woman for doing her dissertation on Asian American women (with no Asian American women as coauthors) and she called me aggressive and ""untrusting."" sigh!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '‚ÄùWho has the right to write about suffering?‚ÄùHave you ever read a book that is so timely and effective in its message that you do not feel the slightest bit qualified to review it?

It takes a genius to achieve that.She explored every possible aspect or every question you might have, every side you could possibly take on this subject, doesn't leave much room for the reviewer, but I'm not complaining (I like my thoughts planted)PLOT The blurb is short and easy to understand, so i don't feel the need to retell it once more (I know I would do a poor job). I saw that most reviews on here surrounded the issues of the publishing industry as the central theme of this book, but I wouldn't agree. Just like with Babel, the racial debate takes the biggest piece of the cake, just dressed in different icing. But again, I'm not complaining. The book community is rarely not problematic, let's be honest, we are witnessing whitewashing and white supremacy on here every day.

AndElainjust floats around and lets things happen to her.Morrigan, never all that interesting, now just represents the worst bisexuality rep I‚Äôve ever read.It‚Äôs never a good sign when you‚Äôre praying for characters to die in battle just so you can catch a f*cking break.But guess what. None of them do.THE WRITING SUCKS, ON BOTH A COPYEDITING LEVEL AND A SUBSTANTIVE LEVELI truly believe that whatever team of sad sacks was assigned to copyedit this book was physically unable to attentively read it. And I cannot blame them. But it does allow for some hilarious mistakes to make it through these dull, dull pages.Example: ‚ÄúShe did not avert her eyes from the Morrigan.‚Äù That pesky ‚Äúthe‚Äù makes her seem like a pro wrestler, or someone with a fun nickname, rather than the personification of the worst bi rep ever to grace young adult pages. But we‚Äôll get to that.There are so many ellipses and dashes and italicizations and...other - ways: ofbreakingup the TEXT that it actually gave me motion sickness. On top of everything else this book has made me suffer through.Maybe if a copyeditor had found the strength to make it through this book, they could have stopped the way SJM insists on using the term ‚ÄúHybern.‚Äù IT MEANS SO MANY THINGS. ‚ÄúHybern‚Äù is used as the nomer of the evil king, the word for his people, the name of his kingdom, and the title of the land it‚Äôs situated on. That is just...basic bad worldbuilding, no?Also, a monster creature thing described as having no eyelids narrows its eyes. This inspired a fifteen minute long discussion with my roommates on whether eyes can narrow without eyelids. We came to a unanimous consensus: no, they cannot.Also, asValpointed out in her amazing review of this book, the words ‚Äúvulgar gesture‚Äù are used over. And over. And over again. WHAT DO THESE USES MEAN. WHY DO THEY CONSTANTLY INSPIRE LAUGHTER IN WHATEVERGLORIFIED PROPCHARACTER WHO HAPPENS TO BE NEARBY. IS THIS TACTIC SUPPOSED TO REPLACE ACTUAL JOKES OR BANTER? Because it doesn‚Äôt. It just makes me angry, and also confused, which makes meeven angrier.And who thought that was even possible.WHAT IS THIS ATTEMPT AT HIGH FANTASY LANGUAGEExcept then, y‚Äôknow, Rhys and Feyre and the Gang are also so hip and cool and up to date that this book uses the word ‚Äúfuckable,‚Äù a word so slang-y that my laptop recognizes it as a typo for ‚Äúsuckable‚Äù or ‚Äúfaceable,‚Äù whatever the hell those words are.Otherwise, the only other remarkable attempt at making this any different from the way humans speak in 2017: the use of the word ‚Äúmale.‚ÄùWomen are sometimes called ‚Äúfemales‚Äù in this, but are also called women and girls and whatnot. Men, on the other hand, are absolutely only called males. There‚Äôs an amazing moment when SJM refers to Rhys as a man, and then instantly, like, corrects herself. So it reads on the page as ‚Äúman - male -‚ÄùIt makes no sense. I love it.It‚Äôs truly the little things.THE END OF THIS BOOK IS JUST A LISTING OF CLICHESAs the war we‚Äôve waited for finally arrives, and so does the time for motivational speeches and tragic goodbyes and other things that fail to make me feel something, SJM loses it entirely.Nearly every line of dialogue in this section is just a clich√©, and so I will copy and paste them here, for your perusal and accompanying amusement.‚ÄúLeave this world‚Ä¶a better place than how you found it.‚Äù‚ÄúOne life may change the world.‚Äù‚ÄúI believe everything happens for a reason.‚Äù‚ÄúIt is the family you make, not the one you are born into, that matters.‚Äù‚ÄúLight can be found even in the darkest of hells.‚Äù‚ÄúThe great joy and honor of my life has been to know you.‚Äù‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt sure if in the entire history of Illyria, there had ever been such a discussion.‚ÄùSo bad. And, therefore, so good.LET‚ÄôS LAUGH AT DUMB THINGSThe moments when this may or may not be attempting to instill some sort of entertainment or amusement in its reader do not work at all. Luckily, we have something much better: Really dumb stuff. It is much more fun (and nourishing to the very soul, like a bowl of chicken soup - so pretty much the series of books ‚ÄúChicken Soup for the Soul‚Äù) to laugh at something unintentional and dumb than it is to laugh at a cheap joke. This is why the show America‚Äôs Funniest Home Videos has been on for twenty-eight seasons, and like a thousand interchangeable bad sitcoms are canceled every year.For example, this passage. Feyre and Rhysand are apart, blah blah blah, it‚Äôs the tragedy of the century (or millennium, since these boring ass people live for infinity, because there is no justice in this world). Unsurprisingly, they use their mind control powers for a saintly motivation: sexting. Which is already so hilarious. But it gets even better, because:‚ÄúI sent back an image of me sticking out my tongue at him.My clothes were back on when his answer arrived.Like mine, it was wordless, a mere image. Like mine, Rhysand‚Äôs tongue was out.But it was occupied with doing something else.‚ÄùI choose to interpret this statement the same way a middle schooler interprets the existence of performer Marilyn Manson based on a shady rumor he once heard about a surgery to remove three ribs. I believe that this is incontrovertible evidence that Rhysand can suck his own d*ck. WHAT ELSE COULD HE POSSIBLY BE DOING. WHAT COULD IT POSSIBLY BE OCCUPIED WITH. SJM I JUST WANNA TALK.But just as often as I was making myself laugh by making Rhys my YA fantasy version of Marilyn Manson, I was being equally amused by seemingly innocuous lines. Like when Eris, scary villain/abuser extraordinaire, was bidding The Night Gang adieu and said, ‚ÄúSee you at the meeting in twelve days.‚Äù I MEAN. WHAT. WHO SPEAKS LIKE THAT. Even dialogue is just an opportunity to force an info dump. You guys, seriously: this book isso poorly written.LET‚ÄôS SCREAM ABOUT DUMB THINGSSometimes, or most of the time depending on how you look at it, I do not want to laugh at the dumb things. Sometimes I am incapable of it, because this book is an ungodly length and so much of it is long-term stupidity.Chapter 45, for example. Or, as I like to call it, ‚ÄúThat Meeting in Twelve Days Finally Happens.‚Äù Yes, this book is so boring that we are expected to anticipate an actual, literal meeting. Sure, it‚Äôs a meeting between high lords to talk about war, but it‚Äôs still a sit-down political discussion. And also it‚Äôs just the same endless repetitive cycle of insult dialogue feat. fun moments of The Night Gang being the least convincing people on the entirety of the Earth.There‚Äôs an especially great moment in that adrenaline-inducing conference. For the 800 pages leading up to it, Rhys is all,‚ÄúOk, Feyre. Listen up. Number one thing - just don‚Äôt show your powers, k? Long story short the Powerful Men are going to get pissy and then‚Ä¶well y‚Äôknow these negotiations are the most important thing to happen in hundreds of years, which I should know because I‚Äôve been alive for that long, even though you‚Äôre, what, fresh outta adolescence? Anyway just the only thing you should do is not show your powers.‚ÄùTo which Feyre‚Äôs response is,‚ÄúGot it. *shows powers instantly*‚ÄùYES. Feyre shows her powers at the meeting!! So quickly!!! She doesn‚Äôt even try all that hard, and, as promised, it almost derails the nonstop excitement of this much-anticipated civilized forum! Almost. Except then everything works out, as it always does, by Feyre saying something totally normal, 6/10 at best, and everyone being like ‚Äúwow omg...who is this girl...she is so smart and brave and honest and we respect her so much‚Äù so that Rhys can be like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs my mate lol.‚ÄùIRRELEVANT COMPLAININGThe only way to make the experience of reading a deeply unpleasant, extremely long book worse is to publish that book with goddamn tissue paper pages. This was like reading the Bible but without the action. And with a whole lot more smut.I‚Äôm tucking this quote in this section too, because I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being persnickety, but at one point, it‚Äôs said that‚ÄúOnly a madman would wield the might of his army just to get revenge on three women.‚ÄùAnd my question is, why use the word ‚Äúwomen‚Äù? Why not ‚Äúpeople‚Äù? Is it more insane if it‚Äôs women? Why is that? TELL ME WHY. REALLY I JUST WANNA TALK.PLOTLINE? WHAT PLOTLINEThis book is just...so boring.There are countless info dumps, which, I mean. There‚Äôs no excuse for that in a third book. This was going to be the last book in the series, when there was still hope in the world and I prayed that somehow SJM actually was writing these books for some sort of artistic fulfillment rather than money. How, I ask you, would there still be so much sh*tty worldbuilding in the last book in a series?OH YES, THIS BOOK IS DEFINITELY WOKE AND NOT THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF THAT ENTIRELYSJM has been getting a lot of sh*t lately for her white/straight/cis narratives. So it‚Äôs no surprise that she would try to get those pesky activists off her back this time. Unfortunately, she does a remarkably bad job.This book is all straight people except for LGBT+ relationships based on sex alone, or in an unequal relationship wherein one person has authority over another. (Examples: a high lord whose bisexuality extends purely to the fact that he‚Äôs into threesomes; a military captain dating his high lord/commander/boss.)Plus, there‚Äôs bisexuality rep so terrible it took me hours to make it through a handful of pages. But that gets a category of its own.I also shouldn‚Äôt be surprised at the redemption of abusers in this book. Because Tamlin, in ACOTAR, was just a Nice Guy. Fine. But the fangirls loved a certain bad boy guest star with purple eyes. So, instead of creating a love triangle or transitioning between love interests like a normal person, SJM made him into an actual abuser. A villain.That‚Äôs also fine. But you can‚Äôt just redeem him like you could redeem the unloved side of a love triangle. Because you made him into a genuinely bad person.Unfortunately, SJM must have missed that memo. She must have missed it three times, actually, because Eris also gets redemption (and a throne!). As does his enabler brother, Lucien. Wonderful. Abuse apologists for the win.But this book is totally, definitely feminist, right??? I mean, female protagonist! War plotline! It must be, by default! So when Cassian says‚ÄúI told you that the moment we started letting females into our group, they‚Äôd be nothing but trouble‚Äù, and woke king Rhys responds,‚ÄúYou actually said you needed a reprieve from staring at our ugly faces, and that someladieswould add some much needed prettiness for you to look at all day.‚Äùit‚Äôs totally fine!So it‚Äôs an utter shock that this narrative also lives nearly entirely within the bounds of gender roles. Reading about men (Rhys, Cassian, Azriel, all the high lords) fighting in battle while the women (Feyre, Mor, Elain, Nesta, Cresseida) watch and tend to the wounded later is sorefreshing. Doesn‚Äôt make me want to blow my brains out at all.And no, Mor being assigned to babysit Feyre later on, only heading into battle because Feyre tricks her into fighting so she can sneak away does not make it better, thanks.This is definitely, certainly the feminist YA fantasy you‚Äôve been waiting for, folks.THE WORST BI REP EVER TO HIT THE SHELVES, WHICH IS INSANE BECAUSE WHEN IS THERE E V E R GOOD BI REPBut I haven‚Äôt mentioned the most unforgivable thing yet. The thing that made this book my first SJM one-star, after giving every other book I‚Äôve read by her two stars. The thing that actually made me feel real hatred and fury and, worst of all, sadness.Truly, the worst bisexual representation I have ever read comes in the final chapters of this book. I‚Äôve read a lot of bad bisexual rep. And it‚Äôs endlessly upsetting. But none of it felt quite like this.Apparently, Sarah J. Maas decided in the third book that she wanted to stop getting sh*t for her heteronormativity. So she decided to take a character who had been established as straight, and make her bi.So she took this character, Morrigan. She makes Morrigan cry. She writes Morrigan‚Äôs impassioned speech to Feyre. This is Morrigan‚Äôs coming out, for the first time. Morrigan says that she prefers women. To the point that she is only capable of feeling romantic love for a women.But occasionally, she will force herself to sleep with a man. In order ‚Äúto keep people from looking too closely.‚Äù Instead of telling the man who has been in love with her for centuries that she doesn‚Äôt love him back, won‚Äôt ever love him back, she forces herself to sleep with men when he‚Äôll know that she‚Äôs done it, so that she still seems straight but he‚Äôll know she doesn‚Äôt love him.And the author dubs it bisexuality.I hate that she felt entitled to use this underrepresented, misunderstood sexuality as a playing piece in her own quest to be well-liked. I hate that the hundreds of thousands of people who read this book have been given this depiction of bisexuality. And I hate that Sarah J. Maas will keep writing wildly successful books. Books in this very series, depicting this character in this way and calling it ‚Äúbisexuality.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs unfair. It‚Äôs awful. And I am never, never, never going to forget that it happened.Bottom line: I didn‚Äôt expect to like this book. But I also didn‚Äôt expect it would become one of my least favorite books I‚Äôve ever read.----pre-reviewI did it.Everyone told me I couldn't do it.Just DNF it,they said.You're being insane,they said.Why would you force yourself through 700 pages of misery?

No, I don‚Äôt. Good kids.‚ÄúYou High Lords really do love your melodrama, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù(As if I hadn\'t got enough ammo already.)For honesty\'s sake, the last two thirds of the book I could only bring myself to skim through (and I\'m quite proud of myself for managing even that). The first third had accurately enlightened me as to what I was to expect, and my (abysmally low) expectations were met point by point.We girls of the SmutClub weren\'t able to do a proper buddy read as we did last year with ACoMaF due to real life kicking our asses. However, I\'m sure you don\'t want to missSarah\'sandReyes\'sreviews, andEmer\'scall for honesty and good sense when it comes tothe target market of this series(and of theThrone of Glassseries too, at this point) perfectly highlights a problem I haven\'t been able to wrap my mind around since it first arose.‚Ä¢First of all, I\'d like to take a moment to answer a question that no one asked but that I think it fair to take into account nonetheless, said question being, ""If you evidently don\'t like Maas\'s books, why do you keep reading them?""Very good point indeed.I used to consider her books a guilty pleasureuntil, well, yesterday. The word ""pleasure"" in that expression, though, baffled me very much even before. More correctly, reading her was an experience akin to getting your first period at school and noticing too late (mortallyembarrassing), while ranting about it later was an honest if inclement exercise in snark, just as reading other people\'s reviews with previous knowledge of the book was pure amusement, be them positive or negative, and this latter reason is probably what always convinced me to suffer a little for the greater fun. Sometimes I also enjoyed some parts, so mine wasn\'t all sadism, after all. ButA Court of Wings and Ruin? (I still have no clue about what this absurd title is supposed to mean.) This one wassheer torture.A bore. Like havinga pitchfork repeatedly shoved in the eyeballs.(I should refer you tomy review ofA Court of Mist and Fury, which already contains many, if not all, of the issues I had with this final installment too, because since I\'ve read that book with way more attention than I did ACoWaR, you\'d probably find that one more specific and generally accurate.)‚Ä¢The writing gets worse. It\'s a miracle -or whatever its opposite would be called. Saying that it\'smelodramaticdoesn\'t begin to describe it anymore; admitting that its basic rule isemotional manipulationwould be such an understatement, my fingers itch. Everything is amplified, everything is exaggerated, everything makes twice the noise that it should make proportionally to its dimensions. Which is to say,everything becomes grotesque.Ridiculousness abounds, especially when matters of the heart (you haveno ideahow much I struggled not to use some other word that would have been more fit to the case at hand there) are concerned. I\'ll make just two quick examples both taken from chapter 14.The examples may contain mild spoilers.‚ÄúWhere are my sisters?‚Äù The thought clanged through me, jarring as a pealing bell.Rhys paused, hand slipping from my hair as his smile faded. ‚ÄúAt the House of Wind.‚Äù He straightened, swallowing‚Äîas if it somehow checked him. ‚ÄúI can‚Äîtake you to them.‚Äù Every word seemed to be an effort.But he would, I realized. He‚Äôd shove down his need for me and take me to them, if that was what I wanted. My choice.It had always been my choice with him.‚ÄùTo spell it out, what Feyre\'s voice is implying here is that one point in the never-ending list of reasons why Rhysand is worth worshipping is that he is able to keep it in his pants ten minutes longer so that she can go say hello to her sisters, whom she hasn\'t seen in more than a month and who, last she saw them, had just undergone a devastating trauma. It is evident that Maas isstillshoving in our faces that wemustabsolutely love Rhysand... a pity she isstillpicking all the wrong reasons, because what I think when I read a scene like this is ""Someone please lock him away"" (and I\'m being kind).Example number two(trigger warning: this one\'s rather disgusting. I for sure gagged once or twice.), this oneto show what I mean by ""overwritten"" and ""grotesque"" and ""ew"":‚ÄúYou have a choice,‚Äù he murmured against my cheekbone. ‚ÄúEither I lick every inch of you clean ‚Ä¶‚Äù His hand grazed the tip of my breast, circling lazily. As if we had days and days to do this. ‚ÄúOr you can get into the bath that should be ready by now.‚ÄùI pulled away, lifting a brow. ‚ÄúAre you suggesting that I smell?‚ÄùRhys smirked, and I could have sworn my core pounded in answer. ‚ÄúNever. But ‚Ä¶‚Äù His eyes darkened, the desire and amusement fading as he took in my clothes.‚ÄúThere is blood on you. Yours, and others‚Äô. I thought I‚Äôd be a good mate and offer you a bath before I ravish you wholly.‚ÄùI huffed a laugh and brushed back his hair, savoring the silken, sable strands between my fingers. ‚ÄúSo considerate. ThoughI can‚Äôt believe you kicked everyone out of the house so you could take me to bed.‚Äù‚ÄúOne of the many benefits to being High Lord.‚Äù‚ÄúWhat a terrible abuse of power.‚ÄùThat half smile danced on his mouth. ‚ÄúWell?‚Äù‚ÄúAs much as I‚Äôd like to see you attempt to lick off a week‚Äôs worth of dirt, sweat, and blood‚Ä¶‚ÄùHis eyes gleamed with the challenge, and I laughed again. ‚ÄúNormal bath, please.‚ÄùYou see what I mean? Maas triesso hardto write steamy, sexy moments that she stopped noticing that the way she writes them became (a long time ago I dare say)utterly ridiculous. What sane person in their right mind would ever say ""I‚Äôd like to see you attempt to lick off a week‚Äôs worth of dirt, sweat, and blood off me?""Many, many,many, if not all, of the problems this book has are linked to the writing,silly,childish,bloated,cheesy. It sourseverything.‚Ä¢Not totally disconnected from this, there is also the insistence with whichFeyre\'s bliss with her Court of Friends and Familyis continually trotted out, especially if there\'s the opportunity to describe it through someone else\'s point of view, as it happens with Lucien\'s in the first part of the book.There is a reason if one of the axioms of storytelling is that talking about happiness is difficult: it\'s uninteresting, poor of nuances, syrupy: people don\'t want to hear about happiness. ‚ÄúHappy families are all alike,‚Äù after all.‚Ä¢One of the main points ofFeyre\'s character arcshould be her discovery of independence and of her inner strength, of the fact that she doesn\'t necessarily need anyone, especially a man, to guide and direct her every step. A shame the impression we get from the whole series isthe very opposite: Feyre\'s character growth (not automatically meant as an upward trajectory) seems to be irreversiblyconnected to the ""male"" who is (even virtually) at her side. In this book, she and Rhysand are pretty much a single entity. Can I feel a tinge of outrage at this, please? We women are very able to be complete on our own, thank you very much. The whole""mating system"" (I can\'t even, it\'s too ridiculous)has me not exactly convinced in this regard too. Various characters throughout the book keep having this attitude, especially towards Feyre, that impliesa vision of women as mere objects of sexual interest, pawns in a purely male game of lust and authority, and they are never challenged because their brain is full of crap, but simply because they insult Feyre‚Äìand not even Feyre as herself, but Feyre as Rhysand\'s mate, like during the meeting of the High Lords in chapter 46, when someone calls Feyre ""human filth"" and Rhysand\'s reply is physical violence plus a laconic‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever,‚Äù Rhys said, hands sliding into his pockets, ‚Äúspeak tomy matelike that again.‚ÄùAgain, everything, even on the level of language, revolves around a man and the girl\'s relationship to said man. I fail to see the women\'s empowerment in this.‚Ä¢I\'ve never seensuch a cheesy ending. It feltlike I had just swallowed a monumental bucket of melted sugarand I couldn\'t even breathe because the very air got stuck to the sticky back of my throat. Basically it made me finally understand that Maas\'s main interest was to make sure none of her precious babies got so much as a scratch.‚ûΩ I was trying to find a way to be tactful and diplomatic about this, but there is none. The first book was nice and very entertaining, the second was still entertaining but way less nice,the third is ignoble. Bottom line:this series is crap.Don\'t read it(and if you know me and my reviews, you know Ineveronce recommendednotto read a book, nor do I think I shall ever do it again, because the fact that I don\'t like something doesn\'t mean that nobody would or should. Besides, I don\'t really believe in second-hand opinions. So the fact that I think this book will actively damage your brains and that I\'m warning you off it should really speak volumes in itself). There are far more worthy books out there waiting for you.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '3.75 stars""Rhys stepped off the stairs and took my hand.Night Triumphant‚Äîand the Stars Eternal.If he was the sweet, terrifying darkness, I was the glittering light that only his shadows could make clear.""It\'s the worst feeling in the world when finales don\'t match up to their predecessors.I likedA Court of Thorns and Roses, IlovedA Court of Mist and Fury, I am frankly disappointed byA Court of Wings and Ruin.First, the writing.It\'s in desperate need of another round of editing. It\'s unpolished, full of unnecessary repetition and lazy placeholder sentences.Maascanwrite. She\'s proved it over and over again, which makes ACOWAR seem almost criminal. I think the strain of writing two novels a year finally caught up with her. ACOTAR AND ACOMAF don\'t really count because they were written long beforeThrone of Glasswas published. All she had to do was clean up. But ACOWAR was written back-to-back withEmpire of Storms, which was a beefy number on its own.Fervent as I was for ACOWAR, I wouldn\'t have minded waiting another year if it meant getting quality content.Second is the ending.Rhys lives, Amren lives, everybody fucking lives.Where are the sacrifices? How it can possible that no one in this bloated main cast dies? (Don\'t you bloody dare point to Feyre\'s dad. He was barely a presence the entire series, and I remain firmly convinced Maas brought him back just to fill the death toll and shut up people like me.)I understand Rhys\'s resurrection‚Äîhe\'s Feyre\'s mate and fan favorite and therefore too important to die‚Äîbut Amren too? Her losing her godly power is not a sacrifice. She\'s still High Fae. Why not make her human? Why not have a human serve in the Night Court? Or why not have Cassian or someone else lose their wings? Quite a few reviewers (and me included) havementioned this already, but Maas undeniably has an obsession with inhumanly powerful characters.On the subject of Rhys, it would have been so, so cool for Feyre to be the sole ruler of the Night Court. The first High Lady in history. And it would have been a fitting end to her character arc. She was dependent on a man in the first book, was broken by the same man in the second, and then healed and made to see she could be powerful and independent by another man. In the third, she stands alone, back straight, strong and proud, without a man. Obviously I\'m oversimplifying things here, but you can\'t deny the pieces line up.Also, that deus ex machina army in the end. Oh, we\'re on the edge of losing! All is lost! BUT WAIT here\'s an army. And ANOTHER army!Another thing that bothered me is howunbelievably powerful Feyre is.There is feminism, which is an underlying theme for her character, and there is what-the-fuckery. Near the beginning of the book, she is able to take on two daemati (powerful fae) who have a thousand years of fighting experience over her. Later, after she accidentally ingests a drug that strips her of her powers, they still magically flare back to life to help her triumph over two seasoned High Fae fighters.Right, I think I\'ve bitched enough about the bad.Let\'s get to the good.I love the characters.The Inner Circle, Lucien, Nesta, Elain... they are a huge part why I rated ACOWAR as high as it is. Feyre and Rhys‚Äîin this book and this book only‚Äîaren\'t as interesting. Their story in terms of conflict was finished in ACOMAF and although I enjoy how Maas explores how normal couples argue and make up, I\'m not as invested in them as before. There are too many other stories begging to be told: Lucien\'s, Elain\'s, Nesta and Cassian\'s, Mor\'s, Tamlin\'s.Yes, Tamlin. This fandom is too hard on him‚Äîand too forgiving of Rhys. I will never forget what he did in ACOTAR. Yet because the story is filtered through Feyre\'s perspective, Rhys becomes a hero who makes mistakes and Tamlin becomes a monster who commits unforgivable sins. He genuinely thought the woman he loved had been abducted and was likely being tortured. I\'m not excusing his abusive behavior, but we have to remember he was suffering from PTSD too. He was trying to protect Feyre the best he could‚Äîjust like Rhys by forcing Feyre to make that bargain with him way back in ACOTAR, fyi. Why does Rhys deserve dozens of free passes and not Tamlin?Hating the High Lord of Spring just because Feyre does is a disservice to the complexity of his character.I also like that Maas seems to bepulling away from the whole ""mates"" concept.Multiple characters within have strong romantic relationships without the mating bond, and those that do may not necessarily be right for each other.Much as I love the idea of Lucien and Elain, I get the feeling that she\'s setting them up for something different. Elain and Azriel, and Lucien and Vassa.The pacing is good, too.There aren\'t as many sex scenes as the previous book, which I was happy about, though not due to any misguided sense of propriety. I simply found myself bored reading about Rhys slamming his shaft up to the hilt or what not.Still lowkey mad the first thing Feyre did after coming back from the Spring Court is bang Rhys and not check on her traumatized sisters.While I liked them in ACOMAF, there are more important things going on here, like the war or the other courts.Final verdict? Bring on the spin-offs.My review of A Court of Thorns & RosesMy review of A Court of Mist & FuryMy review of A Court of Frost and StarlightMy review of A Court of Silver Flames'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I wish so much that I could tell you I loved this book... but I just didn\'t.After thinkingA Court of Mist and Furywas such a huge improvement fromA Court of Thorns and Roses, I was really excited for this third installment. I even preordered it. But I really struggled to get into the book from the very start. Frompacing issuestoawkward sex scenesthat did nothing for me, it was one disappointment after another.I\'ve said this before but I reallydislike Maas\'s sex scenes. At her best, she writes them strangely with words like ""branding"" and ""claiming"", but here they were just plain icky. With all the talk of ""mates"", ""growling"" and ""purring"", and the climaxing from stroking one another\'s wings, I felt like I\'d walked in on two animals rutting in the mud. Ugh.And another thing-- Feyre and Rhysand are already mated and loved up to their eyeballs so there wasno sexual tension, no will they/won\'t they, which made the sex scenes so boring.What\'s strange about these sex scenes is how they manage to somehow be both graphic and coy at the same time. Maas never actually uses explicit words. If a young kid picked up this book, they might assume Rhysand and Feyre were dancing or playing an instrument.His touch turned different. Exploring. Broad strokes and feather-light ones, arches and swirls and direct, searing lines.And her vagina is usually described as ""there"" or ""where I want him"". Then, at the same time, these scenes are weirdly overwritten, with her orgasm (obviously not called that) leaving her ‚Äúskin glowing like a newborn star in its wake‚Äù. It\'s just really not my thing.I was disappointed with the writing in general, to be honest. Maas seemed to write a lot more ""tell"" and a lot less ""show"" than usual. I was especially disappointed at the wasted opportunity for some underhanded manipulation in the first part. After how the last book ended, Feyre was kind of ""undercover"" at the start and in a position for lies and sneakiness. Except it was mostly her swanning around and quietly seething to herself about how much she hated Ianthe and how much of a douche Tamlin is.I thought this whole part was boring when it should have been extremely tense and exciting.But I think the worst thing was the overall pacing. It\'s a long book, but I can normally sprint through Maas\'s works in a day, yet here it wassuch a slog. Especially the first half. It\'s taken up with a lot of character conversations and strategizing for the upcoming war with Hybern. It lacked a pull, a sense of urgency, some kind of tension to make me need to know what happens next.I cannot believe they\'ve announced anotherfour booksfor this series. Why??? I can only hope they are some kind of spin-off series because, otherwise, either a) we will have to suffer through who the fuck knows how many more awkward, unsexy Feyre/Rhysand sex scenes, or b) Maas will destroy Rhys\'s character and hook Feyre up with yet another hot fae dude. I\'m not sure which is more likely.The later chapters of this book picked up in pacing, but I think it wastoo little, too late. This is a whopping 700-page monster and it obviously didn\'t need to be.

Thank you for letting us dream and travel across the stars if only for a short time.I have been a massive fan of the ACOTAR series since the first book so I was highly anticipating ACOWAR.I was afraid I wouldn‚Äôt like the third book as much as I loved the second one but hell, I was so wrong. I swear, I don't know how many nerve cells this book cost me.Not only is the book thrilling and well-written. But it added a lot more complexity than I'd expected. Both in the characters and the plot.The progression brings aboutso many new faces(Have five to Helion, my second favourite High Lord), each of them unique in their own way.When Feyre was in the Spring Court, she was so over-powered like she is a goodness and no one can stop her -I was getting some unwanted Aelin‚Äôs vibe here‚Äì butthe plot was pretty well-driven after that, allowing each character to have its share of glory in Hybern Battle. And thank god for incredible plot twists or else I would have died a thousand times.The other thing that I really enjoyed is the fact thatthe book was unpredictable. I got all emotional becausethe story has a way of being built up and simply torn down piece by piece by a certain event and you are like ‚ÄúWhat the hell just happened?‚Äù and then being rebuilt once again.I literally went mental in one of the last scene ‚Äì YES, THIS SCENE ‚Äìmy parents were actually concerned because of my change of emotions. I cried during the emotional moments, I got stressed during the battle scenes, I laughed so hard in others, I blushed during the bold sexy scenes, but most of all,I had ‚Äì and still have believe me - embarrassing fangirling moments over the characters.I have a lot of favourite scenes.Like a lot especially those where a potential couple interact ‚ÄìYou should have seen me during NESSIAN SCENES, I was a FANGIRL MONSTER‚Äì butone scene particular brought me to tear and that was RHYS‚Äôs SPEECH BEFORE the FINAL BATTLE.Overall, it wasan EPIC BOOK closing an AMAZING trilogy with immensely ENTERTAINING STORYLINE, characters TO LOVE and a DETAILED fantasy WORLD.Very much worth your time.What are you waiting for?""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Yay!

I don't think I'm going to bother writing a review, simply because I wouldn't do it justice. Neither would it showcase how much it means to me.

Shattered my soul and healed it. Words will not do justice in me expressing how much I adore you, your books, and the extend of what this book means to me. The expectations I had for this book were met above and beyond and I think this book is part of your soul laid bare...I cannot recall crying this much over a book, ever.

I have always been more of a fan of Sarah J Mass fan, but more towards her Thrown of Glass series. I think this is her best book so far. This book just has everything. Great characters, great story, secrets, betrayal, redemptions, ACTION!!!! You name it, it is here. 700 pages and not a line wasted. Hell, I would have been happy with another 700 pages of this standard. The character are great, but there is such great character development that no one is one dimensional the character are conflicted and complex with their own strengths and issues. Every time I learned something about one of the characters, I wanted to know more. Every character had their moment to shine in this book, and every character in this book could very easily star in their own book. That is the depth of the character in this story. Espicallly Rhysand, and anyone in the Court of Dreams.Since the last book, Feyre has returned to the Spring Court to destroy it from within. This is not Feyre crushed by her truma, suffocated by overprotection, or the powerless girl in a world of monsters/guardians. This is the angry, powerful, deadly calculating woman. I like the fact that Rhysand is every bit her match. I am actually interested to see which of them is the more powerful. So far, with centuries of experience behind battle, tactics, and studies, he seems to be a step ahead, but time will tell. However even with all this going on War is coming to Prythian and with all the High Lords in agreement (with their history of grudges and betrayal this is next to impossible ), they are still way out numbered against the King of Hybern and the power of the Calderon. Once again, it falls to the Court of Dreams to lead the charge not only against their enemies but the very thinking of many Prythians as well.This is just an awesome book. I don't think you have to read the other book in the series to love this book, but I would definitely recommend reading the whole series, but I definitely read this one. The more I read, the more I wanted to read. It took me through every emotion, the anger of betrayal, the pride in overcoming adversity, to the election of victory.

Maas-ish in a way that did not surprise me but still made me terribly emotional. It wasn‚Äôt the ACOMAF-emotion, it wasn‚Äôt the EoS-emotion, it wasn‚Äôt the KoA-emotion, it wasn‚Äôt the HoEaB-emotion.This book has had its own emotion, I swear. It was tough, but somehow it was milder than the others previously named.Except for what happened on page 666.I cannot forgive that.I almost had both a heart attack and a stroke at the same time. And I am still not over it and I still feel like SJM pulling shit like this on me is exactly why I might need therapy.After the pure emotion of the previous book in the series,A Court of Wings and Ruinshows the final battle and all its raw and powerful emotions and actions. The dirty and the bad and the ugly ‚Äì there are all of them there.This battle though is also freedom. No one is above scheming anymore. One must do everything they have in power to win because the cause is holy. There are sacrifices that must be made and plans that must be developed.This battle is also about unity and the book shows us how important this is. When there is a common goal at stake, then pride must be left outside when entering the war-tent. And true masters of war know that. Everyone must work together because victory is in the numbers.Aside from the compelling emotions that charge a book deeply powered by the promise of war, there is another facet of the plot.Thecharactersdiscover alter-egos, personalities that they did not know they had. Or they knew and they tried to reprimand them as hard as possible. Everyone has to overcome their own selves and that is a battle too.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a rare person to face who they truly are and not run from it ‚Äì not be broken by it.‚ÄùEvery character has their own secret that springs out with the tiniest occasion it gets to have. We see different angles of Cassian and Azriel, of Mor and Amren, of Nesta and Elain, of Tamlin and Lucien. They all fight two battles ‚Äì of freedom and of self.Rhys and Feyre get to discover and unravel themselves too, but where Feyre finds her vengeful self, her strong and determined essence of a ruler, Rhysand shows us his vulnerable, soft side. The side that determined him to sacrifice himself to keep the ones he loved free.In this book, Rhysand is his ultimate selfless self. And honestly, nothing in this world would make me not love this hell of male.Sarah hit the jackpot with this gem, I‚Äôm telling you.If I had to get through absolutely every single emotion this book gave me then I‚Äôll need something stronger than infused water to keep me going, a big cone of chocolate ice cream and probably a re-read of the whole ACOTAR series just to be sure I get everything right.I love how cunning and ruthless does SJM get when writing her books and even though sometimes there is no need for something like this, ACOWAR had to benefit from that. How else could such a mesmerising story end but in tears of frustration and raw feelings, I‚Äôm asking you?I honestly fell so hard for this series it became one of the things I think I‚Äôll love in my life forever and ever. Glad I could read it and right now, writing this sorry of a review, I am considering so hard re-reading all of the books because damn, this helps my mental health in so many weird ways I can‚Äôt even seem to understand it myself.If you haven‚Äôt read the beauty of the ACOTAR series, please just go for it. Your life will be complete and you‚Äôll probably thank me later ;)‚ÄúMaybe one day, when the earth had grown old and died, when the stars had vanished, too‚Ä¶maybe then, we would return to this place.‚Äù'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4.25/5 stars""Remember that you are a wolf.

Just in case anyone asks me if I have children, I can just show them this.Because all these assholes are my children.I don‚Äôt even know where to start with this review. I‚Äôve been writing things and then deleting them for weeks. Every combination of words just isn‚Äôt therightcombination I need to right the perfect review.Sarah J.

We have been blessed from the heavens.So anyways, I\'ve decided to write whatever the hell comes to my head. So this entire review is one huge train wreck. It\'s an unorganized mess. I\'m gonna apologize for that right now. It also contains unmarked spoilers because it is almost three thousand words long and I don\'t have time to go through and mark every single spoiler.ACOWAR had the unfortunate luck of having to proceed the epicness that was A Court of Mist and Fury. It‚Äôs like being given $1,000,000, spending it all, then being given only a $100,000. Both amounts of money are nice to have, but obviously the million is the better option. Or like watching Beyonce perform live in concert, then having to watch a youtube video of Beyonce. Both are nice, great options, but there is always going to be the preferable one. I actually feel sorry for ACOWAR. It didn‚Äôt deserve to be a follow-up toA Court of Mist and Fury, but it really didn‚Äôt have an option. ACOWAR is better than ,A Court of Thorns and Rosesbut if you were to look up the definition of ‚Äúprefection‚Äù in the dictionary, there will be a picture of the ACOMAF cover.Let me just get some of my thoughts & feels written down real quick. Beware, some might be spoilery. Please proceed with caution.A COURT OF THOUGHTS & FEELS1. Rhys is actually the best fictional character ever and I love him2. Feyre is actually the best fictional character ever and I love her3. Mor is actually the best fictional character ever and I love her4. Lucien is actually the best fictional character ever and I love him5. Amren is actually the best fictional character ever and I love her6. Azriel is actually the best fictional character even and I love him7. Cassian is actually the best fictional character ever and I love him8. Tamlin is actually the worst fictional character ever and I hate him9. I hate him so much10. Seriously11. Who okay‚Äôd Tamlin as a character?12. They should be fired13. Ianthe sucks too14.I‚Äôm glad that bitch got destoryed by the weaver15. We could have done without the sex scenes though.16. Remember when they were in the library? And all they wanted to do was have sex and not read. Talk about unrealistic.17. Rhys is the most dramatic character in YA‚Ä¶...pass it on18. The beginning, when Feyre was at the Spring Court, was actually my favorite part of the entire book? I loved it.19. I was just like yaaas Feyre girl you destroy those losers20. Also when Feyre and Rhys were reunited that was cool21. I wanted that scene to be longer though with a lot less sex22.Also the Suriel‚Äôs death was not okay‚Äôd by me and Sarah will be hearing from my lawyers23. Also who approved the term ‚Äúvulgar gesture???‚Äù They should be fired too.24. Also if I ever hear the word ""mate"" again I\'m gonna spontaneous combust25. Cassian + Feyre = A friendship you will never have26. Mor is gay and all is okay27.Also no one in the night squad died which is really unrealistic to me? Also kinda disappointing. I was preparing myself for a death that never came, which took time away from me preparing my funeral.28. Also Amren is the best thing to come out of this book29. If the sequels aren‚Äôt about her I‚Äôm sueing.30. Also does anyone know why we were fighting this war? I don\'t remember.31. And also does anyone remember how the high lord powers work and why they all happen to be the most powerful people their courts but they get their position through genetics? Because if I haven\'t learned anything from YA literature, at least I\'ve learned that there will always be a chosen one who\'s more powerful than any ruler. So why hasn\'t that happened?CHARACTERS! cHARACTERSFeyre.Feyre is the best? She has evolved so much since the first book. And she\'s so loyal to those she loves. But if she hates you, you are dead. There is no way to save you.Rhys.I don\'t know if you knew this, but in certain countries it\'s agaisnt the law to hate Rhys. He\'s the best.Tamlin.Remember that time when you used to like Tamlin? Hahahaha he\'s an asshole.Mor.She\'s gay! Which is also the only diversity we got in this book.But she\'s the best.Amren.I want to be her when I grow up. She\'s the best.Lucien.I am just so glad that Lucien found God in this book.Cassian.I just love Cassian? I just want him to wrap me up in his wings. He\'s the best.Azriel.I would leave my boyfriend Kaz for Azriel. He\'s the best.SUMMARY AND COMMENTARYI‚Äôm going to do something I never done before in a review. There are so many scenes that I just want to talk about, that I‚Äôm gonna summarize a lot of this book so I can talk about them. This entire thing is spoilery so please don\'t read unless you\'ve read the book.So we start off athellthe Spring Court and Tamlin is being is douchebag self like always. He‚Äôs just hanging around, doing his meninist things. Not realizing that Miss High Lady of the Night Court over there is slowly taking down his court.A nightmare, I‚Äôd told Tamlin.Iwas the nightmare.I was kinda hoping for more telepathic interactions? I wanted Feyre to say something like, ‚ÄúOh Rhys was just terrible to me.‚Äù and Rhys to just pop up and be like, ‚ÄúTerribly good in bed.‚Äù or something like that. But that never happened. SJM really threw away her shot.Hamilton would be disappointed.I‚Äôm going to be honest here. I didn‚Äôt really understand how Feyre took down the Spring Court? Like I know she did it by gaining the people‚Äôs trust. But I didn‚Äôt understand that sunlight scene or all the uneventful trips to the wall. Also Ianthe didn‚Äôt die in the first part which was disappointing. BUT IANTHE DOES GET HER HAND SMASHED INTO LITTLE PIECES BY FEYRE WHICH IS SO FREAKING BRUTAL I screamed the entire time like wow I don‚Äôt like the bitch either but did she really deserve to have her hand continuously smashed? I am a good person who has morals and part of me is still like ‚Äúyeah she deserved that‚ÄùAnyways Feyre is eventually like #byelosers @ the Spring Court and leaves. She takes Lucien with her which is really cool because Lucien deserved better than those assholes. So Lucien and Feyre flee the Spring Court, which at this point is burning.In fact I have an actual, never before seen picture of the spring court taken shortly after Feyre leftSome stuff happens and there\'s fighting because it‚Äôs a high fantasy novel and not having any fighting would probably make it a contemporary or something. But anyhow, Cassian eventually comes and helps Feyre and Lucien with the fighting. And the Cassian/Feyre reunion is the best reunion in this book? Like what Feyre/Rhys reunion?I met those laughing, fierce hazel eyes.Cassian‚Äôs smile softened. ‚ÄúHello, Feyre.""My throat tightened to the point of pain, and I threw my arms around his neck, embracing him tightly.‚ÄúI missed you, too,‚Äù Cassian murmured, squeezing me.Honestly, that scene was the absolute best? Like after that, the Feysand reunion was so underwhelming. It happened just a few pages later but it wasn‚Äôt cute dialogue and hugs and ***friendship*** Their meetup was crying on the floor then having unnecessary explicit sex.SJM is great and all, but her sex scenes are the worst. I understand that sex is a thing that exist and Feysand participates in it, but I just don‚Äôt care about the details. I would rather have more Amren dialogue.So at one point during all this reunion sex, Feyre tells Rhys that he likes a dramatic entrance which has just won an oscar for ‚Äúunderstatement of the year‚Äù. Because obviously, Rhys did not crash Feyre‚Äôs wedding in ACOMAFThe next part of the book is just like plotting and stuff. It‚Äôs kind of boring. I honestly almost fell asleep during the next two hundred pages? I mean I didn‚Äôt though because this is a SJM book but I could have. There was no action. No suspense. At least I had Amren and her I-don‚Äôt-give-a-shit attitude to keep me awake.There is the library scene which is the worst scene in the entire book. So Feyre and Rhys are in this gigantic ass library surrounded by books which is like life goals right? If you don‚Äôt want to be surrounded by books then gtfo of my review. But anyways, instead of appreciating the luxuries they have in their life, Feyre and Rhys spend the entire time flirting with each other? This annoyed me so much. It was the most unrealistic scene in this entire series. I don‚Äôt care if my High Lord mate was there with me. If I was in a library surrounded by books, then he doesn‚Äôt freaking exist in that moment.Also there is a giant monster thing that lives in the basement of this library that everyone is afraid of? #goals‚ÄúIf you hadn‚Äôt stolen my bride away in the night, Rhysand, I would not have been forced to take such drastic measures to get her back.‚ÄùI said quietly, ‚ÄúThe sun was shining when I left you.‚ÄùSo Rhys and Feyre and the rest of the squad decided to throw a party. By party I mean, they decided to get all the incredibly powerful, opinionated fae in one place and try to come to an agreement. This is such a smart idea. Just wow. They also invite Tamlin to be nice and then they act surprised when he shows up??? Like you guys sent him an invite to your birthday party??? It would be rude of him not to come???? Why would he turn down free cake like that?!?!?!Tarquin took him in. Then me. And the others. ‚ÄúI rescind the blood rubies. Let there be no debts between us.‚Äù‚ÄúDon‚Äôt expect Amren to return hers,‚Äù Cassian muttered. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs grown attached to it.‚ÄùSo the greatest thing ever happened during this meeting? And I‚Äôm not talking about when Feyre destroyed Tamlin when he was being a prick. No, I‚Äôm talking about how Amren isn‚Äôt returning her ruby that marks her for death? She‚Äôs so iconic. I want to be Amren when I grow up.Then, while all these high lords were in the same place and wasting time fighting with each other,donald trumpthe King ofHybitchHyburn brings down the wall that they were all tryingnot sodesperately to protect. And again, they were all surprised.Like are you fUCKing kidding me? How did you not see this coming???? You are standing around, doing pratically nothing. Wasting all the time in the world. AND YO UARE SUPRISED THAT HYBITCH IS ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH WITH HIS PLANS. YOU KNOW HE WAS TRYING TO BRING THAT WALL DOWN. he WAS GONNA DO IT AND YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY WAS THE PERFECT OPPURTUNITY. Honestly, I am surprised he didn‚Äôt succeed earlier than this?So noW that the wall has been destroyed and is never coming back, all these high lords realized that if they are going to win this war, they are gonna all get off their asses to do something.Also what even are we fighting for? All I know about this war is that the King of Hyburn is bad and the Night Court Squad is good. How did this war even start? What did Amarantha have to do with anything? Who even is Myriam person and what does she have to do with anything? I know it was probably explained in ACOMAF but that was a year ago and I was too busy placing my attention on Rhys to pay any attention. So at this point I‚Äôm 469 pages into the last book of this trilogy and I don‚Äôt even know what we are fighting for? I‚Äôm emotionally invested in a war I know nothing about. Is this what politics are like?Anyways, the squad and their newly found high lord allies go to take down Hybitch.So then Feyre has this brilliant idea to go find out good friend the Suriel. I forgot the Suriel even existed tbh. He‚Äôs so creepy that I am sure my brain purposely block him out from my ACOTAR memories. So we go find Mr. Suriel and he is near the Weaver‚Äôs cottage.I also blocked the weaver out from my memories so, if you are like me, this is when you bust open your ACOTAR coloring book, flip to the picture of the Weaver, and then pretend to remember.So the Suriel is kinda helpful but unhelpful as always. But Feyre still cares about him becasue why would‚Äôt you care about the creepy monster that doesn‚Äôt even have a proper name and you\'ve only met like three times? So Suriel, that unhelpful yoda, is in the middle of giving Feyre vague advice when THAT BITCH IANTHE SHOWS UP AND JUST SHOOTS HIM WITH AN ARROW FOR NO GOOD REASON. Obviously having a crushed hand hasn‚Äôt affected her aim any.Someone should just kill that bitch already. Which is exactly what Feyre does. And she isn‚Äôt even easy on her. She takes Ianthe into the Weaver‚Äôs cottage and the weaver like eats her. Gross. I would have atleast chosen a less graphic demise. And something that kills her a lot longer.How fortunate are we that we caught the impossible-to-catch Suriel for the third time right near the cottage of a monster thing that likes to eat bitches? We are soooo fortunate.‚ÄúFeyre Archeron,‚Äù the Suriel said again, gazing at the leafy canopy, the sky peeking through it. A painful inhale. ‚ÄúA request.‚ÄùI leaned close. ‚ÄúAnything.‚ÄùAnother rattling breath. ‚ÄúLeave this world...a better place than how you found it.‚ÄùSo after murdering Ianthe, Feyre goes back to the dying Suriel and I haveThe Hunger Gamesflashbacks to Rue‚Äôs death scene. I was kind of expecting Feyre to gather flowers to place around the Suriel. And obviously, even though we are in a world surrounded by magic, there is no way to save the Suriel. He dies. I‚Äôm devastated. You are devastated. I still vaguely remember the Suriel from the past two books.And if I‚Äôm honest, this all could have been avoided if Feyre wasn‚Äôt so dramatic and just asked the Suriel to coffee or something.Oh also, I just happened to have stumbled upon this picture of Feyre that was taken one time after someone was shocked she caught the SurielMore stuff I don‚Äôt care about happens blah blah blah and then Feyre‚Äôs sister, Elain, is somehow kidnapped by the cauldron.Also making a cauldron the most powerful object in all the universe is the stupidest thing I‚Äôve ever read.How did the Cauldron kidnap Elain? I don‚Äôt know it is never really explained how that inanimate object does anything. Remember, I still don‚Äôt know why the crap we are at war here. Anyways, Feyre gets really upset so she goes undercover as Ianthe and infiltrates the Hyburn army and saves Elain. Feyre goes through maybe one obstacle along the way and then returns to her mate Rhys.Also, if you are a person who participates in drinking games, then here‚Äôs a fun one for you while you read the book. Every time the word ‚Äúmate‚Äù is said you drink. And get drunk during the first chapter. You\'ll be in the hospital by the third chapter. So actually don‚Äôt play that drinking game.And was I the only person who felt this entire thing was so unneeded? This is a 700 page book and we are nearing the end and now we are going on missions that run a little too smoothly? Like I know Azriel gets hurt but he‚Äôll heal perfectly fine because we live in a world of healing magic that works on bat wings but not bitch‚Äôs hands.More fighting. There is a lot of fighting that happens. It‚Äôs like they are at war or something.Oh remember Feyre‚Äôs father? Yeah, I don‚Äôt either. But he comes back. I didn‚Äôt know he was gone but he came back with ships named after his daughters and Odette fromSwan Lakebut instead of a Swan, she‚Äôs a firebird which might just be a stupid name for a phoenix, oh and he name isn‚Äôt Odette. Anyways, her father finds this queen they just happened to be looking for even though there‚Äôs no way he could have possibly known that because he has been missing for 37297843 years. So obviously, because of this all his past sins are forgiven instantly. Then her father eventually dies because ofTrumpHybitch and we are suppose to be sad about it but I‚Äôm still standing here likeThen, on page 666, because Sarah is in fact the devil, the unthinkable happens. MY BABY RHYS WHO IS SUPPOSE TO BE PROTECTED AT ALL TIMES DIES. YES DIES. AND AT THIS POINT I‚ÄôM CRYING IN THE CORNER AND WANTING TO THROW THE BOOOK INTO A VOLCANOAnd I‚Äôm just like, ‚ÄúIf he ficking stays dead then at least all 700 pages of this book will make great kindling to warm my now cold heart‚ÄùBut then I remember ACOTAR and how Feyre here died and then was brought back to life so I start looking at the other high lords who happen to be near us at this moment and I‚Äôm just ‚ÄúHey do a girl a favor here AND BRING BACK MY BOYFRIEND.‚ÄùBut then I also remember there‚Äôs a certain asshole who is also a high lord who has to help and I Start FREAKING out but then he comes through and he‚Äôs just like ‚ÄúBe happy, Feyre,‚Äù and SAVES RHY‚ÄôS LIFEYou still an asshole Tam, but maybe just a little bit less.ANd I‚Äôm just crying in the corner even harder than before.Then somehow they defeat the King of Hybitch and Feyre and Rhys live happily ever after. Both are alive. The #NightSquad is still alive. Beause that is super realistic.Looks like the only person who is dead here is me. Oh well.CONCLUSIONSo while ACOMAF is still the best, this is still a great novel and I loved it? Being with all my children again is all I have ever asked for in life and I \'m just glad that they all ended up happy.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '4.8/5 Stars ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è‚ÄúOnly you can decide what breaks you, Cursebreaker. Only you.‚ÄùLet me talk to you about this book. This bookKILLED ME. This bookDESTROYED ME. This bookANNIHILATED ME. This bookOBLITERATED ME. This bookELIMINATED ME. This bookWIPED ME OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH. This bookEXTERMINATED ME. This bookERADICATED ME. I will never recover. How can I function after this fucking book? I was supposed to read it slowly becauseA Court of Frost and Starlightwill arrive here after a week and I have had serious issues waiting for those books in the past, but I couldn\'t stop. The last 300 pages were marvelous, they gripped me by the balls and took me with them on this amazing journey. I was reading till6amyesterday. No regrets. The feels are always heightened this ungodly time of day. And I\'m so happy I read this book at that time. But let\'s start from the very beginning.Looming war threatens all Feyre holds dear in the third volume of the #1 New York Times bestselling A Court of Thorns and Roses series.Feyre has returned to the Spring Court, determined to gather information on Tamlin\'s manoeuvrings and the invading king threatening to bring Prythian to its knees. But to do so she must play a deadly game of deceit ‚Äì and one slip may spell doom not only for Feyre, but for her world as well.As war bears down upon them all, Feyre must decide who to trust amongst the dazzling and lethal High Lords ‚Äì and hunt for allies in unexpected places.This book started off strong enough. I was extremely excited about Feyre infiltrating Tamlin\'s Court and taking him down. She would be such a badass. I expected this part of the book to be bigger, to be honest. About 250 pages, to be exact. I really enjoyed the scheming, the planning, the cleverness of Feyre, how she turned everyone against one another so brilliantly. I hated Tamlin and Ianthe more in this part of the book, obviously. They were both manipulative, controlling and toxic. They truly deserved each other. Lucien gained some respect from me in this part of the book. I was really disappointed in him inA Court of Mist and Fury.Afterwards, the pace of the book gets a bit slower than I would have wanted. I expected it to happen, because the ""format"" of these books is always the same, for me at least. A very powerful beginning, then the pace lags a little bit and in the end the trueBAM! But it was different for me in this book. I didn\'t feel the same excitement its predecessor gave me (till page 400). And I understand why. The previous book opened up a whole entire different world to me. From the Spring Court and everything we thought we knew was right, everything changed. And we start off getting to know everything in the Night Court, and it was all exhilarating. As much and even more as it was getting to know the entire world of everything in the first book. Getting to know Rhysand and his true incentives, the inner circle, the world, seeing the romance bloom between Rhysand and Feyre. In this book, everything is settled. We know everyone, the world, the romance is stable. There aren\'t as many new things happening, except when we get to page 400. Till this page, I would have given this book 4 stars, which is low for this series for me, because I LIVE FOR IT.I\'m going to talk a bit about the first 400 pages, before my favorite part of the book starts. After Feyre arrived in the Night Court with Lucien, everything took a certain pace. We got to feel Velaris again, the inner circle, Rhysand, the conflict, the problems. A gargantuan War is coming, and they had to deal with it. Gather allies, forge a plan, make actions, bargains. This entire chunk of the book was about the war and how they would end it. And I truly enjoyed that but it didn\'t keep me on my toes, you know? Till page 400.PAGE 400. THAT\'S WHERE THE REAL SHIT STARTS. And then we got to page 400. When the meeting starts. This is the part I couldn\'t leave the book down. The part where if anyone commanded me to leave the book down, I would have killed them. Like fucking Feyre would. This meeting was so enthralling. The tension was keeping me enraptured the entire time. I\'m content that we got to know the other High Lords of Prythian, we got a better understand of the world and its people. They were all truly incredible characters (except Beron), especially Helion. I loved his humor, his swag and that he\'s bisexual. I noticed something very important in this book. There was more representation. Not enough but more. We got to see black characters, bisexual characters, gay characters, lesbian characters (MOR I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, I\'M SO PROUD OF YOU GIRL). This series isn\'t known for its diversity, but it was nice to see some more examples popping up. It was refreshing.But anyway, let\'s continue with the meeting. I was so proud of all my Night Court babies, how they handled it. Each question a challenge that was met brilliantly.IF I COULD I WOULD STAND UP AND APPLAUD AZRIEL FOR ATTACKING ERIS. FUCKING ERIS.And also my Queen Feyre, who showed her true powers without fear of the High Lords. Of so many High Lords, who could easily kill her. And then Tamlin enters the Dawn Court room. I thought there was a limit to how much I hated him, but he surpassed that. His crude, distasteful and inappropriate comments were so unnecessary. Dude, we know how fucking butthurt you are that your girlfriend left you for a better man than you, but we\'re here to discuss how to prevent the War, your comments are fucking irrelevant. Be a better man for once and show some restraint. Now wonder even Lucien left you. Lucien. Oh man. Helion is Lucien\'s father. I was so fucking astonished. This book bestowed many plot twists for us, and this was one that gripped me tightly. I don\'t even know the reason, I just really like Lucien all of a sudden. More than I liked him in the first book. And I genuinely appreciated how he trusted Feyre, and how he acclimated himself to the Night Court. How he saw good in Rhysand and his people, after all the propaganda of the latest hundreds of years. How he wanted to be useful and help do something significant for the War.I WANT TO DISCUSS HOW FEYRE IS SUCH A SHIPPER, IT HURTS. Feyre is like us. She ships her friends with each other and tries to make the ship happen. I\'m so proud of her. I\'m so proud that she actively participates in her friend\'s happiness. She ships everything I ship, and I couldn\'t not notice it, it\'s so obvious. I want her to succeed. I want her to find the best fucking girlfriend for Mor, cause my girl deserves happiness. They all deserve it, but her more, in the relationship factor. I\'m very sorrowful that in this world, a lesbian woman can\'t thrive. It mirrors our own world, to be exact. Some people have the resources and the family behind to support them, and some people just, don\'t. Mor has been so unlucky in the romance department, with her cruel family stopping everything that she does. I want her to come out, and I want Feyre to be beside her and support her.I WANT TO TALK ABOUT NESTA AND CASSIAN. NESTA AND CASSIAN. The ship I was rooting for since the previous book. The ship that is killing my heart slowly and painfully.THEY HAVE TO BE MATES. PLEASE TELL ME THEY\'RE MATES. And even if they\'re not, their dynamic is so strong. Their scenes so utterly powerful, even them staring at each other had me dying in my seat. I want them to thrive. They are my favorite couple, after Rhysand and Feyre, and I want them to prosper. There was such a gradual progress with them. Sarah handled this couple\'s dynamic amazingly. How we started seeing, little by little, how Nesta started caring more about Cassian. How gentle he was with her, with her feelings. He didn\'t push her, he didn\'t drive her to the edge. I want more of them, I want them to take over the world. Nesta is such a favorite character of mine. Strong, unyielding, snarky, flawed, raw, true. She is perfectly flawed, the way I like my characters to be. This book series doesn\'t favor flawed characters. Most of them are impeccable, outside and inside. But Nesta isn\'t. She still shows her humanity and I love her for it.We talked about Nesta... now we have to talk about Elain. Useless, needless Elain. I didn\'t like her in this book. I loathed her moping around, her extremely extravagant sensitivity, her outmost obsolescence. I couldn\'t stand everyone defending and protecting her, all the fucking time. Oh poor little Elain, how bad must it be for you to be immortal, young and beautiful forever, aw I feel so sorry for you. She didsomethingin the end by stabbing The Hybern King, but not something miraculous. Nesta integrated the action. I just didn\'t enjoy her character in this book, she was utterly annoying to me.This War man... this War. It was the most tit gripping thing I have read in a very long time. The adrenaline was high up in heaven. It was jaw dropping, breathtaking, awe-inspiring. When the hope was lost, there would be hope, and when there was hope, it would be taken harshly out of our grip. There was so much shit happening, so many characters appearing, to help, to condemn. Strategies being thrown our the window, plans succeeding, failing, bargains breaking. There was just.. so much happening. I couldn\'t keep track of everything. The action was astounding, the plot twists out of this world, the thrill spectacular. I devoured these chapters in a heartbeat. I wasn\'t even looking at the pages or chapters, or even time, I was just reading. This book was a true and amazing ending to an incredible series. I\'m so happy I picked these books up. This series made me love fantasy again. I have stopped being a fan of fantasy for many many years, and these books reintroduced me to its virtues.I WANT TO READ MORE FANTASY BECAUSE OF THESE BOOKS YEAH.RHYS\'S DEATH GUYS. It happened in page666, how convenient. I didn\'t feel a heartbeat for a minute. I know he would survive because he\'s in the next book, but you know how it is. I was utterly heartbroken by Feyre\'s reaction. She made me feel what she was feeling. I cried. Literally. And hear me out a bit. This is a huge deal for me. I never cry with books. The only books I have ever cried about are theHarry Potterseries and theOutlanderseries. Which are my all time favorite books of all the fucking universe. When I started crying, I was so surprised at myself. I was so happy I did. Because Rhys has become one of my all time favorite characters, and seeing his demise broke me. Like Feyre\'s heart was broken. And then Tamlin gives his last speck of light and saves him. Let\'s talk about him and his redemption arc.You have seen my feelings about him in the fist part of this review. In the end, they shifted, just a bit. I truly appreciated how he helped Feyre, how he saved her. And how he saved Rhysand\'s life. I don\'t like him, but I value how he got over his grudge, and actually helped everyone, for the good of Prythian. I forgive you, Tamlin, you\'re still a piece of shit of a character with many unsolved issues, but as Feyre said‚ÄúI hope you find happiness, too.\'""And I did. Not just for what he\'d done for Rhys, but...Even for an immortal, there was not enough *time* in life to waste it on hatred. On feeling it and putting it into the world.So I wished him well -- I truly did, and hoped that one day...One day, perhaps he would face those insidious fears, that destructive rage rotting away inside him.‚ÄùYou get a pass, bitch. I\'m curious of what will happen to his relationship with Lucien. It will be interesting.I have written 12000 words for this review. And 8000 are left. I will surpass Goodread\'s character limit. Lmao. I had so much to say about this book, the ending of a marvelous series. I couldn\'t help myself and I\'m very sorry for this chaos of a review. My feels are still raw and unedited. And if you\'re reading this right now, you\'re a true hero for going through all of this shittone. And I love you for it.To sum it all up, this book was a truly magnificent journey and an incredible ending to a wonderful series. I\'m literally speechless, and I will think about this book a lot. For a very long time. Nothing else more I can say, this review explains it all. I will crawl now to my bed and die peacefully of the feels. And till the next one... K BYE!7500 characters left out of 20000.LMFAO.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5/5 ‚úßÔΩ•Ôæü: *""I would have waited five hundred more years for you. A thousand years.""This was the easiest 5 stars of my life, and for sure my favourite book in the series. I wish I could attach the video of me hysterically crying. I felt so much for this story, world and characters. So many things like tugged my heart strings, whilst being whimsical at the same time. I laughed and cried - this was just sooooo good. Getting into fantasy is really hard sometimes but this made it so easy. ‚ãÜÀô‚ü°‚ô°‚ï∞‚îà‚û§PlotI think this book is a lot more plot focused than ACOMAF. They\'re dealing with strained political bonds with a devastating war on the horizon. It was so cool to see the other courts and all their personalities, how they all had their own stories that tie in with our main characters. As a certified romance hater, this was much more my style. There is stilla lotof romance to swoon for, between multiple characters and it was just *chef\'s kiss*.I will not stop talking about found family - these moments were responsible for me crying my eyes out.‚ï∞‚îà‚û§CharactersPersonally,Feyrewas a lot more likeable in this book. Less whining, more protective sister, protective family member. She\'s still not perfect and buts her nose into situations which I feel like she shouldn\'t, but it didn\'t make me dislike her, it\'s just a flaw. She has some very epic and real adventurous moments in this, and her anointment asHigh Lady of the Night Courtonly made me like her more.Rhysand, what a sweetheart. I love him to bits, he\'s soft on the inside but a bit of a powerful arrogant cheeky guy on the outside. He\'s sooooo sweet to Feyre and as someone who loveswords of affirmationI found him so loveable. He loves his family so deeply and that is represented further in this book. I loveCassianmore though. He\'s like a man man, also my style, but has a very soft spot for a girl. So adorable.BothNestaandElainmade me fall in love with them. They\'re so different, and they developed differently during this story, but the outcome was still the same. Nesta was starting to get on my nerves at one point because she\'s a bitice coldbut it grows on you, as it grows on a particular Illyrian warrior. I love the fact that they both have a special power that contributes to their overall adventure/mission. I\'m so excited to see them more in the next book. ìç¢÷¥‡ªãüå∑Õô÷í‚ï∞‚îà‚û§World/SettingListen - this world was beautifully painted. The characters in this were painted so vividly, I could imagine each of them and they were all beautiful. As we see a lot more of the different courts, we see how different they are, both in attitude and visual representation, which was so well done. I could see Autumn court, Summer court, Winter court, Day & Dawn, and it\'s just so cool. I can\'t decide which one I would like to live in more, but I\'m leaning towards Winter.‚ï∞‚îà‚û§PacingSomething was always happening, there was always something to be interested in, laugh at, or cry at. There were some really tense moments at the ends of chapters that kept me hooked and this is a looooong book (703 pages). My ADHD struggled at times, but that doesn\'t reflect the story.‚ï∞‚îà‚û§EnjoymentAs you probably can tell, I enjoyed this so much. Like so so much. I felt the characters, was invested in the story, kept wanting to read it. Personally the story had everything I wanted, found family, epic battles and high stakes. So good.‚ïî‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê ‚ùÄ‚Ä¢¬∞‚ùÄ¬∞‚Ä¢‚ùÄ ‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïóscore card:plot: 5/5characters: 5/5world/setting: 5/5pacing: 5/5enjoyment: 5/5total: 5/5‡©à‚ú©‚Äß‚ÇäÀö‚ïö‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê ‚ùÄ‚Ä¢¬∞‚ùÄ¬∞‚Ä¢‚ùÄ ‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïù‚ÇäÀö‚äπ‚ô° reading log09/05 9:30am ‡≠®‡ßégod damn I hate tamlin so much I hate the spring court so much what a sad sad man09/05 6:53am ‡≠®‡ßéazriel and mor are positively killing me08/05 6:50am ‡≠®‡ßédid i get up at 6am to keep reading this? yes. is something awful about to go down in the story? yes.07/05 8:10pm ‡≠®‡ßéi love this world, i love reading about these characters i love them all in their own unique way - but MAN this is long and my adhd cannot handle it - azriel is my favourite character so far, nesta\'s coldness is getting a little on my nerves but I\'m sure its for a reason07/05 4:31pm ‡≠®‡ßénesta be like ü•∂ü•∂ü•∂05/05 8:35pm ‡≠®‡ßéoh good i\'ve already cried, found family is my biggest weakness i can\'t05/05 6:44pm ‡≠®‡ßégod this book is long so much has happened and im only 13% of the way in05/05 12:02pm ‡≠®‡ßétamlin is stupid‚ÇäÀö‚äπ‚ô° pre-readingit\'s tiimmeeeeee!! i\'ve been DYING to know how this is going to play out i\'m so excited the last one had me in an emotional ball on the floor - i expect nothing less from this one (although i know the second one is most people\'s favourite).i\'m so excited to see more of nesta and elain!! and of course everyone\'s favourite book boyfriend, rhysand.‚ú¶\u3000\u3000\u3000.\u3000\u3000. \u3000\u2008Àö\u3000.\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 . ‚ú¶\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000Àö\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 . ‚òÖ‚ãÜ..\u2002\u2002 \u3000\u3000Àö\u3000‚ú≠\u3000 \u3000\u3000*\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000‚ú¶\u3000\u3000\u3000.\u3000\u3000.\u3000\u3000\u3000‚ú¶\u3000Àö \u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u2008Àö\u3000.Àö\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000‚ú≠\u3000.\u3000\u3000. \u3000\u2008Àö\u3000.\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 ‚ú¶may tbr:‡≤á.salt to the sea‡≤á. powerless‡≤á. house of earth and blood‡≤á. everyone in my family has killed someone‡≤á. bride‡≤á. listen for the lie‡≤á. she\'s not sorry‡≤á. love on the brain‡≤á. the familiar‡≤á.a court of wings and ruin'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""symptoms - sweaty palms, increased heart rate, calling everyone'mate.'diagnosis - rhysand withdrawals.treatment - rereading this book.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'A Court of Wings and Ruinis the third book in the ACOTAR series by Sarah J. Maas, and it\'s wild. The book starts with Feyre spying on the Spring Court for Rhys, pretending to be Tamlin\'s faithful wife again so she can undermine his Court from the inside.I absolutely adored the first part of the book. I love how clever Feyre was, setting up the destruction of the Spring Court while no one knew what she was planning. The way she tricked Tamlin was gold.After she returns to the Night Court, war breaks out between Hybern and Prythian. She goes on a quest to find the Cauldron, an ancient source of magic that might just stop the war. But not all of the Courts are willing to help her, and she will have to call on other magical creatures and forces to aid her in her search.I didn\'t like this part of the book as much. It felt very aimless to me, and drawn out for so long that the plot points lost all meaning. I wasn\'t bored, exactly, but the plot just feltwrongto me, as if something were missing. It was pretty straightforward in the beginning‚Äîfind the Cauldron, destroy Hybern‚Äîbut then a bunch of subplots were introduced. Feyre had to make deals with spirits and gods, she had to avoid Hybern‚Äîit was just... a lot, and yet too little at the same time. What do I mean by ""too little?"" Well...The pacing was dreadful. That doesn\'t mean I was bored.The plot built up far too quickly. Unlike inThrone of Glass,where the plot built gradually and climaxed in KoA, the plot here came out of nowhere. The villain, the King of Hybern, was so one-dimensional and uninteresting. His motives didn\'t make sense, the little history that was thrown in was so random and didn\'t help make him a better character at all, and his death was so unsatisfying. The character who killed him... well, I\'m not going to spoil it, but I don\'t think they were the right character to do the job. See the spoilery section for more on that.This series would have been better as just a regular romance, without all this...plot.I only really cared about the Inner Circle anyway. If it were just a faerie romance with great side characters and a found family, I would. Not. Care. That\'s all I want. Adding a whole epic plotline to the story just drags it down. I much preferred the more introspective ACOMAF.I really, really loved Feyre in ACOMAF, and now? Not so much. She has too many powers. She can do everything the High Lords can and more. I love how she\'s the first High Lady, but honestly, she has every power and it gets annoying when she can do basically anything.However, there are still times when I like Feyre more than Aelin. She\'s more mild and less overbearing, and I like that in a protagonist. She\'s persistent when she needs to be, and determined to learn. She understands the meaning of responsibility.Rhys before the mating bond is superior to Rhys after the mating bond. For one, he was less protective in the beginning of ACOMAF versus ACOWAR. I\'m tired of overprotective, aggressive male characters. I miss the Rhysand of ACOMAF, the one with a sharp sense of humor and patient respect for Feyre. He still has some of the traits he exhibited earlier, but they\'re dimmed in the face of his overpoweringmaleness that can sometimes turn into toxic masculinity. Thank you, next.üö®üö®üö®SPOILERS AHEAD, PROCEED WITH CAUTIONüö®üö®üö®Elain killed the King of Hybern and I am angry.She\'s incapable of doing anything useful and everyone, including the other characters, consistently forgets she exists. How am I supposed to believe she sneaked up behind the big baddie and stabbed him? How is she the hero here? Okay, maybe this is her big moment, when she overcomes her fear and does something awesome, but... where\'s the buildup?I have a theory that NoBrain Elain is actually whip-smart and pretends to be meek and helpless just to manipulate everyone around her. And I have evidence.1. One of Elain\'s only lines of dialogue is, ""I hope they all burn in hell."" And everyone is shocked because she likes gardens and flowers and she hardly ever talks so they all think she\'s weak. But what if this is just Elain\'s true side showing through?2. She holds all of the characters in the palm of her hand. Nesta is obsessed with protecting her. Azriel is in love with her. Feyre will do anything to save her when she gets captured, and so Rhys likes her too just because Feyre does. They risked all of their lives just to sneak into Hybern\'s camp and save her, despite the fact that she has done nothing useful this entire book. What if she\'s manipulating them all, using them for her own gain?That\'s my wild theory. Have fun with it.At the end of the book, Amren sacrifices herself to destroy Hybern. This had the potential to be a really powerful, touching moment. But no. She got brought back from the dead because no one EVER dies in fantasy books. And this makes me mad. Her sacrifice lost all of its pain because there were literally no consequences.üö®üö®üö®SPOILERS HAVE ENDEDüö®üö®üö®NoBrain ElainWritten by SofiaNoBrain Elain puts me in painHer stupid shenanigans make me mad againShe\'s a pointless character who does nothingBut add to my unending sufferingShe never talks, but everyone loves herMaybe it\'s trauma, but I still sufferShe gets into trouble and everyone criesI just smile and hope she diesShe belongs with Tamlin, that much is trueIf she ends with Azriel, I will sueNesta may be angering, but at least she\'s not thisI would banish Elain from this earth with my last wishElain, ElainNoBrain ElainNobody cares about your painThis may sound harsh, but rest assuredThe whole book community thinks you\'re absurd3.5 starsACOTAR reviewACOMAF reviewcredit'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'You know you\'re a dedicated fan when you mark an untitled book set to release in 2017 as a ""want to read"".

Maaswiped that sneer off my face and proved me wrong. Again.A Court of Wings and Ruinis a work of art that will make you run out of proper adjectives to describe all the pandemonium, magic and apocalypse it entails. The kind that will pull at your heartstrings right from the get-go and hold you with its sharp claws, imploring you to devour it.Intense action, delicious romance, backstabbing, ferociously deadly creatures, raw brutality, lies and disguise are all ornately woven into a tale that will cocoon you into the Fae world and soothe you, leaving you anchored by nothing but a tempest in your lungs.There was darkness and light, storm and calm, despair but also hope. You will see battles mired with savagery and viciousness, harsh and regrettable decisions and nerve-wracking adventures in a world where humans are perceived as weak and easily destroyable.Sarah J. Maas's world building is so exquisite that I felt detached from my own body, incapable of focusing on anything else happening around me, only flipping the pages with an acute yearning of what's about to happen. She delivers plenty of magic and mayhem, with a knack for perfect pacing of the story and character reflection.CharactersThe Inner Circle, my favourite squad ‚ù§I love their devotion to each other. Their ability to be kind in spite of harsh circumstances, their ability to love despite enduring a millenia of cruelty. They're all so full of light, it makes we want to smile and simultaneously tear up at their unconditional loyalty. I was so attached to them, like I was bound to them by an invisible, irrevocable tether. When they struggled, I struggled. When they were hurt, I was hurt. I could feel their rage, loyalty and honour coursing through my veins, like a shrieking void.High LordsI don't think I would have enjoyed this book at all if not for them. I'm glad thatSarah J. Maasshowed them in a new light, something readers haven't seen in the previous books.As amusing as their banter was, I also feel deeply moved by their actions, their unwavering faith in one another during the battle despite their iffy past.Be itHelion,the Spell Cleaver;Thesan,the healer;Tarquin,the sympathetic and thoughtful leader;Kallias,the snow/ice manipulator andBeron,..... Never mind, I didn't really like him; I loved them with every echoing heartbeat. (Beron being the exception)\u200eOh andTamlin. I apologise if I've been harsh to him after readingA Court of Mist and Fury, but I have a new found respect for him. Despite his impropriety initially, the fact that he finally rises to be a better man by not dwelling on petty vengeance and retribution hit me in the gut and made my eyes burn with warm tears.WhereA Court of Mist and Furywas romance heavy (not that I'm complaining),A Court of Wings and Ruinwas action-packed and was cluttered with twists and magical intrigue and SJM definitely didn't let the romance aspect of the book obliterate the subplot, deftly exploring all the details.I feel weighed down by the intensity of this composition and I vow never to let it slip even from the deepest clutches of my mind ‚ù§""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '4.75!""Night Triumphant- and the Stars Eternal.‚ÄùI might be in the minority here but I liked ACOWAR more than ACOMAF but this has only happened during this reread before this reread the four times that I read this series I always preferred ACOMAF maybe because I loved the romance but reading this now really made me appreciate the plot and the politics in this book. This book was exactly 700 pages long and 700 pages have never felt this short because I actually flew through them and despite rereading this series every year there were still moments where I forgot certain things happen and the plot twists surprised me as well, the way it was written made it very easy to read a 700 paged book.‚ÄúI see all of you, Rhys. And there is not one part that I do not love with everything I am.‚ÄùFeyreI feel like Feyre is very underrated, her cunningness is overshadowed a lot by the fandom because of how compassionate she is because in this because people really rave about how cunning she was and how she made a fool out of the spring court and hey, believe me I loved that scene to probably me best part in this book but then I looked back and saw that Feyre has always been this clever and she made it till this book because of how smart she was and I just feel like its very underappreciated. I love her.‚ÄúYou do not fear... You do not falter. You do not yield.‚ÄùRhysandI really like Rhys\'s character bur he is probably my least favorite bat boy lol. I liked him, he made rash decisions some I understood, some I did not but in the end it all worked out well. I love how cocky he was and how he presented himself with this calm composure and IDGAF attitude and I also like how he was actually nice and not a total bitch, how he helped everyone and would do anything for the people he loved. The romance between Feyre and Rhys was good as well and I liked how well it was managed in the span of three books.‚ÄúWe\'re all a broken, in our own ways - In places no one might see.‚ÄùThe Inner CircleAmren as always was the character I loved and my heart was beating so fast during those final pages because if ykyk, Cassian, him and Nesta in this book ATE and I loved him. Mor, I was justice for her, I need answers, I love her but I also want to know more about her because we only know bits and pieces about her past and nothing more and finally Azriel, I love that man so much, everything that he said and did was beautiful.‚ÄúOnly you can decide what breaks you, Cursebreaker. Only you.‚ÄùI think the plot, the entire build up and how it all paid off was really well done and the action sequences were also detailed and really well written, The court intrigue was also something I appreciated. Especially that highlords meeting (prolly my favorite scene) and the bargains that were made, the satisfying endings that we got, the reunions and all of the massive forces aligning together with twists that you won\'t see coming and it was just really good as for the world building I am stunned how it still grew and morphed into something more beautiful.Overall, a really solid conclusion to this series and while tog remains superior, this series will have a special place in my heart!!____Listening to the graphic audio just so I can hear the loml Az say""Be careful of how you speak of my high lady""ü§≠Reread #4'}]"

can rate this book with 4 or 5 stars. I haven‚Äôt read something so unentertaining in a long time and only wasted my time for ten long hours.The book was way too long and too much. Too much drama, too much plot, too much was happening. I was half way into it when I already forgot what happened before because it.was.just.to.much, of everything. I wanted to dnf this book 10% into it, because it was so boring, but I never dnf a book before so I wanted to keep going. But it was just awful. I couldn‚Äôt wait until I finally (FINALLY) got to the end. (Have to confess I also skipped a few parts, mainly Anastasias chapters, halfway through the book because these awful, boring scenes weren‚Äôt bearable anymore after a few hours into it.)Aaron was a walking red flag since his introduction. I didn‚Äôt like him for a second (he gave me major bipolar disorder vibes with his mood swings). His character was awful und I didn‚Äôt enjoy a second of him being in this book. I understand that he was the main villain, but he shouldn‚Äôt have so much scene time. The main part of this book was for me hating him and I couldn‚Äôt enjoy anything beside because the next second he was back again and my mood fell. I don‚Äôt understand how people could keep up with him for so long, he clearly was a bad person (even if dumb Anastasia says other wise).Sabrine I liked just fine, but it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt sit right with me reading about her behaviors while she is representing a muslim girl (or I suspect she is muslim because most of Algerians are), but I don‚Äôt know if she is for sure.Beside her there were too many side characters, I can‚Äôt even remember everyone who was there and why they were there.It‚Äôs shocking but the one person I disliked more than Aaron was Anastasia herself. Her whole character was so so so unlikable for me. Her freak-outs, how bad she treated Nathan even though he was always nice to her. The on, off, cold, hot she gave him and how she only liked him when she was drunk was annoying and irritating. Sometimes she acted like the biggest child and I hate how no one stood up to her and beat her in place, because she was such a mean person sometimes to the people around her (mainly Nathan who she always attacks without even knowing if he done anything wrong). She deserved to end up losing everything she worked towards. These ‚Äûgetting under his skin‚Äú actions were unnecessary and childish. It was not funny at all and I hate Nathan for playing along with her every time she fucked him over again.It‚Äôs paradox how she is portrayed as a dominant, strong willed character with everyone else, but she lets Aaron walk over her over and over again till the last 2 chapters.I really hated her for every second she was present in this book more than I hated Aaron.What was Ryan‚Äôs purpose? He was a major part for the first half of the book but in the end he wasn‚Äôt even mention. Like he didn‚Äôt exist and the author just forgot he was there once. But he also is a person I didn‚Äòt like. He was nice and all but he was interested in Olivia, wants more while laying half naked in a bed with another woman ? Kuddling her ? I wouldn‚Äôt want to talk to a boy who is seeing other girls beside me, let alone doing sleepovers with his ex-fuck-buddy.The only part of this book I liked was Nathan‚Äôs character. He was cute and polite, respectful, a green flag boy the whole time (even when he was mad that is girlfriend was fucked over and blinded by another man, as he should). He was attentive and always courteous. He cared for others more than he cared for himself. He took care of Anastasia, of his team, his sister. He was totally a golden retriever with a heart of gold. I wish he hadn‚Äôt ended up with Anastasia. He clearly deserves something so much better than her. Someone who loves him as equal as he loves, and Anastasia‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt that. She was just awful to him, treats him poorly and didn‚Äôt deserve him or his kindness.This one star is for Nathan and Nathan only.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'To sum up my thoughts very quickly‚Ä¶ there was too much going on and yet somehow there was also absolutely nothing going on - so out of a weird mix of annoyance and boredom, I DNFd it at 50%But in case your interested in details‚Ä¶I should have realized right away that I wasn‚Äôt gonna like this book when I had a really hard time digesting the writing. There was something about it that wasn‚Äôt flowing smoothly from the pages into my brain and therefore I was reading it really slowly and found myself putting it down a lot (which is a very bad sign)Then there was also so much info-dumping for all the side characters. It felt like she already pre-planned out a multi book companion series and was trying too hard to get us invested in all of the side characters by giving them each so much detail and page time.We‚Äôve got her best friend (Liv) who‚Äôs starting to get with his best friend (Robbie). Her skating partner (Aaron) who‚Äôs mentally and emotionally abusive to her (but she doesn‚Äôt realize this even though she‚Äôs been in therapy for years and supposedly is really good at expressing her thoughts and figuring out how she‚Äôs feeling‚Ä¶ but okay.) There‚Äôs also a bunch of guys from the hockey team that end up becoming a part of this large friend group that‚Äôs forming (JJ, Henry, Russ, Bobby + more). Did I forget to mention Robbie? Yea, he‚Äôs Anastasia‚Äôs fuck buddy at the beginning of the book because she doesn‚Äôt have any interest in committing to a relationship because she just wants to focus on her training and skating career‚Ä¶. but it‚Äôs okay because early on he ends up starting a relationship with someone that Liv (Anastasia‚Äôs best friend) absolutely hates‚Ä¶ so now her and Robbie are just best friends who sleep in the same bed together without shirts on sometimes‚Ä¶ nbd (üôÑ)Then there‚Äôs Nate. He‚Äôs a sweetie and I liked him enough - but not enough to keep reading. Especially because I really didn‚Äôt like Anastasia. As for their relationship‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt like that either. It was a-lot of tell and no show - and the few times there was show and they actually had a minute alone with each other, they would just get it on (yawn).As for the actual plotline - there was none. Yup. None ‚Äî Basically all these characters meet for the first time when they are forced to start sharing an ice rink and that‚Äôs basically just a setup for them all to become friends‚Ä¶ and then the rest of the story (from what I‚Äôve read) is just watching them do everyday college shit like go to parties and bars and study and go to training and boring things like that.The funny thing is, is that right at the halfway point is when we get the second half of what was mentioned in the synopsis‚Ä¶ where Aaron (the abusive skating partner) causes a ton of drama by getting injured and blaming it on Nate - so Nate ends up getting benched for a while and decides to fill in as Anastasia‚Äôs new skating partner‚Ä¶. and that‚Äôs right around where I gave up on the story.‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm just sayin‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt put something in the synopsis if it‚Äôs not gonna happen until midway through - IMO the synopsis should only have information that takes place in the first 50-100 pages‚Ä¶ but what do I know?So to sum all that up again‚Ä¶ there were too many characters, too much drama, and somehow there was nothing actually going on other than all these people hanging out a bunch and Anastasia getting it on with Nate every time she was drunk and horny.Is it crazy to say that I have so much more I could complain about?? Even after my longest review ever?? It‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôll stop myself here‚Ä¶ but just know‚Ä¶ I had more.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Is this what kids are into nowadays? Am I too ancient, too old, too out of touch with reality to understand what gen Z likes?""stop slapping your balls this loud""""her ass smells so good""""can Lola really hear my balls?""Yes, these are all quotes from this book.Well... there was zero plot. Every single character talked like they were 15 and just found out about sex through giphs on tumblr. And honestly, sex is the only thing they talk about. Every single page. There is nothing but: who\'s hooking up with who, how many kinky things they\'ve done, waking up and training while wasted from the parties they went to the night before, and how loud his balls are against her thighs when they\'re having sex.The FMC has a hardcore/severe eating disorder. AND THERE IS LEGIT A SENTENCE WHERE THEY EXCUSE A GUY KNOCKING SOMEONE UP BY SAYING:oh, it wasn\'t his fault, he doesn\'t know a lot about pregnancy. he\'s a good guy, he\'s just a 25 year old MAN who doesn\'t understand how sex works. so you gotta give him a pass.But yeah, if you want to know what this one is about, it\'s just a wattpad book that hasn\'t been edited. But I guess these are the books that get publisher deals nowadays.There are too many characters that are introduced in a very confusing way. They get yelled at by their coaches every 10 pages and talk about sex and alcohol for the remaining pages. Rinse and repeat. They all end up sharing a rink and spend a lot more time together, yatta, yatta.It\'s not the worst book I have ever read. But... It is written like a Wattpad story. Repetitive, long and childish.

I didn't like the heroine because she was presented as someone determined and focused on her career as a figure skater, but all her actions towards that goal made her look childish and annoying for me because of the way she treated those around her, as if they were disposable, and almost as if she was doing them a favor by giving them the time of day, when at the end of the day she was always the one who came back for more because of that feeling of familiarity she didn‚Äôt had before.2. There were too many side characters that I couldn't keep track of, and at some points they stole the limelight in this book, while others became more and more annoying with each intervention (Henry please shut up, you stopped being quirky like 20 chapters ago). Also I don't wanna be like that, but I really feel like the author tried too hard to score those rep points while not even using google translate properly.3. And then the plot dragged and dragged, forever and ever, AMEN.

I‚Äôm a delight.‚Äùmy main problem with the main character:she tried too hard to be grumpy.she was also super overdramatic and she swore to hate hockey players bc of a typical stereotype but one interaction and she realizes she starts to like them. the next thing she does is complain bc she was only willing to like henry. it was infuriating and annoying with how she tried hating all the hockey players. her inner dialogue was so hard to put up with because of the way she simply talked. she was WAY too stubborn for my liking and i did not like it at all. i‚Äôm so glad she gave up that behavior bc i wouldn‚Äôt have been able to stand the book if it continued like that.i thought there were times where i did seem to understand anastasia. she reminded me of monica geller with the way she was described! from her competitive nature to the way she was ‚Äúcompulsively organized‚Äù. it‚Äôs also clear how she cares a lot about the people she loves. however they differed in many different ways with how ‚Äúgrumpy‚Äù she is and her demeanor around new people.a small spoiler for this quote possibly!!‚ÄúIt felt good hearing him make plans for the future, and I could pretend I don‚Äôt know why, but denial is useless at this point. Everything he says makes me melt, and half the time I don‚Äôt know how to react, so I kiss him, then things escalate, and before I know it, I‚Äôm screaming his name and seeing stars.‚Äù‚Äîthis was one of the many examples within this book that shows there‚Äôs no plot, it‚Äôs justsex driven.overall, this book wasso slow. it might seem fast paced with the events, but it slowly eased into a normal routine of them fucking every other chapter. it becomes so boring to read the same damn thing every time. it throws you off at the beginning just as an excuse to slow down the plot and focus on them doing it. however this book was great with keeping everything consistent. the amount of pages for each chapter stayed relatively the same and they didn‚Äôt favor one pov over another!if u saw my reaction while i read this book, you‚Äôd be familiar with these quotes.‚ÄúI swear to God I will leave you in this airport,‚Äù Nate grumbles, slapping my ass, laughing when the noise causes an elderly couple to turn around and look at us, making my cheeks blush.‚Äù‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like he flicks a switch somewhere and suddenly it‚Äôs Niagara Falls between my legs.‚Äùmid way this book became entertaining. not for the plot, which remainedboring and gave us nothing. but i genuinely laughed out loud bc of how cringy the writing was sometimes & how it gave off wattpad vibes. the writing itself was entertaining. there was so much smut and usually i don‚Äôt mind but there was unnecessarily too much in this book. what was the purpose?? i was going to give this book 3 stars at this point. things were looking up and my rating slowly increased. i also liked the banter between the characters! it was pretty enjoyable on my part so there‚Äôs thatusually books that bring comfort involve the found family trope, but it‚Äôs not as present in this book mainly bc it focuses on friendships between the boys and anastasia, but even then it‚Äôs barely talked about there. plus, the main focus was the relationship between nate & anastasia, which in of itself is all abt sex. my favorite part is definitely the cooking lessons that jj and anastasia had together. cutest!!context: literally just gray sweatpants‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in a Maple Hills Titans T-shirt and gray sweats, and I hate myself for being a woman swayed by a man in gray sweatpants. Shit. No, there will be no swaying.‚Äù‚ÄùGray, obviously, because Nathan Hawkins is a man who was most definitely written by a woman.‚Äùi hate nathan with a burning passion. this is the rare occasion where iWANTEDa third act conflict. i usually hate them butthey needed it!!he was below the bare minimum. i truly have no idea how anastasia put up with him. she likes a man who wears gray sweatpants and claims he is written by a woman. i wear gray sweatpants!! does that make me written by a woman? i would hope so but that‚Äôs besides the point.not every person who wears sweatpants immediately makes them written by a woman!spoilers from this point on‚ÄúYou think he‚Äôs going to manipulate her into forgiving him and then she won‚Äôt need you anymore. You like being needed by her. It makes you feel important. You know Aaron hates you and you think he‚Äôs going to keep her away from you. Which just shows you don‚Äôt know how strong she is, or truly understand how much she loves you.‚Äù‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have to scream that I‚Äôm not na√Øve or being manipulated for Nathan to trust my judgment. I shouldn‚Äôt have to beg him to understand that there is a difference between friendship and partnership.‚Äùthese quotes single handedly ruined this book for me and made me hate nathan.nathan desperately needs therapy.i‚Äôm surprised she put up with the attitude that he showed her. i wanted him to be able to work out his feelings on his own so she would never have to put up with a man who cannot communicate his feelings bc communication is key!! instead they got pissed at each other and would put off arguements. then they don‚Äôt see each other for a few days and everything is fixed! i do appreciate the boys knocking some sense into him.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a warm, full feeling in my heart when I‚Äôm around this team. It‚Äôs unfamiliar but familiar at the same time; a contradiction, I know, but so specific that it feels like it was specifically designed for me. It‚Äôs the feeling I didn‚Äôt know I needed until these guys crashed their way into my life three months ago.‚Äùspeaking of the boys:i don‚Äôt see why people like henry.he made a LOT of backhanded comments to everyone and whether or not he can tell if it‚Äôs mean, i‚Äôm surprised they put up with him for so long. i do see that he cares for anastasia but from the beginning he was so blunt. there was ONE scene of henry being kind. he wasn‚Äôt even funny! he just had no filter and just cannot control his honesty. if he was able to control his honesty, i‚Äôd probably like him better.this book was so fast paced for the characters. this all happened within the span of 3 months.3 MONTHS.i get that the idea of the story is supposed to be that they don‚Äôt have any miscommunications and have a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù relationship but i‚Äôve found some problems within this situation. they move way too quickly and the way they address it as ‚Äúwe‚Äôve spent so much time together so we‚Äôre built different‚Äù does not work for me. don‚Äôt get me wrong, they had their cute moments but it wasn‚Äôt enough to suffice for me.they don‚Äôt fight when they‚Äôre ‚Äúfrenemies‚Äù which i do appreciate but it‚Äôs obvious they wanted different things from the beginning. despite nathan knowing what anastasia wanted, they still got jealous whenever one hung out with another person and they didn‚Äôt address it. i feel like they sugarcoated everything and it‚Äôs clear anastasia doesn‚Äôt think on it much simply because she does not know how he feels. i‚Äôve never met a man who‚Äôs happy to be her friend rather than upset that she just wants to be friends.here‚Äôs where the book gets confusing: they are obviously involved with one another but not exactly in a relationship type way. they don‚Äôt even get together until chapter 30. i honestly stopped caring for their relationship bc i was that done with this book. i thought nathan was desperate and i just did not like them together all that much. sure, they can be cute but their whole relationship and personality revolves around fucking one another and when they were away all they would think abt is alone time between them.the supposed ‚Äúplot‚Äù on the back doesn‚Äôt happen until mid way. sure, the ice rink breaks as soon as u jump into the book abt 2 chapters in but the second plot point took too long to happen. i wish it would‚Äôve happened sooner to let the book pick up quicker and become shorter. also i loathe aaron in this book. do i really need to talk abt him? i‚Äôm pretty sure everyone hates him.i personally would not forgive nathan for what he said at the end. that might just be me being petty but i don‚Äôt want to take shit from a man!! i‚Äôd deserve better than someone who can‚Äôt work out their feelings bc i got my own bullshit to deal with. sometimes i couldn‚Äôt see the reasoning behind the things the characters did bc of the way they justified it. sometimes justification works butnot in this case!TW WITHIN THIS BOOK: EATING DISORDERi want to address the eating disorder that is part of the plot within the book but i also don‚Äôt want to be insensitive just in case. i just want to say i‚Äôm glad it was addressed and talk about! i didn‚Äôt like how late they addressed it into the book thoone more thing: i‚Äôm convinced them ‚Äúplaying house‚Äù is another way of them boning and making it their entire personality for the entirety of a few hours. this book really pushed my limits. it also sounds like something roleplay relatedpre-reviewi had a nightmare i rated this book 5 stars. rtc'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'what in the insta-lovey-wattpad-pick-me-shit-every-trope-in-the-fucking-world did I just read?this review is longer than aaron‚Äôs dick yet smaller than his ego.dnf @ chapter 5update:i read wildfire. sometimes i wonder if my lack of brain cells will be my downfall'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Can we take a moment and talk about therealstar of the book?‚ú®Henry‚ú®He was the best character in this whole book, i was practically frothing at the mouth whenever he appeared, I swear if this man was real i would be on my knees.......to propose, get your minds out of the gutter.He literally so cute and rediculously funny, he says what he thinks in the moment and doesn\'t give a damn.For example Nate wanted to talk to Stassie and JJ said lets get some drink (to let them have some alone time) and Henry said why? you have a drink and so do iGod i love that man, and he got like maybe maximum of 20 pages of screen timeLets not forget :"" it was fun staying in Henry\'s room.

Her only chance to become something more than prey is entering the Kejari: a legendary tournament held by the goddess of death herself.But winning won‚Äôt be easy amongst the most vicious warriors from all three vampire houses. To survive, Oraya is forced to make an alliance with a mysterious rival.Everything about Raihn is dangerous. He is a ruthless vampire, an efficient killer, an enemy to her father‚Äôs crown‚Ä¶ and her greatest competition. Yet, what terrifies Oraya most of all is that she finds herself oddly drawn to him.But there‚Äôs no room for compassion in the Kejari. War for the House of Night brews, shattering everything that Oraya thought she knew about her home. And Raihn may understand her more than anyone ‚Äì but their blossoming attraction could be her downfall, in a kingdom where nothing is more deadly than love.The Serpent and the Wings of Night is the first book in a new series of heart-wrenching romance, dark magic, and bloodthirsty intrigue, perfect for fans of From Blood and Ash and A Court of Thorns and Roses.","[{'rating': 3, 'content': 'Hold your horses and fix your faces, I know you are rolling your eyes at me with this 3-star rating.I rolled my eyes. Not at myself, but at the book.It‚Äôs just a matter of opinion and personal taste and my taste wasn‚Äôt taking into consideration when the author decided to write a plot-driven story.I know, the nerve.This is just a me thing. I will never enjoy a story when the plot overtakes the development of the characters, even though I liked the plot in this case.But so much of this story relied on the plot and after a certain point, I wasn‚Äôt a fan. Why should I care for the plot when I hardly grew to care for the characters? They were hardly given any focus.I can admit that the plot was exhilarating and where the strongest focal point lied. I enjoyed the world-building and seeing the stakes that were present in this Hunger Games style battle they were participating in.What made it even better is that this is a world of vampires. With wings. I will always have a thing for those leeches.ü•∞However, I can‚Äôt say I understand the origins of the games and why it needed to take place. Or what made Oraya strong enough to handle these vampires when she‚Äôs a mere ‚Äòhuman‚Äô. Or that I even understood the world. Because what was the conflict exactly between the two clans/factions?What I had a major issue with was the characterisation. It was lacking. There was not a lot of depth to them, which honestly just annoys me. I did not understand what motivated our main character, Oraya. Yes, she wanted to win to become stronger but had we had more information as to why she wanted to save her hometown, I could‚Äôve gotten on board with the plot.I don‚Äôt know if this was intentional, but we really could‚Äôve benefitted from a Raihn POV. Heck, Vincent should‚Äôve had one. That man was a pure mystery and I needed more.I needed layers, backstory, something more that would‚Äôve allowed me to connect to the characters on a deeper level. The hints at background we did get were very few and far in between and we know there‚Äôs more to Oraya than what we have been given.Particularly when it comes to her powers, where she came from, Vincent rescuing her and her upbringing and training after the fact. But we weren‚Äôt privy to that.I would‚Äôve loved to have seen something similar for Raihn in those regards too.This is not to say I didn‚Äôt like them. I liked them. And I liked the romance. There was a particular scene that had me swooning. ü´†ü§§ But it never really stepped into the love territory. There was too much of a disconnect, simply because there was no opportunity given for the reader to really understand the main characters. The plot never allowed for that to happen.I wish we had more of a gradual process of the character development incorporated into the story. And that there was a better balance between the plot and characters.Book Two better deliver since the ending made things interesting. And Oraya better get on board with things asap!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'convinced nothing could top this masterpiece (maybe the sequel)the second i opened up page 1, i couldn‚Äôt put this book down. my eyes were gorilla glued to the pages. i knew i‚Äôd enjoy this book but i didn‚Äôt know i‚Äôd love it to the point of actually considering how i could cement it into my brain, skin, and body. üò§this was the hunger games meets Underworld. from the world building to the lush writing, nothing was a miss to my eyes. from characters i‚Äôd literally move continents for to a slow burning romance that ached me to the core. the plot was giving as much as the romance. and we got enough of both.ü´†oraya! female rage incarnated to the max. she‚Äôs so effortlessly fierce, badass, and strong. usually battle/fight scenes bore me but it‚Äôs the way i couldn‚Äôt get enough of it when she was involved. this book is all in her pov and it was the best decision. she‚Äôs not only my favorite character in this series but one of all time now. she deserves the world and i‚Äôll gladly kneel before her üßéüèª\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏èraihn. my man (that doesn‚Äôt know he‚Äôs my man yet) god i love his personality. he‚Äôs so babygirl. he‚Äôs so charming. but he has a lot of growing on me to do which i‚Äôm hoping to get in the sequel.üßéüèª\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏èyet i still want him till i am diagnosed with SEVERE spine and back problems ü•∞but i gotta say, my favorite part about this book was the plot over the romance. i was so entranced in the writing and world building that i could clearly imagine every corner, inch, and cobblestone of this world and its kingdoms. and gahhh damn those last 30 pages‚Ä¶you could have a gun to my head and i wouldn‚Äôt have guessed the way things ended. i was shocked to say the least. my brain must have paralyzed entirely as some point. i lost all mobile functionality. i finished this book breathing hard and staring at the walls for like 20 minutes processing the intense shit i just read. ü§Øcarissa broadbent count your fucking days because my therapist and lawyer say i‚Äôm entitled to emotional compensation, they‚Äôll be in contact‚Ä¶'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""sarah janet walked so this brutal shit could runi've had a hard time finding a fantasy romance to satisfy me. they often lack proper world building and fantasy elements or the relationships feel rushed and unjustified. and let's be honest, i'm a notoriously picky bitch.but this book was pretty satisfying on all fronts. a fairly complex political system with vampires being the ruling class. in- fighting amongst vampire factions. a hunger games-esque competition. relentless brutality. and a compelling romantic relationship that i couldn't help but root for. oh and don't let me forget about the complex father-daughter relationship!!!my only complaint is that i wish we had a little info dumping early on. weird to ask for, but i wanted to better understand the reason for the Hiaj/Rishan conflict. i get that bloodthirsty power thirsty beasts can just be mean to be mean but i think it would have helped me to understand the stakes more if we knew more about the differences between factions/species.otherwise? fantastic. and i'll be picking up the sequel when it comes out :)""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'My bloody, angsty, stabby, spicy book child is now in the world!I am so so excited to share this book with you officially, and I hope that you have as much fun reading it as I had writing it.

Her being the most insensitive unapologetic person was the BEST thing I swear she had me cackling so loudddd-What I adored most about her character was that she reciprocated the love and compassion perfectly. She didn‚Äôt just make the guy do all the work after they both accepted that they loved/cared for each other. Their romance was so balanced and delicately handled and I JUST LOVE IT OKAYI liked that she was trained to withstand and protect herself from the brutality of where she was living but I would‚Äôve enjoyed it better if we got to see her train, fall and repeat until she became who she was at the start of the book.

I enjoyed it but it just wasn't that wowing or maybe I was just very hyped to start it. I feel like Carissa's writing is really good, it is engaging because I read it very fast, and it kept me very engaged. I also think setting this book and the writing in it to the standard of a high fantasy novel is not right because its a totally different think, I think that's why most people end up disliking romantasy but besides that I would say that when it came to the plot it was very interesting, I just dont think that the characters were that captivating. I think the writing really carried the book for me because it easily brought out the enjoyment factor.‚ÄúI would beg,‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúFor you, I would. You have fucking destroyed me, Oraya. Do you know that?‚ÄùOraya, our fmc definitely has potential to be a badass warrior and honestly I did like her but there was something keeping me away from truly enjoying her pov its not feeling disconnected but rather how lacking her character felt in terms of development, we also didn't really get to see any flashbacks but I liked her as a warrior and a human trying to survive in a vampiric world.Raihn, our MMC, and uhhh he was okayyy, again it's not that I didn't like him, His banter with Oraya was very fun to read and he was very charming but he didnt really intrigue me enough and honestly I wasm't really interested in reading about him but I feel like my feeling might change after the way this book ended. Also I soooo wanted Mische's story with septimus idk why I just did.‚ÄúDo you want to change this world, little serpent? Then climb your cage until you are so high no one can catch you.

Her with Raihn was just okayy, I liked the forbidden aspect but still it was just very lacking, I loved their bickering but I just didn't like Raihn FOR her, he felt very ehh but I am hoping that he improves because im fairly certain that he is the endgame for her, even the spicy scene felt okay because I just didn't really feel the chemistry between them.‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be so quick to throw away your humanity, Oraya,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou might find you miss it once it‚Äôs gone.‚ÄùThe plot is easily this books saving grace because I was hooked with the trials and with the way everything was going and I loved how she listened to Vincent but also the ending with the plot twist I was not expecting and I LOVED it, it makes me so excited to read it!! I got the book so I am even more excited. I think with the way it ended book 2 has a lot of potential for this series and honestly can we talk about theStandalonesin this series?? masterpieces! I loved both slaying the vampire conqueror and six scorched roses so hoping that book 2 improves as well.Overall, it could be better but I enjoyed it!~~~I can't believe I haven't read this yet.

All she has to do is defeat the vampire warriors of the three houses; where she meetsRaihn, our MMCand of course a vampire. Everything about him alludes power, charm, and enemy to the king. As their paths collide and an alliance is formed complications arise.Honestly, I loved every minute of it and every page of it. From the first chapter till the last one, it stayedconsistent, intense and action packed.It\'s paced in a balanced manner- where things need to be fast, it is fast and where things need to be slow, it is slow. The world building is so interesting. And honesty I was glad that for a change the word ""fae"" wasn\'t mentioned, cause lately everything has been fae and it\'s started to grow old.Not that I\'ll stop reading them.The author wrote this in such an immaculate manner, I was fully immersed.

Oraya and Raihn bring life to the book. Tho they\'re very similar to the dynamic of Feyre and Rhysand, it is still fun and lively. I would say thatOrayais more of an original personality, cause her zeal and her humanity is what makes her stand out. She has got tricks up her sleeve as well and radiates grump energy tbh lol.Raihn\'spersonality, similar to Rhysand. I love Rhysand, I love Raihn too. There are a lot of other similarities between the two- the way they carry themselves, the wings, the banter and their motives. Tho he may not sound original, he has the potential to win you over and trust me, he will.Septimus is an interesting character and pretty sure we\'re going to see more of him.

This. Book. Is. AMAZING! And that\'s high praise coming from me. I read a decent amount of fantasy, but most of the time, I\'m unimpressed either by the story, the characters, or the writing. But this captivated me from the first page and kept me enthralled till the end. Carissa Broadbent is a talented writer and I will be reading her entire backlog.This book has been on my radar since it was published, but I decided to wait because, honestly, I just didn\'t believe all the hype. I\'m annoyed I waited so long to read it, but at the same time, I\'m glad because book 2 is out now so I don\'t have to spend months dealing with the emotional damage from that ending!So what did I love?This vampire world.I\'ve mostly read about vampires in a contemporary setting or historical time period, so to read about them in a true fantasy world was interesting. The tone of this story is very dark and gritty, which emulates the ways of the brutal vampiric society. Vampires only respond to strength, so there\'s constant bloodshed. If you\'re not a born vampire (turned vampire or human) you are considered less than, meaning this world is extremely dangerous and most live under the constant threat of abuse and death.Oraya is a refreshingly fantastic FMC and quite the paradox.She is a girl between worlds. A human raised by the Nightborn vampire king, who taught her how to protect herself in a world designed to kill her. She longs to be one of them, to be their equal, but she can\'t quite stomach what they truly are. Yet she is not quite human either, since they are no more than helpless livestock in this world and she is anything but helpless. Oraya has complex thoughts and feelings regarding her place in this world, and it was fascinating watching her struggle through this.Oraya is a total badass.Since she is a human in a vampire world, her father taught her from a young age how to protect herself - mentally, emotionally, and physically. She\'s been training with him for years, growing stronger, learning how to fight, and preparing for the Kejari tournament, all with the hope that she will win and be granted a single wish from the goddess, Nyaxia - the goddess of vampires. Also, without her father knowing, she sneaks off at night to the \'protected\' human districts to hunt down rogue vampires looking for easy prey. I loved this little act of defiance against vampires and that she chooses to protect the helpless. Made me respect the hell out of her even more.She\'s also incredibly smart, resourceful, determined, and persistent. Even though she was raised in a cold, heartless place, she still has her humanity and a hidden compassion for others. She also radiates big grump energy because doesn\'t trust anyone except her father and is always serious and on edge, so watching her build relationships was entertaining. I think she\'s one of my favorite MCs of all time.Daddy Vincent aka King of the Nightborn vampires.I have so many complicated feelings about this man because just like his adopted daughter, this man is a walking paradox. On one hand, he is the Nightborn king - ruthless, powerful, cunning, and cruel. But on the other hand, he took in a small human child and raised her as his own. And as Oraya\'s father, he would soften and let love and concern for her shine through. Plus, he calls Oraya his little serpent and always says it with such a tone of endearment. ü•∫ He\'s a savage king where his one and only weakness is his daughter. (I mean, I know he\'s morally grey AF and I know I shouldn\'t love him, but I totally do.) Oraya truly believes he loves her. But after everything that happens and from what we discover at the end, there\'s just so many questions that leave me (and Oraya) wondering, was it really love? And I think this is the beauty of his character and this relationship. The \'love\' isn\'t clear, which makes it all much more interesting.Raihn.He\'s a mysterious, powerful vampire and Oraya\'s greatest threat in the competition. It takes them a while to warm up to each other, but once they do, she starts to see more vulnerable sides to him - full of pain and love. What I admire most about Raihn is that even though he\'s had a difficult life and has the ability to abuse his power (just like others abused him), he\'s determined to make life better for others. I don\'t mean he\'s a softie. No, he still kills and is extremely deadly. But the way he takes care of those he loves - Mische and eventually, Oraya - is everything. He may play the role of a brute, but deep down, he is anything but that. If you\'re an ACOTAR fan, I think you\'ll see a few similarities between Raihn and Rhysand. They\'re both charming, sexy, persistent, winged, hard to read, and easily slips into different roles/characters. And if you love Rhysand, you\'ll fall in love with Raihn.The enemies-to-lovers / star-crossed romance.I mean, I COME ON! How could you not be into this?! They\'re opponents in a freaking death competition and from rival vampire houses! There\'s so much tension and underlying hatred my skin was boiling. The romance is soooooooo slow, but the progression from enemies to allies to friends to lovers was so natural and realistic. Oraya doesn\'t EVER give her trust or love to anyone except her father, so it takes a lot of time, patience, and reassurances for Raihn to make Oraya truly believe that she\'s safe with him. Watching her finally open up and trust was so beautiful. And while there\'s only three-ish spicy scenes, they were well worth the wait!Also, I really appreciated how Oraya\'s past sexual trauma was handled. It was well done.Mische is a delight.I love her. I want to be her best friend. She is just such a joyful ball of sunshine in this dark story, but also a badass vampire with magic. I love her individual relationships with Raihn and Oraya, and cannot wait to see how things pan out for her in future books. Maybe she\'ll even get her own story, since apparently they\'re going to be six books total in the series that are split into 3 duologies??? üëÄThe tournament as a whole and the individual trials were so interesting.While some fantasy stories with action can bore me to death, this never lost my attention. Each scene is described in a way that makes you feel as if you are there experiencing it yourself. I was constantly at the edge of my seat, eager to find out what would happen next. It was absolutely gory and I fucking loved it. Plus, I thought it was interesting that the trials were based on the goddess Nyaxia\'s own story, so it only enhanced the world-building.The shocking ending.I don\'t really know what I expected, but THAT was not it. I wasn\'t surprised by who won, but everything that happened after. I mean, the plot twists and reveals just kept coming and didn\'t stop! Bravo, Carissa Broadbent, for this fantastic ending! I cannot wait to read the next book!With everything I loved about The Serpent and the Wings of Night, there was only one thing that bothered me.Raihn repeatedly says, ""There she is,"" to Oraya and it becomes a sort of catch phrase.He says it whenever he wants her to know he really \'sees\' her and her strength/determination/perseverance. I like that he says this, but it was used too frequently and in such a short span of time that it felt like overkill and became a bit cheesy.Overall,The Serpent and the Wings of Nightis a phenomenal first book in The Crowns of Nyaxia series! I\'m so captivated by the characters, the romance, this dark fantasy world, and the shocking ending that I will immediately be reading Book 2: The Ashes and the Star Cursed King.-Crowns of Nyaxia Series:1.The Serpent and The Wings of Night: 4.75 ‚≠êÔ∏è1.5Six Scorched Roses: 4.5 ‚≠êÔ∏è2.The Ashes and the Star-Cursed King: 3.5 ‚≠êÔ∏è-Favorite Quotes:I loved it - really, truly loved it - when they underestimated me._______""Death isn\'t frightening when weighed against an insignificant existence.""_______""Don\'t be so quick to throw away your humanity, Oraya.

But I can't help feeling grumpy that I didn't love it as thoroughly as I thought I would.On the surface, this should've been a 5-star read for me. When you put together things like adopted human daughter of a vampire king, a legendary tournament where only one can survive, and a forbidden attraction between two contestants‚Äîone human and one vampire‚Äîit all sounds so good. If ever there was something right up my alley, this would be it. So what's my problem? Honestly, I'm still trying to figure that out.I think part of the issue for me was that there was so much fighting and not enough characterization. The tournament has five parts and we are treated to detailed descriptions of every play-by-play, along with countless wounds and gashes and blood galore. In fact, the sheer amount of injuries in here is quite eyebrow-raising considering we only follow a few characters. And since everyone heals quickly and gets injured again immediately, I soon lost track of it all.I also found Oraya to be rather one-dimensional. I'm all for my female characters to be badass, but what is her personality other than fight first and talk later? Sure, she is distrusting and stab-happy, but that doesn't paint a picture of a real person to me. And she keeps mentioning how vampires don't have a sense of humor, but it's hard for me to see her sense of humor when she just keeps stabbing everyone.Not really connecting with Oraya made it hard for me to see what Raihn saw in her, which in turn made it hard for me to understand the romance in here. It seems like Oraya disliked Raihn for a long time, and then all of a sudden, she likes him. And Raihn was attracted to her for no reason I could discern other than she keeps stabbing him.Each of these complaints, while small on their own, just added to the feeling that the whole thing wasn't really gelling together for me. Whenever I read a story, I want that immersive experience, and this is especially true with fantasy. It's a chance to escape the real world and wholly commit myself to another. So it's always a bit disappointing when I don't get that, and it feels like I'm just reading words on a page, however good they may be.And make no mistake, this is a well-written fantasy with a lot of potential and a lot of depth. There is a rich world here (and I realized halfway through there is a glossary to help me keep it all straight). And the book did eventually grab me, with the last hundred pages being so full of revelations and surprises, I think my mouth was hanging open the whole time. It finally became as exciting and riveting as I'd hoped for.Still, I can't help but wish the whole book had been more like the finale. Maybe my expectations were just too high here. I wanted to be enthralled and captivated and completely riveted from beginning to end. Instead, I was merely entertained for the majority. I kept waiting for the moment when the story would grab me and not let go, and that didn't really happen until the very end.~~~~~~~~~~~~‚úßConnect with me‚úßInstagram‚úß""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '‚òÜ‚ãÖ‚ãÜ ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ 1st read 2022: 4.25 stars‚òÜ‚ãÖ‚ãÜ ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ2nd read 2023: 4 starsDenial is a river in Egypt.

Carissa Broadbent is coming in hot as the newest queen of romantasy books. üëëDeath isn‚Äôt frightening when weighed against an insignificant existence.SONG:Distraction ‚Äì\xa0Kehlani‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ãÖ‚òæ ‚òΩ‚ãÖ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Ä¢‚åÅPLOT‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ãÖ‚òæ ‚òΩ‚ãÖ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Ä¢Oraya(h) is a human girl who got adopted by Vincent, the Vampire King of House of Night, when she was eight years old. For full context there is also the House of Blood and House of Shadows, but they are irrelevant for now. Every 100 years the Kejari takes place, a tournament, where people all over Obitraes can participate. The contestants have to go trough five trials over the period of four months to win. The winner will get granted one wish by Godess Nyaxia the mother of all vampires. The House of Night is kinda divided into two rival vampire clans: the Hiaj and the Rishan vampires. Basically the whole story of The Serpent and the Wings of Night is that Oraya goes through the trials and has to ally withRaihn(H) to survive the tournament.‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ãÖ‚òæ ‚òΩ‚ãÖ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Ä¢‚åÅREASONS WHY THIS BOOK IS AMAZING‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ãÖ‚òæ ‚òΩ‚ãÖ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Ä¢‚ò™What is hotter than a vampire? A vampire with wings.The world that Carissa Broadbent created with this book is amazing. Vampires always get romanticise in books and I love in this book shows a different side. Vampires are savages, brutal, bloodthirsty and really don‚Äôt give a flying fuck. Humans are pretty much livestock here and it‚Äôs amazing. Savage vampires meet The Hunger Games.‚ò™The plot and magic.Trials and tournaments are probably my favorite plots. Authors can really get creative with coming up with all kind of games and trials and part of the fun is theorizing what could happen next. And the fact that each of the trial in this book was connected to Nyaxia‚Äôs story was so interesting to read. There were so many gods and goddesses mentioned in this book that it will open so many doors for future books in this world and I can‚Äôt wait to learn more. The author said that she plans five more books in this series and I have some theories for what the next book might be about, but for the rest I really have no idea where she wants to take this story and I can‚Äôt wait to learn about it. Watch me being 55 yo and still read this series. ü•∞‚ò™Oraya and Vincent‚Äôs relationship.The king did not know then that his greatest love would also be his ruination‚Äînor that either would come in the form of a tiny, helpless human child.the moment the book started with this quote, I knew their relationship had me by the throat. I have to be honest here and say that Oraya and Vincent‚Äôs relationship was the MVP for me and that‚Äôs not a shade at Oraya and Raihn‚Äôs romance. I‚Äôll come back to that later, but my depraved brain was lowkey shipping Oraya with her father.. yes you‚Äôve read that rightthey are not blood related so where is the problemü§°\xa0there is just something about a ruthless, powerful vampire king that takes in a human stray from the street that is so good ü§å\xa0it was giving Kaname x Yuki (Vampire Knight) and Thanos x Gamorra (Marvel) vibes‚ÄúYou do not have to do this, my little serpent,‚Äù he said softly. ‚ÄúI realize only now that perhaps I never told you that.‚ÄùHE CALLS HER HIS LITTLE SERPENT DLSFJSDLFJS how can you expect me not to fall for this?! üò©\xa0Vincent was such an interesting character to me .. his duality was so hot. On one hand he is this savage king who rules with an iron fist and has no problem burning a city with 500k men, women, children, human or vampires to the ground. On the other hand he is anurturingfather where his one and only weakness is his little serpent.Vincent, my father, loved me above all. But Vincent, the Nightborn King, was too ruthless to allow the slightest challenge, love or no.The complexity of their relationship spoke to me. Vincent was definitely the kind of father that raised Oraya with tough love. He protected her, he taught her how to fight, he taught her how to be hard, he taught her how to be efficient, he taught her how to be ruthless, but most importantly he taught her how to survive in this cruel world of predators. He took away part of her humanity. But underneath all the hard exterior he is such a softie for his little serpent. Every time Oraya barely survived one of the trials and her seeing Vincent reactions to it.. my heart üò≠For me, Vincent was that person. Even when I had no one else, I had him, and I knew beyond any doubt in this world or the next that he would do literally anything for me.Part of Oraya‚Äôs journey was realizing that even though she loved Vincent, she knows he is not a good man. These conflicting feelings made the story more compelling.‚ÄúDo you want to change this world, little serpent? Then climb your cage until you are so high no one can catch you. Break its bars and make them your weapons. Nothing is sharper. I know because I did it.‚ÄùDid I mentioned that Vincent won the Kejari 200 years ago and gained enough power to become the Nightshade king? HE IS SO HOOOT I CAN‚ÄôT üò≠\xa0he isn‚Äôt even a morally grey characters, he has straight out villain traits and committed so many crimes, but do I give a fuck? Clearly not cause I love him the most ü•∫üëâüëà‚ÄúI can‚Äôt take credit for everything that you‚Äôve become, Oraya. Even if sometimes I wish I could. But if I‚Äôm responsible for just one small piece of that, it will have been the greatest accomplishment of my life.‚ÄùI WANT TO DIIIEEEEEE üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ LADFJALSKF üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ idk what to do with this unhealthy obsession of mine with this side character like what the hell is this .. every time Vincent opens his mouth I either want to die or want to fuck him there is no in between üòîMiss Broadbent I need to have a word with you asap! I‚Äôm still having a mental breakdown of the last 20% of this book and how dare you for what you did‚Ä¶‚ò™Oraya.I really liked Oraya as the female main character. Even though her character isn‚Äôt very original, since she has many of the typical fantasy protagonist traits such as chosen one, weak human that turns powerful, I still like how she questions her own humanity despite being still human. Oraya had the chance to turn her back on this vampire world and find a safe place among the humans, but I love how she say that she rather stays in this place and make a change than being ignorant and safe.‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be so quick to throw away your humanity, Oraya,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou might find you miss it once it‚Äôs gone.‚ÄùHer quest for power is admirable and I want to see more what her vision is for Obitraes is. It feels like this cruel world can‚Äôt sink any lower with all the war that has been raging on for quite some time and I‚Äôm curious to see how Oraya will handle all the problems.‚ò™Oraya and Raihn romance.Oraya and Raihn have kind of a reverse grumpy-sunshine situation where Raihn is not really a sunshine, but compare to grumpy paranoid Oraya .. you should say he is. While I do love a good reverse grumpy-sunshine dynamic it took me a while to warm up to their relationshipdue to my inability to stop shipping Oraya with her father until I had to realize that this will never happenand they worked well together. I think my problem with Raihn‚Äôs character is that he was so nice and normal compared to all the other vampires? In a world full of backstabbing, cunning and ruthless killers .. Raihn seemed dare I say boring in comparison. I needed more angst, more drama, more backstabbing between the couple and the second half gave that to me.‚ÄúAre you going to kill me, Oraya?‚Äù‚ÄúNot tonight.‚Äù‚ÄúYou might destroy me anyway.‚ÄùAnother thing that works in Raihn and Oraya‚Äôs favor is star crossed of romance of two rival clans. Their romance is very slowburn, but I‚Äôm happy to report that the smut scenes that we got where pretty good. My favorite was the biting scene that was üî•‚ÄúWe‚Äôll probably die tomorrow,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúShow me something worth living for.‚Äù‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ãÖ‚òæ ‚òΩ‚ãÖ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Ä¢‚åÅWHY NOT 5 STARS‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ãÖ‚òæ ‚òΩ‚ãÖ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Ä¢‚ò™\xa0There was quite a lot of tell and no show in this book that bothered me a bit. If you didn‚Äôt know already Vincent is my fav character from this book, but it was always told to the reader how powerful he is and how he killed so many people and how he did all these horrible things, but I would have loved to see it actually happening.Maybe then I would have put him less on a pedestrial but ahahahah who are we kidding I would have been even more obsessed ü•¥. Even with Raihn and Oraya‚Äôs training in between the trials, it was always tell, but I would have loved to see more of them fighting and getting stronger on page.‚ò™\xa0This is such a dumb thing to be petty about, but I HATE FANTASY NAMES AND PLACES. THEY GIVE ME A HEADACHE. It takes me my last remaining 3 brain cells to even remember half of the names in this book and only because Raihn is actually one of the easiest one. But then there is Nyaxia, Atroxus, some guy‚Äôs name that reminds me of Salamander, Sivrinaj, Ministaer, Jesmine, Nessanyn, Cairis etc. It took me 10 minutes to look up all these names, cause I only remembered like the first two letters üíÄüíÄ‚ò™\xa0as I mentioned above, it took me a bit to warm up to Raihn. Not because he is not likable or a bad developed romance or anything, but I was too busy shipping two other characters that I had no business shipping that whenever Raihn and Oraya interacted.. I was like ‚Äúokay cute she‚Äôs warming up to him whatever, give me another father daughter scene!!‚Äù but I think that‚Äôs a me problem, since I don‚Äôt think I saw any other reviews who had any problem with him. Something happens toward the end that as long as I live I willneverforgive Raihn for, but at the same time it made his character so much more interesting and complex.‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ãÖ‚òæ ‚òΩ‚ãÖ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Ä¢‚åÅCONCLUSION‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ãÖ‚òæ ‚òΩ‚ãÖ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Ä¢Before reading The Serpent and the Wings of Night I was very impressed with the 4.54 rating this book has because it‚Äôs so rare that the first book in a series gets rated so high, but after reading it.. I can‚Äôt lie, it deserves it. This series will be the next most popular romantasy series in the future and it should be! I wish more people will read this book, because the plot is amazing, it‚Äôs very fast paced, it has intriguing characters and slowburn romance.‚îç‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ¬ª‚Ä¢¬ª ¬´‚Ä¢¬´‚îÅ‚îëCROWNS OF NYAXIA SERIES#1The Serpent and the Wings of Night‚Äì 4 stars#2 The Ashes and the Star-Cursed King ‚Äì 2.75 sstars#3 tbd ‚Äì tbr#4 tbd ‚Äì tbr#5 tbd ‚Äì tbr#6 tbd ‚Äì tbr‚îï‚îÅ¬ª‚Ä¢¬ª ¬´‚Ä¢¬´‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îô'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""You know a series has its fangs in you when you start ghosting peeps to binge-read.Oraya > Feyre‚†ÄRaihn > Rhysand‚†ÄI said what I said.

It made me appreciate Carissa's gorgeous writing even more. ü•∞_______________________The king did not know then that his greatest love would also be his ruination‚Äî nor that either would come in the form of a tiny, helpless human child.Oraya is a human who was saved and raised by Vincent, the Hiaj vampire king after her family was killed and her house destroyed in a rebel attack when she was a little girl. Vincent raised her as if she was his daughter, teaching her how to fight, survive, and kill, and getting her ready to enter the Kejari. Once in a century, the Kejari is held as a tribute to Nyaxia, the Goddess of the night. Dozens of vampires enter the tournament, but only one will survive and be crowned victor, gaining one favor from the goddess herself. Oraya is counting on that favor to become strong enough to finally avenge her human family and help protect the humans living among vampires, but surviving in a tournament designed to kill vampires is no easy task when you are a human. Oraya will find herself forced to find an ally, even though she was taught never ever to trust a vampire.But maybe this place made all of us that way. Taught us to hide love in sharp edges.Vincent had carved these lessons into me. Never trust. Never yield. Always guard your heart.The world-building is complex enough to be very interesting and complete,and the information is not dumped on the readers but rather integrated seamlessly into conversations and descriptions. Obitraes is a ruthless realm, full of vampires fighting and destroying each other to gain more power. To them, humans are no more than cattle, blood bags that they can use as they see fit and discard with no consequence. Humans are supposed to be protected in their district, but Oraya knows that this ‚Äúprotection‚Äù they are under isn‚Äôt worth anything. Every description portrays this dark and desolate world Oraya lives in, and we can feel her despair and anger at her situation and the humans' fate.Politics take a lot of room in the plottoo, so here is a little summary of the political situation in Obitraes:-\tThere are three vampire Houses: the House of Night, the House of Shadow, and the House of Blood (nobody likes the House of Blood though).-\tVincent is the king of the House of Night, but in that house, two factions have been at war for centuries: the Hiaj and the Rishan (Vincent is Hiaj).The descriptions were great and created a dark atmosphere. We could see how poorly humans are treated, how little they‚Äôre worth, and how hopeless some of them are. It‚Äôs not as bloody or gory as Empire of the Vampire, but there is a similarly dark and gloomy vibe to the book that I enjoyed. The author has a gorgeous way of writing her characters and the story, making it a dark and immersive journey.He was not the physically strongest vampire. He was not the fiercest warrior nor the wisest sage. But they said he was blessed by the goddess Nyaxia herself, and anyone who had ever met him would swear it to be true. Power seeped from his every pore, and death stained his every breath.‚ÄúYou cannot accomplish anything in this world without power,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd power requires sacrifice, focus, and ruthlessness.‚ÄùVincent is the Hiaj king of the House of Night. He is cold and ruthless, but he has a soft spot for his adoptive daughter, Oraya.He made it his mission to teach her everything he knows about combat, but even though we can see that he cares for her in his way, their relationship is very complicated. There is no such thing as saying to someone that you care for them in the world they live in, and no such thing as physical affection or real trust. Oraya knows that Vincent loves her, but she also knows that he‚Äôs the only one she is safe with and that she must always remain vigilant, even in the castle. She also comes to realize that Vincent might be more vicious than she thought, but she also knows that being King of the Vampires is no easy task, and it comes with tough choices. As the book progresses, there are a lot of mixed feelings between the two of them, but I really like their complex dynamic. I also love that Vincent was more than just a brutal vampire looking to use anyone and everyone, he does truly care about Oraya and shows it in his way, although that does not excuse some of the decisions he made. It would be interesting to get a prequel book about him.This struck me, strange and confusing. My humanness had been the reason why I‚Äôd spent a lifetime dimming myself. For these people, it was the reason they burned brighterOraya was raised in this dark and vicious world, surrounded by predators, and because of her unusual upbringing, she does not consider herself fully human, but she also knows that she is not a vampire.She falls somewhere in between the two groups. I said that she is ruthless and good at killing but we can also see a softer side of her that emerges as she spends more time with vampires that are not evil and trying to kill her, and as she spends time just mingling with humans instead of trying to protect them from afar. She comes to realize that she is human just as they are, despite what she or Vincent might think, and that all the training and brutality in the world will not change that fact.Death isn‚Äôt frightening when weighed against an insignificant existence.‚ÄùAn insignificant existence. Those words hit me unexpectedly hard. Because what existence was more insignificant than this? Living in constant fear, hobbled by my own blood and my own human weakness? I could never be anything this way, fighting so hard to survive that I could never do anything.I like the complexity and grayness of Broadbent‚Äôs characters.The ‚Äúgood‚Äù characters often have to do questionable things for the greater good, or simply to survive, and the ‚Äúevil‚Äù ones are often much more complex than just being evil and power-hungry. They have depth and layers, and I love how she finds a way to ‚Äúhumanize‚Äù them, even if it‚Äôs only a little bit. The characters are flawed and make mistakes or bad choices, but it makes them so much more relatable. I fell in love with her cast in the War of Lost Heart series, and I fell in love with the characters in The Serpent and the Wings of Night too. I need more of them.You ready?I asked him.He was already lifting his sword.Always.‚ÄúGive me one honest thing, Raihn Ashraj.‚ÄùAfter a long moment of silence, he finally spoke. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve lived through some injustices in the last couple of centuries. Seen some fucking travesties. But one of the biggest, Oraya, is that anyone taught you that you should become anything other than exactly what you are.‚ÄùRaihn Ashraj is another contestant in the Kejari.He appears to be a strong and powerful brute at first, but it‚Äôs clear that there is much more to him than meets the eye. He‚Äôs witty and seems to be more human than the rest of the vampires. He doesn‚Äôt see humans as walking blood-bags, and he even seems to have feelings besides hunger for blood, sex, and violence. He‚Äôs trying to show Oraya that although most of the vampires are vicious predators, not all of them are, and he‚Äôs trying to prove to her that she can trust him not to hurt her.His personality paired with Oraya‚Äôs stern and rude behavior was so funny at first, but the real magic happened when they were forced to work together and spend more time together‚Ä¶The banter and the fragile trust between them were everything. Their relationship is a very slow burn, built on shaky foundations, and they are both competing in a tournament where there can only be one winner, hence the ‚Äúdoomed romance‚Äù checkmark at the beginning of the review, but there is hope for a happy ending for them later in the series. There is sexual tension between them and even some smut near the end, but while there is hope for a happy ending, they are not close to being there yet!And then I realized. I realized that fear, when embraced, hardens and sharpens.That it becomes rage.That it becomes power.I would not die here.I let my fury explode.I let it spill out through my mouth and my eyes and my fingers and the tips of my hair. I let it erupt all the way to the sky‚Äî past the stars, the moon, reaching for Nyaxia herself.The ending. OMG.The last 20% of the book was just this crazy roller coaster of emotions, betrayal, plot twists, and shocking revelations. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE where the relationship between Raihn and Oraya is heading, and the angst-lover in me is hysterically clapping her hands because there is so much potential for an epic sequel!I highly recommend this book if you are looking for a darker fantasy adventure, full of deadly trials, murders, and vicious vampires, with a dash of dry banter, a great slow-burn between kinda-enemies-now-forced-to-be-allies, and very well-developed and layered characters.Once again, Ms. Broadbent delivered an amazing book!After all, vampires know better than anyone how important it is to protect their hearts.And love, understand, is sharper than any stake.Follow me on InstagramüôÇ""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""‚ú∞‚ãÜ‚òæ ‚ãÜ The Serpent and the Wings of Night ‚≠ë‚òΩ ‚úßÀñ¬∞.

I\'m wondering if this author has all her friends writing reviews for her work because her other popular and largely lauded bookDaughter of No Worldswas also a huge bust for me.THE GOOD1) Lots and lots of potential here. Books featuring vampires that don\'t sparkle but rather are lethal, deadly, and batshit crazy should automatically be given a chance here.We had some crazy House of Vampires political scheming led by Vincent, our scary vampire who\'s also a gruff softie toward Oraya. Repressed houses biding their time, mysterious vampires named Raihn who, of course, have a slowish-burn romance...we\'ve got it all.2) The end reveals were pretty cool. I didn\'t see all that coming.THE BAD1) Enormous amounts of ""tell, not show."" We\'re told that Vincent is all powerful and ruthless and wipes out thousands of people/vampires at a thought. We\'re told that Oraya hunts vampires in the human villages due to some deeper, repressed reason. We\'re told that the trials are a big deal for vampires everywhere. We\'re told that the various lines of vampire Houses are feuding and unstable and deadly. We\'re told that vampire lines have various powers. We\'re told that, despite being human, Oraya seems to harbor powers of her own and is somehow allowed to participate in a vampire tournament. Riiight. To all of it.2) Variations of the word ""fuck"" were used what felt like once or twice a page to the point where it seemed juvenile and bro-ish. It also made the book seem like the setting should be a paranormal urban fantasy with the modern language and settings around us versus dealing with centuries old vampires. I imagine this was all in an attempt to make the book New Adult vs. Young Adult...but there\'s much more to Adult or New Adult books than merely using the word ""fuck"" profusely.FINAL THOUGHTSI skimmed this bookliberally.UnlikeThe Hunger Games,which sets up the characters and dystopian setting well into the exposition before launching the Games for the core of the book, we\'re entering the Kejari tournament so, so soon before I could event have time to understand Oraya, the world she was living in, the threat and power of vampires, and what the tournament means to the vampire Houses.In short, I still feel like this author\'s too green in her writing to pull off the level of convincing and complex fantasy story that she\'s trying for here.Having said that...yes, I\'ll probably still skim-read the sequel.'}, {'rating': None, 'content': 'rtc latercurrently running to do a reread of fourth wing before nov 7thü§ç_______________________________________________about to BURNING IT DOWN this one with my favorite girl√∂yk√ºon 1989 release daythe timing couldn‚Äôt be betterü§≠üêçpls see my reputation tv reference'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'WOAH.first of all, i would like to say thank you to the haters. not people hating on me, but my fellow pessimistic unpopular opinion holders.i love you all. you\'re doing the lord\'s work and i am proud to find myself agreeing with you in many a situation.but i loved this.it\'s not perfect, but it sure is fun.the charactersi enjoy the main characters. i mostly like oraya, and i do like raihn and vincent and that sweet vampire girl whose name i\'ve already forgotten (it starts with an m).something i particularly enjoyed was that there are shades of both good and bad in most characters.specifically vincent. it\'s not black and white, but complicated and textured.i also really enjoyed the romance! it felt natural and enjoyable, and the smut scenes were tasteful and sweet.there were also a few cute, almost found family moments that i just ate up.oraya never felt really annoying to me, though my only qualm with her would be the same trap that many fall into in writing the strong, stubborn female characters archetype. there\'s a lot of talk to start abouthardening your heartandnever letting anyone in, etc. and that\'s a real thing of course, but that emotional indifference that gets written in to make a point in these characters isn\'t real because it disappears once she meets someone she fancies or who\'s nice to her. *cough cough* THE ENDINGand that\'s fine--but it\'s not long suffering emotional indifference.the writing/pacingthere were a few of those gimmicky things that make me want to smack my head into a wall: the emphasized height difference, the smelling (no, the fuck he does notsmelllikethe wind), the eyes (HE HAS RED EYES. THAT AREN\'T REALLY RED. JUST HAZEL THAT LOOKS LIKE RED. I GET IT. IT\'S NOT THE CURE TO CANCER, WE CAN MOVE ON), but it was all minor and didn\'t bother me too much.the pacing was fast, and there were a lot of repetitive, adrenaline-rushing, life threatening situations. i swear this girlalmost diedover 8 times. no exaggeration.which, on one hand, gave it a ""rushing through page after page, reading with bated breath"" feeling, but also got old after the third time. she\'s going to survive it, i know that, so why am i here? i\'m not a sadist, i don\'t particularly like watching people almost die for fun.the action scenes happening one after the other after the other also pushed a lot of the world building and that development to the background. hell, a large fact of the plot is precisely the fact that she isn\'t out in the world, and standing by blindly while massive cultural and political shifts happen.i want to add:one of my favorite things in this was the layering of stories. we had the main storyline, but a few other stories were weaved into it. the interludes that caught us up on oraya\'s childhood? love it. the story of nyaxia and learning that as we go through the trials? obsessed.this added a lot of interest and, clearly, is something i loved.originalityis it the most original thing ever? no. it\'s an amalgamation of all the other famous fantasy romances that have come before it. it\'s basically the hunger games but with vampires and magic. some of the characters and their backstories and interactions hark back to what i\'ve read in sarah j maas books.is it the most original thing ever? no. but it\'s not meant to be. it\'s meant to be fun. and it was fun.i think because of this, though, i saw most of it coming. and what i didn\'t guess, i wasn\'t surprised by. so i don\'t quite understand the hype over all the plot twists and turns.anyways, i enjoyed it! i\'d definitely recommend!another thing--maybe this is my unpopular opinion streak refusing to quit,but i liked this and would recommend this more than fourth wing.i know that\'s the book of the summer and everything, but this is a finished duet (that you don\'t have to throw fists to get a copy of) and i prefer how carissa writes characters and character growth.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '""There she is,"" he murmured.started reading this because i want 2023 to be my 2006 2.0, but DAMN, this book is the paper embodiement of thechef\'s kissgesture.üßõ\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏èùóßùóõùóò ùó¶ùóòùó•ùó£ùóòùó°ùóß ùóîùó°ùóó ùóßùóõùóò ùó™ùóúùó°ùóöùó¶ ùó¢ùóô ùó°ùóúùóöùóõùóß - ùóïùó¨ ùóñùóîùó•ùóúùó¶ùó¶ùóî ùóïùó•ùó¢ùóîùóóùóïùóòùó°ùóßüßõ\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è‚òÖùóôùóúùó°ùóîùóü ùó•ùóîùóßùóúùó°ùóöùó¶: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÖùó¨ùóî/ùó°ùóî/ùóî: üÖΩüÖ∞/üÖ∞‚òÖùó¶ùóòùó•ùóúùóòùó¶: ùô≤ùöÅùôæùöÜùôΩ ùôæùôµ ùôΩùöàùô∞ùöáùô∏ùô∞ #ùü∑‚òÖùóöùóòùó°ùó•ùóò ùóîùó°ùóó ùó®ùó°ùóóùóòùó•ùóßùó¢ùó°ùóòùó¶: ùôøùô∞ùöÅùô∞ùôΩùôæùöÅùôºùô∞ùôª ùôµùô∞ùôΩùöÉùô∞ùöÇùöà - ùöÖùô∞ùôºùôøùô∏ùöÅùô¥ùöÇ - ùôøùôΩùöÅ - ùô≤ùô∑ùô∞ùôªùôªùô¥ùôΩùô∂ùô¥ùöÇ‚òÖùó£ùó¢ùó©: ùöÇùô∏ùôΩùô∂ùôªùô¥ ùôøùôæùöÖ - ùôøùô∞ùöÇùöÉ ùöÉùô¥ùôΩùöÇùô¥‚òÖùóßùó•ùó¢ùó£ùóòùó¶: ùôæùöÅùôøùô∑ùô∞ùôΩ ùôµùôºùô≤ - ùôµùô¥ùôºùô∞ùôªùô¥ ùöÖùô∏ùô∂ùô∏ùôªùô∞ùôΩùöÉùô¥ - ùô¥ùôΩùô¥ùôºùô∏ùô¥ùöÇ ùöÉùôæ ùô∞ùôªùôªùô∏ùô¥ùöÇ ùöÉùôæ ùôªùôæùöÖùô¥ùöÅùöÇ - ùöÜùô∑ùôæ ùô≥ùô∏ùô≥ ùöÉùô∑ùô∏ùöÇ ùöÉùôæ ùöàùôæùöÑ - ùöÖùô∞ùôºùôøùô∏ùöÅùô¥ùö°ùô∑ùöÑùôºùô∞ùôΩ (ùô∞ùôΩùô≥ ùô∞ùôªùôª ùô∏ùöÉ ùô≤ùôæùôºùô¥ùöÇ ùöÜùô∏ùöÉùô∑) - ùô∞ùöÅùöÅùô∞ùôΩùô∂ùô¥ùô≥/ùôµùôæùöÅùô≤ùô¥ùô≥ ùôºùô∞ùöÅùöÅùô∏ùô∞ùô∂ùô¥‚òÖùóñùóõùóîùó•ùóîùóñùóßùóòùó•ùó¶: üë•üë•üë•üë•üë•/5‚òÖùó™ùó•ùóúùóßùóúùó°ùóö: ‚úçüèº‚úçüèº‚úçüèº‚úçüèº‚úçüèº/5‚òÖùó£ùóüùó¢ùóß: üìúüìúüìúüìú/5‚òÖùóóùóîùó•ùóû ùóßùóõùóòùó†ùóòùó¶ & ùóßùó•ùóúùóöùóöùóòùó• ùó™ùóîùó•ùó°ùóúùó°ùóöùó¶: üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ/5 (ùöÖùô∏ùôæùôªùô¥ùôΩùô≤ùô¥, ùôºùöÑùöÅùô≥ùô¥ùöÅ ùô∞ùôΩùô≥ ùô∂ùô¥ùôΩùôæùô≤ùô∏ùô≥ùô¥ - ùôªùôæùöÉùöÇ ùôæùôµ ùô±ùôªùôæùôæùô≥ùöà ùô≥ùô¥ùöÉùô∞ùô∏ùôªùöÇ - ùô±ùôªùôæùôæùô≥ùöà...ùô∂ùôæùöÉ ùô∏ùöÉ?

It's book one in the Twisted series but can be read as a standalone.","[{'rating': 3, 'content': '2.75 stars‚ú©‚ãÜwhen i saw that this book has groveling, best friend\'s brother, grumpy/sunshine trope,touch her and i\'ll kill you,i hate everyone but you, a bed-sharing scene, great friend group, and revenge plan (???), i ran so fast and downloaded this real quick. plus, this was being hyped in booktok so might as well read it.i don\'t know why but this book just made me evaluate my life-myself. why do you ask? well,WARNING FOR NON ROMANCE READERS THIS ‚§µ QUOTE IS SPICY OK BYE:""And your pussy is mine. Every inch of you belongs to me, and if you ever let another man touch you- he\'ll end up in pieces, and you\'ll end up tied to my bed and fucked in every hole until my name is the only one you remember. Do you understand?""and at first i was likebecause there\'s things you need to know about me when it comes to my taste for irl men:1.i hate bossy men (pls- i\'m bossy enough as it is)2.toxic? i rebuke this negative energy.3.if you threaten to kill someone if they so much as touch me, therapy or 911?4.if you call me questionable nicknames while having sex, BYE ‚úãand normally, my attitude iswhy do menbut when i read this? i don\'t know myself anymore.i don\'t know what came over me but suddenly i... i um.. that quote above... i LiKe it... so if you know me, no you don\'t.but anyways, going back to the book, i like bothAva(h) andAlex(H) as individual characters. Alex is literally THE definition of a ""fictional character"" because that man is too perfect. basically, he has an IQ of 160, created a software thingy that made him a multimillionaire in high school and became the COO of a real estate agent development or something and has Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory aaand knows Krav Maga AAAND apparently fucks like a porn star? i-that\'s too much perfection ma\'am.i thought Ava and her friend group were also fucking perfect because‚úßBridgetis a literal princess (i\'m not joking)‚úßJulesis jessica rabbit (??) apparently (also, fingers cross for a Jules and Josh book)‚úßStellais this influencer who has 400k followers (???)can i be a part of this fictional friend group pls and thx.i thought the romance was cute in the beginning. usually, in a brother\'s best friend book the girl isalwayspining for the guy while the guy plays a martyr act and becomes a ho to ""push"" the girl away even though he has feelings for her. i\'m glad that\'s not the case here and love the fact that Ava was even a little indifferent towards him at first. and honestly? the smut scenes were kinda hot.overall,this is a very chill book. at least for me. though there are sometw (spoilers) // parental deaths, violence, and child abuse-`,‚úéWHY NOT A HIGHER RATING?‚û≥since uh, when?i really did think the romance and the wholeOperation Emotionthing in the beginning was cute, though, their feelings for one another went from 0 to 100 very fast because Alex really went from not caring that Ava was having a nightmare and acting all cold and ""heartless"" to:""She was mine. She just didn\'t know it yet. I hadn\'t known it myself until I saw her in Colton\'s arms and every instinct raged at me to tear her away. To claim what belonged to me.""i only sensed attraction but i didn\'t get the feeling they were already at the ""she\'s mine, he\'s mine"" stage. one chapter he\'s acting all nonchalant and cold and then in the next he ‚Äúdesires‚Äù her and tells us how badly he wants her and i was like bish when? most of the things he talked about in his pov was about his revenge and a little bit of attraction and with ava\'s pov it was all the operation emotion so them having intense feelings for one another felt kinda quick.their banter was cute the scenes were cute but personally it wasn‚Äôt enough for me to be convinced with his new macho man personality towards her. there wasn‚Äôt enough depth to be honest. like i didnt get the vibes he cared enough for her to call her ‚Äúhis‚Äù because even when he saw her having night terrors in the beginning, i got the vibes he didnt care for her that much and still acted like she was a nuisance.‚û≥telling >>> showingwhen they got together after the first time they had sex there was a lot of telling >>> showing of how they are as a couple and that really bugs me because i\'m the type of person who wants to knoweverything. apparently, they went on dates, alex was suddenly making jokes (?), and they talk through the night but because of the 0 to 100 energy and telling >>> showing, I. STILL. DONT. SEE. THEM. DOING. ALL. THAT. like- what do they even talk about?? and because of this, i wasn\'t really convinced with their ‚Äúlove‚Äù, i just didnt feel it becausei wantedallthe details of how they are as a couple and we didn\'t really get that. once they have sex, most of the romance were written in the inner monologue and it\'s mainly because the last half focused more on the revenge plot. also, even the the grovelling was telling >>> showing. noo, i need more.‚û≥Viciousreincarnatedno, but everyone is right tho- i can definitely see the Vicious in Alex. he likes fucking classy women, has insomnia, and has a revenge plan that includes the heroine. i see no difference.‚û≥OW dramadon\'t worry, it\'s nothing bad but i just find it icky when Alex says that the OW fucks like a porn star or when he was about to go on a ""date"" with the OW (don\'t worry, Ava ruined his plans) or when the OW says this to Ava\'s face:""Alex doesn‚Äôt do either of those things. It‚Äôs well known amongst a certain segment of D.C.‚Äôs female population. No kissing, no face-to-face contact during sex. But he will take you from behind. Choke and fuck you till you see stars. Call you the filthiest names and treat you like a slut.""and then Ava thinks this is hot. personally, if someone says this to my face about the guy i\'m into, i will dip because that\'s an ick for me (please blame my virgo sun and my high standards). you\'re telling me you\'re gonna fuck your girl the same way you\'ve fucked your past hookups? ew no thx.-`,‚úéOVERALL THOUGHTSagain, i thought the romance was cute but it was just ok. the first half was full of cute moments but the last half kinda went down with all the telling >>> showing and i was kinda disappointed with the groveling because of this. like- you\'re just gonna describe how Alex has grovelled for a YEAR in just a page? no ma\'am i want to seeeverything. also, i wanted more scenes of them of how they are as a couple because i just don\'t see Alex being all soft towards Ava.i\'m excited for the next book, aka Bridget\'s book tho! i love the whole princess/bodyguard, forbidden trope. plus, her future mans name isRHYS. that name will forever be sacred so this fictional man who has the privilege of being named after that sacred name better live up to my high af standards.¬ª¬ª‚îÅ‚îÅTwisted series‚îÅ‚îÅ¬´¬´#1: twisted love‚Äî ava x alex ‚û≥2.75 stars#2:twisted games‚Äî bridget x rhys ‚û≥tbr#3:twisted hate‚Äî jules x josh ‚û≥tbr#4:twisted lies‚Äî stella x christian ‚û≥tbr'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'OH BOYYYYYYY! LET\'S GOOOOOOOOLet me hype myself up before I write this one.Another absurdly overhyped book. Everyone tells me this series is good and the later books are better. I don\'t doubt it. I don\'t think Ana is a bad writer, her writing is tolerable and sometimes even enjoyable.Can\'t say the same thing for her characters.NOTHINGin this book or even it\'s cover are congruent. Ana thought it would be fun to attemptevery single trope in the history of the universewith a single story, so you can\'t really tell if this is a romcom, a dark romance or just a joke.You get brother\'s best friend, neighbor, nightmare tropes, who did this to you, my parents died or tried to kill me, ex psycho boyfriend, billionaire CEO who doesn\'t date, grumpy-sunshine, family members who want to steal your money and not a single one of these were executed properly. I honestly felt like I was watching a Spanish telenovela.However, I HAVE TO MENTION thebesttrope of all. The one that brought tears to my eyes. The""I AM NOT LIKE OTHER GUYS!!!!!""but I will talk exactly like Christian Grey every time I get the chance. (so he kind is like one guy)Alex, our main character. CEO, billionaire, with an IQ of 190, hates beer, he is not scared of anything, not even bears. Won\'t kiss during sex, because he hates intimacy. He hates birthdays because everyone has one. He thinks everyone wants him for his magnificent shlong. He has been controlling his family\'s company since he was 14, because he was always knew he would be CEO one day and his uncle would listen to his 14 YEAR OLD DEMANDS. He also slut shames his own friends.IT IS LIKE I AM READING THE WORST TINDER BIO EVER WRITTEN.But yet quite possible to exist out there somewhere, the bio under some guy named Rey who lives in Florida and is a republican who hates women.He also says people feared him at 11, because his parents were killed and he swore revenge. It\'s like a wish version of Batman.Except Batman is actually cool.He apparently had a therapist after his parents died. Someone PLEASE GO TAKE THAT GUY\'S license, because it obviously didn\'t work.Alex, and I quote:""Is not a TOY, so don\'t play with him unless you want to get hurt"" WHAT KIND OF FUCKING TOYS WERE YOU PLAYING WITH WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD YOU PSYCOPATH.But yeah, Alex\'s broken record was to please: ""stop trying to humanize me, I am your bad guy."" He also guarantees people that""biological reactions can be mastered""Good fucking luck next time you have to sneeze BRO. Hope you don\'t fucking explodeOur female main character was the SUNSHINE OF THE PARTY! The most giggly adorable girl who apparently ""fucks like a porn star"" (this author had a really really really weird obsession with porn stars since she mentioned them not once, but four times during her entire book)Our FMC had her own mother try to drown her, then proceeded to kill herself from guilt. Her ex cheated on her multiple times, abused her physically BUT SHE IS SUUUUUUUUUCH A SUNSHINE and all she needs is to get dicked down to still see the good in people. Fuck therapy.It\'s so hilarious that in the desperate need to make this book a tiktok sensation... she added so many things that absolutely don\'t go together for the sake of hype, but guess what? Tiktok is that predictable.She succeeded.Now, moving on to the sex scenes. Probably the most hilarious thing I have ever read in my life. Christian Grey comparison aside, we get the most AMAZING LINES I HAVE EVER READ in my book blogger career.""I am turning you into my fuck doll""(?????????????? I mean if you want herunresponsive... I have something to tell ya...We might need to call you a new therapist, or maybe get you into jail.I haven\'t decided yet.)He literally describes the view of her on his bed as a:""sacrificial virgin waiting defilement""Every time she puts her hand on his dick, she""can feel the power it emanates"".I mean, by all means, put a cape on it and give it a marvel contract.Well, anyways... a bunch of stupid things happen, this book is MASSIVELY long for some UNKNOWN reason, just like Alex\'s penis. Near the end, our HEROOOOO threatens the mean girl to destroy HER company, because he has that sort of power, if she doesn\'t tell him where his girlfriend is. It has the same energy as:""my daddy is a lawyer""in third grade.It pains me to say this entire review constitutes of quotes from this book, because honestly? It\'s all I needed. It\'s embarrassing enough on it\'s own. I hardly did any work here.Maybe I will read the next one since you guys love it so much, let\'s see.Anyways, my stomach hurts from laughing.*wipes sweat off brows*'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'the red in the flag that is alex volkov is from all my brain cells he has murdered, and the blood of the people he has actually murdered üòçeverybody who said he begged and grovelled for a year LIED, i hope you guys have to wear wet socks for the rest of ur lives ü§† he spends half a year preparing to stalk ava, and then does that for the next half. no tears were shed on his end, i demand my money back.i wanted to be nice to this book just because of howunintentionally hilarious and satiricalit was, but then hesangand all of that was out the window.i respectfully don\'t care enough about the plot to go into details about it, but if you must know, it was very poorly executed and i did not care one bit for anything that was going on.i do want to elaborate on the absolute JOY that alex and ava are though ü•∞ apparently miss huang agrees bec they\'re her favorites.meet,Alex(H): he has a god complex you can\'t rival, a dick for days, a massive ego, works as a full-time stalker for six months, will get jealous of a fly if it dares to hover around ava for more than a second, thinks he\'s the most special mf on god\'s green earth, isn\'t scared of anything not even wild animals, has HSAM (Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory) that he uses to relive a traumatic event of his past bec he\'s weird like that, is a walmart version of Christian Grey, and he\'s so freaking smart that he quadrupled his investments and also became a millionaire in high school because of a technology he invented ü•∫üíÖüèª doesn\'t he sound like an absolute bombastic slay?let me tell you he\'s acc not. alex isa man written by a woman who has probably never had any interaction w a man beforehe\'s so cringey you won\'t believe it - but I\'ll let him speak for himself üòµ\u200düí´‚ï∞‚îÄ‚ñ∏ ‚ùùNothing turned me off more than desperation, which reeked stronger than their perfume.‚ùûsays the guy that left his job and followed ava around for six months like a pathetic loser üôèüèª‚ï∞‚îÄ‚ñ∏ ‚ùùBesides, everyone knew I was the power behind the throne, anyway.‚ùûpower, throne, kingdom - shut ur fucking mouth fr ü§°‚ï∞‚îÄ‚ñ∏ ‚ùùIt was the same thing that would‚Äôve gone through any red-blooded male‚Äôs mind.

I even liked Bridget and wasn‚Äôt bothered by the fact that she was aliteralprincess (which, granted, is utterly unbelievable but I still found that aspect to be amusing despite its utter incredulity).‚úèTropes:„Ä∞ The writing style was good and the book literally had all the tropes that I usually adore (brother‚Äôs best friend, grumpy/sunshine pairing...) and they were actually well done.„Ä∞ I really liked the fact that Ava‚Äôs brother did not forgive Alex at the end. Honestly, I thought that was very realistic considering Alex‚Äôs betrayal of their friendship and the way he manipulated both Josh and Ava. I also found that aspect quite refresh since it leaves their friendship open for further development later on in the series (in Josh and Jules‚Äô book).‚úèRepresentation:„Ä∞ We have a beautiful Asian heroine and a hero of Ukrainian descent, which we just love to see. I also really appreciated all the small details that the author included to help us learn more about the Chinese culture; that aspect was honestly well done and seamlessly integrated in the story.„Ä∞ The first half of the book was really entertaining and I was sure that this would become a very fun and quick read for me. The second half however is where things started to go south in my opinion and this is why...üîπWhat I did not like:‚úèPlot:„Ä∞ During the second half of the book I started getting the feeling that I was watching a bad soap opera. Things started becoming incredibly unbelievable and cheesy. For instance, the whole thing with Ava‚Äôs father was such a clich√© that I was honestly surprised that none of the author‚Äôs beta readers had told her to cut out this ‚Äúplot twist‚Äù. The writing in these instances also needed rework since they reinforced the feeling that I was watching a Disney villain giving his speech and congratulating himself on his wickedness. This is an example of what I mean:‚ÄúMichael‚Äôs face remained anguished for several more seconds before it twisted and morphed into a hideous mask. His eyes gleamed with delighted malice, and his mouth spread into a mocking smile. [...] ‚ÄòBravo‚Äô. He slow-clapped. ‚ÄòI almost had you,‚Äô he told me. ‚ÄòYou should‚Äôve seen yourself‚ÄôI swear, Mrs. James was real,‚Äôhe mimicked, laughing.‚Äù„Ä∞ And don‚Äôt even get me started on how Micheal was the man who supposedly killed his parents only to find out that Alex‚Äôs uncle was actually behind the whole thing. I would genuinely be shocked if anyonewasshocked by this ‚Äúturn of events‚Äù.‚úèAspects of the writing style and characterization:„Ä∞ And this is what I personally think was my biggest issue with this book. The novel does an awful lot of ‚Äòtelling‚Äô instead of ‚Äòshowing‚Äô. Both characters go from not knowing each other to being madly in love in a short amount of time. And the thing is? They‚Äôve supposedly been seeing each other and getting to know each other for months by that point. But we as readers are only told of this passage of time instead of shown the moments that they spent together. This is not something that can work in a romance novel. We need to see the main characters slowly opening up to each other and starting to like each other in order for us to believe in their romance. This is why some romances that are set within the span of a single week work. Because its not about how many months the main characters have known each other, it‚Äôs about how valuable and detailed each interaction between the two is.„Ä∞ This happened once again when it came to the groveling aspect. A literalyearpasses in which the hero is supposedly groveling and begging the heroine to take him back. However, readers are once again not shown any part of said groveling. This is what I mean:‚ÄúAlex and I had developed a new... well, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I could call it a friendship, but it was a step up from whatever we had when he arrived in London a year ago.‚Äù„Ä∞ Ummm, I‚Äôm sorry what? You can‚Äôt go from having the heroine say that she will never forgive the hero to having her say something like ‚ÄòAlex and I developed a friendship over the past year‚Äô. If you do that then you can‚Äôt expect your readers to believe in the legitimacy of said friendship because guess what (and I cannot stress this enough):üëèPassage of time alone does not a convincing relationship make.üëèWe need to see the development between the characters in order to root for them because frankly? By that point I neither believed in Ava and Alex‚Äôs love nor did I believe in Alex‚Äôs remorse because I hadn‚Äôt been able to see him truly grovel. That said, I honestly hope that this aspect of the novel gets better in the second installment.üîπFinal thoughts:„Ä∞ If you read any of my ‚Äòpre-reading‚Äô updates then you know that I had incredibly high expectations for this book. I had never read any of this author‚Äôs works before but this novel contained all of the tropes that I usually adore. The snippets that I saw on the author‚Äôs instagram page also reinforced my belief that this was definitely a book that I would enjoy. Hell, when I first added this on Goodreads it literally only had about 20 or 25 other people who had also added it (so I truly found it very early on). That said, while I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say that I was disappointed or let down by the execution in this book (because, as I previously mentioned, I enjoyed many aspects of it), I will still say that I think many things needed rework and further editing.„Ä∞ Finally, I do think that I might read the sequel since I truly enjoyed the friendship group in here and I do think that this author has a lot of potential. So do I recommend this book? I think this could be the perfect example of a guilty pleasure read in my opinion. Many things needed to be done differently but this wasn‚Äôt a horrible read in any way.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/rose_books2/‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-PRE-READING UPDATES:‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-Ok but I just stalked the author‚Äôs instagram and now I‚Äôm pretty freaking excited about thisüò©‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-Mmmm I think I‚Äôm intriguedFr tho, gotta love the grumpy/sunshine trope loll.'}]"

But Winter Solstice is finally approaching, and with it, the joy of a hard-earned reprieve.Yet even the festive atmosphere can't keep the shadows of the past from looming. As Feyre navigates her first Winter Solstice as High Lady, her concern for those dearest to her deepens. They have more wounds than she anticipated-scars that will have a far-reaching impact on the future of their court.Bridging the events ofA Court of Wings and Ruinwith the later books in the series,A Court of Frost and Starlightexplores the far-reaching effects of a devastating war and the fierce love between friends.","[{'rating': 3, 'content': '‚ÄùMother above and Cauldron save me.‚ÄùYep, that‚Äôs exactly what I thought when I read another one of Feyre and Rhy‚Äôs naughty scenes! The words might have been the same; my thoughts came with an eye roll instead of pleasure though. As did a lot of other things while I read this novella. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I still enjoyed almost every second of this and it was really nice to spend some time with all those characters again BUT (yes, it‚Äôs a big but) there were a lot of things that didn‚Äôt sit well with me and you can bet your lovely behind on the fact that I‚Äôm going to point them out later on when I get to the spoilery parts of this review.Generally speaking this wasn‚Äôt bad. We got to see a little bit of our characters normal lives and I think we can all agree that after everything they went through they deserve some normalcy and happiness. It was nice to walk through Velaris, to go Solstice shopping with Mor and Feyre and to see those beloved characters interact with each other. They all survived the war and each and every single one of them is trying to cope with the aftermath. There are plenty of wounds that still need to heal and I‚Äôm kind of grateful Sarah decided to give her characters some room to come to terms with everything. So yes, this novella might not have a huge plot but definitely provides a good transition into the next series. ;-)Still, there were quite a lot of interesting dialogues and a bunch of things that either made me happy or caused me to get angry. Mostly it was the relationships between the characters and so this is exactly what I‚Äôm going to write about. Buckle up! This is going to be a hard ride! *lol*From here on out, I‚Äôll talk about the relationships and ships of the characters, so this isn‚Äôt only going to be rant and gush feast but also a spoiler celebration! If you still continue to read and haven‚Äôt read ACOFAS yet, it‚Äôs at your own risk! Don‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt warn you! ;-)The relationships & ships:Feyre & Rhys:‚ÄùBut you are bothering ‚Äì you‚Äôre both still working to make this peace last. Peace, Rhys. We have peace, and the true kind. Enjoy it ‚Äì enjoy each other. You paid the debt before it was ever a debt.‚ÄùI totally agree with Cassian and even though this might sound harsh now I still need to say it: I want them to enjoy each other too, but please not as the MCs of the following books. I love Feyre and Rhys, I really do, but I think from ACOWAR on out their character development was kind of detrimental. I already mentioned it in my review of ACOWAR and I‚Äôll say it again Feyre‚Äôs and Rhys‚Äôs holier-than-thou attitude is beginning to get on my nerves. Feyre and her friends weren‚Äôt the only ones that suffered and it would be really nice if she‚Äôd get out of her pink bubble and would acknowledge the fact that others hurt too! It‚Äôs good that Rhys and her have each other but not everyone is as lucky as them and it would help to remember that they made mistakes too! Also if I read about ‚Äútoes that curl‚Äù in Feyre‚Äôs boots one more time I‚Äôm going to be sick. Yes, we got it, Rhys is such a sexy male and they really love each other. If you ask me their story should have ended after ACOWAR because right now I have more negative feelings towards them than positive ones and this is actually kinda sad. >_< Okay, Feysand shippers are allowed to take out their pitchforks and torches now... Just give me a little head start, will you? ;-PFeyre & Lucien:‚ÄùAnd what, exactly, does this Band of Exiles plan to do? Host events? Organize party-planning committees?‚ÄùLucien‚Äôs metal eye clicked faintly and narrowed. ‚ÄúYou can be as much of an asshole as that mate of yours, you know that?‚ÄùI think Feyre was a real bitch to Lucien in this book. And no, I‚Äôm not sorry for saying it out loud. After all someone has to do it and I don‚Äôt mind it being me. I mean if she really wants him to be friends with her, she has to accept that he has his own life and doesn‚Äôt want to depend on her and Rhys. If she‚Äôd be honest to herself she‚Äôd realize that Lucien isn‚Äôt welcome at her court and that he has his reasons to stay away from them. I think the only two people who feel real sympathy for Lucien are Az and Amren and they only do it to some extent. So yeah, she can‚Äôt expect him to be happy with the situation. Lucien lost so much over the centuries and now he even lost Tam and his second home. It‚Äôs not Feyre‚Äôs call to decide what‚Äôs best for him! Especially because she‚Äôs actually the reason why Lucien isn‚Äôt welcome at Tam‚Äôs place anymore. So nope, take care of your own court and leave Lucien be! Thank you very much! And a huge YAY for Lucien! Because he dared to call Feyre and Ryhs out on their bullsh*t and didn‚Äôt back down! That‚Äôs my man!!! <333 Also I totally agree with him! Rhys shouldn‚Äôt have said what he did and the way he treated Tam cost him a lot of my sympathy.‚ÄùYour mate should have known better than to kick a downed male.‚Äù‚ÄùI can‚Äôt stand to be in the same room as her for more than two minutes. I can‚Äôt stand to be in this court and have your mate pay for the very clothes on my back.‚ÄùElain & Lucien:‚ÄùHe hadn‚Äôt mentioned Elain, or his proximity to her. Elaine had not asked him to stay, or to go. And whether she cared about the bruises on his face, she certainly hadn‚Äôt let on.‚ÄùSo if you already put away your pitchforks and torches, guess now is the right time to draw them out again, because this isn‚Äôt going to be nice and tell you what: I actually don‚Äôt care! I‚Äôll say it as it is: I HATE Elain! There, I said it! And I‚Äôm not even sorry for it! You think Nesta is a witch? Oh well, guess Elain is even worse because she hides it behind her super sweet appearance and gentle actions. By now I‚Äôve reached a point where I despise her and I‚Äôm sick and tired of everyone defending this woman just because she is so sweet! Where was Elain when Feyre was taken by Tam? What did Elain do when Feyre went out hunting for them? Nesta might be a witch, and I can‚Äôt even believe I‚Äôm saying this, but at least she went looking for Feyre. What did Elain do? She got engaged to Grayson! YAY! Way to go! Also everyone loving precious and dear Elain! WTF?!!! Did Elain ever do anything except of looking lovely?! (Yes, she might be a great cook and good at gardening but seriously is that all!???!!!) AND WHY THE FREAKING HELL IS EVERYONE DEFENDING ELAIN WITH THE WORDS ‚ÄúElain is Elain‚Äù!??? ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?? WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN!!?? I‚Äôm sick and tired of her getting away with everything because she‚Äôs everybody‚Äôs darling! Lucien deserves so much better than that! She can‚Äôt even talk to him for a few minutes? She can‚Äôt even thank him for the present he got her? Where was her present for him?! And just for the record: LUCIEN DIDN‚ÄôT WANT HER TO BE HIS MATE!!! He‚Äôs as innocent when it comes to their mating bond as Elain! It‚Äôs not his fault that they are mates and people better remember this when they judge him for trying to get to know her! She doesn‚Äôt even give him a chance to get to know her so she‚Äôs just cruel and mean in my eyes. If she doesn‚Äôt change her attitude in the next trilogy I‚Äôll never ship her with anyone. Not even Az. No one! For all I care she can live with her precious flowers and become one of them! GRRRRRRR!!!! AKDFASDFJASLDFJKASDFLK! Okay, I‚Äôm fine now. XD‚ÄùElain, at least, would be too polite to send Lucien away when he wanted to help. She was too polite to send him away on a normal day. She just ignored him or barely spoke to him until he got the hint and left.‚ÄùThose doe-brown eyes turned toward me. Sharper than I‚Äôd ever seen them. ‚ÄúAnd that entitles him to my time, my affections?‚Äù‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I blinked. ‚ÄúBut he is a good male.‚Äù Despite our harsh words. Despite this Band of Exiles bullshit. ‚ÄúHe cares for you.‚Äù‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt know me.‚Äù‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt give him the chance to even try to do so.‚ÄùCassian & Nesta:‚ÄùA storm is going to hit in a few days. I‚Äôd like you to distribute this amongst those who might feel its impact the hardest.‚ÄùCassian is so, so damn precious and he‚Äôs stuck with Nesta! That‚Äôs not fair! I think when it comes to me disliking characters in this series it‚Äôs a tie between Nesta and Elain. I just hate them both. (I know I‚Äôm making a lot of friends with this review. *lol* But I just can‚Äôt help it!) I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever be able to ship them but after seeing that Nesta still didn‚Äôt change... Well, I just can‚Äôt ship them. By now I don‚Äôt even know if her character can be redeemed and if Sarah doesn‚Äôt work her magic with her I‚Äôll never board this ship. And it will take a HUGE amount of magic to make her character at least a little bit more likable! And to everyone out there who likes Nesta and thinks I‚Äôm mean: I know she has PTSD too and I know that she suffers at least as much as all the other characters around her do, but that‚Äôs no reason to lash out at the others. If she wants to be secluded from them, live in a cheap apartment, drink all day and sleep with every fae male that comes her way: Okay! But to hurt the others, to fight them even though they are trying to help her, to spend Feyre‚Äôs and Rhys money without asking them: That‚Äôs not okay!! How many people have to offer her help until she accepts it? How often will she hurt poor Cassian because she‚Äôs just too proud to acknowledge that she has a serious problem? Just like Lucien, Cassian deserves so much better than her and I think I‚Äôll make a petition for both of them! #FreeCassian&LucienFromTheClutchesOfTheCruelArcheronSisters‚ÄùNesta is Nesta. She does what she wants, even if it kills her sister. I‚Äôve offered her job after job, and she refuses them all.‚ÄùTamlin & Rhys:Forgiveness could be a gift to both, but what he‚Äôd done... ‚ÄúDo you want her to?‚ÄùHis green eyes were empty. ‚ÄúDo I deserve it?‚ÄùNo. Never.He must have read it on my face, because he asked, ‚ÄúDo you forgive me ‚Äì for your mother and sister?‚ÄùI‚Äôm not okay with the way Rhys treated Tamlin! Yes, he made mistakes, yes he hurt Feyre, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that they have to hurt him too! Rhys should have known better than that, he should have been better than that and he shouldn‚Äôt have kicked Tam when he was already on the ground. Everyone can see that Tamlin is hurting and to treat him like that? To say what Rhys said to him? WOAH!! That was just cruel, mean and uncalled-for. I‚Äôm feeling really sorry for Tam now and Rhys helping him with the elk doesn‚Äôt make this any better. He only helped him because he might need him in future, not because he actually cared. Where is your compassion for Tam, Rhys? Where is the Rhys of ACOMAF I fell in love with? I don‚Äôt see him anymore. *shakes head*‚ÄùI hope you live the rest of your miserable life alone here. It‚Äôs a far more satisfying end than slaughtering you.‚ÄùElain & Az:Cassian sat up, the portrait of outrage. ‚ÄúNo?‚ÄùAzriel tucked in his wings. ‚ÄúWould you want people betting on you?‚ÄùI think the only reason Az reacted like that is because he might feel guilty for liking Elain. It‚Äôs so obvious that Sarah wants them to end up together and all those little tense moments between them speak volumes about her intentions. But as I said: I can‚Äôt ship Elain with anyone right now. Az is too sweet and gentle to end up with her and I really don‚Äôt want them to be together. Not because I would begrudge him a relationship with her, but because I think that he deserves better than her. After Mor played with him for centuries Az deserves the world, and then some! If Elain doesn‚Äôt change and acknowledges her misbehaviour against Lucien then I can‚Äôt ship this ship. And quite honestly, if I‚Äôd be Az I wouldn‚Äôt want to be with someone who treats their mate like that.‚ÄùAzriel emerged from the sitting room, a glass of wine in hand and wings tucked back to reveal his fine, yet simple black jacket and pants.I felt, more than saw, my sister go still as he approached. Her throat bobbed.‚ÄùRhys & Lucien:‚ÄùI can let go of the taunts,‚Äù he said, scanning my face. ‚ÄúAnd the fact that he still harbors some hope of one day reuniting with Tamlin. But I cannot let go of how he treated you after Under the Mountain.‚ÄùI‚Äôm just glad that Lucien became friends with Vassa and Jurian because as I already mentioned above, he obviously isn‚Äôt welcome at the Night Court. Rhys still doesn‚Äôt like him and Lucien deserves more than to be tolerated. He deserves to be respected, to be loved and cherished and not to be treated like sh*t! Also what the hell does Rhys even mean with how he treated Feyre after Under the Mountain? Lucien did nothing wrong, he was there for her, tried to help her, defended her against Tam, spoke up for her and confronted Tamlin. And what did he get in return? Tamlin reprimanded him and might have even physically hurt him, Ianthe abused him and Tam let it happen because he refused to take part in the ritual, and Feyre?! Do I really have to point out what Feyre did? She lied to him, claimed that Rhys had turned her and even after she came back to the spring court she continued to lie to him and hurt him even more by destroying the only place he called home. Hell, she even used him to antagonize Tam and to destroy his friendship with Lucien. A great friend she was to him! And this after everything he did for her Under the Mountain. Hell, he even got whipped because he helped her and almost died as well. To destroy your friends‚Äô life is a great way to show him gratitude. Well done, Feyre! So WHO EXACTLY TREATED WHOM LIKE SH*T AFTER UNDER THE MOUNTAIN, RHYS???!!!! Mhmm??? Care to enlighten me? And one more thing before I come to the end of thisrantreview: Lucien was in no position to help Feyre because he suffered from PTSD too. That‚Äôs something everyone always seems to forget. You can‚Äôt help someone else if you‚Äôre drowning yourself. And people better keep that in mind before they talk badly about him.Conclusion:I really thought I‚Äôd enjoy this novella and then move on to the next trilogy but for some reason those 229 pages kinda irked me. Big time. *lol* I guess that‚Äôs mostly due to the fact that all the things I already criticized in ACOWAR seemed to be even more prominent in this short story and I just couldn‚Äôt ignore it any longer. Also all the chapters we got from Mor‚Äôs POV didn‚Äôt contribute anything to the story, which is the main reason I didn‚Äôt even mention her in my review. All told this was a nice addition to the first trilogy and a good segue into the next one and I really hope that Sarah J. Maas will tackle all those issues I just pointed out. After all, ‚ÄúHope dies last‚Äù! ;-PThis fanart was made by:https://twitter.com/Niruskyart'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '‚ú®Hardcore SJM fans need not engage, kindly move along without reading this review.‚ú®Me after finishing the book:IM FREEEEEE!!!!!!!!

Fucking finally.*except SJM has a talent for ruining main characters so what happens when secondary characters become the main ones? Uhhh we shall find out I guess.Speaking more generally,this book was just mostly bad.I‚Äôm not only talking aboutthe writing, whichneeded a lot of editing, but the general feeling surrounding it all. Starting from the blurb, which is just a few sentences from the first chapter copypasted together. People, the blurb doesn‚Äôt even make sense. That extra sentence about snow? It shouldn‚Äôt be there. They obviously needed one more sentence to make the blurb longer and didn‚Äôt know what else to pick. It‚Äôs just bad. Whoever did that did a very poor job.* And that makes me angry.*EDIT: oh boy they changed the blurb!!! More than a full week after the book released! But I got receipts. #NeverForgetTheBlurbAuthors, even big ones, still have to fight hard to see their books picked up by publishers, be sold, and then be read and hyped by readers. But apparently that rule doesn‚Äôt apply to SJM.The publisher doesn‚Äôt even put any effort in pre-release things like writing a decent blurb, because they know her books are going to sell anyway. And I mean, I‚Äôm here writing this review because I‚Äôve read this book despite swearing that I was done with this series after ACOWAR, because she has a talent for making you want to know what happens to the characters, even if (especially if) they‚Äôre not the main ones.But the least the author and the publisher could do is put some fucking effort and deliver a product that‚Äôs better than this. Instead, it feels likeeither SJM is a rare case of writer who gets worse every book she writes, or the publisher has decided that she‚Äôs still going to sell regardless how many rounds of editing her books get,so they might as well never edit them, thus never delivering a polished book.Because, folks, we might have started making fun of the wordm*tefor shits and giggles, but it‚Äôs become a big fucking problem, especially in this book. You know the writing advice that says to just use someone‚Äôs name when talking about them, instead of saying, idk, ‚Äúthe French girl,‚Äù or ‚Äúthe red-haired boy‚Äù? SJM has never heard of it. Think about your own internal monologue. Do you think of your spouse as ‚Äúmy spouse‚Äù all the time? Or do you simply think about them with their name?Cassian and my mate‚Äôs sister did not speak to each other at all.This sentence just does not flow. And it‚Äôs just one of about 70 times the word m*te was used (and keep in mind this is a 200 pages book).I wonder how many creative writing students failed their assignments for doing exactly what the most hyped YA fantasy author these days does constantly.Do we also want to have The Talk about theweird connotations and implicationsthat this word has? Oh boy, this conversation is about three years late, but I absolutely Do Not like all this animalistic shit, starting with m*te, moving on to how many times people purr, referring to people as males and females (ah, the good ol‚Äô binary) (YES I FUCKING KNOW SHE CAN‚ÄôT CALL THEM MEN AND WOMEN BUT JFC JUST STOP), to the weird possessiveness that the whole m*ting system entails. Also!!! Toxic masculinity!!!!!!! Weird unchallenged sexist comments!!!!! Trying to make Rhys sound soooo feminist when apparently his job is being horny 24/7!!!!!! Have Rhys (a literal sexual abuse victim) talk about how hecan‚Äôt standto be next to his m*te without, and I quote, BEING BURIED INSIDE HER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ohhhh now you\'ve done it, you got me mad. If you read a SJM book it seems like thinking/talking/having sex for most part of your day is the normalcy. Which it can be!!!! But guess what! Ace people exist!!!! People with low sexual drive exist!!!!!!!!!! That‚Äôs normal too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh no I‚Äôm using too many exclamation points let me hire an editor. When every single character you portray acts the same exact way towards something like sex, you‚Äôre telling your readers (mostly teens) that that‚Äôs what‚Äôs expected of them, that that‚Äôs how everyone is like. It‚Äôs no secret that diversity doesn‚Äôt exist in SJM‚Äôs world, and that involves how people view sex and romantic relationships too.It‚Äôs amazing that YA books have sex positivity.But books need to also acknowledge that ace people exist too. Protagonists and love interests that aren‚Äôt some sort of sex gods need to be there too. Thin boys, fat boys, trans boys need to be there too.If after >10 books a writer can‚Äôt get out of her own self-insert fantasies about what type of men she likes, maybe she isn‚Äôt a great writer after all.Maybe she needs to listen to the (still too small) part of her readers that demand More, that demand Better.I went on a HUGE tangent and I don\'t even fucking care. There were parts of the book that I liked. I even enjoyed most of its central part. I enjoyed Nesta‚Äôs PTSD portrayal and she‚Äôs the only reason I‚Äôm going to read the next book because parts of her trauma and her way of dealing with it have the potential to mean so fucking much to me. But I‚Äôm going to lower my rating to 1 star because I‚Äôm tired of all the things I mentioned above,I\'m tired of being treated like shit by an author and her team because they expect me to worship her when she doesn\'t even try anymore.My 1 star isn\'t even gonna change anything because everyone‚Äôs giving this the usual five stars, but I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm here and as a readerI demand better, I demand the bare fucking minimum, and I don‚Äôt think this book even tried.This was a buddy read withmy bon m@te(I‚Äôm sorry)____Correct me if I\'m wrong but shouldn\'t blurbs, like, tell you something about the book..........why is this one just a recap of the previous ones lmaoAlso shout-out to sjm for managing to squeeze the word ""mate"" within like 100 words of bad blurb'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '#1A Court of Thorns and Roses‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ#2A Court of Mist and Fury‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ#3A Court of Wings and Ruin‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ#3.5A Court of Frost and Starlight‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖFirst of all, let me just express my total devastation that an entire year of counting down the days until this book‚Äôs release isgonein two and a half hours of reading. I mean, I knew it was only going to be a novella, but‚Ä¶ *sobs quietly*I didn‚Äôt expect it to go by THAT fast!This amazing little series has pulled me through some really dark times and brought so much joy into my life that I know I will treasure it, always. ‚ô•Even now, with that bond again flowing between us like a river of star-flecked night, the echo of its vanishing lingered.ACOFAS definitely doesn‚Äôt read anything like the 3 main novels; the chapters switch perspectives occasionally, featuring POVs from Feyre, Rhysand, Cassian, and Morrigan. What struck me as particularly odd about this was the fact that Feyre and Rhysand‚Äôs chapters were in first-person, while Cassian and Morrigan‚Äôs were in third‚Äîa slightly jarring writing style, but nothing too detrimental.In his stare, I could have sworn galaxies swirled. In the shadows between his wings, the glorious depths of the night dwelled.We do get some really sweet and domestic Feysand moments, but I was actually surprised at how little time they actually spend together during the novella (and how little sex there is‚Äîwho is this author and what did she do with Sarah?!). We did finally get the infamous wall scene! There are some incredibly sweet moments, at least a few scenes of Rhysand being his lovable cinnamon roll self, and a completely expected but adorable turn of events for their little family.Shadows different from anything my powers summoned, spoke to. Born in a lightless, airless prison meant to break him. Instead, he had learned its language.Feysand obsession aside, I loved how much time we got to spend with Cass and Az, learning more about their respective histories and how they‚Äôve healed from the war. With Cassian‚Äôs perspectives especially, it felt like this was written to be a legitimate ‚Äúbridge‚Äù between the ACOTAR series and whatever comes next, which I was honestly fond of, even if the next book‚Äôs focus on Cassian and Nesta does have me pretty nervous.Lucien had not come here to make amends during Solstice, I realized as Tamlin opened the door to the dark library. Lucien had come here out of pity. Mercy.Perhaps the most unexpected bits were the ones in which we visited Tamlin‚Äîwith a novella this short, I honestly didn‚Äôt expect to see him at all, and certainly not in the state in which Rhysand found him. I never thought I would feel sorry for him, and I still think he‚Äôs a walking, talking garbage can, but I still couldn‚Äôt help being at least a little bit sad to see how far he‚Äôs fallen. I truly do hope that Sarah will write more about him in the future, because I can‚Äôt help but always feel that, no matter what a jerk he is, there‚Äôs something interesting about his potential as a character.Cassian set me down at last. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd you get me for Solstice?‚Äù I smacked his arm. ‚ÄúA heaping pile of shut the hell up.‚ÄùWas ACOFAS everything I hoped and dreamed it would be? Honestly, no. This is more of a 4.5 rating, but you can believe that I did not hesitate to round up to 5 stars, because at the end of the day, I got to spend a few hundred pages with my precious bat babies, and watch this adorable little family interact and taunt and fuss and cry and laugh with one another, and that was all I reallyneededthis novella to offer me.

Okay. I willtryto be objective about this one but I just finished ACOWAR and I am still riding that emotional high.To summarize:for a companion novel - not bad at all. It's full ofcotton-candy fluff,and I devoured every single bite.Now, this one was a bitheavy on the smutand a bit light on the Nessian but it definitely hadall the right feelsin all the right places.Stars flickered around us, sweet darkness sweeping in. As if we were the only souls in a galaxy.For those who don't know (and are curious) this novel sprang from avery drunk conversationbetween Sarah J. Maas (aka the Maaster) and her publisher.Maas confessed that in her free time that she wrote fanfiction of her work. Just little drabbles of what happened in between ACOWAR and her next novel. The publisher thought,we could sell that...And thus, this novel was born.So, keeping the origins in mind,I really liked this novel.There wasn't a big-bad or end-of-the-world subplot, not much plot development happened BUT this was afun and lightheartedread.And honestly, after ACOWAR, these charactersdeservea fewmonthsyears off from the doom-and-gloom.‚ÄúDangerous words, Rhysand,‚Äù Amren warned, strutting through the door, nearly swallowed up by the enormous white fur coat she wore. Only her chin-length dark hair and solid silver eyes were visible above the collar. She looked‚Äî‚ÄúYou look like an angry snowball,‚Äù Cassian said.Feyre and friends are spending theirfirst winter solstice(aka Christmas without Christ) together. And despite the warmth of the hearth, not all of the winter chill is kept out.Feyre frets aboutreuniting her family.Rhysand freaksout about what to buy her (Solstice and birthday presents!!).Mor isabsolutely terribleat expressing her feelings (and gift-giving in general).And Amren makes outlike a bandit(mostly cause everyone knows what to buy her - priceless jewels).And, of course,Nesta being Nestamade this novel shine.Every time she and Cassian are in the same room the dynamic between them is just perfect.He'd seen Nesta in that particular pose, too. He called it her I Will Slay My Enemies pose.Cassian had named about two dozen poses for Nesta at this point. Ranging from I Will Eat Your Eyes for Breakfast to I Don't Want Cassian to Know I'm Reading Smut. The latter was his particular favorite.I know this is just a companion novel and that there won't be much development in terms of relationships but c'mon Sarah J. Maas.Throw us a bone.(Actually, if you read the sneak peek at book 4 included at the end, I suppose she does offer us a bit of relationship hints).I am soemotionally investedin this series right now. I wish I could just time-machine myself into next year for book 4. But until I get that working, this companion novel will certainly tide me over.P.s. I got to read the hand-stamped version of Sarah J. Maas's book. All I could think of the whole time was -ohmygosh.

But if you read this just as an epilogue to the ACOTAR trilogy, it\'s just pointless and cringy fan service. If I have to read the words ""illyrian babies"" one more time it will actually induce vomiting.-----Original review, May 2018:we were all played like a violin in investing in this book. It‚Äôs $18 for lazy, messy fanfiction. This is 200+ pages of complete emptiness. There‚Äôs no purpose to any of this other than a money grab and longwinded, unnecessary epilogue to the original trilogy.This literally reads like someone from Tumblr wanted a scene with all the ACOTAR characters having christmas together so sarah whipped out her laptop. There was no substance or set-up to a new series at all. 90% of this book‚Äîand I wish I was kidding‚Äîis just the characters all going shopping for each other\'s presents--multiple times. The other 10% is Feyre and Rhys speaking in each other‚Äôs heads through the bond about how much they want to fuck each other. Additional scenes include the characters getting drunk every 30 pages, weird side POVs from characters who add nothing to the story, and a snowball fight between warriors. I honest to God am not joking when I say if I read this on fanfiction.net, I would laugh at it and say it‚Äôs unrealistic and poorly done. It‚Äôs just pure stupidity and vapid smut for the fans‚Äô wish fulfillment.The writing in this is so messy. ‚ÄúGentlemales‚Äù brought me to a depth of hell I haven‚Äôt seen before, so thanks for that, Sarah. Every time a female character says something ‚Äúsoftly, but not weakly,‚Äù I feel like plunging a knife into my chest. Take a shot every time Sarah‚Äôs written that into one of her books. The sex scenes have so much potential to be steamy or whatever but Sarah ruins it by having the characters CONSTANTLY horny for each other, so it dampens any tension or angst. And the amount of times that sex is referenced in Rhys‚Äôs POV is utterly repulsive. At one point he justlooksat a table and is like ‚Äúmmm I‚Äôd fuck Feyre on that‚Äù ... [john mulaney voice] FUCKING WHAT?? Even in Feyre‚Äôs POV when I could get away from his gross thoughts, he‚Äôd always talk shit to her down the bond and try and get in her pants or say something ‚Äúsexy‚Äù but it‚Äôs just so corny and stupid and gross and it ruins the scene and I wanted to throw my book it was so irritating.I just think it‚Äôs funny how Feyre is the high lady and in Velaris, apparently women‚Äîoh, i‚Äôm sorry, FEMALES‚Äîare toootally equal to men *ahhem* males, and yet this entire book, Rhys is traveling to different courts and talking treaties and strategies with people and going off on business and Feyre does what? Cleans their home, goes shopping (no less than 4 times), cooks meals, and maybe if she‚Äôs feeling frisky, paints a little or has sex with her husband‚Äîoh, i‚Äôm sorry *ahhem*mate‚Ä¶. Sarah, don‚Äôt pretend that women are so equal to men but then literally only have female characters who love jewels and shopping and cooking and serving men and having sex. Even Amren didn‚Äôt slit a throat in this‚Äîshe just complained about pooping and then had sex with Varian. Nesta and Lucien are the only vaguely interesting characters in this and I don‚Äôt like either of them. Their anger and distance made them more interesting than the characters in this getting shit-faced, making lame sexual jokes to each other, and referencing characters from the original trilogy I don‚Äôt care about.I wanted there to be something good about this because I genuinely loved ACOMAF and I‚Äôm waiting to feel a glimpse of the mastery that went into that book, but these new books just fan wish fulfillment at this point. This book was COMPLETELY unnecessary and the fact that Sarah is only extending the world to exploit the characters people like and get more money is just low. Let this series die, the world is done. The characters have exhausted their arcs and their humor is dumb and dry.Gave this book a star because Azriel deserves better than this bullshit.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Ok, it\'s time for an unpopular opinion. I\'m sure I\'ll get nasty-grammed all the way until next year for this but.....I didn\'t enjoy this. Not in the slightest.Granted, this is all opinion based; there\'s nothing inherently wrong with this book, I just found myself bored from beginning to end. In fact, I felt like the chapter excerpt for book #4 in the back had more to offer than this entire ""novella"" provided in 220+ pages. If you loved this one, I truly am happy for you, but I felt the need to provide some honest feedback in case there are others who may have the same expectations that I did here. I\'m going to keep this as spoiler free as possible, but if you haven\'t read the previous books in the series I would stop here.********************I\'m actually having trouble writing anything about the plot because nothing really happens in the story, aside from one decision that is made between Feyre and Rhysand. I did appreciate that the author was trying to offer a brief entrance back into the world she had created, and if this had been the beginning to a larger, 700+ page novel then I would have looked at this in a completely different light. I hate that I was expecting something to happen because it detracted from my ability to just enjoy being with these characters again as they shop for presents for each other and describe the food they are eating and recap everything we just read in the previous novel. But truly, if all you are looking for is atmosphere then you will likely enjoy this much more than I did. The descriptions of Velaris and the Illyrian war camps are breathtaking and exquisite.I did wholly appreciate the bit of backstory we get into Cassian initially, and my heart bled for Mor as she kept having to deal with her father and Eris and the Court of Nightmares, but every time I thought we were finally getting somewhere it would switch back over to shopping and food discussions. So I have to give credit to the fact that I was engaged in those moments, regardless of how the flow affected my absorption of the story. I was so disappointed in this disjointed lack of connection that I couldn\'t believe I was reading about the same inner circle I had once held so dear.Have I possible ""outgrown"" this series? I would hope not, because it\'s one of my favorite escapes, so I\'ve come to the conclusion that a big factor is this:I\'m tired of Feyre and Rhysand.It\'s not like I never want to hear about them, but I am so done with their narrative. It has come to the point where it feels repetitive and stale and dull and every single other character in this book, aside from a little bit of Cassian/Mor/Nesta was mostly left out. I wanted to hear more from all these other characters, from other courts spread across the continent, fromANYTHING BUT FEYRE AND RHYS.You know what I think the strongest point this novella has going for it?SJM actually made me feel a bit of conflicted sorrow for Tam Tam.I will never excuse abuse or the things he did wrong previously, but she managed to touch a tiny place inside my heart that wished for more for ole Tammy, that he could find someone to accept his brokenness and help heal him into a functioning member of fae society.I\'m sorry as I\'m completely aware that this review is just a bundle of disjointed thoughts (how\'s that for irony?), but it\'s the best I could do under the circumstances. Guys, I\'ll still read the next book, as I\'m interested in the Nesta/Cassian deal, but I sincerely hope that we see more Elain/Lucien/Azriel, because I missed my precious babies. I really did.Ok, NOW you can throw your pitchforks and knives at me, I\'m done!;)'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Rereading this again filled me up with all kinds of warmth and goodness.

Her books have brought about this sense of utter calm and happiness within me every time I read and think about them.This novella was everything we needed to potentially see the direction the other books will go in. And boy, am I beyond excited for it!I'm sure we'll be getting more of Cassian and Nesta in the next book and Sarah J Maas does character development ridiculously well and my god, being able to look forward and dream about their character exploration makes me too excited for words.I loved that we got see more of the Inner Circle. They are, hands down, my favourite bunch of fictional characters. I feel like I'm part of the family. I'm so glad some lighthearted, happy and sweet, tender moments were included in this. The family aspect between them all felt too real, and so good to read. And so worthy of them to have after the events of ACOWAR.And the emphasis on art in this book and seeing Feyre getting back into it as a form of healing for herself and others was a dream. Her dreams were finally actualised.The progression from ACOWAR to this felt natural and the cities and its people (including our main lot) were still healing, still too traumatised from the war. But progress was being made and I can't wait to see how that will be looked at in the upcoming spin-off series.I think at this point people are more interested in the progression of other characters. I'm here for it, but I don't ever see myself tiring of Feyre and Rhys and the bond between them! Chapter 22 is all I'm going to say.

So many books trivialize the worst aspect of PTSD and sexual assault and try to ""sovle it"" either with revenge or the magic romantic relationship that will make everything go away. Or the experiences just get ignored and brush aside! This happens to Mor, a secondary character in the 3rd book who is a rape survivor whenshe\'s forced to work along with her attacker and the one who puts her through that was the hero of the story!To be fair, I can understand the circumstances, doesn\'t mean I have to like that kind of story line, especially when that\'s something that good editing could have taken care of. That kind of disrespect for rape was unneccessary IMO. It didn\'t move the plot forward and it\'s out of character for Rhys to act like that. I love Rhys and didn\'t like the way SJM made him act.‚ô£ IF YOU BELIEVE ANY BOOK YOU PAY FOR SHOULD BE PROFESSIONALLY EDITEDI\'m not a grammar nazi and my spelling is terrible, but I can tell you, even some fanfiction I\'ve read has a more polished editing than this book. There\'s the overuse of words like mate. There are also problems with pace, repetitiveness, flow and consistency of the voices when changing from a narrator to the other and from a first person POV to a 3rd person POV. The characters sound too modern. The worldbuilding is not high fantasy at all. The setting of this series is pretty much like a modern series. All these are things that a content editor and a proofreader could have taken care off, but the publishers rushed publication lowering the quality of the editing and the writing.

This book is EROTICA (according to the goodreads description of the genre) marketed as YA.‚ô£A COURT OF WINGS AND RUIN ACOWAR2.5/5 because poor editing, f bombs, repetitiveness, unnecessary sex scenes and dangerous messages. No, glorifying revenge and abusive women isn\'t female empowerment. No, in most marriage it isn\'t always the woman\'s choice, it\'s always the choice of both of them.

It could be unintentionally. It could be intentionally. The reason doesn\'t matter. They\'re contributing to the false advertising.A fewbooktubers are being published or aspire to be published by the same IMPRINT of this new adult series. Others booktubers and bookbloggers seem to want good relationships with the publishing industry. They won\'t say anything that can hurt the marketing agenda of the big publishing houses.Note: Bookables, Benji Alderson and Polandbananas have mentioned this series is new adult , so of course a lot of booktubers are somehow honest, it\'s not cool calling out an entire community of readers because the dishonesty of a few bad apples. Distrust only the reviewers who call this series young adult.On the other hand, The Goodreads choice awards editors ignored the shelving system when they selected the categories for the goodreads choice awards last year. In the goodreads feedback group they told me that\'s how editors select categories: based on shelving.At the time of the awards this series was shelved primarily asfantasy and romanceby GR users, but still the editors made it compete on the young adult category. Not in romance (second most-shelved genre), not in fantasy (first most-shelved genre). They made it compete in young adult (third most-shelved genre followed closely by New adult)This review isn\'t meant to discouraging people from reading/buying the book. On the contrary. I\'m inviting you to read this series if you don\'t have problems with sexual content and abusive relationships.Despite all the problems I have with the false advertising I enjoyed the trilogy. But again I\'m warning you:‚ô£ NEVER trust the information that you see on Goodreads, Common sense media. and booktube. Not all reviewers are independent and unbiased. Do your research.Life is too short and TBR piles are too big to just ignore the kind of information that can help us decide what we will read next. Goodreads shouldn\'t try to hide that information.People who pay $15-18 for a hardcover and $8-15 for an ebook of a young adult ""high fantas"" book have every right to expect:‚ô£ 12-18 YO Main characters,‚ô£ no F bombs‚ô£ no explicit sex.‚ô£ A profesionally edited book.That\'s not what any book of this series delivers.Update 02-24People aren\'t expecting something like this:For a series that is supposedly about women\'s choices,when Goodreads, Booktubers and Publishers hide this information from young girls they are taking away their right to decide when or if they would read erotic content. Not to mention they\'re contributing to the book being sold in the Children\'s section of multiple retailers.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""the snowball fight?? The solstice gifts??

This is the equivalent of a fluffy fanfic with no plot. Honestly, the plot of this series wasn\'t great in the first place, so ACOFAS is basically what happens when SJM makes the good decision to scrap the plot and just focus on the part I actually care about - the characters.This novella is infamous for, uh...My reviews are rated G, thank you very much.Let\'s just say... stuff happened in the sky.I had nearly sent us crashing into the rooftops like an Illyrian whelp.If you listen carefully, you can hear my wheezing.But that\'s not the main problem I had with this, even though it was, well - a littlestrange.I hate the treatment of Tamlin.I hate it so much.In case you somehow have no idea what Tamlin did in ACOMAF, here\'s a summary.He locked Feyre in the house and emotionally abused her. It was bad.But Rhys was such a jerk about it when it wasFeyre\'sresponsibility to talk to him.Rhys just assumed that what he said was what Feyre wanted. He was needlessly cruel to someone who was suffering from PTSD.Tamlin\'s mental illness doesn\'t give him an excuse, obviously, but I\'m still angry that Tamlin didn\'t get the help he needed. He was traumatized, scarred; but everyone focused on Feyre, leaving him to become the person he is now - broken, depressed, scared. Believing he is only worthy of hate.Look at how jerky Rhys the Beast is being literally after Tamlin saved his life:No, Tamlin deserved what he\'d brought upon himself, this husk of a life. He deserved every empty room, every snarl of thorns, every meal he had to hunt for himself.That makes me sad. That actually makes me physically upset. No one deserves that. No one. And it\'s not even Rhys\'s place to say this stuff to Tamlin:""You deserve everything that has befallen you. You deserve this pathetic, empty house, your ravaged lands. I don\'t care if you offered that kernel of life to save me, I don\'t care if you still love my mate. I don\'t care that you saved her from Hybern, or a thousand enemies before that.I hope you live the rest of your miserable life alone here.""WHOA.CALM DOWN.Look at how depressed poor Tammy is:Tamlin didn\'t have shields around the house. None to prevent anyone from winnowing in, to guard against enemies appearing in his bedroom and slitting his throat.It was almost as if he was waiting for someone to do it.Let\'s be clear - I don\'t like Tamlin. He\'s a manipulative jerk. But he needs help. He clearly needs someone to take care of him like Rhys did for Feyre in ACOMAF. And he was not given that, so everyone hates him because of it.This also ruined Lucien\'s life. Now he\'s not welcome anywhere. And he says it like it is:""You can be as much of an asshole as that mate of yours, you know that?""I mean, he\'s not wrong.My other big complaint with this novella is the random ""feminist"" stuff that\'s thrown in so awkwardly? We get it, males can cook and clean. It\'s not that revolutionary. It should have been incorporated better into the story, rather than stated outright....cooking, cleaning, child-rearing, clothes-making... There was honor in such tasks - pride and good work to be found in them. But not when every single one of the females here was expected to do it... Traditions going back thousands of years, left mostly unchallenged.Until us. Until now.Rhysand is such a Feminist King‚Ñ¢I appreciate what this is trying to do, but it\'s so cheesy that... I really can\'t, I\'m sorry.""The boys can help decorate, clean, and cook. They\'ve got two hands.""Wow, Cassian\'s a Feminist King‚Ñ¢ too.Added to the random tragic backstories that strangers confessed to Feyre at the oddest times, this novella felt rather weak.Oh, yes, they wererandomall right.""My husband didn\'t return from the war.""Miss Girl, Feyre does not know you.Oh, and here was an absolutely stunning analogy that just... shook me to the core.This same random weaver person had a tapestry and she explained that the black thread was called the Void and that the white thread was called Hope. And then...""If I were to stop, if I were to let this loom or the spindle go silent... Then there would be no Hope shining in the Void.""Wow, so the Hope thread symbolizes hope and the Void thread symbolizes emptiness!!!Speaking of on-the-nose, Feyre has a weird relationship with money. As she reminds us, over and over and over again:The sums we allocated were sizable, more money than I\'d ever dreamed of possessing.This would be okay if it were only said once. But no.It didn\'t feel real, those numbers and figures. Like it was children\'s play money. I only bought what I needed.She says this so. many. times. Basically every time she buys something.Decadent - it felt decadent, and selfish, to shop.I didn\'t like how the side characters developed (besides Nesta, her trauma was just haunting). No one forgives Nesta for making Feyre hunt before Prythian, and yet everyone forgives Elain when she did the same thing. It doesn\'t make sense. There\'s no explanation.""You still can barely talk to Nesta,"" I said. ""Yet Elain you can talk to nicely.""""Elain is Elain.""""If you blame one, you have to blame the other.""""No, I don\'t. Elain is Elain.""What kind of explanation is that? ""Elain is Elain."" And? Are we supposed to forgiveherinstead of Nesta because she\'s so gentle and kind and sweet and blah blah blah? I don\'t think so.My theory is that Elain is not actually nice. She only speaks maybe 2-5 times during this novella, and most of the time, she\'s speaking coldly. Everyone is surprised, but... This is just how she is. She takes advantage of her family and friends thinking she\'s weak and needs protecting. But she\'s actually just a colder person than Nesta.Elain\'s voice was colder than usual.I\'d never heard Elain\'s voice so cold.Also, what is Feyre painting? No one knows. This entire novella is about her painting and I literally still don\'t know what she\'s painting.""What sort of things do you paint?""""The things that need telling.""How very descriptive.I painted and painted and painted.I painted until my back cramped... I\'d known what needed to come out of me the moment I perched on the rickety stool...But it began to emerge. Began to take form.I lowered my brush and stared at what I\'d created.Me.Or how I\'d been in the Ouroboros, that beast of scale and claw and darkness; rage and joy and cold. All of me. What lurked beneath my skin.But...But what is it??I painted through the grief that lingered at the weaver\'s story, painted for her loss. I painted all that rose within me, letting the past bleed onto the canvas, a blessed relief with each stroke of my brush.I still don\'t know.I hadn\'t any idea what to get them, other than this. The [paintings] I\'d worked on recently - glimpses of their stories. None of them explained what the paintings meant, what they beheld.Imagine knowing what Feyre is painting.For on that painting I\'d shown him what I had not revealed to anyone. The creature inside myself, the creature full of hate and regret and love and sacrifice, the creature that could be cruel and brave, sorrowful and joyous.I\'ll leave you with that mystery to figure out. If anyone knows what Feyre\'s painting, tell me and I will thank you profusely.1.5 stars; the word ""mate"" was used 71 times. this is not Australia, thank you'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3/5 Stars ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è‚ÄúStars flickered around us, sweet darkness sweeping in.

I\'m fucking dead because this book had no point in even existing. This book isn\'t even filler. It\'s nothing. I can\'t even describe it. This book was SUPPOSED to be the bridge between the old series and the new series. But like??? This book was just messy archiveofourown.org fanfiction. And not a good one. Not one I would give kudos to or write a comment under. One I wouldn\'t read at all. But now let\'s go to the summary of the book, which is also inadequate.Feyre, Rhys, and their close-knit circle of friends are still busy rebuilding the Night Court and the vastly-changed world beyond. But Winter Solstice is finally near, and with it, a hard-earned reprieve.Yet even the festive atmosphere can\'t keep the shadows of the past from looming. As Feyre navigates her first Winter Solstice as High Lady, she finds that those dearest to her have more wounds than she anticipated--scars that will have far-reaching impact on the future of their Court.See? Even the summary has nothing to prepare us for. As you all know, because I\'ve been raving and raving about those books for a million years, this is the series which has reintroduced me to fantasy. This series holds a very special place in my heart and I have come to loveSarah J. Maasas an author, too. This book was unlike anything she has written. This book was clearly a money grab, fanservice sort of fanfiction book. Which added almost nothing to this series. Everything that happened in this book could be included in a 30 page snippet at the beginning of the fourth book of the series, and it would all be ok. But let\'s talk specifics.The plotLet\'s talk about the non-existentPLOT. This book was: shopping with Feyre, shopping with Mor, cooking with Elain, hardcore negotiations with Rhys, Az and Cassian, some good ol\' fucking with good ol\' Feyre and Rhys, and then again shopping, and then again some fucking, and some tension featuring Nesta,ARTwith Feyre, brooding with Tamlin, sexual tension with Cassian and Nesta, and let\'s not forget the epic new single....MATES, included in the new album byFeyre ArcheronandRhysand(who still doesn\'t have a surname)M.A.T.E.S.(masturbation anal testicles ejaculation sex) (wtf was that). Let\'s be real here. Every time I read this fucking word I want to off myself. This word is ruined for me. I can never hear a dudebro call another dudebro ""mate"" and not remember this. Let this word rest. Let this word die. Let this word becomeFrost and Starlight(see what I did there). JUST LET THIS WORD GO. WE KNOW THEY\'RE MATES THEY\'RE MATED FOR LIFE THEY\'LL BE TOGETHER FOREVER AND FOREVER NAH NAH NAH. Ugh. If I had one euro (yes I\'m changing it from ""if I had a dollar"" if I had a fucking dollar I couldn\'t use it for anything) for every time the word ""mate"" is in this book, I would go to vacation to Santorini. It\'s expensive guys. You have no fucking clue how much.The POVsThis book added multiple perspectives of characters, which I found pretty interesting, but also unnecessary because nothing happens in this book and we don\'t need to see that nothing explained from multiple people, but you know, it happens. It confused me, though. We mostly see Feyre\'s and Rhys\'s POVs, in first person, and then we see some more characters\' POVs like Cassian and Mor but... in third person. Which is really unsettling and baffling. And those chapters are such heartwreching and heartbreaking moments from their past, and in this book, it feels our of place. A book about the Winter Solstice which is basically Christmas, shopping, gifts exchanging, happy times, scenes like these seem unnecessary. I couldn\'t take them seriously, and I wanted to. Also, it seems like we\'re gonna get the next series with third person narration. Which is fine by me, but what\'s the point?The romanceI\'m not a big fan of established and domestic relationships. Feyre and Rhysand literally murdered me in ACOMAF. The sexual tension, the eye fucking, the actual fucking, the ""things"" before the actual fucking, they made my little shipper heart die with happiness. And then... they became so canon, it hurts my soul. They don\'t interest me anymore. It\'s all sex and fucking and ""oh mate, my mate"" and ""oh how much I love you my Feyre"" and sky sex which was disturbing and like??? People can see you dude! You can fucking winnow and fly, just get her on a bed, or a wall (lol) or a sink or whatever floats your boat. I believe these characters\'s circle is over now. I\'m truly excited for them to have a child but I guess we\'ll see everything from another people\'s POVs now. It\'s time now forCASSIAN AND NESTA. Oh man, how much I ship this. I\'m so fucking board for this. They are my new Feyre and Rhys. I want this to happen so badly, I want to scream. Nesta pissed me off a lot in this book, but I will handle her for this ship. And because Cassian obviously loves her and I love Cassian with my entire soul. Furthermore, I don\'t know what to do with Elain, in terms of shipping. Az and Elain are cute af but I kinda want to explore the whole Elain and Lucien factor. Elain pisses me off, but I love Az and Lucien and I want to see them happy.TamlinThis book made Tamlin an unnecessary villain. It\'s like this book didn\'t have a plot or anything or someone to blame shit on so just blame it all on Tamlin. Don\'t get me wrong, I fucking hate his guts. I appreciated what he did in ACOWAR, he kinda redeemed himself, but I still don\'t like him. Nonetheless, there is no point in what\'s happening to him. Everyone is casting him out. He doesn\'t have any friends, his home is a graveyard, his people hate him. And you know, he isn\'t the worst. We\'ve seen worst villains redeem themselves. He\'s just a controlling and manipulative asshole who can\'t control his temper. He didn\'t hurt Feyre or Rhys. I want to see what will happen to his character, but Sarah has villainized him too much.The humorThis book was funny af. Hence my rating. The Amren peeing scene, the sauna scene, the ""Illyrian babies"" scene, the painting Rhys nude scene, the Feyre and Cassian drunkly decorating scene, the gifts exchange scene. It was all hilarious and fluffy and happy and it\'s something I needed. I have come to love these characters so much and I feel their inner circle as my home. I was truly happy to see them domestic and healing their wounds after the war. But, nonetheless, there was not a book needed for this. All these scenes could have been included in the fourth book. But, you know, money is important.Basically, this book was a character driven tease which gave us nothing! Honestly, we see things beginning and then we are given NOTHING. I want to know, I want to know everything. This book was diverse to anything Sarah has ever written. I was expecting this BOOM to happen but nothing. A big huge pile of shit and nothing. The book fourth snippet at the end was the most interesting part of this book. We kinda see what the next series is gonna be about. But still, not ENOUGH. Honestly, people, don\'t pay money for this book. It was too expensive for its size and importance. This is why I never read novellas and extra books to series. They mostly add nothing to the story. ANYWAY, till the next book in the A Court of Thorns and Roses series, which will be late af, K BYE!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is a great catch with the main heroes of the series. The last book was an all-out epic. This one, though a lot shorter, is still filed with SJM‚Äôs great storytelling and character development.So far, I have seen all these characters in the worst possible situations and facing incredible odds. Making great sacrifices and the legendary lengths they would go through to achieve their goals and protect those they love. Now, when they have ‚Äúwon‚Äù, the work of rebuilding, forgiveness, and moving on from the losses suffered.Yes there is no where near as much action in this book, and the characters are not moved along as much as I would have wanted but the are definitely important issues uncovered her that need to be explored later. This is more of ‚Äúwet the appetite‚Äù for the next huge chapter, but almost as importantly a much need to assess where the characters are right now in themselves and to each other.Though Feyre and Rhysand embrace their fate together. Others rebel against a fate they have not chosen with their very souls. These are the first steps in building a new world. A great point to catch up with everyone as they set their path for the future, to forget their past, or simply (stubbornly) deny fates chosen path.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'First, technically speaking, why was this book necessary? What was the plot?Was thereeven a plot? SJM said this novella is a bridge between Feysand‚Äôs story and the next story in this world, but what exactly did it bridge?All I got from this book is anger and a gag reflex.If you‚Äôve seen my ratings, updates, or followed me at all on here, you know I wasobsessedwith ACOMAF. It was all I talked about for about a year, from the moment I read it.I basically hated the other two books, but I loved the second one, and got so attached to feysand.But, good god, it is justnot possiblethat the person who wrote ACOMAF is the same one who wrote ACOWAR&ACOFAS. (Yes I‚Äôm hinting at a conspiracy theory).Like, ACOWAR was bad, but I still had some attachments to Feysand, even though Rhys was kind of a douche even then.But this? This wasbad.let me just saythis book is not a fantasy book. It‚Äôs a contemporary set in a different world. no fantastic elements other than flying (and even that was only mentioned for the purpose of a sex scene) were present in this book.Feyre didn‚Äôt use her powers even once. You‚Äôd think she‚Äôd use this time to practice and perfect her abilities, but no. She might as well be human.Butwhat annoyed me most about this book (and ACOWAR too tbh) is the complete regression of the characters.Feyre went back to roaming around the house doing nothing all day, Mor isstillhiding herself for no apparent reason‚Äî homophobia is not even a thing in this world and even if it were we all know the Inner Circle would accept her no matter what, so what‚Äôs the point?, Nesta went back to her old self (though I kind of get that), Amren lost all her strength and fierceness and just sits around doing jigsaw puzzles, and Rhys, oh god, Rhys. HOW IN THE WORLD is this sleazy, sex crazed douchebag supposed to be the same loving, caring, supportive Rhysand from ACOMAF? He couldn‚Äôt gotwo sentenceswithout making some unnecessary innuendos, talking about how good Feyre feels, how he can‚Äôt stand being around her without fucking her or how he dicked her in the sky while flying (???).His entire first chapter in this was him sulking and whining because he doesn‚Äôt get to fuck Feyre daily.*insert the world‚Äôs smallest violin*But putting that aside, let‚Äôs talk about how ‚Äú‚Äùfeminist‚Äù‚Äù he is.(I just wanna note that I know I still loved Rhys (less, but still loved him) after ACOWAR even though all those issues were present there too. It was just a little more subtle and I was still on that Feysand rush since I‚Äôd read ACOMAF only a month before. Now enough time has passed and ACOFAS has really solidified Rhys‚Äô problematic behavior in my mind and I can see it for what it truly is.)In ACOMAF, he said [about Feyre]‚ÄùMy equal in every way; she would wear my crown, sit on a throne beside mine.Never sidelined, never designated to breeding and parties and child-rearing.My queen.‚Äù(page 621).And what do you know, in ACOFAS she isconstantlysidelined,andtrying for a child.In fact, the beginning of this bookreallyparallels the beginning of ACOMAF. I mean, yeah, Feyre‚Äôs in a better mental state for sure, but she still sits around the house being bored, or painting, or designing a house, while Rhysand is out there dealing with all the politics. Direct quotes from the book-‚Äùperhaps I‚Äôd use the day to organize things. Find room for everything.‚Äú‚ÄúHigh Lady of the Night Court, Defender of the Rainbow and the ‚Ä¶ Desk.‚Äù[Rhys walks in while Feyre‚Äôs in bed] ‚ÄúRight where I left you‚Äù... ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it all I‚Äôm good for?‚ÄùLike, are you fucking kidding me? Yeah, you crowned her High Lady, but the reality is that you never involve her in anything big. You just have her clean and do some paperwork. She‚Äôs a housewife. That‚Äôssoooofeminist of you! High Lord of the Feminist Court!Basically,Sarah J Maas made Rhys such a supporter of women in ACOMAF to make the difference between Tamlin and him even clearer, and once we all switched to Rhys‚Äô side she figured she could just drop the act.Well, I got some news for you Sarah. It doesn‚Äôt work that way. Your readers aren‚Äôt dumb.And also, can we talk about the whole period thing? It was really cool to see such an open discussion about it in a book (no sarcasm this time) but... the idea that it makes women completely incompetent? Not so much. And that cheesy scene of him stroking her hair while she‚Äôs in pain? I almost puked.Oh and for god‚Äôs sake don‚Äôt get me started on the sisters!!!First of all- Leave! Nesta! Alone!She‚Äôs been traumatized, and she doesn‚Äôt wanna be around the Inner Circle because it‚Äôs a constant reminder of what she‚Äôd gone through. Feyre of all people should know what that feels like. But no, she keeps pressuring her and practically blackmailing her so she would come.And Cassian chasing her down her street even though she asked him to leave her alone multiple times.These people can‚Äôt respect a woman‚Äôs simple request for privacy. but hey, they have a High Lady! Yay Feminism!And I am just disgusted by how Elain is treated in this book.She is constantly pressured by Feyre to give Lucien a chance even though she repeatedly and explicitly says she‚Äôs not interested. But Feyre doesn‚Äôt let up because he‚Äôs a ‚Äúgood male‚Äù.Again, Feyre is such a feminist Icon!Not to mention how much Elain is belittled and ridiculed in this. She may be naive, but she‚Äôs not dumb! she‚Äôs not a child! They all (excluding Azriel, the only pure soul in this mess) keep treating and speaking to her like she‚Äôs a four year old!!!I have more thoughts but I‚Äôm so angry that I can‚Äôt even make them into a coherent sentence and this is getting too long anyway, so the bottom line is, I only care about Azriel now, but even if there‚Äôs a book about him, count me out because I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm just done with Sarah J. Maas books.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3.5 StarsSo...I\'m not in a reviewing mood at ALL; but I figured I better lay something down here before I completely forget any thoughts I have about this book and my experience reading it.I had a hard time rating this.Because, well, it just didn\'t blow my mind.That said.While I didn\'t love it...While I didn\'t really, really, reallylikeit per se...I didappreciateit.And here\'s why.Prior to receiving my copy in the mail and, obviously, reading the book, I received Maas\' subscriber newsletter email. In it she had the usual ""woo hoo, it\'s release day"" fodder they all send out, but it also contained - what I would later discover upon finishing the book - was exactly what was depicted in the ""Acknowledgements"" section.In it, she talked about the process of writing this book and how hard it was because, in the midst of it, her father had a major health scare and almost died. Still, despite this trying time - she also found out she was pregnant - and, despite not really always ""feelin\' it,"" Maas trudged through the writing process because DEADLINE.As someone who loves to write and also lost a parent in the past, I just really empathized with the creative struggle Maas probably had here.Now, am I saying that an author\'s personal life issues should be taken into account when rating/reviewing or considering your own enjoyment of a book?Hell no.Of course not.Absolutely not.I\'m just saying that, FOR ME, reading about that just changed the mindset I started the book with.I went in knowing that, by her own admission, Maas struggled writing it.So I guess you could say that 1) lowered my expectations bar, and 2) made me read the book knowing Maas had been experiencing personal pain while writing it.And I think that emotion was definitely captured in the story.This book will NOT blow your mind.It does NOT really move the plot forward.But what it did do, in my opinion, was move the CHARACTERS forward.It really drilled down into a lot of their inner thoughts and longstanding issues and baggage and - as someone who loves character driven stories - I really enjoyed that aspect of the book.Also, I mentioned this in a status update while reading, but for some reason, I am REALLY intrigued by Nesta\'s character.She was totally selfish in book one and has continued to be heinously bitchy throughout the series, but there is just something about her strength, stubbornness, and just plain fucking resolve that I love. For whatever reason, I am just sometimes drawn to complex, fucked up, misunderstood female characters that everyone else hates. And I can\'t WAIT for the next book.In fact, I think the character development done in this book is going to act as a veritable buttress to the next books in the series and make them even better for its existence, as meh as it might have been plot/action-wise.So yeah, I guess I had more to say than I thought.

Anytime those people were mentioned, my interest in the book rose. Unfortunately, since they are indeed not part of the inner circle, their presence in this was either non-existent or minuscule.This book was said to bridge the gap between what happened in previous books and the next ones. I somewhat agree that there is a sense of direction as to what the next book is going to be about but most of what happened in this had no bearing on that. Honestly, I believe this novella wasn‚Äôt necessary and SJM should have written a full book. This book had so many unnecessary fillers.What to expect- Feyre shopping- Feyre and Rhysand having dirty thoughts about themselves all the time/doing dirty things to themselves. The sex scenes/thoughts in this series used to give me anxiety because I did not want to read about that but in this, it was just annoying and old- Feyre painting- Feyre being sad that she was rich- Rhysand being ‚Äòperfect‚Äô- To mix things up: Illyrian drama, Tamlin being sad, Nesta being annoying.Things I liked- My kind, loyal Lucien: I loved reading about him (mostly from other people talking about him) and I loved his brief appearance.- I liked reading about Tamlin even though it was mostly depressing. I have a feeling his situation is going to change soon.- I think among the inner circle, Azriel is my favourite and I loved reading about him. I‚Äôm curious about his shadows.- I like Eris‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know why, I tried not to but I can‚Äôt help it. I think there is more to him than meets the eye.- I liked Feyre when she was not with/thinking about Rhysand. She‚Äôs actually a really nice and caring person.Now to get to some details- I know ACOTAR was beauty and the beast retelling but Tamlin in this gave me 'pre-belle' beast vibe with how lonely and depressing him and his court is. So hopefully, his belle would come soon üíï- I honestly don‚Äôt think Feyre did that much damage in the spring court to warrant the current state- I used the ship Nesta with Cassian like most people do but while reading this, I realized that I only shipped them because of the tension they have together. I used to like Nesta because I found her intriguing but she was so annoying in this and I honestly don‚Äôt know why Cassian still likes her. He deserves better and I honestly started shipping him with that girl at the shop smh- I also used to Ship Elain with Lucien but she‚Äôs so rude to him. No one is saying you have to be with him but at least be nice. He also deserves better- I don‚Äôt ship Azriel with Elain because their relationship gives me family vibe and not romantic. Especially with the comment about his mother- I still can‚Äôt believe Mor hasn‚Äôt told Azriel the truth..Until she does that, I don‚Äôt think I can like her.- I‚Äôm tired of being sad for Lucien. I really hope in the next books, we see him being happyOverall, if you‚Äôre a Feysand fan, you‚Äôll probably really like this but I‚Äôm not so it was eh.This book wasn't worth my excitement and not just because Lucien was there for like 2 pagesP.Sare we ever going to know how rhysand became the most powerful high lord in history? or at least how that was provenPre-readingThis comes in exactly 2 weeks.

A ‚ÄãCourt of Silver Flames (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #4)
",Sarah J. Maas,4.47,1530793,9033,"Fantasy, Romance, Romantasy, Fiction, Fantasy Romance, Audiobook, Fae",757,16-02-2021,"Nesta Archeron has always been prickly-proud, swift to anger, and slow to forgive. And ever since being forced into the Cauldron and becoming High Fae against her will, she's struggled to find a place for herself within the strange, deadly world she inhabits. Worse, she can't seem to move past the horrors of the war with Hybern and all she lost in it.The one person who ignites her temper more than any other is Cassian, the battle-scarred warrior whose position in Rhysand and Feyre's Night Court keeps him constantly in Nesta's orbit. But her temper isn't the only thing Cassian ignites. The fire between them is undeniable, and only burns hotter as they are forced into close quarters with each other.Meanwhile, the treacherous human queens who returned to the Continent during the last war have forged a dangerous new alliance, threatening the fragile peace that has settled over the realms. And the key to halting them might very well rely on Cassian and Nesta facing their haunting pasts.Against the sweeping backdrop of a world seared by war and plagued with uncertainty, Nesta and Cassian battle monsters from within and without as they search for acceptance-and healing-in each other's arms.","[{'rating': 1, 'content': '‚ú®hardcore Nesta and Cassian fans need not engage. shoo !!‚ú®She drew up short. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not afraid of anything.‚Äùbut you will be afraid of me when I rant about you. bitch.Now on to the point which is this book. Oh, this book. Oh, this damn, freaking pathetic book. This has been: One of the worst experiences of my life. I\'m freaking salty and I need a refund of my expectations.Let me make something clear. This book actually made me realize that iusedto like the original trilogy a lot. But - SJMruined every. single. thing.She ruined everything good about those precious, loveable books and characters. So, now I just hate everyone üòäNow, what are the actual good things in this book you may askanything that is not Cassian, Nesta, Mor, Amren, Feyre, Rhysand‚Ä¢ LUCIEN‚Ä¢ AZRIEL‚Ä¢He said Feyre Darling and she told him no goodbyes Rhys‚Ä¢ the endThis book was entriely useless. Things this book has include:‚Ä¢ cringey talk‚Ä¢ Nesta and Cassian (what\'s their ship name?) scaring me to death.‚Ä¢ bad, horribly redundant writing‚Ä¢ Nesta\'s inner fire blah blah‚Ä¢ Nesta eating my brain‚Ä¢Cassian\'s cock rubbing against the seam of his pantsevery two pages (literally i\'m not even joking)‚Ä¢ bad sex‚Ä¢ Nesta screaming about how she sucks‚Ä¢ mate‚Ä¢ Nesta thinking she owns the world‚Ä¢ everyone looking at Nesta and falling to their knees (hulk smash)‚Ä¢ everyone looking at Nesta and sayingmother save you(i will gouge my eyes out if i have to read ""mother save you"" ever again)‚Ä¢ Nesta getting a new superpower every 50 pages. i mean it.‚Ä¢ NESTA AND CASSIAN BEING OH SO PRETTY‚Ä¢ a lot of boring girl talk‚Ä¢ Cassian and Nesta doing it everywhere‚Ä¢ boring Nesta things which i skipped‚Ä¢ Nesta being a bitch the entire book and doing inexcusable shit and then apologizing in the last 50 pages or sth and suddenly everyone forgives herrr‚Ä¢ some boring side characters‚Ä¢ an absolutely boring plotline (non-existent is a better word)‚Ä¢ and as soon as things between Nesta and Cassian are resolved, the plot was dissolved into thin airBasically, this book sucked. badly. I wanted to crawl into a freaking hole and die. My eyes are literally bleeding from the amount of stupidity in this book.AND THE SIMILARITIES I CAN DRAW BETWEEN THIS BOOK AND ACOMAF(but let\'s be real ACOMAF is superior with a really good plotline, an actual love letter for people to heal, good chemistry, excellent characters and with an amazing ending).Firstly - Nesta and Cassian:Nestaaaaaaaaaaaa. THE BITCH. She did nothing, nothing while Feyre provided for them AND STILL, SHE BLAMES EVERY SINGLE PERSON. Like she was mad that Feyre found a new family but basically Nesta did everything in her power to push Feyre out of the picture when they were human. I do get it that some people protect themselves by using angry words or whatever BUT to me she just seemed like aselfish bitch. And when everyone finally grew sick of her bullshit she\'s like: oh my god everyone hates me.Yes, I do. I do hate you.(Update:Someone told me i was being disrespectful towards people who suffer from PTSD. Well, it certainly wasn\'t what I was saying but if, in anyway, my words have hurt you then I\'m extremely sorry.BUT Nesta\'s PTSD doesn\'t justify her behavior. Let me take an example from this book. Isn\'t tam-tam suffering from PTSD? But the way she treated him? Was that perfectly fine? The point is that this isn\'t only about her PTSD. She wasn\'t suffering from such a thing before going into the Cauldron. If you read ACOTAR from the beginning, you\'ll see what kind of character Nesta was from page 1. If she treated other people suffering from depression like Feyre, Tamlin, oh the way she talks to Lucien then how can anyone even expect that I give her space - when she doesn\'t give that to others?)and just to show her ‚ú®superior powers‚ú®we are constantly told that:‚Ä¢ Amren shivered (ohhh scary)‚Ä¢ her power ... is death herself (dramatic much?)‚Ä¢ Rhysand\'s face grew white (*eye roll*)‚Ä¢ Mother save you all (okay but pls shut up with that line)At this point, I am fucking begging SJM on my knees to stop making every single person in her world the epitome of power.and her POV was so boring. IS THIS CHARACTER GROWTH? :‚Äô) I could watch the grass grow instead of this. It was so bland after she had mentioned about 1000 times in only the first 200 pages thatshe is angry. Okay we get it. Now stop. But sadly Nesta didn\'t stop. All she could think about was: Cassian\'s cock, how unworthy she is (for his cock),the fire within her wanting to burstttttt or sth. ffs. I have never read a book more redundant than this.We were at the 600+ page mark and still Nesta didn‚Äôt change ONE BIT. All her character growth came out of the blue in the last 50 pages which just felt like the dumbest, most miserable attempt at making her seem better (it failed btw).the girl said to Elain:‚ÄúSpare me the bullshit, please.‚ÄùI read in a review that Elain didn\'t try to help Nesta. SHE DID. She was there for her. but Ms. Prissy Princess was too into herself to see that. And then she kept raving about Elain choosing Feyre yeah yeah shut up.and she literally said Cassian tastes like crackling embers?? C R A C K L I N G E M B E R S. and then fire roared in her blood and there was an extremely cringey makeout scene after that. Oh, the sex scenes were so cringey, i skipped them whole üòå‚úäand then there‚Äôs Cassian. I used to LIKE Cassian, I LIKED his jokes and attitude.But SJM being SJM turned him from an interesting character into a sex addict. He makes such stupid jokes the entirety of the book, and there is a single thought in his head: his cock. üëèüëèüëè he has zero sense, idk why people even like him in this book. I was so sick of reading every two minutes that he wants to fuck Nesta OKAY WE GET IT NOW MOVE ON THINK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. MY GOOD SIR YOU ARE A GENERAL OF AN ARMY OF THE BIGGEST COURT IN PRYTHIAN. DO YOU SERIOUSLY NOT HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO DO?Secondly ‚Äì the plot that never was:Their world used to be so interesting to me and I don‚Äôt gaf what anyone else says, the entire concept of courts and worlds and gahh I loved it and I wanted to know more about it.But instead of discovering more about this world, we spend 700 pages reading Nessian fucking each other in every position instead of discovering more about this world. I WISH the plot was given the attention it needed but sadly ‚Äì it wasn‚Äôt. Basically, everything that happened in the (non-existent) plot was to give Nesta more superpowers *rolls eyes*This is in no way a fantasy, even labeling it as such is an atrocity. NOTHING HAPPENS IN TERMS OF PLOT.Thirdly - Rhysand:And then there\'s the elephant in the room.Rhysand. I cannot for the life of me believe this is the same person from the previous books. If a man treated me the way Rhysand treated the women around him in this book, i would eat him alive. And this is a major statement coming from me since I loved Rhysand to the point of pasting his face all over my house and I spent all my teenage years worshipping on his shrine.SJM gave his character a 180 degree turn from the man we all met and fell in love with in ACOMAF. Is this the same man who helped Feyre heal in ACOMAF? YOU\'RE ACTUALLY TELLING ME THAT RHYSAND WOULD DO THIS TO FEYRE? Do y\'all remember chapter 54 of ACOMAF? Do y\'all remember all the things he did for her? How in seven hells is this the same person?I will never in a million lifetimes forgive SJM for destroying one of my favourite characters. A character i genuinely loved, a character i cried over, a character itrusted- now forever destroyed. RIP Rhysand.And this isn\'t just the problem with Rhysand. SJM made the entire Inner Circle go from people who suffered and were full of empathy for others to these immature childish bastards whose sole purpose is to somehow berate Nesta.Conclusion:Lucien and Azriel are the only good things left in this book, they are my precious babies whom i will protect till the day i die AND IF SOMEONE SAYS ONE BAD THING ABOUT LUCIEN AGAIN, YOU BETTER BELIEVE I WILL RIP THE FABRICS OF THE WORLD TO EAT THAT PERSON ALIVE.I\'ve said it before, i\'ll say it again. Mass is not a bad writer. I love her ToG series (her superior series btw). She\'s good when she wants to be and I just wish she bothered writing ACOSF and writing Nesta‚Äôs character and her journey in a more believable way.You can\'t argue with the fact that Nesta is a pretty toxic character whose redeeming qualities came at about page 600+ after doing inexcusable shit the entirety of the book and for me that\'s too late. And then there\'s the matter of everyone around her being so fuckingdisgusting, i don\'t even know who I dislike more.What this world needs is for these 500-year-old hooligans (who haven‚Äôt learnt a single thing in their entire millennia of living) to step aside and let ME rule the Night Court (I‚Äôd be a better leader than any of them anyway) with Azriel by my side.Let\'s just hope the next book is A HUGE BOOK ABOUT AZRIEL because no one deserves it more than him üò≠ Pls SJM give him the book he deserves.------------that cover is 2020 in the flesh'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Spoilers hidden because I‚Äôm not a dickThis review gonna be a lili bit of raving about this book by itself VS ranting how it was as a continuation of Maas‚Äôs seriesHonestly, my biggest challenge going into this book was all my preconceptions of this world and its characters.The stakes were high.Cassianis one of the biggest favorites in the fandomWhereas Nesta has a reputation for being a....So going into it, the book was better when I tried to block out all the nasty shit in previous books and high expectations.This isn‚Äôt the start of a new ‚ú®Maas‚ú®series, just a standalone romance happening in same world.I highly recommend that mindset cuz then it's less disappointing. Moving on,ÍßÅThe CharactersÍßÇI have never likedNesta Acheron. sorry not sorry. I didn‚Äôt like her much in the previous books but I acknowledge that her character has potential for such depth that Maas really tried to develop here.But did it work?Typically these characters dynamics would usually have me ‚ú®screaming‚ú®with a bloodthirsty heroine and spitfire cocky guy who always comes back for her!!I‚Äôve always loved Cassian. But i didnt*quite*love his POV.I felt like thru an attempt of making his character more dimensional, we lost some of his key characteristics as the flirtatous badasswho uses humor and adrenaline to cope... Yes it was amazing getting insight into his thoughts and Maas‚Äôs writing style easily adopted this dual perspective. I just wish we got more of the Cassian that trained Freye and let her punch out as needed while cracking jokes at Rhysands expensive.Maas is known for her growling, purring, overprotective, asshole, alpha males. BUT I LOVEEE ITTTTAnd his relationship with Nesta was so well developed. He knows Nesta as a victim, killer, broken girl, self-sufficient woman, and general badass.He's seen it alll and he keeps coming back for her.Together, these two were the perfect combination fora hot chaotic relationshipthat had you swooning, cackling, and gasping.I don't think Nesta will ever be my fav characterhowever her story really speaks to mental health for someone who reacts/protects themselves with sharp words and angerSome describe Nesta as ambitious and authoritative character but to me she was veryselfish, cold, and distant. She did nothing to help Feyre provide for their family and spent the money Freye earned on frivolous items. THEN in fey world went on whole refusing to train/ help others but demanding they protect ONE of her sisters?!*fuck off*In this book, She*finally*had moments of -well i‚Äôm tired of not being able to protect myself. LIKE YES BITCH THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL BEEN SAYING THIS WHOLE TIMESo on that element, I was sooo glad she was actually making progress and decisions!At the same time, I found myself disappointed with the Inner Circle*gasp*I know, I was sad about it too. I understood why they were done with her shit. Because, same.But the constant bashing of Nesta's drinking, sex, and weight were low blows especially compared to the violence and weight loss Freyre went thru. hypocrites much? I fully recognize this isn‚Äôt reflective of the characters we knowbut its Nesta‚Äôs perspective of the charactersacting towards her...*Shrug*ÍßÅThe Maas QualityÍßÇHonestly, sad to report no major twists. It was just a really good, borderline dark, romance driven by character development and lottttasexy sexy fun timessince its not longer YAIf I had just randomly picked this up, then this book would‚Äôve been off the charts with such dynamic characters, beautiful worldbuilding, and an okay plot.But in comparison with her others, this book seemed kinda basic and was missing some intricate detail plot twists that you usually can count on with Maas.To sum up it was an epic story of redemption-- Of a girl finding herself again after tragedy. And along the way she makes friends, and a lover who listens to her who supports her rough recovery, and not always her actions.Somehow this book felt soooo long and overly descriptive.. but also was not enough. No idea how that happens but there it is.The next threat/enemy makes logical sense. So I liked thatI wanted Nesta to get fierce FOR her sisters and be finally willing to fight FOR them. I lovesome badass sisters dynamicsof teasing each other, bitching at each other but would do anything for each other in the end!Didn't really quite get that.I was constantly underwhelmed by Nesta. She talks lotta shit but what has she actually done?She has continuously refused to show initiative in her own life and failed to provide for herself. Instead, she constantly chose to lean on the resources of others for her survival.All she has done is complain.Complainabout her human life while refusing to work and save herself or her sisters.Complainabout the happiness her lili sister found while refusing to be part of it.Complainabout the only people willing to fight and save humans while refusing to train or learn to fight FOR HERSELF.iM bOrEd and AnGeReD by the dismissive bullshit that defined her character up to this point in the seriesThis book showed some sparks of greatness! Taking initiative in her life! Using all that spitfire and backbone to make something for herself! But in the end, it kinda failed to live up to the fierce powerful Nesta I was hoping she would transform into.Reading this book you can‚Äôt help but compare to Maas‚Äô other great heroines.I think the big difference is that Aelin always kept moving forward. And Bryce was a little shit. But Nesta handled her depression by freezing and becomingnasty.Which is just really hard to read sometimes.Overall, I‚Äôm glad I read this book but it won‚Äôt be a major re-read like most Maas books. The book stands on the friendship the characters build, Nesta overcoming her despair and FINALLY developing her interesting powers. I greatly enjoyed the character dynamics of how Cassian and Nesta are such strong complex characters, but I wanted their romance to be more epic and to sweep me away. I love this world and all the creatures and BADASS FEMALE WARRIORS but the plot was lacking and I hate the power change that a lot of Maas‚Äô characters are undergoing.If you are teetering whether to read this book, I gotta tell you to lower your expectations and try to forget the bullshit of Nesta‚Äôs past in order to just fully enjoy this book. It was pretty great seeing the Inner Circle‚Äôs relationships in the aftermath of Wings and Ruin, especially through Nesta‚Äôs harsh eye that hardcore READS THESE BITCHES and all their flaws. Plus it gives some foreshadowing and builds excitement for which characters might be next.It was a good romance, but it wasn‚Äôt a great Maas book.ALSO I‚ÄôM STIL FRIGGEN PISSED ABOUT THAT COVER-------------------------------------------------------------------------Pre-Book thoughtsI have never likedNesta.sorry not sorry. I didn‚Äôt like her much in the previous books but I acknowledge that her character does have potential for such depthSome describe Nesta as ambitious and authoritative character but to me she was veryselfish, cold, and distant. She did nothing to help Feyre provide for their family and spent the money Freye earned on frivolous items. THEN in fey world goes on whole refusing to train/ help others but demanding they protect ONE of her sisters?!*fuck off*Just the idea of a sister knowingly fucking over another in how she treated Freyre as human for YEARS ... it actually hurts my heart a little bit .... that kinda selfishnessBut Cassian liking her will probably MAKE me like her more*god i hope so cuz he deserves the best*I just sick of Nesta's unrelenting nastiness while also hoping she resolves her trauma and that Cassian finds the happiness he deservesWish listIt‚Äôd be kinda cool to find out that she was doing something‚Äîsacrificing‚Äîto help the familythat Freyre never knewback when they were humans behind the wallShe just needsSOME redeeming qualityfor all the times she constantly bitching and lashing out at everyone. Some reason for why the whole Cassian ignoring thing and treating her sis Feyre like dirt*shaking my fucking head*Also generally she way 2 protective and angry towards people for there not to be some sorta backstory or event behind it hahahCover:ehhh I not really a fan of this style... also don‚Äôt think it really suited for Cassian with the hardcore Autumn court theme and colors. This just seems like such a let-down and step-down compared to the artful creativity and beauty of Crescent City*frowny face*But its Maas so of courseeeee imma read it*duhhhh*""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""EDIT: this kind of blew up so I just wanted to say that if you're one of those people writing essays in the comment section to try to change my mind: I don't care lol üò≠ good for you for being passionate about something but I'm not here to read a think piece on why you disagree, stream red velvet tho xThe following will contain major spoilers.Nobody is surprised. I knew absolutely nothing would make this book good, save SJM deciding not to write it altogether.Now, I have to make it clear upfront: IloveNesta. I really resonate with the way that she deals with her own emotions and is consequently treated by the people around her. That being said, I loathe SJM‚Äôs books. I only begrudgingly pushed through this for Nesta, and even that wasn‚Äôt worth it.Nothingcould have made this worth it.I‚Äôm not here to give a criticism of the plot or politics, because I‚Äôm sure nobody cares (I don‚Äôt). I‚Äôm also not here to judge the sex aspect of this book, although I know many people have chosen to critique that. Instead, I‚Äôd like to cover the three cardinal sins this book committed:respect, rebirth, and rhysand.RespectACOSF starts off with our heroine using drinking and sex as her coping mechanism. The third book in the ACOTAR trilogy left our main characters, especially Nesta, heavily traumatized. She witnessed her good-for-nothing father come back after he didnothingfor her or her sisters as children and try to fight Hybern. She watches as he dies in front of her. She watches as thousands of Illyrian soldiers die. She watches as Cassian is nearly killed multiple times in front of her. She‚Äôs underweight, depressed, has PTSD, and gets shit all because of it.No, in fact, she‚Äôspunishedfor it.The straw that broke the camels back is the fact that she spent 500 gold on beer and gambling. Now, the problem isn‚Äôt that she drank or gambled. It‚Äôs that she used this money-which is HILARIOUS considering that Rhysand owns five houses and pays each Inner circle member a salary that is so grotesquely huge it‚Äôs described in previous books as being more than they‚Äôll ever need in their lifetimes. Rhysand is even completely fine with the fact that Velaris is full of so-called ‚Äúslums‚Äù but oh, no, NESTA can‚Äôt be living in one! It‚Äôs fine if poor people exist, she‚Äôs just not allowed to be one of them because it‚Äôs ‚Äúembarrassing‚Äù to them. Obviously, they cut her off completely, DESTROYED the entire neighborhood she lived in (has anyone wondered what the fuck happened to the other people living there lmao? are they just homeless now?), and ship her off to a sexist, homophobic war camp with the one person she doesn‚Äôt want to be around because being depressed is just /such/ a sin.She is repeatedly berated by every member in the court. Some lovely examples:>Cassian tells her that everyone ‚Äúfucking hates (her)‚Äù and later makes this out to be ‚Äúoh, I just said that but I didn‚Äôt really mean it.‚Äù>During one of their sex scenes she asks him if his friends won‚Äôt be angry with him for sleeping with her because she‚Äôs so aware of the fact that they hate her.>‚ÄúPerhaps you can find it in yourself to try a little harder this year.‚Äù>He jokes that she might order him to kill himself, and she asks him if he really thinks she‚Äôs capable of that. Because this entire time they‚Äôve made her feel like sheisa monster.>Mor tells her that she ‚Äúnever deserved the benefit of the doubt that good people like (Cassian) give her‚Äù and also says that she should be thrown into the court of nightmares. For anyone unaware, the court of nightmares is where her homophobic and abusive family is.>Amren constantly makes fun of her appearance and berates her for having sex. She tells her she looks awful at every opportunity, and always chalks it up to be because she sleeps around and drinks too much.>Rhysand gets his own section for abhorrent comments.There is no end to it. Every chapter brought a character insulting her for justexisting.Her weight problems are described fucking atrociously. The first time Cassian even sees her in the book he comments on how she‚Äôs ‚Äúskin and bones‚Äù but guys, he still wants to tap that. Every time her weight is mentioned is either to insult her for starving herself because, need I remind you, she‚Äôs DEPRESSED, or it‚Äôs for Cassian to point out while he talks about how hot she is.All of this. All 768 pages of insult after insult after humiliation and pointless paragraphs forNestato apologize tothem.Because it‚Äôs /her/ fault she‚Äôs depressed. It‚Äôs /her/ fault she has PTSD. It‚Äôs /her/ fault and she needs to change for everyone else. Because everyone forced her to leave against her will because theylovedher, something they make sure to remind her of every single damn chapter. Nesta is disrespected by everyone throughout the entire book and is rewarded for it by being the one who must respect them instead.RebirthYou have no idea how excited I was back when I was an ACOTAR fan and Nesta was rebirthed as a High Fae and got her powers from the cauldron. It was like watching someone so similar to me-someone who was mean, and opinionated, andboldhold all the power in the world. I wanted to see how SJM would write her journey of becoming physically and mentally strong-of mastering her powers.We see glimpses of it. How her eyes shine with fire. How she sears the stairs she walks on with a single finger. The light emanating from her. The way she is single-handedly more powerful than Rhysand, who was said to be the strongest High Lord. It was incredible.And then she gave it all up.That‚Äôs it. Journey‚Äôs over. She gave up all of the power she had, but not before using it to mutate her pelvis so that she would be able to birth an Illyrian baby without dying.Yeah. That‚Äôs all.RhysandI have never met a character whom I loathe more than Rhysand. Perfect, feminist king Rhysand who loves giving women a choice so long as they pick the one he wants them to. He‚Äôs the most worthless, pathetic, egomaniac asshole I‚Äôve ever read about. His name is mentioned 791 times, which is 791 times too many.It‚Äôs made very clear from the get-go that he hates Nesta. He‚Äôs aggressive toward her in a way that makes me want to strangle him every time he speaks. Every comment toward her or about her is an ill-intended remark.Nesta makes what he knows of him clear early on: ‚ÄúAny offering Rhysand threw her way was solely out of love for Feyre.‚ÄùWait for it, things are about to get comedic.When Nesta finds out about Feyre‚Äôs pregnancy, Rhysand looks at her threateningly, because of course he thinks she‚Äôs a danger to his kid. It says, ‚ÄúRhysand was not only male, but a Fae male, and he would eliminate any threats to his mate and child.‚ÄùHere comes the funny part‚ÄîAbsolutely hilarious to me that Rhysand wants to be the white vanilla king who loves women (and is definitely not misogynistic) and his wife SO MUCH that he hid from her the fact that her giving birth could potentially kill her.Oh yeah!Because wanting to protect your mate (gag) involves lying to her about her own body and child. He strictly forbids anyone tells her about it, so, naturally, Nesta tells her.Now, I‚Äôm not going to sit here and pretend like she had good intentions. She was just doing it to be an ass. But at least she told the god damn woman that the kid inside of her was going to KILL HER! And then, Feminist king Rhysand declared, and-I-quote, ‚ÄúGet Nesta out of this city. Right now. Before I fucking kill her.‚ÄùRound of applause for our cracker saltine lord ruler Rhyse Hall, everybody.I have no other words. No words for how every single time Nesta dared to stand up to the awful way she was treated by him Cassian would get angry ather.As if Rhys was some infallible God who could do no wrong and must never be criticized. No matter how large his wrongdoing was, it was always her fault. Always her who was the problem.I just feel like...I don't know. I like Cassian, or I did, at least. I think that a good love interest should both support the heroine and call her out when she's being a dick, but relentlessly siding against her is just so ??? What's even the point? His entire family hates her guts, and he doesn't do much to make her think otherwise or to comfort her about it. He definitely doesn't act like he doesn't share some of their views. I don't see how a male lead placing his family over his girl could be very romantic?Concluding thoughts and my 13th reasonThis is the worst book Sarah J Maas has ever written, and that‚Äôs saying a lot. From her worthless white feminism to the complete and utter mind-numbing torture I had to face through this Bible-length tome, I could not have thought of a worse thing to read. It‚Äôs sad because I truly love Nesta Archeron so much, but this book made it evident that Sarah Janet hates her and wants to give her the worst story ever. Also, Feysand baby had a stupid name. SorryEDIT:frequently asked questions so that you can stop asking them:Why would you read something you know you'll hate?It's a free country! Why did you read this entire review if you knew you would hate it? (Yes, I /am/ a miserable person. I enjoy writing hate reviews. I think it's funny)It's a fiction book, it doesn't need to be realistic.By mistreating mental illness and eating disorders in fiction you perpetuate the idea in real life. The thing is, writing about something is not an endorsement, but neither is it a condemnation. SJM could have written about these situations in a way that was respectful, but, at least in my opinion, she completely missed the mark. I'm not saying she shouldn't have written about Nesta's mental health and weight issues. I'm saying that the way she wrote about them made it seem like they were just...her fault? Do you know what I mean? Like, as someone who has received comments about my weight many times, I felt deeply uncomfortable by how people treated her.If that's what you think then what do you think about... (enter character/ship I didn't mention)?I like Gwen? I don't have any further thoughts.Do you think having mental illness excuses someone to be a bad person?Mental illness is an explanation, not an excuse. It /explains/ why Nesta wants to be left alone. It /explains/ why she has a hard time being around anyone in the Inner Circle. It /explains/ her complicated feelings toward them. Nesta was already a mean person before this book‚Äîthe actual question is whether or not any of her rude behaviorneedsto be excused in the first place. And that's for you to think on. Personally, I don't care.What Red Velvet song?All of them!""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5 - ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èIt feels like coming home after a long journey.That is precisely what I feel whenever I read aSarah J Maasbook. WhileThrone of Glassis my favorite series butACOTARis special to me. It helped me during one of the most difficult periods of my life and in particular,ACOMAF.I have no words to describe the beautiful familiarity of returning to a world you know you have always missed.I swear I could almost feel the gentle breeze of Velaris caressing me, welcoming me back while knowing that the story will start from a very dark place.Because this isNesta\'sstory.In the beginningAnd in the endThere was DarknessAnd nothing more.I will be writing two sections of the review soon:‚Ä¢ a non-spoiler section that will come first‚Ä¢ a spoiler section because I DO need to highlight some points.----------Non-spoiler review----------Nesta\'shealing journey was not a smooth one. I did not expect it to be. She clawed her way out of the the darkness that engulfed her ever since she had turned into a Fae.For her to heal, Nesta had to rip her soul apart to find her self again.I will tell you that I disliked Nesta so much in the ACOTAR books, I just kept a tight hold on the grudge against her.But Nesta is not a person that was meant to be liked. She is vicious and her sharpest weapon has always been her tongue. She could inflict a wound so deep with a mere word. But I came to realizeNesta is the most ""human"" character among all of them.Humanity does not equal good morals necessarily, Nesta is heavily flawed and her flaws are what makes her human.She is guilt-ridden to the point she allows her guilt to rot within her, poisoning most of the traits that makes her a good person. She carries such a deep disdain towards herself that she acts on it and you often see it in the form of lashing words.Why does she allow this to happen to her? Because she holds onto one belief:She deserves it.When I started seeing Nesta\'s soul more clearly after she began to tear it open, I felt my soul resonate with hers to the point that I cried.She was a prisoner in her own head, reliving certain deaths and nightmares that she can no longer see the light in the world. She can no longer see the goodness in her.It was powerful. It was raw. It was ugly.It was devastatingly beautiful in a way.That is what Nesta\'s healing looked like. She was such a damaged person inside that she gave up on the hope of healing herself.Does that mean all is forgotten about Nesta\'s past behavior? About the fact that she hurt and wronged many people? That she at many moments was a horrid person?The answer is No, and this is what makes Nesta\'s healing journey so impactful and emotional.Her trauma after the Cauldron and the War wrapped its adamant chains around her. The devastating war still haunts her and pulls her back from that light at the end of the tunnel where her family await her, a family that are bent on believing that she chose to remain in the darkness.No one was willing to go deep into the darkness to her and gift her a fragment of light that will guide her steps out.No one was willing to go as far as to shatter those chains and spare her from that misery.No one except forCassian.Nesta and Cassian\'s romance was maddening, passionate and wild.They were feral with each other, they were mad for one another, they were perfect for each other. I expected no less of them.Sarah J Maaswas not kidding when she mentioned that this was the filthiest book she has written so far.I was very impressed with her writing style, I really enjoy seeing an author\'s journey throughout the years and how much they grow. Of course, ACOSF comes with its own set of flaws and issues but it does not ruin the overall experience for me.If it shredded my emotions, if it made me cry, if my heart felt attached to this world after turning the very last page. It deserves a 5-star rating from me regardless of the issues and flaws that I will highlight in the spoiler section.Not to mention now that I adore Nesta, I adore the person she had become in the end and this is coming from a person that never liked her in the previous books.A Court of Silver Flamesis sexy, emotionally gripping and powerful.WARNINGI will go into detail about the book in the other section of this review below which will contain MAJOR SPOILERS, so please this is a heads up for those that have not read the books to not continue further unless they are willing to be spoiled.--------MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD--------Spoiler-review:The following review will be summed up in points because this is the best way to sort my thoughts and make sure I left nothing out.Yes people I am about to let it all out.Also, this is my own experience and my opinion should not be treated as a fact. To each of us their own unique reading experiences. I do not want to ruin anyone\'s experience and I do not want someone to ruin mine.So, let\'s get on with it!*ACOSF\'sbackbone wasNestaand her found family:Gwyn and Emerie. I adore their precious bond and the fact that they are badass female characters whom are also passionate readers of smutty romances. I love that Nesta found other friends outside the IC, they all found something in each other and helped one another heal.* TheHouseis my new favorite character.* Unpopular opinion but I am glad to seeRhysandplaying the High Lord role. Of course we\'d find him to be more broody since we are no longer seeing him fromFeyre\'sperspective, we are seeing him in his true element. I\'ve noticed that a few readers said they didn\'t like Rhys in this book, well.. Rhysand isn\'t the epitome of perfection many make him out to be and I appreciate that because he is heavily flawed too and yes I do like Rhysand.* My heart bursts with so much love forCassian! He wasn\'t without flaws too but I finally saw the raw version of him.* Although I was in no rush to seeFeyre\'spregnancy, yet it warmed my heart because Feyre deserves that kind of happiness after everything she went through. Of course I cried when she announced that she was pregnant I already suspected it early on.* It\'s refreshing to see theInner Circlefrom two other perspectives especially Nesta\'s and their treatment of her as if she was a hopeless case. Not saying that Nesta wasn\'t at fault here but they too are not cutting her some slack.* I think in regards to theromanceI have a few things I want to address: there were some romantic scenes that felt repetitive from ACOMAF + the intimate scenes were sometimes spicy in a good way and sometimes sloppy with weird descriptions.* I loved seeingNesta\'sgrowth because it was beautiful and ugly at the same time and you can easily notice the shifting points in her healing.* I rolled my eyes at theNessianmating bond, sorry everyone. I let it slip because I grew fond of them both but I do not want the romance to always be attached to some invisible bond. It\'s supposed to be rare we already had that with Rhys and Feyre.* Theplotdid not feel stable, it felt like it went to so many different directions. I was kind of hoping there would be more politics and human queens involved but it\'s not like I wasn\'t happy to where it ended up.* I was missing the open-conversation I was looking forward to between Nesta and the Inner Circle, both acknowledging their wrongs.* The rareRed starblasting through the sky that rattled Rhys, freaked out Cassian and the Priesstesses is none other thanAelin!.* Can we talk about the fact thatHelionwanted to enter the Night Court in a Golden Chariot led by four white horses with manes of golden fire and Rhys was like no so he settled for a Pegasus still having the best entrance of any character in the book.* the whole High King situation is a big No No. I love the dynamic of the Seasonal and Solar Courts and that what makes Prythian unique. Making Rhys a High King would ruin that and the fact that each Court is associated with its High Lord\'s power. I\'ve had it with Rhys beingthe most powerful high lord in historyso I do not need him to be upgraded to a High King especially not with using weapons that are the products of Nesta\'s power. That\'s giving Rhys way more power.* The scene that hit me the most was when Nesta let it all out. I cried because I am familiar with that level of self-loath.* I cried at the scene when Feyre was giving birth, it was intense and so emotional. Deep down I knew SJM wouldn\'t just end it here but it did not stop my heart from breaking.* The aftermath was so precious.* I do not mind thatNestalost the power she took from the Cauldron. She will lead the Valkyries whom she revived with her two other friends. She will grow even stronger without relying on powerful magic that makes her a target of other enemies. Her power has been a heavy weight lifted off her shoulders, and she gave them away in the most emotional and beautiful way.* Unpopular opinion: I have no issues withAzriel\'s POVbecause this is the first time we are exposed to his thoughts and he definitely was not OOC. Azriel is not some dark cinnamon roll, he is a deep inner turmoil. I find his notion of love and thoughts of Elain to be unhealthy. He has no experience with love besides the 500 year old unrequited love for Mor which brings me to ask... how come Az would get over Mor, his 500 year old crush just for Elain? They have not even spoken about their feelings. Anyhow, I do believe Azriel to be at a very dark place and it saddens me that many readers disliked him after this. Azriel has always kept to himself, he was never brought into the light, he does not know what love truly is. Having an Archeron sister does not guarantee the happiness his brothers found, this is a very wrong mindset.* Yes, I\'ve said it before and I\'ll say it again:Azrielneeds a ray of sunshine kind of character and we find that inGwyn. I think she is perfect for him and there is a reason SJM gave her the spotlight in his POV. Her name literally means happiness, blessing, white, fair while Az\'s is God is my help and Azrael the Angel of Death. Such a stark contrast, like yin and yang.* I hope SJM won\'t useGwyn, a SA survivor, as a plot-device for Elriel and then discard her that is too cruel.* Yes, not all Illyrian brothers should end up with every Archeron sister so I\'ll be rooting for Azriel and Gwyn in the next book.* Also, many people calledRhysa hypocrite for his actions with Azriel. No, what he did makes sense and he is pulling rank because this is how Rhys asserts his role as High Lord with a responsibility toward his court. Az ignored the Mor question, Az did not express his love or feelings towards Elain only his desire to have her and I\'m pretty sure there would\'ve been a different reaction from Rhys if Az told him that he genuinely loves her. With a baby on the way, Rhys won\'t risk any more conflicts that targets him and his family nor will he risk alliances with the other courts because of Azriel. How many times throughout the books did Rhys ask something of Azriel like to stop spying or not engage in a battle and he refuses until Rhys pulls the High Lord act on him and tells him that\'s it\'s anorder, people forget how stubborn Azriel can be.* I appreciate the fact that this book gave us a new perspective to theInner Circleand their flaws. I still adore them.I may add points later on, I\'m not quite sure I covered everything but I hope I did.Another note I would add is please be careful with posting spoilers in the comments. Try to be vague about it because it will still show on Goodreads feed to other readers that haven\'t read the book.Remember that this is my own personal experience of the book and my own personal opinions that in no way invalidate your own, so please do not invalidate mine if you do not agree with it.ACOMAF remains at the top but ACOSF managed to take over the second place, I will definitely be rereading it some time in the future.This is the longest review I have written so far, so thank you for sticking around.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '*This review contains no spoilers.*(very scared and had to edit my review after i pressed control + f and saw how many times i used the word ""fuck""). i have grammatically de-fucked this review. enjoy.)Ranting and RavingLet\'s get one thing clear: I am a hard core SJM fan. I have read and loved every book this woman has ever written. But can I be real a second? This book was shit, and I hated everything.CharactersI hatedevery single personin this book. Well, except Azriel (he can have me any day). But everyone else can die.I don\'t understand how you can make a fantastic, wonderful trilogy about love, friendship, healing, and everything beautiful in this world, and then come out with a disgusting, trashy, smutty ""romance"" that has absolutely no plot, shitty character growth,and an overall shitty book.Not to mention the cover. What is that, anyway??? An orange mask? A tiger?SJM took her perfectly developed characters and pretty much just let them rot. From the first three books, I loved every single person. Everyone. Now I hate Feyre. I hate Rhysand. I hate Cassian. I hate Amren. I hate Mor. For ** sake, IdespiseElain. Why is she a character? Why does sheexist? What does she add to the book? What role does she play, other than to collect people‚Äôs sympathy and make them feel sorry for her? I‚Äôm sorry (not), butElain is a ** idiot.I cannot STAND this hoe. Sarah, please write her death. I can\'t deal with her constant whining and bitching, running to Rhys and Cassian and telling them she wants to go back to the human world, just because of Nasty Nesta. Elain, you\'ve been living with your sister your entire life, and you choosenowto complain about how much of a bitch she is? Where were you the past eighteen years? Please, sweetie, grow a spine.I loved Feyre and Rhysso much(note *past tense*). I would\'ve done anything for them. Now I despise them with every atom in my body. The entire book is just themfucking, and Rhys bragging to Cassian that they‚Äôre fucking. And nowFeyre and Rhys have a childand now my life is over. I hated this book. I hated everything. No way I\'ve already mentioned that.On to the next bitch of the month: Cassian. Why the ** do I hate Cassian now (who I ADORED in ACOTAR)? For a simple question, there\'s an equally simple answer. Mostly because Cassian doesn\'t know how to keep his ((())) in his pants, and all he can think about is Nesta sUcKinG it and fUckInG it and doing whatever kinky shit they did that I can\'t even mention with a straight face. I hate you, Cassian. Ihateyou. Get me characters whose livesdon\'trevolve around their OTP and who think about thingsotherthan fucking, bucking and yucking the love of their life. Which‚Äînot to mention‚ÄîCassian and Nesta don\'t even seem to love each other. It\'s all about the rElEaSe for them, because apparently, these fictional bitches have so much sexual tension that they can\'t help rubbing up on each other every twenty ** pages. Bye. Every one of you nasty lil bitches disgust me.Wait, you\'restillnot done talking about the shitty characters? No bitch I\'m really not, because I\'m so angry at how many trees died for this pathetic book.The next shitty character I‚Äôll be talking about is none other than Amren the hoe and Mor the bird. I honestly feel a little bad talking shit about them just because I adored them so much in the trilogy, but this shit has got to betalkedabout!Heads-up to all those authors out there: when you are describing a character and how pOwErFuL they are, please. please.pleasedo not get other powerful characters to ""shiver"" or ""pale"" when they are around the character you want to MAKE powerful. It is the cringiest thing I have ever read in my life. It‚Äôs so painful. Come up with some unique way to describe their power and make readers admire them, NOT get powerful characters like Amren to ""shiver"" and Rhys to ""pale"" when they are around Nesta. I don\'t necessarilyhateMor and Amren, but they‚Äôve become so ** irrelevant in the fourth book that there\'s really no point talking about them anymore.Character ArcThe character growth in this book actually made me laugh. It was so minimal that it was astonishing. It was just Nesta apologizing to everyone because she realized everyone ** hated her guts and she had no one to go to. How can apologies possibly show character growth? I agree, Nesta\'s bitchy behavior throughout the book was inexcusable. However, that was why I liked her.It would\'ve been better if she continued being the bitchy little shit she was, but rushing her character growth towards the last 100 pages is stupid and inexcusable and straight up lazy, and it was a complete waste of my time.Love InterestNow let\'s get into why the ** I hate Rhysand\'s guts. Mind you, I used to love this hoe. I would‚Äôve died for him. Now? I‚Äôm just glad I was never faced with that decision. If I was in Prythian, I would rather breathe raid smoke than the same air as him.First, Rhys is the only form of character growth in this entire book. I\'m sorry, did I say character growth? I meant characterdepletion. Rhysand has accomplished it, y\'all. He has accomplished his Unbecoming. Where was that sweet, kind, playful man that helped heal Feyre and helped her and everyone around him? Where the ** did he go, because I sure couldn\'t find him.Throughout the book he also brags to Cassian about fucking Feyre nonstop. You have sentences like:""\'Feyre initiated this round.\' Cassian could hear the pure male satisfaction in Rhys\' voice as he said it.""""I dismissed the maids bc I don\'t want them hearing what we\'re up to.""Cassian, laughing: ""Give the poor female a break""Rhysand: ""We\'re taking a break.For now."" (Did this bitch really just sayfor now?)But really though, why the FUCK is this necessary? Does Sarah J. Maas think it\'s attractive for a male to talk about his partner like that? What has she done to perfectly amazing characters? I am confusion? And disappointment? Now he is an egotistical jerk, a typical overprotective alpha male (*coughs* did someone say Rowan? - I despised him in EoS), and a ** shitty ass friend.I wouldn\'t go so far to say that ACOTAR was one of my favorite fantasy series ever, but it was definitely up there. Now, it is down there. I don\'t ever want to read about these thirsty whores ever again.PlotHold up, there was a ** plot? Unfortunately, there was nothing in this book resembling anything of the sort. There was no plot whatsoever, to the point that there weren\'t even any plot holes. In order to have plot holes, you must havesomesemblance of a plot. I was justwaitingfor some crazy SJM shit to go down, for her to pull some astonishing bullshit on us, for some hoe to declare war on another hoe. But then the book just ended. And I was confused. I didn\'t understand. I thought someone had ripped the last 200 pages from the back of my book. Alas, it was not my book\'s fault. It was the author\'s.Additional PointsI woke up at 9:38 AM to write this hateful review because the hate is overwhelming. I wanted to die reading this. Nesta is oh-so-powerful because her power is ""pure death,"" as Rhys puts it. I couldn\'t stand this. The only person that was tolerable in the slightest was Azriel, who I would probably marry. But everyone else in this book has turned shitty and disgusting. The other character who Isort oflike is Nesta, who everyone says is a selfish bitch, but that\'s really the only reason why I like(d) her.I was going to reread ACOMAF and the rest of that damn series before I started this book, but now I can\'t even bring myself to, because then I\'ll just end up remembering the utter failure that was ACOSF. I\'m not putting up with these characters anymore. Y\'all can all die and I would laugh. Which is certainly a surprise, since I balled my eyes out when I thought Rhys was dead in ACOWAR. Now Imyselfwould brandish the knife on him. I‚Äôd gladly throw him in that ** cauldron while cackling and sit there watching that bitch burn (that sounds really evil and i should delete this sentence but i won‚Äôt because i‚Äôm feeling resentful and bitter)Overall, i you\'re looking for a book with some steamy, smutty romance, then by all means, this might end up being your favorite book! But for those of us who have brains and who are sensible human beings and actually likecontentin a book, with likable characters, a plot driven story ... go home. Get your money back. Don\'t even get yourself hype for this book. I walked down that path, and honestly, there is no going back.And trust me, I know how popular SJM is. I can\'t scroll through the GR homepage without seeing some unsuspecting victim starting ACOSF. People probably won\'t stop talking about it for the next few months, which is unfortunate, because it\'s trash. I genuinely feel like this dumb shit is overshadowing some really top-tier books, so I\'m going to redirect y\'all to my favorite series of all time,An Ember in the Ashes. Read all four books, it\'ll do you some good, especially after shit like ACOSF fucks with your sanity. AEITA will put this trashy, slutty book to shameful tears.-1,000 starsCheck out my new blog'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '1 STAR.Nesta Acheron is the only interesting character that SJM has ever managed to write and yet she was treated like complete and utter shit throughout this whole book.THIS IS NOT A REVIEW OF THE STORY BUT INSTEAD A DISCUSSION OF SJM‚ÄôS HORRIBLE ‚ÄúFEMINISM‚Äù AND HOW SHE DID NESTA ARCHERON DIRTY.SPOILERS BELOW.I knew before even starting this book that I would dislike the journey that SJM had obviously planned for Nesta but I elected to power through because I genuinely liked Nesta‚Äôs character and she resonated with me on a personal level. I shouldn‚Äôt have.Within the first few chapters of this book, I was already infuriated beyond belief. Not even 20 pages into the damned thing and we have Cassian, who is worried about thin and unhealthy Nesta has gotten when he suddenly goes off on a mental tangent about her ‚Äúmagnificent breasts‚Äù. What the fuck? Unfortunately for us all, this is not even the worst thing to happen to Nesta in the first chapter. We are immediately greeted with Nesta being furiously slut-shamed by her once-friend Amren and our captain feminist Rhysand agrees.‚Äú ‚ÄúThough I bet it‚Äôs hard to look good,‚Äù Amren went on, ‚Äúwhen you‚Äôre out until the darkest hours of the night, drinking yourself stupid and fucking anything that comes your way.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ Rhys seemed inclined to agree with Amren. ‚ÄúIt seems Rhysand, who is famous for always LETTING women have a choice, does not agree when it comes to women he doesn‚Äôt like. Furthermore, Amren‚Äôs blatant slut-shaming is brushed off;‚Äú - did Nesta notice the faint glimmer of worry in Amren‚Äôs smoky eyes-understand how rare it was? ‚ÄùWho literally gives a shit. I don‚Äôt care if this is the first time Amren has ever been concerned for someone, you don‚Äôt say that type of shit to your supposed friend.Poor Nesta is then evicted from her home and ordered into doing what Feyre and Captain Feminist Rhysand want or she will be forced into the human world where she has no place and would be shunned. Some sister, huh? Not only this but Feyre and Rhysand take it upon themselves to tear down a whole block of APARTMENTS where PEOPLE LIVE just because they don‚Äôt like that Nesta stays there. SJM has not even tried to stop her privilege from seeping through her characters and if I didn‚Äôt already loathe Rhysand I would most definitely be leading the mob to his door at this point. And so Nesta is forced to obey Mr ‚ÄúYou always have a choice‚Äù Rhysand and attend training with Cassian.We‚Äôll skip a few chapters; Cassian whines and lusts and does a remarkable performance as a ‚ÄúNice Guy‚Äù tm until Nesta insults his precious perfect High Lord and he tells that her everybody hates her. Everybody. Now, it‚Äôs remarkably obvious to even the characters in this god forsaken story that Nesta has been struggling after the war (after all it was the supposed reason they sent her away) and yet dear old Cassian gets upset that Nesta doesn‚Äôt like his bitch of a High Lord and tells her that everyone hates her. Everyone, you can assume, includes her sisters and himself. This gets resolved in typical SJM style with a ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean it, I was angry‚Äù apology that is literally faker than me in my online lectures.We move on to some sort of conflict and Rhysand and Co. decide to ‚Äúask‚Äù Nesta to do something incredibly dangerous, the last time she had done it resulted in the capture of her younger sister Elain. Of course, Nesta doesn‚Äôt exactly want to do that and so our quirky inner circle quickly remind her that her aforementioned sister can do instead. The sister that Nesta would die to protect, that one? Yeah. And so, our lovely little Nesta is once more forced into doing what President Feminist wants because her only other option is to sacrifice her sister‚Äôs safety. But yeah, you always have a choice, right?Speaking of choices‚Ä¶ time for the big one.It‚Äôs revealed to us that our darling couple Feysand are with child, cue cheers! Except, the baby has wings and giving birth to him will probably kill Feyre. Rhysand obviously goes around and makes everyone swear not to tell Feyre for‚Ä¶ reasons? Captain Choice not telling his wife, mate whatever, that the child she‚Äôs carrying will pretty much kill her? Feminism.Now, this stays a secret for a while until Nesta finds out that the glamorous Inner Circle have been discussing her and taking votes on what is or isn‚Äôt essential for her to know about her own powers. So, Nesta‚Äôs pissed (as she very well should be) and has a confrontation that leads to her telling Feyre the truth about her little fae baby. Shock horror, Rhysand isn‚Äôt pleased. In fact, I believe his exact words were:‚ÄúGet Nesta out of this city. Right now ‚Ä¶ Before I fucking kill her.‚ÄùCharmer.Sure, Nesta only told Feyre the truth because she was angry and wanted to hurt her, but I hardly think Nesta is the villain in this situation. Yet she‚Äôs treated like one by everyone except Feyre (this is perhaps the only time Feyre has shown some sense). Not only that, Rhysand literally threatens to kill her. When I tell you, I had to put this book down because I was SO INFURIATED, I could barely breathe. If a man ever did that shit to me, he‚Äôd be dead in a ditch. But unsurprisingly, SJM pins the blame on Nesta.When I tell you, I could rant about SJM‚Äôs purported ‚Äúfeminism‚Äù for hours I am not lying. This review could go on for another 20 pages if I wanted to. However, spending that much energy on SJM would be a new low, even for me. So, a wrap-up.A Court of Silver Flames is potentially the worst book I have ever read, especially in terms of character development. We start with Nesta, traumatised and lashing out, and what do we finish with? A Nesta who had to go and beg for everyone‚Äôs forgiveness and nobody, not once, apologised to her despite everything I‚Äôve just discussed. I think maybe Feyre apologised once and Rhysand buys her dresses at the end like ‚Ä¶ are you SHITTING me?!Throughout this story, Nesta finds her own little group of friends and this is probably the only good thing about this stupid fucking book. Nesta‚Äôs friendship with two other women was surprisingly heart-warming at times and perhaps the only thing SJM did not screw up completely.This book was a complete and utter fucking monstrosity and I sincerely hope SJM never writes another book again.Fuck you,Allana'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4.25 stars‚ÄúSo Nesta had become a wolf. Armed herself with invisible teeth and claws, and learned to strike faster, deeper, more lethally. Had relished it. But when the time came to put away the wolf, she\'d found it had devoured her too.‚ÄùI am irrationally annoyed by how much I enjoyed this.I read the reviews and was prepared to snicker my way through the purring, the ridiculous sex scenes, and constant assertions of ""my mate."" However *sigh* this series just does something to my cold cynical heart. I laugh at it, but I am incapable of hating it.So take my hand, lovelies. Let us venture into my detailed thoughts, which I have thoughtfully assembled into a list with no discernible pattern or theme:-Nesta is so bitchy sometimes. I get that it\'s complex and there\'s a certain feminism in portraying someone like her as a protagonist instead of a villain, but jeez, girl. Learn some basic manners. I occasionally wonder if SJM went too far in making Nesta the selfish stepsister in ACOTAR. It\'s hard to shake off that image. She does attempt to justify it in this book by explaining that Nesta was angry at her father for giving up and not providing for his daughters. Nesta was ready to let them all starve to prove a point-Rhys says to Nesta, ‚ÄúOf course you have a choice. You always have a choice here,‚Äù like he didn‚Äôt force Nesta out of her flat, force her to live in one of his residences where she can\'t leave, force her to train with Cassian, force her to work at the library, etc. Surely there are better ways to stage an intervention. I know they did it out of love, but Tamlin did what he did out of love, too-Speaking of, everyone hates Tamlin because he gave Nesta and Elain to the King of Hybern (which he did to save Feyre), but when Rhys threatens to kill Nesta if she hurts Feyre, that‚Äôs somehow okay.Nesta literally had to flee for her life after telling Feyre the truth about her pregnancy-Rhys and Feyre are supposedly equals, but he refuses to tell Feyre about the dangers of her pregnancy. Nesta is portrayed as the bad guy for telling her sister the truth-Can we stop worshiping Rhys now? Please?-I like that Nesta asks Cassian how he likes his blowjob. It normalizes communication during sex-SJM is too lazy to think of actual names for magical places and items. Under The Mountain sounds ominous if you think about it, but then there‚Äôs the Harp, the Mask, and the Crown-Ireally liked Nesta\'s character arc: her struggle with trauma and depression, her cold rage at her father for refusing to provide for them and the steel pride that prevents her for apologizing to Feyre for her past behavior, the self-loathing and insecurity, the female solidarity with other victims of sexual assault and misogyny. On that last note, I\'ve never understood why Nesta and Elain were so upset with being being transformed into beautiful, powerful High Fae back during ACOWAR. SJM explains it more by linking the violent act of being forced inside the Cauldron and changed against her will with rape/sexual assault.-While I adore the themes mentioned above, SJM writes the same arc over and over. All of her female protagonists (Aelin, Feyre, that girl from House of Earth and Blood) wrestle with crippling depression at some point. She recycles plots and characters and writing phrases. Gets pretty old-The ending is thematically confusing.Nesta and her friends are thrown into the Illyrian Rite of Passage thing, which has traditionally forbidden female warriors because sexism. They get through it together without magic, symbolically smashing the patriarchy. This ties in with all the themes ACOSF has been pushing.Feyre\'s childbirth near the end is where it gets confusing. Both Feyre and her kid die, but Nesta saves them by stopping time and bargaining with Death (or the Cauldron, can\'t remember). She alters the shape of Feyre\'s pelvis so a kid with wings can pass through and transforms hers as well for her far-off future kid with Cassian. In exchange, Nesta gives up some of the power she took from the Cauldron, but gets to keep a little because God forbid a SJM character is anything less than overpowered.Thematically, the childbirth scene doesn\'t make sense in terms of the book\'s overall plot. What is the implication? That women have to sacrifice power in order to have kids? That doesn\'t fit the whole feminist angle.Maybe the scene can be interpreted as Nesta finally repairing her bond with Feyre? ASOSF has seen Nesta feeling disconnected from her family (guilt over her dead father, anger towards Elaine for supposedly turning her back on her, both rage and guilt regarding Feyre). Here, Nesta is restoring family by saving her sister and nephew\'s lives. She communes with the Mother, the harbringer of life. It contrasts her power of death, which is connected to her feelings of rage and desolation. Nesta believes she is too prickly to love, but through her hand (and better mental health), life blooms.That\'s a better interpretation than SJM had a baby in real life and wanted to work in motherhood somewhere. Also, Feyre has been resurrected twice now.

Rhys and Feyre are annoying to me because they are perfect and have no flaws and that's boring. I literally could not care less about any of the other characters besides Nesta, Cassian, and Azriel. SJM also uses repetitive language, and I swear she gets paid per ellipsis. There are many things I don't like about these books.But dang it, are they entertaining! And I would be lying if I didn't say that I shipped Cassian and Nesta like I never have anyone before!I was so ready for this ship to sail. And now that it has, I gotta say, I'm disappointed. I wantedmore. I can't even tell you what I wanted more of. I just wanted more of it. I think I hyped this up in my mind so much that there was no way it could ever live up to it. I wasn't consumed by the romance the way I wanted to be.I wanted an epic love story and I didn't get one.The whole romance felt 'meh' to me, which sucks since it's the main reason I read this book. I wanted the angst, the longing, the pining, the yearning! You romance readers know what I'm talking about. Instead, I got a lot of sex scenes. And while I don't mind it, I wanted more romance than sex. It didn't live up to my expectations.I also liked but didn't love the characters. I used to love Nesta, and while I liked her growth and seeing her overcome her trauma, she didn'tfeellike the Nesta I liked so much in ACOWAR. Maybe it's just my disappointment, but she and Cassian felt off to me. Just slightly out of character when compared to what I'd seen before. Then again, people are different from different perspectives.Having seen it all before from Feyre's POV means that we got a biased, not necessarily accurate representation of who they are.That brings me to the fact that I actually liked the Inner Circle more in this book than before. I still don't love them and think they're all lowkey horrible in their own way, but I was more ok with them. Maybe because unlike Feyre, who saw them as perfect people who could do no wrong, Nesta isn't afraid to point out their flaws. Unfortunately, Cassian is blind to the fact that Rhys has flaws at all. It bothered me so much how angry and borderline violent he'd become whenever Nesta mentioned she didn't like Rhys. I also hated how Cassian was so unbothered when Rhys threatened to kill his mate. I kept waiting for Cass to stand up for Nesta in front of Rhys. It didn't happen. I don't know why everyone in this series insists on acting like Rhys is the greatest thing since sliced bread.All of that said,I did enjoy watching Nesta come into her own, and find happiness with her new friends.\xa0I also loved Nesta's relationship with the House.\xa0The House and Nesta is a friendship I didn't know I needed. By far the best relationship in the book.!!!THE FOLLOWING IS A SPOILER!!!I hate that Nesta had to lose her power. She was death incarnate and could wield insanely powerful objects as no one else could. Then it was taken away. It's like SJM didn't want her to be a match to the ever-perfect and powerful Rhys. Same with Amren in ACOWAR. Why can't powerful women stay powerful? Also, while I'm all for girl power, Nesta and her friends shouldn't have won the Blood Rite. How do girls who have been training for three months win against warriors that have been training for years? It makes no sense.!!!SPOILER OVER!!!Also, this had a weak plot.All of the books in this series do if I'm honest. It's definitely a character-focused novel. The plot feels distant from the story. It's worse because the plot of this is very obviously a setup to other novels. The villain in this story was irrelevant, they didn't even make an appearance until the end.It feels like the introductory book in a series,which I suppose it is, but I still didn't like it. This made the book feel longer than it was, and it was already pretty gosh darn long (not that it stopped me from reading it in one go).Overall, this book was OK. Nothing more. Nothing less. I am still eagerly awaiting Azriel's book.Also!! Apparently, Feyre doesn't suck at painting! Shocking right! This is the first time that her paintings were described in detail and people actually commented on their beauty rather than just vaguely acknowledging them. In my mind she still sucks though.Ok, now I'm about to get controversial. Don't come for me, I don't have the energy for it.Apparently, all the SJM haters have been bullying people for buying this book because it's not diverse enough? WTF.If you don't want to read this book, don't. If you don't want to buy this book, don't. If you're mad because the author is writing the story she wants with the characters she wants, go read other books. It's truly that simple.Don't bully people for spending their money how they want and for reading what they want.\xa0As far as I know, Sarah J. Maas hasn't disrespected anyone in her books. Sure, her books are hella white. But if it bothers you, go read more diverse books. Don't be an asshole to people who want to read this. And don't be a hypocrite and tell people that you don't support the story but then say you're gonna pirate it because you're still interested in reading it.Read it or don't.

Armed herself with invisible teeth and claws, and learned to strike faster, deeper, more lethally. Had relished it. But when the time came to put away the wolf, she\'d found it had devoured her, too.""Just out of respect for this book, I feel like I should be going through a mourning phase, sit with this story a little while longer and let it simmer, rather than trying to move on. I can\'t even begin to tell you how much of a therapeutic reading experience this was.It had all the SJM trademarks, great friendships, great emphasis on found families, great character development, and even greater sex. Of course.I\'d call this Part 2 toA Court of Mist and Fury. It echoes that book very much in terms of the themes discussed, i.e. depression and going through the process of healing from trauma, which she very much highlights is never linear.With Nesta that depression took on a different, more aggressive form:‚Ä¢\tNesta is a stone-cold bitch. I relate.‚Ä¢\tHer anger was fierce. I relate.‚Ä¢\tShe pushed people away with her attitude. On purpose. I relate.‚Ä¢\tLack of self-worth. I relate.‚Ä¢\tExtreme discomfort to emotions so anger is the easiest option. I relate.Do we see a pattern developing here?‚ÄùDid she count‚Äìwas she worth being counted? It was the question that sent everything crumpling inside her.‚ÄùShe had every right to be one (anyone that has carried this much anger and depression on their shoulders knows how much this weighs you down and debilitates you), though I initially hated how her anger would attack anyone that remotely showed any care. But your circumstances shape you. Trauma leaves an imprint. Hurt people hurt people. She was trapped in a vicious cycle of self-loathing and hatred and grief and it took a tremendous toll on her mental well-being. All due to her dysfunctional childhood, her body being invaded without permission and being thrust into a world she was conditioned to hate.I could write essays on Nesta‚Äôs character. I adore what Sarah J Maas did with this. There was so much attention to detail when it came to Nesta‚Äôs overall well-being, all which attributed to her growth and healing and it blew me away. It became about the little things, celebrating the small growths, embracing setbacks and moving forward in your own way and your own time.This is very much a character driven book, which is probably why I loved it so much. I‚Äôll take that over plot any day, especially when it‚Äôs done well. However, there is a plot present. The world-building become even more epic in this book. It was so much more solid, since it was built upon from the other books in the series. I mean, that House? I want one!I didn‚Äôt want this book to end ‚Äì it could‚Äôve been longer. This almost felt like an extensive prologue. We just got to see the cusp of her capabilities asNestaand I‚Äôm craving more of her.

But to adequately rant (like, truly rant) about all the ways this book didn\'t work for me we just need to air it all out without an vague mentions of what went down in this book.My biggest problem with this book started and ended with Rhys and Feyre. Y\'all, I truly doNOTcare about them anymore. They had their time to shine and they did...so can we please move on? The second I read about Rhys having his shield up around Feyre so no one could detect her scent I was 1000% sure she was pregnant and pissed the fuck off because I knew somehow this was going to circle all the way back around them. And sure enough Rhys went off to be an absolute piece of garbage and not tell Feyre that she would die delivering their child since it had wings. So, when NestaFINALLYhas her big moment to show how much she\'s grown as a character it\'s overshadowed by Feyre going into labor and almost dying. Which pissed me off in itself, however, I made it 730 pages and nearly put this book down because of how triggering it was. A warning would have been nice instead of having to read about a lifeless child being born because some of us have actually been dealt that shitty card in life and would rather not have to relive those moments. I was truly ready to vomit and ended up having to skim those pages.Next up, and almost just as disappointing was the romance between Nesta and Cassian. I have loved them since day one and was so looking forward to watch their love story unravel. On one hand, I loved the physical aspect of it. SJM upped her smut game for sure in this one but that\'s pretty much where it ended. There was something major missing between the two of them that left me feeling next to nothing for them and all the tension between the two of them in the prior books was so far out the window. Truly a letdown and please don\'t even get me started on how abysmally underwhelming the ""mate"" reveal was.Third, was Nesta\'s growth. Just like I loved Nesta and Cassian together, I loved Nesta by herself. She\'s always been one of my favorite characters in this series even when she was a shitty person. So, I was always looking forward to the day when we would get Nesta\'s story because she needed a major glow up growth wise and usually SJM is really great at writing good, solid growth in her characters. But again, this fell so short that majority of it just seemed physical instead of mental. While I\'m aware she has a lot of growing to do and this book was essentially her realizing that it leads me to wonder...did we really need 750 pages just to get to that point? I think not.The only, and when I say only I really mean it, thing I thoroughly enjoyed in this story was the ""Valkyrie"" training and the friendship that Nesta, Emerie, and Gywn had. I was flying through the part were the girls were thrown into the Blood Rite and cheering them on to make it all the way to the top of Ramiel. But that\'s basically it...and to get that little enjoyment in 750 pages is just a total fail for me.Of course, even though this book totally didn\'t cut it for me and left me beyond furious (Rhys & Feyre, I\'m looking at you) I\'m still a clown and will buy the next book when it comes out because I need to see what in the hell SJM is doing with these characters.

It gave me an adrenaline rush I don't think even confronting a Polar Bear would've given me.This book was definitely flawed and I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the plot (if there was one). Nesta and Cassian‚Äôs relationship however was like a weightless joy. Every conversation, every emotion had so much depth and every character grew in their own roundabout way.This book highlights the ramifications of the War with Hybern- Nesta's trauma and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. After losing her mother at a very young age, having to watch her father's neck being snapped right after he told her how much he loved her, being turned into a High Fae against her will, and the pain of almost losing her sister Elaine, broke something in her. Everybody has their own way of dealing with trauma. Nesta deals with it by building an invisible wall around herself and pushing away the people that love her the most by hurting them with her acid words.As she embarks on a journey towards self-development, she finds that the only one who can decimate the wall around her isCassian- A fierce Illyrian warrior and the General Commander of the Night Court.As her wall keeps degenerating over time, a deliciously romantic and sex-drenched relationship develops between them. There's obviously LOTS of steamy, ragingly passionate scenes but what is most appealing in their relationship is the minor displays of affection and the respect they have for each other and will set your soul on fire.They each challenge the status quo and reveal themselves to be stronger than anyone imagined through rigorous training and practice.I love howSarah J Maasredeemed Nesta's character in tiny steps and not like how she redeemed Rhysand in ACoMaF. Nesta's journey toward self-love wasn't smooth. She kept falling down, picking herself back up only to realize she fell deeper. This falling-down-climbing-back-up-thing went on for a while and it was so raw and real that my tear glands vowed to empty every drop from my body.For all those who hate Nesta after reading ACoFaS, let me tell you: I come from the same place. But do not let that stop you from reading this book because what's the worse that can happen, hmm? You will either hate it in which case you can always DNF it or get back to it later.

I also included links to the bonus scenes at the bottom.SPOILERS BELOWSo I‚Äôm just gonna go ahead and say SJM fed us so good after almost three years! So many theories were proven and the filler chapters were giving me life. It‚Äôs perfect for those who‚Äôve followed her series as they come out and have had to endure the torturous wait for more.But first thing‚Äôs first:what thehellhappened to the conflict that was building up in ACOFAS?I can‚Äôt have been the only one bamboozled with the way Sarah conveniently just resolved The One Big Thing that could have been the center of ACOSF. You should‚Äôve seen my face when Cassian mentioned that Kallon DIED IN THE PREVIOUS RITE without a fuss. Like? What? Isn‚Äôt‚Ä¶that‚Ä¶ why‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre here‚Ä¶. ? No? Okay?And alsowhat happened to the ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre coming with me to the Illyrian Mountains‚Äù bit?Again, another misdirection (for lack of a better word) on what we were expecting ACOSF to be. Soooo many people, me included, were expecting Nesta to move in with Cassian in a small cottage to actually live in the Windhaven Camp! I‚Äôm actually pretty sad that that didn‚Äôt come to pass BUT I‚Äôm not complaining with how things turned out.WITH THAT SAID;1. Put simply, the wait was worth it.I loved this book.I loved the plot.I loved NessianI loved the smut!!!!!!I loved the House of Wind.I loved Eris.I loved MOR (I know I‚Äôm surprised at how that turned out too).I loved Azriel-the-chaperone!‚ÄúYou two need a chaperone up here?‚ÄùYes. No. Yes. ‚ÄúI thought you were the chaperone.‚ÄùAz threw him a wicked smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not entirely sure I‚Äôm enough.‚ÄùThe full quote is even better than I could have hoped for!2. Another thing I love about ACOSF was the passage of time!The entire book spans about a little over a year, which justifies the crazy amount of events that happen in this behemoth of a book.Remember when the entire TOG series was said to have happened in onlyone year? Yeah I didn‚Äôt like that.3. I have a feeling that the red star that shot through the sky was Aelin falling through Prythian in KOA!PLEASE TELL ME YOU GUYS SAW IT TOO.‚ÄúThe mood hadn‚Äôt been helped by a rare red star blasting across the sky one day‚Äîan ill omen, Nesta had heard the priestesses muttering. Cassian reported that even Rhys had been rattled by it, seeming unusually contemplative afterward. But Nesta suspected that the omen wasn‚Äôt the only thing contributing to Rhys‚Äôs solemnity. Feyre was only two months from giving birth, and they still knew nothing about how to save her.‚Äù4. I‚Äôm just gonna take a minute here to talk about the smut.So ACOSF is officially an adult book and it shows in the smut! There is so much of it and I have only one complaint - that SJM did not flesh out a particular 34+35 scene. She no longer uses her oh-so-famous ‚Äúvelvet wrapped steel‚Äù innuendos. We go straight to the point with ‚Äúcock‚Äù and even the word ‚Äúcunt‚Äù now.It also goes without saying that the smut is decidedly more intense than what we've seen from her previous books. SJM was not kidding at all when she said she's descended into new levels of filthy when writing ACOSF.I did, however, still have some slight issues with the bookFor one, I didnotlove how Feysand hijacked certain parts of this book *cough cough the ending cough cough* It‚Äôs a Nessian book and yet Feysand is still the center of their world. No, I‚Äôm living in Nesta‚Äôs world. I want it to be all about her!I also had a slight disconnect with Nesta‚Äôs character although I can‚Äôt tell if she was acting out of character or if she was just grossly misrepresented in books 1-3 since we read it from Feyre‚Äôs POV. Nevertheless, I still love how she arced as a character and how she healed.START MAJOR SPOILERS SECTIONEnding spoilerI‚Äôm very sad that Nesta pulled an Aelin and lost majority of her powers in the end. I loved powerful!Nesta. I loved that everyone was afraid of her. I loved that she was rewriting Prythian history by merely existing. Gods that are older than Prythian itself were afraid of her. I hate how she gave that up in the end. What is it with women being rendered powerless in these books (Aelin and Amren)?Nesta spoilerI am also upset that Nesta ended up melding back with the IC? Everyone was expecting her to move out to Illyria and have her own family outside of the Night Court - I wanted that for her too. But, oh well.Azriel POV spoiler (Bonus scenehttps://drive.google.com/drive/folder...)I‚Äôm SO excited to see where his story goes. I‚Äôm not a heavy shipper for Elriel or Moriel or Azgwyn (??) but I‚Äôm interested to see who gets to be with Azriel in the end!Feysand POV spoiler (Bonus scenehttps://www.reddit.com/r/acotar/comme...ORhttps://wetransfer.com/downloads/abec...)THAT TEASER OF RHYSAND‚ÄôS LAST NAME??? GIVE IT TO US SARAH WE ARE SO CLOSE.Generic spoiler‚Ä¶..And is anyone else scared that not even one minor character died‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs kinda sus‚Ä¶.END MAJOR SPOILERS SECTIONAll in all, I would give this 4.8 stars because it was just so good, save for the extremely high expectations which were kinda curbed with her sudden plot change.The Azriel bonus scene was also super interesting and I‚Äôm excited to see what book 5 has in store for us!So I'm gonna go and digest this for a few days before rereading it all over againbecause I am a slut for Nessian.‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîPRE ACOSF RELEASE PREDICTIONS BELOWBecause Feb 2021 is coming nearer, I'm going to post my expectations for ACOSF because I'm a simp for Nessian.These will be a mix of stories from ACOTAR 1-3 I want told from their POVs as well as their own character arcs!FOR CASSIAN> More about his upbringing and his mother> Him wrecking oneBUILDINGin the Summer Court that resulted in him being banned lol> His first encounter with Bryaxis> Cassian taking Mor‚Äôs v*rginity> What the hell was in that box he threw into the Sidra üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠> Training the female Illyrians and Nesta> Seeing him more as a General Commander and not the class clown/comic relief in the IC that we saw him from Feyre‚Äôs POV.

I think my biggest takeaway is‚Ä¶ i didn‚Äôt love rhysand (this feels wild to even type). i feel like he was truly book boyfriend status back in the day, but now? i feel like he made me upset way more than he ever made me swoon during this reread. And this book really solidified that, and i think it was extra amplified because cassian is such a good boy. but again, this was such a fun reread that i really enjoyed doing, and we will see if i can rereadthrone of glassvery soon!trigger + content warnings(with minor spoilers for this story!):ptsd, grief, loss of loved ones in past (parents, siblings), blood, domestic abuse in past, child abuse in past, sexual assault in past, talk of rape in past, murder, death, talk of war, sexism, misogyny, nightmares, talk of captivity in past, drowning, attempted assault and rape, talk of suicide ideation, withholding very important medical information, high-risk pregnancy, ableist and dated language for people with disabilities, emergency child birth scene (involving death of both mother and baby‚Ä¶ this world has the power of magic so things end up okay, but i think this could be very triggering to some readers, so please use caution.)[2021 first read]‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖlisten, i can't believe we are here either. but this just truly impacted me (and made me cry) so much. i will say I feel a little biased because nesta and cassian are two of my favorite characters from this entire series but... i still didn't expect this to be so beautiful. and nesta finding these friendships and seeing them heal together, see their worth together, love unconditionally and unapologetically together? regardless of how hard and scary the journey to those steps were to even get to? seeing nesta realize she's not a bad person, no matter what the world makes her mental health believe? i really loved it.blog|instagram|youtube|kofi|spotify|amazon""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'This book made a lot of choices. Most of them were bad.A Court of Silver Flamesfeels like poorly written ACOTAR fanfiction. It has all the tags and features: making you hate the canon main characters, an uncomfortable pregnancy, the incorporation of lore you didn‚Äôt ask for and don‚Äôt need, ridiculously toxic love interests, and an unnecessary 200,000 word count.Let‚Äôs talk about the High Lord of the Night Court, a character who was a villain, then an adored main character, and now a villain again. Rhysand is so violent and overprotective and his only personality trait is ‚ÄúI will shred you to bits if you touch or breathe on or think about Feyre.‚Äù He literally put a shield around her so even her friends couldn‚Äôt be around her. Rhysand is only respectful to women who are submissive to him and obey his authority. He was nice to Nesta only after she made a huge sacrifice at the end for his sake. He‚Äôs so bitter, and I don‚Äôt know why Feyre finds that attractive. I liked him before because he wasn‚Äôt overprotective. He let Feyre do what she wanted. But now‚Ä¶‚ÄúCassian knew [Rhysand would] shred anyone who so much as blinked wrong at Feyre into a million bloody ribbons.‚Äùlol.Feyre is just a decoration in this book. Although she does have power, we don‚Äôt see her use it like she did in the previous books. What happened to that important and empowering fight to make her High Lady? Now she has no agency.I‚Äôm especially angry because this is so out of character for the Inner Circle. Mor‚Äôs development horrified me in particular. She was abused badly in the Court of Nightmares, so she knows how terrible and sick they are. Azriel even describes the way she ‚Äúsavored every moment in the sun‚Ä¶ as if the first seventeen years of her life, spent in the darkness of the Hewn City, still lurked around her.‚Äù But then Mor says this:Mor sipped her tea, the portrait of elegant innocence. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd be better off throwing Nesta into the Court of Nightmares. She‚Äôd thrive there.‚ÄùWhat happened to the Inner Circle who accepted Feyre with open arms and helped her heal from her sorrow and trauma? Is Feyre‚Äôs grief more palatable to the Inner Circle than Nesta‚Äôs? The sisters process their hurt in different ways, but Rhysand acts like Nesta is an embarrassment to the family because of it, like they would be the perfect family if it weren‚Äôt for her. In contrast, Feyre gets all the support she needs. There are ways to build up new protagonists without turning the ones we already love into villains.I haven‚Äôt even talked about the worst part of the book yet: Feyre‚Äôs situation. (I think this was revealed pretty early in the book, so it isn‚Äôt a spoiler. But you can fast forward to the next paragraph if you don‚Äôt want to know.) Feyre is in the middle of a life-threatening pregnancy with a baby that could literally rip her apart. Guess who decides by committee that it would be better not to tell her this vital information about her pregnancy, her health, her life, and the baby inside her body. That‚Äôs right: Rhysand and the Inner Circle. A really important theme of ACOTAR is individual, personal freedom. But this threw that all away. I cannot describe how infuriated this made me. And when Nesta made the decision to tell Feyre that childbirth would kill her (a decision made out of spite, but still a good one for Feyre), the response from the other characters was bizarre. From what I remember, Feyre was upset but ultimately supported the Inner Circle‚Äôs decision to hide this from her, and Nesta was forcibly and emphatically rejected by her family. I can‚Äôt make this stuff up.Parts ofA Court of Silver Flameswere good, although they were few and far between. The Blood Rite was pretty cool. The tension and high stakes and character development and the way the Valkyries bonded in their struggle was amazing. I really liked Emerie and Gwyn, and I‚Äôm invested in their backgrounds and their journeys to come. They are refreshingly unproblematic and normal. They are easy characters to love.Besides the ending, the plot wasn‚Äôt very good. The search for the Crown/Harp/Mask felt arbitrary and too random for my taste. It also got sidetracked constantly, so it wasn‚Äôt satisfying to me. However, this gripe seems so minor compared to the rest of the dumpster fire that isA Court of Silver Flamesthat I don‚Äôt even care.‚ÄúMy mate‚Äù every other pageHas filled me with unending rageBreaking Dawn-esque pregnancyFeels like a fanfic fever dreamAzriel, he shadow-singsCas doesn‚Äôt have the longest wingsFeyre does interior designNesta walks a narrow lineGwyn and Emerie are true heroesCassian‚Äôs over five zero zeroSister‚Äôs sick?

I got so much to say, so jumping right in.Why I rated it 1 star when I read it the first time-1. I read the whole series in one go instead of pacing myself or giving a break in between the ACOTAR world. Reading it immediately after ACOWAR and ACOFAS backfired. It led me to bebored.2. I thought it wastoo smutty.Which it still is fyi but this did not concern me in my reread oddly.3. I hadnot liked Nesta.Jumping straight from Feyre's journey was not an ideal decision. Feyre had a trilogy, so spending a lot of time with her compared to just one book of Nesta's did make an impact. I was still angry with Nesta and her treatment of Feyre.4. I simplyforgot about the majority of eventsthat were correlated to the Crescent City series when I made my GR account and rated it.Why I give it 5 stars now-1. Ipaced myself.Gave myself some time in between ACOWAR, AOCFAS and ACOSF. This worked brilliantly for me. There was proper balance.2. Idid not expect muchas I was concerned about how this reread will go. With my expectations low, the reread ended surprising me.3.I ADORED Nestathis time around. I found her journey admirable, relatable and far more understandable. Her struggles were portrayed in such a raw manner and the way she overcame them bit by bit was chef's kiss. I too, like the other characters had not given her a fair chance but when I did the way she blossomed into a wonderful character was worth rereading!! Nesta is such a badass and although I am not saying she was not wrong before (she was) but I understand now.I see Nesta Archeron, her being, and she is worthy.4.Romance and banterwas so fun. Cassian is such a softie and marshmallow at heart. I swear I just wanna give him a big bear hug.5. I loved reading about thepossibilities of different worlds connecting.There's so much that can happen.6. Theendingwas so emotional. I swear I was sobbing.Some things that might be controversial but I wanna state my take on it-1. I see people call Rhysand an arrogant asshole a lot in reference to his persona in this book.I disagree.Sure, he was harsh a bit but never arrogant, never an asshole. Rhys was always honest, never lying to anyone or Nesta. He has his mate to look after, his court to look after. People think that just cause he is Feyre's mate that's all there is to him. Wrong! Rhys is also High Lord. Trained to be a leader and warrior, he talks and acts like one. He doesn't have to act soft towards others he doesn't know well. And Nesta was that one person, he did not know.Just cause someone criticizes you, does not mean they are your enemy.The amount of hate Rhys gets is just uncalled for imo.2. This might not be so controversial butNesta's powers???The thing that happened at the end should not have happened. That's all I'll say to keep it spoiler free lol.Without elaborating much on my private life, I just wanna say- I felt Nesta's journey deeply and it resonated with me. There have been some changes in my own life since the last time I read this book and all I say to Nesta is, I get it.Man, I just had a completely new experience reading this lmao. Am sitting here as I draft my review, thinking wtf did I read the first timeüòÇüôà~‚Ä¢~‚Ä¢~It's time to give Nesta another chance.

How strongly and personally it touched me.This is not an easy book to read and understand.I guess that part of its rawness and bittersweet tones are to blame on the fact that it's told from Nesta's pov, a character who was firstly written to be hated and who probably hates herself more than the audience ever could and eventually did.She's a very intense fictional person, and I'd lie if I said she didn't frustrate me to no end in more than one occasion.But I guess that's exactly what SJM wanted from this character.I could literally feel the self-hatred exude from the pages. The self-sabotaging, the way Nesta, who's never been a saint but who maybe was programmed to feel like she was one, denies herself everything that makes her feel even remotely worthy of light.I know how that feels, and I wanted to see what she would do to use her pain, her trauma and her past to mold herself into a new, damaged yet not spoilt, perpetually-evolving creature.I wasn't disappointed.I actually got more than I expected, because I eventually ended up falling in love with all the nuances this character possesses.Not one of them had offered to help save the Archeron family from poverty.They had thrown them all, mere children and a crumbling man, to the wolves.So Nesta had become a wolf. Armed herself with invisible teeth and claws, and learned to strike faster, deeper, more lethally. Had relished it. But when the time came to put away the wolf, she‚Äôd found it had devoured her, too.I must admit I never really was a fan of Nesta, but I didn't really ever hate her, either. I was simply indifferent to her and her antics, especially considering I knew being ACOTAR a Beauty and the Beast retelling, at least one of the sisters must be an asshole, and that's Nesta for you.I started getting interested in her as a character at the start of ACOWAR and, confession time, I mainly did it because of a pretty awesome Nessian fanart I've seen on instagram.Oh, don't judge me.The point is, as weak as I am for a good and steamy romance, it takes more than fantart and a few stolen glances to make me appreciate a difficult character, and if SJM managed to steal my heart with her Nesta, in the end, it means she did a great job that goes way beyond ships and smut.For the majority of the previous novels, Nesta is an unlikeable character, and for obvious reasons, the author doesn't want you to like her, so that it feels even more genuine when you start seeing there's good in her, and that she's perfectly nuanced, just like a real person.‚ÄúThere can be nothing more than sex, Cassian.‚ÄùHis jaw tightened, and he seemed to struggle with some internal battle before he said darkly, ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll take whatever you offer me.‚Äù He leaned in, his body still not touching hers, and said against her ear, ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôll take you however you wish me to.‚ÄùHer toes curled on the stones, her hair dripping. ‚ÄúAnd if I wish to take you?‚ÄùHe smiled against her ear. ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll beg you to ride me into oblivion.‚ÄùI want to discuss her character's journey in this review, because the book itself was good and the plot -the amount that was there, at least- was okay, but A Court of Silver Flames is a charcater-driven novel where the protagonist wasn't always a good person.For example, I've read at least a dozen reviews complaining about how this book makes you love Nesta and hate the rest of the original characters, or the opposite, and I can't say I don't see wher they come from, but I was lucky enough to fall in neither of these two categories since I've ended up loving Nesta and loving the other characters, as well, at the same time.They didn't always treat her with kindness, but I feel like they treated her in a very realistic way.When someone keeps pushing their luck, it's only a matter of time before people lose their patience.I loved how they each had a chance to connect and tangle their story with Nesta's, getting to know her, getting loved and understood by her, all of them finally getting a second chance at redemption and healing.One of the scenes I loved the most, is in fact, towards the end when Rhys kneels in front of Nesta after she's saved both Feyre and her baby's life. I lost it completely when they hugged.Nesta isn't an easy person to get along with. She's got a past that pretty much justifies her actions, but the way she choses to handle the consequences is all her own. And that's the point I feel like we need to remember. All her flaws are on display right from the start and there are moments when it even gets worse, but it's all part of her journey.It's only when you reach rock bottom that you can do anything but go up, right?‚ÄúYou could have ruled the world with your power,‚Äù he said carefully.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to rule the world.‚Äù Her eyes were unguarded in a way he had never seen. Mate, she had called him.‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù Cassian managed to ask, voice rasping.She smiled, and damn if it wasn‚Äôt the loveliest thing he‚Äôd ever seen. ‚ÄúYou.‚Äù‚ÄúYou‚Äôve had me from the moment you met me.‚ÄùShe tucked a strand of hair behind an arched ear. ‚ÄúI know.‚ÄùI loved how Nesta's relationship with Elain and Feyre was addressed. Elain could never do anything wrong in Nesta's eyes and the moment she (presumably) turned her back on her, Nesta was forcefully faced with a truth she wasn't ready to see, or better, that she didn't want to see.Same thing with Feyre. I felt like the sybolism of Feyre hanging paintings of everyone but Nesta in the new, opulent house she and her husband created, was for Nesta worse than any offense the inner circle ever thrown her way (and not without merit).One of the things Nesta resented most about about Feyre, in fact, is the fact that Nesta needed her to survive but Feyre didn't need her in return. Feyre was nothing but kind to her, all the time, but she hit her in the most subtle of ways, in a way that is more important to Feyre than words.Mind it, I don't mean what Nesta did and how she acted in the past is condonable, I'm just saying there's a reason behind her actions, reasons that will definitely help you (I don't say like, because you're allowed to still not like a character even if their past is justified) understand her a bit more.Nesta, as I see her, didn't like the hate and anger she felt all the time, especially towards her little sister. She, in fact, hated it and hated herself for feeling it.I've seen reviewers claim Nesta's friendship with Gwyn and Emerie made no sense, since she already had two sisters she could connect and make up with; I see their point, but I feel like Nesta was re-discovering herself and creating bonds tentatively presenting herself as the new person she was trying to become.Her relationship with the House, for example, was my absolute favorite. In my opinion, the fact that the House was stubborn, sweet, sarcastic in its own special way, warm and curious, added to the knowledge that Nesta Made it, makes me wonder (and hope) if that's exactly how Nesta sees her true self, if that's what she'd like others to see her.Rhys lifted his head. ‚ÄúThis is a bad idea.‚ÄùCassian winked. ‚ÄúThat should be written on the Night Court crest.‚ÄùI loved seeing her through the eyes of someone who didn't fully know the darkest sides of her trauma and grief; I feel like it gave Nesta a glimps of what her life with her sisters could have been had her mother not gaslighted her into needing to be perfect at all costs, filling her head with conjectures and prejudices and depriving her from being free to decide what to do with her personality and future.And that's where Cassian finally jumps in. God bless that guy, honestly.I absolutely LOVED how he wasn't afraid to call her out on her bullshit but still knew (my god, he justknew) she needed some love despite it all, simple as that, and without asking anything in return.And sure, both Feyre and Elain loved Nesta, but I feel like the relationship the three sisters always had was always taunted by what they had to endure for and with one another.Feyre and Rhys will always own my heart, but Cassian and Nesta gave me the best emotions and I will never forget how beautiful they are together.And, holy shitNesta at the end, deciding she one day will want to have a baby with her Cassian completely destroyed me in the sweetest of ways. I don't consider motherhood as something essential, something you need to experience because it's mandatory to feel like a real woman. If a person feels complete and accomplished without ever having kids, I totally support it, but as a mother who has a problematic mother, I think it's one more proof of the fact that Nesta's journey is heading to a genuinely happy path.‚ÄúI‚Äôll be with you every step of the way,‚Äù he whispered into her palm. ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt lock me out. You want to walk in silence for a week, I‚Äôm fine with that. So long as you talk to me at the end of it.‚ÄùPlotwise speaking, there wasn't much going on, but I enjoyed it, nonetheless.One of the chapters I liked the most is when Nesta, Cassian and Azriel (instert Brooklyn99 BoyleMy fantasy threesome!gif) went to the Bog of Oorid looking for the Mask.I was fucking terrified by the whole Kelpie encounter.And the gift sharing moment was e v e r y t h i n g.I love Az with all my heart sigh.Also, I adored basically every scene with Gwyn and Emerie, especially when they were together.Maas's writing is exquisite as usual. I'll never stop being amazed by how vividly I can picture in my mind the scenes she describes.The only plotline I wish was handled a little better was the Rhys/Feyre andyou know whatone. Every choice Rhys made fromthatpoint, felt a bit uncharacteristical and not well thought enough.I decided to blame it on the emotion, because I refuse to think our Rhys would be anything but pragmatic when it comes to his Feyre's safety.Sorry if all of this makes little sense. This book and this character in particular made me really emotional in a way I'd never thought I'd feel toward a fantasy book carachter.Oh, and to lighten up the mood after this sob fest...this book also taught me something I've suspected for a while now, and that is, that everyone in acotar wants a piece of Azriel. Who am I to disagree.Nesta could hardly remember words. But she found them when she whispered into the darkness, ‚ÄúStay with me.‚ÄùA shudder rocked through him, but he only smiled as he tucked her into his side.And warm and safe and home at last in Cassian‚Äôs arms, Nesta slept.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '‚ÄùYour power is a song, and one I‚Äôve waited a very, very long time to hear, Nesta‚Äù.Aviso: la primera parte de esta rese√±a va a estar libre despoilersy les dir√© cuando empiecen a aparecer para que puedan dejar de leerla si no quieren saber qu√© pasa.No s√© por qu√© me sigo sorprendiendo de que Sarah J. Maas lo logre una y otra vez. Es absolutamente impresionante lo que esta mujer puede llegar a transmitir con sus palabras. De verdad, leyendo ACOSF sent√≠ que me destrozaban hasta lo m√°s hondo y que luego, poco a poco, me iban reconstruyendo y poniendo cada pieza en su lugar.Como muchos aqu√≠, debo confesar que no estaba tan emocionada por este libro porque se centrar√≠a en Nesta. Pero, as√≠ mismo, tengo que admitir que me com√≠ todas y cada una de mis reservas y que, leyendo cada p√°gina, entend√≠ profundamente a Nesta, sus traumas, su sufrimiento, su personalidad, la culpa que siente todo el tiempo y la sensaci√≥n de que nunca eres lo suficientemente bueno para nadie. Y no s√≥lo la entend√≠, sino que me sent√≠ jodidamente identificada. Y, claro, luego me di cuenta de que odiaba tant√≠simo a Nesta porque reflejaba las partes m√°s horribles de m√≠ misma.ACOSF es un libro tremendamente intenso y lleno de emociones, de momentos de confrontar los sentimientos m√°s oscuros, de arrepentimientos, rabia y odio. Pero tambi√©n es una historia que lleva a Nesta en un camino que le permite enfrentar todos los demonios que tiene por dentro, todas las cosas que se ha guardado durante a√±os, las decisiones que le quitaron de las manos y su odio hacia s√≠ misma. Y, a pesar de lo oscuro que es el pozo en el que est√° y de lo duro que es el camino, Nesta se va a dar cuenta de que siempre va a existir alguien al otro lado de esa oscuridad para tenderle una mano, para caminar junto a ella y para recordarle una y otra vez que s√≠ que se merece el amor de sus amigos y de su familia. Que nunca va a estar sola.En serio, no les puedo decir con palabras lo hondo que me lleg√≥ esta historia al coraz√≥n. S√≠, es el libro m√°shotde Sarah J. Maas y todas esas escenas est√°n dise√±adas para ser le√≠das mientras est√°s en una tina llena de hielo porque‚Ä¶ joder. Y obviamente las marqu√© todas y casi me da un infarto leyendo otras. Y tambi√©n mucha envidia. Pero m√°s all√° de eso, creo que eran una forma s√∫per poderosa de comunicar lo mucho que Nesta necesitaba una distracci√≥n, salirse de sus pensamientos durante unos momentos‚Ä¶ u horas (because Fae lovers, jajaja) porque estar dentro de su cabeza era demasiado doloroso. Y la entiendo.Y Cassian‚Ä¶ ay, ¬øc√≥mo puede existir alguien tan bueno, valiente, sensible y paciente? Si amaron a Cassian en los libros anteriores, en este van a querer abrazarlo (y m√°s cosas, ejem) hasta que todo est√© bien para √©l. No se pueden imaginar todo lo que conocemos sobre Cassian en ACOSF, sobre su pasado, sus sentimientos, sus miedos y, sobre todo, c√≥mo es tan genuino como para siempre demostrar lo mucho que le importan quienes son cercanos para √©l, todo lo que estar√≠a dispuesto a hacer y soportar por ellos. En este libro, Cassian enfrenta toda la tormenta de proporciones √©picas que significa estar cerca de Nesta, pero lo hace porque sabe que ella est√° en un lugar oscuro, que est√° luchando por salir de all√≠ y √©l la entiende‚Ä¶ porque ha estado √©l mismo en ese camino antes. Joder, es que, de verdad‚Ä¶ despu√©s de leer este tipo de cosas, ves a las personas del mundo real y te das cuenta de que eso no existe. Ojal√° todos pudi√©ramos tener la certeza de que, cuando salgamos de nuestros momentos m√°s oscuros, siempre va a estar alguien all√≠ esper√°ndonos para decirnos que todo va a estar bien o incluso s√≥lo para sonre√≠rnos o abrazarnos.Ahora, obviamente todo el libro no se centra √∫nicamente en Nesta y Cassian, sino que Sarah J. Maas nos presenta una nueva amenaza que puede, nuevamente, destruir todas las Cortes e incluso afectar al mundo de los humanos. Pero esta es una amenaza mucho m√°s antigua, poderosa y letal de lo que el Rey de Hybern pudo llegar a ser. M√°s adelante hablar√© de ello, pero me gust√≥ que hubiera una historia paralela de conflicto, de magia arcana y de monstruos que no pueden volver a caminar libremente por el mundo.Antes de empezar con la secci√≥n despoilers, tengo que decirles que am√© profundamente volver a ver a los personajes que adoro. Feyre, Rhysand, Mor, Amren y Azriel no son solamente sombras en el fondo de las escenas de ACOSF, sino que siguen siendo importantes y est√°n all√≠ para los momentos m√°s cr√≠ticos. Ahora, que ellos sean ligeramente menos importantes en este libro que Cassian y Nesta no quiere decir que Sarah J. Maas no los vaya a usar para rompernos el coraz√≥n, triturar los pedacitos, sumergirlos en √°cido y luego incinerarlos. De verdad, es tremendo‚Ä¶ Y lo √∫nico que dir√©, y que discutir√© m√°s a fondo m√°s adelante, es que les juro que no pude parar de llorar con el √∫ltimo 10% del libro. Y no precisamente de felicidad.Vamos con losspoilersy con Isa perdiendo la cabeza‚Ä¶ de nuevo.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢1. S√≠, vamos a hablar de la dedicatoria del libro. Cuando la le√≠ al principio dije como ‚Äúoh, vaya, bueno‚Äù, pero ahora que la estoy releyendo y estoy escribiendo esta rese√±a, puedo decirles que casi lloro. Dice‚ÄùFor every Nesta out there, climb the mountain‚Äù.2. Las pesadillas que tiene Nesta nos dan una pista de todo lo que est√° batallando por dentro desde que la sumergieron en elCauldrony, joder, poco a poco entendemos por qu√© es como es. Nadie que lidie con pesadillas que describe como el fr√≠o antes de las estrellas, el vac√≠o antes del infierno, puede siquiera fingir estar bien.3. ¬øC√≥mo me atrev√≠ a juzgar a Nesta sin saber que ella sent√≠a la inmortalidad como un fuego eterno y no como una serena juventud? Son estas peque√±as frases las que nos dan, incluso en las primeras p√°ginas, las pistas que necesitamos para ver lo destrozada que est√°, que toda su mala actitud es una coraza para protegerse.4. Me rompe el coraz√≥n ver a Cassian al principio del libro admitiendo que el fuego helado de los ojos de Nesta siempre hab√≠a sido una tentaci√≥n para √©l. Y es que justo lo piensa cuando est√° en su apartamento destartalado en donde ella se ha estadofuckinga cuantos machos Fae quisiera y bebiendo hasta perder el conocimiento‚Ä¶ Y lo peor es que Nesta tiene a un macho en su cuarto en ese momento. Agh.5. Y luego ella admite para s√≠ misma que todo ese sexo con desconocidos, el alcohol y la m√∫sica la ayuda a apagar un poco ese fuego fr√≠o y oscuro que la consume desde que la forzaron a entrar alCauldron. Nesta siempre ha estado muy rota y siento que la hemos juzgado demasiado sin saber exactamente lo mal que lo estaba pasando dentro de su cabeza.6. Lo triste es que hay una cita que dice que ese sexo no la hac√≠a sentir nada m√°s all√° de un momento fugaz de liberaci√≥n de ese poder catacl√≠smico que hay dentro de ella. Pero luego se r√≠e un poco y dice que incluso los siglos de experiencia que algunos machos Fae tienen no los hacen buenos en la cama, jajaja.7. EL HORROR del momento en el que Cassian vuelve a ese apartamento y le dice que se nota que ni siquiera se ha dignado a cambiar las s√°banas entre sus visitantes PORQUE PUEDE OLERLOS. Dioses, en serio Nesta est√° en un punto muy bajo en ese momento.8. Es tremendo cuando Feyre y los dem√°s le dan un ultim√°tum a Nesta: o accede a entrenar con Cassian por las ma√±anas y a ayudar a las ac√≥litas de la biblioteca por las tardes e intenta enderezar su vida o la van a enviar de vuelta al mundo humano. Esa pelea y esa conversaci√≥n son dur√≠simas, pero ten√≠an que darle un empuj√≥n para que empezara a salir de ese pozo.9. AMO A RHYSAND. Hay un momento en el que est√° hablando con Cassian despu√©s de la ‚Äúintervention‚Äù de Nesta. Y Cass le dice que tiene que volver a entrenar porque no querr√≠a que Feyre, sumate, encontrara partes blandas en su cuerpo. Y RHYS RESPONDE QUE ELLA NUNCA ENCUENTRA NADA BLANDO Y OMG, JAJAJA. Y luego hablan de que Rhys les dio el d√≠a libre a los sirvientes y Cassian cree que es para que no los escuchen pelear despu√©s de lo de Nesta, pero Rhys le dice que no son las peleas lo que no quiere que escuchen, AIUDA.10. Se me rompi√≥ MAL el coraz√≥n cuando Cassian vio el retrato de Feyre y Rhys juntos, sus anillos y a ellos mismos y lo invadi√≥ ese sentimiento de querer lo que ellos tienen, a alguien especial a su lado. POBRECILLO M√çO.11. Ay, dioses, y m√°s adelante Cassian dice que tiene que alejarse mucho de la casa del r√≠o porque no quiere ni o√≠rlo ni sentir su poder cuando Rhys‚Ä¶ acabe. PERO ES QUE ESO NO ES TODO. Luego menciona como quien no quiere la cosa que, cuando eran m√°s j√≥venes, Az, Rhys y Cassian se f*llaban a much√≠simas hembras Y GENERALMENTE EN LA MISMA HABITACI√ìN. ¬øES QUE NADIE VA A HABLAR DE ESTO? O sea‚Ä¶ dioses. A m√≠ nadie me puede quitar de la cabeza que esos tres‚Ä¶you know. QUIERO UNFANFICDE ESTO YA MISMO.12. AMO cada vez que Cassian molesta a Nesta record√°ndole lo mucho que le gusta leer novelas er√≥ticas, jajaja.13. Uf, tambi√©n me rompe el coraz√≥n los momentos en los que Nesta admite para s√≠ misma que sabe lo desagradable que es con los dem√°s, lo dura que es la coraza que la rodea y lo asustada que est√° ella misma de ese pozo infinito de poder oscuro que tiene dentro de ella. Y hay una cita en la que dice que siempre se sinti√≥ c√≥moda siendo como un lobo, como un depredador, pero que cuando lleg√≥ el momento de eliminar a ese ser feroz, se dio cuenta de que la hab√≠a devorado incluso a ella.14. Ehhh‚Ä¶ ¬øpodemos hablar de que Rhys sigue siendo un loquillo? Es que le habla por el v√≠nculo mental a Cassian en medio de dos‚Ä¶ eh‚Ä¶roundscon Feyre,if you know what I mean.15. A ver, todos sabemos que, tarde o temprano, Cassian y Nesta van a hacerlo sobre todas las superficies de la Casa, pero es que toda la tensi√≥n previa es la que me matabaaaaaa. ¬°La tensi√≥n y las frases con doble sentido y los gru√±idos bajos! En el primer d√≠a de entrenamiento, Cassian le dice a Nesta, con voz s√∫per grave, que le alegra que se haya levantado lista para jugar. Y ELLA SE DERRITE AUNQUE NUNCA LO ACEPTAR√Å EN VOZ ALTA‚Ä¶ todav√≠a.16. PERO LO QUE S√ç RECUERDA ES ESE MOMENTO EN LA BATALLA FINAL, ahhhh. O sea, cuando pensaron que iban a morir y √©l la bes√≥ y le dijo que desear√≠a haber tenido m√°s tiempo, pero que la encontrar√° en esta vida y las siguientes. Es que me muero. Y Nesta admite mentalmente que nunca deja de pensar en ese momento. Ayyyyyy, ya b√©senseeeee.17. Sarah J. Maas me quiere matar porque luego Nesta dice que si Cassian cree que todo esto de entrenar va a terminar con ella subi√©ndose a su cama, que est√° muy equivocado. Y √©l dice que eso est√° clar√≠simo, que √©l no se va a subir a la cama de ella, PORQUE ES ELLA QUIEN VA A SUPLICAR ESTAR EN LA CAMA DE CASSIAN. AYUDA, NECESITO AGUA FR√çA.18. Y no soy la √∫nica que necesita hielo porque cuando Cassian ve a Nesta en losIllyrian leathersde entrenar, que son pantalones y equipo muy ajustado, el pobre casi muere y empieza a fantasear sobre todo lo que har√≠a quit√°ndole esos pantalones y‚Ä¶ uf.19. Y justo despu√©s de esas fantas√≠as Cassian recuerda que no ha tenido m√°s compa√±√≠a que su mano desde hace m√°s de dos a√±os, cuando lo hizo duro y r√°pido contra una pared de ladrillo con una hembra cualquiera que encontr√≥ en un bar. O SEA, CASSIAN EST√ÅHORNYY LA QUE NOS ESPERA EN ESTE LIBRO‚Ä¶ MADRE DE TODOS LOS DIOSES.20. Esos primeros d√≠as de entrenamiento cuando Cassian lleva a Nesta a Windhaven y ella se niega a levantarse de una roca y entrenar son tremendos. Y es obvio que todos losillyrianse est√°n burlando de Cassian por dejar que una mujer tan terca le gane‚Ä¶ y aunque Nesta sabe que lo est√° haciendo ver d√©bil y lo odia, no puede ceder porque siente que es mejor que la odie a que se acerque. MI CORAZ√ìN.21. Parte de la raz√≥n por la que este libro me ense√±√≥ a no odiar a Nesta es que entendemos mucho m√°s c√≥mo piensa. Y me identifiqu√© un mont√≥n, de verdad. Verla a ella era verme a m√≠ en los momentos m√°s horrorosos de salud mental. Cuando ella dice que odia todo lo que es, que est√° absolutamente exhausta y que est√° cansada de querer estar en un lugar que no sea su cabeza‚Ä¶ wow.I felt that.22. Me encant√≥ la conversaci√≥n que tienen Amren y Cassian en la que ella le dice que deje que Nesta cave su propia tumba, pero que al final le ofrezca su mano. Que no se rinda y siga ofreci√©ndole su ayuda para salir de ese lugar oscuro.23. FAAAAAAAN de que Lucien diga que Tamlin est√° sufriendo y que desde el final de la guerra no ha adoptado su forma Fae, sino que est√° vagando por su corte como la bestia que es.Fucker.24. Sabes que se vienen problemas cuando empiezas a enterarte de que las criaturas poderos√≠simas que inclinaron la balanza en favor de la Corte de la Noche tienen hermanos. En este caso, nos presentan a Koschei, el hermano delBone Carver. Y que parece que est√° aliado con Briallyn, una de las reinas que entr√≥ alCauldrony que ahora quiere recuperar laDread Trove, una colecci√≥n de objetos poderos√≠simos, hechos por elCauldronmismo, que tiene el poder de empezar otra guerra y borrarlos a todos del mapa.Oh, joy.25. Hay una ma√±ana en la que Nesta casi no puede moverse porque la noche anterior intent√≥ bajar las 10.000 escaleras que separan a la Casa de Velaris. Y Cassian se da cuenta en el desayuno y la molesta con que no se puede ni parar. Y ella lo hace apoy√°ndose un mont√≥n en sus manos, pero √©l le dice que no cuenta si son las manos las que est√°n haciendo todo el trabajo. Y ELLA LE DICE QUE SON SUS MANOS LAS QUE DEBEN ESTAR OCUPADAS TODAS LAS NOCHES, OMG. Entonces Cassian le responde con voz grave que si es eso lo que le ense√±an sus libros er√≥ticos, que s√≥lo se hace por la noche. √âl nota Y HUELE lohotque se pone ella y sigue diciendo que se puede hacer en cualquier momento, con la luz del d√≠a, durante un ba√±o o incluso despu√©s de una LARGA Y DURA sesi√≥n de entrenamiento. En serio, lean este libro con hielo a la mano.26. ¬°Lo peor es que toda esa conversaci√≥n sucede mientras Az tambi√©n est√° en la mesa con ellos! Y al final, cuando Nesta se va, Azriel le dice a Cassian que lo va a tener muy jodido, pero √©l ya no lo est√° ni escuchando porque en su cabeza se est√° imaginando todo lo que las manos de Nesta podr√≠an hacer con √©l y JODER, LES DIJE QUE ESTE LIBRO ES DEMASIADO CALIENTE. Y ESO QUE NO HA SUCEDIDO NADA.27. Uf, golpe bajo cuando, en medio de una pelea porque Nesta sigue neg√°ndose a entrenar en Windhaven, Cassian tambi√©n explota y ella le responde dici√©ndole que genial, que menos mal ya no lo va a tener babeando detr√°s de ella y que le cost√≥ mucho entender las se√±ales de que ella no lo quer√≠a. Y MALDITA SEA, OBVIAMENTE LO QUIERES. Y √âL A TI. Pero tambi√©n entiendo la reacci√≥n de querer alejar a todo el mundo cuando ni t√∫ te soportas a ti misma.***SIGUE EN COMENTARIOS***'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""3.5 stars.here comes the post-series hangover.it's safe to say that this series has my entire heart.nesta‚Äôs redemption arc is 751 pages of smutty illyrian desperation (maybe slightly too smutty?!) and self discovery. i now like nestabecausei‚Äôve also disliked her. the ugliest parts of nesta are things that i recognize in myself and that‚Äôs the beauty of this book.‚ú®a court of smut and self-help.‚ú®and, of course, men with wings are just superior in every way.ü§ç i need azriel to get his own booknow(though preferably not with elain lol)(acowar & acomaf remain my favorites from this series, but i can‚Äôt wait to see what sjm has in store for books 5 and 6.)""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '[2022] edit:changed my mind this is more of a 4 star than a 5üôÉ_________________I\'m sobbing that was so beautifulAll hailQueen Nestaand SJM for making melove her so muchI don\'t know what to do with myself now.Like actually, I think I\'m gonna be in a book hangover forweeks‚Äî no,monthsomg I cannot.

I could actually relate to Nesta and while it isn\'t as severe as her, there are times where I\'d also hate myself and feel like I deserve nothing.

It\'s just like we all think of her and hate her for that. Everyone expects Elain to be one thing, so she acts like that BUTis that truly Elain?So yeah, I judged her too early. (Feysand\'s POV really helped with this too) I shouldn\'t hate her right away because there\'s still her story to be told. I\'m actually excited to see that.But even knowing all of this, I still don\'t like Elain.ü§∑\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è I understand it and everything but just something about her rubs me off the wrong way.

Azzy have NestaAlso, something else as to why I think AzrielxElain wont be endgame is because during the solstice dance, both Cas and Eris talk about how smothered/plain Elain is wearing black, which I feel like is SJM\'s way of saying thatElain isn\'t compatible with The Night Court and it\'s darkness & shadows.ahhh I truly feel like she\'s going to go to another court in the next book.Also Azzy\'s shadowsdisappearwhen they\'re around Elain.

There is SO MUCH MORE to Eris then is shown. I really want to see more Eris and his story. I believe there\'s a lot more to him and Cas even sees that he\'s a decent guy.Oh, another thing I forgot to mention was the fact thatNesta Made three magic weaponsand one of them she named the swordAtaraxia, which meansInner Peace...I\'m in love.

Funny Story
",Emily Henry,4.24,735386,8636,"Romance, Fiction, Audiobook, Contemporary, Contemporary Romance, Adult, Chick Lit",400,23-04-2024,"A shimmering, joyful new novel about a pair of opposites with the wrong thing in common, from #1New York Timesbestselling author Emily Henry.Daphne always loved the way her fianc√©, Peter, told their story. How they met (on a blustery day), fell in love (over an errant hat), and moved back to his lakeside hometown to begin their life together. He really was good at telling it... right up until the moment he realized he was actually in love with his childhood best friend Petra.Which is how Daphne begins her new story: stranded in beautiful Waning Bay, Michigan, without friends or family but with a dream job as a children‚Äôs librarian (that barely pays the bills), and proposing to be roommates with the only person who could possibly understand her predicament: Petra‚Äôs ex, Miles Nowak.Scruffy and chaotic‚Äîwith a penchant for taking solace in the sounds of heart break love ballads‚ÄîMiles is exactly the opposite of practical, buttoned-up Daphne, whose coworkers know so little about her they have a running bet that she‚Äôs either FBI or in witness protection. The roommates mainly avoid one another, until one day, while drowning their sorrows, they form a tenuous friendship and a plan. If said plan also involves posting deliberately misleading photos of their summer adventures together, well, who could blame them?But it‚Äôs all just for show, of course, because there‚Äôs no way Daphne would actually start her new chapter by falling in love with her ex-fianc√©‚Äôs new fianc√©e‚Äôs ex... right?","[{'rating': 5, 'content': '4.75!‚ÄúAll those moments throughout the days, weeks, months that don\'t get marked on calendars with hand-drawn stars or little stickers.Those are the moments that make a life.Not grand gestures, but mundane details that, over time, accumulate until you have a home, instead of a house.The things that matter.The things I can\'t stop longing for.‚ÄùNow I am not gonna lie but this was not Emily\'s best work and after a rant withRoxyI understand that there can be some things that could have been done to make the story better but that does not change the fact that I loved reading this book and did not want it to end because you just have to read Emily Henry\'s works to understand that! Good writing is such a plus for me because if the writing isengaging and has you fully immersedin the book you probably won\'t see the problems that it has, unless its pin pointed out and this was the case with this book because I was so in love with the writing and the characters and with everything that she set up that I did not even find anything bothering me. She writes such intricate characters who you can relate with so much and you actually do feel for them, overlapped with such realistic qualities and problems that makes you relate to them and that doesn\'t make you feel alone because you see how another character faces the same problems, deals with it the same way you do and there\' just something so beautiful about it.Okay so it\'s basically about two two people Daphna and Miles both their Fianc√©es cheat on them which leads to Daphne getting kicked out of Peters house and has to stay with Miles and while they both are there, the get a wedding invitation from their exes which leads to Miles and Daphne falling into a fake relationship to make them jealous and honestly them being roommates as well was so hot. It was different from other fake dating tropes because of the way it was set but the way it unraveled could have been something more. There\'s this quote during this scene where Daphne tells Miles of what she did that I laughed at and smiled stupidly at:""Wait!\' He braces his hands against the counter, face brightening. ""So he called to try to make you feel so pathetic you wouldn\'t come ruin his special day and you told him we were dating?\'\'Im sorry,\' I say again.\'That fucking rules,\' He says. \'How\'d he take it?""Daphne and Miles were such good characters and I kind of think that there could have been more depth to them but I still enjoyed the way that they were written in like Daphne self doubting herself because of her father always left her after promising that he was there to stay and I loved how she got over it and finally confessed her feeling by giving an angry rant on his phone because he needed that and I also appreciated the bond that she had with her mother although I do think that we could have gotten more one on one scenes for them and as for Miles, I loved him so much and its with all Emily Henry\'s men, I see myself in them.. be it Gus, Wyn, Charlie, Alex or Miles theres always something within them that I find I can relate too and for here with Miles was how he texts, the way he overuses the word nice which bugRoxyoff so much but for me the thing that I related to him the most was whereHe panicked and reacted anxiously and then realized what he had done a little too lateI won\'t elaborate on that because that would be a spoiler but I did get him during that scene but besides that scene, Miles was such a cute and hot too?? loved him. There was one thing that I appreciated as well but thought more could have been done was Miles past with her mother and how it turned him into who he was, always overlooking peoples negative side, never lashing out and always being nice(?)Their banter that I loved:""True,\' he says \'but I haven\'t had any luck yet tracking down the stretch of beach where thirtysomethings go to smoke weed\'\'Oh, they\'re all just vaping from their beds while watching HGTV\'\'Not us,\' he says\'No, we\'re adventurous\' I say""_""I turn to look at him. \'Even when you try to be mean, you\'re nice,\'His eyes seem to spark when he smiles. \'I\'ll try harder.""_""Do me a favor,\' he says lightly, \'Unlock your door.\'\'Why?\'\'So I can push you out as I peel out of the parking lot,\' he says,\'You would never,\' I say\'I would never\' he admits.""_‚ÄúDrink.

Another bond that I liked but thought some scenes could have been explored more was of Miles and his sister JUlie they were just so wholesome and cute and deserve the whole world.""You\'re worth it, Daphne,"" he says, hand soft on my jaw and eyes closed.\'Miles?\' I whisper. \'I do, I do what all those parts of you\'His eyes open, molten, warm, \'Good,\' He says. \'They want you too.\'Then he kisses me.""The romance was honestly the horniest Emily has ever been it was not I would say insta-lust because there was development and it wasn\'t like \' oh one look and im hard\' but it was that instead of the intense pining, proximity and slow burn, they just acted on what they felt. I am a sucker for slow burn and wanted more but I cant deny how much I enjoyed reading the scenes. Also, the way emily henry also writes poetic smut?? Like??? How can you do that woman. Despite it being her horniest, it was very well balanced.Now,The things that could have been better;(spoilers)(credits;roxy)1, More drama as we were promised a wedding which could have increased the sexual tension, the fake dating part and the drama a lot.2, Daphne going to her mom to rant like we saw Rory do with Lorelai in Gilmore Girls.3, Male povs because having Miles\'s POV would have been so interesting since would\'ve gotten his emotional scene with Julie and it wouldve been more showing and less telling.4, More drama by Miles\'s mother meeting them and this book being at least 200 pages moreNowthe scenes that I loved1, When Daphne gets dumped and throws almonds at Petra and Peter2, Miles and Daphne hanging out across the town3, The cherry hill scene with Ashleigh, Miles and Daphne4, Daphne making it up to Ashleigh5, Miles going to confront Daphne\'s dad6, The cute tender moments between Miles and Daphne that will make you feel single.7, the milkshake, fries and beach scene.Overall, a fantastic read that I will definitely read again and again despite some things that could have been added.Ratings for her other books:1, Beach read: 52, Happy place: 53, Funny story: 4.754, People we meet on vacation: 4.55, Book lovers: 4.02Special shoutout toRoxyfor getting me to read all of Emily\'s books last year and hearing my rants about it.

This is my first Emily Henry book that turned out being such a letdown for me, as I was a big fan of the rest of her stories, or at least most of them. I\'m still not entirely sure if the title was meant to refer to the way our two main characters, Miles and Daphne, began their relationship ‚Äî ""You know, Funny Story.. my fianc√© dumped me for his childhood best friend, who happened to be Miles‚Äôs girlfriend, and that‚Äôs how we ended up living together, and then I accidentally told my ex-fianc√© that Miles and I are dating, so now we are fake dating."", or if it was just meant to suggest that this would be a fun story to read. Maybe it even refers to both of these options at the same time ‚Äî which is most likely, but unfortunately, as I already said, it didn\'t end up to be a fun read for me.As usual, as in every Emily Henry book, we have a book-loving character, this time a librarian ‚Äî Daphne, who turned out to be quite an okay heroine for me. I could relate to her in a few ways and if I had to choose which main character I liked more, I would point at her, but at the same time, she wasn\'t even close to the bond I had with January, who I\'m starting to think will always be my favorite heroine of this author. I probably would have felt more than just ""quite okay"" about her if she hadn\'t moaned every time she ate something, but like I said, she wasn\'t that bad. I actually loved that she stood her ground and never considered going back to her cheating ex-fianc√©, unlike our hero who wasn\'t so sure about it and who, speaking of which ‚Äî let\'s get to him now.Miles Nowak, our Bridget Jones\'s Diary-watching, spicy-woodsy-smelling (like every other romance book hero), Crocs-loving hero who as for now is my least favorite Emily Henry male character. Yes, he had some good moments, but instead of screaming, blushing, and kicking my feet for how wonderful he was with Daphne, I kept thinking about these facts about him""Miles looks up at me.‚ÄúThey,‚Äù I say, ‚Äúsuck.‚Äù‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the love of my life,‚Äù he says.‚ÄúThe love of your life sucks,‚Äù I tell him.""The love of your life? Hell no. I didn\'t like that he said that about his cheating ex-girlfriend, so I expected him to say the same thing about the heroine later in the book, but that didn\'t happen. I know he loved Daphne and chose her, but this quote left a bitter taste in my mouth.Or when the question was asked ""if they would get back together with their exes"" and Daphne\'s answer was this""Would he take her back? I find myself wondering, before seamlessly transitioning into Would I take Peter back?‚ÄúDefinitely not,‚ÄùI say aloud.""and Miles‚Äôs that""Petra was the exception, not the rule, for me. So if she wanted to get back together?I don‚Äôt know.But it‚Äôs not worth thinking about, since she‚Äôs engaged to your ex-boyfriend.‚ÄùShe cheated on you with her best friend?!? What do you mean ""I don‚Äôt know.""?? It should have been ""No."" from the very beginning when you found out about it.The worst moment in the book that confirmed me why he is my least favorite Emily Henry hero was when he went to see his ex when she called him crying and because of that he left Daphne waiting for him.""And then Petra called, and she was sobbing. So hard I couldn‚Äôt understand her. I‚Äôd never seen her cry before. I honestly thought someone had died. She asked if I could come see her, and I said yes. Because I was worried.I still care about her.‚ÄùShecheated on youand then a month later was engaged to her best friend!?! What do mean you still care about her??""I didn‚Äôt mean to tell her first.‚Äù The tops of his cheeks redden. ‚ÄúThat I‚Äôm in love with you.""And then the first person to know he loved Daphne was also his ex. You know that feeling when you read a romance novel and you just feel that the hero loves the heroine? In Miles\' case it was the opposite. Throughout the book, I had the impression that if his ex-girlfriend wanted to come back to him, he would welcome her with open arms. Only at the end of the book, when he did one thing, I was like ""Hmm, okay, maybe he loves Daphne then."". But as I just said, I only started feeling it at the end of the book. All the things I mentioned, plus the fact that a month after the breakup he still kept pictures of her in his room instead of burning them, are why he will probably always be my least favorite Emily character.I don\'t even know what to say about the romance part of the book because it was boring as the chemistry between Daphne and Miles seemed non-existent to me. They finally confessed their love to each other, and the only thing I felt was happiness, because I knew that this book would end soon. I guess that alone says enough how much I enjoyed their love story.I never expected that reading Emily Henry\'s book would evoke so many unpleasant emotions in me, and yet, as you can see, it unfortunately happened. I hope I\'m in the minority of people who feel this way, because Emily\'s book being one of the biggest disappointments of the year wasn‚Äôt on my bingo card.‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄMe at my graduation: üòêMe at my wedding: üòêMe when Emily Henry announces a new book: üòçüòçüò©üò©üòªüòªüòªüòçü•∞ü•∞üòçü•∞'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I give this book 4.5 stars, rounded up to steamy forced proximity, friends to lovers, opposites attraction. In no way can I give any Emily Henry book less than five stars.This book isn\'t my favorite among Emily Henry\'s works. ""Happy Place"" holds that position, while ""People We Meet on Vacation"" is my least favorite of hers. (By the way, both earned five stars from me, so I have to work on a different grading system for Henry‚Äôs books like triple five stars, minus five stars, etc. But I\'m sure each of her books will become my favorite romance readings of the year, even though Colleen Hoover releases a book at the same time. Yep, ColHo fans, I‚Äôm one of yours, but fair is fair! Emily Henry is a true musician and poet playing the strings of my heart.)But let\'s be honest: Miles Nowak is the BEST BOYFRIEND Emily Henry has created! He‚Äôs caring, a charm magnet, selfless, easy-going, adventurous ‚Äì not only the best boyfriend but also the best male friend any woman seeks. His irresistible hotness is the cherry on top. I\'m usually irritated by the heroes Emily Henry creates, but so far, Miles has exceeded them with his good heart, sense of humor, naturalness, without having a selfish bone in his body!I have to admit I had doubts when I first decided to read this book because I\'ve never been a fan of love triangles or ex-lover situations. When they are involved, things get messier, and emotions get blurrier. Most characters do something irritating, missing the ex or trying to rekindle, which pisses me off.I won\'t give spoilers, but I can say this: the situation of becoming roommates with your ex-fianc√©e‚Äôs new fianc√©e‚Äôs ex-boyfriend couldn‚Äôt be handled very gently and fairly. Both Daphne and Miles are wise, analyzing their situations very reasonably. When they accidentally find themselves in a fake dating situation, they even share their thoughts honestly. That‚Äôs why I loved both of the characters. They know their own flaws, weaknesses, and they don‚Äôt whine or obsess over their exes. They hold each other to get through the trauma, and from their mutual tragic incident, a beautiful, unique friendship is born. I loved how they slowly lowered down their barriers, learning to explore themselves and the huge life awaiting them. They acted so mature and were so careful not to be each other‚Äôs rebound, even though the sparks fly and burn the apartment they share to the ground.The plot revolves around Daphne, who loves the story of how she met her fianc√©e Peter until he dumps her after the bachelor party to choose his childhood friend Petra over her, giving her one week to move from their shared house, heading to the Amalfi Coast with his new girlfriend! Yes, what a jerk! Homeless and hopeless, Daphne, who recently left her old life behind to start a new life with Peter, finds Miles: Petra‚Äôs dumped a few minutes ago boyfriend at Peter‚Äôs door, and she pops up the question: is there any vacant room at your apartment?Yes, the equation might be too complicated. Daphne: reserved, tight-lipped, buttoned-up children‚Äôs librarian living with a carefree, adventurous, pothead guy who is working odd jobs, as her ex-fianc√©e defined. But when they get an invitation to Petra & Peter‚Äôs wedding, their very reserved roommate relationship changes after a night ends at the bar, and both of them decide to RSVP to the wedding. And guess what? The same day Peter makes a pity call that leads Daphne to lie about her relationship situation with Miles. She says they are dating, and thankfully Miles plays along with her game.But what if she misjudged Miles from the beginning? This self-deprecating, friendly guy who always puts others before him, comes to the library to cheer him up when she reads books to the kids, takes him places in town she has never seen, helps her open her mind and heart, rediscovering herself. Is he the guy her heart wants?Well, I loved Miles, I loved Daphne & Miles\' love story, and the beautiful epilogue in the end! No more words! Emily Henry never disappoints me! She meticulously solved this challenging relationship equation with the best possible outcome! Go on!

(the woman writes a mean substack.)there were a few things i didn\'t love about this book. it tries to fitso muchinto a few hundred pages: our protagonist, daphne, is left by her fiance weeks before her wedding, causing her to: move in with miles, her fiance\'s new girlfriend\'s ex-boyfriend; realize she has no friends; begin a quest to find herself; get over the fianc√© and fall in love with miles; join a variety of community groups and neighborhood activities; make her current job her dream job; repress some CLEAR mommy issues i thought we were going to address, and fully get over her daddy issues.all of this is happening so much.it comes at a cost, which is that typical emily henry magic (and i don\'t just mean the bygone magical realism i mourn every day and never shut up about).this book is not quite as funny ‚Äî jokes feel forced, sometimes to the point that you can only identify something as reaching for funny because the character ""joked"" or ""played along"" instead of ""said.""it is not quite as polished, with writing feeling a bit unconfident, full of words italicized for emphasis and, you know, the whole verbs that aren\'t said thing. (there are a LOT of dialogue attribution words that aren\'t ""said."")and the characters have none of their usual better-version-of-reality charm. miles\' nick miller archetype would never work for me personally, but my real issue with him is that his character traits fade once we\'re supposed to see him as a romantic prospect. our side characters, ashleigh and julia, feel like interchangeable joke-bots to the point of being vaguely threatening. (when they pop up on page in tandem i feel a sense of unease.)and to be honest, daphne has no self awareness. because there\'s so much happening in this book, everything has to be incredibly simple: daphne\'s issue with her dad, AND daphne\'s issue with miles, AND daphne\'s friends\' issue with daphne all has to be the same. it makes for some moments of ridiculousness ‚Äî like how can daphne be melting down about being wronged on the same city block where she realized several hours earlier she had wronged someone in that exact same way? how could she be so unwilling to give the grace she expects for herself? and how could emily henry set scenes of this book on a cherry farm in michigan when she knew what it would do to me, specifically?!sorry. that\'s the last time i\'ll bring up magical realism. i think.ol\' daph just has too much to figure out about herself. i think this abandonment would be so completely traumatic even if she HADN\'T built her entire life around her fianc√© only to be left entirely alone, and even if it WASN\'T eerily similar to her daddy issues, and even if she DIDN\'T have a bunch of unresolved things going on up in ye olde memory palace, that the last thing she\'d be doing is sticking around someone else\'s hometown flirting with her new roomie.especially since what she ends up doing is repeating the exact same cycle with no awareness at all.and in the worst offense, miles\' illiterate texting style reminded me of the himbos i used to date (date doing a lot of heavy lifting here) in my wayward youth. which should be a jailable offense in and of itself.bottom line: like anything emily henry has ever written, this is better than a lot of books. it just isn\'t better than most emily henry ones.----------------------currently-reading updateme

books. book lovers is in my top 5 books of all time (and i am not a romance reader), and happy place is the only book that made me cry last year. time is truly measured in emily henry releases for me.my current emily henry rom com ranking is: book lovers (5 stars), happy place (5 stars), beach read (4.5 stars), funny story (3 stars), and people we meet on vacation (2.5 stars). if we have completely different rankings, you\'ll probably feel differently about this book!if you are a big romance reader (reading booksforthe romance), you will most likely enjoy this a lot. but if you are a lit fic reader who loves emily henry books for the protagonists and their introspection and the fact that her romance feels grounded and realistic (me), this might be a slight miss. it\'s been a while since i\'ve described an emily henry book as just ""good"", but this one feels like that for me.funny story still has emily henry\'s signature witty dialogue and chemistry between miles and daphne. it is arguably her most commercial romance to date, filled with more romantic scenes between the two characters. daphne, after being dumped by her fianc√© for his best friend, decides to room with miles, who was dumped by said best friend. in classic emily henry rom com style, funny story is set in a beautiful town in the midwest (michigan), charged with quick banter and heart to hearts between the characters. in this vein, the book felt like a mix of beach read and book lovers, in a sense.but not really. while it\'s impossible for me to dislike a emily henry book because of her writing, much of my enjoyment as a reader comes from being able to see myself and parts of my personality reflected through either protagonist. for book lovers, it was overwhelmingly nora, for happy place, it was harriet, for beach read, it was gus, and for people we meet on vacation, it was alex. and so on.the main qualm i had with funny story is that neither miles nor daphne felt relatable to me, which made it a less enjoyable read than her other books. this is why i say that my neutral stance on this book is most likely a personal one. daphne and miles both felt very confusing to me as characters, almost as if they were hybrids of emily henry\'s previous characters. i couldn\'t quite get either of their characterizations or defining traits. there is not a single emily henry book i didn\'t read in one sitting...until this one.like i mentioned above, a big reason for my love for emily henry books is her protagonists and how their introspection does not read like other commercial romance books, but more like literary fiction. her characters are well thought through, reflective, and very three dimensional. nora was literally just me from start to finish (so i don\'t have to really put forth a defense about three dimensionality). harriet\'s introspection on loneliness and living for other people genuinely changed my life. but daphne didn\'t really have any.the chemistry and get-together also felt a bit rushed and forced at times, and the dialogue and heart to hearts felt less genuine and blander than her other books. for a book called funny story, it was...not. i think my big issue was just with miles as well. he just didn\'t enough charisma and charm for this book to be memorable for me. wyn and alex didn\'t really either, but i related a lot to alex and wyn was redeemed through harriet.funny story is a great read and definitely still a cut above other romance books. but this one just didn\'t do it for me. i really hope her next release works for me!thank you

fascinating is the loyalty of her readers; going to your nearest bookstore on release day for a book that is probably no less than $30 ‚Äî that‚Äôs dedication. and you know what, i think i finally get it.i didn‚Äôt have particularly high expectations for funny story, but in all transparency, this just might be my favorite book of hers, hovering right above beach read (which i thoroughly enjoyed) and book lovers (of which i have no recollection but still think highly). it‚Äôs far from perfect, but it does a lot of things well, and that‚Äôs quite a feat considering it‚Äôs less than 400 pages (proof that less is more!) and, according to the reviews i‚Äôve seen, her most ‚Äúromantic‚Äù romance novel yet.still ‚Äî i think funny story, like her other books, straddles the line between lighthearted romcom and introspective women‚Äôs fiction. the banter in this one is some of the best she‚Äôs written ‚Äî it‚Äôs reread worthy, the kind that makes you laugh out loud. the characters themselves are wonderfully written; it‚Äôs obvious that emily henry adores them. she crafted miles and daphne with so much care and thought, adding dimension to the characters through their experiences and focusing on how said experiences changed and ultimately shaped them into the miles and daphne we read about in this book. it‚Äôs rare for me to like one mc in a romance book, let alone both, but daphne felt so relatable ‚Äî her thoughts mirrored my very own at times. and miles i had a soft spot for because how could you not? he‚Äôsthis is me tryingpersonified. and the romance? god, the romance. i‚Äôm a harsh rater, even more so when it comes to contemporary romance. but in every! one! of! her! books! emily henry prioritizes the emotional connection between the two main characters. and the way she develops their relationship and has them slowly open up to each other? it gets me. every. time. i live for their vulnerable moments, for their conversations about their pasts, about what haunts them, as much as i live for their banter.despite this being first and foremost a romance, it is also a story about rediscovering yourself, relearning who you are and what you like and what you want out of life. it‚Äôs a reminder to live for yourself, to spend your days with the people you love, to love them without restraint or inhibition. the ending is beautifully uplifting, the last sentence tying back to the very first, the tone hopeful and reassuring. it‚Äôs what i think i needed right now as someone who‚Äôs entering her twenties and is so intimidated by the unknown, who‚Äôs tempted to run away from the unpredictability of it all. and i‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a book i‚Äôll come back to when, in five years, my life will probably make even less sense than it does now.thank you to netgalley and berkley publishing for the arc üíì'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Can a book survive on nothing but banter? Well,Funny Storysure tries.Okay, all you rabid Emily Henry fans. Before you chuck your rotten eggs at me, please let me explain.If ever there was an Emily Henry book that I should connect with, it's this one. Daphne is a librarian (my dream job) and she's in a pretend relationship with her roommate, Miles, in order to get back at her ex-fianc√© (an intriguing premise). And yet, something was missing. I kept waiting for the story to grab me, and it never really did.I hate to say it, but the crux of the problem is that the whole thing was rather forgettable. I only just finished the book, and already I hardly remember anything about it. The characters, the interactions, even the conflicts, while all feelgood on the surface, were in fact fairly bland underneath.I enjoy a low-stakes beach read as much as the next gal, but there is a difference between low stakes and no stakes, and this was too much in the latter. At no point was there anything really on the line. The story just shambled along, with lots of banter and some minor conflicts here and there, until the requisite 300-some pages were met, and then it was called a book.Speaking of the conflicts, I totally didn't understand Daphne and Miles' issues, or even Daphne and Ashleigh's. Do people really get so upset and potentially break up relationships and friendships over such small issues? And each one, blown up to be so important, can only be resolved after much back and forth, with pages upon pages of dialogue of each person's feelings and the associated parental trauma that was at the root of all their misgivings. It was a bit much.Don't get me wrong, I did have fun. There were entertaining moments, and the banter was truly top notch. And it wasn't just for the main couple during romantic moments. No, the banter was interspersed everywhere and among everyone, so we got plenty of chuckle-worthy moments.But you can't just sustain a story on banter alone, no matter how delightful it is. When the characters feel as lackluster as Daphne and Miles and their conflicts equally bland and forced, it was hard to care either way if they ended up together, which is always a bad sign in a romance.I feel like I'm the only person out there who doesn't get heart-eyes at the merest mention of an Emily Henry book. My experiences so far have been largely underwhelming, or maybe I just haven't read the right books by her. Either way, I'll add this to the pile of Emily Henry books I've pretty much forgotten the moment I finished.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:Beach ReadPeople We Meet on Vacation~~~~~~~~~~~~‚úßConnect with me‚úßInstagram‚úß""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'funny story? ha. ain‚Äôt nothing funny about the way my heart was tugged while reading this book. emily henry im under your bed cuz why‚Äôd you write a fmc that has the same thoughts and fears as me?!? üíÄopposites attract has never been written better than before this.

Sometimes, just when it feels like smooth sailing on the raft you call a life, an unexpected fucker of a wave smashes your plans to splinters and send you off course and adrift. Such is the case for Daphne in Emily Henry‚Äôs charming new novel,Funny Story, whose life has been shipwrecked upon the shores of a Lake Michigan vacation town with the ex of her ex‚Äôs new fiance. You read that right, and these mutual exes are such a smart match they are practically named after each other, Peter and Petra, so out with the tweed and in with the twee I suppose. But, as Daphne learns, sometimes a shipwreck can be a new start to something more beautiful. One of this books biggest strengths in allowing the narrative to wade through sorrows to create a portrait of adults discovering how to carry their own baggage and how their interactions with others are affected by it with a lot of the drama not being a miscommunication trope, per say, but more people tripping themselves up into confirmation bias based on their own personal traumas. It has some grit that grounds the otherwise breezy narrative and the real love story is learning to love oneself in order to love and be loved. It does wrap up a bit overly idyllic but honestly, I felt the biggest cracks in the veneer of the story was when it tried to make things happier than it probably needed to be but I understand why that is the case. With her signature witty banter, wry humor, and characters that are easy to fall in love with as they fall apart and into love themselves,Funny Storyis a endearing tale about picking up the pieces only to discover oneself amidst the wreckage, learn to be yourself for yourself, and find a love where you least expect.‚ÄòThe same universe that dispassionately takes things away can bring you things you weren't imaginative enough to dream up.‚ÄôAlright let‚Äôs talk about love and stuff (surprise: the ‚Äústuff‚Äù is trauma!) I foundFunny Storyto read as a much quieter novel than most of Emily Henry‚Äôs works, but also found that, coupled with a slow-burn plot that lets scenes and character introspection really breathe, to be part of what made it so endearing for me. This will probably take some criticism for being slow but my favorite books are the sort that don‚Äôt exactly have what most people call a ‚Äúplot‚Äù soooo this was fine for me.Funny Storyreads more along the lines of the coziness inBook Loverswhile also being more successful than I foundHappy Placeto be. Having just readLynn Painter‚ÄôsHappily Never After, I felt like this was a successful version of the many things that story tried to be (both books, however, have a thing about eating pizza being sexy which‚Ä¶ok‚Ä¶???) where the characters actually felt their age, the fake dating felt plausible, the third act drama was passably believable for the genre. It does try to tie up too many loose ends and solve all the issues and I don't think we needed that, but I suppose cliches are cliche for a reason and there are expectations in genres so thats more a Me thing. And like, sure there's a lot to pick at but also it‚Äôs aiming to be a fun book and it lands that aspect while also managing to have a dynamic look at how past hurts can haunt our self-esteem and hinder our vulnerability when trying to connect with others and that helped hold the story together. One person's breakdown is another person‚Äôs novel glue I guess? Wait, I think I just finally understood literature.‚ÄòYou can't force a person to show up, but you can learn a lesson when they don't.‚ÄôThis is a fairly character driven narrative of self-discovery and trauma processing that just so happens to stumble into romance so having the characters be in their early 30s helped bring this to life. Also that everything sucks and they just keep having to go to work and smile because they work public facing jobs‚ÄìI FELT THAT SO HARD. I‚Äôve found in similar novels that the characters felt far too young for their ages whereasFunny Storycaptures being an adult but not having the stable career/family/housing/etc that would make one ‚Äúfeel adult.‚Äù It's a very Millennial narrative where jokes like ‚Äòare we evil or just immature?‚Äô to laugh off behavior felt very true to life and all these characters seemed to walk onto the page directly out of the sort of single, early 30s service industry folks I‚Äôve known and been friends with. But it also positions the characters in the wreckage of their Round 1 attempt at adulthood where they can no longer pretend they aren‚Äôt a product of their past and have to weigh out how their past traumas and coping mechanisms have embedded into their personalities. Especially since both Miles and Daphne are still reeling from hurts caused by the actions of their parents and don‚Äôt have a healthy relationship to serve as a compass for their own (and Daphne‚Äôs father is still a source of constant disappointment). ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want you to look at me like I‚Äôm broken,‚Äô Miles says at one point and this cuts to the heart of how these character‚Äôs present themselves: eager to show they are alright while feeling far from fine inside and wanting to hide that.‚ÄôIt‚Äôs easy to be loved by the ones who‚Äôve never seen you fuck up. The ones you‚Äôve never had to apologize to, and who still think all your ‚Äòquirks‚Äô are charming.‚ÄôSince so much of dating involves understanding each other‚Äôs defense mechanisms and unpacking how past traumas inform your interpersonal relationships, being able to be vulnerable is important to intimacy andFunny Storydoes well by showing how frustrating it can be to open yourself up at the same emotional places where you are currently bruised. Though, speaking of intimacy, readers should know Emily Henry is not a closed-door romance writer (as Ashleigh says it is ‚Äòdefinitely not PG‚Äô) and while the sex scenes are fairly awkward here (I suspect the term ‚Äúcringe‚Äù will get used in a lot of reviews) I think thats part of their charm as these are just‚Ä¶awkward people. Henry wrote a rather humorous article (read itHERE) on how to write sex scenes and the key detail she returns to several times is vulnerability and embracing the awkward, but also using the scenes to progress the characters.‚ÄòThe scene has to change things. Because every scene has to change things.And that‚Äôs it. As close as I think I could get teaching someone to write (or rewrite) a sex scene. You have to treat it like any other scene, because that‚Äôs what it is‚Ä¶It has to move the story. It has to shift the emotional landscape. It doesn‚Äôt have to be universally deemed sexy (it can‚Äôt; people like different things) and it doesn‚Äôt have to avoid the territory of cringe (it won‚Äôt, for the aforementioned reason). It simply has to be true to the story.‚ÄôWhile I‚Äôm not sure the scenes here really count as plot progression, I found the awkwardness that leaves the characters rather flustered and confused about their relationship to work as part of the character study that seems to be the focus of this book. Its a novel about finding yourself but thankfully its not white folks ‚Äúfinding themselves‚Äù by going to India or Joshua Tree listening to The Doors, its just getting high and watching action movies with your roommate and getting some ‚Äúaccidental‚Äù action of your own.‚ÄòShe‚Äôs a walking fantasy and I‚Äôm a librarian who actually does wear a lot of buttons and tweed.‚ÄôLearning to love oneself in all your faults and failures is difficult, but the joy in the discovery of what makes you ‚Äúyou‚Äù comes alive through Daphne quite well. The set up is pretty great and Henry launches you into it rather quickly. I do enjoy how it sort of mimics the set up inBook Loverswhere she gets dumped in a very romcom ending ‚ÄúI realized my best friend was my love all along‚Äù way like Daphne is the discard fiance that barely gets any lines and seems lame anyways (so I guess shoutout to anyone who maybe identified with Mark Ruffalo‚Äôs fiance in13 Going On 30?). This is just another incident in a long line of feeling not important in the lives of those who claim to love you, and having had an absentee father taught her a few self-defense mechanisms long ago:‚ÄòTrust people‚Äôs actions, not their words.Don‚Äôt love anyone who isn‚Äôt ready to love you back.Let go of the people who don‚Äôt hold on to you.Don‚Äôt wait on people who don‚Äôt jury for you.‚ÄôBeing free from a relationship she thought would sail her happily from life has also made her reflect on how she never really formed a solid sense of self and instead allowed a relationship to fill in all the blanks for her. ‚ÄòI always cleaved to people I love and tried to orient my orbit around them,‚Äô she realizes, which was an attempt to ‚Äòmake myself unleavable.‚Äô And guess what? They all left. But now she has a new opportunity to find herself in it all.‚ÄòIm not sure which parts of me are him and which parts are genuinely my own and I want to know. I want to know myself, to test my edges and see where I stop and the rest of the world begins.‚ÄôHaving also ended up in a Michigan lakeshore vacation town only for my supposedly ‚Äúgot it together‚Äù lifeplans to go down like the Edmund Fitzgerald (if you are from Michigan you are required to love the Edmund Fitzgerald and think of the Great Lakes like some fierce god that gives life but takes it away. Any museum is like ‚ÄúScience/Art/History/etc is so cool!‚Äù Michigan museums are like ‚Äúthe Lake is a cruel mistress who will kill you and everyone you love!‚Äù), this all resonated with me. Too much maybe. But I loved seeing her come to love it and find her own place. ‚ÄòI feel embarrassing pride at having become a regular at someplace new all on my own,‚Äô she thinks about becoming a familiar face in a coffee shop. Can confirm that is a cool feeling when you feel utterly alone in the world. Good for you, Daphne, find your place.‚ÄòThere‚Äôs no place on this earth like Waning Bay.‚ÄôSpeaking of place, Emily Henry excels at capturing a sense of place and embedding it into her narratives as if the local community itself were a supporting cast character in her romcoms. It helps, too, that her locales tend to offer plenty of comedic relief along with their atmosphere. Henry has spoken at length about the importance of ‚Äúplace‚Äù in crafting her novelsin interviews, stating that ‚ÄòI want my characters to feel like they grew up in the place where [my books are] set.‚Äô InFunny Story, however, we watch Daphne as she has to learn a new place being stuck in a Northern Michigan vacation community, but it is less the way learning a place is about learning to better understand her love interest as it was inBook Loversand more about learning to understand herself. Luckily she is aided by her new roommate, Miles, who also had to find his way amidst this community after shipwrecking there himself (can relate, buddy). Henry captures these Michigan communities in highly specific and humorous ways while making it still relatable to those unfamiliar with them. Maybe I‚Äôm biased and Daphne being a librarian and Miles being a bartender at a cherry themed wine bar is just something I‚Äôd enjoy because I work in a library after having myself been a wine bartender at a cherry themed establishment. But aspects of Michigan vacation towns felt so true to life. I laughed at the bar named ‚ÄúBARn‚Äù which is so eye-rollingly Michigan. But also aspects like seeing a young couple that are ‚Äòon a first date which might somehow be an actual vacation,‚Äô or everyone having their ‚Äúcorn guy, jam connection or cheesemonger, or someone saying things like being on the water is probably what church is to some folks. But for real, if you need amazing tomatoes, I know a guy.‚ÄòA good librarian makes all the difference.‚ÄôThe side characters are great as well, like the younger sister who brings in a lot of heartfelt discussions on family dynamics in response to family traumas, or the single-mom librarian. The library aspects are a bit kitschy but charming and I‚Äôm glad Henry presents the very real issues of how much blatant sexual harassment librarians face or the random moments of extreme anger or weirdness and how we just‚Ä¶deal with it and move along like a blip in the day. I usually hate when authors add libraries or librarians into plots because it's so stereotypically twee or inaccurate but Henry pulls it off well. Back to the sister for a moment, I thought the age gap between siblings was explored in a pretty comically-true-to-life way and how it wasn‚Äôt miscommunication between them but just‚Ä¶lack of communicating at all because you just assume what the other person is thinking. Which, okay real. That plays into the third act drama as well where its less a miscommunication and more falling victim to your own confirmation bias and assumptions. But Miles is sweet. I really liked Miles, guys. Miles feels like people I've met, especially in my bartending days. Also a coworker told me they think Miles is based on me. He‚Äôs not, I don‚Äôt own crocs (shoutout to the cover artist for including that). Did he do something sort of uncool at the end that Daphne is understandably upset about? Yes. Not great. But also did it feel like...well, something you'd hear a friend tell you about why their mad at a guy? Absolutely.I also don't know if this actually needed a successful romance? Maybe that's just me but the aspect about loving yourself and existing outside the circle of your partner was pretty great and we could have left it at that.‚ÄòA second act I fell into, and the home that I chose, as much as it chose me.I can‚Äôt wait. I can‚Äôt wait for this whole world I‚Äôve invited to surprise me.‚ÄôAll in all,Funny Storyis a sweet story of summer, libraries and finding joy in a new town and new friend. What I really loved about this book‚Äîeven when it made me cry because Isobbedat the end‚Äîis how it just felt like people interacting with people and stumbling through their own issues instead of having some driving plot pushing people in directions. What I‚Äôm getting at is they felt like people instead of chess pieces for the sake of plot. The third act drama is done well too. Though when Henry tries to tell you that Michiganders refer to vacationers as ‚Äúfudgies‚Äù for coming here to get our fudge (which is yum)...no we don‚Äôt. But the people from the Upper Peninsula DO in fact call the lower Peninsula ‚Äútrolls.‚Äù Nobody in this novel says ‚Äúope‚Äù though, which is the Michigan noise for everything. Daphne should have said ‚Äúope‚Äù during a sex scene, I would have fallen over and then made this novel the State flag or something. Anyways, I enjoyed this and I hope you will too.4/5‚ÄòFamily. The real kind, who will always love you, even when your decisions make no sense to them.‚ÄôUPDATE: I totally bought the Emily Henry merch shirt for this book.

I rarely sink the time into people and just conclude they'll be an acquaintance.Miles is a top tier guy, I would totally date him in real life and he'd give me so many butterflies - I'd also think he was being 'just nice' like Daphne did and not that he actually liked me.I love Julia and Ashleigh as well - such girls girls, I would love to have friends like them.

Miles didn‚Äôt have any outstanding or charming qualities in my opinion and i was pretty indifferent about him for the majority of the book. i thought he would win me over eventually, but eh, he never did.the story itself was not the bestest and most interesting i‚Äôve ever read, but the positive thing is that it was keeping me somewhat entertained. even with its issues, i was not bored and i wanted to keep reading more and more. i even started feeling a tad hopeful that things would improve at some point because i could see some potential there. but guess what? it did not improve. in fact, it got worse.i don‚Äôt know where exactly things started going wrong, all i can tell you is that after 50% i lost all my interest in the story.i assume it might be because of the romance. Daphne and Miles started having more ‚Äúromantic‚Äù scenes and i was not interested in that. not even a little bit. from the beginning, i couldn‚Äôt feel any chemistry between them and their romantic interactions were all so cringe and unnatural to me. just unpleasing to read. so yeah, it actually makes sense why i lost interest when they really started becoming more than friends.i genuinely enjoyed the friendship between these two, their dynamic as friends was fun and sweet, but as a couple? oh, absolutely NOT. when i read romance books i surely expect to root for the main characters to end up together, because duh, butFunny Storymade me do the exact opposite. Daphne and Miles should‚Äôve stayed as friends and friends only and i‚Äôll die on this hill. no one can convince me otherwise. it‚Äôs not even just because i think they havezerochemistry, there are another million reasons why i think that that they shouldn‚Äôt be a couple. the biggest one is that neither of them were very prepared to embark in another serious relationship so quickly (nor they should). they should take care of themselves first and get therapy instead.on top of that, the author also started coming up with unnecessary and tedious subplots. like for example the dad subplot ‚Äî the most boring ‚Äî and i just... couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. i was getting more and more annoyed and the urge to give up was very strong at that point, but i kept pushing through. i don‚Äôt know why, though? it wasn‚Äôt even worth it.then... when i thought it couldn‚Äôt get any worse... the author throws in a ‚ú®third act conflict‚ú® and what a stupid, irritating third act conflict it was. was it even necessary? it came out of nowhere and the whole thing felt way too forced and annoying.i got so angry at Miles‚Äô actions and i don‚Äôt think Daphne was that wrong or immature for reacting the way she did. the conflict just proves my point that they! were! not! ready! for! a! relationship! (well, mainly Miles.)ironically, for a book calledFunny Story, this wasn‚Äôt funny at all. it‚Äôs not the worst book i‚Äôve ever read (trust me when i say i‚Äôve read worse) but it‚Äôs not one of the best either... it was just not for me i guess. i still recommend it, though ‚Äî i feel like others might like it more than me. i certainly hope they do.ìÇÉ ‚öù ìÇÉ ‡πã. ‚Çä Íí∞ ‚úâÔ∏èfavorite quotes.

As a kid, I just felt so fucking scared and powerless, all the time, and now, I just need to be okay.‚Äù‚ûõ and this is also just such a book about community, and carving out space and safety and love with the people who you trust and want to build a home with. especially when you‚Äôve lived a life of not really having much stability, and the thought of it being taken away makes you scared to start to build it.‚ûõ libraries will always be the heart of cities, with some of the most powerful tools we have to amplify voices and create change. i am actually typing this up during national library week here, and i just can't emphasize enough how important these buildings, these safe spaces filled with heart, and these librarians are. i would get so emotional when daphne would talk about the kids at her branch, and the books she‚Äôd pick because of them. ahhhh, a reminder to just show up for your local library, do donations if you are able (time, books, and money), make sure your library card is updated, just show your appreciation in every way you‚Äôre able to.‚ÄúTo me, libraries have always represented the best of humanity. The way we all share knowledge and space, and... and how we find ways to look after each other. It's not a perfect system, but it's powerful.‚Äùoverall, this just had so much to love. actually, as i am typing this i am considering making this a five star. I‚Äôm just not sure if i loved this as much asbeach read, but it is for sure a new favorite emily henry of mine. but miles is for sure the best love interest she, or maybe any other contemporary author, has ever written. and i absolutely cannot wait to watch you all fall with both him, and daphne, and their amazing funny story.trigger + content warnings:drinking, smoking, a joke about suicide, brief mention of fetishization (to a side character and in a negative light), parental abandonment and neglect and and instability in past, child abuse in past, mention of loss of parents in past (side character), one sentence mention of cancer (side characters parent), anxiety depiction, and just a story about people going through a really hard break up that has a little bit of infidelity vibes (even though no cheating did occur to them)‚ô°evie'samazing spotify playlistblog|instagram|youtube|wishlist|spotify|amazon‚ô°Beach Read‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚ô°Happy Place‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to talk along the surface of things, but I also don‚Äôt want to unearth the ugly stuff, over and over again, for people who are just passing through my life.

This isThe Tortured Poet's Departmentcoded with elements ofMidnightsin the second half of the book. This book was everything I didn't know I needed and I'm going to need Emily to write more contemporary romance books immediately.‚Äî The romance is a heavier focus compared to some of her other work, however it still had Emily's character driven stories, witty humour and introspection. This will be very subjective depending on your own personal connection to these characters and stories but I felt so seen in this book. This was a personal experience for me as it always is with Emily's books and I found it emotional at times.‚û≥Daphneis up there with one of the most relatable FMC's for me. She's cynical about love and has been neglected by most people in her life. The romance was a large factor, but Daphne's fear of abandonment, parental issues and cynical nature gave me the emotional depth I crave in Emily's books. Daphne's abandonment issues are incredibly realistic and I got teary towards the end seeing how this has shaped her life.The Prophecyfrom TTPD this is so Daphne coded as she doesn't feel like she belongs anywhere with family, friends or relationships.‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt force a person to show up, but you can learn a lesson when they don‚Äôt. Trust people‚Äôs actions, not their words. Don‚Äôt love anyone who isn‚Äôt ready to love you back. Let go of the people who don‚Äôt hold on to you. Don‚Äôt wait on anyone who‚Äôs in no rush to get to you.‚Äù‚û≥Milesis portrayed as the well-liked and free-spirited personality, however, he has a depth to him once he opens up. He's very patient and in tune with the emotions of people around him. He's an optimist and I loved how he turned Daphne's pessimistic statement's into something positive. I love his personality and banter so I will forgive him for wearing crocs all the time ü´£‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy to be around people who don‚Äôt know you. But as soon as someone starts to figure you out‚Äîas soon as you can‚Äôt be perfect‚Äîit‚Äôs easier to move on. Find someone new to be the cool, fun, laid-back one with.‚Äù‚û≥PeterandPetraare terrible people. I found Peter especially triggering. He's the guy that always wants what he doesn't have and can't let others be happy without him. Petra got off too easy for her behaviour.‚û≥Ashleighis a side character but she offered a lot to this story. I loved thefound familyaspect she brought but also her own experiences also added depth to the story. I loved her moment with Daphne towards the end of the book which offered constructive feedback to Daphne's response to conflict.‚û≥The romancehad me kicking my feet like a love-struck teenager. They were so adorable and the chemistry and tension was palpable. The angst was on nearly every page and while the sexual tension was amazing, it wasn't instant love and their relationship offered so much more than sexual chemistry. They did trauma bond to an extent at the start but it's very clear that their chemistry was not a consequence of the hand they were dealt. This is very loosely fake dating ‚Äî It could had fallen into so many other tropes but I loved the direction Emily took and she really let the characters stand on their own.‚ÄúI want to kiss you, every time you take a sip of something and make that sound. I want to kiss you every time I walk past your bedroom and hear your laugh through the door. I want to kiss you every time I hear the shower turn on and know that you‚Äôre in there. I want to kiss you all the time, Daphne. Sometimes it‚Äôs just easier to find an excuse.‚Äù‚Äî There's a conflict towards the end and people might have some mixed feelings about it. I personally thought it was realistic because I related to the characters I would have felt the same. I don't pick Emily's books up with the expectation of it being a fluffy. I crave the introspection so I was not disappointed. It goes without saying that her writing is beautiful and witty ‚Äî she had me laughing, blushing and crying.

Every move counts nowadays. After the sport led to the destruction of her family four years earlier, Mallory's focus is on her mom, her sisters, and the dead-end job that keeps the lights on. That is, until she begrudgingly agrees to play in one last charity tournament and inadvertently wipes the board with notorious ""Kingkiller"" Nolan Sawyer: current world champion and reigning bad boy of chess.Nolan's loss to an unknown rook-ie shocks everyone‚Äîespecially Mallory. What's even more confusing? His desire to cross pawns again. What kind of gambit is Nolan playing? The smart move would be to walk away. Resign. Game over. But Mallory's victory opens the door to sorely needed cash prizes and, despite everything, she can't help feeling drawn to the enigmatic strategist....As she rockets up the ranks, Mallory struggles to keep her family safely separated from the game that wrecked it in the first place. And as her love for the sport she so desperately wanted to hate begins to rekindle, Mallory quickly realizes that the games aren't only on the board, the spotlight is hotter than she imagined, and the competition can be fierce(-ly attractive. And intelligent...and infuriating...)","[{'rating': 1, 'content': ""I have a love-hate relationship with Ali Hazelwood's writing and please excuse me if this review gets a tad too expressive üòä I was really excited to read this but the whole experience was a massively disappointing one.It started off decent and interesting.I liked Mallory,her looking out for her family and siblings was something that resonated with me on some level. I liked her relationship with her sisters and how selflessly she gave for years and years. Sabrina and Darcy were okayish. I liked Sabrina better, as Darcy was all over the place. Look, I know it's not a fair comment given she's just 12 but am gonna tell you why she pissed me off, or rather Ali's writing pissed me off.I found the book after a 100 page mark to be boring and getting worse.Although I liked the chess elements and it was interesting enough to keep me reading, but I didn't sign up for chess alone. I thought I was promised romance too, on which I'll elaborate further.First, I'll come toNolan.Was he there in the book? Oh, he was? Where? Oh, he was the love interest. Was there a blossoming love? Oh, there was... Where? Basically, he was so basic, he is forgettable. He has the personality of a rock. The man has no expression. I couldn't care less if he had something to say or not, which mostly he does not. He just pouts, glances, glares and that's his day.The romance did not come across as romance,or even a budding one at that. Mallory and Nolan had minimal chemistry. They came across as colleagues throughout the book and nothing more. Their interactions were made to appear as something deep but it really wasn't.Coming to my not so favorite topic- Ali's writing.I know it's her first YA book but it came across as trying TOO hard. The overloading of unfunny jokes was just cringe worthy. The gen Z references were never ending. But the worst of all was how she wrote about sex.Now, I know this might be perceived as unpopular in today's world but YA does not need to have a lot of sex talk in it.Few sentences, one or two paragraphs talking about it in a mature and tasteful and educational manner is fine. But when the 12 year old character starts pestering the adults to talk about their sex life while talking about her adult sister's sex life to a man she just met, is just creepy, and sends a wrong message. Sure, teens talk about sex and make sex jokes- but amongst themselves. Not to some random guy they have just met!! Also, why is there so much sex talk in this book when the targeted audience is not NA.I might be a bit old school here but I stay firm in my position- LET YA BOOKS BE YA!!Authors must be cautious in how they deal with sex in this genre. You either fade to black, have a short but non descriptive- tasteful scene, or just let it be for an educational and learning purpose.Ali Hazelwood might have the talent to write but she did not have the substance to write.The decision to read this book is your own, but this one was not for me and in my view, there are much better books out there.~‚Ä¢~‚Ä¢~Now this one looks refreshing and promising.

It‚Äôll come up a lot. Like massive arms and massive hands, which is how you know he is packing a massive‚Ä¶rook to knight combo. That‚Äôs how chess works, right? I‚Äôm not really sure but that is what is so great aboutCheck & Matebecause even if you previously had no interest in chess this book is so charming and energetic about the game that you‚Äôll have a great time no matter what. I am absolute dog shit at chess‚Äîmy phone app has beaten me enough to accept this‚Äîbut I am delighted that Hazelwood said ‚Äúyou know what should be sexy?CHESS!‚Äù Hazelwood has made a name for herself with a wildly successful series of spicy adult novels featuring young women navigating fields typically gatekept by men and finding romance and here she enters the realm of YA where 18 year old Mallory returns to the world of chess, rusty from a long hiatus inflicted by shame and keeping her family afloat. Now she must face-off against misogynistic expectations and chess world champion slash thirst trap icon Nolan ‚ÄúI swear I‚Äôm not an Adam Driver Insert‚Äù Sawyer. The ‚ÄúKingkiller‚Äù. The man with the big, meaty, sexy hands (remember this). But also the man she embarrassed by defeating in her first match, making her the new, hot topic about Chess World. Hazelwood writes with bubbly wit and while the constant corporate branding name drops might make one wonder if this book is collecting ad revenue, it's a fresh and fun rom-com that deals with themes of teen parentification, friendship anxieties and being thrust into a judgemental spotlight where the personal life you can barely keep from falling apart is suddenly the topic of social media speculation.Check & Mateis as corny as it is horny but, honestly, it's also just a good time that knows its audience well.‚ÄòHis movements, when he touches the pieces, are precise, economical, strong. I hate myself for noticing that.‚ÄôGirl, trust me, we all noticed that. Anyways, I found the premise of this to be quite promising and it lives up to it. It‚Äôs almost interesting enough to uphold the reluctant rivals to lovers engine that drives the story. While most realistic-fiction YA tends towards a high school setting, it was refreshing to see this being set in chess tournaments and libraries (‚ÄòGod bless libraries.‚Äô Agreed). Part of the premise is that chess is now the Big Thing thanks to Tiktok and Sawyer, the bad boy of chess, for inspiring a lot of content around his looks and temper tantrums (Kylo Ren behavior‚Ä¶), which, sure, I could believe that happening in this post-The Queen‚Äôs Gambit-fame, social media influenced world. And the youth getting really into chess is a super cool idea, I‚Äôd love that to happen. It also helps raise the stakes in this book because chess matches are covered like they are the Super Bowl and the cash prize is enormous. And so are Sawyer‚Äôs arms.The financial opportunities are key to our gal Mal‚Äôs motivations, and shd has more or less vanished from her own life in order to raise her aggressively-tween sisters and care for her sick mother. Hazelwood presents the hardships of a parentified teen who feels cornered by her own life that has been bent towards constant service of others to the point that taking time for herself is guilt-inducing. But all of chess is cloaked in a sense of shame for her and she hadn‚Äôt played in years, though the reason behind this is something Hazelwood only teases until the big reveal late in the novel (though its so hinted at I doubt the reason will come as a surprise to anyone after the first 20 pages). Hazelwood captures being burnt out and frustrated well while also making detangling all her insecurities a coming-of-age narrative nestled into the overall plot.‚ÄòThere‚Äôs lots to consider. My feelings about chess, for one, which I cannot disentangle from my feelings for Dad. They are twisted, knotted together. There‚Äôs pain. Regret. Nostalgia. Guilt. Hate. Above all, there‚Äôs anger. So much anger inside me. Mountains of it, entire blasing landscapes without a single furyless corner in them.‚ÄôThe YA genre suits Hazelwood well, being able to turn on the firehose of emotions and make the more immature or quippy moments read as more age appropriate as it does in some of the adult novels Hazelwood often gets compared with. I enjoyed that the characters are older than most YA, being in that sort of anxiety-ridden purgatory between high school and ‚Äúbeing an adult‚Äù. A great example of this is Mallory‚Äôs friendship with Easton and the interplay of Mallory feeling FOMO as Easton goes off to college while Easton worries she is being similarly phased out due to Mallory‚Äôs rising-star adventures. While Hazelwood is known for being pretty spicy she tones it back a lot here to suit a YA audience in ways that never feel like self-censorship. There‚Äôs still a lot of waistband grabbing (those big, manly hands‚Ä¶) and brief steamy moments though its mostly fade-to-black. Perhaps the lack of sex in the book also helped focus on ensuring the plot held up and was engaging. Truthfully, I couldn‚Äôt put this down.Still, I liked these characters‚Äîthe dialog is fun and snarky without feeling like it needs toonlybe one-liners to the point of absurdity‚Äîand while Mal and Sawyer‚Äôs relationship sometimes seems to conveniently progress despite them really only talking about chess its all pretty cute. Sawyer‚Äôs character works well as an example of misconstrued perceptions on a person and behind the mystique he is actually quite a lovable person who treats Mallory well. He‚Äôs also possibly an Adam Driver-cast insert as both Driver and Star Wars get a call-out in text. This seems to be Hazelwood‚Äôs thing andThe Love Hypothesisbegan as Star Wars Reylo fanfiction in a STEM field and minus Kylo Ren‚Äôs penchant for war crimes. Plus we have the whole Mallory as a sort of ‚Äúchosen one‚Äù who defeats temper tantrum boy who has trained for years which isn‚Äôt NOT the plot ofForce Awakensif you squint at it. Though Sawyer‚Äôs grandfather and his mental health issues come up, thankfully he wasn‚Äôt notable for having committed a genocide. Have I mentioned that this guy is hulking?‚ÄòMost women in chess decide to skip these events and complete in women-only tournaments. I bet you‚Äôre wondering why.‚ÄôWhile Sawyer is supportive and sweet, the rest of the chess world is a minefield of misogyny for Mallory to navigate. Journalists love to ask her ‚Äòhow does it feel to be a women in chess?‚Äô and her first experience with Koch‚Äîessentially the villain of the book‚Äîis him asking if she beat Sawyer by dressing evocatively. Good on Hazelwood for addressing the extra pressures and judgment on a woman in male-coded fields while inspiring young women to embrace their hobbies and strengths and achieve in whatever they want to do. But also good on her for making Koch so fun to hate. I mean, this guy is basically some teenage Ben Shapiro character twiddling his evil mustache (okay Koch doesn‚Äôt have a mustache but you get the idea) and being insufferable to everyone. You‚Äôll want to punch him. A few times.There are a lot of complaints online about the use of slang and pop culture references here, which is whatever. Does it seem like a sort of eye rolling technique to be ‚Äúthis is how teens talk right?‚Äù, sure. But I do want to start a conspiracy theory that books will have product inserts as the new form of tv commercials because Hazelwood name-checks so many corporate brands and highly-specific product names that it feels weird. It‚Äôs like when the kid is sleep-talking brands inWhite Noiseand I kept joking that this book is generating ad revenue to keep the publishing industry rolling.After having read Colleen Hoover and Emily Henry this year, I figured I should complete the trifecta and read an Ali Hazelwood and I‚Äôm pretty glad I did. Overall, this was pretty fun. It moves at a quick pace (shocking for a story about chess games, I know) and has some pretty fun ups-and-downs while following a fairly formulaic romance plotline. Sure I could probably nitpick stuff about plot holes or whatever, but at the end of the day that seems beside the point to me. I‚Äôm judging this based on my rule I‚Äôve just now invented called theA Knights TaleRule: believability is beside the point when you came to laugh along to a story about Heath Ledger looking great on a horse. This is fun and cute and I had a pleasant time reading it. It also achieves its main goal: making chess seem sexy. So excuse me, I‚Äôm going to go get my ass kicked by my chess app again and pretend I‚Äôm Gary Kasparov playing against Deep Blue.3.5/5‚ÄúChess is a bad idea.‚Äù‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù‚ÄúLook where it got me.‚Äù‚ÄúIt got you here.

Though, if you are familiar with the pattern followed in Ali Hazelwood‚Äôs other books, you can probably guess the ‚Äútwist‚Äù that comes towards the end.The character dynamics among the MC‚Äôs family felt really interesting and made Mallory feel much more like a real person. It made me wish we had gotten more of the same with Sawyer‚Äôs found family outside of the interactions with Mallory so I could see him as more than an obscenely tall, love interest and chess machine.In case you are wondering if there is any variety in the character descriptions from her other books, I feel I should point out that Ms. Hazelwood remains consistent in her writing. Paraphrased examples: ‚ÄúHis hands are massive‚Äù and ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt miss him because he stands a head everyone else in the room‚ÄùI will likely continue to read her books because they‚Äôre fun, typically light reads, but I wish she would give us some diversity in her characters.

The destruction of chess destroyed her family for the worst. During a tournament, Mallory caught her father kissing another woman, meanwhile he had a family of his own. Since then, Mallory\'s father has unexpectedly passed away. After the sport of chess led to the destruction of her family four year earlier, Mallory\'s focus is now on her mom, her sisters, paying the bills, and her dead end job as a car mechanic to keep the lights on. Mallory is the oldest of three daughters, she plays surrogate mother as her mother is sick and can\'t really move, let alone take care of her other two daughters. Mallory\'s sister, Sabrina, drove me insane. Sabrina was totally ungrateful and only cared about herself. As Mallory was working her butt of trying to make ends meet, all Sabrina cared about was getting her derby bills paid. I couldn\'t help but cheer and love Mallory, I just wanted to reach into my kindle and give her the biggest hug ever, with no words. Mallory\'s main focus is on her mom and sisters, but that is until she begrudgingly agrees to play in one last charity tournament and wipes the board clean against Nolan Sawyer. Nolan is completely shocked that Mallory beat him, but he wants to keep playing her over and over again.Okay, how did Mallory and Nolan play a game for seven hours straight? The only thing I can do for seven hours is read and sleep. Nolan Sawyer is known as the ""Kingkiller"" of chess, currently the world champion and reigning bad boy of chess. Nolan is a tall, grumpy, and temperamental chess player on the outside, but on the inside he is a soft, sugary cinnamon roll. The only thing I had a issue with is that Ali Hazelwood would always talk about how tall Nolan was, like okay, I get it, Nolan is tall as fuck. Nolan was a sweetheart, he might be the bad boy of chess and the world champion, but he wanted to keep playing Mallory over and over to secretly help her become the best female chess player in the world. The things Nolan did for Mallory just warmed my heart so much.Cinnamon roll sweetheart, Nolan Sawyer, had my heart in a choke hold.I couldn\'t help but love Mallory and Nolan , they were just two precious souls. Nolan was very sarcastic and very blunt during press interviews, he was never afraid to speak what was on his mind. Despite Mallory being back in her chess world, she wants to keep her family out of it, but that\'s kind of hard when there\'s tabloids of Mallory and Nolan going around. Mallory and Nolan were just have a conversation, but people made the picture of them together go viral like Mallory and Nolan were dating.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '‚ÄúWhen I‚Äôm with you, Mallory, everything is different. When I‚Äôm with you, I want to play more than I want to win.‚ÄùIt feels like I\'ve been deceived by Ali and this book. My first anticipated read of this month and this book definitely wasn\'t what I expected. I was so excited to read it because it is written by Ali and she said it\'s anangsty rivals to lovers story in chess worldbut it was more about chess tournaments and chess championships than Mallory and Nolan and their rivals to lovers romance. The plot had so much potential but the execution of it was a bit off and unsatisfactory. How can you expect me to read 350 pages about the never ending chess tournaments and how FIDE and all the things worked in chess world. There was just too much info dumping about it.

I was so close to dnf this book because of these refrences. Honestly I never had any problem with Gen Z refrences in books but the way Ali tried to put these in almot every sentence and conversation between the characters made this book a bit cringe. My favourite things in this book were Nolan Sawyer, the romance part and Mallory\'s little sister Darcy. She was so adorably hilarious.‚ÄúWhy would you keep something that makes you think of me?‚Äù I feel him shrug.‚ÄúBecause I think of you anyway, Mallory.‚ÄùThe romance was cute and adorable.It was young love and even swoon-worthy but there wasn\'t much rivalry between Mallory and Nolan like the way Ali promoted it. There were some cute amd funny moments which I absolutely adored but I did not like the way Mallory treated him sometimes. The way Nolan cared for her and made sure she got the fellowship in chess was just so precious. He wanted to play chess with her and she denied him every single time and I understand her reasons but Nolan did everything he could to earn her trust. Nolan deserves so much better. Also I hated how he was more like a side character in this book than the""actual""side characters which is the worst that could happen to a mmc.He turns us around and then we‚Äôre on the unmade bed, the twisted sheets digging into my spine. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be playing the most beautiful chess I‚Äôve ever seen, and I dream about having you under me.

He is a perfect man.‚ÄúAre you real?‚Äù The air between us swells, overflows. ‚ÄúSometimes I‚Äôm scared that I imagined you. Sometimes I think you‚Äôre only in my head.‚Äù‚û∏ Mallory GreenleafThe oldest sibling in her family who had to take care of her two younger sisters and her mother so I\'m sure you know what I\'m trying to tell you about her here. She had family issues and mostly daddy issues and on top of that commitment issues and it took her years to finally talk about them with her family and stop hating herself for them. I didn\'t like her but I also feel like she never deserves any of the shit she went through for years.‚ÄúHe studies me for longer than is comfortable. Galaxies pass through his black eyes, and I wonder whether this second could last a century. Whether the universe could be just me and him, understanding each other on a forever loop.‚ÄùThe endingwas a""typical Ali Hazelwood ending""with a third act breakup over a misunderstanding which can be cleared by talking but as usual the Fmc is too tired, too betrayed to even listen what mmc have to say in his defense. But then she realises she made a mistake and goes back to the mmc. I already knew what was about to happen in the end.Overall this book was fine and even enjoyable sometimes. I liked how Ali tried to step out of her usual""women in stem""books and tried something different.

take my card and do what you want with it.however, i think everyone heard that ali decided to incorporate a dictionary of references that she thought were young, funny and cool (stop that, mom), invoking timothee chalamet\'s name more times than the main character\'s ginormous hands around that small tiny coffee mug. i kept thinking to myself that this would shred my reading to pieces, but you kind of get used to it (exposure therapy maybe? idk) and the story becomes engaging enough to make you forget that nolan is considered the sexiest boy of our generation and that there are several edits of him on tiktok - and it‚Äôs probably playing end game by taylor swift as a background audio.‚ãÜÔΩ°Ôæü‚òÅÔ∏éÔΩ°‚ãÜÔΩ° Ôæü‚òæ ÔæüÔΩ°‚ãÜ üéÄabout the charactersüéÄ ‚ãÜÔΩ°Ôæü‚òÅÔ∏éÔΩ°‚ãÜÔΩ° Ôæü‚òæ ÔæüÔΩ°‚ãÜmallory greenleaf. our main character. our chess prodigy that no longer plays. our child playing the mother role for herbrattysisters. our daughter with daddy issues and, therefore, commitment issues (go get that therapy, pet). mal is sweet, smart, funny, kind, hardworking and extremely down to earth - in another words, it‚Äôs a very hard and difficult task not to adore her and cheer for her throughout the book - which sometimes makes you want to smack her head on the table so hard that she would maybe stop being so dense and selfless -PLEASEfor once in your life be a spoiled, bitchy and ego centrical teenage girl that only thinks of herself (breathes in and out to calm herself down). once you get through that, her unconditional love for her family is, indeed, really admirable and cute, the things she gave up for them and the shitty jobs she took for them, all of her sacrifices will make your heart ache and break a little. and that‚Äôs the reason why we love to see her finding herself once again in chess - this is not a spoiler because it is painfully obvious that she will play again eventually - like it‚Äôs a chess book, someone has to play at some point, right? and about that, don‚Äôt be afraid of not understanding shit, ali actually makes a great job in this part - as she did with stem terms in her previous books.nolan sawyer. our second main character. our timothee chalametgoodbye, goodbye, goodbye, adam driver, you were bigger than the whole skyof chess. our supposedly moody and bad tempered privileged boy that is secretly (but not so secretly) mal‚Äôs great admirer (god bless his tormented soul). nolan is unapologetic himself, confident, smart, sarcastic, a bit closed off but, nonetheless, a great friend to his loved ones- and did i mention that he‚Äôs the tallest man ever with this huge hands? cause he is - just so you know. this poor boy has had it enough, he‚Äôs tired, he‚Äôs bored, he‚Äôs almost entering an existencial mid life crisis in his teenage years - like can you imagine being so intelligent and gifted that playing chess with other grandmasters (they‚Äôre like the cool and talented kids of chess) put‚Äôs you into a sleeping coma since their moves are so predictable to you.enters mallory. who manages to wipe the floor with him (her words, not mine) during a match. the boy is whipped and he knows it. - she rizzed him up with a checkmate, who knows.‚ãÜÔΩ°Ôæü‚òÅÔ∏éÔΩ°‚ãÜÔΩ° Ôæü‚òæ ÔæüÔΩ°‚ãÜ ‚ôüÔ∏èabout the romance‚ôüÔ∏è ‚ãÜÔΩ°Ôæü‚òÅÔ∏éÔΩ°‚ãÜÔΩ° Ôæü‚òæ ÔæüÔΩ°‚ãÜit‚Äôs cute. it‚Äôs sweet. it‚Äôs swoon worthy. it‚Äôs young love. it‚Äôs legs being kicked. it‚Äôs giggles being smothered. it‚Äôs cheeks being painted crimson and scarlet red. and it‚Äôs PG 13 - don‚Äôt you go crying and booing in my doorstep, now, please, because their interactions and affectionate moments and late night conversations and ‚Äúcan‚Äôt keep my hands/eyes to myself‚Äù are, indeed very lovable and heartwarming and - color me surprised - enough to make you love love love the romance. do we have a third act breakup? do we have a fall out? and does it happens in the last few pages? does she run away? can‚Äôt tell you that since,duh, spoilers, but what i‚Äôll say is that whatever happened in the end didn‚Äôt bother me and it was actually necessary for mal‚Äôs growth - so there you have it, my little spoiler munchkin.‚ãÜÔΩ°Ôæü‚òÅÔ∏éÔΩ°‚ãÜÔΩ° Ôæü‚òæ ÔæüÔΩ°‚ãÜ üéÄabout my final thoughtsüéÄ ‚ãÜÔΩ°Ôæü‚òÅÔ∏éÔΩ°‚ãÜÔΩ° Ôæü‚òæ ÔæüÔΩ°‚ãÜas you know, it was a four stars rating for me (clap your hands and make noise) since i truly loved and enjoyed it every second of it (there were some moments though that his hands wer- never mind i got distracted) and devoured the book like i haven‚Äôt been fed in ages - almost like a small victorian child going through the bubonic plague in the mid 1300s, but it was just me in a reading slump.but, maya, the references were so annoying and uncalled for - someone whined in the crowd(plot twist: it was me whining), now, don‚Äôt you worry my child, like i said in the beginning, you really get used to it and start to brush it off eventually, promise you (and cross my heart). and i think it‚Äôs pretty obvious that i‚Äôll be recommending this gorgeous book to my lovely gals out here, but just for the ones that tend to enjoy this cutesy type of book, the ones that love wes bennett you know - if youonlylike dark romance, this shit is not for you, bub, however, if you go both ways, then you should definitely give it a shot, it‚Äôs no‚Äùi‚Äôm-going-to-make-your-life-miserable-and-spit-on-you-and-humillate-you-but-you-must-know-that-i-love-you-secretly‚Äù(which i vouch for, as a matter of fact, and am very into it also - will always love you darius) but more of a‚Äúi-know-that-i‚Äôm-staring-at-you-like-i-hate-you-but-in-reality-i-love-everything-you-do‚Äùkind of thing.noand who tf is the girl with the ‚Äúi heart rome‚Äù shirt talking to mal in the end?

However I feel like i didn't reallyknowthem, but got illuded to trauma both had.sadly, i wish i enjoyed this more, the more i think about it the more i dislike it so im going to stop here. i'll keep my happy memories. ali ill be back for the next one ü´°previous reviewanyways here is my message to Ali Hazelwood on book ideas she could use while still staying in the relm of science.number one: two reaserches that arebest friends(shocker right they are not eniemes that have a missunderstanding) are reaserching nuclear fusion lets say (because we just had a big advancement in that how exciting üòç) okay and get this the two friends both have feelings for each other but hide it to protect there friendship and through there reaserch they are around each other more and so it becomes harder to repress there feelings and suddenly one of them lets slip and they get together, all slowburn so no need for misscommuniaction or anything, you havesmut, science, AND slowburn. throw that alliteration in too and your english teacher will be as happy as a clam.numer two: instead of enemies lets haveacademic rivals, the begruding respect but wanting to be better the tensionüòç oh its so perfect, and lets say they are in collage/university (whatever you call it) and lets have them be in a really hard degree like mathematics or enginering or biochemistry. And they both have academic validation so theyNEEDto get top scores and be at the top of the class and its one or the other one week is him then its her ugh iconic. THEN they get paired up together for an assessment that is like half there grade and its SUPER important and so they have to work together on a engineering project/mathmatical problem/ biochemistry reaserch paper. and slowly they get to know eachother more than just this person i need to beat and they fall in love, and while in that relationship they still have that respectful rivaly and banter we all lovenumber three: something like the love on the brain where they are in a company building setting where a bunch of different academics are creating something amazing and groubdbreaking in science, the two main characters are two completly different people, one a biologist that looks at the evolution of animals and why creatures adapted due to enviromental changes. and a mechanical engineer, the biologist (lets make him a man because hey! lets break these gender norms) and hes there to help with something idk yet this is an idea not a story dont judge me im a humble reviewer, and the womans the mechanical engineer thats there to bring the entire thing to life. they are opposites in everyway, hes all nature and the evolution of life and shes the numbers, but it works somehow they get close and together. i dont know not my best idea but i like the number three so we are running with it.why not add in more than science? sprinkle some computor coders, they deserve a love story because coding is hard, add some teachnology, people discovering ai, mathematics is always fun (said no one but me ever) that would always be so fun to look at.and while your at it add in some queer rep madetwo women in stem fall in love, now that would be iconic. üíÖoh and in all of them please no galexy leggins, unicorn socks or cat hoodies please our main character is meant to be smart and sophisticated not a crazy millenial cat lady she has more important things to be doing like discovering so many new things. üí™üí™as a women in science i love what you are doing, but honestly, i think you have the ability, skill and popularity to go above and beyond with your message.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'i have a feeling; imma love this book..‚Äî‚Äîokay, I think she understood the assignment. THIS COVER IS GORGEOUS !'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '‚ÄúGod bless libraries.‚ÄùI haven\'t been to a library in so long because the closest one is so far, and it makes me so sad because I love them üò≠Anyways, this is my second Ali Hazelwood book, the first being The Love Hypothesis, which I adored. I really want to read Love, Theoretically, but I haven\'t gotten around to it, but I will someday. I am honestly pretty disappointed in this, since I\'ve been expecting this book since it first was announced, and since the cover was first revealed, and I was so excited!But alasÔΩ°Ôæü‚Ä¢‚îà‡≠®‚ô°‡≠ß‚îà‚Ä¢ ÔΩ°ÔæüPlotI\'m usually pretty good at reading contemporaries or romances because the plot is super easy to follow, and that\'s exactly what this was.Except for all that chess lingo. I haven\'t played chess a day in my life, and I never intend to after learning what I have in this book. The game can go on for over six hours?? That\'s not happening, I think I\'ll stick to my little checkers board thank you very much.Anyways, back to the plot, I thought it was nice and simple, and great for a quick read.Now, my complaint is the fact that sometimes, authors write YA as if it\'s a middle grade novel. This book borders on the edge of YA and New adult or adult, because while it\'s advertised as YA, and the main character is 18, some of the jokes and scenes weren\'t very YA-ish. The only thing that stopped it from being new adult was the fade to black scene. I don\'t really care, because I can\'t lie, I was disappointed when I found out this book was YA. It probably would\'ve been better if it was adult, because some of those stupid childish jokes would\'ve been cut out. I don\'t know why people think that YA is geared towards more childish jokes, YA is not only being read by children.Here are some examples! I\'m sorry.‚ÄúThis morning my roommate repeatedly farted on my pillow because I dared to ask her not to practice her xylophone at 5:30 am.‚Äùthis one legitimately made me close my eyes, close my book, and take a deep, long breath. Fart jokes became old in elementary school, and even then, I despised them.‚ÄúUnclench your butthole, Mallory.ÔøΩÔøΩshut up‚ÄúWhen he swallows, his throat bobs, a strong, mesmerizing movement that I notice because . . . I‚Äôm going bananapants?‚Äùactually shut upwelcome back to elementary school kids! I hope you have a FABULOUS VISITthere were too many fart jokes to count in one scene, and it made me want to walk all the way to the lake outside my house and chuck the book into it.and want to see one of the first sentences in the book?‚ÄúMrs. Agarwal is at her desk, pretending to grade papers but probably reading Bill Nye erotic fanfiction.‚Äùwell then !I will admit....some scenes made me laugh. The book did get better as it progressed, which is the reason it has 3 stars instead of 2 ‚ò∫Oh, and I know Ali Hazelwood gets talked about for always making her male characters huge and her female characters tiny, so I tallied out how many times Nolan was described in any way as ""big"" or big compared to the main character, and I have concluded that it was around 13. Take that information and do what you will.Also, there were so many pop culture references in this that it was crazy. TikTok was mentioned a few times, and I didn\'t really care, which was surprising, but it got annoying to an extent, and then Taylor Swift was mentioned, but of course I didn\'t mind that, have you seen the Taylor\'s Version in my name? There were a lot of other bands and modern stuff, and this is why I stick to fantasy, where none of this is ever mentioned üòå (I will admit, I liked the talk about Timoth√©e Chalamet, only because I had his statistics song stuck in my head.)do not get me started on the Percy Jackson reference, I\'m trying to wipe it from my memory please and THANK YOU. I don\'t remember it all, but there\'s some about reading erotic Percy Jackson fanfics and having him and someone sixty-nine. I\'m not ok at the moment, save Percy.I don\'t remember who he\'s doing that with, I\'d rather not know anyways‚Äúbecause when I asked myself if I had the right to those tears, the answer was always no, and it was easy to stop myself.‚Äùshut the hell upSorry if I run out of quotes halfway through the review, there\'s like none in the quotes section and I don\'t want to go back into the book.ÔΩ°Ôæü‚Ä¢‚îà‡≠®‚ô°‡≠ß‚îà‚Ä¢ ÔΩ°ÔæüThe CharactersI hated Mallory so much in the beginning of the book. She was getting on my nerves with her stupid attitude. I get that she was going through a lot, and I understand that, but she was so negative that even I, the queen of negativity, was flabbergasted. She believed the worst of everyone and everything, and it happened so often that I wanted to scream. Thankfully, she got better, like way better, and the end of the book. We love a good character development.Now Nolan\'s situation is complicated for me, because I\'deasilyfall in love with him, BUT, that is also the name of a close family member to me üòÉ so let me tell you, my inner conflict was going crazy during certain parts of the story, because I loved him as a character, I love the tall, dark, and handsomes, especially when they\'re mysterious and cold, but I just couldn\'t get past that his name was someone I was related to! For this reason, he will not be added to my list of book boyfriends.I really liked the side characters, and Oz was the best character hands down. When he told Mallory off, I was grinning so hard because he was just saying facts and putting that girl in her place, and it was so satisfying.SABRINA WAS A BITCH THOUGH. I don\'t care if she\'s fourteen years old and some fourteen year olds are bitches, but she was so rude, I couldn\'t stand it.‚ÄúI think about a deserted chessboard. Only the white king on it, standing on the home square. Alone, untethered, safe from threats. Free to roam.‚ÄùÔΩ°Ôæü‚Ä¢‚îà‡≠®‚ô°‡≠ß‚îà‚Ä¢ ÔΩ°ÔæüThe RomanceI will admit, I did find the romance quite cute. A tad unrealistic, a tad fast, but it\'d make me boring if I nit-picked based on just those two things, so I\'ll let it slide. The tension between them was pretty well created, and some of their scenes actually made me giggle, which is the best thing ever in a romance book.Of course, this book also came with the good ol\' second act drama. I think it was kind of a miscommunication, but Mallory also really overreacted, because based on her need for money at the time, I don\'t see why she would\'ve gotten upset, or maybe I\'m just not that kind of person üò≠I\'m also quite annoyed at the fact that we didn\'t get a solid reunion at the end. I had to read a ""two years later"" epilogue written in NEWSPAPER FORM. I DON\'T CARE I WANT TO SEE THEM INTERACTING AS AN ACTUAL COUPLE.ÔΩ°Ôæü‚Ä¢‚îà‡≠®‚ô°‡≠ß‚îà‚Ä¢ ÔΩ°Ôæüoverall, unless you love YA that\'s on the way way upper side of YA but also has a ton of elementary school jokes that will make you want to throw the book into a lake and has a main character that you want to throw in the lake with said book, I\'d recommend skipping on this one.save yourselfthis review made me angry, so I\'m deducting my rating to 2.5 stars2.5 starsInstead of putting a quote, I will be putting all of the pop culture references I found while flipping through again!

I think she did it well.Yes, there‚Äôs innumerable references to everything popular right now, but I don‚Äôt think anything actually made me cringe.The chess part of the plot (as someone who knows less than nothing about chess) wasinteresting. I may not have understood all the terminology (what IS the Gr√ºnfeld) but I got the gist of it.The actual plot itself felt very cozy to me. Not a lot happened, there were more thoughts and feelings than anything else, and it was just really sweet.Ali‚Äôs books always tend to be quick reads, but I almost didn‚Äôt want to put this down, and if I haven‚Äôt had things to do...I definitely would have finished it in just a few hours.The characters were quite easily my favourite part, even though Ididwant to slap a particular sister once or twice.Mallory, the protagonist, felt very relatable to me. Maybe it‚Äôs because we‚Äôre both the oldest sister, maybe it‚Äôs because she (like me) has the unfortunate habit of trying to do everything herself, but all I know is that I really enjoyed her perspective.The only thing that could have made this book better isNolanhaving a POV. Tall, sarcastic men who don‚Äôt know how to function in society are always my favourites, so it‚Äôs no surprise I loved him.Emil and Tanuwere good side characters, and (if a little annoying at times) quite sweet.AndOz? I lost count of the times he made me laugh, with his threats and general grouchiness.All together, they‚Äôre the cast for a book I can only describe asadorable.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîquotes‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄúWhy would you keep something that makes you think of me?‚Äù‚ÄúBecause I think of you anyway, Mallory.‚Äù‚ÄúHe told me once that sometimes, with some people, it's not about winning or losing, That with some people, it's just about playing. Though for the longest time, I didn't really believe him.‚Äù‚ÄúHe‚Äôs tireless, unshakable. Driven in an indomitable, near- obsessive way. This iron- hard tenacity of his is an oddly attractive quality.‚Äù‚ÄúI feel protected from attacks from all sides. Like the king during good chess.‚Äù‚ÄúEven the good ones, they don‚Äôt know how it feels.

Sin embargo,la autora tiene muy buena mano a la hora de plantear las tramas y puntos de vista, haciendo que la novela atrape y sorprendiendo aun utilizando clich√©s.EnSave Metenemos la historia de Ruby y James. Son dos polos opuestos. Se odian. Porque s√≠,este libro es unenemy-to-loversde manual.Y es una de las cosas que m√°s me ha gustado, sin duda. Adem√°s de que no es para nada un amor a primera vista y es bastante interesante ver c√≥mo se desarrolla su trama rom√°ntica, porque tiene puntos muy interesantes.Para mi sorpresa,el personaje de Ruby me ha encantado.Es bastante diferente a m√≠, porque es super organizada y se toma la vida demasiado en serio, pero siento que tiene bastantes m√°s capas y he podido conectar bastante bien con ella y el tema de la familia o la universidad. No s√© por qu√© exactamente, perome ha ca√≠do bastante en gracia y siento que va a tener un gran desarrollo en las siguientes entregas.¬°Porque tiene un par!

Es wurde zus√§tzlich zum Klischee braves M√§dchen und reicher Badboy noch versucht √úbergewicht, Sch√ºler-Lehrer-Beziehung, Homosexualit√§t und Drogen zu verarbeiten. Fand ich ja etwas viel des Guten aber nunja.Au√üerdem wurde ich aus vielen Sachen ehrlich gesagt einfach nicht schlau. Zum Beispiel hab ich Ruby nicht verstanden und konnte ihre Handlungen oft nicht nachvollziehen. Und wie naiv kann man bitte sein?! James fand ich hingegen einfach nur unsympathisch. Fand die Erkl√§rungen f√ºr sein Verhalten auch nicht wirklich entschuldigend...Generell konnte ich die Entwicklung der ""Beziehung"" der beiden nicht nachvollziehen und es gab f√ºr mich auch einfach gar kein Prickeln zwischen den beiden.Einzig der Schreibstil hat mich bei der Stange gehalten. Das Ende war ja auch nix, aber ich f√ºrchte ich werde trotzdem lesen wie die Geschichte der beiden √ºber noch 2 B√§nde ausgeschlachtet wird.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Zuerst hatte ich nicht vor einen Kommentar zu diesem Buch zu schreiben, da ich gar nicht wusste wo ich anfangen sollte. Ich wei√ü es immer noch nicht, aber ich werde einfach mal beginnen. Es gibt schon genug mir unverst√§ndliche positive Reviews, warum hinterfr√§gt niemand etwas? Ich muss hier einfach mal ein Statement setzen und meine absoult ehrliche Meinung sagen. (Spoiler!!)Als erstes zu den Charakteren. Ich wei√ü immer noch nicht wer Ruby ist. Die Autorin wollte mich glauben machen, dass sie extrem klug, zielstrebig und rational ist. Und nat√ºrlich sch√ºchtern, ihr gro√ües Ziel ist ihr ihr ganzes Leben lang, entschuldige zumindest nur in Maxton Hall, unsichtbar zu sein. Ein sch√∂nes Lebensziel. Wenn man nach Oxford will, denke ich, ist es keine gute Strategie nicht aufzufallen und von niemandem gekannt zu werden.Aber ihr Vorsatz nicht aufzufallen hat sowieso nicht hingehauen, was ganz sicher nicht nur an James lag. Wann war sie bitte sch√ºchtern oder hat ein Blatt vor den Mund genommen? Nie. Sie flippt andauernd aus. Kann sich nicht beherrschen. Und hat sie ernsthaft melodramatisch diese Geldscheine in die Luft geworfen?*Facepalm* Und bei jeder Diskussion wurde sie sofort extrem pers√∂nlich. Was einfach nur peinlich, unprofessionel, kindisch und kein bisschen rational ist. Anscheinend hat sie seit sie James getroffen hat eine vollkommene Pers√∂nlichkeitsumwandlung durchgemacht. Von sch√ºchtern und rational zu temperamentvoll, direkt und emotional.Genug zu Ruby. Kommen wir zu James. Ich habe mir zuerst halb im Scherz gedacht: ""Wetten sein Vater schl√§gt ihn?"" Guess what. Sein Vater schl√§gt ihn wirklich. Okay, so weit so gut. Es wird nicht einmal erw√§hnt warum seine Mutter nicht f√ºr ihn einsteht? Bei dem einen Mal bei dem Ruby seine Mutter trifft, wird sie als starke Frau beschrieben. Ruby w√ºnscht sich zu sein wie sie. Was? Habe ich was verpasst? Sie ist doch intellektuell und will nach Oxford, abgesehen davon kennt sie seine Mutter nicht. Aber zur√ºck zu James. Dass sein Vater ihn schl√§gt gibt ihm keine Entschuldigung sich wie ein Idiot aufzuf√ºhren. NICHTS gibt ihm eine Entschuldigung sich so aufzuf√ºhren. Er ist ein typischer Bad Boy mit viel Geld, dem langweilig ist und der keinen Plan hat was er mit seinem Leben anstellen soll. Armer Junge.Kommen wir zur Handlung, bzw. zu ihrem gemeinsamen Drama denn aus etwas anderem besteht dieses Buch nicht. James hat Angst, dass Ruby seine Schwester verr√§t und will sie deswegen bestechen. Ruby weist ihn zweimal von sich und benimmt sich dumm und naiv. Ich wei√ü nicht wie ihre Handlungen als stark r√ºberkommen sollen. Er dem√ºtigt sie und benimmt sich wie ein arrogantes Arschloch, aber anscheinend fasziniert ihn etwas an ihr, weil sie ja anders als andere M√§dchen ist. Sie f√§hrt f√ºr die Schule mit ihm in seinem Rolls Royce plus gut aussehendem Chauffeur nach London und bildet sich anscheinend ein, dass zwischen ihnen etwas ist, weil er sie h√ºbsch genannt hat? Dann ist sie √ºberrascht dass er sich wieder fies verh√§lt und sie dem√ºtigt. DIESES VERHALTEN IST EINFACH NICHT OKAY. Warum beschreibt sie sich selbst sozusagen als h√§sslich und alle anderen als wundersch√∂n? Warum sind alle in diesem Buch wundersch√∂n? Das ist doch nicht normal.Sie verzeiht ihm aber droht ihm, dass sie sich das nicht nochmal gefallen l√§sst. Nat√ºrlich benimmt er sich wieder unvezeihlich und sie verzeiht ihm wieder. Das wird wohl noch einige Male in den n√§chsten B√ºchern passieren. Hat dieses M√§dchen keine Selbstachtung? Ich kann nicht erkennen, dass er irgendetwas f√ºr sie empfindet. Es kommt einfach ein Klischee nach dem anderen.Ich h√§tte dieses Buch vielleicht noch als 0815 abgetan, w√§re das Ende nicht gewesen. Das Ende hat mich wirklich aufgeregt. Dar√ºber konnte ich nicht mehr genervt die Augen verdrehen. Sie kommen zusammen und schlafen miteinander. (Was war das f√ºr eine unauthentische Sex-Szene? Ich dachte sie war noch Jungfrau?) Und dann stirbt seine Mutter. An einem Hirnschlag. Sie wurde √ºbrigens nur 2mal erw√§hnt. Die Autorin bringt einfach seine Mutter um und benutzt diesen sinnlosen Tod um ihm erneut eine Entschuldigung zu geben, auszuflippen, Drogen zu nehmen und seine neue Freundin zu betr√ºgen, die er ja so liebt? What the hell??? Es macht keinen Sinn. H√§tte er sich ver√§ndert und w√ºrde er sie wirklich lieben w√ºrde er so etwas einfach nicht machen.Falls sich jemand fragt wie die anderen Figuren waren. Sie waren quasi nicht existent. √úber ihre Schwester Ember bekomme ich eine Seite lang erz√§hlt wie toll sie ist und wie sehr sie zu k√§mpfen hatte, aber davon habe ich nicht das Geringste gemerkt. Eine Szene gab es in der Ruby fast ertrunken ist, wegen ihrem traumatischen Erlebnis. (Nat√ºrlich musste sie auch noch ein Trauma haben und einmal fast misshandelt werden.) Die Reaktion ihrer Schwester: ""Ohhh wie s√º√ü James BEAUFORT hat dich gerettet."" Wie bitte? Ihre ganze Familie ist ""perfekt"", obwohl Ruby ihnen nichts von ihrem Leben in der Schule erz√§hlt. Ihr ganzes Leben besteht aus Schule, √ºber was reden sie dann bittesehr??James ""Jungs"" kann ich immer noch nicht auseinander halten, weil sie alle gleich sind. Einer ist schwul und hat gedroht Ruby das Leben zur H√∂lle zu machen, wenn sie es jemandem erz√§hlt. (Warum findet sie aus Versehen die Geheimnisse von allen heraus?) Ein anderer hat sie einmal fast misshandelt und ein anderer hat sie in den Pool geworfen und sie ist deswegen fast ertrunken. Dieser Typ hat sich nichtmal bei ihr entschuldigt.Abschlie√üend m√∂chte ich sagen, dass dieses Buch nicht nur aus langweiligen Klischees besteht, die vielleicht noch ganz lustig w√§ren. Nein, der Tod seiner Mutter, als Rechtfertigung f√ºr sein Verhalten war wirklich unterste Klasse f√ºr mich. Dar√ºber kann ich nicht hinwegsehen. Nein. Das einzig Positive waren die Meetings des Organisationsteams und die Beschreibungen von Oxford.Die n√§chsten B√§nde werde ich ganz offensichtlich nicht mehr lesen.Edit:Ich m√∂chte auch erw√§hnen, dass ich die Autorin sehr symphatisch finde und sogar ihren Geschmack in B√ºchern teile. Aber diese Tatsache √§ndert nichts daran, was ich von ihren B√ºchern halte.Ihr Schreibstil war extrem simpel, wesewegen man schnell durch das Buch kommt. Aber manche Vergleiche waren einfach nur cringy. *Augen verdreh*'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'PHENOMENAL. SHOW STOPPING. GROUNDBREAKING. EARTHSHATTERING. BRILLIANT. ASTRONOMICAL. STRIKING.

He still treats her terribly though.The crux of what makes this book shockingly bad is the author‚Äôs failure to decide, or possibly even distinguish, between writing either a realistic portrayal of teenage sexuality or a junior version of an angsty billionaire romance. The problem is not that we have two extremely emotionally immature leads in a superficial relationship - James runs hot and cold and pretends not to know uptight Ruby when his obnoxious friends are around - because obviously that is not an unknown dynamic, and could be a worthwhile subject for a serious and sensitive YA novel. The problem is that this awful not-quite-relationship is portrayed as deeply romantic and meaningful.Plenty of other self-hating misogynistic tropes from women‚Äôs fiction make it into the book.- Ruby is a girl not like all those other girls, who want James for his money and degrade themselves by gawking at him. Ruby is above such things, at one point rejecting a staggering bribe he offers her(1) and thus winning his interest.- James‚Äô supposedly romantic gestures are almost entirely correlated with being wealthy - he gives her lifts in his family‚Äôs chauffeur driven limousine, he takes her to a party in an opulent mansion, he gives her an expensive bag (made by his family‚Äôs business) and he loans her a priceless dress from his family‚Äôs collection(2). We are told (certainly not shown) that he has scintillating discussions about current affairs with her, but the only actually romantic thing he does that doesn‚Äôt consist of being filthy rich is rescue her from drowning in a pool and carrying her off in his muscular arms, Ruby conveniently having a phobia (3) that has made her physically helpless to save herself.- Ruby is a priggish judgemental virgin and that makes her a worthy heroine. All the other girls James has slept with are worthless sluts who deserve being emotionally irrelevant to him.- We are told Ruby is smart because she works very hard and fetishises timetables and organisation; James on the other hand coasts by on natural intellect and in the first meeting of her precious events committee effortlessly comes up with better and more creative ideas than her. We are assured the pair have off-stage conversations and that they are really deep and intelligent, but Ruby can't muster an intelligent insight in her POV to save herself. James, despite being emotionally damaged and constantly behaving like a ****wit, is a lot more self-aware.- Probably worst of all, in a sub-plot involving a teacher sleeping with one of Ruby‚Äôs classmates in an affair that began when she was 15(4), it becomes apparent the author really is suggesting that the student is somehow the seductress. Because this occurred in a YA book written in the 21st Century I kept on waiting for some understanding that the teacher is acting immorally; instead, we find out this is real love and has rescued the girl from sleeping around.In terms of gender relations the whole novel is old school reactionary brain-rot.There‚Äôs plenty more to rant about. The author apparently has no idea how education or the class system works in England. The physical model for Maxton Hall is apparently Fettes College, ie. a school that is actually in Scotland, which may explain why this most prestigious secondary school in England is co-ed and has a rector rather than a principal. That is a quibble, but in not understanding that English schools are not quite the same as Scottish schools, the author shows her lack of understanding of her setting(5).When it comes to the cultural life of the school, Kasten is apparently drawing from deliberately heightened US high school dramas, where the students are ostentatiously wealthy, democratically fashionable, throw elaborate parties on campus, drive cars to school, and of course are co-educational day students. She has the ‚Äúrector‚Äù of a posh English school require his students to organise parties for their teenage classmates, random alumni and parents, at which alcohol is served and drunkenness amongst the students overlooked to the point of tacit encouragement. Yes, English culture is pretty tolerant of surreptitious youth drinking but I can‚Äôt imagine a school, let alone the most famous and prestigious school in England, forcing children into an official situation practically designed to embarrass them in front of adults and encourage harassment. And then as part of a prank, strippers come to the school‚Ä¶ yes, someone hires strippers who coerce a minor into a lap dance because apparently in this world the strippers' booking agency didn‚Äôt bat an eyelid at a request to go a high school, they weren‚Äôt phased by their audience being suspiciously young once they got there, and they aren‚Äôt afraid of harassing clearly unwilling underage participants. You get the picture. Almost everything that happens in this book is completely ridiculous which might be fun if the book wasn‚Äôt also practically humourless and convinced of the timeless depth of the central romance.There are some positive things to say, beyond that it made a wonderful book club book because there was so much to pick at. There are many potentially interesting minor characters and sub-plots that don‚Äôt get much airing here but might be developed in the sequels. The characterisation of Ruby and James could be interesting in a book that wasn‚Äôt invested in them as romantic heroes. The first few chapters are substantially better written than the rest; the chapter introducing Ruby‚Äôs family has some particularly lovely scene-setting. I don‚Äôt know what pressures meant the author couldn‚Äôt sustain that level of writing. It‚Äôs quite possible she wrote a more commercially successful book by abandoning a better one.(1)James, a child whose only source of money is his obnoxious and controlling parents, has apparently ready access to a sum greater than the average annual UK income to bribe his fellow students with. Even billionaires might blink about letting their kids run around with enough cash to buy a sports car stuffed in their pockets.(2)Ruby wears this precious 150 year old dress to a school party, after it is altered to fit her. ****ing barbarians.(3)Realistic characters have phobias and vulnerabilities, and I would be fine with a phobia plot line if we were reading a realist YA novel. This particular vulnerability however, feels very much as though it was constructed to leave Ruby a helpless damsel in need of rescue.(4)Yes, that is below the legal age of consent in the UK. It is a crime for teachers to sleep with students under 18 in any case.(5)I don‚Äôt expect a ton of research in a piece of fluff, but I think the author has no feel for her setting at all. The thing that really confirmed this was the section where James and Ruby go for their Oxford interviews, because the author clearly had researched this bit, probably even visited Oxford and crammed in copious tedious details of the process and buildings, while still getting the flavour completely wrong. For example, there are many lovely historic pubs in Oxford of great historical significance such as the one that plays a role in the book. However the Oxford colleges would never organise official beer-heavy admissions events in them, because they are tiny and divided into tiny little rooms, because most of the students invited would be still 17 and not legally allowed to purchase beer, and because they aren‚Äôt sadists who are trying to get a lot of nervous kids sloshed before some of the most important interviews of their lives.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Dass ich diesem Buch mehr als 2 Sterne gebe, grenzt eigentlich an ein Wunder.

I watched the first episode and while in the book some things, especially aspects of the romance and the timeline, felt undeveloped, the show made me comprehend Ruby and James‚Äôs motives more. The romance itself (bookwise now) definitely has some moments, that make you want to giggle and kick your feet. Overall, I felt for the characters and wanted their dreams to come true. The story itself is very wattpad-y, but has some elements that make it stand out from similar stories. I really like the main character Ruby and her urge to organize and plan everything. She has too little flaws to make her realistic though. Generally, I wish the author would have given her characters more depth and more bonding with another. I despise some of James‚Äôs friends and I‚Äôm interested in how they‚Äôre gonna be portrayed in the sequel and whether they‚Äôre going to redeem themselves.

Eigentlich w√§ren es eher 1,5 Sterne, aber ich fand viele Ans√§tze, die sie hatte, wirklich, wirklich gut und deswegen bleibt es bei zwei Sternen.Nachdem ich bei Mona Kastens erstem Buch ""Begin Again"" bereits nach 17 Seiten aufh√∂rte zu lesen, war ich dieses Mal deutlich optimistischer, sobald ich reingelesen hatte. Der Stil l√§sst sich sehr angenehm lesen und man kommt flott voran, ohne irgendwo gro√ü h√§ngen zu bleiben. Einzig die Wortwahl war zwischendurch etwas plumb und es war mir ein bisschen zu viel Telling und zu wenig Showing. Damit konnte ich oftmals √ºberhaupt nichts empfinden beim Lesen und war oft eher genervt als mitgerissen, wenn es zu dramatischen oder gar traurigen Szenen kam.Insgesamt war die Handlung des Buches nicht unbedingt voraussehbar f√ºr mich, was jetzt nicht positiv zu werten ist. Ich hab an vielen Stellen eine Entwicklung der Figuren erwartet, die dann so nicht stattgefunden hat, womit ich oft das Gef√ºhl hatte, es w√ºrde emotional nicht vorangehen, dabei ist handlungstechnisch einiges passiert.Die Hauptfiguren James und Ruby waren f√ºr mich zu Beginn der Geschichte noch interessant, jedoch wurden sie mit der Zeit nur noch unauthentisch, furchtbar (entschuldigt den Ausdruck) nervt√∂tend und einfach hohl. Ruby, die ich deutlich mehr mochte als James, h√§tte viel Potenzial gehabt, als Figur viel aus sich zu machen, hat mir jedoch an vielen Stellen, wo es unn√∂tig war, zu viel Drama gemacht, ist total ausgeflippt und ist dann in ihre Ecke heulen gegangen, statt irgendwann mal die Fassung zu bewahren. Sie hatte sich NIE unter Kontrolle, hat James st√§ndig Szenen vor anderen Leuten gemacht und sich furchtbar l√§cherlich aufgef√ºhrt, womit sie im Laufe des Buches extrem Minuspunkte gesammelt hat und f√ºr mich wie ein schlecht entwickelter OC einer Fanfiction wirkte.Genauso James. Ich hab ihn in der ganzen Geschichte nie gemocht, meistens fand ich ihn langweilig und w√§hrend er √∂fter mal wie der Broken Guy wirken sollte, fand ich die Darstellung seines Problems plumb, langweilig und konnte √ºberhaupt nichts von dem nachempfinden. Dabei w√§re hier deutliches Potenzial gewesen. Aus meiner Sicht ging es auch zu wenig um sein Problem des ""Ich hab ja nichts in meinem Leben zu entscheiden"", daf√ºr dass es am Ende so wichtig wurde und offenbar so eine tragende Rolle spielt. Meistens war James langweilig oder ein Arsch, der dann im Veranstaltungskomitee DIE Ideen hatte, dabei hat er das NIE gemacht und sie w√§ren NIE ohne ihn darauf gekommen.Er hat im Laufe der Handlung manchmal den Eindruck erweckt, er k√∂nnte sich nicht nur Ruby gegen√ºber sondern generell entwickeln, jedoch wurde dies immer wieder zunichte gemacht. Besonders das Ende war absolut unlogisch aus Figurensicht und - aus meiner Sicht - sehr, sehr schlecht.Daf√ºr muss ich hier loben, dass Mona Kasten bei vielen Nebenfiguren tolle Ans√§tze hatte. Figuren wie Ember oder Alistair fand ich zum Beispiel 1000x interessanter als die Hauptfiguren James und Ruby und war dementsprechend traurig, dass sie sp√§ter √ºberhaupt keine Rolle mehr spielten oder schlecht eingebaut wurden. Besonders James\' Freunde, die ich interessant fand und die ebenfalls sehr viel Potenzial f√ºr mehr gehabt haben, waren sp√§ter unwichtig und zeigten auch keine Entwicklung. Sie haben sich √ºberhaupt nicht f√ºr James interessiert oder f√ºr seine Probleme, sondern nur f√ºr ihren eigenen Shit, womit ich unverst√§ndlich blieb, warum sie √ºberhaupt befreundet waren?! Besonders bei Alistair, der als sein ""bester"" Freund bezeichnet wurde, war ich ehr entt√§uscht, aber auch weil ich die Figur mochte.Ember fand ich interessant, auch die Idee, hier mal etwas anderes einzubringen, sehr gut. Leider war es zum Teil ungl√ºcklich gemacht, da man wohl verschiedene K√∂rperformen darstellen wollte, trotzdem aber S√§tze benutzte wie ""F√ºr ihr Gewicht, trug sie diese und jene Kleidung trotzdem"" oder ""Obwohl sie diese und jene K√∂rperform hatte, war sie selbstbewusst"" (in diesem Sinne waren die S√§tze ungef√§hr). F√ºr jemanden, der sich in Ember wiederfinden wollte, wird das nicht so toll gewesen sein.Ich fand es den Ansatz super, dass Rubys Vater im Rollstuhl sitzt und auch dass Lin nicht die typisch wei√üe Amerikanerin ist.Sehr schlechte Nebenfiguren und daraus resultierende schlechte Handlungsstr√§nge waren James\' Eltern, die einfach unglaubw√ºrdig waren. Besonders sein Vater und James ""Angst"" (oder was das war) war absolut nicht nachvollziehbar, da sein Vater ihn praktisch nie interessiert hat bei allem, was er getan hat, au√üer wenn er gerade ums Eckchen schauen k√∂nnte. Die ganze Handlung um das Beaufort-Unternehmen wurde nur eingebaut, wenn es bequem war, sonst war es egal, genauso James\' Eltern. Das Ende mit seiner Mutter fand ich absolut furchtbar und sinnlos, nur damit noch ein Drama eingebaut wurde, das auch √ºbertrieben wirkte, WEIL die Eltern eben nie eine Rolle spielten, James\' Mutter noch weniger als sein Vater.Lydia, als seine Schwester, hingegen mochte ich recht gern. Insgesamt war jedoch auch das bei ihr eingebaute Drama unn√∂tig, regelrecht seifenoperartig und wirklich, wirklich entt√§uschend, daf√ºr, dass die Figur eigentlich gar nicht √ºbel war.Insgesamt w√§re zu vermerken, dass ich das Buch wirklich gerne gemocht h√§tte, aber das Ende und das, was aus den Figuren gemacht wurde, mich derart frustriert und w√ºtend macht, dass ich es nicht m√∂gen kann und nicht mehr m√∂chte. Das finde ich schade, weil - wie gesagt - gute, wirklich gute Ans√§tze und an vielen Stellen ungenutztes Potenzial.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'NOTA REAL: 4.25/5‚≠êÔ∏èNuestra protagonista es Ruby, una joven de 17 a√±os que desde bien peque√±ita ha so√±ado con estudiar en la universidad de Oxford. Siempre se ha centrado y esforzado al m√°ximo por cumplir ese sue√±o. Me ha ENCANTADO la personalidad de esta chica, ¬øpuede ser m√°s genial?Por ello, a pesar de su humilde estatus social, asiste a la mayor escuela privada de inglaterra, Maxton Hall. Aunque no se parece en nada a los alumnos que hay all√≠ (pijos ricos y sin escr√∫pulos, hijos de millonarios la mayor√≠a) y no comparte sus ideales, est√° dispuesta a aguantarlos con tal de conseguir de esta manera una plaza en su universidad de ensue√±o.Pero como ya os he dicho, no todo ser√° sencillo con los j√≥venes de Maxton Hall.Ruby descubre un gran secreto, y se ver√° amenazada para que no abra la boca en varias ocasiones.James, el hermano de la implicada en el secreto que Ruby descubre,intentar√° acallarlacon un cuantioso soborno, pero ella, indignada, rechaza su dinero intentando convencerlo de que no dir√° nada y que solo quiere olvidarlo.PeroJames y su familia tienen mucho que perder si ese secreto sale a la luz. No se f√≠a de su silencio y se convertir√° en su sombrapara asegurarse de que no se lo cuenta a nadie; lo cual afectar√° sobre manera a la misi√≥n de Ruby: pasar lo m√°s desapercibida posible (porque que te siga todo el d√≠a uno de los chicos m√°s importantes del instituto perteneciente a una de las familias m√°s poderosas de inglaterra, no ayuda demasiado a pasar inadvertida).Este libro forma parte de una trilog√≠a; el segundo se publica en junio y el tercero en octubre.¬øQu√© hago yo con mi vida los pr√≥ximos seis meses con semejante final?Quiero matar a varios personajes. Tal cual.Lo primero de todo: aunque ten√≠a muchas ganas de leerlo (por que parec√≠a el t√≠pico libro que engancha, no puedes soltar, y era lo que necesitaba) mis expectativas en esta historia no eran demasiado altas (neutras vamos a decir). Y lo cierto es que hasta la p√°gina 130 aproximadamente estaba de acuerdo con esas expectativas; a partir de ah√≠ todo cambio. Aunque hasta ese momento el libro ya me estaba gustando y era totalmente el tipo de historia que estaba buscando, desde ese instantemi opini√≥n del libro empez√≥ a elevarse considerablemente.POR CIERTO. Est√° narrado desde el punto de vista de ambos personajes, cosa que ya sab√©is que me encanta.Una cosa que quiero destacar queme ha encantado ha sido el desarrollo y la evoluci√≥n de los personajes. Algo que yo imaginaba impensable (o al menos que sucediera de manera cre√≠ble), pas√≥, y no lo vi para nada forzado, sorprendentemente üò≥Todo sucede a su tiempo, no ocurre nada precipitado;y eso para m√≠ hace que gane muchos puntos.No he le√≠do la otra serie de la autora, AGAIN, porque hab√≠a o√≠do que ten√≠a muchas escenas de sexo expl√≠citas y a m√≠ no me gusta leerlas (a mis 24 tacos). Pero al ver en la web de la editorial que catalogaban esta trilog√≠a como apta para lectores a partir de 14 a√±os, imagine que no seria como los de Again (y supongo que es as√≠, pero como no los he le√≠do tampoco puedo deciros). La cosa es que cuando me lleg√≥ el libro, me asust√© un poco porque ven√≠a con un folleto que entre otras cosas dec√≠a""esta nueva serie contar√° con m√°s sexo y drogas que la serie Again a petici√≥n de los lectores""(?)y yo me pregunto... si este libro tiene sexo y drogas (que solo tiene UNA escena) ¬ørealmente cu√°nto tiene la de Again que tanto han dicho? ü§£Porque en Save Me 1, apenas.En resumen, una historiacon alg√∫n que otro clich√© pero muy bien llevada, adictiva, f√°cil de leer, atrapante, entretenida, √°gil y con mucho salseo;que te deja con muchas ganas de m√°s, de leer m√°s y de matar m√°s tambi√©n ü§£Como tengas tiempo perfectamente puedes leerte este libro en un d√≠a a pesar de sus 400 p√°ginas.Como dato,el final me estruj√≥, arranc√≥ y pisote√≥ mi coraz√≥n, destruy√©ndolo en mil pedazos. No por el resultado principalmente, si no m√°s bien por el motivo. Quiero el segundo ya. Gracias'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Monas Schreibstil ist toll, deshalb habe ich mich auch nach den Again B√ºchern an die Maxton Hall Reihe gemacht.Die Story ist auch gut, kommt aber, in meinen Augen, nicht an die letzten beiden Again B√ºcher ran. Und ich habe etwas gebraucht um reinzukommen.Ruby ist s√º√ü und man muss sie einfach gern haben, genauso wie ihre ungew√∂hnliche aber liebevolle Familie.James dagegen ist der Klischee-beladene Star der Privatschule. Ich mag ihn und Ruby erkennt auch schnell, dass doch mehr hinter der gl√§nzenden Fassade steckt. Auch wenn er immer wieder was dummes macht...Das langsame N√§herkommen der beiden ist authentisch und gef√§llt mir und ich mag auch das ganze Drama.Am Ende hat mich die Geschichte dann auch emotional gepackt und nach dem Cliffhanger bin ich jetzt froh, dass ich alle drei Teile habe und weiter machen kann, mega gespannt auf den 2. Teil.'}]"

The Midnight Library
",Matt Haig,3.99,2023247,8329,"Fiction, Fantasy, Audiobook, Contemporary, Magical Realism, Science Fiction, Mental Health",288,13-08-2020,"Between life and death there is a library.When Nora Seed finds herself in the Midnight Library, she has a chance to make things right. Up until now, her life has been full of misery and regret. She feels she has let everyone down, including herself. But things are about to change.The books in the Midnight Library enable Nora to live as if she had done things differently. With the help of an old friend, she can now undo every one of her regrets as she tries to work out her perfect life. But things aren't always what she imagined they'd be, and soon her choices place the library and herself in extreme danger.Before time runs out, she must answer the ultimate question: what is the best way to live?","[{'rating': 2, 'content': 'I liked this book until it suddenly decided to moonlight as a self-help manual, replete with messages that would look great and profound on an Instagram post next to a well-posed cup of coffee with those foam pictures on top. Or embroidered on a pillow ‚Äî pick your poison.‚ÄúShe realised that she hadn‚Äôt tried to end her life because she was miserable, but because she had managed to convince herself that there was no way out of her misery.‚ÄùAnd these messages have the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Forget the readers figuring it out for themselves ‚Äî no, the moral and the take-home points will be (didactically) in your face, loud and clear, even if it‚Äôs awkward and clunky and stops narration in its tracks. Case in point:‚ÄúAs she switched to freestyle she realised it wasn‚Äôt her fault that her parents had never been able to love her the way parents were meant to: without condition.‚ÄùSome of these platitudes would also feel right at home in the Hallmark holiday special movie:‚ÄúAnd ‚Ä¶ and the thing is ‚Ä¶ the thing is ‚Ä¶ what we consider to be the most successful route for us to take, actually isn‚Äôt. Because too often our view of success is about some external bullshit idea of achievement ‚Äì an Olympic medal, the ideal husband, a good salary. And we have all these metrics that we try and reach. When really success isn‚Äôt something you measure, and life isn‚Äôt a race you can win.‚ÄùAnd I‚Äôm just not big on self-help or motivational books. I find most of them cheesy and corny and really awkward and often so painfully earnest that I just can‚Äôt take them seriously. It‚Äôs just me - I guess I don‚Äôt have the right personality to appreciate them. And so I was not too happy with the turn the story took.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîThe premise was interesting, and the beginning actually had me captivated. It‚Äôs a story of a woman who‚Äôs had her final straw - a whole bunch of final straws, really - and when gripped by the oppressive darkness of depression decides to commit suicide.‚ÄúMaybe she was just really crap at it. At life.‚Äù‚ÄúShe wanted to have a purpose, something to give her a reason to exist. But she had nothing.‚ÄùThis may be why so many of even middle-aged people like reading Young Adult books ‚Äî there‚Äôs something quite comforting about seeing a brand-new person, right at the cusp of adulthood, when all the possibilities are still there and no clocks have yet started ticking, and there is enough time and energy to regroup and move on to the road not yet taken. But Nora is thirty-five, an age considered way too late (especially for women, with that damn idea of a biological clock) to not have it all figured out. It‚Äôs not the time (at least for women) when the world is considered to be your oyster ‚Äîit‚Äôs the time when you really are expected to have your shit together. And Nora most certainly does not.‚ÄúWell, don‚Äôt hang about. Tick-tock tick-tock‚Äù,says a well-meaning stranger in that unasked-for-but-nonetheless-given bit of advice.‚ÄúWhen she thought about it ‚Äì and increasingly she had been thinking about it ‚Äì Nora was only able to think of herself in terms of the things she wasn‚Äôt. The things she hadn‚Äôt been able to become. And there really were quite a lot of things she hadn‚Äôt become.‚ÄùIn that moment between life and death Nora finds herself in a library full of books that are the alternate lives she could have had ‚Äî lives that would have stemmed from one different choice, one different decision. (Jo Walton‚Äôs quiet gemMy Real Childrenhad a similar premise, and it was wonderful). And the point is - once Nora finds a perfect life for herself in this endless tapestry of parallel and ‚Äúperpendicular‚Äù lives, she can choose to stay in it and live it as her own.The logical place to start is to revisit all those regrets that weigh her down. And Nora has quite a few of those.‚ÄúBetween life and death there is a library,‚Äô she said. ‚ÄòAnd within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices ‚Ä¶ Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?‚ÄùAnd then, after a great beginning (which was not always easy to read given how well Haig was able to capture the snowballing depressing crap happening to Nora)we careen right into the didactic self-help book where each parallel life exists to teach Nora a lesson that sooner or later will be unambiguously spelled out so that we don‚Äôt get it wrong.‚ÄúShe realised, in that moment, that she was capable of a lot more than she had known.‚ÄùAnd if you had any doubts about the ending, doubt no more. It ends exactly like anyone would have predicted at the beginning of that self-help turn, exceptit‚Äôs even more unrealistically saccharine than I even dared to anticipate. It takes a turn into that meaningless ‚Äúlet you be you‚Äù drivel that seems to say so much while actually saying very little. It becomes the cotton candy of advice - sweet but of little value.‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt need a vineyard or a Californian sunset to be happy. She didn‚Äôt even need a large house and the perfect family. She just needed potential. And she was nothing if not potential. She wondered why she had never seen it before.‚ÄùAnd all that relentless hammering of the ‚Äúprofound‚Äù message into to readers‚Äô psyche interspersed with tired cliches makes the whole book eventually seem bland and repetitive and tedious and, honestly, a bit trite.‚ÄúI mean, it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can‚Äôt have one without the other.‚Äù2.5 stars.

I add nothing. I am wallowing in self-pity.""No truer words have been said by Nora, the world\'s largest wet blanket. Woe is her, folks.Nora ends up at the Midnight Library, a place between life and death, because she doesn\'t want to live anymore. The library is full of books, each representing a life she could\'ve had had she made different choices. Now she has a chance to undo all her regrets (of which there are many) and try out all the lives she\'s missed out on, to see if there\'s another one she would\'ve liked better.Lest you think I\'m a cold-hearted reader for not loving this, I mean, sure that does sound like me. I count coins in my bathtub, chase children off my lawn with my gnarly walking stick, and club seals for laughs at least once a day, if not more. So what\'s to like? No no, I\'m just kidding. Really.Normally I love sappy, cheesy, inspirational mush. I watch Hallmark movies. I believe in soulmates and happily ever after. I cry during every sweet scene in every movie. And yet this book left me so cold inside, I got absolutely zero feels unless you count frustration as a feel.For one thing, this story doesn\'t come across as fiction so much as self-help disguised as fiction. The lessons to be learned in here are pretty obvious right from the beginning, yet they are presented like some sort of epiphany that can only be discerned if explained slowly and repeatedly. We are forced to endure these same lessons over and over every time Nora goes back to the library. Either Nora is the most dim witted of characters, or the author thinks us readers are.Another problem is that it\'s really hard to connect with Nora. She\'ll take any situation, suck every ounce of joy out of it, and interpret what\'s left in the most negative way possible. She\'s full of regret for every decision she\'s ever made, and thinks the grass is always greener. However, other than being negative, she literally has no other personality traits. She\'s a blank slate, dull and uninteresting.I also have issues with the core messages in this book. Nora finally learns her lesson, but it\'s only after having fixated on each regret, remade every decision, and lived all subsequent lives. Like come on, at some point, you just have to be okay with who you are and the decisions you\'ve made without knowing every single possible outcome.But my biggest issue is that I\'m really uncomfortable with this book\'s implication that if you\'re depressed, you only need to change your mindset and you will feel better. That goes against everything we understand about mental illness, including that it\'s important to seek professional help, that it can be chemically based, and that it\'s not a matter of not trying hard enough.We already have enough trouble as a society getting depression and mental illness taken seriously, without a ""feelgood"" book coming along and implying that you need nothing more than an attitude adjustment to cure it. That puts the blame squarely where it doesn\'t belong, on the hundreds of millions of people who are suffering from depression. But it isn\'t just the layman who harbors such misunderstandings. It also includes people who work in the mental health field, and even some therapists and psychiatrists. So you can understand my dismay at the continued popularity of this book, which further perpetrates this extremely toxic point of view.Please don\'t get me wrong. The message in here about having a positive attitude is a good one, and I\'m all for it. But that worthwhile message slowly but surely got overshadowed by the implication that depression is nothing more than a mindset, and that\'s where I fall off the bandwagon. At times, I\'m left wondering if the author started with the intention of the former and, over the course of writing this story, it somehow got away from him and he ended up with the latter instead.Obviously many readers loved this book, as evidenced by its overwhelmingly favorable reviews. But it\'s decidedly not for me. This is the second book I\'ve read by Matt Haig, and I\'ve pretty much hated both. So I think it\'s time I part ways with this author and just accept that we\'re not compatible.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:How to Stop Time~~~~~~~~~~~~‚úßConnect with me‚úßInstagram‚úß'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""‚ÄúThe only way to learn is to live‚ÄùFuck, this book hit me so hard. I finished this book a few days ago and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. It has one of my favorite themes or tropes in a book, where we follow a main character who at the beginning of the story is very depressed and possible suicidal and doesn't see the point of life, but then slowly throughout the story begins to build an admiration toward humanity and life. This book was so beautifully written and I love the way this book asks the question: what is the best way to live?‚ÄúBetween life and death there is a library, and within that library, the shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices‚Ä¶ Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?‚ÄùIt's a really cool concept, that between life and death you enter the midnight library, where you get the opportunity to see how your life would've been different had you made different decisions. I think a lot about this, what my life would be like had I made different choices and wondering if I'm the happiest version of myself? This book forces you to ask hard questions, like what makes a life worth living? And are your dreams for yourself really something you want? I love the way this book talks about regrets and how most of the time our regrets are a load of bullshit of things that are out of our control and they are causing a major burden on our life.‚ÄúA person was like a city. You couldn't let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole. There may be bits you don't like, a few dodgy side streets and suburbs, but the good stuff makes it worth-while.‚ÄùMatt Haig is such a talented writer and there are so many passages and quotes I'm obsessed with in this book. Much like The Humans (one of my all time favorites) this book has you questioning what the point of life is and thinking how truly absurd life can be. But I feel like this book is much more serious than The Humans, there are trigger warnings for depression and suicidal thoughts in this book, and it was very very heavy on my heart to read this book, where as The Humans feels a lot more light-hearted and hilarious.‚ÄúIt is easy to mourn the lives we aren't living. Easy to wish we'd developed other other talents, said yes to different offers. Easy to wish we'd worked harder, loved better, handled our finances more astutely, been more popular, stayed in the band, gone to Australia, said yes to the coffee or done more bloody yoga. It takes no effort to miss the friends we didn't make and the work we didn't do the people we didn't do and the people we didn't marry and the children we didn't have. It is not difficult to see yourself through the lens of other people, and to wish you were all the different kaleidoscopic versions of you they wanted you to be. It is easy to regret, and keep regretting, ad infinitum, until our time runs out. But it is not lives we regret not living that are the real problem. It is the regret itself. It's the regret that makes us shrivel and wither and feel like our own and other people's worst enemy. We can't tell if any of those other versions would of been better or worse. Those lives are happening, it is true, but you are happening as well, and that is the happening we have to focus on.‚ÄùBut god damn, I loved this book. I cried a lot at the end. I'll be thinking about this book for a long time. I also filmed a reading vlog and I included this book, you can see that here:https://youtu.be/9NiJtrbogyo""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""Everybody probably knows the premise of this book by now (I mean this book iseverywhere): a library with an infinite number of books. The books of regret. You open one and it transfers you to the life where you didn‚Äôt make that particular regret. Was it marrying someone or traveling or maybe other little things.While I admit I don‚Äôt actively pursue parallel universes kind of books on one hand, and on the other, the main reason why I read this book is that I was choosing the best fiction this year (to vote in the GR awards), I was actually looking forward to it. Most of my friends on GR gave it 5 glowing stars. A book beloved by the majority... I had a high chance of enjoying it. Sadly, I didn‚Äôt.First, it was boring. I listened to the audiobook and the narrator wasn‚Äôt the best, honestly. Not that her voice was annoying but it was kind of monotone. It certainly didn‚Äôt help either that I was listening toEleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fineat the same time, in which the narrator was so animated reading the book.I also found all of Nora‚Äôs revelations and enlightenment typical. Like sure I already know that. The ending was also painfully predictable from the start. So when you can guess where the book is going, everything in between becomes not so interesting anymore, especially if you don‚Äôt care about the main character. Unfortunately, I found Nora dull. She wasn‚Äôt interesting as the main character and I couldn‚Äôt relate nor care about her and empathise with her story. I can‚Äôt believe she was this multitalented in fields that aren‚Äôt related whatsoever to each other. She could‚Äôve been an athlete, a scholar or a musician. All successful. All are based on life decisions. I also think that she had the privilege of choosing such different options. Many don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt mean by that the book of regrets but rather focusing on a particular career path from the start. For example, many parents don‚Äôt nurture their children‚Äôs interests like music or gymnastics for several reasons maybe they can‚Äôt afford it or they just don‚Äôt care. But Nora had so many options.Luckily, the book was short. I also didn‚Äôt hate anything about it, hence the 2-star rating. But at the same time, I can‚Äôt name anything I liked. Maybe one of the lives, in particular, was more intriguing than the rest because of the two characters we met and.. the concept. It didn‚Äôt help that the book got repetitive sometimes. The premise was much more promising than the book itself. The ‚Äúmessage‚Äù was also pretty plain obvious. Yet many likedThe Midnight Library, however. So it might be more of a ‚Äúme and not you‚Äù kind of book.But let me tell you this: if you don‚Äôt find the parallel universes interesting to read about in stories, don‚Äôt read this novel. Don‚Äôt be fooled with ‚ÄúLIBRARY. MIDNIGHT LIBRARY. BOOOOOKS.‚Äù The library is just more of a metaphor. Most of the events in this book take place in the real world. And unless you‚Äôre interested in kind of self-help books (or motivational ones), don‚Äôt read this novel either. Because it‚Äôs more about what Nora discovered about herself and life, of course, by dealing with/trying to escape from her regrets.But then again, themajorityliked this book so you might too and it's simply notmycup of tea.Yet, itwasa dreadfully boring.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'So, first of all, HUGE thank you to goodreads for featuring my kindle highlights and notes for this book - wow.I never would\'ve expected such an amazing opportunity to share my love for this book NOR would I have expected to ""meet"" so many wonderful people through the comments.It\'s been so much fun and I\'m definitely doing more highlights/notes soon!!The Written ReviewLife has just gotten to the point where it\'soverwhelming and all-encompassingand above all, Nora can\'t see a possible situation where it gets better.Everyone she\'s ever known has pulled away, her job is gone and her best friend in the world passes.All she\'s left with is herself and acripplingly black hole.She slips herself a few too many pills and then drifts...andfinds herself in a library.Not just any library though, the Midnight Library.Guided by a person who may (or may not) be Mrs. Elm (young Nora\'s favorite teacher), Nora begins to take a look at the shelves.And every book is her.

His acute observations and experience of his condition informs this exquisite, inspiring, compassionate and empathetic novel where he creates the concept of the midnight library, to be found in the spaces between life and death, to explore life, the issues that afflict our world, through philosophy and more, endeavouring to tease out what might make life worth living and a joy and what gives it meaning. The device used to implement his goal is the ordinary Nora Seed, who has lived her life trying to please others, who has hit rock bottom, suffering the loss of her cat, her job, overwhelmed by the burden of a lifetime of regrets, seeing no light in her life whatsoever. She is tempted by thoughts of suicide that has her ending up at the midnight library.The midnight library is magical, for a start, the library has a limitless number of books, and these books are far from ordinary, Haig sprinkles gold dust in each book, offering Nora the opportunity to see how her life would have turned out if each and every decision at every point in her life had been different. The books illustrate the endless possibilities that life holds for Nora and all of us. Nora explores each book, with inquisitiveness and curiosity, the widely disparate lives that could have been hers, no easy task as she has to slip into each new life with the complications of being unfamiliar with it and do so without alerting the other people present. It soon becomes clear that there are pros and cons to each book/life, to each decision and choice made, each life containing its own mix of despair, pain and regrets that must be accommodated and handled.Haig offers a touching narrative that speaks of the joys to be found in living, attained through Nora's eyes as she tries to untangle what really matters in life, putting life in context and perspective with all its ongoing changes, complexities, and an understanding no life is perfect in itself. In some ways, this is a version of It's A Wonderful Life, a favourite film for so many people. What I was so struck by is just how many readers might find this helpful for our lock down times, so many have suffered unbearable losses and illness, have had to face not seeing all those we love and mean so much to us, whilst being weighed down with worries and concerns about how to cope with fears regarding jobs, childcare, money and more.

Or is it the case that depression is a consequence of environment, one‚Äôs less than sane immediate family perhaps; or possibly genetics, an historical aberration passed down from family far distant in space and time? Is the world an objectively depressing place; or made so by our attitude towards it? The philosopher Schopenhauer thought depression was an heroic human condition and promoted it by writing about it; Freud thought it was an illness and tried to cure it by talking about it.Haig thinks depression has something to do with regrets, that is, thoughts about what might have been if we had done things differently. And perhaps he has a point. In his view, regrets occur because of alternative histories we fabricate for ourselves in which disappointment with one‚Äôs lot is reduced or eliminated because life would be more fulfilling/successful/happy than the life one actually has. Depression, in other words, is a literary phenomenon. It‚Äôs a result of the what-if stories. Imaginative, articulate people, therefore, would be particularly susceptible to the condition. There is in fact substantial anecdotal evidence that this might be so (see, for example,https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...)Based on this essentially linguistic theory of depression, Haig has a suggestion for therapy. At this point he crosses the line from playful fictional speculation to a less than savoury quackery worthy of Ayn Rand and Tim LaHaye. Haig thinks that some down-to-earth horror stories are just the thing to augment the happily-ever-after alternatives in our heads. Re-write the script, he implies, picking up all the tiny contra-indications of bliss because‚Äúundoing regrets was really a way of making wishes come true.‚ÄùOr just remember that people, jobs, relationships, and desires change. Perhaps what was the case about these things when the alternative history was written hadn‚Äôt persisted. Or the outcomes remain the same despite different choices. Haig‚Äôs point, I suppose, is that things could be worse; that maybe Leibniz had it right: this world could be the best of all possible worlds. Disappointment with one‚Äôs regrets as a cure for regrets, and therefore a therapy for disabling, suicidal depression?Things could be worse!? That‚Äôs your therapeutic message? Are you serious, Matt?Haig even makes a pitch for a sort of group therapy in which those formulating alternatives to the alternatives get together for solace and encouragement. And of course he feels compelled to bring in quantum mechanics to bolster the non-literary reality of simultaneous lives - a clich√© I was mightily hoping he might avoid. And the allusion to YHWH as the master of ceremonies (very Leibnizian), in the guise of a benevolent librarian, keeping all the disparate quantum selves in line is pretty cheesy. Ultimately Haig opts for the cheesiest of all criterion for the story one must have about one‚Äôs life: authenticity, we must be our realest, bestest, truest self.‚ÄúAim to be the truest version of you,‚Äùthe godly librarian suggests, as if a depressive has a choice in the matter. I think Haig may have been to one too many EST seminars, or at least spent too much time in Southern California reading Heidegger on the beach.Of course in creating these new personal stories another issue eventually arises if oneÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩs authentic self is the depressed wreck one started with. Then‚ÄúIt is quite a revelation to discover that the place you wanted to escape to is the exact same place you escaped from,‚Äùsays Haig‚Äôs protagonist, brought back from the brink of suicidal death. But the important point, according to Haig, is‚ÄúYou just had to never give up on the idea that there would be a life somewhere that could be enjoyed.‚ÄùCan one help thinking of Eric Idle‚Äôs magnificent rendition of ‚ÄòAlways Look On The Bright Side Of Life‚Äô in theLife Of Brian? Did I mention cheesy.I think it clear thatThe Midnight Libraryis a grave insult to those suffering from depression. It is a facile, trivial, misdirected, and (did I mention?) cheesy book. Am I entirely off-base in thinking Haig wrote it as a feel-good piece for those who just need a little pat on the back for their recovery from a bout of the blues, or a failed love affair?

As Nora was to discover, we all ""fear life"" to some degree - we learn pretty young that actions can have pretty painful consequences.Some of us stare that fear in the face and do what frightens us anyway. Many more of us, however, will step back and opt to take the safer road. I loved the notion of Nora being able to insert herself in a parallel timeline and see how her life would have been like had she taken a chance on all of those potentially life changing events. The whole parallel universe notion was so tantalizing! Imagine if you, too, could examine and then finally burn your own Book of Regrets and just move on with living your best life now?The first third of this novel is heavily mired in depression. If you\'ve never felt stuck or depressed, you will certainly get a clue of what it feels like after you\'ve read or listened to those first few chapters leading up to Nora\'s attempted suicide. There was a history of depression in Nora\'s mother\'s family. I was not surprised that Nora fell into depression after taking care of her mother during her long, protracted illness. Death has a way of stopping the clock for the survivors and making them examine the value of their own life. I suspect there will be many who will identify with most of what Nora thinks and says in this novel.Nora\'s Midnight Library is guarded and managed by her beloved childhood mentor and high school librarian, Mrs. Elm. There are several chapters devoted to Mrs. Elm\'s struggle to get Nora to try to experience one of the parallel lives in her Midnight library. This reflects the very real battle that a person with depression must face to get to the point where they can finally admit that they need help to get ""unstuck."" Matt Haig has given a whole new meaning to the word ""potential."" I totally agreed with Nora\'s final decision at the end of the book. In fact, I saw it coming even before she had completed her first journey. We can\'t live someone else\'s life. The choice must truly be our own if we want any abiding sense of fulfillment.This author - this book - has a lot to teach us.

Happy Reading:)'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'It feels likeThrone of Glasshas been a book I\'ve been thinking about maybe reading for a million years. The reviews and ratings from my GR friends on this book are very mixed and I can easily see why after finishing this entertaining but disappointingly tame and romance-y young adult fantasy.Throne of Glassis likeShadow and Boneround two. The premise is awesome for both: full of hardcore warriors/assassins, royal/noble secrets and scandals, a touch of magic... but each one, though entertaining, quickly hangs up its weapons and becomes far more concerned with dresses, bitchiness and whether or not that sexy dude thinks the MC is hot (he does).This book is to the fantasy genre whatTwilightis to vampires; though I have to stress that it is a fast-paced, compelling read and Maas does tame fantasy as well as it can be done. Despite my frequent eyerolls and disappointment at the romantic turn the story took, the pages seemed to fly by. I tend to read several books at once; I\'ll spend a few chapters with one and then mix it up by moving on to another, butThrone of Glassmanaged to hold my attention from start to finish with no time for interference from another book. This, in itself, was quite an achievement.Celaena Sardothien is the star of this show. A former assassin turned prisoner, she spends every day in the salt mines prison of Endovier. Having given up on hoping for freedom, she wishes only for death. That is, until one day The Crown Prince (Dorian) and his Captain of the Guard (Chaol) arrive with a proposition for her - fight in a competition, win, become the King\'s Champion for four years, and finally earn her freedom. It\'s an offer Celaena can\'t refuse. But, of course, things aren\'t that simple. Some dark evil is at work inside the King\'s castle; something that is killing off the competitors one by one. Plus, there\'s the handsome Prince and moody Captain to deal with too.I don\'t think Celaena is in the King\'s palace for a day before she starts obsessing over her looks, her new dresses and whether or not either or both of the aforementioned men find her attractive. She still manages to have more badassery than Alina inShadow and Boneand the book is, in my opinion, nowhere near as boring asGrave Mercy. But, still, I couldn\'t help being like ""BUT you said ASSASSIN!"" when she\'s there swanning around in front of the mirror. I like that she\'s ""feminine"" (whatever you want to take that to mean) as well as a brutal killer, but there\'s only so much high school changing rooms behaviour I can take. I think there\'s an excellent quote, a question that Celaena wonders to herself, that basically sums up what was running through my head for a lot of this novel:""How had she gone from the most feared prisoner in Endovier to this sappy mess?""How, indeed. But, that being said, I really enjoyed the banter between her and Chaol. And Dorian wasn\'t bad either. I\'ve said it before but I\'ll say it again for the benefit of this review: I actually don\'t mind love triangles when they\'re convincing and both candidates for the MC\'s heart are on equal footing so there\'s some tension over who they\'re going to end up with. Though I may have to do all kinds of evil things - like... stomping around my bedroom angrily or letting library books become overdue - if Celaena doesn\'t end up with Chaol. Ms Maas, you\'ve been warned.So, yes, I will be readingCrown of Midnight, god help me. I\'m hoping it will please me more than the sequel toShadow and Bonedid, but the ending of this does make me think the second book could have more action and nastiness (yes!). I think you can enjoy this book if you go into it knowing exactly what you\'re letting yourself in for. It isn\'t high fantasy. It isn\'t mind-blowing. But it is kinda fun *grins*'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Madre m√≠a, ¬øpor qu√© no he le√≠do esto antes?Por fin, y despu√©s de casi diez a√±os, me he puesto manos a la obra con el primer libro de la sagaTrono de Cristalde Sarah J Maas. ¬øMe arrepiento de no haberla comenzado antes? Rotundamente s√≠. Qu√© pedazo pistoletazo de salida para una obra tan grande, y qu√© de sorpresas me he llevado‚Ä¶ Venga, vamos por partes.En l√≠neas generales,considero queTrono de Cristaltiene un buen ritmo.No recae demasiado en descripciones pesadas, porque si lo hace es usualmente importante en alg√∫n momento m√°s adelante. Hay unmuy buen equilibrio entre la duraci√≥n de los cap√≠tulos, las escenas, los di√°logos, momentos de introspecci√≥n de los personajes y momentos de acci√≥n.Creo que est√° todo cuadrado al dedillo y hace que te sumerjas en la historia sin ninguna complicaci√≥n.Celaena es un PEDAZO DE PERSONAJE.Enamorado de ella desde el primer momento, en serio. No solo es decidida y se la sudan completamente cosas como la monarqu√≠a, sino que es despiadada, sangrienta, extremadamente inteligente y curiosa, y la mejor asesina del reino.Es brutal.Sin embargo, tambi√©n tiene su corazoncito, y ese punto de inflexi√≥n en su personalidad me ha terminado de encandilar.Personajes como Nehemia, Dorian o Chaol construyen un universo alrededor de Calaena que me fascina.Cada uno de ellos est√° muy bien definido, conectas con ellos, sus emociones y sentimientos, y creo que todos aportan algo a la trama de una manera u otra.Quiz√° he echado de menos m√°s personajes como Nox, es decir, campeones de la competici√≥n con los que Calaena se acercara, pero lo que aportan personajes como Nehemia creo que lo compensa de sobra.El estilo de Maas no es nuevo para m√≠. Ya hab√≠a le√≠doUna corte de rosas y espinas.En este caso, sin embargo, me ha entrado m√°s f√°cil por los ojos. No s√© si es porque es su primera novela, pero no creo que sea tan rimbombante como lo es en ACOTAR. Va m√°s al grano, perono deja en ning√∫n momento de escribir con esa pluma tan caracter√≠stica de la fantas√≠a √©pica(con esto me refiero desde a uso del lenguaje a estructura concretas). Todo un acierto. La misma historia escrita de otra forma no me habr√≠a gustado tanto.Respecto a la historia...DAMN GURL!No me esperaba para d√≥nde iba a ir la novela. Me encanta todo el tema de persona elegida que va a una competici√≥n a destacar, que es un tropo o clich√© bastante visto. Sin embargo, los momentos donde se comienza a incluir magia o historia ancestral del universo donde se desarrolla la historia...Gloria bendita.Menuda sorpresa.Se me eriza el pelo pens√°ndolo, porque no me esperaba para nada que la historia realmente tratara sobre eso y que se vaya a dirigir hacia ah√≠.S√© que esto es tan solo una introducci√≥n, pero estoy deseando ver hasta d√≥nde puede llegar, porque de momento estoy fascinado.Creo quela autora presenta los elementos necesarios para comenzar a dibujar un imaginario sobre el universo creado,desde la magia hasta criaturas o leyendas antiguas, dinast√≠as mon√°rquicas y casas, relaciones de poder, estratos sociales o incluso econom√≠a y pol√≠tica. Plantea todo de una forma sencilla, f√°cil de captar, para desarrollarlo m√°s profundamente en las siguientes entregas.Agradezco que no entre a trapo con esas cosas y que se centre m√°s de momento en el personaje principal y los secundarios,porque creo que una historia sin buenos personajes, pues chica, me da igual. As√≠ quewell done.Y bueno,el tri√°ngulo amoroso...Mira,nome ha disgustado. ¬°Para mi sorpresa lo he disfrutado! Creo que las din√°micas no solo entre Calaena con los chicos, sino entre ellos mismos est√°n muy bien pensadas y contadas.Todo es justificado y creo que Maas no peca de enamoramientos a primera vista o cosas extra√±as que podemos ver en otras novelas juveniles del estilo.Las relaciones y romances parecen surgir con delicadeza pero de forma natural, y es algo que he agradecido enormemente. Deseando estoy -al igual que con la magia- de ver c√≥mo se desarrolla.En definitiva,Trono de Cristalme parece una espectacular manera de comenzar una saga de fantas√≠a tan extensa como esta.Me ha sorprendido y superado mis expectativas. De hecho, cerr√© el libro y de seguido abr√≠Corona de Medianoche,la continuaci√≥n.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""4.45/5 ‚≠êFull review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolfüê∫I am an occasional liar. I don't lie often, but when I do lie, trust me, I might pass as a lie-detector scammer, don't test me, I'm ruthless. But in general, I prefer to be brutally honest and direct. That's my true nature.Today, I could've easily lied and said that I've wanted to read this book,Throne of Glassby Sarah J. Maas, for as long as I remember, but I‚Äôve chosen to tell the truth instead: two months before actually reading it I‚Äôve heard about this book and it didn‚Äôt appeal to me, mostly because of the cover somehow?? I know, I am a hypocrite (don‚Äôt judge a book by its cover, remember?), but the cover itself has (in my opinion) a crucial role in my own personal pick of a reading. And this particular cover felt like it wanted to intimidate me so bad.I actually tried to readThrone of Glassonce before, earlier in the year, and I managed to stop after preciselytwo words, change my mind and read something else. I don‚Äôt know what got into me then, but I dropped it like it‚Äôs hot, really.But boy was I wrong because I actually enjoyed it and it was VERY readable.I can‚Äôt say that I particularlylovedany of the characters, at least at the beginning. They all seemed to be so stereotypical that I quit trying to bother: the narcissistic prince, the oppressed heroine with a shady background, the wicked king scared of magic, the hard-core right hand of the narcissistic prince, the misogynistic brute etc., etc. But as the plot developed, I started liking this hard-core gorilla bodyguard with the name of Chaol, this narcissistic prince with a flirty nature, but with a real love for knowledge, this oppressed heroine which made a name for herself, but preferred to use it just to cover herself because that was a choice she could make.To be completely honest, the most beautiful relationship of them all is the one between Celaena and Princess Nehemia of Eyllwe. Their friendship is so pure and so natural that it seems like their souls have been friends since the moment the world was created. If I‚Äôd had to truly ship someone, I‚Äôd ship them both, because, let‚Äôs be real, they are, on their own, passionate, dedicated and strong women, but together, they make the perfect team. As I heard some lady in a bus saying once: ‚ÄúUs women are stronger when we stick together‚Äù and yes, it is so true and so accurate for Celaena‚Äôs and Nehemia‚Äôs situation too.There are two important things about a book:it has to teach you somethingandit has to help you escape your own reality. I don't know about you, people, but I read books in order to escape my own cruel reality (because that is the reality ‚Äì a cruel and devious lifetime lasting wake-up call) and I recently discovered that fantasy books are the best remedy for an ordinary life. There is another life to live in a fantastic story, whenever the presented world is amazingly constructed and erected before our mind‚Äôs eye.To claim that and also deep, 7-D characters with some serious wisdom passages attached to the neatly done plotline is totally just a whole load ofbull, if you‚Äôd pardon my fluent French.I, for instance, do not judge a book by the lack of one of those aspects, but I judge it by the way it makes me feel and by how wholesome it is as an entity (and by its cover, of course!). This is maybe why almost every time I find something positive that I liked in a book that contributes to my general opinion about it. And this is also the case for this one!As the plot develops, the storyline becomes more and more intriguing until it reaches a point where things turn out dark and fantastic. What seemed to me at the beginning asokay-ishturned out to be, towards the end, a great, imaginative story. I am beyond happy that I was wrong! (That means the book is good because I rarely am wrong and I even rarely admit that Iwaswrong!).Celaena Sardothien, world‚Äôs best assassin, proves everyone that, after all, no matter how hard life beats us down, we must raise our head high up and keep fighting, because we all are beaten down by Life, but not all of us show this the same way:‚ÄúWe all bear scars, Dorian.

But it\'d be nice if she could actually prove it because from what I\'ve seen, she\'s once hell of a crappy assassin. People walk in and out of her room all the time when she\'s sleeping and she just keeps on snoring. Hello, aren\'t you supposed to spring awake like a ninja and hold a knife to that person\'s throat?That\'s what I expect from someone who just left a death camp. Instead I get this.The real clincher is what I call the \'Candy Incident\'. There\'s a bag of candy left on Calaena\'s bed with no note or anything. This is during the period where a murderer is going around killing Champions and a couple have died already. And what does the\'greatest assassin in the worlddo? She gobbles them up immediately, goingOh, how I adored candies!Remember that episode in Avatar: the Last Airbender when Sokka drinks cactus juice and gets all high? Then, it wears off and this happens:Couldn\'t have said it better myself, Katara. Calaena is the kind of idiot that licks stuff off walls, even without the hallucinatory assistance of cactus juice.But wait, there\'s more! Nothing happens to her because she\'s purrrfect and fabulous, like that song from High School Musical.In fact, I\'m pretty sure she\'s a Mary Sue. Let\'s check off her traits, shall we? Tragic past, check. Pretty, check. Amazingly good at something, check. Has more than one love interest, check.Don\'t even get me started on theloveinterests.There is absolutely no difference between Dorian and Chaol except for the fact that I\'m more leery of the name Dorian. Maybe it\'s because I just recently finishedThe Picture of Dorian Grayso whenever I see his name, I think of this:It could be me but then again, you wouldn\'t name your kid Lolita, would you?And the endingwhere Calaena breaks up with Dorian because she\'s the King\'s Champion and it would beinappropriate? We all know it\'s a ploy to squeeze in some kissy-kissy time with Chaol in the next book.

After enticing me with its promises of a reading experience reminiscent of Megan Whalen Turner and George R.R. Martin, Throne of Glass ultimately let me down. Having been excited for this novel for weeks and actually liking the sample I read, I have been brought back to earth now ‚Äì with a jolt. This YA fantasy is a rather sorry example of its genre.I have the notion that a big part of this book did not work for me because of its heroine. Celeana is smart, athletic, talented and beautiful. She loves music and reading. She is fluent in different languages. She is great. And she knows it. And rubs it in your face repeatedly. As do her suitors and admirers. I had the feeling that Sarah J. Maas tried everything to make me love her heroine. How do you make readers love someone? Present them with a book lover! But somehow, she accomplished the opposite. I did not loathe Celaena, but she grated on my nerves. I wished someone would tell her off, would for once not grant her every wish; I wished the characters I liked would not fall for her charms and good looks.The little romance Celaena had (I won't say with whom) was laughable at best and mostly resulted in me rolling my eyes at the fact that the only attraction that existed between those two stemmed from them both being beautiful.In terms of plot, I cannot deny that there was always a level of suspense present. I did want to know how this story ended, and yes, there were actually parts when I feared the whole thing would not end well ‚Äì partly because my beloved heroine did not deem it necessary to inform certain people about what she had witnessed in the castle. Overall, though, the story remained a tad too juvenile and simple for me. Important events were mentioned only in passing and the mythology did not go any further than what was important for the main story line. Many things remained unsaid ‚Äì doubtlessly for the sake of sequels yet to come ‚Äì but it was not the subtle way of remaining unsaid but hinted at I love in fantasy novels, it felt more like remaining unsaid to lure me into reading on.There were aspects I liked - Celaena's friendship to Nehemia, the Eyllwe princess, and Chaol, the loyal and fierce captain of the guard ‚Äì but in the end, there isn't enough to make me interested in reading any sequels.In short - what I wanted: A less is more mentality. World building that does not only cover what is necessary to follow the main story arc. Subtle romance. Villains in different shades of grey. Assassins that actually assassinate. And do not only sit in their room talking or thinking about clothes and boys. What I got: A vain and mostly unlikeable heroine. Two men absolutely bedazzled by her presence. Hints of a love triangle. Lots and lots of descriptions of clothing. Flimsy world building. An overall poor execution writing-wise. Thank you.

I never liked the first cover, and am infinitely grateful that they changed them for the sequels. But as far as how Celaena herself is? I would say she\'s a bit of both. I feel like these covers portray two very different extremes, and Celaena seemed to possess a quality from each of them. That\'s actually what I loved about her. She\'s fast becoming one of my all-time favorite YA heroines.I\'ll admit that a long while ago, I hadn\'t expected the book to be this good.

The characters were well formed and excellently developed. There are recognisable and enjoyable twists on the classic Cinderella. Example Celaena Sardothien's fairy godmother is a ghost of an ancient warrior queen. There are also slight touches, such as Celaena having an innate charm with animals.I was also very impressed with the pacing and evolution of the story. Honestly, the 406 pages just seem to fly by. Just because Celaena was the greatest of assassins after being in a death camp for over a year, she needed to capture her old form, but her skills are still intact. Also, I like the way the author plays with her feelings. Even though she is an assassin, she is still very young and prone to her feelings and ego getting hurt.The book does leave a lot of questions, many of which are for the second novel, but as much as I hate prequels, I will have to read the backup stories on the Kindle version. I can't wait for the next book and am really looking forward to what is going to happen next.

I take full offense at badassery being missed.But seriously, guys, this book suffers from fuckingterriblecharacter work.Thesis Statement:Celaena is a badly written character.She is arrogant as hell, really petty, and somewhat obsessed with her own appearance. Andthat\'snot even the problem - a horribly unlikable assassin as a lead character could be amazing. But Celaena doesnothave enough character depth for her unlikability to be tolerable. Her alleged tragic past? Pretty much not represented on page. Frankly, tragic pasts need alotof fleshing out to be compelling and believable, and I don\'t even think Celaena\'s trauma is acknowledgedoncein this book - come on, at least do the bare minimum?Listen, okay, you want to get me started on my #1 pet peeve in YA for all eternity?Heroines that have less sense than the audience. I like my heroines to be one step ahead of me, or at my level. Let\'s talk about the fact that Celaena is just... a complete idiot.Some assassin. I am 98% sure I have more sense than this character / prop for love triangles does. Like, I\'m sorry, but how am I supposed to be intimidated by someone who 98% of the audience could outthink?I am so disappointed by all this character could have been and all this character is not. completely lighthearted. Again, that could be super enjoyable to read about! I\'d LOVE a book about a slightly unbalanced girl who murders people with a smile on her face. This could be Celaena if she were cleverer and a bit - okay, a lot - more fleshed out. But she\'s just an unbelievable, annoying heroine.And Jesus,I am so annoyed by the love triangle. Dorian is just flat as hell and has no character. Chaol is... okay, I know someone is going to fight me over this but I do not care.Chaol is an overprotective ass. I can\'t believe he\'s supposed to be the good romantic interest compared to Rowan. Jesus, how bad is Rowan? What is happening in this damn series??And yeah, I forgot just how much I hated it until the hateread, but the writing style of this book is worse than amateur. It is so tedious, it is so typical, and it issooverdramatic. I take full issue with both overuse of exclamation pointsandlack of ability to truly get into a character\'s head.I have made my decision and I am not continuing.Blog|Goodreads|Twitter|Youtube'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'upon reread, i am going to bump up my rating. knowing how the story plays out over the span of 7 books, its allowed me to view this with a different perspective and im able to appreciate this more than when i started the series for the first time.what i thought was simplistic storytelling, i now see humble beginnings. what i thought was lack of plot, i now see subtly laid foundations. and what i thought was a predictable ending, i now see necessary building blocks.i think this will still remain my least favourite book in the series (which really isnt saying much) but its nice to know that i enjoyed this more than i did the first time, if only for sentimental reasons.‚Ü†4.5 stars'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""4.5 stars!

Maas novel, and I don‚Äôt understand the hype. Warning: extremely sarcastic book review coming up!Celaena Sardothien is the world‚Äôs most famous assassin. However, she has been captured and is doing hard labor in a mine. Today is her lucky day though. The kind and absolutely dashing Prince Dorian arrives to save the day! Celaena can enter a competition to be the King‚Äôs Champion. If she wins the competition, she then has to serve four years of service under the king, and then she is free! Yippie!The concepts in this book sound right up my alley. Female characters? Yes. However, my gosh, this is probably the most unlikeable character that I have ever endured. I was hoping that someone would finish her off.Celaena is one of the least humble characters ever written. She is the female version of Gaston from Beauty and The Beast but worse. So much of the book is about, ‚ÄúOh, I could take this guy down with one bat of an eye.‚Äù Give me a break. When she finally arrives for the competition, she does not seem to do any training other than what is forced on her by Prince Dorian or Chaol. If you want to be the best at something, you usually have a routine. Each day, you know exactly what to do to train and prepare.Celaena likes to sleep in and dream of kissing. I really wish that I was still producing Booktube videos because this book would make a great spoof video. I will just have to do my best to state the overexaggerated nature of Celaena.If Celaena was a book influencer, she started reading when she was three-months old. She has read a book in every state and country. She has read every book on every checklist, and she has a photographic memory. When she gets ready for a book quiz, she doesn‚Äôt even open the book to refresh her memory. And she giggles and dreams of boys kissing her. Tee-hee!The ‚Äúromance‚Äù in this book is absolute cringe. One of her suitors is so struck by her beauty. Apparently, Celanea should have a GoodReads account, because nearly every day she could have the opportunity to receive creepy ‚Äúhey beautiful‚Äù messages from fake accounts. This would make her swoon. Although someone can compliment a person on his or her beauty, so what? Beautiful is primarily about winning the genetic lottery. If you want to really compliment a person, say something about their work ethic, their kind and gentle nature, their thirst for knowledge, their passion to change the world.Throne of Glass is so boring. The King‚Äôs Champion has various stages to the competition. Because of the writing style, the suspense did not build. There is a stage of the competition, and it is described in a paragraph or one page. And people die in this book. However, our ‚Äúworld-famous‚Äù assassin Celaena does very little about it. Sucks to be them I guess. She is too busy thinking about kisses. The characters aren‚Äôt developed enough so when they die off, no one cares.This book completely lacks the strong female characters that I love. This is a love-sick assassin who doesn‚Äôt really show her full capabilities. It is really hard to take her seriously when she spends more time pouting about festivals and dreaming of kisses than preparing to win the championship.Also, anyone who has less than perfect skin is ‚Äúbad‚Äù in this book. I have a real problem with this. Beauty is only skin deep, and I would rather have a partnership with someone with bad skin and has a bit of sense than someone who is ‚Äúgorgeous‚Äù and can‚Äôt hold up their end of a conversation. But personal preference.Overall, the concept of a strong female assassin in a slightly fantasy setting sounds appealing; however, Sarah J. Maas did not execute it properly in Throne of Glass. If you really want a strong female character in a fantasy setting, I highly suggest The Golden Compass or Northern Lights by Philip Pullman. Lyra beats Celaena every single day of the week.2025 Reading ScheduleJan\tA Town Like AliceFeb\tBirdsongMar\tCaptain Corelli's Mandolin - Louis De BerniereApr\tWar and PeaceMay\tThe Woman in WhiteJun\tAtonementJul\tThe Shadow of the WindAug\tJude the ObscureSep\tUlyssesOct\tVanity FairNov\tA Fine BalanceDec\tGerminalConnect With Me!BlogTwitterBookTubeInstaMy Bookstore at Pango""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '3.5-4 StarsYeah, I know.

And this book in particular as it was my least favourite. But it helped reading The Assassin's Blade before Throne of Glass as it delved deeper into Celaena's character and through that book one was able to form a connection with her.Her skills as an assassin aren't really explored in Throne of Glass, it's all talk and no action. But reading the prequel novellas, you are able to see how hardcore she actually is, thus accepting the all talk and no action that happens in Throne of Glass.I love the characters, the world and Maas's writing. I always feel so wrapped in it!So many hints were dropped in this book that are explored in the other books. I loved being able to pick up on them this time round and appreciate that Maas cleverly plants those points in her books and later builds up upon them so thoroughly.""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""We each survive in our own way.This is going to be a rather personal review becauseThrone of Glasstook away a week of my life and my SJM virginity.I wish I‚Äôd let it wine and dine me, first.At least, I‚Äôd still have the good memory of a nice six course dinner.It‚Äôs not like I have a problem with this book, but‚Ä¶I do have a problem with this book.A couple, actually, and they mainly involve the writing and a certain main character which I won't name for now.Now, before I start, I must say that I‚Äôve been forewarned by a lot of readers that this is probably the weakest book in the series and that the writing is a bit quirky, because at the time, the author was young and (I suppose) unexperienced. I can see that. I actually could see a writing style development between the first and the second half of the book.This to say that, since from the beginning, I didn‚Äôt expect much.But since I‚Äôm here do discuss books and not to dig into the author‚Äôs background, I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the writing. Too many exclamation points!!!!!!too much self-indulgence in the characters descriptions and actions, and, definitely, too much walking around the edges.Sometimes I like it when a bookshowsits contents rather than shoving them explicitly into the writing as to say ‚Äúhey, here‚Äôs how you‚Äôre suppose to interpret said emotion and fact‚Äù, and so on.I don't like that, nuh-uh.Plus, most of the time, it really looked and felt like a thirteen-year-old fangirl wrote a fanfiction based on scratches of books she's seen her big sister read.The plot is not bad. There‚Äôs magic and princes and the right amount of stabby-stabbing.Not bad, but not breath-taking, either. I'm not giving up, though, because I trust my fellow readers and I believe it when they say it's gonna get better.Well,Now, another thing that threw me almost completely off the Throne of Glass Train, was the main character, Celeana Sardothien.Oh, boy. I had such a hard time with this one.Not only I didn't connect with her and her way of thinking before the very last chapters, she's also made it into my Top 3 of most annoying characters thanks to her immaturity.I think only America Singer fromThe Selectionand Zoey Redbird fromMarkedcould top that, and this is saying a lot.She‚Äôs like that popular chick in high school who thinks she‚Äôs head and shoulders above the others. She‚Äôs like Regina George with daggers and an even snarkier holier-than-thou attitude.Basically Celeana in every single line ever:For someone who's supposed to be a deadly assassin, she's pretty weak and dull. I get it that she's a girl who likes being pretty and wearing nice clothes and dating hot boys (I actually love it when a female character can be girly and badass at the same time), but she's just so narcissistic and stubborn, she never (or rarely) speaks without thinking first, that you can't help but put aside her best sides and focus on the tooth-cringing ones. Sometimes, she really lacks tact, not to mention good manners, and, for the most part, she walks around feeling like she invented the concept of being a badass. I‚Äôve got news for you, Cece. You still have a lot of road ahead.So flipping frustrating.Sure, she had her good moments, I actually appreciated her spirit and braveness in many occasions, but they were rare and ephemeral enough that they couldn‚Äôt have overcome the flaws even if Batman himself joined the collab.I really hope she‚Äôll redeem herself, or at least, grow some sense into that little superiority complex-affected brain of hers.To be completely honest, sometimes I even enjoyed this book, but I couldn't help but notice they were chapters or paragraphs in which Celeana was silent or absent or too busy fighting for her freedom to care about other stuff.Ahem, I'll leave the math to you, peeps.Bless the multi-pov option! I really didn‚Äôt mind at all those Dorian or Chaol chapters.And, yes, feel free to read this as: I really didn‚Äôt mind Dorian nor Chaol.Which brings us to the romance side.Guess what? There was a love triangle! *fakes shock* I know.So. Original. And. Unexpected.Even if Huey, Dewey, and Louie engaged in some sort of inevitable, twisted and confused love triangle, which I‚Äôll never be a fan of, I still couldn‚Äôt care enough to let it bother me. Just give me some substance, I don‚Äôt care who sucks whose face.Now, at the question, do you ship Celeana with Dorian or Chaol, I'll reply: WHAT EVEN IS SHIPPING ANYMORE.Since, y'know, I think it'd too much to hope Dorian and Chaol will both dump Sardothien, grab a dozen puppies each, and ride their way into the sunset, together.The other characters didn‚Äôt really convince me that much (although no one got nearly on my nerves as Miss Main Character did), I felt like there could have been more work behind, just like the whole story didn‚Äôt exactly engage me from start to end for the very same reason.You can tell someone didn't really do their best at researching. The setting and the way all characters behave could have been a little more authentic, and, holy crow, theooc-ismwas too much, even for a mediocre book.Still, I think after a good 60%, both the writing and the plot really improve right before my eyes.I‚Äôm convinced, maybe, I would have loved this book better if I read it when it first came out.I have too high standards now. really, it's like a curse.I‚Äôve never really followed SJM but I feel like I should give her another chance (brain screaming: I WANT MORE DORIAN AND CHAOL). I‚Äôll try not to let it influence negatively my coming judgment and consider this book an isolated case, and also this series‚Äô chance to prove how sometimes books can upgrade in reverse, and put some more hopes intoCrown of Midnight.Until then, two and a half stars are more than enough.ACTUAL RATINGS 2.5/5{update July 2021: while my opinion on this book hasn't changed at all (Throne of Glass was and still is a let down with insufferable characters and cringey writing) I wanted to make this little update to tell whoever will read this review that I ended up caving and I continued the series, and I'm glad I did, because it really does get better. The plot in particular. SJM stepped up her writing game and I also ended up liking celaena's character development. This to say, don't be surprised if you step upon another of my THG reviews and find it more positive than this one.

I heard it being sold as GRR Martin\'sGame of Throneswritten for the female audience --- well, as a female audience, I am offended. As an avid reader of the fantasy genre, I am saddened that this is marketed as a fantasy-for-females. Thisbeing a YA does not excuse it from being riddled with clich√©s, painfully obvious foreshadowing, and a ghost of a fantasy worldruthlessly overshadowed by romantic overtones.Fans of fantasy -actualfantasy - I don\'t suppose would much enjoyThrone of Glass, either. And even though the synopsis makes it soundHunger Games-esque, I\'m afraid on that front, you\'d be disappointed, too.I would say, if you enjoyedThe SelectionbyKiera Cass, but long for a lessself-abasingcharacter than America, then I think you might enjoyThrone of Glass.I must warn you:this review will be long, and most of it dedicated to a bit of a character study if anything; and whySarah J Maas failed at her character of an assassin. But let\'s start at the beginning.Celaena Sardothien has spent years in the death camps of Endovier, where she will ultimately spend the rest of her life. Until, that is, crown prince Dorian appoints her to enter in a competition for the title of King\'s Champion, who will be tasked to do the King\'s secret bidding. But when one by one, the competitors turn up dead, Celaena knows that something evil lurks the castle.Instead of the action-packed novel I was lead to believe I\'d be reading, all I got were ... balls and dances, and then some fight scenes are thrown in there just to make sure we don\'tforgetthat this is supposed to be a story of an assassin. No,Sarah J Maas, I hopeyoudon\'t forget what we came here for.When I say thatThrone of Glasslowers the standards of Fantasy, I mean that it doesn\'t seem to know much about its own setting.Royal Households everywhere, at every turn of the century, have a set of rules dictating things such as etiquette; what is proper and what isimproper. And these rules don\'t exist for the sake of it - there arereasonsbehind etiquette: to prevent affronting your peers, for instance. To prevent harmful court gossip. To prevent a crown prince from running around and fathering a thousand bastards before he is even dubbed King, creating more than enough future claimants to the throne.I assume the same applies inThrone of Glass; for instance thereareetiquettes mentioned that deem a prince dancing with only one partner something considerably rude.Soit threw me way out of time and placewhen I found out that Chaol, Captain of the Guards, would enter Celaena\'s chambers at any time of day he wishes - even when she\'s still dressed in her scanty nightgown.Even the Prince does this; visiting her whensoever he pleases. You may call me a prude, you may call me many anti-feminist names, but this is not acceptable. Not because I give two cents on what the court would say about Celaena; not that I give two cents whether or not the prince was copulating with her; butbecause this is simply not done. Especiallynotwithout repercussion, if even in the form of social stigma.Celaena had a maid waiting on her - but it seems that all she was good for was putting her clothes on. It wasChaolwho barged in her room, underdressed as she was, just to wake her up. He is aCaptain of the Guards. This should not even be his task!These small, ridiculousignorance of Royal Household etiquetteanddivision of labourmade it seem as if the whole thing was poorly researched. You may argue that this wasnotfeudal England; that this world was built entirely ofMaas\' imagination, but things such aslogicshould still apply. And when has iteverbeen logical for aCaptain of Guardsto be responsible for waking up guests? When has it ever beenacceptablefor a Prince to come and go, without repercussion, into a common girl\'s chambers?But that is exactly the problem withThrone of Glass.The entire premisewasn\'tlogical.By this I am of course talking about the King\'s competition.""(...) He\'s hosting a competition. He invited twenty-three members of his council to each sponsor a would-be Champion to train in the glass castle and ultimately compete in a duel.""... and this Champion of his is tasked ...To work for the King of Adarlan as his loyal servant. She raised her chin. To kill for him (...)But where is the logic fail?you ask me. Allow me to reiterate. He wants aloyalsubject to kill for him, without question, with the utmost secrecy. Yet he chooses thisloyal subjectthrough acompetition. Not only that, he makes hiscouncilmenchoose the competitors for him.I may not be a direct member of a royal family myself, but I know there are things such as courtintrigueandhidden agendasand hell, there are hundreds upon thousands of discrete allegiances and plots being made left, right and centre.Do youreallywant yourfuture, ""loyal"" Championto be handpicked out of a number ofcriminalsand entrusted to yourcouncilmen?The whole competition thing wasn\'t at all very thought through. In the end, it felt as if it was just there to get the story going, to get Celaena into the castle.The competition itself was a let downnstead of some fight-to-the-death (or similar) trope, we get ... a race. An archery competition. Wall-climbing. And a lot of others that happened off screen.Amidst all these competitions and training programs, the plot scattered into flirting banter, gatecrashing parties, and some girl-on-girl hating; as ifthe author wasn\'t quite sure whether she wanted her novel to be the story of a ruthless assassin, or the romances of a ruthless assassin princess-wannabe.And now I get to Celaena, the princess-wannabe. Allow me to present a number of quotes I\'ve highlighted:She loved clothes--loved the feeling of silk, of velvet, of satin, of suede and chiffon--and was fascinated by the grace of seams, the intricate perfection of an embossed surface. And when she won this ridiculous competition, when she was free ... she could buy all the clothes she wanted.*Everything was wet and half-frozen, and while she could bear sodden hair, she couldn\'t withstand the agony of wet shoes.*There were more Champions seated at the tables--even the pimply-faced Pelor sat near Chaol! A half-rate boy assassin! She bared her teeth. How dare she be denied an invitation to the feast?You read all that and tell me, do you imagine these thoughts coming from a renown, world-classassassin?An assasin complaining about her wet shoes?About not being invitedto a banquet?No. Two things strike me here: First,she had just spent years at adeath camp, but her behaviour upon leaving it did not portray any humility or gratefulness of being far away from all those whippings and forced labour. You\'d think she\'d just be glad to be away from the mines and pickaxe to becomplaining about wet shoesSMH.Second;this sounds more like something a ditzy princess-wannabe would say. Oh, after I win this competition,I\'m gonna buy myself some clothes. For someone who has spent years suffering, who spent her childhood being trained as a ruthless killer, she comes across sounding soprivileged.Now, I\'m not an assassin. I\'ve never beentrainedas one, but for years Ididgo through a whole series of martial arts before finding one that suited my small stature. And ofallmartial arts -- from karate to jiu-jitsu to wushu to the one I finally settled with -- there wasone thingwe were taught was the foundation of any great martial artist.Discipline.And I\'m sorry, Celaena. Butyou don\'t have it.This is her reaction tofailing at a game of pool:A shriek of rage ripped from her throat, and Celaena ran over to the pocket. She first screamed at the ball, then took the cue in her hands and bit down upon the shaft, still screaming through her clamped teeth. Finally the assassin stopped and slapped the three ball into the pocket.This is her discipline at training:""It\'s cold,"" she moaned, holding her knees to her body. She didn\'t care that she had only a few months to beat the other Champions--she needed sleep.""I\'m afraid it doesn\'t work that way; you don\'t get to tell me that this girl is an accomplished, feared assassin at the age of.... sixteen?.... buther entire mentality, her entirepersonalitydoes not ring true of an assassin.Do you think the realm\'s greatest killer would be afraid ofwalking in a glass house?""Only an idiot would walk in a house made of glass.""(...)The thought of standing on floors of glass made her queasy.....afraid ofheights?She had a terrible headache around her left temple. Everything was sickly and frail. They were so high up, so dangerously high ...Do you think they moan and whinge and complain at the drop of a hat?Once they\'d finished their run, they trained in a private room far from her competitor\'s eyes. Until, that is, she collapsed to the ground and cried that she was about to die of hunger and fatigue.*Celaena frowned at herself as she hurried after the captain into the foyer. ""I look ridiculous! These pants are absurd, and this shirt is awful.""For heaven\'s sake, you\'re an assassin, not a supermodel. No. Discipline doesn\'t just mean getting up every morning and training every day. It also means adiscipline of the mind. It means self-restraint. It means keeping your head low. What kind of assassinwantsto be the centre of attention?? To have her skills known?? If you want glory, then you\'re in the wrong career path. Be a damned knight.But Celaena isvainandself-absorbed. Shewants to be in the spotlight.""I hate all these guards and nonsense; I hate you telling me to hold back when Brullo sings Cain\'s praises and I\'m just there, boring and unnoticed in the middle.""*""Do you know how insulting it is to pretend to be some nobody thief from a small city in Fenharrow?""Not only that, but she\'s also very contradictory and hypocritical:What was a ""Champion"" but a dressed-up name for murderer? Could she actually stomach working for him?And I suppose ""assassin"" is just a synonym for mercy-killer? But enough of her faults.Let\'s take a look at her more positive attributes.She\'s beautiful. In factsobeautiful that she drains the blood out of peoplewho sees her:Celaena smiled smugly to herself as she nodded to a passing noble-man, who raised his eyebrows at the sight of her. He was immensely pale, she noticed as he opened his mouth to say something, but Celaena continued down the hall.In factsobeautiful that other ladies envy her and she has to shove that in their facesbecause you can\'t have a YA novel without other girls being envious of our heroine!:She smiled at the young chevaliers as they passed--and smirked at the court women who eyed her pink-and-white gown. She couldn\'t blame them; the dress was spectacular. And she was spectacular in it. Even Redd, one of the handsomer guards posted outside her rooms, had said so.Also shallow, as it seems, because if Reddhadn\'tbeen handsome, his opinion wouldn\'t have mattered, right?Still not convinced that she\'s shallow?Why did Chaol never joke with her as Dorian did? Perhaps he truly didn\'t find her attractive. The possibility of it stung more than she would have liked.You see,because people can only like you if you\'reattractive. Oh, sorry, I got sidetracked. We were talking over herpositiveattributes. Well, she\'s a great dancer:She didn\'t falter a single step, nor did she seem to care about the many angry female faces that watched as dance after dance passed and they didn\'t switch partners.She also plays ameanpianobecause music is like, the way we show just how deep and artistic our heroine is:Celaena eyed the pianoforte. She used to play--oh, she\'d loved to play, loved music(...)Shelovesdogsbecause that\'s how we know she\'s a kind-hearted person. No evil person is an animal lover!:""Of course I want her,"" Celaena said, then realized what the implications would be. ""But I want her trained. I don\'t want her urinating on everything and chewing on furniture and shows and books. And I want her to sit when I tell her to and lay down and roll over (...)Oh, but she doesn\'t want to beinconveniencedso she doesn\'t want totrain it herselfof course! She speaks foreign languages,and!just so we canallrelate to her-- she also loves books!I could go on andpoint out her inconsistencies, but this is getting much too long for my liking. In short,Celaena Sardothien is a Mary Sue. But even worse --she is anunlikeable, vain, shallow, self-centred Mary Sue. And if you expect me to believe she\'s a deadly killer, then you better think again.But that is the final problem I had with this book -- the narratorconstantlytells us what to believe.There was something great and deadly concealed within her, and he didn\'t like it.while moments later, she\'s rolling on the ground, crying and whinging that she\'s gonna die of starvation. Yeah, no.Also,""Because it looks like he\'s in love with her,"" he said, and walked away.(...) His shoulders were straight, his back erect. He looked like a man. Like a king.Yeah, if you say so.But,you say to me,there must besomethingyou liked?Well, Ididlike Celaena\'s relationship with the err, Indian princess. I forgot her name. Because I didn\'t like the actual princess herself -- she doesn\'t know tact. She doesn\'t know diplomacy. She comes to a foreign realm and all she does is whinge and insult their language and clothes and court.So, no. I didn\'t like the plot, I didn\'t like the characters. The only stars go to Chaol for being a beacon of sanity amidst all the awfulness. It\'s a pity he, too, fell for our Mary Sue.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '""I swear on my crown that the pup shall live.""The five Throne of Glass novellas did a great job convincing me to push toward the main series. I mean what\'s not to like: A mysterious new world, a set of interesting characters (in novellas) and a lot of potential plot-lines to explore. But, after reading this first book, the only reason I\'m rounding up what felt like a 2.5-star read to 3-star (instead of 2) is, me not belonging in the intended audience. But even for a young audience, I believe some of the stuff here are too shallow and rudimentary, especially in the first half of the book.Though it wasn\'t much original, I still found the plot to be interesting. The unfairly convicted protagonist trying to make a change by fighting on multiple fronts, and some politics to keep things heated among characters, while adding a bit of dark magic to have a little mysteriousness. Story starts with Celaena being conditionally released from prison, to participate in a competition which expects to select a champion for the king. I was under the impression that this competition would be the main plotline, but it was mostly on sidelines. Politics played a major part, and I think that\'s what I enjoyed the most here. As for magic, there wasn\'t a whole lot of revelations in this one, however I\'m hoping everything would become clear in time. But after a few chapters, it quickly becomes apparent that the main theme here is romance. Everything revolves around Dorian - Celaena - Chaol trio, and leading up to a too obvious love triangle. But at least, it\'s not one of those terrible ones, where one of the three being a complete villain. The pace of the story was also okay, and even though the book wasn\'t much impactful, it was kind of a fun read overall. But the prose has a lot of room to improve, especially by moving beyond the pure melodramatic conversation.However, I have to admit, it did get better towards the end. Even though the villain turned out to be the obvious one, I loved the detailed final battle, until the very end.From the very first page, I didn\'t expect much from Celaena. It was clear from the novellas, aside from being fun, she had a number of conflicting traits, and was not very congruous with being an infamous assassin. Trying to squeeze in this many qualities to a single character is hardly a good idea, even if the character is of an age suit to be full of wisdom, and experience. But when you try that with an eighteen year old girl, who is the definition of impulsiveness, it is not surprising that the character turning out to be an annoyance. Even if the author had intended to create a strong role model for readers of the intended audience, I think the character came out looking too shallow, and inconsistent. I\'m not giving examples to avoid spoilers, but one does not have to look deep to find her shortcomings. Celaena might be a very popular character but she is anything but a role-model in my opinion.If it wasn\'t for the novellas, I probably would not have finished this book. And even with the novellas, I still might\'ve discontinued, if it wasn\'t for the shared opinion among many that first couple of books being the weakest in the series. I hope, at least in time, these qualities would fade away. At this point, I cannot say that I liked the prose that much either, but I\'m hoping that\'d improve as well.""So, I highly suggest, Miss Sardothien, that you get your arrogance in check.""'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'This book was sooooo goood!

You should see my Harry Potter stuff =) ‚ÜìI listened to the audio this time. It took a minute to get used to the narrator but I finally got settled in with her.I love Celaena Sardothien. She was taken from Endovier (the death camp) and brought to the castle to fight with other Champions. If she wins then she has to kill for the King for 4 years and then she is free. I have a feeling that\'s not to be. Prince Dorian is the one that chose her as his champion to fight against the others. Celaena is being called Lady Lillian because they don\'t want anyone to know who she is, since she is a bad @ssed assassin.I loved and still to this day love Chaol. But, I never liked the fact that Dorian and Celaena shared a few kisses. Ewww, I just don\'t like Dorian that way. He\'s like a best boy friend. I do love that he gave Celaena a dog she named, Fleetfoot =)I mean Calaena loves books and dogs and she\'s an assassin. How awesome is that.

Maas! This is a very popular series. An extremely popular series, an exceptionally hyped up series, a tremendouslyOLD AF SERIES. Listen to me here, if I were a fantasy fan when I was a teenager, I would have definitely read this book. But you know, my relationship with fantasy hasn\'t been lit for the last2583 years, so I hadn\'t picked it up. I started loving fantasy again this year because ofA Court of Thorns and Roses, a book I bought because I needed it for my uni thesis, not because I was interested in reading fantasy again.SO YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH WORK I GOT WITH FANTASY BOOKS. I haven\'t read fantasy since 2010. I have a million fantasy series to catch up to. I\'m nervous.I WANT TO READ ALL THE FANTASY NOW AND NOTHING BUT FANTASY.ANYWAY, LET\'S TALK ABOUT THIS BOOK.After serving out a year of hard labor in the salt mines of Endovier for her crimes, 18-year-old assassin Celaena Sardothien is dragged before the Crown Prince. Prince Dorian offers her her freedom on one condition: she must act as his champion in a competition to find a new royal assassin.Her opponents are men-thieves and assassins and warriors from across the empire, each sponsored by a member of the king\'s council. If she beats her opponents in a series of eliminations, she\'ll serve the kingdom for four years and then be granted her freedom. Celaena finds her training sessions with the captain of the guard, Westfall, challenging and exhilarating. But she\'s bored stiff by court life. Things get a little more interesting when the prince starts to show interest in her ... but it\'s the gruff Captain Westfall who seems to understand her best.Then one of the other contestants turns up dead ... quickly followed by another. Can Celaena figure out who the killer is before she becomes a victim? As the young assassin investigates, her search leads her to discover a greater destiny than she could possibly have imagined.I had very high expectations for this book which were partially met. As I said before, my firstSarah J. Maasbook isA Court of Thorns and Roses, which is the her latest series. Most of you have readThrone of Glassfirst and thenA Court of Thorns and Roses, and you have experienced her writing flourish. I haven\'t. I read her better book first. I can see now that she has improved so much, her writing is so much better now. Some things in the writing of this book weren\'t my thing, like repetitions of some phrases, ""assassin"" being referred to Celaena the whole entire time (which bugged me a bit), poor choice of words at some parts. But I recognized Sarah in this book. I can recognize her writing style now, and I truly love it.This book gave me suchGame of ThronesandHarry Potter and the Goblet of Firevibes! From the badass main character with the hard to pronounce name which reminded me ofDaenerys Targaryento the championship which was like theTriwizard TournamentinGoblet of Fire, the vibes were fucking lit yo! The worldSarah J. Maashas created in this book was so immersive, I was so into it when I was reading the book. I wasn\'t even confused with all the names and places and words, it all came natural to me. I can see how after this book, the world will expand to an enormous extend with magic and Fae and so many new characters appearing, and I\'m here for it!The multiple character perspectives was a surprise to me. Celaena owns the most chapters, but we can see things told from mostly all the characters, (even the fucking King) which is something I was surprised about as it does not happen in her other series. I loved it. This is what I missed from theA Court of Thorns and Rosesseries. The multiple character POVs. And I relish in the fact that we can explore things from numerous viewpoints.CELAENA GUYS. CELAENA SARDOTHIEN. I LOVE YOU TO THE MOON AND BACK. I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY AND FIND THE BEST MATCH FOR YOU AND UNDERSTAND YOUR PAST AND YOUR LINEAGE AND BASICALLY CONTINUE TO BE A BADASS QUEEN. I didn\'t expect her character to be like this, to be honest. The book description suggested a ruthless, cold-hearted killer, and I expected as much. But her compassion and her kindness and her passion for multiple things showed from the very first pages. She is a merciless assassin who can end you with a snap of her finger but she has also kept her personality. Her humor, her quirkiness. She loves beautiful dresses, she loves to eat good food, puppies üê∂, and she loves books.SHE IS A READER GUYS. I absolutelyADOREwhen book characters are readers. Especially in fantasy. I can relate to them so much easier.I immensely appreciated her friendship with Nehemia and that it wasn\'t ruined at the end. I was so scared about this. I loathe when they make female characters hate each other in books, especially about a love interest! Just don\'t, please.Girls need to stick together!I want to see more of her in the future books. I\'m sure we will, but it was left kind of wonky in this book. I suspected her too, in the middle of the book, and I was certain it was her, orchestrating everything. But it was Cain. The obvious choice. It was anticlimactic, to be totally honest. I wanted it to be someone else. We all expected Cain, and it was Cain. I didn\'t believe it would be him, I was certain there would be a plot twist, at the end, or something. But no.AND NOWWWWWWthe romance. I love both Dorian and Chaol, both for different reasons. I\'m so fond of the relationships Celaena holds with both of them. They\'re so different, and yet they both mean so much to her.I SHIPPED BOTH THOSE SHIPS THROUGHOUT THIS BOOK.But I lean like 51% on Dorian. Their scenes were cuter, and I think they have more things in common. Their passion for books, the billiard scenes, the music scene,THE FUCKING PUPPY, the dance, the kisses, the candy. They made me feels so many things! And then we have scenes with Chaol and I was back in that train again.COME ON CELAENA, DARLING, JUST CHOOSE. I will choose for you, but for myself. I have no problem with that, sweetie üòâ I was conflicted about her train of thought, to be frank. The one moment she found Dorian extremely attractive and she wanted to kiss him, and the next she found Chaol handsome and she wanted to spend more and more time with him. I was as much confused as she is. But I\'m delighted that the author didn\'t make the romance the main part of the book. She didn\'t portray Celaena as a character who depends on a man to save her, or to make her feels special or anything alike. She would have been fine without them as love interests in her life. Furthermore, I have to talk about Nox. What a sweetheart. What a wasted opportunity on a character. We basically saw nothing of him. I thought he was gonna be a third love interest in the beginning and I was like""WOAH WOAH THERE SARAH HON SLOW DOWN""but luckily he wasn\'t. But I kept thinking about his character.YOU\'RE THE TRUE AND UNDOUBTFUL EPITOME OF THE WORD ""FRIENDZONE"". I hope we see him again.The final battle... oh man. It dragged more than it should, to be honest, but it was breathtaking. Sarah knows how to write a good jaw-dropping ending. There was so much information throughout this whole battle, that I had to reread some parts to totally grasp what was going on. It was so intense and magical and out of this world. I was so proud of myGIRLfor still being strong and trying to fight even though she was drugged. She made me believe, at some parts, that she would win. Kaltain. UGH. May we never see this bitch again. I WAS SO HAPPY WHEN WE FOUND OUT THE DUKE WAS SCHEMING BEHIND HER BACK ALL ALONG. I know we will see her again, but fuck her. I don\'t want to see her lying ass point of view again.To sum it all up, this was a pretty strong beginning to a series. I only gave it4 starsbecause it didn\'t overwhelm me. I keep comparing it to A Court of Thorns and Roses, which is like my favorite series, at the moment. I can\'t stop comparing these two series, damn it. But I loved it nonetheless and I\'m waiting for the next book,Crown of Midnight, to arrive. I\'m actually pretty excited, cause I have heard these books get so much better. and I can already see that. So till the next one... K BYE!!'}]"

The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo

AFTER THIS LINE I HAD TO FINISH THIS BOOK.And I decided I would finish it. I would read more than 150 pages and finish it. So I went to my obligation the next day with 4 hours of sleep but I was happy about it. Because I knew I couldn\'t survive a whole day without finishing this book. I would die. This is the impact this book has had on me. Now, let\'s talk specifics.Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one in the journalism community is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband, David, has left her, and her career has stagnated. Regardless of why Evelyn has chosen her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.Summoned to Evelyn‚Äôs Upper East Side apartment, Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late 80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way. As Evelyn‚Äôs life unfolds through the decades‚Äîrevealing a ruthless ambition, an unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love‚ÄîMonique begins to feel a very a real connection to the actress. But as Evelyn‚Äôs story catches up with the present, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique‚Äôs own in tragic and irreversible ways.Historical fiction is my favorite genre of all time. I love it in every form, books, tv shows, movies. But not this kind of historical fiction, theOutlanderandRoss Poldarkkind of historical fiction. The older one, you could say. Also, historical fiction about wars and stuff, which is more recent. But I have never read something about the Old Hollywood. I have only watched movies and tv shows about it. So this was new territory for me.I will admit, it took me about 150 pages to get fully immersed into the story. Up until that point, the book was a 4 star for me. Which is still amazing, but I didn\'t quite understand the hype till that point. A little after Evelyn divulges her secret love, and basically everything starts, my wig is totally snatched. I\'m into the book 100%, ready to knowEVERYTHINGaboutEVERYTHING. The pace was so incredibly fast, there was not a moment I felt my eyes close. The writing was impeccable, some narrations of scenes kept my heart racing. There weren\'t any redundant descriptions of places or rooms, there were descriptions of faces and clothes which kept me enthralled into to the story. The author did an amazing research, it was obvious that she knew her shit, everything was on point. The story kept me on my toes each time with its smart maneuvers, the schemes, the plans, everything the main characters did, all the choices they made, to dodge unfortunate situations. Everything was just... on point. I have nothing bad to say. This never happens. This book was just too perfect. I want to cry because, if not for the hype, I wouldn\'t have picked up this book. And I would have lost such an amazing journey, such an important book. Thank you all for loving this book and making me love it too.Evelyn. Evelyn Hugo is the most flawlessly written character I have ever witnessed. No, wrong. She isn\'t a character to me. She is a person. With influences fromMerilyn MonroeandElizabeth Taylor, the author made Evelyn Hugo her own star. Every time I would read about a scene from one of the movies, I was like ""Oh, I will watch that movie next."", and then I remembered that she doesn\'t actually exist. Which made me sad, because all of the content of this book was so interesting. I felt like I was reading an actual autobiography from a real legendary actress. It was incredible. Evelyn is such a good written character, a good written character, not a good person. She is raw, devious, manipulative, scheming, cold-hearted. She is basically a bitch. But you can\'t help but to want to know everything about her. You want to slap the shit out of her one moment and then hug her the next. She is sensual, enticing, seductive. She always knows what to say to make you believe in her cause. She uses her greatest assets to her benefit, and she isn\'t ashamed about it. She doesn\'t give a fuck. She wants to climb the ladder and she will do anything to achieve her goal. Even marry seven men who will serve her purpose. And she does it. With her scandalous life and her improved acting skills and beneficial movie choices, she climbs to the top. But we also see her sensitive side, her human side. We see her deep friendship with Harry, another remarkable character. We see her love for her child. We see her devotion to Celia. We see her as a human too, with real emotions. And I find that marvelous. I wish all characters in books had so much depth, so much meaning. And not the John Green kind of pretentious deep meaning. The real one.Monique. An underdeveloped character, in my opinion. I didn\'t care that much about her, but her story was gripping. To be honest, Evelyn didn\'t let me care a lot about any other character. She took my attention all to herself. Which is what she did with the entire world. But anyway. An unknown journalist requested to write one of the most popular actresses\' biography. A 35 year old woman, who feels like she hasn\'t achieved much so far in her life. She has a ruined marriage, an under prestigious job, she has been under appreciated all her life, even though she possesses many skills. She is also a POC, and she is mislabeled literally every day. I needed more of her character, I needed to see more of her. But after Evelyn\'s story started, we didn\'t get much of her. But I\'m so happy that she stood up to herself and her self love grew. That Evelyn showed her the way, and she got out of a meaningless marriage, she made deals regarding her job, her future, she stood on her own two feet. I\'m really proud of her.THE REPRESENTATION. THIS BOOK HAD THE BEST REPRESENTATION I HAVE EVER SEEN. Suck it all of you who keep saying a historian fiction can\'t entail good representation.IN YOUR FACES. We have two main interracial characters. One bisexual character, one lesbian character and one gay character. And these are just the main character. We also got side representation, from not as important characters in the story. This factor upped the story so much to me. We got to see the struggles that POV and gay people used to face in a time like this. We got to see our main character hide her true lineage to rise at the top of Hollywood. We got to see two lovers hiding their true sexuality, hiding their undying love for each other because the world would never understand. The conversations between the characters about homophobia of that time period were heartbreaking. I saw so much of our own time in them. So many things have changed since then in our world, and so many have not. We can see the comparisons from these types of books. And it\'s a reminder of how our society is moving forward of backwards. The representation made this book what it is. If every single character was white and straight, I wouldn\'t have been as awed by this book as I am now. And I am myself, a while straight female. Imagine how important representation is for people who can actually relate to it. I would never understand.This book had so many layers. Everything was thought of and processed. Nothing was sloppy, nothing was lacking meaning. Every single word had its reason to be written. I feel privileged to have had the honor of reading this book. It will stick to me for a very long time. I also enjoyed the little snippets we got from the newspapers. They made the setting all the much more real. The relationships were everything, the friendships, the love stories. Evelyn\'s life is so engaging and complicated, you can\'t get enough of it. We truly see how corrupt the Old Hollywood was. And it makes us think about the New Hollywood. Is it still like this? Is everything we see just a fabricated lie? All the lies the characters came up with, seemed to work. I guess, we can never know what happens between closed doors. But I think the New Hollywood is more sincere. It\'s more about talent, at the most part. I\'d like to hope so.In conclusion, I could rave about this book for days. I have so much to say, I could write a book myself. But I\'m gonna end it here. This book was a present sent to me by God himself. I want to read it again and again and again and absorb its wisdom. This book would be such an amazing source material for a movie adaptation.WE NEED THIS TO HAPPEN. But I\'m scared they would ruin it. I\'m always scared with book to movie adaptations. We all readers are. Anyway, I couldn\'t recommend this enough. It doesn\'t matter if you don\'t read historical fiction or adult,PICK THIS BOOK UP. You won\'t regret it one bit. So, till the next one... K BYE!!!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '‚ÄùEvelyn always leaves you hoping you‚Äôll get just a little bit more. And she always denies you.‚ÄùThis book was so, so, soGOOD!!I swear I was barely two pages in and already knew that I‚Äôd love it with all my heart! <3 There‚Äôs just something about that golden Hollywood era that captivated me right from the beginning and once Evelyn entered the scene I was a goner. I just loved the way her story was told!We didn‚Äôt only get the interviews with Monique but also were able to read news articles about her life and this made everything so much more intriguing. I mean ‚ÄúHollywood Digest‚Äù, ‚ÄúSub Rosa‚Äù or the ‚ÄúNew York Tribune‚Äù, they all wrote about Evelyn‚Äôs life and those articles give an authenticity that makes this book feel real. It could have happened, Evelyn could have been a real Hollywood Star and people could have been as fascinated by her as by Marilyn Monroe or Marlene Dietrich.I think to some degree Taylor Jenkins Reid might have even had Marilyn Monroe in her mind when she wrote Evelyn‚Äôs character and knowing how awesome Marilyn was this really doesn‚Äôt come as a surprise. XD Another thing I appreciated was that every husband got a part of this book and even though there were seven of them, who all influenced Evelyn and left a mark on her character, none of them actually was her one true love. It‚Äôs a very particular approach to a great story and I loved the way it was carried out.Still, after I read the ending my mind was reeling and my feelings were so mixed that I had a tough time coming to terms with everything that was revealed. There were so many things I felt conflicted about and even now, after more than a week has passed, I still didn‚Äôt manage to sort out my feelings and I still don‚Äôt know what to do with them. Maybe I‚Äôll have to get used to the idea that to think about Evelyn Hugo and her seven husbands will always make me feel conflicted and that there‚Äôs no such thing as making peace with an ending like that.And maybe, just maybe, that was Taylor Jenkins Reid‚Äôs plan all along. ;-)The characters:Welcome to my characters section, aka ‚ÄúThe spoilery spoiler zone‚Äù! If you didn‚Äôt read the book yet and still want to be surprised by its revelations you better don‚Äôt continue to read my review. I‚Äôm worse than any tabloid mentioned in this book and I‚Äôll spoil you relentlessly! If you still want to read my gossip, go ahead, but don‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt warn you! ;-PEvelyn Hugo:‚ÄùAnd I didn‚Äôt say I was confessing any sins. To say that what I have to tell is a sin is misleading and hurtful. I don‚Äôt feel regret for the things I‚Äôve done ‚Äì at least, not the things you might expect ‚Äì despite how hard they may have been or how repugnant they may seem in the cold light of day.‚ÄùOh, Evelyn! Where do I even begin? I loved that woman so damn much, I can‚Äôt even! <333 It‚Äôs so rare to meet such a complex character in a book but damn Evelyn just had it all! She was neither white nor black, and if anything she was all different shades of grey. I loved that she was so ruthless, that she did what she had to do in order to get what she wanted, that she was unapologetic about her decisions and behaviour and that she never held back and just wanted it all! Celia was right, at times Evelyn could be really awful and egoistic, but damn did her good qualities make up for it. Compassionate, caring and protective of the ones she loved she would have done everything possible to keep them safe and happy. Gosh,WHAT. A. WOMAN!I think I might be in love with her! <333‚ÄùDid I want to make as much money as Don? Of course I did. I wanted to get the paycheck and mail a copy of it to him with a photo of my middle finger. But mostly I wanted the freedom to do whatever I wanted.‚Äù‚ÄùI told her every single day that her life had been the world‚Äôs greatest gift to me, that I believed I was put on earth not to make movies or wear emerald-green gowns and wave at crowds but to be her mother.‚Äù‚ÄùI regret every second I didn‚Äôt spend with her. I regret every stupid thing I did that caused her an ounce of pain. I should have chased her down the street the day she left me. I should have begged her to stay. I should have apologized and sent roses and stood on top of the Hollywood sign and shouted, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm in love with Celia St. James!‚Äô and let them crucify me for it.‚ÄùCelia St. James:‚ÄùI really like you. I like watching you on-screen. I like how the moment you show up in a scene, I can‚Äôt look at anything else. I like the way your skin is too dark for your blond hair, the way the two shouldn‚Äôt go together and yet seem so natural on you. And to be honest, I like how calculating and awful you kind of are.‚ÄùNow here‚Äôs the thing, I know that Celia was the love of Evelyn‚Äôs life and I could see that they loved each other deeply, but ‚Äì and here comes the hugeBUT‚Äì I had the feeling that I could never truly connect to her. I don‚Äôt know what it was that kept me from adoring her the way I adore Evelyn but I think it might have been the sum of thousands of little things that ultimately left a bad taste in my mouth. For instance I hated that Evelyn always seemed to feel like she had done something wrong and that it was her responsibility to set things right again. I mean Celia threw a lot of awful things at her too, but in the end it always seemed to be Evelyn that blamed herself for it. Also I didn‚Äôt like that Celia wasn‚Äôt only self-righteous but also more than just a little judgemental. You‚Äôd think a person who represents the ‚ÄúL‚Äù in LGBTQ+ would be more accepting and open-minded when her partner is bi, but nope Celia was almost as bi-phobic as the men in Evelyn‚Äôs life and that made me really sad. =(‚ÄùThat was how it was with Celia. When you denied her what she wanted, when you hurt her, she made sure you hurt, too.‚Äù‚ÄùSo I told myself that the spark between Celia and me was just a quirk we had. Which was convincing as long as it remained quirky.Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.‚ÄùHarry Cameron:‚ÄùI want to be with someone I love. I want to have a companion. I‚Äôd like to bring someone home to my family. I don‚Äôt want to live alone anymore. And I want a son or a daughter. We could have that together. I can‚Äôt give you everything. I know that. But I want to raise a family, and I‚Äôd love to raise one with you.‚ÄùAside from Evelyn, Harry Cameron wastruly the best thingabout this entire book! <33 I loved this man so much and I think he‚Äôs an angel! He was always respectful and supportive and even more important he accepted Evelyn exactly the way she was. I loved that he and Evelyn always tried to solve every problem together and I hated to see him so sad after the death of John. T_T Harry‚Äôs grief broke my heart and even though he was drinking way too much he never did anything stupid. I mean he never hurt Evelyn or got frustrated with her, he only tried to compensate his grief without hurting anyone else in the process. Even when it came to this he was considerate and kind. =(( Poor Harry, though. It made me so damn sad that he had to go and I admit it, I actually shed some tears when he died. T_TMonique Grant:‚ÄùWhy, until this moment, did I not realize that the issue is my own confidence? That the root of most of my problems is that I need to be secure enough in who I am to tell anyone who doesn‚Äôt like it to go fuck themselves? Why have I spent so long settling for less when I know damn well the world expects more?‚ÄùTo say their relationship was complicated would be putting it more than just mildly! It was really interesting to see Monique‚Äôs character arc though. I mean at the beginning she was a shy mouse that didn‚Äôt dare to say anything to her boss and by the end of the book she was a young successful woman who stood up for herself and finally had the guts to make decisions she never even dared to consider. I think that to get to know Evelyn and to find out the truth behind her father‚Äôs death was necessary to find her happiness and I‚Äôm convinced that both of those things were able to give her some closure. I could understand her anger towards Evelyn, her hurt when she found out what she had done and the inability to truly hate her for it. Because she got to know the person behind the movie star and she knew how broken Evelyn was on the inside, how much pain she had suffered, how much loss she had endured. =( Still, that scene when she pondered whether to get on the train or not, the thoughts that crossed her mind, her inner struggle how to deal with the situation at hand. Damn, this was one of the best book moments I ever had the pleasure to read. Well done, Taylor Jenkins Reid, well done! I had goose bumps following that inner conflict. *shudders*‚ÄùI‚Äôm Evelyn.‚Äù She reaches out and takes my hand, shaking it. It strikes me as a unique form of power to say your own name when you know that everyone in the room, everyone in the world, already knows it.‚Äù‚ÄùI insist that you be ruthless in your negotiating, Monique. Make them pay you what they would pay a white man. And then, once you‚Äôve done that, every penny from it will be yours.‚ÄùThe relationships & ships:Evelyn & Celia:‚ÄùI wanted to give her a lot of things. I wanted what I had to be hers. I wondered if this was what it felt like to love someone.‚ÄùThose two were the death of me, I swear! Their ups and downs, their struggles and fights, their love and dreams, their hopes and shattered realities. ARGH! It was so obvious they loved each other, yet they could never be together. Because the world didn‚Äôt let them and wouldn‚Äôt have understood, because they didn‚Äôt want the same thing, because they weren‚Äôt ready to be in a relationship and unable to make arrangements. Because‚Ä¶ justBECAUSE!There was always another reason why they couldn‚Äôt be happy, another misunderstanding that tore at their foundations, another bump on the road that caused them to drift apart. They loved and lost and loved and lost again. It was so heart-breaking to watch! And Celia, she killed me. With everything she said to Evelyn! I knew she loved her, yet she hurt her so much! >_< I just wished she would have had more sympathy for Evelyn‚Äôs outlook and I really wish she would have tried to understand Evelyn‚Äôs sexuality. So many of their problems could have been solved, they could have gained so many years if they just would have allowed themselves to be who they are. Their love was so tragic‚Ä¶ more tragic than any of the movies they produced over the years. And it really made me sad. T_T‚ÄùEvelyn, who was your great love? You can tell me.‚ÄùEvelyn looks out the window, breathes in deeply, and then says, ‚ÄúCelia St. James.‚ÄùThe room is quiet as Evelyn lets herself hear her own words. And then she smiles, a bright, wide, deeply sincere smile. She starts laughing to herself and then refocuses on me. ‚ÄúI feel like I spent my entire life loving her.‚Äù‚ÄùIt‚Äôs not wrong,‚Äù Celia said. ‚ÄúIt shouldn‚Äôt be wrong, to love you. How can it be wrong?‚Äù‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not wrong, sweetheart. It‚Äôs not,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre wrong.‚Äù‚ÄùIf you love someone enough, you should be able to overcome anything,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd we have always loved each other so much, more than I ever thought I could be loved, more than I ever thought I could love. So why ‚Ä¶ why couldn‚Äôt we overcome it?‚Äù‚ÄúWe did,‚Äù I said, turning towards her. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here.‚ÄùShe shook her head. ‚ÄúBut the years,‚Äù she said.‚ÄùThere‚Äôs a difference between sexuality and sex. I used sex to get what I wanted. Sex is just an act. Sexuality is a sincere expression of desire and pleasure. That I always kept for Celia.‚ÄùEvelyn & Harry:‚ÄùYou do not know how fast you have been running, how hard you have been working, how truly exhausted you are, until someone stands behind you and says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs OK, you can fall down now. I‚Äôll catch you.‚ÄùSo I fell down.And Harry caught me.Their friendship was everything, absolutelyE.V.E.R.Y.T.H.I.N.G.!!!Gosh, I loved their relationship so much, I can‚Äôt even!!! They were so perfect together and understood each other better than anyone else. They were so close it sometimes felt like they could read each other‚Äôs mind and I think of all the husbands Evelyn married over the years, Harry definitely was the best! <333 (Of course her last hubby was awesome too but if you ask me no one was able to hold a candle to Harry!) I know Harry was gay and had no sexual desire for women and I know that Evelyn loved Celia but damn those two made so much sense! They shared a love that is sometimes even harder to find than the once in a lifetime love we all crave for and they were so much more than just friends. They were business partners, equals, best friends, partners in crime, confidants, soul mates and kindred spirits. And most importantly, they loved each other deeply! <333 It‚Äôs so rare to find a friend like that, so rare to have a connection like that, to be loved liked that‚Ä¶ ARGH! I justLOVEDthem!!! This was such a wholesome representation of a deep friendship and I‚Äôm incapable to put it into words. *breaks down and sobs*‚ÄùI promise I‚Äôll do whatever I can. I promise you we will figure this out.‚Äù‚ÄúOK,‚Äù Harry said, and then he squeezed my hand back and walked out the door. ‚ÄúWe will figure this out.‚Äù‚ÄùI want you to stay, Harry. We need you. Me and Connor.‚Äù I grabbed his hand tighter. ‚ÄúBut if you have to go, then go. Go if it hurts. Go if it‚Äôs time. Just go knowing you were loved, that I will never forget you, that you will live in everything Connor and I do. Go knowing I love you purely, Harry, that you were an amazing father. Go knowing I told you all my secrets. Because you were my best friend.‚ÄùThe bi rep:‚ÄùIt really makes you think, doesn‚Äôt it? That people were so eager to believe we were swapping spouses but would have been scandalized to know we were monogamous and queer?‚ÄùAnd now we finally come to one of the most important subjects of this book: The bi rep! And let me tell you, it was spot-on! Evelyn is a bi icon and for the rest of my life I‚Äôll never get tired of emphasizing how important this kind of representation is! Throughout the entire book Evelyn is confronted with bi-phobia but she always took it in stride! She accepted herself the way she was and she did an amazing job at trying to explain her sexuality. I know some of you might say that it shouldn‚Äôt even be necessary to explain your sexuality to others and I‚Äôm inclined to agree, but the bitter truth is that we have to explain it no matter if we want to or not. I can only speak from personal experience here but usually straight people have a hard time understanding how you can love both sexes equally and make no difference, while lesbian or gay people might just try to label you as one of their own. What Celia did?! It happens! It happens way too often and even though her actions and behaviour left a bitter taste in my mouth it still represented one of the many facets of reality. I loved the way Taylor Jenkins Reid gave Evelyn a voice though. Evelyn Hugo didn‚Äôt accept those prejudices, nope, she gave us her honest opinion, her point of view and made the other characters acknowledge her for who she was! And this was wholesome and healthy and might help a lot of people to accept themselves! So thank you Taylor Jenkins Reid! Thank you very much! <333‚ÄùBeing bisexual didn‚Äôt make me disloyal,‚Äù Evelyn says. ‚ÄúOne has nothing to do with the other. Nor did it mean that Celia could only fulfil half my needs.‚Äù‚ÄùI hated being called a lesbian. Not because I thought there was anything wrong with loving a woman, mind you. No, I‚Äôd come to terms with that a long time ago. But Celia only saw things in black and white. She liked women and only women. And I liked her. And so she often denied the rest of me.‚Äù‚ÄùWow,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIncredible. I married a dyke.‚Äù‚ÄúStop saying that,‚Äù I said.‚ÄúEvelyn, if you have sex with women, you are a lesbian. Don‚Äôt be a self-hating lesbian. That‚Äôs not‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not becoming.‚ÄùMy conclusion:The more I think about this book, the more I love it! This is such an important read! I know Reid tackled a lot of problematic topics in this book, but she did it in such a positive and sensible way that I‚Äôm convinced everyone who reads‚ÄúThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo‚Äùwill learn something good from it! I‚Äôm usually not the kind of person who throws a book at you and says you should read it but in all seriousness: Read this one! Live and suffer with Evelyn, enjoy her good moments and cry with her when the world throws her for a loop! Hate her, love her, accept her the way she is. And most importantly, learn from her mistakes and don‚Äôt hesitate to show the world your true self. ;-)I know this review has been already way too long but I still want to thank the ever charmingAshleyfor this wonderful buddy read! We both didn‚Äôt have it easy while reading this book together, but we always managed to find a compromise and were able to continue once our lives started to become a little less hectic. *lol* I‚Äôm glad we could read this together and I hope sooner or later we‚Äôll find another book to buddy read again! =)'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '‚û∏4.5 stars‚û∑ the seven husbands of evelyn hugo by taylor jenkins reid is a captivating novel that delves into the glamorous and tumultuous life of the enigmatic hollywood icon, evelyn hugo. the story is narrated by monique grant, a young journalist who is given the exclusive opportunity to interview evelyn hugo, now in her late seventies, about her legendary career and her seven marriages and tumultuous relationships that shaped her career and personal life. as monique delves deeper into evelyn‚Äôs story, she uncovers shocking revelations that force her to confront her own past and identity.‚Äî this book honestly surpassed my expectations. i‚Äôm always a bit iffy about reading popular books, but i absolutely loved this story! i honestly did not expect it to make me cry so much, seriously this book had no right ripping my heart out into tiny little pieces. i don‚Äôt even think this was supposed to be an emotional read but my heart just broke for these characters and how they weren‚Äôt allowed to love whoever they wanted. i grew so attached to these characters and parting ways with them was such a tragedy to me lmaoo. evelyn, celia, harry and john are truly my little family. i should‚Äôve closed the book after the picnic scene and just pretended that they all lived happily ever after üò≠üíîtjr‚Äôs writing style is just mesmerising. she has this incredible ability for drawing you into her stories with such vivid detail that you feel like you‚Äôre right there in the moment, experiencing everything alongside her characters. this story transports us back into old hollywood and it makes me feel like i‚Äôm immersed into the glitz and glamour of the ‚Äò50s and ‚Äò60s silver screen.psa: mick riva needs his own tw. i‚Äôm so tired of having to see that deadbeat‚Äôs name!! he is a jump scare at this point.‚û≥evelyn hugo:‚Äúi‚Äôm bisexual, don‚Äôt ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box.‚Äùshe‚Äôs an icon, she‚Äôs a legend and she is the moment. she‚Äôs so effortlessly glamorous, she‚Äôs brilliant and powerful but that doesn‚Äôt mean she is a good person ‚Äî but she‚Äôs not an unlikeable character. i understand all the decisions and sacrifices she had to make to get to where she is in life. she done some horrible things, but she would NEVER take them back because she only wanted to protect the people she loved the most. she is a flawed character, she‚Äôs ruthless, selfish, manipulative and she is unapologetic about her life choices and wasn‚Äôt afraid to use her body to get important roles. evelyn always has to get her own way but that made me love her even more and what gave her so much depth. she lived her life the best way she could. she had a dream she was determined to fulfil and she knew what she had to do to make her dream a reality.‚û≥celia st. james:‚Äúall i‚Äôve ever wanted was for you to be truly mine. but you‚Äôve never been mine. not really. i‚Äôve always had to settle for one piece of you. while the world gets the other half. i don‚Äôt blame you. it doesn‚Äôt make me stop loving you. but i can‚Äôt do it. i can‚Äôt do it, evelyn.‚ÄùSCREAMING, CRYING, THROWING UP!!

I knew this reveal going in and do not believe knowing this reveal hurts the reading experience.I think a lot about the idea of love as something dangerous, as something that you have to fight for. And it's only recently that I've decided that's something that probably has to do with loving women. I have been very lucky, in growing up in liberal California and in the 2000s. But I received marriage rights in my country four months after realizing I liked girls, and in reading about the past and thinking about the past, I am constantly, daily, reminded how being born ten years earlier would have made everything that much more dangerous, that much more violent, that much more fearful.And there is something so woefully romantic to me about the fact that there were people who braved that climate and loved anyway and paved the path, while doing so, for me and so many others.So that's all to say that this book made me experience all five stages of grief and simultaneously made me feel every positive emotion in the world and I have no idea how that is possible. but listen, if you only read one book I recommend you this year, I want it to be this one.‚ÄúMake them pay you as much as they would a white man.‚ÄùThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugois, yeah, about the seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo. Seven husbands who are sometimes awful and sometimes sympathetic and sometimes somewhere in between. Ernie, who she used to get to where she is, Don, who beat her till she barely knew whether to continue, Harry, who she loved more than any of them, Max, who loves the idea of her more than he could ever love her.But I think, despite its marketing, this book is really about Evelyn.Awful, complicated, completely lovable Evelyn. Evelyn is a flawed, compelling, brave, ambitious woman who got to where she was with teeth and claws and never gave up. She is also, and I‚Äôm not even joking, one of the most iconic characters I have ever had the pleasure of reading about. She is a woman with a lot of ambition but also one who loves and wants to be loved. She issucha good character.This book is also fiercely and unapologetically socio-political and Ilovethat. Evelyn‚Äôs story is one of being a woman in a man‚Äôs world. It is one of being a Cuban woman in a white woman‚Äôs world. It is one of being a bisexual woman in an era where attraction to women was demonized by the whole culture. It is one of hiding yourself for ambition, one of trying to decide which one takes precedent, one of aging, and one of never knowing whether your choices wereright.Annnnnnnd this book also has the most fucking heartbreaking romantic relationship I have had the displeasure to read about in my entire life. I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if romantic relationships should be considered spoilers, but‚Ä¶ well, I knew going in who the actual love of Evelyn‚Äôs life was and it STILL WORKED FOR ME. So here it is: Evelyn Hugo and Celia St. James are one of my favorite fictional relationships, of all time, ever. These two have a complicated, flawed, at times tumultous relationship, and yet they love each other so much, always.‚ÄúPeople think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.‚ÄùAnd perhaps my favorite part was the messaging around the importance of actual love in relationships, rather than just a willingness to try.‚ÄúYou didn't come here and tell me how much you miss me. Or how hard it has been to live without me. You said you didn't want to give up. And I don't want to give up, either. I don't want to fail at this. But that's not actually a great reason to stay together. We should have reasonswhywe don't want to give. It shouldn't just bethatwe don't want to give up. And I don't... have any.‚ÄúYou have never felt like my other half.‚ÄùI know I‚Äôve talked about a lot of specific things in the book, but I don‚Äôt know exactly how to put into words what this bookmeantto me. You can almost feel how much Taylor Jenkins Reidfeltthis book.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugoleft me an emotional mess, but also ahappymess. All I know is I feel ruined for any other book, and I want you to be as well.Blog|Goodreads|Twitter|Youtube""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""CLICK HERE for a Booktube Videoabout:Ten Fabulous Book Reviews and One That Will Make You Go -doesn't that belong to Miranda Reads?Now that you know this one made the list check the video review to see the rest (and find the stolen surprise)!The Written Review3.75 starsHeartbreak is a loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.Evelyn Hugo was the star of the century.She dominated the big screen for more than four decades. Every man wanted her and every woman wanted to be her.Perhaps most famously, Evelyn Hugo wasmarried seven times.Each divorce only increased her fame.Rumors swept through the tabloids like wildfire.I‚Äôm under absolutely no obligation to make sense to you.And now, age 79, Evelyn Hugo decided to auction off her mostwildly famous gownsand offered one lucky journalist (Monique) an interview that will last a lifetime.However, Monique soon learns that this is beyond a two-page spread. Evelyn Hugo is offering a tell-all - a full biography - that promises to be the mostscandalous and salaciousthing that has ever graced this world.Monique would be a fool - an absolute fool - to pass this up. But the thought, the 'it's too good to be true' sort of thought, continues to replay in her mind.Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.Overall, this one was good but I was never wowed.Everyone and their mother was talking up this book and while I agree that it is engaging and scandalous (in a good way)...I don't know.I just expected more from it.I definitely think it was well-written...just a bit dull in areas.We start the book with 40 pages of just talking up Evelyn Hugo and it really did drag. There's only so many times I can hear about howwonderful and stunninga person is before it gets boring.I think if more of the marriages were teased in the beginning - just to give the audience a taste of the mystery surrounding her love life (rather than going on and on about how intriguing it was...without telling us what was intriguing about it) would have helped significantly.Once we got to her life, the book certainly picked up.I really lovedhow Evelyn's sexuality was portrayedin this book. I liked watching her grow as a person - from a teenager using sex to get herself out of a hellhole to falling in love and finding it something to be cherished.Her love forCeliathroughout the years truly made thiswildly unbelievable story cinchfor me. Honestly,her relationship with CeliaTheir love was expertly done, with all of the fear and paranoia associated with the times, that it truly felt like real life.Ultimately, this was an enjoyable read, a bit slow paced, but enjoyable nonetheless!Never let anyone make you feel ordinary.YouTube|Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Facebook| Snapchat @miranda_reads""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""WOW I NEVER POSTED THIS. What a pleasant surprise! After dozens of unposted-unwritten reviews, finally an unposted-but-written one. Life is beautiful.But first off (I can call this first off if I freaking want to!!!) I wanna say: DON‚ÄôT LET ANYONE TELL YOU THAT HISTORICAL FICTION CAN‚ÄôT BE DIVERSE. Tell that anthropomorphized tennis ball they‚Äôre either uncreative or a secret bigot or a full-on dunce or ALL THREE. Because this book pulls it off with more than a tablespoon of grace, I‚Äôll tell you that.My guy, there aren‚Äôt even that many characters in this book. And we‚Äôre following the majority of them starting in the 1950s. Not exactly, y‚Äôknow, the peak of support for diversity in America. AND STILL WE DON‚ÄôT LACK FOR REPRESENTATION. Do you get how great that is? I‚Äôm ready to punch the whitesplainers of Disney‚Äôs Frozen in their boring pale faces. The word ‚ÄúFrozen‚Äù is actually a reference to the lack of movement in the creativity centers of their brains. (Follow for more behind the scenes Disney-Pixar facts.)This book includes three (three!) interracial relationships. Actually, it‚Äôs more like ten if you count the fact that our protagonist is Latina. Yes! This may be the bare minimum, but I‚Äôm so used to YA wherein one pale as snow teen romances a - gasp - pale aspaperteen! Diversity in young adult books = one character is of Western European descent and the other Eastern European. Talk about a vanilla romance. (Buh dum ch.)This book proves how important it is to provide diversity. The difference in the believability and intricacy of the story is incredible.I will say we don‚Äôt often get a good look at the variance in culture that comes with diversity here. Evelyn Hugo, though the daughter of Cuban immigrants, purposefully represses her heritage in order to fit in with the whitewashed 1950s and ‚Äô60s cinema scene. Our narrator, though half-black, expresses a fear that someone will tell her she‚Äôs ‚Äúnot black enough.‚Äù I wish the ethnic diversity played a little more into the text, but it didn‚Äôt feel unrealistic or anything. The reasoning was explained.But there‚Äôs even more diversity. Like, it gets even better. Because, again, despite the time setting, this book contains A SH*T TON of LGBT+ rep. And these are some of the most beautifully portrayed LGBT+ relationships I‚Äôve ever read. If you don‚Äôt read this book for anything else, read it for that fine-ass inclusion, boi.Beyond that, this is the ultimate guilty pleasure book. IT IS SO FUN READING ABOUT OLD HOLLYWOOD AND OLD MOVIES. I wanted to watch the entire Evelyn Hugo canon after this, and then it was like, oh wait, she‚Äôs not real.I don‚Äôt have much else to say. This is chick-lit-y historical fiction at its finest. It‚Äôs just so fun. Some people say they got bored halfway through, and I get why you could, but I didn‚Äôt. I really fell in love with the world of this book, and the depiction of Old Hollywood, and all that jazz.A lot is revealed over the course of the book, and the best part is just being surprised at each twist and turn, so I don‚Äôt want to go to specifics even a little. I‚Äôm just going to cut off this review here before I risk, like, accidentally mentioning that Evelyn Hugo‚Äôs third husband turned her into a vampire and she was a vampire the whole time and she turns Monique at the end of the book.*Damn it!Bottom line: This is very fun and cool and maybe even important. Read it!!!*This isn‚Äôt true, by the way. Duh.----------------------rereading updateswas tempted to spend my whole day watching old movies and not reading at all.compromised by rereading this instead.this was a very good plan.----------------------pre-reviewThis book? It's really great.I got a hell of a lot more than I bargained for.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""This right here. This is why I read. For the joy and privilege of coming across an exquisite story like this and being swept up in its magic.CouldThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugoreally be fiction, dreamt up entirely in Taylor Jenkins Reid's mind? Every moment felt so real, so tangible. When I reached the end, it was hard to let go, hard to return to a world where this was nothing more than a figment of the imagination.Evelyn Hugo, revered Hollywood actress and icon, is finally ready to tell the story of her life. But she wants to make sure that whatever comes out is authentic to who she is. So she contacts Monique Grant, a mostly unknown writer, to be her scribe. Everyone is surprised by the choice, no one more so than Monique herself. But to be given the chance to write Evelyn's memoir and to understand the person behind the legend is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, one that Monique can't pass up.When I first started this, I thought I was in for a fluffy, gossipy romance set in the golden Hollywood era. After all, why would anyone need so many husbands unless one was in it for a good time? But this turned out to be so much more. At its heart, it's a stunning and brutally honest portrayal of love in all its different forms. It shows not just the joy of love, but also its sacrifices and heartbreaks.I was blown away by how complex of a character Evelyn Hugo is. She is the heart and soul of this story, and her character shines so bright, it's hard to look away. She feels real, coming off the pages wholly formed. She's not perfect. In fact, her flaws and numerous questionable actions make her human, and it's easy to relate to her and cheer for her.The book is written in alternative viewpoints, a little bit from Monique's perspective as she interviews Evelyn and a lot from Evelyn's perspective as she shares the story of her life. When a book has two different viewpoints, there's always a fear that one is more interesting than the other. But not here. I can honestly say that every moment of this book was equally riveting.I adored Reid's writing style. It's filled with so much charm that it just oozes off the pages. The story obviously tackles serious issues, but the writing never takes itself too seriously. It's witty and funny, drawing me in and making me feel every emotion. It manages to convey so much nuance without ever slowing down the pacing or seeming long-winded. I'm in awe.You guys know I'm a romantic through and through. And this story is all about finding and holding on to that great love of your life, no matter what it takes. I mean, how could I not be drawn to that? I'm also a realist and I know that love takes so much sacrifice. So this story spoke to my heart and my mind.I never really had a chance. This book had me good and hooked, right from the first page. It's the sort of story I know I'll come back to again and again, savoring it anew every time.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:Carrie Soto Is BackDaisy Jones & The SixMalibu Rising~~~~~~~~~~~~‚úßConnect with me‚úßInstagram‚úßThis was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

It's not the kind of thing I usually pick up, and I haven't read anything by Reid before. But something about it intrigued me. So I checked out the kindle sample. Just a couple chapters, I figured, because I probably wouldn't like it anyway.And I was HOOKED.It's perfect, easy beach read material. It's not particularly deep, it does not take the genre to new levels or make you think about something new, and yet it DID feel different. Evelyn Hugo's story was sodelicious and compellingthat it stood out, and kept me turning pages in a desperate need to discover the stories behind her seven husbands, and the answer to the one question everyone wants to know: who was her greatest love?The framing of the story reminded me a lot ofThe Thirteenth Tale. Like that book, inThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, a young woman - this time an ambitious journalist called Monique Grant - goes to interview an elderly woman. UnlikeThe Thirteenth Tale, this elderly woman happens to be one of the most famous actresses in the world.Evelyn Hugo has lived a life in the public eye, but she is full of secrets. Only she knows what happened behind the scenes in her long career of scandals and highly-publicized heartbreaks. Just like the fictional world of the book longed to know the truth-- so did I. Reid and Evelyn's habit of giving you just enough to leave you wanting more was incredibly exciting. Throughout, we are encouraged to wonder why someone like Evelyn Hugo would specifically request a relatively-inexperienced journalist like Monique. Why Monique? What is Evelyn hiding?The more I got to know Evelyn, the more I fell in love with her. She has made a lot of controversial decisions during her career, but she knows it and she also knows she'd probably do it all again. She's played the Hollywood game, dated famous men to further her career, and used her body to get what she wants. She has experienced the full force of the industry's sexism and, in some ways, capitalized on it. She is deeply flawed and aware of it. She has traded important aspects of her identity for more fame, more roles, more money. She was a badass Cuban woman working in an industry that didn't like women to be badass or Cuban. She manipulated and she lied.Despite everything - and because of it - I liked her.I stayed fully engrossed in the story of Evelyn Hugo - and of Monique Grant - from the opening chapters when Evelyn demanded an interview with only Monique, through decades of Hollywood in all its shimmering ugliness, right until the ending's final reveals.I enjoyed every moment.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Best rereading choice for flashback Saturday is re-devouring my all time favorite TJR book!Evelyn Hugo a. k. a. Evelyn Elena Herrera is one of the most portrayed characters, a daughter of Cuban immigrants, raised in poverty. She‚Äôs not only beautiful, alluring but there‚Äôs something different about her: her energy is vivid, radiating. She knows what she wants for her life and she‚Äôs competitive and determined enough how she may get it by leaving her life in Hell‚Äôs Kitchen and moving to Los Angeles to become one of the movie stars, dying her hair, exposing her slender body, looking directly at the camera with her almond shaped eyes under her long lashes till the director tells her ‚Äúcut‚Äù.Now she‚Äôs 79, married SEVEN TIMES, a Hollywood legend, ready to share her life story and scandalous secret she kept for years. She befriends 35 years old Monique Grant, an unknown reporter works for ‚ÄúVivant‚Äù in Los Angeles. Even the boss of Monique has no clue why this Hollywood legend demanded to work with her: she could choose someone more experienced, popular, known in the industry.So many question balloons start to fly above our heads:- Why Evelyn wants to talk only Monique and if she doesn‚Äôt, the memoir deal will be off?- Why Evelyn married seven times. Did she love any of her husbands? Does she have resentments? Does she suffer from heartbreak? Which one of is the love of her life?-As soon as their interview starts, Evelyn takes her an adventurous train ride with full of juicy, entertaining, heartbreaking, emotional stories starting from glamorous 60‚Äôs of La La Land, the productions of her famous movies, how her path crossed with those men, how she saved them and they saved her, how she got hurt, how she shone, how she burned‚Ä¶ and eventually a big secret reveals about her life story which will change everything about true identity of Evelyn and the life choices she‚Äôs made!It‚Äôs brilliant!

It is a favorite of the year, it will be a favorite of all time. I am wholly enchanted byThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugoand I will never forget how much I adore this book.CW: domestic abuse, death/grief, homophobia/biphobia, racismabortion & suicideAdult fiction is not typically my cup of tea, especially a combination of historical fiction and contemporary with the amount of long flashbacks (flashbacks: ALSO NOT MY THING). I have no idea how this combination of literary elements I typically do not like consumed my entire being, but it did. Taylor Jenkins Reid is an immensely talented author. Her prose is beautiful, vivid, and descriptive. There isn‚Äôt a moment throughout this story where I was bored or underwhelmed. Every second of this book is completely engaging ‚Äì it was a huge struggle to put the book down.Evelyn Hugo is one of the greatest literary characters I have ever had the pleasure to read from. The exploration of her Cuban heritage and bisexuality is fascinating, especially given the era and her celebrity status. She is one of those intoxicating characters you will never be able to purge from your mind with her strong will, her independence, her strength, her cunning, and her compassion. Evelyn Hugo is unforgettable in my mind and hearing her story was one of the greatest pleasures I think I have ever experienced as a reader.Personally, I didn‚Äôt LOVE Monique, though I am always happy to see another biracial main character in literature. I appreciated her contribution to the story as I feel the book would lose some of it‚Äôs strength if there was not another character for Evelyn to explain her actions and motivations to and it was just her story, but it‚Äôs for that reason that I sometimes felt she was more of a plot device than an individual character. Compared to Evelyn, I just did not care for Monique‚Äôs individual life and problems. I enjoyed seeing how Evelyn influenced her life, but her storyline was so drab compared to Evelyn. Edit 4/3/2019 - After a second read, I GREATLY appreciate Monique. Her character is so nuanced and necessary to the story. I totally relinquish much of my initial feelings on her.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugois one of my favorite books OF ALL TIME. I will never forget how in love I am with this story and all the ways it has affected me.

This book came in and knocked me off my feet.Monique is working for Vivant, a media company, when she is requested to interview Evelyn Hugo, a very famous movie actress, who has refused to give interviews for years. Evelyn starts to reveal her story to Monique, that life isn\'t perfect, that people are more than just one thing, that relationships are complicated, the power of forgiveness and reinvention, the idea of family, loss, and accepting the choices of others.This book had such depth and tackled so many issues. One of them was the concept of divorce. Growing up in a Baptist church, divorce was viewed as the ultimate sin. As soon as anyone heard that someone was divorced, they had a permanent scarlet letter attached to them. However, as I matured, life isn\'t nearly as black and white. Do you really know what happened? Did the man beat this woman and then run off with all of the money, just to teach her a lesson? Why does society still think it is OK to stigmatize divorced people?There were a tremendous amounts of very quotable quotes, and this was one of those rare books that you hope never has to end.""There are people who see a beautiful flower and rush over to pick it.""This book also tackled some of the issues that women face. ""Oh, I know the whole world prefers a woman who doesn\'t know her power, but I\'m sick of all that."" ""People don\'t find it very sympathetic or enduring, a woman who puts herself first.""Overall, this is definitely one of the best books that I have ever read.2025 Reading ScheduleJan\tA Town Like AliceFeb\tBirdsongMar\tCaptain Corelli\'s Mandolin - Louis De BerniereApr\tWar and PeaceMay\tThe Woman in WhiteJun\tAtonementJul\tThe Shadow of the WindAug\tJude the ObscureSep\tUlyssesOct\tVanity FairNov\tA Fine BalanceDec\tGerminalConnect With Me!BlogTwitterBookTubeInstaMy Bookstore at Pango'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""At least I know why Evelyn recruited Monique, the worst journalist of the year, to write her biography.

It reminded me of the family sagas of the yore, kind of likeThe Thorn Birds. Only this book needed another 300 pages to dig deeper into the dramas of Evelyn's life and her psyche. I was entertained by the events of Hugo's Hollywood adventures, but ultimately this book lacks depth. Nobody else noticed how superficial everything is in this novel - relationships, emotions, portrayals of race and queerness?The novel is framed as a biography written by a talented up-and-coming jornalist, but reads as if thrown together by an employee of a gossip rag, who included all of the salacious parts of a famous person's life, but none of that person's interiority.Totally see why it's a bestseller.

I hated every single character with the exception of maybe one but even he turned out to be a huge disappointment eventually. The plot was both simplistic yet beyond difficult to believe.

One major plot point had me eye rolling so hard I was convinced I would have a stroke. I also really, really, really disliked the main romance.

What does she have for someone like the legend Evelyn Hugo wants her to write a book about her life? That\'s the interesting part.So, Monique goes to Evelyn\'s aparment and listens her story. From how Evelyn lost her mother and how she swored she would get out of Hell\'s Kitchen, away from her father and poverty, and because her mother dreamt with became someone famous and live in Hollywood one day. She was born Evelyn Elena Herrera, daughter of Cuban parents, but had to change her name by Evelyn Hugo.She talks about how she made her way to L.A, how much she sacrificed and her husbands, of course.My 3 favorite husbands are: Rex North (he was one of my 3 favorite marriages) to get more money for the movie their starring: Anna Karenina (the gods know how I much love Anna Karenina, so I\'d have given my kidney or soul to see that movie).

I don't think I've ever had as immediate a reaction as I did to reading this book. I feel like my updates have made my distaste for this book pretty evident, but in case it wasn't I'm going to walk through all the things I hated about this book one final time before I try and put as much space between me and this work of fiction as humanly possible.I knew going into the book that Evelyn Hugo was a Latinx character, it wasn't until I started reading though that I discovered our other narrator, Monique, was also a woman of color. [ Don't call her black though, she's biracial. ] And almost immediately I was uncomfortable with this ide. That said I carried on thinking that I was probably just stretching, reaching for things that weren't there. That said I think that the narrative utterly fails at the nuance necessary to tell the story of a Cuban-American finding success in the 50s. Utterly fails to depict the nuance in the way that someone like Evelyn would have to navigate the world, or how her racial identity would have had an impact on most of the things she experienced in life. It's really only brought up at the beginning when she's initially denied roles and Evelyn immediately pivots into this racially ambiguous/spicy white category that she's happy with becuase it ensures her success. That doesn't stop her from later bing mad that her maid doesn't know she's Cuban even though she's actively tried to supress that side of her for literally decades. I won't even get into how the narrative makes Evelyn retiring to Spain to make tortillas her reconnecting with her Cuban roots or how Monique actively distances heself from blackness while never questioning the impact that being raised by a single white mother following the death of her black father might have any role in that. You really mean to tell me that she has memories of her father but not his family? That the first black person she met was a girl in elementary school? Okay. Sidenote Evelyn just randomly dropping that she supported civil rights and MLK Jr towards the end of the book felt totally out of place and while not a big deal that part of the book felt very disconnected from what else was going on.I didn't feel attached to any of the characters really, let alone any of the seven husbands. I have ones I thought were more interesting, but that's only because so did TJR and they were the ones given more time on the page. None of the characters that appear in the novel though are nearly as developed as Evelyn Hugo, something that I think makes it easier for a reader to be drawn to. There is literally no one else. No one is given the time or energy, even the major players in her life. I didn't think that the love story between Evelyn and the person that would be the lover her life was all that compelling if anything I thought that that person was actually lowkey terrible and the romance they shared was almost certainly nothing to write home about.There are a number of deaths in this book, and again, didn't care about any of them.At the end of the day though I did enjoy the voice of Evelyn Hugo, the character to be clear. Though the most revolutionary thing about her is being a bisexual character in their 70s, there's just something about characters like Evelyn that I will always support and that's no different here. Again though it helps that Evelyn is easily the only character crafted with any kind of depth.I can't in good faith recommend that anyone read this book. I got very little enjoyment, but also there is nothing to gain? I realize and appreciate that my thoughts are in the minority here and I in no way feel like my opinion will ever be the one most agree with. If you do decide to pick this up I hope that you are able to enjoy it in ways I couldn't.Also just a warning but this book details incestuous thoughts of child sexual assault, actual child sexual assault/pedophilia, and abuse in general [ definitely physical, emotional up for discussion I'd say ] so just know that if you want to pick this up.2022 re-read thoughtsI wish that I could say that I liked this more the second time, but that would be a lie...Or at least, partly a lie. I don't think that I can raise the rating even if I objectively had a better time reading it knowing the full scope of the story I was going to be getting. Maybe the gut punch of the end of the book being so insensitive being taken out of the equation was enough for me to have a better time, I don't know.I do think that there are elements that work well here. I still think that Evelyn is an interesting character to follow with a very distinctive voice that I would appreciate in the hands of any other author. I feel comfortable saying that because I have enjoyed many a character that share her achetype.For me the ways that race were handled poorly weren't so glaringly annoying this time as much as Celia being a horrible character. From the microaggressions at the first time she and Evelyn have a meal together to the way that she acts for years toward Evelyn. It never comes across as a 'good for her' moment, her standing up for herself... but as shaming Evelyn for doing things that she herself is not doing? Shaming Evelyn for making choices that are good for both of them. I get that communication is hard... but Celia and Evelyn take this to a whole new level. It was childish. It didn't serve love of her life... It didn't serve the one that got away. I deserved better as a reader quite frankly.All of that is to say that the book giving 20ish pages to the explanation as to why Monique was chosen for this opportunity... still by far the worst part of the book. Everything about that getting wrapped up is so rushed. While the whole book feels very surface level, that in particular is damn near unforgivable. Monique deserved better as a character, the readers deserves more, and that TJR thought it was acceptable is pure foolishness.I still think everyone who has wanted to read this has read it at this point... But it really shouldn't be on anyone's tbr. It's definitely not worth the time, even with all the potential this story has.""}]"

In exchange for his help, he asks for three kisses, to be given at the time and place of his choosing.But after Evangeline‚Äôs first promised kiss, she learns that bargaining with an immortal is a dangerous game‚Äîand that the Prince of Hearts wants far more from her than she‚Äôd pledged. He has plans for Evangeline, plans that will either end in the greatest happily ever after or the most exquisite tragedy...","[{'rating': 1, 'content': ""To put it simply,Once Upon a Broken Heartis a hot mess. The premise promises a fairytale, but what Garber delivers is a confused nightmare. With an annoyingly-na√Øve protagonist, a one-dimensional cast of supporting characters and a truly ‚Äúwhat the fuck‚Äù-inducing plot, this book‚Äôs only saving graces are the short chapters and fast pacing, which at times can too be a hindrance to your enjoyment and desire to rate this book higher than you actually will.The beginning chapters of this book are the only thing that delivers on the premise. With vivid imagery, they instantly drew me in and I could see the improvement in Garber‚Äôs writing from the six (boring) chapters I had read ofCaraval. (As you can guess, that didn‚Äôt last very long).Once Upon a Broken Heartfollows rose gold-haired Evangeline Fox, whose stepsister is set to marry Luc, her one true love. Believing Luc to be cursed and desperate to stop the wedding, she enlists the help of Jacks, a Fate and the Prince of Hearts. He agrees to do so under the condition that Evangeline will kiss 3 people of his choosing, but doesn‚Äôt say any more than that. Willing to do whatever it takes to stop Luc marrying Marisol, she agrees to the deal but the wedding is stopped by Jacks turning everyone to stone. It is here that Evangeline first displays her wishy-washy personality, as she regrets her actions and drinks the poison that turned the bride, groom and wedding guests to stone ‚Äì thereby taking their place.Evangeline, as a protagonist and narrator, frustrated me endlessly. She‚Äôsinsanelyna√Øve, always trusting people she shouldn‚Äôt and wanting to help Marisol (her stepsister) when it‚Äôsvery obviousthat a) her sister is shady and up to no good and b) she generally has no reason to. The two of them have next to no relationship, but because Evangeline is so Wonderful and Perfect and Special Because She Has Pink Hair, of course she has to want to help. She‚Äôs also a very passive character: things happentoher, notbecauseof her. Now, I know what you‚Äôre probably thinking: ‚ÄúCharacters are allowed to be na√Øve! It‚Äôs part of their growth!‚Äù or ‚ÄúCharacters are allowed to be nice! They don‚Äôt all have to be sword-wielding assassins or (insert other character trope here)‚Äù. Trust me, I hear you, but there‚Äôs a difference betweenthose charactersand Evangeline Fox.The side characters ‚Äì yes, including Jacks ‚Äì in this book are no better. They‚Äôre all one-dimensional and flat, having one ‚Äòunique‚Äô aspect about them‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs it. I could tell you hardly anything about them. Jacks‚Äô past with Donatella is briefly mentioned, but I wouldn‚Äôt really class that as him having personality, and I think it‚Äôs more fanservice for existingCaravalfans than anything.I can separate this book into two parts: Before Evangeline Drinks the Poison and After Evangeline Drinks the Poison. I enjoyed the Before part, as After Evangeline Drinks the Poison is where Stephanie Garber seems to have forgotten the novel she promised to readers, and began writing something else entirely. Ergo, the plot had gone haywire.The book‚Äôs plot follows no clear structure; it‚Äôs all over the place. Sure, there‚Äôs a little bit of ‚Äúaction‚Äù but that does nothing to redeem a story that is 99% Boring and 1% Interesting Scenes. There were numerous attempts at romantic scenes throughout the book, but Evangeline has no real chemistry with either of her potential love interests (one of them is literally cursed to be in love with her, so there‚Äôs that), so it did nothing for me and I skim-read most of them.Once Upon a Broken Hearttook an extremely bizarre turn after the introduction of vampires. Yes, you read that correctly. Vampires. What the fuck are vampires doing in this book? It was so completely and utterly random, I was honestly thinking ‚Äòwhat was Stephanie Garber on when she wrote this?‚Äô while reading. We were given no real explanation as to why vampires were included either. It was like a complete abuse of authorial power on Garber‚Äôs part: she thought vampires were cool, soshe just put them in the book, with no real thought as to the sense (or lack thereof) it would make. And trust me, it madezero sense. Unfortunately, around the last third of the book and its ‚Äúplot‚Äù hinges on vampires, so there wasn‚Äôt any escaping them.There was also a prophecy subplot, becauseof course there was. The prophecy in this book centres around the Valory Arch, a mysterious archway in The North which contains either treasure and secrets or deadly monsters (no one is really sure which). Evangeline, having such Main Character Energy, is the key to unlocking this arch/doorway (I get she literally IS the main character, but just roll with the punches here). I say it‚Äôs a subplot, but I honestly couldn‚Äôt tell you what was the main plot and what were subplots in this book. Garber weaved a lot of threads throughoutOnce Upon a Broken Heart, and they got tangled up at times.As a ‚Äòminor‚Äô complaint, a lot is told to readers and not shown. For instance, after Evangeline has just woken up from being poisoned, she is told of a Week of Terrors that unfolded after the cancelled wedding, but we‚Äôre not given any information about it. Later, through dialogue, Evangeline learns of information she needs to know to progress the plot, but it‚Äôs done in quite a heavy-handed manner. There‚Äôsa lotof it, and wasn‚Äôt done subtlety or in small pieces, like you might see elsewhere in other novels.To give myself something positive to say about this book, I did like its short chapters and relatively fast pacing. As a slow reader, I appreciated being able to get through this book super quickly. Yes, that‚Äôs all I have to say. Moving on!The book ends on a cliffhanger. It‚Äôs somewhat intriguing, but I certainly won‚Äôt be reading the sequel. If for whatever reason, after reading this review, you‚Äôre still inclined to readOnce Upon a Broken Heart, you might want to hold off on doing so until the sequel is out, as this will leave you with too many loose plot threads and unanswered questions ‚Äì more than any book should.Thank you to Kate Keehan and Hodder & Stoughton for the eARC!‚Ü† 1 starBookstagram‚ú¶BookTwitter‚ú¶BookTok15/04/2024: I'm far too late in adding this, but if you're looking for a YA fantasy series (with enemies to lovers, morally grey characters, and corruption arcs) that will actually be worth your time, may I direct your attention toThe Kinder Poisonby Natalie Mae!""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""4 starsThis is one of the most interesting worlds I've encountered in fantasy books.

His kiss is deadly, his heart doesn't beat, and the most important ‚Äì he's heartbroken and is cursed to never find love, which gives Eva hopes that he might help her.

It could have been a twig, a piece of paper, or her.Evangeline Fox‚Äî she's just a naive girl with a hopeless romantic personality, and well, she's quite delusional but would call herself hopeful! She has been surrounded by so many fairy tales that she just wants her life to be like it. She's smack-dabbed in the face with the realities, but she'd rather create alternatives to not tarnish the image of people she cares about. I actually liked her selflessness and her acceptance of her BAD DECISION. But there's nothing much interesting to her character besides this.Not a huntress or amazing at fighting too lmao. So far, she's a hopeless romantic who's kind of attracted to Jacks because he's a baddie but doesn't want to die either by kissing him.Enemies to lovers‚Äî their dynamic is so good? Evangeline has hot and cold feelings for him. She's torn between wanting to kiss him or hate him.

He outright accepted that he manipulated her. He's actually evil in this book regardless of his past, and he threatened her subtly that she'd die if she didn't agree with her part of the bargain. I'm all but patient for his character development and just to see his softie side, after all, a glimpse of it when he carried her through the cold just to take her to get a cure for the poison she got and let her sleep in his arms the whole night , was just üò≠üíû‚ùùYou could have unlocked me as well‚ùû‚Äî I was wondering if Jacks had indulged her and struck a deal with her in the first place because she opened the church's door. It's known she can open Valory Arch, but maybe that was the time when Jacks realized that she's the rose-gold haired girl who's the one who can open the arch. and he didn't know her before.Apollo being in love was so funny! I only liked that scene where they were talking and he was being nice, but otherwise, he was really quick to dismiss Eva in the first place, and Marisol is just a bitch! I just knew something was sus about her since the start because no one is too kind, and she's after all her mother's child, and yep she definitely stole Luc. I knew Jacks is evil! I do love him, but he's so manipulative, and the ending actually shocked me! I still hate Marisol because she's a bitch, but damn the way Jacks went through so much just to frame her and wrongly accused Eva just to get the prophecy right üòÆ\u200düí®ü§öüèª and yeahhh 4 stars just because, it had wayy too much info dumps!

I was pulled into his character starting with the Caraval series (Not required but totally recommend reading first)When I first met him he comes across as this tortured character, not to be confused with a tortured hero- he does terrible things for his own advantage but then you get glimpses of a softer, more caring side, making him villainous on one hand and with some of his other actions more anti-hero/quasi-hero.*I\'m literally dying, I love him-SWOON*Àö ‡ºò‚ú∂ ‚ãÜÔΩ°Àö ‚ÅÄ‚û∑Jacks gave her a smile that was all sharp edges. A drop of blood fell from the corner of his mouth, and something godforsaken washed over his expression.

She is more or less prone to letting her desires influence her decisions.There\'s this push and pull between the two of them that I find so delicious. Readers of Caraval understand Jacks\'s reluctance to give into temptation - for those of us that love these morally gray characters - Jacks is it. You can\'t help but wish for him to win the girl.‚ÅÄ‚û¥ÀéÀäÀó‚ÄúI don\'t know if I can fix your broken heart, but you can take mine because it\'s already yours.‚Äù‚ÄúBut you have to have a working heart for it to break.‚Äù‡ºâ‚Äß‚ÇäÀö.Evangeline seems to be more hesitant based on Jacks\'s reputation, fully accepting who he is and the things he has been done, or is rumored to have done. You can feel the magnetic pull that they have on one another, and when they give in to that pull, sparks fly (like in the mausoleum scene ‚Äì if you know, you know üòâ).Full stop- waiting with total baited breath to see what happens with these two.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 're-read [Oct. 17, 2023]: 5‚≠ê""Heroes don\'t get happy endings.

But will she find him before it's too late?","[{'rating': 5, 'content': ""FIVE FRANK-FREAKING-TASTIC, AMAZING STARS coming up!This series has truly educational purpose: especially last chapters of this book literally taught me how to speak Gibberish! I‚Äôm stunned, startled, speechless and numb. I loved the first book so much and as soon as I got my digital copy, I jumped up and down several times on the couch and broke it! ( Thankfully not my Ipad, I just broke my favorite couch! Shame on my over exaggerated excitement skills and too much sweet consumption during quarantine and chill times!)I was so happy to see Pip and Ravi back. After solving five years old cold case, acquitting Ravi‚Äôs brother Sal Singh‚Äôs honor and bringing justice for him and Andie Bell by finding the murderer, she was ready to talk and reach a bigger audiences about the progression of the events and her crime solving methods via podcast (thanks to Ravi, who named the podcast with series‚Äô name)Now she‚Äôs sharing the details and interviews as Ravi resumes his court visits to pursue Max Hastings‚Äô case who drug-rapped to many girls at the school including Nat who truly hates Pip right now because of being wrongly accused by her.When the life turns into its new normal routine and Pip promises herself not to get obsessed with any other case and live her life as a normal young adult (sweet 18 times!), attending the memorial of Sal and Andie, she finds herself dragged into Jamie Reynolds‚Äô case: who is missing and his brother Connor who is also her high school friend needs her help to find him.Pip has no idea who 24 years old, outcast young man‚Äôs disappearance will bring out more terrifying secrets of town, fish netting online sites, secrets and Pip finds herself playing more dangerous game will bring her at the edge of tremendous breakdown because this time she took few more steps to the dark side and she may fall down from the cliff at any second. Even her loved ones and dear Ravi cannot help her this time.This was record time reading and at the beginning I thought the first book was a little better but when I reached to the last third, my mind was already blown away! My heart rate goes through the roof! I kept murmuring ‚ÄúHolly Sh*t‚Äù like a mantra several times and ending was epic, dazzling, dark, thought-provoking, volatile, phenomenal!Now I‚Äôm looking at the ceiling with a numb expression on my face and I can start screaming any time because the book is finished and I need more books of the series! I already missed the fast paced, nail biting, little hair lifter, excitingly delicious story telling. It‚Äôs addictive and I want more. I want it now. (Freddie Mercury‚Äôs song lyrics blaring in my ears!) I don‚Äôt know how I could wait for one more year! Give me patience Lord!I'm thanking myself and my husband's credit card for this copy! I bought it and I enjoyed every second of it. Highly recommended one of my favorite YA thrillers of the year!medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""I made a promise. . . . I said I would never do this again, never play the detective, never again lose myself.Pip has sworn off solving mysteries for good. Now she's just following the trials from her one and only bout of sleuthing and updating her podcast with all the latest developments. But when a friend goes missing and the police refuses to do anything, Pip knows she'll have to step up again, even if it costs her everything.Sometimes I read a book, and it so far exceeds my expectations that I wonder afterwards if maybe I'd hallucinated. That's how I felt about the first book in this series. It was young adult, yet it was so smart, sharp, gritty, and utterly unputdownable. Now that I've read book 2, I know it wasn't just a fluke because it yet again exceeded all my expectations.I'm one of those people who grew up reading Nancy Drew (and The Hardy Boys, of course, but Nancy was my main jam). And so I'm always on the lookout, hoping some new, smart, spunky teen detective would pick up the mantle and delight me once again. And I've found exactly that in Pip.One of my favorite things about this series is the way the investigation unfolds. Clues are collected and followed up, which then leads to the next set of steps and clues. It's all very logical. And the dossier format of interviews, articles, maps, notes, etc. is so masterfully done that it feels like I'm in the middle of a real investigation.Just a word of warning: this isn't one of those mystery series you can read in any order you'd like. This book contains crucial information on the resolution of book 1, something I'm very thankful for because I have absolutely terrible book-memory. But it means you must read the books in order or risk being completely spoiled.As I'm getting older, I've noticed that I'm slowly outgrowing YA, but this series still speaks to me. Its mysteries and the way they expose the darkness of human nature, but also its cleverness and resourcefulness through its teen detective, appeals to all ages. I cannot wait for book 3!~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:#1.A Good Girl's Guide to Murder#3.As Good As Dead~~~~~~~~~~~~‚úßConnect with me‚úßInstagram‚úß""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""okay WOW!I did not think Holly Jackson would be able to top A Good Girl's Guide To Murder -- but this book was fantastic!

She even goes to speak with them herself, but the officers don't take her seriously. Jamie has disappeared before and they think he has just skipped town for a few days.Pippa can't ignore the signs, however, and they all point to foul play.Against her better judgement, she agrees to look into it. She can't deny a friend in need and sit by while Jamie may be in danger, or worse.As her investigation begins, she unearths a lot of secrets Jamie has been hiding. It's a wicked web we weave, when first we practice to deceive.This was such a fun story. It didn't quite capture me to the extent thatA Good Girl's Guidedid, but I think that's mostly attributable to first being introduced to Pippa in book one.In the initial book, I loved learning about her as a character. Meeting a girl who was willing to go outside of her comfort zone and risk everything in the name of truth and justice.Pippa definitely felt more mature in this novel, like an old friend. She still has that same fire inside her to discover the truth though. She's really a character you can get behind.The mystery was well-plotted and I absolutely adored the podcast elements incorporated throughout. Podcasts are definitely a popular plot device over the past couple of years and it felt very natural within this story.Holly Jackson has such a pleasing writing style.

Que va con todo. Se la suda todo el mundo y va al 200% a resolver sus casos.Y eso es lo que vemos en esta continuaci√≥n. Ya no le van a amedrentar y va a conseguir las respuestas.En este caso el misterio parece m√°s sencillo durante gran parte del libro, perova habiendo detalles que comienzan a hacerlo peliagudo.Como lector, algunos de los giros y tramas que se van desarrollando puedes ir intuyendo hacia d√≥nde van a tirar, pero no, la autora juega much√≠simo contigo y todo se convierte en otra cosa mucho m√°s grande, temible y llena de sorpresas.Qu√© bien encajado todo, y sobre todo, qu√© bien narrado.Porque esa es otra...Holly Jackson esmuybuena escritora.El primer libro ten√≠a una calidad incre√≠ble, pero creo que mejora en esta segunda entrega.

Adem√°s,el final de este libro no solo resuelve la desaparici√≥n, sino que nos deja elementos muy importantes para la continuaci√≥n, que creo que va a ser un cambio definitivo para esta saga.Estoy deseando leer el tercero... ¬°Esperemos que la editorial no tarde demasiado en traerlo a Espa√±a!En definitiva:Desaparici√≥n para expertoses unthrillerespectacular, con una protagonista determinada e inteligente, con un caso que se convierte poco a poco en algo m√°s grande de lo que aparenta en un principio,y que no deja de sorprender y te mantiene en vilo desde el primer momento.

Honestly, I feel violated, Holly Jackson called me stupid in at least 17 languages. There were so many twists and turns and I guessed NONE OF THEM. Usually when reading thriller/mystery, I have SOME IDEAS, now I had none lol. I was just trying not to get a heart attack. Actually, I had this one theory that I almost posted... so happy I didn't because BOY WAS I WRONG. Thriller is usually one of my favorite genres, but an aspect that it doesn't usually excel in is PROTAGONISTS you will root for. Detectives are usually weird, unlikeable, you don't understand the way they think, and they change from book to book. Here, that's not the case. Pip is your average girl, very smart, but she's just like you and me, she loves mystery but she's trying to lead a peaceful life (obv not trying hard enough). But, problems keep finding her. I feel like this is a huge part of the charm of this series (such a bad sentence). This book wasn't short, but I ATE IT UP. And it kept me hooked. I can't recommend this series (and this book) enough. I think it can work for anyone, even if you don't typically read this genre. It starts as this silly little school project and turns in this big bad dark monster. BUT IT DOES GRADUALLY, so you get to learn about the darkness of the world WITH PIP. BEAUTIFULBEAUTIFUL. It's executed so well also, there are so many formats within this book, interviews, articles, podcast files, pictures of evidence material, THAT COURT DRAWING... I GASPED.THE PLOT Have you heard? Pip is (in)famous in her town now. She launched the very first (and she hopes only) season of her podcast... as Ravi named it AGGTM (A Good Girl's Guide to Murder). While wrapping up the story, she's trying to live a normal life. Until her friend's brother goes missing. Police won't listen to Jamie's frantic brother and mother. But who will take the case seriously? Yes, Pip will.CHARACTERS You don't have to read this part, it's just me raving about how much I love these two.RAVI - THE BEST MAN. The definition of golden retriever boyfriend material. He's so supportive and wonderful. I wish we got more of him and Pip in this one, BUT I get why he wasn't that prominent. Sal's case of course affected him more and he had to spend a lot of time in court.PIP - THIS BARBIE IS MY FAVORITE DETECTIVE. I was on okay terms with her in the first book, BUT I FELL IN LOVE WITH HER IN THIS ONE. She's smart, meticulous, determined, kind, the best girl. I love her with Ravi, but as and individual as well.

Her podcast also had gone viral. Nothing in the world will bring Pip back to do investigative work again.But sometimes, in some exceptional cases where our intervention is inevitably needed, we will be forced to change our decision. Pip faces such a situation in her life when Jamie Reynolds suddenly disappears. Pip\'s initial thought was that the police would do whatever was necessary. But when she finds out that she will have to take the initiative to solve this case, Pip decides to restart her podcast and rekindle her investigative brain.What happened to Jamie? Why did he disappear precisely on the very same night the town hosted a memorial for the sixth anniversary of the deaths of Andie Bell and Sal Singh? Holly Jackson will answer these questions in this book.This sequel starts off somewhat slowly after the exciting investigative journey of Pip in the first book. The narrative pace quickly picks up and turns out more exciting than in the first book, especially during the central part of this novel. Even though this book deals with a few mature themes, it is pretty exciting to read after the initial 50 pages. The youngsters who are fond of mystery series books by authors like Enid Blyton, Hardy Boys, etc., are in for a treat here. But sadly, the author fails to maintain that pace during the latter part of the book, and the ending won\'t satisfy all the readers. Still, it is a decent book to read, like the first book, if you love to read books dealing with mysterious plots.What I learned from this book1) What will you do if someone you love calls you a waste of space or SOL (Space Occupying Lesion)?These are the worst words that you can call your loved ones. But unfortunately, there are still people who treat their loved ones like this. It can be your father, your partner, your friends, your colleagues, your boss, or even your children. We can see all the devastating consequences that such behavior can bring to your life in this book.Labeling and put-downs by parents or teachers are said to be the worst way to treat children.It is said that labels not just stick for life, but for generations. So please be careful when you think about calling your children a dummy or whether they suck at maths or science. If you are a grown-up individual but still staying with your parents or siblings, like Jamie in this book, and they are trying to devalue you by saying that you are useless, the first thing you should do is find a new place to live. You should stay away from them and contact them only when it is necessary and give a strict warning when they try to demotivate you. It doesn\'t mean to avoid your loved ones totally. But it is still better to keep a safe distance until they start to recognize your efforts and acknowledge your hard work. You should take charge of your life. It will be easier for you to succeed if you are surrounded by positive people instead of negative people.Holly Jackson is doing an amazing job of making people understand the nasty side effects of parents\' mistreating their grown-up children. She also indirectly says that there might be a history of bad parenting behind almost every unsuccessful person, and the insults and name-calling won\'t end even when their children have grown up and become adults.""Dad said, \'You\'re a waste of space.\'""2) Who are the people that you should be careful about?It is not the serial killers or the extreme psychos who try to physically hurt everyone in front of them that you should spend all your energy to avoid in your life. These people are few in number, and the probability of meeting such a person in your life is very rare. It is those silent killers who have personality disorders, who are sociopaths who emotionally shatter you, that you should be more careful about. The problem with them is that they are more in number now, and it is pretty tricky for an ordinary individual to understand whether the people they are talking with belong to this category. It is because they are pretty good at hiding their predatory traits and are walking amongst us as ordinary human beings.""Some people are pretty good at hiding who they really are.""Proper education and life experiences will help us to find out these silent predators.3) How far will the predators go for manipulation in court?This is one of those questions that many of you might have asked yourself after the famous case of two celebrity defamation cases in the US court in 2022. The mainstream media and the whole world were so obsessed with this case that every action of both parties was closely scrutinized by the public. The way one person tried to mirror the actions and dressing style of the other raised a lot of controversial debates. It was widely interpreted after the public reveal of borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder by the psychologist that one celebrity was trying to manipulate everyone in the court, the opposite lawyer and his client, and even the judge.We can see how the author describes a similar situation in this book. (This book was published in 2020 before all these fiascos happened). Everything they used for manipulation, including expensive suits, fake glasses (fake glasses without any proper indication are always a red flag), and how they dressed, is well depicted by the author.""Yeah, that seems to be the image he and his lawyer have settled on. Expensive suit, fake glasses. Maybe they think his blonde, messy hair will be disarming to the jury or something.""My favourite three lines from this book""Hunches have to follow the evidence, that\'s how this works.""""What do you do when the things that are supposed to protect you, fail you like that.""""Everything\'s a clue until we discount it.""What could have been better?I believe that the latter half of this novel should have been dealt with in a better way by the author. The way the author introduced a different subplot after the twist in the latter half was a little unconvincing. Some of the readers might feel tricked by the author as she doesn\'t initially give sufficient clues that connect with the subplot after the twist reveal. That feeling will be greater, and the reader will feel forcefully pushed to a parallel new story if we do a retrospective analysis of the novel after we finish reading it.The whole vandalizing episode was dealt with extremely immaturely and casually compared to the rest of the book. Just because someone did something wrong doesn\'t give you the license to take the law into your hands and do anything to them and their relatives. Either the author should have avoided the whole vandalizing episode or dealt with its aftermath in a more mature manner.Rating4/5Despite all the negatives I mentioned above, this book will still be a decent choice for you if you loved reading the first book in this series.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîYou can also follow me onInstagram ID - Dasfill|YouTube Channel ID - Dasfill|YouTube Health Channel ID - Dasfill - Health|YouTube Malayalam Channel ID - Dasfill - Malayalam|Threads ID - Dasfill|Twitter ID - Dasfill1|Snapchat ID - Dasfill|Facebook ID - Dasfill|TikTok ID - Dasfill1'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': "": ÃóÃÄ‚ûõ4 stars‚òÜ‚Äúsome people are pretty good at hiding who they really are.‚Äùgod that ending really fucked me up. ngl i did get teary eyed and a few tears may or may not have escaped.And she checked, down inside herself, under her skin, but she couldn‚Äôt find it.

And he jumped with her, hand in hand, into even her wildest conclusions. They just worked like that, teased out the best in each other, knowing when to talk and when to just be there.‚Äùconfession:i started this book bc i wanted to see ravi again. they are constantly on my mind even after reading the books. they make my heart burst with joy because they were so beautifully written. this book delivered with all the scenes that he was in! the way they describe their interactions and how pip glowed anytime she was with ravi was so heartwarming to read about. i really need a ravi singh in my life. you‚Äôre telling me they said i love you in the rain and kissed?? i‚Äôm not going to be available for the foreseeable future bc i‚Äôll be too busy crying about them.that being said, the small scenes where he played a bigger role than pip‚Äôs boyfriend broke my heart. the way he connected to the case and had hope were so saddening to hear about when the realization of what it means to him hits. it felt as though every presence he made in this book was deliberate and i loved him so much. the way he tried his best to be there for pip and put up with her outbursts while staying with her throughout it was so sweet. i‚Äôm never getting over themthe only flaw was that the friendships within this book were disappointing. the true colors were revealed within this book and even though i expected ant and lauren to be bitches, i did not expect connor to be so shy and a pushover. he was constantly annoying pip and never listened to her advice and i tried my best to sympathize with him but it became hard to. especially since he became sort of a constant character who helped pip along this journey. not to mention the way he wouldn‚Äôt stand up for himself when his friends accused them of lying yet he knew the truth?? he was probably the only downside to reading this book, along with max hastings. the only friendship i liked was pip and cara‚Äôs. they stayed good friends throughout the book and understood each other.this book was so funny at times. it felt like the perfect mix of everything combined into one which i loved. it would shift from funny to creepy and keep me on my toes all the same. the small banter was everything with pip and ravi and their small little ways of communicating were both adorable and hilarious at the same time. i hope they never lose their humor and their love. this book never lost my interest and i loved practically everything about this book.‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I feel guilty all the time, so I don‚Äôt need you to tell me. I‚Äôm the expert on my own mistakes. I understand.‚Äù‚ÄúShe hadn‚Äôt almost lost herself, maybe she‚Äôd actually been meeting herself for the very first time. And she was tired of feeling guilty about it.

She‚Äôs still kind of predictable and plays into some repetitive tropes, but I feel like I‚Äôm growing up alongside her. She‚Äôs maturing emotionally and mentally, and I‚Äôm rooting for even more growth in book 3. She might just pull through as a solid character by the end.Ravi: Oh my god, this guy. Ravi is the MVP. The way he cares about Pip? The support, the teamwork, the fact that he‚Äôs always documenting stuff and showing up for her‚Äîit‚Äôs all so wholesome. They‚Äôre the couple you want to root for, and his ‚Äúlift you up when you‚Äôre down‚Äù energy is everything.Stanley: This man needs an apology from the whole world. Like Sal, he carried guilt for something that wasn‚Äôt his fault, and it crushed him. The way Pip handled revealing the truth? A solid moment. He deserved that vindication, and my heart genuinely broke for him.‚û∑**Final Thoughts**The character development was the only thing keeping this book afloat for me. The rest was just... meh.

Holly Jackson seems to outdo the first book and I am simply amazed (no, it is not possible). This is probably one of the best murder-mystery novels I've read in a long time and I'm so glad it failed to disappoint me (disclaimer: I've been disappointed a lot by the middle book syndrome). But Holly Jackson literally said: SIKE, YOU BET!The author managed to keep me guessing and stay for the truth. There were so many twists and turns that worked very well with the plot developments. I remember pointing out in the first book that all the clues felt rather coincidental and merely luck. However, Pippa truly proves herself over and over that she has what it takes to be a true investigator.This book offered another kind of format that is still well organized and written. Holly Jackson lured me back into Pip's story with a great opening line and a deftly constructed synopsis of the events of the last book. As the number of suspects expands and secrets, lies, and false identities are uncovered, the plot moves at a very fast pace. A total page-turner.And to see Pippa and Ravi again was my ultimate goal in continuing this. We get to see the romance without it taking away the overall suspenseful atmosphere of the book. It was just a bummer that Ravi's presence felt less significant in this one as it focuses more on Jamie (a brother to Pippa's friend). I don't mind me more Ravi („Éé^‚àá^)I was also definitely surprised with the revelation, despite the suspicion. And as much as I enjoyed it, it feels a bit underwhelming(probably because it involves new people in the town so I don't find myself feeling connected, considering a little establishment to the culprit's backstory as compared to the first book).Nevertheless, this is another success from Holly Jackson. Good Girl, Bad Blood is bewildering, intense and dark. I couldn't wait to start the last book (gonna miss Pippa, I just know).[4.5/5]""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""‚≠ê2.5Ehhhhh I didn't care for it and I am so disappointed.I really loved A Good Girl's Guide to Murder and this had similar podcast/interview elements I enjoyed so much. But it lacked Pip's tenacity and grit. Pip felt washed out and bland. She depressed me to be honest. I know the character was tired but it felt overdone.The mystery of the missing brother was lackluster at best for the first 2/3's of the novel. Then the twists started coming and they didn't stop coming. And they were insane (I mean that in a bad way, if it wasn't obvious). Completely left field. Nothing anyone could have predicted or even imagined. I did not like the ending at all.I think this book is probably suffering from middle-book syndrome. It felt very episode-of-the-week.I am still interested in picking up the third book however. I have hope for this storyline.""}]"

NEXT!and the suspense element was also much better in the first book because there was actually some action. the suspense (can we even call it that?) in this was so badly done compared to the first book. i think i appreciate ava and alex\'s story more in that aspect because we actually see it unfold and, like i said, there was actually some action. not only that, but right from the beginning, we\'re thrown into this ""suspenseful"" act so we go through the book wondering what\'s happening (even if you know what it was). with this, there was none of it for me.i liked that bridget volunteers at an animal shelter. my vegan animal loving self just loves everything animal care related.that\'s basically it.eh, i‚Äôm excited for jules and josh‚Äôs book though!and stella and christian? with that ending? üëÄ'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'OMFG this was so good !!! way better than the first one. this book fucked me up !! literally my bones were shaking the entire time i was reading this.Rhys -fuck !!! he‚Äôs a MFing DILF !!! this zaddy could take me anywhere. ok so get this - Bridget is the royal princess, she has some authority, but guess who‚Äôs in charge?

Say it ain\'t so!I have trouble passing up books with the word ""bodyguard"" in its description (cue ""I Will Always Love You"" by Whitney Houston). In fact, I picked up the first book of this series solely because I wanted to read this one. The princess and the bodyguard is a pairing as old as time, not to mention absolutely swoon-worthy, and before I cracked open the first page, I was filled to the brim with anticipatory glee for all the fun I was about to have.And for the most part, I enjoyed the story itself. It was a bit long-winded, but compared to instalove, I\'ll take a slow burn any day. While this didn\'t break any new ground and is pretty much what you\'d expect from the trope, it was still fun. Rhys the Bodyguard is all like I take security very seriously ma\'am, and Bridget the Princess is all like you can\'t tell me what to do. I\'m totally on board with that.And yet. Yet, yet, yet. I feel like something was missing. Was it better chemistry, more snarky banter? I\'m not sure. All I know is what I got felt like a paler version of what it could\'ve been. Or maybe the problem is me and I built this up so much in my head, nothing could possibly meet it.One thing I do know for sure is that Ana Huang\'s male characters are a bit too much for me. They\'re so sexed up and possessive, it\'s hard to take them seriously. They way they talk and act, you\'d think they came straight from the chest-thumping Stone Age. No other man can even look at their women, lest glares and threats erupt from their mouths. They\'re constantly like, Who do you belong to? Me! And that\'s more or less verbatim.And the sex scenes. Ugh, I feel like such an old fuddy duddy for saying this, but they were so frequent and unrealistic in that porny way, I was cringing with embarrassment for the characters. I enjoyed the first third of the book so much more simply because there was no sex in it. But the last two-thirds felt like every other scene was dramatic sex, and I was so over it.It\'s hard to really enjoy a story if I\'m cringing my way through so much of it, and that\'s what happened here. Obviously, romances are personal, and this is clearly a case where my tastes just don\'t quite line up with the author\'s. And there\'s nothing wrong with that.

UGH it was just all soooo good and so well written!!! The way they both wanted one another since the beginning..

From gorgeous Costa Rica to a stunning castle ugh I LOVE IT!!! I honestly need more books like that with that sort of setting, it‚Äôs just so‚Ä¶ romantic!!!Speaking of romantic, THESE TWO ARE DEFINITION OF SAID WORD!!!!!!I was literally squealing, giggling, kicking my feet, twirling my hair and blushing like a goddamn tomato!! They were just so adorable!! They had everything they needed to have! Banter, chemistry, tension (romantic and sexual), cuteness, jealousy, spice and MOREEEE!!! They‚Äôre just so perfectly written I could cry!!!The way they‚Äôre also each others‚Äô rocks?!?!Like Rhys being able to be himself and open up to someone for the first time and feeling so comfortable and feeling AT HOME with Bridget, made my heart beat a million miles per second!!!Same the other way around!! Bridget feeling so at ease with him and actually being able to lean on someone and getting supported by Rhys‚Ä¶ It was just so endearing to see them both act so sweetly with each other! No (pure) romance book couple has ever lived up to their love (if you ask me)!!!!!Rhys is also the most perfect man ever!!! He‚Äôs definitely the best Twisted man and he might not be YOUR favourite but you can definitely admit that he is THE BEST out of all the Twisted men! Like the way he stood by Bridget no matter what, fought so strongly for their love and is willing to give up everything just to see her happy?!!! I‚Äôm crying, screaming‚Ä¶And HE DOES NO WRONG!!!! He didn‚Äôt need to grovel because HE IS PERFECT IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE (if it isn‚Äôt obvious enough I‚Äôm pretty much in love with him lol)Anyway.. besides the romance, I loved the sub-plot of politics and monarchy! It was amazingly involved into the plot and just shows how corrupt the system can be (most definitely not only in fiction).Seeing Ava and Alex again, happy and together, was also so pleasing to read about and seeing the other characters as well was so endearing!Let‚Äôs just say I loved every second of this book and if you haven‚Äôt read it yet‚Ä¶ GET TO IT NOW!!!!! It is worth EVERYTHING!!! Even if you may have disliked the first book, definitely give this one a try!!Overall, this will most likely always be my favourite romance book and Ana Huang book ever and I‚Äôm so glad to have read it not only once but twice!!

The two year jump in their relationship threw me a little at first, but I think it was needed to support that he really was a professional and that his heart softened to her over time.After her brother abdicates his claim to the thrown, Bridget finds herself as the unexpected heir. With this unwelcome change, she feels the last vestiges of her free will slipping away and creates a lists of things she wants to do before she takes the thrown. She basically propositions him, and I felt that this was the best way for them to finally come together. I don‚Äôt think he would have ever crossed that line if he hadn‚Äôt felt like it was what she needed. He could deny himself, but he couldn‚Äôt deny her anything. üôåüèª He also thought they would be parting ways since she would no longer need private security once she was living at the palace full time which added to the plausibility of him choosing to break protocol with her.This was a little longer than I typically like a contemporary romance to be, but I always felt very engaged in the story. Their chemistry was sizzling and their backstories and personalities were perfectly developed. I LOVED that we got to read from both POV‚Äôs. Nothing beats dual POV with a strait-laced grumpy MMC.

All of their interactions honestly bored me to tears or simply just pissed me off. They had no chemistry at all.Part of me wanted to push her away from me, and another part wanted to drag her into my arms and keep her as mine. Except I couldn‚Äôt.

Because the only thing I took from this is that Adam\'s eyes areblueblue blue blue cobalt blossoming bruise clear as the midnight sky blue.Dark blue eyes dark brown hair sharp jawline strong lean frame.His eyes are the perfect shade of cobalt, blue like a blossoming bruise, clear and deep and decided.I\'ve tried so hard to get those blue blue blue eyes out of my head but I know him I know him I know him....blue and bottomless...I\'d recognize your eyes anywhere in the world.He still has the most unusually blue eyes I\'ve ever seen....the deep dark blue of the eyes I\'ve learned to swim in.His natural tan offsets a pair of eyes a shade of blue in a midnight sky.*aggressive coughing*Ma\'am, this is a Wendy\'s.I actually didn\'t mind the writing, as long as it wasn\'t about Adam\'s eyes. The biggest complaint I see is usually related to the purple prose and long-winded metaphors and awkward phrases, but I enjoyed it...? To a point. I thought most of the strange metaphors were accurate, and the somewhat unconventional style of writing really helped to portray Juliette\'s trauma, which was my favorite part of the book. Too bad it all disappeared when she ‚ú®fell in love.‚ú® Because that\'s just how the world works.I did find some, uh, interesting quotes:Raindrops are my only reminder that clouds have a heartbeat.I wonder about how [raindrops are] always falling down, forgetting their parachutes as they tumble out of the sky toward an uncertain end. It\'s like someone is emptying their pockets over the earth and doesn\'t seem to care where the contents fall, doesn\'t seem to care that the raindrops burst when they hit the ground, that they shatter when they fall to the floor, that people curse the days the drops dare to tap on their doors. I am a raindrop.Someone picked up the sun and pinned it to the sky again, but every day it hangs a little lower than the day before. It\'s like a negligent parent who only knows one half of who you are. It never sees how its absence changes people. How different we are in the dark.I\'m wearing dead cotton on my limbs and a blush of roses on my face.I catch the rose petals as they fall from my cheeks, as they float around my body, as they cover me in something that feels like the absence of courage.These words are vomit. This shaky pen is my esophagus. This sheet of paper is my porcelain bowl.1 word, 2 lips, 3 4 5 fingers form 1 first.1 corner, 2 parents, 3 4 5 reasons to hide.1 child, 2 eyes, 3 4 17 years of fear.I wish I could stuff my mouth full of raindrops and fill my pockets full of snow. I wish I could trace the veins in a falling leaf and feel the wind pinch my nose.Every muscle every movement tightens, every vertebra in my spinal column is a block of ice.My eyes are 2 professional pickpockets, stealing everything to store away in my mind.My words wear no parachutes as they fall out of my mouth.My dreams are bloody and bleeding and blood is bleeding all over my mind and I can\'t sleep anymore.The prospect of Adam in pain is like a cold hand clutching my esophagus.I can shoot a hundred numbers through the chest and watch them bleed decimal points in the palm of my hand. I can rip the numbers off a clock and watch the hour hand tick tick tick its final tock just before I fall asleep. I can suffocate seconds just by holding my breath. I\'ve been murdering minutes for hours and no one seems to mind.I could jump up to catch a breeze and live in its windblown ways forever.His lips are spelling secrets and my ears are spilling ink, staining my skin with his stories.My lungs are sawing my rib cage in half, but I force them to process oxygen anyway.I take a few bites of oxygen.My face has been slapped by a hundred hands.And one of those hands is mine.It\'s like... here, I\'ll write an example.Here\'s a normal sentence:""I walk down the cold hall.""Now make it as awkward as possible:""I walk down the hall, the linoleum as cold as the corpses of the women and children they\'ve killed, and my spine conducts enough electricity to power an entire city.""THE CHARACTERSJuliette:I didn\'t love her, but I liked the portrayal of trauma even though it suddenly disappeared halfway through. She needs to stop thinking in strikethroughs, but I don\'t have any real complaints. She\'s frustratingly stubborn at times, but she\'s a YA protagonist, obviously she\'s going to be stupid.Juliette can torture/kill people with her touch. She was locked away at a young age and has lived in solitary confinement ever since. She\'s a little kooky. I don\'t really care.Adam:Are you serious? I have to choose between an obsessed problematic psycho serial killer love interest and a blander-than-bland cardboard cutout organic whole wheat waffle love interest??Adam is the organic whole wheat waffle. He\'s probably better for Juliette than the psycho serial killer, but apparently he\'s not the endgame LI.To summarize his character development, he went from a somewhat interesting mysterious weirdo and Juliette\'s third grade friend to... a very bland concerning weirdo and Juliette\'s third grade friend.This is instalove disguised as we-were-friends-as-kiddos-and-now-I-love-you. Which is probably worse. Adam\'s entire backstory is that he was hit as a kid once (this was never mentioned again) and he\'s spent his entire life searching for Juliette. Because logic.I wouldn\'t have minded the abuse subplot if it were actually a subplot instead of something mentioned once and thrown away. Maybe if it, I don\'t know, actually affected him, I would call it deep and move on.I was okay with him until he and Juliette had a little dialogue sequence. He tried to give her a blanket (this was before he knew that she had magical killing powers) and she told him not to touch her, but he was being all rebellious and she said it again, and then she said this, to which he replied:""Maybe I don\'t want you to.""He makes a harsh sound. ""I disgust you that much?""When someone tells you not to touch them, you back off. It\'s basic courtesy and respect. Don\'t assume it\'s about you.Warner:Warner is the obsessed problematic psycho serial killer. In case you were wondering.Some of my friends have been telling me Juliwarner is a better ship than Julikent. I beg to differ. Adam may be an organic whole wheat waffle, but at least he\'s not an edgy guy with problems that could be solved by therapy but he\'s too tough for therapy so there\'s that. Ahem.He\'s, uh, strangely obsessed with Juliette and continually tries to make advances on her even after she shows no interest in him. First of all, he needs to stop. Second of all, he\'s blond?? That was random, but since when are villains blond? I was picturing him with black hair until I searched up fanart to see what Juliette looked like and Warner was there with his blond hair. This is not okay.WORLDBUILDINGWhat worldbuilding? All I know is that there\'s something called The Reestablishment, which is a dystopian government that does bad stuff. What bad stuff? Who knows? And apparently the planet is all desolate now because the sky is gray. *looks outside* Oh no, the sky is gray.

This is not a novel, it is a collection of similes and metaphors, most of which do not make sense. I originally gaveShatter Metwo stars because that\'s my sort of kneejerk reaction to books I don\'t like, but after thinking it over for a while, I can\'t recallanythingpositive about it that would justify a rating of more than one star.You\'re probably assuming - correctly - that I went into this book with low expectations. This is completely true. Any so-called ""dystopia"" with a runway model on the front cover leaves me feeling sceptical. However, I was also prepared to allow myself to be surprised; a lot of my friends loved this and one of the biggest criticisms didn\'t actually bother me - purple prose. I think there\'s a fine line in writing between the pretty and the purplish and different readers will define it in their own way. For example, some reviewers thought thatLips Touch: Three Timeswas just a mess of bloated purple prose, whereas I thought it was one of the most beautiful books I read last year. I have a high tolerance level for flowery writing. But...Shatter Me\'s numerous metaphors, similes, and endless descriptions just didn\'t make sense. What is this?:""Hate looks like everybody else until it smiles. Until it spins around and lies with lips and teeth carved into semblance of something too passive to punch.""I just...WHAT???This is one example floating around in there, but every second sentence is like this! That\'s not even mentioning the annoying strike-outs. Trust me, no really,trust me, I thought people were being overly picky when they said the crossed out sentences were annoying. I actually thought it sounded interesting, unusual, especially because the whole thing is meant to be written in a notebook and I cross stuff out in mine all the time.But you have no idea how bloody annoying this is to read. All the effin\' time.People didn\'t exaggerate: it will most likely drive you crazy.However, there was one thing that for me was even more annoying than the descriptions, the similes, the strikes, and that was the stupid repetition thing:""and then and then and then...""Again, if it had been used once, or sparingly even, then it wouldn\'t be so bad. I may have thought it was an interesting literary technique. ButShatter Mehad way way way too much of everything (see what I did there?).And story? What story? *sigh* It\'s about time we just opened up an entirely new genre called ""Dystopian Romance"" or alternatively ""Romantic Dystopia"", though I don\'t wish to be pessimistic, I\'m pretty sure half the new releases of 2012 will make it into that category. If there was a story then it drowned amidst the waves of overenthusiastic and flowery prose. This reminded me ofArticle 5in that the dystopia was there to make the romance interesting. One was certainly there to complement the other, but it was the wrong way around.Also... kissing when you are fleeing for your lives?? I\'m sure this is not the correct way of things, right? And yet it occurs in way too many young adult books. I\'m like: ""run, run, run!"" but the characters are too busy swapping saliva. I must be old-fashioned in my thinking that staying alive is kinda important.There are a lot of things that, had they been there, could have convinced me to up this to two stars. One star ratings make me feel sucky. But I\'m sorry guys, I wasn\'t even entertained. The beginning was intriguing but there was so little plot beyond the romance that it quickly became tedious.

As the story goes on this device gets used less and less and so it feels more like Mafi just used it in the beginning for fun and to make her book look different from the rest of the young adult books out there, which, unfortunately, it is NOT, especially when you get to the romance.

And I gotta say, It\'s.... weird returning to book one. Ignite Me is my favorite book of all time, and rereading that book is such an immersive experience that I always come out of feeling empowered. This book, on the other hand, holds such a special place in my heart because it\'s so relatable that it hurts. From Juliette\'s panic to her awkwardness to her resilience to the writing style, everything just hurts so good. There\'s parts of me that I see in Juliette, and there\'s parts of Juliette that I wish I could be better at. It\'s just such a refreshing and inspirational book to read because it\'s about someone who has been handed the shittiest circumstances and still looks for the best in others, perseveres, and demands what\'s right for her. It\'s about learning to trust and realizing your worth and giving people second chances. FUCK i\'m about to cry typing this review. I love Juliette so much and I love Tahereh even more for sharing a story that touches the deepest corners of my heart. It\'s truly a life-changing book for me.I‚Äôve always read this as the story of a sad, self-conscious, self-loathing girl learning to see past obstacles to find love in herself and to let others in. however, i haven\'t read this since summer 2016, so my experience of reading this after the election & other #stressful political happenings opened my eyes to a completely new underside of the story. It had always been visible to me but was it never at the forefront, but this time I noticed it so vividly: this is also the story about a deeply hurt and angry girl who wants justice. People always criticize Juliette for being weak and annoying, especially in Unravel Me, but when she pushes back against her fear and stands up for herself, it\'s jaw-dropping. I envy her ability to know what\'s best for her and hold others\' happiness and safety above her own even though she\'s gone through so much turmoil and deserves to be the person being looked out for. I used to think that Juliette gets suddenly really strong in Ignite Me, but reading this closely just showed how ready she was for that transformation. In my annotated editions, I use blue highlighter to mark parts where Juliette is really badass, and I didn\'t expect to use it a ton in this one, but it\'s everywhere. Juliette is a pure and fearless motherfucker. Even in book one she has powerful quotes like ""I\'m not yours to want,"" and it challenges all the ideas Warner tries to install into her head.Which is where this book gets slippery. It\'s getting really, really difficult for me to reconcile Warner\'s actions in book one. I\'ve definitely had others question how I ship Juliette with Warner after all he\'s put Juliette through in this book, and it\'s a valid concern. Every time I think about this book, i\'m just kinda like ‚Äúhahaha problematic warner but whatever.‚Äù But the more I reread, especially after ignite me came out, and ESPECIALLY during this particular reread, the more questions I have that I can only hope will now be explained in restore me. Don\'t get me wrong, this book still means so much to me because of juliette, but there‚Äôs no possible way for me to read this book with the mindset ‚Äúomg i love warner!!‚Äù because he‚Äôs literally the villain and he does and says so many problematic, manipulative things. Honestly, I don\'t think it\'s fair to justify everything Warner does. While rereading this I was actually shocked at the amount of nasty things he says to her, that I obviously must have forgotten or blocked from my memory. Things like telling her she\'ll be miserable if she leaves him because no one else will want her, calling her a monster, professing his love for her even when she\'s clearly uncomfortable. In Unravel Me and Ignite Me he explains why he did these things and says that he regrets doing it, but... it seems to gosofar in this book. I almost theorize that Tahereh must have written warner in book 1 to continue being a villain throughout the series, but there\'s way too many threads that suggest otherwise (ie. the introduction of the angst behind warner\'s mom, the fact that she felt ""electricity"" during their kiss, etc.)I feel like I could write an essay about this topic: the inconsistencies of Warner\'s personality, and whether or not it\'s justifiable to forgive him for his ""misjudgments"" of Juliette. It\'s just so strange to me that Adam & Kenji can say ""Warner is a lot of things, but he\'s not stupid,"" and yet Warner misreads her SO horribly. I mean, in the scene that he corners her and kisses her, he\'s literally saying ""I want you to choose me"" and ""I love you"" and later admits that he thought she was into it, EVEN THOUGH she literally said ""You\'re sick/you\'re a monster/etc."" and physically tried to punch him before he pinned her to the wall. If he\'s so smart, then why couldn\'t he tell that every time he talks to her, she\'s afraid and disgusted? Is it really that easy to mistake fear for excitement? Disgust for nerousness?His behavior is so coercive and manipulative, and even though I know he was just trying to get a reaction out of her so that she would abandon her fear and finally use her power, there\'s not nearly enough of an apology as I would expect for things of this magnitude. The reason why I don\'t consider Warner an outright misogynist is an incredibly nuanced (and long) discussion, but the difference between him and, say, a Colleen Hoover character is that while Warner is saying and doing problematic things, he is also being cast in a problematic light. He is literally the villain of this story for putting her in those situations. Had Juliette been like ""omg he\'s pinning me against a wall and threatening me, he\'s so dominating <3"" then that would a lot more concerning. But I\'m gonna have to reread Unravel Me as well to refresh my memory on how Warner addresses these actions and words because I really don\'t think he apologized or explained himself well enough, and I think it\'s totally valid for Juliette to absolutely roast him in Restore Me for treating her so shittily. My outrage about it is fresh though, and maybe Juliette comes to terms with his actions in a later book that I\'ve forgotten about.Also? Drag me, but Adam doesn\'t get enough credit in this book. I know we all love to shit on him--myself included--for the direction he goes in Ignite Me, but his place in her journey of self-discovery is vital. Imagine this book without Adam, without that glimmer of hope and self-love that he installs in her. He\'s the first person to reassure her of herself and humanize her. Sure, they\'re not right for each other in the end, but it\'s not okay to dismiss their entire relationship as bullshit, because he DID help her see herself as something other than a monster, and I can\'t even imagine what this series would have been like if it were only Juliette brooding alone in her room, dreading Warner, stuck there until Warner was forced to tell her the truth about his mom or until Anderson showed up to ask what was taking so long. Idk. There\'s so many important quotes from Adam in this book. Sometimes it falls into the type of narrative that feels like ""ugghhhh, she needed a boy to \'fix\' her,"" but in reality, sometimes your friends have your back and reassure you of your worth, and sometimes your friends are more than your friends. I could make a LIST of all the positive things Adam said to Juliette in this book that caused her confidence to sky rocket, whereas almost everything Warner said installed panic and fear in her.So clearly I have conflicting feelings, but none of them intercede with the fact that I still cannot get over how much I adore this story. Sure, Warner sucks and I unironically wrote ""ew"" by half the things he says to her in this book, but watching Juliette\'s transformation and relating to her insecurities and thought process, as well as remembering how much I adored this book as a young teen, it\'s always going to be a priceless experience to me.July 2016I think this is my fourth or fifth time rereading it? I didn\'t plan to but my aunt showed interest in reading it and I jokingly offered to read it out loud to her, and she said yes. Thus, I proceeded to read this entire book out loud to her. And it was worth it.And what can I say? I love this book. I fucking love Juliette. Reading it out loud made me slightly more aware of how lame her stream of consciousness can sound, and how the metaphors become exhausting after a while. But I\'ve sort of accepted that book one is always going to be slightly uncomfortable to reread just because of the fact that so much has changed by book 3 that this is almost cringe-worthy. There\'s so much set-up for world building that never occurs. Honestly this book is more of a 3 star rating, but I can\'t bring myself to lower it. It was due for a reread since it had been just about two years, and, like always, I noted several things that I had missed or forgotten since I read it last!August 2015I\'m not quite sure why i\'ve never uploaded a review on goodreads for this book. I mean, I feel like it kind of goes without saying how I feel about it but ya know. This is my favorite series. If you\'re sick of dystopian and never want to read one ever again, make an exception for this one. Ignore the fact that the entire fandom (and myself) has probably majorly spoiled you. But this book. Holy shit. The writing. YES. The characters. YES. The plot. YES. The range of emotions. YES. I could tell you the things wrong with it, but no book is perfect. But if you want a book with characters that you will not be able to get out of your head and with a plot that will have you reading an entire trilogy in one sitting, this book is your friend.reread: July 2014'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I WANT WARNER SO BAD ITS NOT EVEN FUNNY'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""It's been 27 hours since I started reading this book.1620 minutes since I invited my doom.97200 seconds since my brain cells started disintegrating dyingdyingdyingdyingDead.

Between YA and bodice-rippers, I read more ""bad"" books than most elitist snobs will see in their entire lifetime. But then, I consider myself a connoisseur of the so-called trashy arts. There are two kinds of ""bad"" books. There are the books that tell good stories and while they aren\'t highbrow literature, they are still fun to read and if you can let go of your snobbery long enough to enjoy them, will perform quite serviceably as quality entertainment. Then there are the books that are just bad, and have no redeeming value at all.I had friends warn me about SHATTER ME. It\'s apparently infamous for the ""creative"" metaphors that the author likes to use. It\'s also yet another attempt to cling to the coattails of THE HUNGER GAMES (although it\'s more like DIVERGENT than THE HUNGER GAMES, which if you know my thoughts on DIVERGENT, you will know is not a compliment, coming from me). The premise is pretty undeveloped. Juliette has been in captivity for just under a year when she accidentally killed a boy by touching him. Her touch, you see, is deadly. She\'s like Rogue, from X-men. One touch, and your life force is hers.It\'s set on a dying Earth but why and how it\'s dying are incredibly vague. We\'ve apparently allowed a fascist-tolerant (if not outright fascist) regime to gain power, which Iwouldsay is not really giving the world a whole lot of credit, but on the other hand I\'m a liberal living in the United States right now, so on the OTHER hand, maybe future Earth is totally stupid enough to do that. It seems to happen a lot in YA dystopians, to the point where the reader begins to wonder if all it takes to start a fascist regime is a kickstarter and a special license. What matters is that resources are thin and there is not a lot of food and there are parts of the world that are radioactive(?) and for some reason, some people (especially Juliette) have mutant-like powers for Reasons and this is the world we live in.Both love interests are, conveniently, immune to Juliette\'s power. Because I guess it wouldn\'t be much of a romance if the book took the MC Hammer ""Can\'t Touch This"" approach to courtship. There is instalove up the wazoo in here, and even when Juliette finds out that Adam was put in her cell to spy on her under the guise of being a fellow prisoner, she forgives him stunningly quickly, and is constantly telling us how much she wants to touch him. She wants to touch the villain, Warner (I\'m sorry but I can\'t take you seriously when I\'m picturing the dancing frog mascot of the WB), too, although it\'s a traitorous body sort of desire to touch, the I-love-to-hate-how-I-hate-to-love-you type. Warner was the biggest potential sell of this series to me because I love villainous love interests but he\'s too creepy, even for me. Between the constant unwanted pet names and the really disturbing ""I could just take a bite out of you""-type comments, this dude was about one villain notch away from singing a Tim Curry song.Then there\'s the writing itself, which can be broken down into three categories: OMG, WTF, and LOL.OMG:Every organ in my body falls to the floor(68).I want to rip up the carpet and sew it to my skin(163).My jaw is dangling from my shoelace(310).WTF:I\'m wearing dead cotton on my limbs and a blush of roses on my face(6).There are 15,000 feelings of disbelief hole-punched in my heart(40).My throat is a reptile, covered in scales(172).I\'m blushing through my bones(326).LOL:I wondered if your eye color meant you saw the world differently(151).My heart is parasailing in the springtime(286).The author also makes two other attempts at being creative, which are overuse of the strikethrough tool and overuse of numbers, written as numerals instead of being spelled out. Which, if you ask me, is 1 bad idea because not only does it look unprofessional as 0 other writers do this, but 2, comes across as overly gimmicky and makes you feel like you\'re reading cast-offs from a teenager\'s poetry journal as she tries - and fails - to channel Ellen Hopkins and/or Rupi Kaur.If you like this book, good for you, I guess. I personally couldn\'t stand it. It felt incredibly derivative, and from the woe-is-me beginning to the yay-I\'ve-got-a-hypersexualized-supersuit ending, there was just way too much I ended up side-eying in this book for me to enjoy it. I don\'t think I\'ll be reading the sequels, not even for the lols.1 star'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'i think it was mitski that once said ‚Äúi am the god of my own art‚Äù and you know what, i really relate to that. this one, this review, is gonna be good. i can feel it in my bones.to be blunt, i hated this book. very much.i enjoy a good trashy book, a mindless romance or maybe that beautiful era of hunger-games-slash-divergent-cookie-cutter dystopian ya novels, as much as the next girl. i get that some things are just enjoyable, and believe it or not, while i enjoy really pretty writing, i have a relatively low standard for writing. not much can really bother me. i‚Äôve read a lot of unedited fanfictions.but of all the lowbrow things i‚Äôve ever read, never have i ever encountered something where the writing was so absolutely horrendous, i almost couldn‚Äôt read the book.and i almost couldn‚Äôt read this book.and i already know the comments i‚Äôll get sicced with: oh did you read the authors note? it was on purpose! she‚Äôs trying to show how insane juliette is!i know. i don‚Äôt care. maybe if we sit here for a while i‚Äôll find a fuck to give but as of right now, i really don‚Äôt care.every time i‚Äôve read this trope, it‚Äôs never a good excuse.what do i care if juliette‚Äôs insane, that‚Äôs not going to matter if i can‚Äôt read the book because the writing puts me into anaphylactic shock.grammar and language as a whole exists for us to be able to most accurately communicate and express ourselves. the absolutely ATROCIOUS writing was doing NOTHING for this book except heightening my blood pressure.i said, and stand by, the idea that grammar is flexible. it‚Äôs there just to help us communicate and clarify. THAT DOESN‚ÄôT MEAN YOU CAN JUST WRITE WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT HOWEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.first, the strikethroughs. what is wrong with you? how did you come up with this? are you okay? are you blind??? because this isbadreally bad.then there‚Äôs the writing every number numerically and not spelled out. that‚Äôs just dumb and immature, because no one else does this. it sticks out like a sore thumb and aesthetic wise, my eyes don‚Äôt like to read it either.then there‚Äôs the repetition. my brain my brain my brain was just about falling out out out. and of course there‚Äôs never any correct grammar because why start now.and the worst of it all‚Ä¶ the metaphors.this is the worst use of figurative language i‚Äôve ever read or even heard of in my entire life. it deserves an ‚Äúinappropriate use of figurative language‚Äù trigger warning.and of course i have receipts:tahereh: ‚Äúim wearing dead cotton on my limbs and a blush of roses on my face.‚Äùcaitlin: the fuck??tahereh: ‚Äúhis gaze is fixed on me: calm, unflappable; 2 buckets of river water at midnight. i‚Äôd like to cry into his eyes.‚Äùcaitlin: seriously, WHAT? and that sounds SO unsanitary like ew? and i barely like eyedrops.tahereh: ‚Äúmy body is a carnivorous flower, a poisonous houseplant, a loaded gun with a million triggers and he‚Äôs more than ready to fire.‚Äùcaitlin: this is actual bullshit. doesn‚Äôt mean anything. tahereh‚Äôs just hot for the sound of her own prose. not even a high school english teacher could find meaning in this shit.tahereh: ‚Äú‚Äòyou belong with me!‚Äô ‚Äòshe belongs with me.‚Äô‚Äùcaitlin: you‚Äôre on the phone with your girlfriend, she‚Äôs upset. she‚Äôs going off about something that you said, cause she doesn‚Äôt get your humor like i do.okay that one was unrelated, i just needed a break before rereading these quotes makes me carve out my own eyeballs with a rusty fork.tahereh: ‚Äúi fall off a ladder holding a paintbrush dipped in red.‚Äùcaitlin: no, this isn‚Äôt literal. i can‚Äôt even pretend to know what‚Äôs going on here.tahereh: ‚Äúi offer him a smile. try to keep my organs from falling out. hope the holes in my head aren‚Äôt showing.‚Äùcaitlin: oh i‚Äôll give her a real hole in her head. because no, this also isn‚Äôt real,unfortunately.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äînow the characters.(i had to come back for round two to write this at a later date.)juliette‚Äîis insufferable.i can‚Äôt believe i have to spend all of these books stuck inside her head.but more than just not really liking her, i hate what she stands for.the 2000s/2010s peak of bad-good ya dystopian novels is near and dear to my heart, that shit raised me, but god i‚Äôve forgotten how strongly i hate these female main characters.these characters like juliette who are special but sad and some of the most horny people i‚Äôve ever had the misfortune of meeting, but of course we‚Äôd never call it that because that‚Äôs improper or something, so instead the reader is bombarded with phrases like ‚Äúheat‚Äù and ‚Äúthunder‚Äù and ‚Äúlightning‚Äù and other names of men‚Äôs cologne.there is little that absolutely annoys the fuck out of me like the infantilized teenage girl mold: this girl who lives in complete isolation for years and, y‚Äôknow, is 17, but just discovers her body in the presence of a man! and we get to hear all about it! fuck that shit.anyways, other than that, she is just boring. pretty dumb. nothing new.adam‚Äîis boring. so vanilla.kinda wish he‚Äôd died, not because he‚Äôs bad but he‚Äôs just so mid. juliette‚Äôs head over heels and like‚Ä¶ for what?0/10, is a fucking pushover and doesn‚Äôt even have the personality to make up for that.now, warner‚Äîor rather, aaron. i‚Äôm not calling him warner, that‚Äôs so uncomfortably formal and let‚Äôs be real, he‚Äôs just a nepo baby and a literal child with an overinflated ego and half of the DSM-5.for all you girlies saying, ‚Äúoh i loved warner since the first book, blah blah blah,‚Äù and everyone else joking like, ‚Äúthat makes you a red flag lol,‚Äù we‚Äôre not kidding. holy shit?! liking him in the first book, before the actual plot makes it so you can like him, isn‚Äôt a heads up on everyone else.this is some weird phenomenon that‚Äôs started up in book communities, you see it with acotar and tfota too.this is not a flex. you‚Äôre not supposed to like him right now? and i don‚Äôt see a reason to, he‚Äôs actually awful. a piece of shit. and also doesn‚Äôt even have a personality to make up for his shitty ass actions.another thing, there was one line where he made her dress in a skimpy outfit and then stands there ogling her and she says something like, ‚Äúi‚Äôm so uncomfortable, i want to sew the carpet to my skin.‚Äù bad writing aside, i felt that shit in my soul. being ogled, catcalled, and just generally objectified is one of the most disgusting feelings in the world. it makes you want to tear your skin off your body. we‚Äôre meant to like this guy? he means as much to me as that one creepy neighbor when i was 10 and i hope they both get hit by a car.castle‚Äîdoes castle turn evil or bad? i feel like he does. it‚Äôs giving the-only-black-guy-in-twilight-is-evil vibes.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîthe plot.is the plot in the room with us?basically, you know how most books, even parts of series, have some kind of overarching plot to the book that then weaves into the series as a whole? because that‚Äôs good writing?well, surprise surprise, not here.i feel like i‚Äôm watching an episode of a season of this larger story, so there‚Äôs no wrap up at the end, no specific climax in the story, and no cohesive storyline. it‚Äôs a mess.i literally turned the page and couldn‚Äôt believe it had finished, and not because i was involved or anything, but because there was no sign of it ending at all, it‚Äôs like tahereh just decided to cut it off at a random chapter and boom, end of book.anywho (this is my concluding statement, watch and learn?), as i‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve figured, i did not have a fun time and i deeply regret spending money on this. oh, how i wanted to be one of the bookstagram tahereh mafi stans. maybe in another life.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""‚Äß‚ÇäÀöüñáÔ∏è ; ‚Å∫ ‚∏ù‚∏ù3 stars‚Äìno spoilersüåßÔ∏èwho's afraid of little old me,taylor swiftthen say they didn't do it to hurt mebut what if they did?‚Ä¶ i wanna snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made meyou wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised mein the beginning this book was so emotional and not at all what i would usually like in a book, and i can't really say that as it progressed it got better ... i started with high expectations as well but i'd done my research and was well aware of the popular opinion on this book: the first book is not it, but as the series goes on it'll get better. yeah, well that's probably the only thing i can rely on right now but do wanna still continue the series.i wanted to give it a 4 stars and, yes, i am a high rater but i felt as though 3.75 was the most fitting and not exactly a low rating (for some, at least).‚õß Àö ÀìÀì ‚Äúif any of you hurt her i will shoot you myself,‚Äù.·Øì ›ÅÀñwhat went right?‚Äî i absolutely adoreee the world in this!! i know i'm going to love it in the other books, so am very excited for that!‚Äî i liked how, in some parts, tahereh Mafi tried to sound poetic because it actually didn't sound too bad. it also helped me understand and realise that juliette was actually going insane in the asylum (let's face it: she wasss).‚Äî the middle part was addictiveee!‚õß Àö ÀìÀì ‚Äúi could love you, juliette. i would treat you like a queen.‚Äù.·Øì ›ÅÀñwhat went wrong?‚Äî i amnotcurrentlya fan of tahereh mafi's writing, but oh well, i'll probably end up enjoying it in the other books (yes, i clearly have really high hopes for them).‚Äî it was too muchdystopianfor me, and it was my first dystopian book so i can't exactly say i have a problem with the genre so it could either be that or it could be the way tahereh mafi has written it.‚Äî nothing actually happened in the book. like, juliette just spends some time in the asylum, goes to psych ward where we are introduced to a psycho, warner, and then runs away to adam's house. literally nothing else happens. it actually felt like reading a novella.‚Äî and i know i'm supposed like him in the other books, but why did tahereh mafi have to write warner's character so horribly in this book?

Everything you know is that she‚Äôs been imprisoned for ages and that she‚Äôs more than just a little insecure. Considering her ability this is no surprise though, the fact she can hurt and even kill people with just the touch of her fingertips making it kind of hard to be all too sociable. Juliette may not talk a lot but she sees everything and she‚Äôs more than just observant. She obviously also seems to have a knack for poetry and I really enjoyed the way she used her words.‚ÄúAll I ever wanted was to reach out and touch another human being not just with my hands but with my heart.‚ÄùAdam:That boy is hot as hell and Juliette‚Äôs new cell mate!

That boy is so funny and I really enjoyed his sassy demeanour. He‚Äôs constantly hitting on Juliette and his character gives the book a hilarious edge. I want more of him and actually can‚Äôt wait to meet him again! =)His grin is crooked. ""I don\'t know why, but I kind of like it when you threaten me.""""That\'s because you\'re an idiot.""""Nah.""

Crown of Midnight (Throne of Glass, #2)
",Sarah J. Maas,4.35,1309391,7263,"Young Adult, Romance, Fiction, Magic, Fae, Young Adult Fantasy, High Fantasy",420,15-08-2013,"An alternative cover edition for this ISBN can be foundhere.""A line that should never be crossed is about to be breached.It puts this entire castle in jeopardy‚Äîand the life of your friend.""From the throne of glass rules a king with a fist of iron and a soul as black as pitch. Assassin Celaena Sardothien won a brutal contest to become his Champion. Yet Celaena is far from loyal to the crown. She hides her secret vigilantly; she knows that the man she serves is bent on evil.Keeping up the deadly charade becomes increasingly difficult when Celaena realizes she is not the only one seeking justice. As she tries to untangle the mysteries buried deep within the glass castle, her closest relationships suffer. It seems no one is above questioning her allegiances‚Äînot the Crown Prince Dorian; not Chaol, the Captain of the Guard; not even her best friend, Nehemia, a foreign princess with a rebel heart.Then one terrible night, the secrets they have all been keeping lead to an unspeakable tragedy. As Celaena's world shatters, she will be forced to give up the very thing most precious to her and decide once and for all where her true loyalties lie... and whom she is ultimately willing to fight for.","[{'rating': 5, 'content': ""Shit seriously just went down.Oh wow, where do I start with this sequel? I wasn't even sure I was going to read it when I recently finishedThrone of Glassand found it entertaining but a poor excuse for fantasy. You want to know whatCrown of Midnightfelt like? It was like the author listened to every piece of criticism I could have thrown at the first book, listened to everything I loved and everything that irritated me... and then wrote a perfect kind of book. The kind I wanted the first one to be; the kind I hadn't dared to hope she might produce in this sequel. There was more action, more nastiness, more character development, more surprises, more complications, more sexy, no love triangle - all of this and a well-placed, never-saw-it-coming twist. Ms Maas, consider me impressed.Crown of Midnighttakes a huge step away from the tame romantic/bitchy drama of its predecessor and opens up a story that is a bigger, bloodier and meaner than I think many readers will be expecting. Celaena gets to fully explore all aspects of what it means to be an assassin in this book; she is tested constantly and you can see her growing and changing and learning as the story progresses. And this story is one tumultuous journey of extremely high ups and unbelievably low downs with Celaena taking relationships to all new levels and watching others fall apart. Old enemies resurface and we start to get a glimpse of just how big the picture Maas is painting for us actually is.One of the strengths of this book is having no idea how it's going to end. You might think that's a given, butThrone of Glassintroduced us to a plot that was fairly easy to see mapped out. We are told of the challenges Celaena must compete in and win, we know that's what the book is moving towards, and it isn't too much of a leap to assume that (one way or another) Celaena is going to emerge victorious. Not in this book. This book starts with a blank slate, any mysteries or troubles that are to come are completely unknown to us - so every turn the plot takes is a surprise and every surprise is thrilling. I can't wrap my head around justhow much betterthis sequel is. Maas has already grown as a writer and storyteller, making me wonder what she can possibly have in store for us next.The characters are also so much better developed in this book. Maas is brave enough here to allow the main characters to make mistakes, do the wrong things and test our ability to like them. Well, I don't know about you, but the new dimensions to their personalities, their faults and weaknesses, only served to make me like them more. Dorian surprised me most of all. InThrone of Glass, Dorian feels like something of a plot tool, a pretty little obstacle to Celaena and Chaol's romance. The scenes with him felt like filler between the parts I was actually waiting for. But not inCrown of Midnight! In this, Dorian emerges as an interesting character with secrets of his own; he makes sacrifices for the people he loves and his importance to the bigger story starts to become apparent.In short?Throne of Glass...Romance, love triangle, pretty dresses, one-dimensional characters, little action...Crown of Midnight...Badassery, twists, nastiness, betrayal, more action, magic, secrets...If you were so-so about the first one and considering *maybe* reading this, you have my thumbs up.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5/5 ‚≠êFull review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolfüê∫Chaol Westfall, a well-trained, muscular grown-ass man, Captain of the Royal Guard: *gets all soft and smooshy in this book*me: *needs to wrap him in a blanket, feed him some good hot Romanian rice pudding with lemon and sour cherry jam and protect him from the rest of the world because he is that precious*-\tActual plans that I really think about considering in a very serious wayAfter reading the first book of the series,Throne of Glass, I knew that I enjoyCrown of Midnight, but I‚Äôd never anticipated I‚Äôd enjoy itthat much.I\'ve decided to read this book in a teeny-tiny complicated period of my life: I\'ve been categorized by my ophthalmologist (cuz yeah, I wear glasses and not one buttwopairs, one of them being for reading, cuz yeah, my blind arse doesn\'t see well enough) as a ""are case"" and my eyes are ‚Äûsmashed"" because of too much reading and it\'s not normal. Sooo I\'ve been put through an ""a carrot a day"" cure and also ""only 30 minutes of reading"" cure. Because of that, I was not able to actually read as much as I wanted. But this book is giving to me a dependence that I am totally approving of, made me read so super-humanly fast that I\'ve managed to actually read enough in a day to accumulate the plot, the characters\' stories and the magic happening in general in Sarah J. Maas‚Äô world.This book was better than the first book from the beginning. I think it is so much easier to get into the second book of the series because you have the advantage of the first one. In some series, the second, third, fourth etc. books are not as good as the first one. But in this series, you can actuallysensethem getting better and better (or maybe this is only my opinion). So second book of the Throne of Glass series > the first book (but don‚Äôt get me wrong, Ilovedthe first book too).It is useless to talk about the plot at this point already: it‚Äôs the second book, some covered plans are being made in order to wipe the fussy king from the surface of this world. Talks about rebel alliances and plans and talks about some long-lost heir of Terrasen‚Äôs throne, Aelin Ashryver Galathynius start pumping the air of the book. Some think they are just rumours; some believe in them because their lives depend on these rumours. But until the end of the book, everything becomes just a huge ball of energy that absorbs everything (including your soul) and in my opinion, this is so important.Sarah J. Maas is, in my opinion, a genius mind. She makes us fall in love, she makes us sigh, get angry, cry, wanna die and so on. All these elements are important spices in the whole dish of a book. I don‚Äôt know about other people, every single person has a personal taste, but I really think that this whole series is based on a brilliant idea, also very good narrated, even though I‚Äôve read only two books.Now, talking about spice, even though I am actually kind of a bit (more) in love with Dorian, the Crown Prince of Adarlan, and I think he is the most charming and witty son of a wicked king I‚Äôve encountered (since present moment) in any of my reads (remember that I am fairly new to YA Fantasy club) and I love his beautiful soul and the way he and Celaena work together, I cannot not be happy to see how the relationship between Celaena and Chaol Westfall, Captain on the Guard, grew. At least in this particular book, at this given moment.

This is what I\'d like to call a gorgeous sequel. Dare I say it, it might even topThrone of Glass!Celaena Sardothien is doing her job as King\'s Champion, meaning she\'s killing people that stepped on the king\'s toes. And now she\'s got a new target: Archer Finn, former crush and friend from the time when she was within the Assassin‚Äôs Guild. Turns out, she\'s not killing her targets, but faking their deaths, so she\'s in a lot of danger if someone discovers her secret. The stakes are higher now that Archer is a well-known figure in Rifthold and that he might be involved in a rebel group. To make events even more complicated, the half-Fae and long-dead Queen, Elena, is asking Celaena to find the source behind the King\'s power.‚ÄúEverything in this world is magic. Thank you ever so kindly for stating the obvious.‚ÄùCelaena was a goddamn badass. I wouldn\'t mess with her in a thousand years. We finally see her wild and deadly side, the one that I\'ve grown accustomed to in the prequel e-novellas and that wasn\'t fully explored inThrone of Glass. Sure, she\'s still that sassy, arrogant and sarcastic girl, but above all, she\'s an assassin. A ruthless killer. And when the ones she loves are in danger or threatened, she\'s unforgiving. That part of her really gives you goosebumps. Oh, and let\'s not forget when she\'s in for revenge. One word: lethal.She was a whirlwind of steel and blood. As he watched her cut through the men like they were stalks of wheat in a field, he understood how she had gotten so close to touching Endovier‚Äôs wall that day. And at last‚Äîafter all these months‚Äîhe saw the lethal predator he‚Äôd expected to find in the mines. There was nothing human in her eyes, nothing remotely merciful. It froze his heart.Dorian Havilliard. Chaol Westfall. Dorian, Chaol, Chaol, Dorian. Chaol is the same sweet, loyal, funny, protective and fierce warrior. I loved his easy banter with Celaena and his alpha-male demeanor. Prince Dorian Havilliard is still the same passionate, kind, intelligent young man that is slowly transforming into a great ruler. And they‚Äôre best friends! How can I choose?!*crying*‚ÄúI worry because I care. Gods help me, I know I shouldn\'t, but I do. So I will always tell you to be careful, because I will always care what happens.‚ÄùInCrown of Midnight, Chaol and Celaena are getting close. Like really close. And because of that, both of their relationships with Dorian become more strained, awkward and tense. And that\'s kind of the single thing that bothered me at Celaena: inThrone of Glass, she was all over Dorian... and now? She doesn\'t care about his feelings when he clearly loves her. And that just got me going mad. I wanted to hug Dorian several times and give him cookies.Still, things evolve a little bit between them on a platonic level when a heartbreaking twist makes Celaena not trust Chaol anymore. And another unexpected twist involving Dorian makes things one hundred times more interesting.‚ÄúWhen you do, I want you to remember that it wouldn‚Äôt have made any difference to me. It‚Äôs never made any difference to me when it came to you. I‚Äôd still pick you. I‚Äôll always pick you.‚ÄùI\'ve read some reviews that say that the love triangle\'s fate is sealed after the first quarter of the book. But now, after reading it, I\'m not so sure. Especially after that second half and killer ending. I love Chaol with all my heart, but I can\'t help but hope that Celaena will end up with Dorian. Now, now, don\'t throw stones at me! It‚Äôs still aCinderellainspired book! They\'re both swoony guys, but I\'ve always loved Dorian a bit more. Might be because of the dark-haired, blue-eyed appearance. And possibly the arrogance. And the bookish and funny personality. Perhaps even the fact that he\'s a freaking prince.*dreamy sigh*‚ÄúIf you are captured, if you are hurt, you are beyond our reach. You will be entirely on your own.‚Äù‚ÄúI‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù‚ÄúBut I won‚Äôt be. Every day that you‚Äôre there, I will wonder what has become of you. I won‚Äôt.... I won‚Äôt forget you. Not for one hour.‚ÄùNehemia was such a great support for Celaena, even if she had her own agenda. The princess is one of those selfless characters that would give everything up for the sake of her people. She\'s fair, ambitious and dedicated. And she\'s the key-player that sets things in motion in this sequel. But in a gut-wrenching method that will surely have you shedding a few tears.The villain we love to hate: the King of Adarlan, Dorian\'s father. His plans turn out to be down-right evil and unnatural. I loathe that guy because he\'s so willing to exploit everyone around him for his own sake. I want himD.E.A.D.*guilty smile*As it was to be expected, we meet new characters. My favorite was Mort. Why? First of all, he\'s an ancienttalkingdoor knocker. Second of all, he\'s hilarious!When they left, Nehemia spent a few minutes studying Mort‚Äî mostly asking him questions about his creation spell, which he claimed to have forgotten, then claimed was too private, then claimed she had no business hearing.Archer Finn was hard to read, but I never trusted him behind all those pretty smiles and coward-like behavior. Never trust a courtesan. Oh, and of course, there\'s Baba Yellowlegs. Even the name gives you creeps. She\'s an old, manipulative witch whose favorite meal is consisted of young girls. Told you: creepy.The character development is really spectacular. You can see how Celaena, Chaol and Dorian grow. By the end of the novel, our heroine is not running from her past anymore; the Captain of the Guard is ready to sacrifice himself and face his father; and the Crown Prince starts to stand up to the King no matter the consequences.‚ÄúThank you for all that you have done for me, Dorian. Thank you for being my friend. For not being like the others.‚ÄùThe pace was definitely action driven. I\'m not kidding when I\'m saying that sooo much happened and some many plots started to unfold between my eyes. Crown of Midnight was a page-turner through and through and there was never a dull moment.‚ÄúHow long will you keep her here?‚Äù Dorian said, looking down the stairs.She had attacked the Captain of the Guard in front of his men. Worse than attacked.‚ÄúAs long as it takes,‚Äù Chaol said quietly.""For what?‚Äù‚ÄúFor her to decide not to kill us all.‚ÄùAnother think that surprised me was the fact that Celaena is keeping so many secrets I can\'t even keep count. There were two revelations regarding her: I suspected the one revealed in the end, but the other one totally caught me unprepared. Both are jaw-dropping twists that will completely change the outcome of her adventures.‚ÄúI‚Äôll come back,‚Äù she said quietly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll come back for you.‚ÄùThe world-building was exquisite! We learn so much more about Erilea, Adarlan and the history of the country. We delve deeper into the Fae magic. It\'s a top-notch high fantasy world, coupled with a darker atmosphere, mistery, magic and amazing characters. The result is a certain recipe for epicness, one that Sarah J. Mass gorgeously created with her mad writing skills.If you haven\'t started this series, I\'m begging you -- pick it upASAP. It\'s complex, emotional and completely captivating. You\'ll laugh, you\'ll cry, you\'ll swoon, you\'ll gasp in shock and you\'ll fall in love with the story.Crown of Midnightwas an excellent follow-up that might not end in a claw-your-yes-out sort of cliffhanger, but it will make you crave the next installment like air.

Others, you hear with your heart.‚ÄùTo say Sarah J. Maas stepped up her game in the second book of her‚ÄúThrone of Glass Series‚Äùmost certainly would be the understatement of the century. No, scratch that, it actually doesn‚Äôt even get close to the truth. XDI swear in comparison to the first book this truly was an action packed and suspenseful read! =)Alone the many awesome fight scenes and the countless revelations throughout the entire book were already enough to cause my head to spin! Plus Celaena finally lives up to her reputation as Adarlan‚Äôs best assassin and actually kills people, which was amazing and involuntarily made me love this even more! *lol*Yes, Sarah can write and her action scenes always had me at the edge of my seat. Once or twice I might have even been close to falling off of my chair, but that‚Äôs another matter for another day! ;-PFor now all you have to know is that‚ÄùCrown of Midnight‚Äùwas an awesome read and that it was able to keep me on my toes and considering how many books I already read, this certainly should speak for itself. ;-)Since I don‚Äôt really feel like talking aboutthe plot(you‚Äôll read plenty of it in my characters section aka The Spoilery Spoiler Section anyway) I‚Äôll do something completely mean and will only give you a few words:Celaena, Chaol, Dorian, The King, Roland, Kaltain, Nehemia, Archer, missions, blood, death, creepy, magic, dungeons, books and let‚Äôs not forget about Fleetfoot!There you go! *lol* Haha! Oh Jeez that‚Äôs so vague you‚Äôll hate me! XDWell, anyway! *smiles innocently*Let‚Äôs get to my favourite section!The characters:Do I still have to say it?! Yes? Okay! This is the aforementioned ‚ÄúSpoilery Spoiler Part‚Äù so if you don‚Äôt want to read quotes or spoilers or my crazy thoughts, you better stop now and never return. ;-P Don‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt warn you!Celaena:‚ÄùSome days, it feels like another person did those things. And most of those lives I‚Äôm glad I ended. No matter the cause, though, it ‚Äì it still takes away a little piece of you each time. So I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever forget them.‚ÄùCelaena is so kick-ass, I love her!!! We finally saw the relentless killer in her and I just couldn‚Äôt get enough of it! I thoroughly enjoyed all of the fighting scenes and the one with Baba Yellowlegs was definitely the best! XD I can‚Äôt wait to read more about those Ironteeth Witch Clans and I really hope they‚Äôll be a part of the other books! Aside from the action I probably enjoyed Celaena‚Äôs character development the most. She‚Äôs no longer afraid to show her true self and she doesn‚Äôt only open up to Chaol but also to Dorian. I can‚Äôt say how much I loved all those new revelations about her and the fact that she‚Äôs fae took me entirely by surprise. I definitely didn‚Äôt expect that and I was like‚ÄúWOAH WHAT?!!!‚Äùwhen I read it! I mean I always knew she had a secret and Sarah mentioned it often enough, I certainly didn‚Äôt expect it to be this kind of secret though!! *lol* I‚Äôm sure after the promise at Nehemia‚Äôs grave we can expect great things in the future and I‚Äôm so curious about Wendlyn; I immediately want to start with‚ÄúHeir of Fire‚Äù.‚ÄùI failed him,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIn every way that counted, I failed him.‚ÄùAnother long silence, then a sigh. ‚ÄúNot in one way.‚Äù Chaol said. ‚ÄúI bet he would have wanted you to survive ‚Äì to live. So you didn‚Äôt fail him, not in that regard.‚Äù‚ÄùI want you to know,‚Äù she whispered to the wind, to the earth, to the body far beneath her, ‚Äúthat you were right. You were right. I am a coward. And I have been running for so long that I‚Äôve forgotten what it is to stand and fight.‚Äù‚ÄùThe ship began moving. And Chaol ‚Äì the man she hated and loved so much that she could hardly think around him ‚Äì just stood there, watching her go.‚ÄùChaol:‚ÄùShe was a whirlwind of steel and blood. As he watched her cut through the men as though they were stalks of wheat in a field, he understood how she had gotten so close to touching Endovier‚Äôs wall that day. And at last ‚Äì after all these months ‚Äì he saw the lethal predator he‚Äôd expected to find in the mines. There was nothing human in her eyes, nothing remotely merciful. It froze his heart.‚ÄùAhh Chaol! My problem child! *sighs* I don‚Äôt hate him, actually I like him, butARGH!!!!He screwed up big time in this one and I just couldn‚Äôt believe what I read! I mean come on! You‚Äôre the Captain of the King‚Äôs Guard! You should be smarter than that!!! Seriously, in this book I really began to hate his loyalty to the king and it made me more than just angry that he never even thought about questioning the king‚Äôs orders! Chaol basically is the embodiment of the unthinking and unblinking soldier! Stupidly loyal to a fault!!! And that moment when he got kidnapped in his own domain?WHAT THE FREAKEDY FREAKING HELL?!Like: Are you kidding me!? I can‚Äôt help but wonder how he even became the Captain of the Guard. *lol* I‚Äôm so not impressed. Not at all! Plus he should have told Celaena about Nehemia, but he didn‚Äôt and that once again tells me that he still doesn‚Äôt trust her. At the end I felt kind of sad for him though. I mean he finally realised that he was blind and probably made the biggest mistake of his life. Unfortunately by then it was already too late to change anything about his misguided actions and he ended up suffering like crazy. Poor Chaol! =(‚ÄùOnce, Chaol might have argued. Once, he might have protested that his loyalty to the crown was his greatest asset. But that blind loyalty and obedience had started his descent.And it had destroyed everything.‚ÄùBut when Celaena walked out, leaving that damning will behind him, he didn‚Äôt even make it to his own room. He barely made it into an empty broom closet before the sobs hit.‚Äù‚ÄùBut he could do this for her. Even if he never saw her again, even if she abandoned her duties as King‚Äôs Champion and stayed with the Fae in Wendlyn forever ‚Äì as long as he knew that she was safe, that no one could hurt her ‚Ä¶ He‚Äôd sell his soul again and again for that.‚ÄùDorian:‚ÄùYou have power in you, Prince. More power than you realize.‚Äù She touched his chest, tracing a symbol there, too, and some of the court ladies gasped. But Nehemia‚Äôs eyes were locked on his. ‚ÄúIt sleeps,‚Äù she whispered, tapping his heart. ‚ÄúIn here. When the time comes, when it awakens, do not be afraid.‚Äù She removed her hand and gave him a sad smile. ‚ÄúWhen it is time, I will help you.‚ÄùMy charming and precious cutiepie!!!I love Dorian so damn much! He‚Äôs the best thing about the entire series and in‚ÄúCrown of Midnight‚Äùhe broke my heart. I suffered with him throughout the entire book and I really hate the idea that Sarah might make him a second Lucien. Neither of those two boys deserved what she put them through and I really hope she won‚Äôt continue to harm him in the next book. He‚Äôs just too pure for the world and he needs to be protected at all costs!!! Plus he‚Äôs amazing!!!I love the fact that he has raw magic in him and I see so much potential for the next few books! Still, his loneliness caused my heart to ache and I felt really sorry for him. He‚Äôs so alone and no one is there to help him, yet his first thought when he discovered that he had magic was that he needs to find out if his brother has it too. He wanted to protect Hollin and that‚Äôs so damn sweet! <33 Oh boy, how much I wanted to hug him when he frantically tried to hide his research in the library or when he was looking for Nehemia and waited in front of Celaena‚Äôs rooms. All this anger and despair - He doesn‚Äôt deserve it!!! Sarah, please have mercy on him!!!#TeamDorian forever and for always!!!!‚ÄùHow long have you been yearning for him? Was what he really wanted to ask. Damn him for caring. Damn him for every moment he‚Äôd spent with her.‚Äù‚ÄùHow about you spend a year in Calaculla, and when you‚Äôre done, you two can sit here and tell me about your plans for expansion.‚Äù‚ÄùSomething invisible slammed into the creature, sending it flying into the wall with a crunch. Gods. Dorian didn‚Äôt just have magic ‚Äì he had raw magic. The rarest, and deadliest, kind. Sheer undiluted power, capable of being shaped into whatever form the wielder desired.‚ÄùNehemia:‚ÄùI won‚Äôt deny that you have suffered, Elentiya, but there are thousands more who have also suffered ‚Äì and suffered more. And they do not sell themselves to the king to get what they, too, deserve. With each person you kill, I am finding fever and fewer excuses for remaining your friend.‚ÄùWHY SARAH!!!??Why did you have to kill Nehemia? She was such a lovely character and I didn‚Äôt expect her death! When Celaena found out about the King‚Äôs intentions I really thought that she‚Äôd be able to safe her or would at least come just in time to exchange some final words with her. But no! We found a dead Nehemia and Celaena never got a chance to fix things between them. T_T I hate it that they had an argument before she died and I really don‚Äôt like the way Nehemia had to die. I mean she didn‚Äôt even get a fighting scene. We‚Äôre presented with a fait accompli, which sucked! Well, at least in my opinion. So there‚Äôs that! Can‚Äôt say I feel sorry for Grave or Archer though. They had it coming and they should have known better than to mess with Celaena. *lol*‚ÄùI have grown up knowing the weight of my crown. When the king invaded Eyllwe all those years ago, I knew that I would someday have to make choices that would haunt me.‚Äù She cupped her forehead in a palm. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think it would be this hard. I cannot be in two places at once.‚Äù‚ÄùNehemia was gone. That vibrant, fierce, loving soul; the princess who had been called the Light of Eyllwe; the woman who had been a beacon of hope ‚Äì just like that, as if she were no more than a wisp of candlelight, she was gone.‚Äù‚ÄùBut no matter what I did, Elentiya, I want you to know that in the darkness of the past ten years, you were one of the bright lights for me. Do not let that light go out.‚ÄùKaltain and Roland:‚ÄùSometimes,‚Äù Kaltain said softly, and Celaena paused. ‚ÄúSometimes I think they brought me here. Not to marry Perrington, but for another purpose. They want to use me.‚ÄùI still don‚Äôt know what the king plans with Kaltain and Roland but whatever it is, it can‚Äôt be good! That thing in the dungeons underneath the clock tower was so creepy and I really don‚Äôt even want to know what else is locked up there! *shudders* There‚Äôs no doubt the King of Adarlan is up to something and I‚Äôm kind of worried about Kaltain‚Äôs fate. I have no idea where and how Roland comes into play, but I get the slight feeling he‚Äôs allied with the king. I mean yeah he helped Dorian but maybe that was all show? Who knows? I‚Äôll definitely watch those two closely from now on. ;-)""They encourage the crows to fly past here,"" Kaltain murmured, more to herself than to Celaena. ""And my headaches are worse every day. Worse and worse, and full of all those flapping wings.""The friendships & ships:Celaena & Dorian:‚ÄùShe deserved a loyal, brave knight who saw her for what she was and did not fear her. And he deserved someone who would look at him like that, even if the love wouldn‚Äôt be the same, even if the girl wouldn‚Äôt be her.So Dorian closed his eyes, and took another long breath. And when he opened his eyes, he let her go.‚ÄùThose two!!!I know they had troubles at the beginning but the friendship that formed between them is so perfect!!! I‚Äôm so happy that they were able to settle their differences and I love Dorian for letting her go! This was such a powerful scene and I‚Äôm so glad they eventually managed to become friends again! I loved it when Dorian told Celaena that she will always have a place with him and that she could come to his dorms whenever she needed something.THATis friendship!!!THATis trust!!! Oh gosh, I really hope Sarah won‚Äôt crush this again! *lol*‚ÄùTheir eyes met and held. A line stretched taut between them ‚Äì a moment of trust, and a promise of answers from both of them.‚Äù‚ÄùBut looking at Dorian as he smiled at her, this prince who was smart and thoughtful and kind, who inspired good men like Chaol to serve him ‚Ä¶Celaena wondered if Nehemia‚Äôs impossible, desperate dream of that court might yet come to pass.‚Äù‚ÄùThank you for all that you have done for me, Dorian. Thank you for being my friend. For not being like the others.‚Äù He paused, turning to face her. She kept her chin high, but her eyes were gleaming.‚ÄúI‚Äôll come back,‚Äù she said quietly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll come back for you.‚ÄùDorian & Chaol:Dorian‚Äôs lips were pursed, his face stony as he quietly said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been busy, too.‚Äù The Crown Prince turned his horse away, heading in another direction, but paused. ‚ÄúChaol,‚Äù he said, looking over his shoulder. Dorian‚Äôs eyes were frozen, his jaw clenched. ‚ÄúTreat her well.‚Äù*sigh* Their friendship suffered so much in this book and I really wish this wouldn‚Äôt have happened. I loved that they were so close and could talk about everything, but I guess now that Celaena got into their way things between them might never be the same again. >_< It‚Äôs sad that Dorian can‚Äôt tell Chaol about his powers but I definitely understand why he‚Äôs so cautious. I mean Chaol was always so damn loyal to the king and that actually makes it more than just hard to trust him. If I‚Äôd be in Dorian‚Äôs situation, I wouldn‚Äôt tell him as well. =(‚ÄùDorian could have gleefully killed Chaol‚Äôs father for disowning him, refusing even to see Chaol when he brought his family to Rifthold for an important meeting with the king. Even though Chaol had never said it, Dorian knew the scars went deep.‚ÄùCelaena & Chaol:‚ÄùI know you can look after yourself. But I worry because I care. Gods help me, I know I shouldn‚Äôt, but I do. So I will always tell you to be careful, because I will always care what happens.‚ÄùI can‚Äôt believe Sarah used 1 ¬Ω books to build this relationship and then decided to thoroughly sink the ship! Oh wait! I actuallyCANbelieve it! *LOL* After reading ACOTAR nothing should surprise me anymore! Still, I mean I never was the biggest fan of this ship (everyone who read my review of ToG knows that) but I at least would have wanted them to be happy for a while. And the way it happened!!I can understand that Celaena was angry at Chaol but I really didn‚Äôt get why she acted the way she did. I mean at first she‚Äôs all in love with Chaol and jumps to his rescue because he‚Äôs been kidnapped and all she wants is to save him becauseshe loves him oh so muchand then in the next moment she‚Äôs at his throat and almost kills him! Hell! She didn‚Äôt even give him a chance to explain himself! Yes, I‚Äôm aware this would have changed nothing about Nehemia‚Äôs death, but I think if she would have let him talk, she‚Äôd have realised that he didn‚Äôt know about the king‚Äôs plans. She wronged poor Chaol so much and even though he made bad decisions I still feel sorry for him. Because let‚Äôs face it, he might have never trusted Celaena but he certainly loved her deeply. T_TWhat a shipwreck!!!RIP!‚ÄùShe knew his every move and he knew hers, as though they‚Äôd been dancing this waltz together all their lives. Faster, never faltering, never breaking her stare.The rest of the world quieted into nothing. In that moment, after ten long years, Celaena looked at Chaol and realized she was home.‚Äù‚ÄùIt had snuck up on him, this pain and terror and rage at the thought of anyone else with her. Every look, every word from her ‚Ä¶ He didn‚Äôt even know when it had started.‚Äù‚ÄùBut he didn‚Äôt know how to get her in line. He didn‚Äôt know how to fix what had been broken. Both inside her, and between them.‚ÄùAll told I really loved‚ÄúCrown of Midnight‚Äùand I can‚Äôt wait to dive into‚ÄúHeir of Fire.‚ÄùSince this was another buddy read with myprecious GemI actually enjoyed the experience even more! XD I loved our discussions about the plot and characters and the fact Gem is such a hardcore Chaol fan only addedfire to the fuelto the fun. *lol*Let‚Äôs pick up book 3 soon!!! I promise I won‚Äôt talk bad about Chaol! Well, I‚Äôll try not to! Scout‚Äôs honor! ;-P'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is how you write a fantasy novel. Great characters, development, evolution, and revelations. Magic used intelligently, and my personal favourite action. I could not put the book down. I like the way that they characters have their responsibilities and jobs, but that is not all that defines them. Celaena has no problem hacking up body parts, but she is still a girl who loves to shop. I think even though she is an assassin, she sees herself as more of an avenger. She will avenge her friends no matter the cost.The story Celaena Sardothien won the right to become the King\'s Champion (personal Assassin) since then, she has been charged with dispatching a number of his enemies. In many cases, she brings back trophies in the form of severed heads and family insignias (rings) still attached to the hands. However, having no love for the King she has been, she has been helping his enemies get away and fake their deaths. The problem is she is too good at it, and even her closest friends and biggest supporters believe she has completely turned over to the dark side. Then she is given a target who intersected with her former life in Assassins Keep (Archer), a courtesan (prostitute). This simple assignment sends a ripple effect affecting Celaena and everyone she cares about. They also fill in some history; there is a more detailed account of what Celaena did the day she ""snapped"" in Endovier. There are also hints that Celaena knows exactly who betrayed her. In the next book I am begging for a showdown with the King of Assassins, but so far Celaena has already made enough enemies to keep her busy for a good long time, which is great news for a long series. The only thing I did find annoying in this book is the right characters suddenly appearing exactly the right moment, but will all the fate and prophecies in the book, this could be easily explained.I am a fan of Sarah\'s writing style, having chapters of different lengths, and almost chunking the chapters so information is easy to take in and break up for me. This might be a fairy tale setting but that is where the similarities stop, this is more the grim story tales type of book, with grizzly deaths, torcher, and harsh language (even though the characters do not swear in print, they usually ""unleash a string of curse""). I love the Throne of Glass universe. There are references made to not only the first novel but the eBook prequels as well.This book is a lot more action packed to the first novel, there HUGE revelations about Celaena and Dorian, (who have a Luke and Leia type relationship), as well as the forces that are using them. It\'s a great book. Start it, and you will not be able to put it down. You do not need to have read the previous stories to enjoy this one, but they do help, and after reading this one, you will want to go back and read the others.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '2.5 starsAnswer me something.

I can handle the shoes and shopping because a girl has the right to look damn good while disemboweling enemies.

Chaol is an overprotective fucknuckle who can suck it.Calaena still does stupid crap, like exploring without backup or sufficient research. Her obsession with chocolate cake is goddamn annoying. It\'s too cutesy and feels like Maas\'s trying too hard. Each time it came up, I felt like paraphrasing Amy fromGone Girl: No one fucking likes chocolate cake that much.Midway, as I was finally warming up to Calaena, she turns into an uber Mary Sue.She\'s part Fae, the lost queen of Terrasen, and has magical powers. For fuck\'s sake. Choose one, Maas. Don\'t be greedy.I originally warmed up to Calaena because of Maas\'s excellent portrayal of loss and depression. It\'s not resolved in a chapter or two; it\'s an underlining theme that affects the latter half of the book. I especially like thatCalaena doesn\'t forgive Chaol right away. Nehemia dying wasn\'t his fault, but her anger and distrust is justified.I also liked Dorian\'smagicsubplot. It\'s one of the few things in Crown of Midnight that made me sit up, and partially why I think he\'d be good with Calaena: ice and fire.He\'s a way better love interestandfriend. I don\'t care if it\'s planet-aligning true love, you don\'t sneak around with your best friend\'s ex-girlfriend. *cough*Chaol*cough* I especially like the part where Dorian sees them dancing and chooses to let her go. It was a sweet, poignant moment.

The second installment doth not disappoint! Our heroine is back as the King\'s Champion so expect action galore.

Her hair pulled back in a long braid that fell into the folds of that dark cloak she was always wearing. She was a beautiful wrath ‚Ä¶This book turned up in my room dressed in dark robes, whispered the first few sentences like a secret incantation and before I could utter\'By the Wyrd\'I was under its spell (not saying that this book has magical powers, but this book has magical powers . . . in fact I\'m pretty sure Sarah J. Maas is Fae). It swept me down a path of ink and words, and every time I thought it had given me its all,\'surely it can\'t get better than this . . . surely,\'it would open its robes to unveil yet more wondrous things.Then it took a boot to my love for female assassins and pushed hard and now I\'m sitting at the bottom of a canyon singing to myself:O\' hither she came ,and stole my heart,henceforth I shall never be the same,your jewels to her you will part,or so is the King\'s claim,a jewelley thief?

I am, as we speak, arranging to become a fictional character so I canstalkmeet you.The Captain of the Guard is as strong and fierce as he was in ToG but in this installment we get to see more of his softer side. The beautiful friendship between Celaena and him takes front stage in CoM. Sarah really takes the opportunity to flesh out their relationship in all it\'s banter-teasing-tension glory. There\'s talk of books(sigh)and late nights spent next to the fireplace.While Chaol\'s compassion and loyalty are beacons of light in the darkness of the Royal Court, the question is where exactly do his loyalties lie? With the Crown he has fought so hard to protect? Or with his friends who have made the glass castle a home for him?""Why are you crying?""""Because,"" she whispered, her voice shaking, ""you remind me of how the world ought to be.

Dorian isn\'t your garden variety indestructible, white horse riding, fierce, saves-the-day prince. Instead he can be fragile and confused and he is made all the more strong for it. Shocking isn\'t it that boys can experience the same emotions as female heroines(cough)?\xa0Sarah doesn\'t kick him to the curb either. Rather another layer of mystery is added when strange things start happening to him . . . things that put his life at risk.The most refreshing aspect of this trio\'s relationship is that Celaena is not turned into a Mary Sue mess in the face of these male ""interests."" Four for you Sarah J. Maas.I am not at all done with these characters and I\'m ready for their next adventure. CoM had it all:magic, adventure, epic fights, romance, mysteryandsecrets. . . so many dirty little secrets that aren\'t as neatly tucked into the nooks and crannies of the Royal Court as their owners would like to think. The ending left me as hungry for more as when I started.This series is going to go wondrous places in the next instalment and I can barely wait._____________________________PRE-REVIEW: 30/09/2012:2013?!

El estilo de Sarah J Maas no es el m√°s complejo del mundo, pero tampoco es una lectura sencilla y ligera. Sin embargo,consigue que me trague hasta el m√°s m√≠nimo punto para descubrir cada detalle(exceptuando c√≥mo se viste Celaena, que me da un poco igual).La manera en la que Maas consigue sumergirte en la historia es espectacular, incluso con personajes que te puedan caer mal. Simplemente est√°s enganchado y quieres saber m√°s y m√°s.Vamos viendo en esta segunda parte de la serieTrono de Cristalc√≥morealmente hemos estado un poco enga√±adxs.A ver, yo sab√≠a que hab√≠a m√°s... cosas, pero la forma en la que la historia va evolucionando est√° muy bien hecha. S√≠, comenzamos con una esclava/asesina profesional y su propia venganza para el rey que acab√≥ con la vida de tantos inocentes. Y s√≠, ella es despiadada y tiene un plan, y sabe sabotear al monarca.Pero tenemos siempre como ruido de fondo la magia, la extinci√≥n de esta, las Marcas de Wyrd, tierras lejanas que amenazan con rebelarse... Y ese ruido de fondo poco a poco va ganando fuerza.¬øEsto es una historia sobre las clases sociales en un mundo de alta fantas√≠a o... es otra cosa?EnCorona de medianocheveremos c√≥mo las tornas cambian,y que el tema simplista de ser asesina se va entremezclando con otras cosas mucho m√°s interesantes, profundas y m√°gicas. Es una muy buena transici√≥n, aunque s√© que vendr√°n cosas m√°s incre√≠bles.Esta saga tiene algo que engancha mucho, y es que la protagonista nada entre dos aguas.A veces, no son tan claras, pero en otras ocasiones s√≠.Dorian. Chaol. Son dos caras de la misma moneda, ¬øo no?Yo como lector no dejaba de preguntarme qu√© pasaba por sus cabezas, y aunque a veces tenemos una breve mirada hacia ellas, me siguen pareciendo enigm√°ticos y misteriosos. Y honestamente, es dif√≠cil decidirse.No me cae mal ninguno de ellos(incluso hablando de traiciones, como en este libro), porque siento que son personajes demasiado atados a sus actuales condiciones de vida, actuando lo mejor que pueden dentro de un marco opresivo que les ahoga. ¬øCu√°l es la decisi√≥n correcta en un mundo corrupto de por s√≠?Me gusta much√≠simo c√≥mo se plantean sus conflictos morales y personales para con Celaena o el reino de Adarlan.Como ya he comentado,el estilo de Sarah es cautivador. Engancha much√≠simo, pese a no ser una lectura sencilla.Ni las palabras, ni la forma de narrar son algo propio de una novela pensada para ser adictiva y ya est√°. Tiene un componente muy literario, de profundidad, de lentitud, pero nunca deja de contar cosas. Todo lo que narra sirve para algo, incluso la m√≠nima tonter√≠a que menciona de refil√≥n.La forma en la que el misterio es planteado en torno a Elena, su Ojo y las Marcas de Wyrd me ha dejado con el culo torcido.Es un constante ""creo que va a ir por aqu√≠"", pero termina yendo en la direcci√≥n opuesta, y luego te sorprende a√∫n m√°s, y sigues descubriendo m√°s y m√°s cosas que no te esperas. Honestamente, unas cartas muy bien jugadas.No entiendo, por cierto, el odio que algunas personas le tienen a Celaena Sardothien. ¬°NO LO ENTIENDO!Me parece uno de los personajes m√°s complejos de la literatura juvenil actual. Y es que no solo es compleja, sino bien construida, y adem√°s -que es lo m√°s importante- no es buena. Tiene su parte mala, vengativa, llena de malicia. Que lo use para lo que t√∫ consideres el bien o el mal es otra cosa, pero sus decisiones se basan en, s√≠, por qu√© no, momentos calientes o llenos de rabia. Y no hay nada malo en ello: es una maldita asesina.Me parece que tiene una personalidad clara y perfectamente dibujada. Es inteligente y llena de poder para enga√±ar, que es un soplo de aire fresco entre tanto personaje heroico o \'bueno\'.Corona de medianochenos habla m√°s y mejor de la historia de este universo. EnTrono de Cristalten√≠amos una buena introducci√≥n a ello, pero aqu√≠, descubriendo m√°s sobre el pasado y la magia que habitaba este continente, observamos que hay mucho m√°s que contar y descubrir.Que si el Reino de las Brujas, el circo con Piernas Amarillas, los dioses antiguos, llaves m√°gicas... Es como que vamos viendo poco a poco un poquito m√°s, y ese poquito expande much√≠simo el universo planteado en el primer libro.Lo que m√°s me fascina de todo, es que cuadra y encaja perfectamente con lo contado desde el primer momento. Todo tiene el m√°s absoluto sentido, y se nota hacia d√≥nde ir√° a parar la autora. No puedo estar m√°s emocionado.Para m√≠ ha sido una de las mejores lecturas del a√±o,y aunque he tenido malos momentos con este libro (yeah,un paroncito lector o pasajes que me aburr√≠an hasta comprender por qu√© eran necesarios), sin duda lo guardar√© con muy buen recuerdo por haberme arrancado esa ilusi√≥n de mi yo lector de doce a√±os con libros de fantas√≠a.Necesito m√°s, quiero m√°s.As√≠ que seguir√© ya mismo conHeredera de fuegopara saciar mi sed.

I have to confess, even with the popular opinion being the series getting better with each book, I had my doubts. I couldn\'t imagine the author breaking away from her original portrayer of Celaena considerably. So, though she was more or less the same, it came as a pleasant surprise, to see she is now sharing the story with two other POVs. Though the Crown of Midnight was not a huge improvement, this is certainly a step in right direction.""Some of the things you hear with your ears. Others, you hear with your heart.""Aside from having multiple POVs, there isn\'t a whole lot different about this book: writing style, world building, characters, are nearly identical to the first, and moves along the same plot. And the first half did make me think this second book was not improved at all compared to the first. But then, right around the halfway point, an incident completely changed things, which led to a highly eventful, and entertaining second half. All the characters went through some dramatic changes after this point, and finally brought down some of Celaena\'s conflicting (and annoying) character traits. I also appreciate the use of multiple POVs. I know this would probably change in future, but in this second book, I think Dorian was my favorite character. But after how the author changes the characters\' actions spontaneously(like Chaol\'s), I wouldn\'t be surprised to see that change in future books.""You\'d be surprised how easily men see what they want to see.""The underlying plot of the story is still not clear, even by the end of this second book. But considering there are seven book in this series, I guess it would be this way, at least until the fourth or fifth book. Hopefully, the plotlines would be streamlined soon enough, so that the final books will not have a lot of loose ends. Overall, I liked the second book more than the first, and for me, it earned a complete star (from 2.5-stars to 3.5), and I\'m hoping to see the growth consistent.""You must learn to ask the right questions before you can receive right answers.""'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'sjm did Nehemia so dirty in this book'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'InfinityI love this series with all of my heart until the end of time stars!! ‚ôæÔ∏è‚≠ê‚ùù The best lies were always mixed with truth. ‚ùû‚ùù Sometimes you have to break before you can become something new . ‚ùû‚ùù But death was her curse and her gift, and death had been her good friend these long, long years. ‚ùûWell, to be honest...

And, to be fair, on one of my editions I have a 5 star rating and on another a 4 star rating- clearly I was really conflicted with this one when I read it the first time.Understandably so - because SO much happens in this book. There\'s amazing fight scenes, action sequences, the assassin starts assassin-ing and solidifies why she is such a bad ass. SJM can surely write the hell out of an action scene. I already knew what was going to happen this time so I wasn\'t on the edge of my seat this go round but I was most definitely tense.For me, Crown of Midnight is the crucial turning point in the series. This is where the original trio expands and allegiances shift as loyalties are tested. This is where we finally glimpse the bigger picture, the beginning of the end. Everything changes from here on out.The story expands to include new characters and new worlds as the true antagonist forces reveal themselves.

Amidst the brutal war and magical creatures, finding solace in letters, in each other's company seems to fill them with hope and something more.Theworld buildingis not too complex, it might seem that way in the beginning but the author sets the stage brilliantly. Never info dumping, she paces the history of the towns, the platoons, the creatures and the gods-Enva and Dacrebeautifully. The typewriters sure are an interesting feature. It came so naturally and was so easy to read, love when authors do it right. Thepacingis consistent, not too fast not too slow. I was so mesmerized by her writing, the story and the characters, I was envisioning it all and didn't know where the time went.One of the underrated things is the way the author dealt with heavy topics-war, grief and loss of lifeplay a big part in this book. So if any of the things feel uncomfortable, do reconsider as it is a very emotional book. The way it's depicted and the sheer raw emotion written wasbeautifully heartbreaking to read.There were side characters who were just there for a few pages but they made me cry. They made an impact.

Cannot wait to get to it, have high hopes""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""How did the promise of a war between gods turn into a middling historical fiction with a lackluster romance and nary a whiff of fantasy? I'm honestly a bit stunned.I went intoDivine Rivalswith high expectations. I'd seen the gushing reviews and the deluge of 5-star ratings. And I'd gotten a taste for romantasy and I wanted more. In fact, I was so certain I was going to love this that I saved it for just the right moment when I'd need a little extra zing in my reading repertoire.So I settled myself in, ready to be swept away in a fantasy of epic proportions, with an enemies-to-lovers romance for the ages. And how can it not be amazing, with gods at war and two rivaling journalists who don't fight with their swords but with their words. Yes! Except no, because this didn't really deliver on any of it.Instead, what I got was more or less a historical fiction. The fantasy element is so diminutive, I felt like I could blink and miss it. You see, the gods were unhappy with each other, and they're recruiting humans to fight in their war. And that's pretty much it for the fantasy part. Oh, and there's some magic in old houses and typewriters. You can see how that would be disappointing for a reader expecting, well, more than that.The majority of the story is told from Iris's perspective and she never really gelled into an interesting character for me. At every step, she does what you would expect a character to do, nothing more, nothing less. Her brother is fighting in the war, so she misses him. She sees an opportunity to join the war effort, so she does. There's a cute boy at the office, so she's attracted to him. But there's another nice boy she writes with, so she's attracted to him too. At no point did she surprise me in any way. I found Roman to be the more compelling character, but his perspective is only a little bit here and there.As for the romance, it was serviceable but ultimately uninspiring. There was no real chemistry, no banter, no spark, nothing that made me swoon or crack a smile. The majority of it played out via Iris and Roman's letters to each other, and they felt distinctly YA. The writing was deep in the way of teenagers, but much ado about nothing for old folks like me. In fact, it reminded me of AOL chat logs from back in the day. I wonder if I were to dig up my own from my teenage days, it would come up similarly bland and overwrought.That isn't to say I didn't enjoy any of it because I did. But I kept waiting for that moment when the words I'm reading on the page would turn into an immersive experience, and it never did. Every element in here‚Äîthe war, the fantasy, the characters, their writing, the romance‚Äîwas pleasant enough to while away a few hours, but in that take it or leave it kind of way.No one's more disappointed than me. Compared to what I had imagined in my head, this story paled in comparison. But to be fair, part of that was my fault. What I wanted and what I got were complete opposites. I'm a huge fan of romance and fantasy, which this isn't really, and not a fan of wartime historical fiction, which is all this is.For all my complaints, I did get some enjoyment out of it. And since it's a duology and I already own the second book, I'll go ahead and finish the series. Fingers crossed that the second book has more of the exciting elements I'm looking for.~~~~~~~~~~~~‚úßConnect with me‚úßInstagram‚úßThis was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

But there‚Äôs also a small voice in the back of my mind, a voice that tells me, ‚ÄòYou will miss so much by being so guarded.‚Äùher mind is spectacular, she talks about how much she was hungry, not just for food but for sober conversations with her mother. and the way she uses words; she ‚Äòbled‚Äô herself in her articles and letters, not having motivation and describing the blank page as ‚Äònothing more than stars and smoke and word pressed on a page‚Äô, her writing to roman but also writingfor herself, her understanding how close she can be to people, yet how far away and lonely she can fell.. she is so mature and i get chills every time we get a scope of her articles and letters.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you realize how strong you are, because sometimes strength isn‚Äôt swords and steel and fire, as we are so often made to believe.

The sweet romance? The story? Was it the fact that, despite not being part of the age group this was targeted at, I saw myself in both the main characters and could relate to their personal arc, both individually and as a couple?I have no idea, but if I had to try a guess, I\'d say it\'s simply a combination of all these things, plus the fact that Rebecca Ross is a crazy talented author.I\'ve had the chance to discover her just recently, after reading a book that\'d been on my tbr since 2017, and I\'m glad to conclude she\'s gotten even better with time and experience.Divine Rivals is abook I recommend going into blindly and one I definitely can\'t see anyone savoring slowly. Once you get into it, stopping is as hard as breathing under water.Rooting for the main characters to find themselves will become a new hobby, but rooting for them to find happiness by finding each other, will become an obsession.The progression from rivals to lovers is so smooth, almost soothing in its naturality.The setting is atmospheric, described so perfectly you can almost smell the stinging scent of gunpowder, hear the crinkle of the paper and the click of Iris and Roman\'s writing machine\'s keys.I don\'t know why, but while reading it, I couldn\'t stop thinking of one of my favorite movies,Un long dimanche de fian√ßailles. They have really similar vibes and not because they both take place during a war and tell the story of two very unfortunate lovers, but also because of the gray-ish undertones, the raw portrayal of reality, and the bittersweet romance.I like to consider myself pretty experienced when it comes to the reading scene, but those last pages made me feel like I was on a literal rollercoaster, even though I kind of saw it all coming.I didn\'t expect the pain to be so powerful, probably. It wasn\'t until the end that I realized just how invested I am in the magical realism of this story and the delicious pain that comes with this romance.Speaking of romance. I\'m at a loss of words for how perfect it plainly was.These two simply can\'t not be together. THEY CAN\'T.Roman is adorable, a real gentleman and the most cinnamon roll to ever roll, but for me, Iris stole the show. I admire her so much and my heart cried for how strong and brave she always was, despite everything she had to endure.I can\'t wait for the sequel to come out, even tho, I\'ll admit, I am also a little scared of what will and could happen in it.I hope that, if Rebecca Ross eventually decides to break my heart with Ruthless Vows, she wrecks it neatly so that it\'ll have the strenght to heal properly.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'world building ?

I went into it knowing that it is listed as a YA fantasy but didn\'t expect to fall in love with it this much! I had seen so many good things about this, but the reviews just don\'t do it justice. This has become one of my favorite reads for this year!Divine Rivals is the first book in the Letters of Enchantment duet. This is my first book by Rebecca Ross, and I fell in love with it from the very first word, which surprised me since I usually don\'t enjoy third person. Her writing is so beautiful and poetic that it just captured me. Though this is a fantasy, there are some missing pieces to the world building, but as I was reading, I completely overlooked it due to the romance that was present. It\'s a slow burn, work place academic rivals to lovers, where he falls first and harder this always makes me swoon so hard, romantacy that is emotional with angst, tension, grief, death and so much pain that I hadn\'t been expecting.Iris Winnow and Roman Kitt are two young rival journalists. They work at the same newspaper the Oath Gazette and find themselves competing for the same columnist position. While the rivalry between them grows, so does a war that is between the two gods, Dacre and Enva. The two find solace within each other through two magical typewrites that are linked through their letters. Iris begins sharing her daily thoughts and her deepest griefs, and he does in return.""Sometimes I‚Äôm afraid to love other people. Everyone I care about eventually leaves me, whether it‚Äôs death or war or simply because they don‚Äôt want me.""""I realize that people are just people, and they carry their own set of fears, dreams, desires, pains, and mistakes. I can‚Äôt expect someone else to make me feel complete; I must find it on my own.""Iris Winnowis so strong, brave, and just precious and needs to be protected at all costs. I absolutely adore this woman. She\'s so mature for her young age and has so much to deal with in her everyday struggles, but she doesn\'t let it affect the way she carries herself and cares for others. I was so happy that she found her own family since all the people she\'s loved have left her in one way or another.\xa0 I just want to wrap my arms around her and give her the biggest hug.""But just in case you were wondering‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll gladly read whatever you write.""‚ÄúYou mentioned the other day that you think I‚Äôm only here to ‚Äòoutshine‚Äô you. But that‚Äôs the furthest thing from the truth. I broke my engagement, quit my job, and traveled six hundred kilometers into war- torn land to be with you, Iris.‚ÄùRoman C. Kittis grumpy and stubborn in the beginning, but when the layers start to peel back and we are left with the sweetest, kindest, gentleman that I swear you will ever meet. He had me absolutely swooning. His life seems so perfect from the outside, but he has so many struggles that make me love him even more. I won\'t go into detail as I want you to fall in love with him as I did. He goes through great lengths for Iris to show how much she means to him and cares for her. I mean, he stands outside her door and waits for her to lock it before he leaves. He raises the bar for real men, and I\'ve just added a new book boyfriend to the long list.""He didn‚Äôt want to live in a world without her and her words.""""She couldn‚Äôt bear to live in a world without him.""""‚ÄúI think you and I are simply better together, Kitt,‚Äù""Their names would be entwined‚ÄîRoman and Iris or Winnow and Kitt because could you truly have one without the other?""RomanIrisare the definition of soulmates. Their chemistry is so palpable from the very beginning, even as they were still rivals. Iris gave Roman the following nicknames Roman Cheeky Kitt. Roman Cantankerous Kitt. Roman Conceited Kitt and I loved them all. They had me giggling and kicking my feet. The way that he would do anything for her and the love he has for her words had me on my knees swooning. Their love for each other was felt through every moment on the pages. And the letters they wrote to each other are everything and so much more! They were making up some of my favorite parts. I need someone to write me love letters NOW!Side charactersI absolutely adored the love and found family that Marisol, Attie, and Keegan shared with Iris. They are the family that Iris never knew she would need. The way that they became close knit so quickly and will always look out for and do anything for one another is so precious. Now Iris\' mother Aster and her brother Forest I\'m not sure how I feel about them. They both did things that I couldn\'t fully agree with. I\'m hoping for some redemption from Forest for what he did in the next book.""It‚Äôs odd, how quickly life can change, isn‚Äôt it? How one little thing like typing a letter can open a door you never saw. A transcendent connection. A divine threshold.""That cliffhanger has me feeling so much. I was not expecting that ending at all.

I mean how could I not whenRebecca\'s writing is this beautiful and exquisitethat I have no words to describe it. She just became one of my favourite authors with this book only. I loved the wayRebecca dealt with heavy topics like grief, loss of loved ones to war, healing and everything.The characters were well written that I could feel every emotion they felt.The connection between the main characters and side characterswas amazing. I liked Attie and Marisol and they both were amazing side characters.‚ÄúI realize that people are just people, and they carry their own set of fears, dreams, desires, pains, and mistakes.

I mean its essential if its a rivals to lovers book.You know whats better than a book written in third pov?A well-written book in third pov and Rebecca just proved it.And I need more of Roman\'s povs but mostly I need the scene in his pov where Iris had to sit in his lap for 3 hours while they were travelling ü§≠‚ÄúShe was glaring at him now. That fire in her eyes could have brought him to his knees.‚ÄùThe fantasy and the world building about the gods in their world was a bit underdeveloped.It was more about people and their fears related to war and how they fought and survived. Their world divided in two parts- Dacre\' s followers and those who were called upon by the goddess Enva to fight her wars. There was a little story mentioned about Dacre and Enva\'s feud and also the other gods but I wanted to know more about Dacre and Enva\'s story and exactly what happened between them that led to this war. And I still don\'t understand that why Enva was not their fighting in the war like Dacre was doing that. But I\'m also hoping we get all the answers in the sequel.‚û∏ Iris WinnowI love this girl.She is so archer coded üèπI loved reading her povs the most and as much as her inner monologues were painful they were also so damn relatable. She\'s been through the worst but I admire her for her strength, her kindness and resilience. She\'s just 18 but she\'s so mature and brave and I liked we saw her growth throughout the book. I saw her struggles and how she grew out of them and always found a way to be there for others and her family. I was also happy that she now has her own found family. Even if she lost everything she got a job as a war correspondent because she wanted to see her brother. She isone of the best FMCs\'I\'ve had a chance to read about this year.‚ÄúI rarely share this part of my life with others, but I want to tell it to you now. A piece of armor, because I trust you. A glint of falling steel, because I feel safe with you.‚Äù‚û∏ Roman Carver KittYes I\'m obsessed withRoman Cheeky Kittor was itRoman Cantankerous KittorRoman Conceited Kitt?!Whatever it was I just love this man so much. He is such a sweetheart and perfect in every way. He was a bit grumpy in the start but that was also hot.He\'s just 19 and well mannered and he waited for Iris to lock her door.I mean no real man would ever do this and its the basic thing everyone should know about. He is intelligent, charming and also witty. Where do I find him because I wanna marry him!! The way he fell for Iris and then took care for her whenever he could and the way he shared his story and his secrets with her even though he was a bit reticent to share them at first. I loved it.‚ÄúYour letters have been a light for me to follow. Your words? A sublime feast that fed me on days when I was starving. I love you, Iris.‚Äù‚ï∞‚îà‚û§ Their relationshipThey had been working and competing against each other for the same position but they always had this spark between them and this undeniable chemistry.The rivals to lovers wasn\'t there muchbecause they were already attracted towards each other but I loved that they still bickered and bantered even after felling in love with each other. Roman brings out the fire in Iris and he protected her with his life everytime.‚ÄúGoing easy on me, then?‚Äù He arched a brow. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs surprising. We‚Äôre supposed to duel to the death.‚Äù‚ÄúHas anyone ever told you that you squint when you lie?‚Äù His scowl only deepened.‚ÄúNo, but only because no one has spent as much time looking at me as you do, Winnow.‚ÄùThe letters they shared, the secrets and pain they wrote about in those letters, the way they let their armor fall one by one to be vulnerable with each other, the way they earned each others\' trust, the way Roman followed her to the war sight to be with her, their morning runs, the way they fell in love with each other, the way their loved grew stronger and stronger everyday. It was just mesmerisingly beautiful.They truly are ‚ú®Ô∏èSOULMATES‚ú®Ô∏è‚ÄúI broke my engagement, quit my job, and traveled six hundred kilometers into war-torn land to be with you, Iris.‚ÄùTheir love was just so sweet and wholesome and aching and even the war couldn\'t taint it.Did everything between them was rushed after they fell in love?Yes.Did I mind it?Absolutely Not.Because it was war time and they didn\'t even knew if they had a chance to see each other next morning, so they did what they could do and it was perfect and reasonable. They can\'t just wait for the war to be over or be adults in their early 20s to get married when they already saw the brutal reality of war and what it could do to people.‚ÄúYou and I ‚Ä¶ we need to stay together. We‚Äôre better this way.‚Äù‚ÄúI am coming to love him, in two different ways. Face to face, and word to word.‚ÄùThe ending completely shattered my heart in pieces.Why would Rebecca did this to me. They just found their happiness after so much pain and trauma and Rebecca just ripped it away from them and left them with so many regrets and pain. Iris couldn\'t even tell him how much she loved him and that asshole brother of her didn\'t even tried to save Roman?? I hate Forest and I don\'t believe a word he said and Rebecca better give us a happy ending for them in book 2 or I\'ll riot ü§∫‚Äî Some other beautiful quotes ‚Äî‚û∏ ‚ÄúIt takes courage to let down your armor, to welcome people to see you as you are. Sometimes I feel the same as you: I can‚Äôt risk having people behold me as I truly am.

I went into this book without really knowing what it was about, other than that it\'s a YA fantasy and super popular. What I wasn\'t expecting was howbeautifullywell written this book is. This book made me feel like I was wrapped in a warm blanket and Rebecca Ross\'s words gave me a big hug the whole time.To me, the concept of this book felt like it was a mix ofThe Hating Game, Beach Read and the Book Thiefwith elements of a dystopian fantasy.‚òÖThe plot‚òÖThis book follows Iris and Kitt who are both reporters working together and competing for the position of columnist at a newspaper called the Oath Gazette. This book is set in a historical period and a war between the gods Dacre and Enva is escalating and getting close to their homes in Oath. Iris is less fortunate and is experiencing hardship while Kitt initially appears to be a well educated, high society pretty boy with a sense of entitlement. The twist? Both Iris and Kitt have magical typewriters that send letters to each other and Iris doesn\'t know who the recipient is.‚ï∞‚™ºThoughtsI was tossing up giving this book between 4 and 5 stars. Overall, I think the plot was probably 4 stars. I found it incredibly interesting and a unique take on a fantasy book intertwined with a historical fiction/romance. For a fantasy book, some people might find the world building wasn\'t massively present but I personally didn‚Äôt think it needed to be as it wasn\'t the main focus of this book. This book was received exactly the way it was intended to and was so much more than just another fantasy or romance book. The writing was a masterpiece and pushed this book to 5 stars for me.I loved that Rebecca didn\'t try to overwhelm the characters with a heroism or saviour complex concerning the war like most fantasy books would have done. By making Iris and Kitt correspondents you experienced the war and its effects through a raw lens. This book speaks to larger social issues, the importance of appreciating what you have, processing grief and shows the characters strength and resilience. Most importantly, this book showcasesthe power of words.The letterswere my favourite part about this entire book, you just have to read them for yourself to appreciate this.‚òÖIris Winnow‚òÖIris Enchanting Winnow, Iris Ethereal Winnow, Iris Exquisite Winnow, Iris Elizabeth Winnow.Ohh Iris I just wanted to give her a big hug the whole time. This poor girl went through so much at just 18 years old and was so emotionally mature. She had a lot of insecurity and had a hard time believing anyone could love her or do something kind for her without thinking they were making fun of her. She was so strong and compartmentalised her feelings to help others and do what needed to be done without question but she also had the ability to be so open to Kitt about her struggles and feelings. Her vulnerability when she had every reason not to be was so refreshing.""I am so afraid. And yet I long to be vulnerable and brave when it comes to my own heart.""‚òÖRoman Kitt‚òÖRoman Condescending Kit, Roman Upperclass Kit, Roman Confounded Kit, Roman Competitive Kit, Roman Chaffing Kit, Roman Cheeky Kit, Roman Cantankerous Kit, Roman Conceited Kitt and Roman Carver Kit üò≠üíóAgain, Kitt was so emotionally mature for a 19 year old. His upbringing might have looked better than Iris\'s on the outside but he was battling an internal war with himself over the grief of his sister\'s death and his father\'s suffocating expectations of him. I loved that he fell first and his initial actions just reiterated how much she meant to him - that her words were hisinvisible stringholding him together. I loved watching his facade slowly crumble around him throughout this book, it was written so well.He followed her to war üò≠ and the best part? He didn\'t go to convince her to go home or to sideline her. He just went to be with her because he couldn\'t stand to be away from her.

I\'m already missing these characters so much.The following review will contain major spoilers fromHouse of Flame and Shadowso if you haven\'t finished reading I advise you not to read this review until then.Also, Sarah recently confirmed Crescent City book 4 is happening (probably in a few years). This one is a conclusion for Bryce\'s story.[MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW]...................................This book was one hell of an emotional ride and it might come as a surprise that I haven\'t rated it 5-star, but the more I thought about the book the more issues I found in it so I decided to deduct it from my 4-star rating to 3.5-star which is how I feel.I got some theories right which I\'m very excited about, I also got some theories wrong which was expected because I knew Sarah would throw a curveball at me in this book. It\'s fun to explore the possibilities as a reader but also I love it when the author surprises me and Sarah did, especially in part 1!!!Let\'s begin with the ACOTAR segment:Keep in mind that SJM changed the timeline gap she originally intended between ACOSF and HOFAS (which was around 6-9 months in her first draft)The gap between ACOSF\'s ending and HOFAS events isapproximately 3 months(Nesta said she killed Lanthys 7 months ago, which happened a month before Winter Solstice in ACOSF). So it\'s June/beginning of Summer in the ACOTAR world.The Middengard Worm making a cameo was not on my bingo card.- Nesta deserves a 5‚≠êÔ∏è for being the badass that she was in all the scenes. I loved seeing her in action and to see glimpses of the warm person behind an ice cold mask she mastered wearing. We see more of her sentimental side when Bryce plays music (in the bonus chapter) and when Nesta bids Ember and co. farewell. Nesta is set up to be an important player in ACOTAR5 now that she was left with Gwydion/Starsword and to find out why she got the eight-pointed star tattoo.- Azriel, my beloved, also deserves a 5‚≠êÔ∏è. Seeing the spymaster and the Shadowsinger in action alongside Nesta was fun but also the crumbs SJM littered in the ACOTAR segment for him makes me even more thrilled for his arc in ACOTAR5, now that is a protagonist that is being well-prepped for his own book. We touch upon his mother and fondness of music in the bonus chapter, we still don\'t know how he got Truth-teller and the fact that his precious knife was originally owned by Enalius (the first of the Illyrians) and that is another tie to Illyria, we don\'t know how his shadows and magic work, he finds out through the Asteri under the Prison that the Illyrians were made by them, and honestly SJM gave more than what I expected when it comes to him. His personality is even more fleshed out and to my delight many of my friends and readers are warming up to him (he always had a personality you just needed to look closer).""[...] that wasn\'t there as Azriel landed fromabove them. His wings were spread so wide they nearly touched either side of the cavern.""Thank you Janet for confirming who has the largest wingspan yet again.- Now, Nesta and Azriel as a duo are incredible!!! I love their bond and friendship and seeing how much they look out and care about each other. They understand one another and that has been obvious to us since ACOSF, they both master putting on an icy mask to hide their emotions.Rhysand alongside Amren made a brief appearance at the beginning of the book and he seems apprehensive about the Asteri and the fact that anyone can walk into their world (I think we will see implications of that in ACOTAR5 being that Rhys saw two alien females fall into his world only months apart). He\'ll grapple with the question of who else can enter their world and how do they put a stop to it.I loved the ACOTAR segment so much because it was lore galore and I was craving all that info dump since ACOSF.The whole history of High King Fionn, Queen Theia, and Pelias was darker than I expected and I\'m glad Fionn did not turn out to be evil. I still feel enraged and devastated with what happened with Helena and Silene (Theia\'s daughters). It\'s almost impossible to excuse their actions but it is still sad that Theia damned her own family and people because she thirsty for more power.I can\'t wait to see what more will be revealed in ACOTAR5!The ACOTAR-related bonus chapters include: Walmart edition (Bryce, Nesta, Azriel) + BAM/Indigo (Ember and Randall).My current theory is some of the events in ACOTAR5 will happen in parallel with HOFAS (at least the first 30% of the book).To conclude this part, I\'m glad the crossover did not take over a big chunk of the book because it IS a Crescent City book.I wasn\'t rooting for a major crossover either with Throne of Glass (as much as it pains me to say it because I miss them), it would\'ve tangled up all 3 series and we would end up with a messy storyline. Major crossovers work for movies, not for books.The crossover was important for ACOTAR and CC because they are tied by history and we got answers that are important for both. We got resolution for it in this book, but not yet for ACOTAR. I didn\'t clarify earlier, we did get some TOG crumbs but it doesn\'t have the same level of implications as ACOTAR and it does leave the door open for a future crossover, but as of now we know most of TOG storylines had their resolution but Sarah did leave the door open for more stories.Now... moving on toCrescent CityI was rooting for Bryce but I did find her reckless and insufferable in many moments. It makes me miss HOEAB Bryce but in this book she\'s coming off too much self-absorbed.It\'s hard for me to buy the suprise schemes Bryce pre-planned, I mean it works for a character like Aelin but not Bryce. Certain scenes are convincing and some came out of the blue or were too convenient.Hunt is my darling and it was obvious throughout the book he is hesitant and triggered by his trauma since Shahar\'s rebellion so he will question every step they take, and Bryce seems pretty dismissive to him during those moments which... is not doing her any favors. She\'s not helping him through it and it makes my heart break even more for Hunt because he is so wary of upsetting her about it. Like, Bryce darling... he went through very gruesome torture sessions recently so cut him so slack.Don\'t get me wrong, I LOVE Quinlar and I\'m always rooting for them but... I hoped we would be past their trust issues and disagreements over minor things. I still want them to argue and fight, I don\'t want them to be a perfect couple but all this still rubbed me the wrong way.I also expected a soul-shattering, emotional reunion after the whole ""our love spans across time and universes"" quote but I felt underwhelmed with what I got given one of them was in another universe and the other was being tortured.Still, I got many other moments that I loved and cried and gushed over. Especially their bonus chapter!On the other hand, I devoured all of Ruhn and Lidia\'s chapters. Lidia\'s chapters especially are just *chef\'s kiss*.This book made me fall in love with them more and I was eating up all the angst, all the longing, and the intense sexual tension between them.I wish they got their own book though I need more of them.There were a few surprises about Lidia that I did not expect but I also love that for her and it helped to better understand her motivations.The chapters I struggled with the most are Ithan\'s and Tharion\'s. I\'m sorry but they were a snoozefest except for a few scenes.I\'m happy with what Ithan became and the resolution he got towards the end of the book, but the whole Fendyr/Reaper storyline wasn\'t all that interesting. At least I got more of Jesiba who also has her own very interesting backstory.Also, totally rooting for him and Perry.Tharion\'s chapters didn\'t get interesting to me until Sathia came into the picture. It\'s painful to see him make one miserable decision after another. It\'s like Sarah testing how much can one character fuck up.Sathia was a delightful surprise, I didn\'t expect Flynn\'s sister who made her seem to be nothing but trouble come off as a compelling character. I hope we get her POV in CC4. I want to explore a Fae female\'s POV who lived among the Fae and how their views and treatment of females turned her into who she is and how she can move on from it.I\'m a big fan of marriage of convenience trope so I\'ll consume all of it (if SJM manages to make Tharion more likable).Flynn (and his sprites), Declan, Baxian played important roles and I still adore them. I just can\'t help but think of how Baxian will live on without his mate Danika, it hurts.I was totally bamboozled by who Hunt\'s father is, let\'s just say he was conceived through team effort. He has three dads.Moving on to the villains:I\'ll start with the character that had the most satisfying death and it\'s Pollux. Lidia the female that you are. It was perfection.I didn\'t like how the Autumn King and King Morven of Avallen were off\'ed. It felt too convenient and I wanted a more satisfying resolution between Bryce/Ruhn and the Autumn King. He can get killed all over again for all I care, I just hoped it would be under a different scenario.Good riddance Sabine is dead.I expected something more in the final confrontation with the Asteri but it wasn\'t as epic as I expected it to be. I mean I\'m glad they\'re gone but I don\'t know... it was too easy. I don\'t think it even took 50 pages to off them.I felt like every villain was eliminated way too easily and way too conveniently. I think it would\'ve been better to spread out their deaths between HOSAB and HOFAS.I\'m glad that we saw Aidas, Apollion, and Thanatos but I was hoping for an epic battle between them and the Asteri. That one was too quick.There is one trope Sarah likes to pull in the climax but I\'m getting bored of it because she did it too many times to the point it no longer is impactful as it intends to be.Another thing that threw me off was shift between different character POVs mid chapter which felt like a whiplash and needed better formatting. To me I don\'t think Sarah is weak when it comes to writing multiple POVs (look at Throne of Glass), but for some reason it didn\'t have a smooth flow in this book.Overall, I did enjoy parts of book but Sarah took a big risk with the crossover.Though will say I\'m left with questions like:‚Ä¢ What happened to the comms Crystal Ruhn gave Bryce before she escaped to Prythian?‚Ä¢ What about all the Thurr connections and comparisons to Hunt?‚Ä¢ What\'s the point of Ariadne and her dragon flame being able to burn even Princes of Hel?‚Ä¢ Did we just forget about Viktoria?‚Ä¢ Octartis (the Asteri) was a female in HOSAB, but in HOFAS it\'s a male?There are obvious continuity errors, typos and inconsistencies this book suffered from.Don\'t let my review impact your experience with this book or your rating, I love these characters and this world and I will miss them dearly but I always planned to keep my review transparent when it comes to this book. Sarah is one of my all-time favorite authors and half of her books are 5-stars to me so you\'ll know it will take a lot to sway me from that rating.I will definitely revisit these books in the future, I have attachment issues with Sarah\'s books.I will end this review with my favorite quote in HOFAS that made me sob even harder the moment I read it because of what it meant to these characters and to me.The friends they‚Äôd made were what mattered in the end. Not the enemies.Through love, all is possible.Thank you Sarah for another emotional journey I\'m forever grateful for the stories and the characters you always gift us ‚ù§Ô∏è'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3‚≠êÔ∏è Definitely had its moments but it wasn‚Äôt my favorite.***This review containsSPOILERSso if you have not read HOFAS or the previous books in the series, STOP SCROLLING ***PS: If you want to read the bonus chapters, I have them ALL on my story highlights on Instagram @thebiglittlelibrary ü´∂ My favorites are Target\'s & BAM\'s!...Here\'s a fun, little summary of what happens:‚ú® ACOTAR crossover‚ú® Bryce eats a magic bean‚ú® Middengard Worm cameo‚ú® History lesson with a ghost‚ú® Nesta slayyyyyys‚ú® Tharion is an idiot‚ú® Baxian gets hungry in the dungeons‚ú® Ithan packs one hell of a punch‚ú® Lidia Cervos serves cunt‚ú® Boring Quinlar reunion‚ú® ""We All Live In A Yellow Submarine"" üé∂‚ú® Lidia\'s is legit Mother‚ú® Lots of sad boi energy‚ú® Hunt has a wardrobe malfunction üçÜ‚ú® Asteri just being their usual asshole selves‚ú® Hypaxia is . . . there‚ú® ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Fear The Reaper‚Äù üé∂‚ú® A random arranged marriage‚ú® Hel is DTF with an alliance‚ú® Hunt learns he was a test tube baby‚ú® Parricide üëè‚ú® Avallen gets a makeover‚ú® Bryce becomes death‚ú® Ithan nuts up‚ú® Hypaxia cures COVID‚ú® Epic final battle‚ú® Hel + sprites to the rescue‚ú®AelinLidia serves even more cunt‚ú® Pollux gets fucked‚ú® ""Super Massive Black Hole"" üé∂‚ú® Bryce takes a trip to space‚ú® Hunt becomes Iron Man‚ú® Jesiba pulls a Ben Solo‚ú® Happily Ever After‚ú® My Little Pony reboot‚ú® House of Many Waters COMING SOON featuring Tharion (and Ithan)My Thoughts:Was it a bad story? No. But was it the best? No. There were things I liked and didn\'t like. I\'ll be going over all of it. So buckle the fuck up because this is going to be one hell of a review.First, I want to address the ACOTAR crossover.Honestly, I\'m indifferent about it all. I was surprised we mostly see Bryce interacting with just Nesta and Azriel, but I wasn\'t mad about it. I actually liked Bryce and Nesta\'s interactions and could DEFINITELY see them as friends under different circumstances. But honestly, Nesta was the best part of this entire crossover. Even after ACOSF I wasn‚Äôt a huge Nesta fan but after this, I really like her. I enjoyed seeing her from a total stranger\'s perspective!The entire point of the crossover was learning about Theia and her connection to the ACOTAR world - and it did its job there. HOWEVER, knowing that Hel knew the same history and could have easily shared this with Bryce is where my problem with the crossover comes in. If Hel had stepped in to give Bryce all the information (which Aidas says he didn\'t do because \'Bryce wasn\'t ready\'), there would be no need for a crossover. I mean, I guess at some point she‚Äôd have to visit the Fae world to absorb Silene‚Äôs Starborn power, but I believe it could have been done without even seeing any of the ACOTAR characters. Which pretty much makes me believe SJM did this as a fan service and/or as a way to get fans who haven\'t read CC, to read it. It was a genius marketing strategy, but I don\'t think it did much for the story. And unfortunately, I‚Äôm hearing from quite a few people that the crossover disappointed them. So, in the end, it may have backfired on SJM. But if you enjoyed the crossover, I\'d like to know and hear your thoughts on why. üòäWhat I liked:The overall plot.Listen, I gotta give it to SJM, she sure knows how to weave a story together. It\'s wild to me that even the smallest of details tend to have some significance later on in the story - things you may not have even realized are of any importance at all. I enjoyed the journey we\'ve been on since book one, and I thought how everything came together by the end was phenomenal.The insanity and possibilities of the Maasverse.I am still reeling from all the connections Midgard has to the worlds of ACOTAR and TOG. We mostly focus on the connections to the ACOTAR realm (the Fae home world) but we get some bits and pieces of the ties to the TOG realm thanks to the stories from Aidas and Jesiba. I am honestly in awe of how Sarah J. Maas is able to keep all this information straight and continue to build upon it. This is what I really admire and respect about the Crescent City series. From a fantasy standpoint, I think it was incredibly well done. This is a complex world with a complex history and magic system that can definitely be understood by a first time reader, but is probably appreciated more by those who\'ve read her other series. I\'m excited to see what Sarah does next in terms of connecting these worlds in the future.History lessons with Theia\'s daughter, Silene.This was so freaking cool. I absolutely LOVED learning more about our beloved ACOTAR world as well as the beginnings of Midgard and the role the Asteri played in all of it. It was a lot darker than I expected, which made it that much more interesting. The only thing I predicted beforehand was that the Prison was the Dusk Court, but besides that everything else was new information and super fun to learn about!Lidia mother-fucking Cervos.She is a baddie. Period. End of story. The things she\'s done. . . the things she\'s put herself through for years all for the sake of her sons. . . I\'m in awe. Lidia is the definition of strength. Her backstory was so heartbreaking. I legitimately cried. The way she sacrifices her entire being (mind, body, and soul) really reminded me of the way Rhys sacrificed himself while under the mountain. Both these characters put on a mask and became monsters in order to protect the ones they love. Even how they act after they are free and deal with the trauma is very similar. There\'s a lot of parallels between the two, which is why I probably love them both so much. Honestly, Lidia is my favorite character of the entire series and I wish we\'d gotten more time with her. Also, the fact she‚Äôs a descendent of King Brannon from the TOG world and therefore related to Aelin and Dorian in some way was not a surprise but super cool nevertheless.Lidia and Ruhn\'s romance.These two have my whole heart. ü´∂ I absolutely ADORE them! They\'re probably my second favorite mated couple besides Feysand. They went through absolute hell in this book. Ruhn getting tortured and Lidia having to participate was so hard to stomach. Lidia saving Ruhn\'s life and nearly dying only for him to say‚ÄúYou‚Äôre dead to me,‚Äùmade me want to scream. And finding out Lidia has children and her real motives for being the Hind absolutely broke my heart. üò≠ They endure so much in such a short amount of time, and even though there was so much broken trust between them, they\'re able to accept the past and be there for one another. Lidia and Ruhn deserved their HEA. And if you haven\'t yet, RUN to the link in my bio at @thebiglittlelibrary and read their bonus chapter because it is so perfect!Ithan\'s character arc and story development.Did his rise to power feel a bit random and rushed? Yes. But I didn\'t expect it, so I liked that his story wasn\'t predictable - especially when he kills Sigrid by punching her through the throat. I GASPED so hard. lol Ithan was actually someone who really annoyed me in book two - he was immature and seemed lost - but his guilt for killing Sigrid takes him on a journey that ends with him coming into his own and finding his purpose as Prime. He grew up a lot and I honestly wouldn\'t be mad about seeing more of his story in future CC books. I\'m also excited by the fact he has the elemental power of snow! Just another connection to the TOG world.What I didn\'t like:The multiple, mid-chapter POV changes DROVE ME NUTS.This was probably my biggest issue. Most of the chapters had three different POVs. And at the beginning of the book, there were four main plots happening at the same time: Bryce in the Fae home world; Hunt, Ruhn, and Baxian being tortured, Tharion with the Viper Queen, and Ithan and the other random side characters trying to figure out wtf to do. So each chapter, we\'d follow one character and just as things were starting to ramp up, we\'d shift to another character in a completely different situation. Because of these constantly changing POV, the story didn\'t flow well and I wasn\'t able to truly immerse myself. I felt removed while reading. Maybe if each chapter had only focused on one, maybe two (max) POVs, the story might not have felt so disjointed.The predictable ending.While I enjoyed the Asteri plot, I thought the ending was predictable and incredibly low stakes (since you know no one important is going to actually die and stay dead). This could be because I\'ve read SJM\'s other series and have noticed some patterns and similarities to how she writes her endings. The allying with the \'dark\' forces of Hel, the sprites showing up last minute, the Lidia and Pollux confrontation, and Bryce dying and coming back to life, felt similar to the end of ACOWAR. And while the ending had a different plot, the familiarity of it all didn\'t allow for me to feel any surprise. It definitely wasn\'t a bad ending . . . I just didn\'t really pull me in.The story is plot heavy with not enough character / relationship growth.There was too much going on plot-wise with too many different storylines and too many POVs. While everything neatly came together in the end, the journey to get there was messy and overly complex. I think SJM could have found a way to simplify the plot and cut some POVs to make this easier to digest. But at the same time, because there was so much focus on the plot, a few of the characters and relationships didn\'t get the attention they deserved. Specifically, Hunt and Ruhn dealing with the trauma from their torture, Lidia dealing with her trauma, Ruhn and Lidia\'s relationship (see below), Ithan\'s and his character arc, and Tharion as a whole because what growth has he even gone through throughout this entire series?Not only did Ruhn and Lidia not get enough screen time to truly work through their trauma, trust issues, and anger, but THEY WERE ROBBED of a beautiful romance journey.(Sort of how we were robbed of more Elorcan in TOG.) I totally get the need for more plot in this book because it\'s the ending to the series and things need to wrap up. However, we barely scratched the surface of Ruhn and Lidia\'s romance in HOSAB. And then in this book, things are bad for a while before they come together without spending adequate time resolving any issues, healing from their traumas, and growing as a couple. I understand that it wasn\'t possible to do this in an already 838 page book, but I truly believe other things should have been cut to make their story more impactful. Or, I think they shouldn\'t have been a couple at the end so we\'d get a book that focuses on Ruhn and Lidia. Regardless, I think not diving deep into their story was a missed opportunity.Hunt and Bryce\'s \'reunion\'.This was one of the most anticlimactic scenes in the entire book. I was expecting Hunt and Bryce to immediately jump into each other\'s arms . . . to sob . . . to kiss . . . and say some incredibly romantic and sappy shit to one another. BUT NONE OF THAT HAPPENS. After everything they went through to find each other again, this was not the reunion I was hoping for.Hunt and Bryce as a coupleListen, I don\'t want to get into it but I don\'t think they have chemistry. Compared to SJM\'s other couples, they\'re definitely one of the weaker pairings. I get that in the story, they supposedly have this insane connection that spans across time and space, but I just never felt it. Side note: I LEGIT forgot they were married. üòÇIf you like Bryce and Hunt (and the rest of the Crescent City characters), I believe you\'ll really enjoy this story. But if you\'ve struggled to like or even connect with most of them, this story will probably disappoint you.Unfortunately, I fall in the latter group. As a whole, I think the CC characters are a bunch of immature idiots who act more like the stereotypical frat guys and sorority girls than people capable of saving the world. I mean, the majority of the characters are in their 20s but even the ones who are older still act childish at times.Bryce.I\'m sorry, but she\'s my least favorite SJM FMC. She\'s a selfish, immature, pick-me girl. If I had to read another sentence about how hot she was according to EVERY SINGLE GUY besides her brother, and listen to more of her shitty jokes (which EVERY SINGLE GUY thinks is so fucking funny), I was going to scream. And I get Bryce is a sarcastic bitch to everyone, but there\'s a time and a place for everything, and being obnoxious doesn\'t ever actually get anyone anywhere.Bryce also isn\'t a character that earned my respect as The Chosen One. Let\'s look at the origins of SJM\'s other main FMCs. Feyra was a hunter and Aelin was an assassin, while Bryce was . . . a party girl? The other FMCs proved themselves to be worthy of being the Chosen One but Bryce had zero skills to qualify her as a fighter or good leader yet somehow she was able to amass a group of people to follow her. Also, she never learned new skills. She solely relied on her inherited powers and the skills of others. Nepotism at its finest.Bryce was incredibly selfish when she unleashed an Asteri onto the Fae home world without a second thought for the millions of lives there . . . all because she wants answers, which she doesn‚Äôt really even get! Thank the Cauldron Nesta was there to save the day! And then, when Bryce tells Hunt, her supposed soulmate, to sack up and get over his trauma. Girl, WHAT?!Lastly, Bryce hating ALL fae because she‚Äôs had some bad experiences with a few seems incredibly close minded and just plain stupid. What about the fae in her life like Ruhn, Declan, Flynn and countless others who are kind and fight for what‚Äôs right? Apparently they don‚Äôt count. But how dumb is she to write off an entire race/species based on the actions of a few?Tharion.I didn\'t care for him in book one. I disliked him in book two. And I absolutely hate him in book three. I mean, does ANYONE like Tharion? Please, if you do, let me know in the comments and tell me why because I must be missing something. From what we\'ve seen, he is a selfish, immature, fuck boi that doesn\'t go through any character growth throughout this ENTIRE series. I was extremely annoyed that his POV took up a huge chunk of this book when it added little to this story. But it looks like SJM was mainly setting things up for him (and Ithan) to be the MCs in her next CC book. üôÑ I know I\'ll read it because it\'s SJM, but I won\'t be happy about it. He better undergo a serious transformation, like Nesta in ACOSF, or else that\'ll be the end of my CC journey.So many side characters that don\'t matter.Declan and Flynn.Okay, Declan\'s THE tech guy who only has use whenever SJM needed someone to hack something. How convenient. üôÑ But Flynn . . . I CANNOT for the life of me remember anything useful he did.Baxian.He\'s Danika\'s mate. Cool. And? I guess he\'s a hunk of meat that Bryce can call on during a fight. But as a character, he\'s not THAT special.Sigrid.She had so much potential but only propelled Ithan\'s character arc forward. Super pointless but probably setting up for the next book.Sathia.The most random of all characters. She pops up out of nowhere (I genuinely forgot Flynn had a sister) and married Tharion? This has to be a setup for the next book, but it just added another unnecessary piece to an already overly complicated story.Fury and Juniper.Bryce\'s ONLY female friends and I forgot about them lol. The fact Fury doesn\'t play an active role in this series is another missed opportunity. What\'s the point in Bryce having a badass friend if she doesn\'t even help??? I truly believe Sarah could and should have cut out a few of these people to simplify the story.Aidas\' reason for not just telling Bryce the entire truth about everything was flimsy.Apparently, it\'s because ""Bryce wasn\'t ready"". He couldn\'t risk her telling the wrong person and the Asteri finding out. So instead, he\'d rather have Bryce go on an insane goose chase and risk her life doing a bunch of other dangerous shit because he didn\'t think he could tell her the truth and convince her to keep her mouth shut. This entire situation just brought up my PTSD from when Danika withheld the truth from Bryce. Riddle me this, how is it that someone who no one seems to trust ends up with the most power and becomes the savior of Midgard??I also found it strange that Hel, a realm that has been trying to eradicate the Asteri for 15,000 years from Midgard and is currently helping other realms fight these beings, are fine sitting back, letting millions, if not, billions die throughout the years. From what I remember, after the initial rebellion with Theia, they tried helping once by creating the Thunderbirds. But that was eons ago and I don\'t believe they really tried since. It\'s like they were fine waiting till one of Theia\'s heirs was ready to take on the mantle and become the catalyst for a successful rebellion. But again, once they found Bryce, they didn\'t do shit to help her understand her powers or the history of Midgard and the Asteri. Ugh. Why??? There just isn\'t a good enough reason. So overall, I think Hel not stepping in more didn\'t make sense for a realm that is \'eager\' to help the universe, but also Aidas not revealing the whole truth earlier was such a cop-out and made Hel\'s entire involvement useless until it was convenient for the story.Overall, House of Flame and Shadow was an okay conclusion to the Crescent City series. I enjoyed how everything came full circle and how SJM scratches the surface of the multiverse. Sarah J. Maas is still one of my favorite authors, and even though this may not have been my favorite book, I respect the hell out of her and admire her. She\'s created some of the most magical worlds and stories that have changed a generation of readers, so she\'ll always hold a special place in my heart. I am excited for the next ACOTAR book, but I do hope she does what she does best and gives us a story with the perfect combination of a compelling plot, character growth, and romance. And for the love of god please don‚Äôt let it have more than 2 POVs.Favorite Quotes:‚ÄúYou‚Äôre as much of a monster as they are.‚Äù‚ÄúLove will do that to you.‚Äù_______For Bryce, home was - and always would be - Hunt._______‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a prince, start acting like one.‚Äù_______‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fucking care who you are, so long as you‚Äôre mine.

The plan is to come back on Monday and edit these into something easier to read lol. Don\'t expect these to be in an order that makes sense.

Not to mention that this series was supposed to be about female friendships. We just, do away with fury and juniper altogether in this book. Stupid. Also, Fury literally makes a scoff about how all she‚Äôs doing is playing babysitter and I was like UH YEAH. THE FUCK?JesibaThere should have been breadcrumbs. We should have seen her interact with SOMEONE who knows Appolion *ahem, Aidas* and had her trash talk him. Then we‚Äôd be like what‚Äôs her beef?Book of breathings/library of parthosbig old plot hole. Disappointing.reunion between Bryce and Huntone of the things that made me SO ANGRYYYYYY like in the moment I was walking around saying ‚Äúthe fuck???

You cannot tell me they shouldn‚Äôt have been sobbing together. bullshit.Lack of character dev.I was surprised by this. I expected the book to at least take place over the course of a month, not like, a week. I get we don‚Äôt tend to change as humans thaaaaat much over a week but it\'s historically been something I appreciate that in her writing and we got none of it.Silene / Princes of Hel info dumpsI could go on and on here, but in essence, it‚Äôs bloody infuriating that there were people who knew everything all along and never guided or drop-fed that info to us over the three books. ‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt ready‚Äù I WANTED TO THROW MY PHONE what a cop-out. Secondly, by sharing all this info all at once, the reader doesn‚Äôt get to chew on any of it, the think about what it means. We‚Äôre just hanging on for dear life trying to take it all in. It‚Äôs like someone tossing us a ball‚Ä¶ versus having a cannon full of tennis balls shot at you all at onceGeneral messiness/she bit off more than she could chewWhen I‚Äôm over here wishing that she‚Äôd kill some characters off, just so that we could have some emotional impact AND narrow the field, we‚Äôve got a big problem. I think about Chekov‚Äôs Gun all the time when I‚Äôm reading‚Ä¶ the rule in writing that if you include an element, you should use it by the book‚Äôs conclusion. And she just‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve never been more convinced than I am now after HoFaS that SJM doesn‚Äôt actually have some crisp master plan. She just leaves a fuck-tonne of Chekov‚Äôs Guns lying around, and picks them up willy nilly when it sort of works in a future book. That‚Äôs why it feels so messy, plot-hole-y, and just kind of ???the (anti)climaxthe whole final fight scene was anticlimactic, it never felt like anyone was actually in danger, and legit in all caps I was fuuuuuuming about the bringing her back to life. Nah. I‚Äôm fucking sick of it. Death is there for a reason. Get rid of it and you have NO stakes.

I was thoroughly entertained, invested and satisfied with the way this book was written. I would say that when you go into this book,please keep in mind you're reading Bryce's story, simply put you are going in for Captain Marvel and not Avengers Endgame ü§∑\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏èI also see people disappointed with the way Bryce was in this book.Even though she had few moments where I felt frustrated with her, I fully understood her. In a strange environment, she is not going to or supposed to act calm. She will be paranoid. Meeting new people whom SHE doesn't know and acting suspicious, trying to escape makes ABSOLUTE sense. Even in her irrational actions, there were rational intentions üëÄComing back to the book which is divided into Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3 like any other Crescent City book.Part 1explored more folklore, history, new places and people (for Bryce) and setting up a much more powerful world building. I found myself loving it, there were some big reveals and connections. I was also shocked to see one of the creatures back in the world and it brought intense memories. It also ends on a brutal note. Iykyk.Part 2was more hands on action, it built on to the reveals made in part 1 brilliantly. I see MANY people saying that this part bored them and dragged on. On the contrary, I found it to be much more intense and mind blowing. Lidia and Ruhn carried it beautifully. Part 2 ends on a very nerve wrecking note, and you'll immediately want to binge the rest of the book.Part 3was simply put- Binge worthy. Big reveals happen here, characters in this world get what they deserve and I ate it up. Ithan and Bryce were my favorite here, and surprisingly Jesiba too. It ends on a satisfying note and I just can't wait to see how it's going to add up to the future books.Onto the characters-‚ù§Ô∏è\u200düî•Bryce-Although a bit erratic her actions are completely justified imo. She is the same Bryce we have grown to love- smartass, funny, badass, always standing up for the right and calculating. The sacrifices she's willing to make was emotional to see. But like any other, she does have flaws and is imperfect.‚ö°Hunt-My man. The way he cared for Bryce was everything. Even while getting tortured to the point where he is close to death, all he cared about was Bryce and his friends. He would do anything to protect them, even if it means he's gonna end up hurt. His big reveal was one that I was never expecting and I was shook. I loved seeing him unleash and put Celestina in her place.üî•Lidia-I LOVE her. She did so much for literally everyone good in this book, such huge sacrifices. She did not put herself first once and I loved her. I swear I just want to give her the biggest hug.üñ§Ruhn-Loved seeing the way he felt for Lidia. Man's had me gasping, crying, emotional for more. His bond with Hunt and Baxian was intense and so loyal. The way he was protecting Bryce was everything. Tho that one scene made me dizzy (you know which one).üê∫Ithan and üßú\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏èTharion-Although different paths, I found them to be quite similar with the way they deal with their struggles. Before anyone gets frustrated with these two- Have you ever made a mistake and in order to correct it desperately, you make more bad decisions and more mistakes?? That sounds pretty relatable to me. Not all of us are perfect. Living in self loathing, guilt, and anxiety isn't easy. Tharion and Ithan thinking that they don't deserve anything good happening to them after making so many mistakes is real and it's amental health representation at its best.So many people acting like Tharion and Ithan were annoying breaks my heart cause I found them to be so endearing and loving, so loyal, so worthy despite what the two thought. I just wish to hold them and talk to them about it all.Baxian-All I'll say is he has strong teeth üò≠Jesiba and Hypaxia-I appreciated so much what these two did, especially Jesiba. Without giving too much away, am sure you'll like them more.The romances-Bryce and Hunt-Honestly, after Feyre and Rhys these two are my favorite SJM couple and they are immensely underrated. Even in their arguments, they know when to support each other. They're the couple who will support each other in public even if they are wrong and correct the other in private.Ruhn and Lidia-So angsty. It's like they broke my heart multiple times and mended it to complete perfection. Literally everything about them is PERFECT. I loved how they communicated and bared themselves to each other.Also, did SJM throw in the marriage of convenience trope? üëÄY'all gotta find out for which couple, no spoilers here. ü§≠ü§≠I believe people have forgotten that this is Bryce's story. In order to enjoy this book, you gotta keep that in mind. I can already see that SJM has foreshadowed a lot of multiversal possible scenarios. Hopefully she'll explore them on an Endgame level someday.But for now, am excited to see where the Crescent City series will go from here üòâ I highly recommend reading this series after ToG and ESPECIALLY ACOTAR.I did not want this to end, I could still read another 500 pages of this beautiful book and world. Already can't wait to reread üò≠‚ù§‚Ä¢~‚Ä¢~IT'S FINALLY HERE üòçüòç In all it's glory ü•πü•π~‚Ä¢~‚Ä¢~Am so ready for Jan 2024""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'The weakest conclusion to an SJM series by far. This book was one big deus ex machina clusterfuck. But I think most fans will overlook the huge issues in this book because we get to see some old favourite characters.Let\'s start off with the good parts:- Lidia Cervos üßéüèª\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏èüßéüèª\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏èüßéüèª\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏èFew characters had any agency in this book. Lidia was one of the few people who actually made a difference in this book. She really stole the show from Bryce and Hunt.- In the same vein as Lidia, Nesta lit up every scene she was in. Every scene she was in, I only noticed her. She really carried every part of the story she touched and she is so fun.- And obviously the entire Prythian part because those characters are elite. Loved the lore drop we got.- There was a particular scene with a few characters waving at each other that broke my heart.Now on to the bad:- Welcome to the Bryce Quinlan Show, where I spent 50% of the book asking myself ""Why are Tharion/Flynn/Declan/Sathia/Hunt/Ruhn even in this scene??"". So much of this book involved Bryce and Co. going somewhere to do something. But they all could have been Bryce\'s solo missions because it literally would not have made a difference if her companions weren\'t there. I think this was made particularly evident because there were 3 or 4 times where Bryce had to relay stuff she had done in the previous chapters to her group of friends. Because her friends weren\'t doing anything. The side characters felt soooo unnecessary in so many points in this book.- Another note on Bryce, she has some smart moments in the book but so much of her dominance is because she is The Chosen One. Everything she gains is because she is related to XYZ and has ABC in her blood. It makes it really hard to root for her because she didn\'t have to earn anything.- As I already mentioned in HOSAB, Bryce is only interesting in the context of Danika. By herself, she isn\'t that particularly interesting or someone I would root for. I think the strongest part about her was her friendship to Danika. This is particularly evident when anything happens between Hunt and Bryce. They just don\'t have that much chemistry tbh. I really wish this series had been about Bryce and Danika. Hunt really felt like a side piece. I really dgaf about this man.- I can\'t believe I had to read about Hunt going commando because his d**k is too big to fit into his underwear. I actually wanted to gouge my eyes out. ü§¢üòµ\u200düí´üòµ Also Hunt and Bryce getting handsy while their friends were fighting for their lives? Why were Ruhn and Lidia trying to get it on while their friends were literally right beside them in the cave? The most unnecessary scenes that were added just so this book can be spicy.- Ithan LOLOLOL. If you look up ""filler character"" he would be the #1 offender. He actually didn\'t do anything in this book for the first 70% and then he suddenly just have everything happen to him. His rise in power was the most eye-rolling experience because he doesn\'t deserve any of this.- Tharion sorry babes I wish I had skipped every scene you were in. I actually do not give a fck about this man. Suddenly Sathia appears. What did she even add to the story? Tharion and Ithan were the two most ridiculous characters in this book. I\'m actually so mad both of them got so much ""screen time"". But Tharion might get the ""Nesta"" treatment because it is clear his story isn\'t over.- In true SJM fashion, we get the ""We could have told you all of this in Book 1 but you weren\'t ready so we are just going to explain everything now"". I\'m so sick and tired of important information being gatekept for the sake of having a plot.- I want SO MUCH MORE grovelling between Ruhn and Lidia. I wanted the angst and yearning and the hurt x comfort. They are by far the best couple in this series.- LOOOL COOPER. Why did we focus so much on Sophie and Emilie in book 2 for them to basically not matter at all.- Sigrid and Ariadne felt like loose ends. Perhaps they will be important in future books but they took up too much time in this book for them to not matter much at the end.- OK, so book 1 had that big dramatic massacre, which really got my hopes up that SJM would actually commit to some gruesome ends for some of her main characters. SYKE! I\'m so tired of none of the characters actually being in danger.- Hypaxia exists to be a deus ex machina. Her and Jesiba\'s sole purpose in the series is to get people out of a pickle. They literally didn\'t serve any other purpose.- Also where were Juniper and Fury? They were completely neglected except for one scene.- While writing this, I just remembered I haven\'t even mentioned Baxian. That just shows how insignificant he was in every scene he was in. He just gets lumped in with Hunt and Co.- The Harpy comes back for her to get KO\'d in 0.2 seconds?- Hypaxia defeats a certain character very quickly. It felt so out of left field and rushed.Overall, this book felt sloppy.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'The harder you rise, the harder you fall. Sarah J Maas wrote her own kill switch to the ‚ÄúMaasverse‚Äù and activated it when this was published.Disappointed does not even sum up the entirety of how I‚Äôm feeling. For those people who are really enjoying and loving this, I am so happy for you, and I wish that was the case for me. But I am just glad to have finished it so I never have to think about it again. Long live the Crescent City duology. I am envious of the characters who got to die in HOSAB/HOEAB so they didn‚Äôt have to experience HOFAS and the defamation of character that touched every single character I had previously cared about and rendered them boring, two dimensional and soulless.For a book ‚Äúmillions of fans‚Äù have been waiting for for two years, Sarah did not deliver. She did not even purchase a postage label. The epic conclusion to the crescent city trilogy, which had so much potential, was reduced into a messy concubine of soap opera, unwanted comedy and minimal stakes. There was so much potential. So much potential and this is what we got. I am so angry.The writing in this book leads me to believe Sarah no longer cares about Lunathion, or her characters. This book is a testament to laziness, loss of passion and the arrogance of knowing no matter what she wrote, she would be making money.Through love all is possible‚Ä¶ yet there was no love in this book. It was rendered impossibly cold and distant from anything else she could have possibly written. Through ‚Äúconvenient coincidences‚Äù, all is possible, should be her new slogan.I don‚Äôt even understand how in any stage of production, anyone at bloomsbury could confidently look at this and not question the drastic changes to characters, such as Bryce‚Äôs complete tyrannical selfishness, and Hunt‚Äôs stripped down personality and so on and so on. HOFAS was a failure and nothing more.Due to my disappointment at the entire picture, I could not even bring myself to be excited when certain plot points; which I would have screamed at, were unravelled, they felt anticlimactic and convenient at best. The the potential Sarah carefully constructed in not only the last two books, but the small sprinkles of lore throughout all her books, remains completely untapped and unused. Fans and theorists could have patched together a better ending to this series and (as someone who grew distasteful of theorists and did not look forward to a crossover) I‚Äôve seen theorists who care more and know more and understand more of Sarah‚Äôs precious worlds than she seemingly did in this book.I am so so so angry. Sarah chose convenience, palatable and cheap shock factor over writing something meaningful. I can only guess this comes from the fact that ‚Äúfame‚Äù has gotten to her head. Sarah has done a disservice to long standing fans in an attempt to suck in and appeal to celebrities and influencers, blending epic backstories and well planned out history into grey palatable mush that can be consumed by the masses, instead of the quality book it could have been to be consumed by the people that make this all possible for her.Even her regular fashion of fast paced, ‚Äúepic‚Äù final 100 pages could not overcome first 700 pages of convenience, low stakes nonsense. There was no slice of life, no character development, just a long endless cave of info dumping and convenience.Sarah‚Äôs best writing is a footnote in the past. Bloomsbury I am so so disappointed in you for allowing this, marketing this, profiting off this. House of Flame and Shadow is a mockery of everything good in fantasy and did not deserve our excitement, our hope, or our joy.I normally restrain myself from negative reviews, because I do believe all art is subjective and everyone has a right to enjoy art as it comes. But this was objectively bad and there are no excuses. There is no explanation. Someone as revered as Sarah J Maas should be doing better as she rises, not worse. I hope HOFAS/Sarah and the rightful people at bloomsbury receive the criticism this book deserves so that they can ensure future books do not suffer the same fate.'}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""By now I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôve all seen the news for special editions.

I don't know anyone in real life who has read this book, or who is just as excited about any of this as I am, so I have no one to scream these at. Instead, I'll scream them at you all!- Rhys' last name is Danaan?????- Either that or Ruhn isn't actually the son of Autumn King since he's clearly a descendant from the Night Court (Bryce literally thought Rhys was Ruhn so clearly there's a blood relation, But like the Autumn king is clearly from the Autumn court???? pls give me theories!)- Azriel has major ties to fey in Lunathion since he had Truth Teller and was the one that casually found Bryce. I no longer believe in coincidence. Everything is suspicious. If the whole ACOTAR gang can't cross to Bryce's world, I think only Az might. (The starborn sword and his knife have to fight together.- Fury and Amren are related or have similar powers or are of the same species (they basically act the same and no one knows what Fury can actually do). Are they one of the Asteri's creations??? Like how the Asteri made the angels and mentioned creating prototypes for the angels in the previous world which I assume is what the Illyrians are????? Where Amren and Fury creations of theirs in another world??-Hunt is part Thunderbird (We're told that he was literally bred for something and his father is a mystery) Like clearly one of the princes is his father, but like, the guy can literally absorb and use energy which is pretty thunderbird-ish.- Hunt is going to literally just suck the energy out of the Asteri and that's how he'll kill them. (I kept thinking that's what the thunderbird was going to do and then that went nowhere).-Cormac isn't dead. (I've decided that I like him and so he can't die.)- Cormac's side of the family might be related to Aelin and her world.- The shifters obviously come from Aelin's world and the wolves are lowkey related Fenrys????- I don't think Aelin will make much of an appearance. (the girl is tired, she went through too much let her rest!)- If Aelin does show up, it'll be brief. (As I said, she's tired, she's not here to fight) But if she does, I really just want her, Bryce and Cassian to interact because the chaos and badassery they would bring would be unmatched.- Ruhn and Lidia are obviously mates. Because duh. (Also, I totally called her being Agent Daybright. I knew right from chapter one that Lidia would be a good guy when she threw Sofie into the water.) But anyway, she might have some connection to Aelin???? I just get a vibe from her.Feel free to tell me I'm crazy. At this point, I'm grasping at straws and I know it.""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Erm, it‚Äôs no from me.I‚Äôve said this before and I‚Äôll say it again:Sarah J.

Instead of growing into her power, her knowledge with wisdom, with the support of others that are much more skilled and smarter than she is, that understand the political nuance of the world better than she does, she chose to act like a spoiled, entitled brat, had the nerve to call herself a leader, yet was acting on her own accord all the time.She was running on arrogance and recklessness. She read stupid. She became the ‚Äòalphahole‚Äô she kept complaining about.I don‚Äôt understand why this was the direction her character went in. I don‚Äôt know what SJM or her editors were thinking. Or am I not understanding things correctly?No, I‚Äôm not the problem here.Bryce ruined it.She read like a bootleg version of Aelinand it was embarrassing to read. üôÑAt some point, I had enough of the world-building too. A lot of information was being revealed and it was not smoothly laid out or explored. It just kept being piled on top of one another and I got bored.

I applaud her (yet again) for her ability to weave so many threads, characters and mythology into one insanely action packed tale.SPOILERS BELOW...I'm going to start with Bryce. I adore her. I feel like the theme of this book was ‚ÄòLevel Up‚Äô, and she did this and then some. After all of the shit she went through in the previous books I loved see her step fully into her own.I‚Äôve seen a few reviews criticising her character as being ‚Äòinsufferable‚Äô, which I find kind of interesting ‚Ä¶ mostly for the fact that when we judge something, it‚Äôs most often the thing that we don‚Äôt give ourselves permission to be or feel, or are judging within ourselves. As a collective, women have been taught to fear our own power, and here we‚Äôre presented with a fully fleshed, whole person that doesn‚Äôt feel the need to humble herself or shrink to make herself more relatable to others. Given the above, I get this can be polarising for some people who identify as female‚Ä¶ but for me? I freaking LOVED this. The scene in particular between her and the two fae kings was so cathartic. SJM was really channelling some feminine rage and putting a metaphoric foot down against the patriarchy. Honestly, the amount of times I wish I‚Äôd been in a position to fight back like this‚Ä¶ it was so wonderful to read.Bryce‚Äôs character arc across all three books felt right to me. The bit of tension between her and Hunt also felt valid - I could see things from both their sides and it felt true to their characters. Ultimately, Bryce was carrying the sole weight of being the key to destroying the Asteri, and her mental fortitude (while maybe it came across as being too headstrong at times) was needed in order for her to carry this out. Sorry not sorry.Onto Hunt - bless him, he really went through it in this book. I also thoroughly enjoyed his ‚ÄòLevel Up‚Äô towards the end. The romantic tension between he and Bryce was definitely higher in books 1 & 2 - here they were more in the ‚Äòmarriage phase‚Äô of being a couple, which I guess is fine‚Ä¶ although I wish we‚Äôd had a little bit more of a dramatic reunion / spice. Overall Hunt has always been a solid character in my mind.Lidia & Ruhn‚Ä¶ I LOVE. They carried the romance in this book. Lidia was an incredible personality to work into the mix - she kind of reminds me a bit of Manon in that she‚Äôs not the FMC, but easily could be.Ithan - his scene with Connor had me sobbing. I had secretly hoped he‚Äôd end up as the Prime!Nesta - I‚Äôve never been a massive fan of hers, but I was surprised by how much I enjoyed her in this book!. All of the snark and banter between her and Bryce was fantastic.Azriel - honestly, I‚Äôve never gotten much from Az, and this book was no different. I think people project onto his personality (which is very quiet) and build stories about him in their own minds, because in reality we know very little about him, and he doesn't really speak that often. That being said, I loved the sweet moment between him and Nesta when he convinced her to take off the mask - it did mushy things to my heart.THE ENDINGI have no words except‚Ä¶ what in the holy Interstellar!!? SJM can sure write a mind blowing action scene. So. Freaking. Amazing.THE ACOTAR CROSSOVERFor the most part, I was OK with how this panned out. There was always going to be a fine line between this remaining a Crescent City book vs turning into an ACOTAR take over.I think I would have liked just a **smidge** more from the interactions between Bryce and the gang - particularly with Rhys, Cassian and Feyre (who did not make an appearance at all.) It honestly felt like a Nesta x Crescent City crossover in the end, but I‚Äôm not mad about it. I am glad SJM stuck with the Crescent City POVs and that it stayed firmly a CC book.Furthermore, now that she has opened the connection between the two worlds, it leaves room for CC characters to cameo in future ACOTAR books which I wouldn‚Äôt object to in the slightest. And with the Starsword now back in Velaris‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure it will come into play in future books.Side note: Randall & Ember‚Äôs bonus chapter - IDK why, but she continues to portray Rhys as an overbearing asshole? I just want the Rhys we know and love back.THE NEXT CRESCENT CITY BOOKI‚Äôd guess it will be a continuation of Tharion‚Äôs story. His journey in this book, was, essentially a retelling of The Little Mermaid - it would make sense for the next book given House of Many Waters is the remaining title. I think SJM put Tharion through the ringer in this book to lay the groundwork for a lot of character growth and redemption should his story continue. Maybe he and Ariadne are going to wind up together??Ithan's romance was also hinted at with Perry, but again there's a wide open space there so that's also another possibility.TO SUM UPI'm really sad this series is over, I've loved every second of it. <3""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Part One: The DropRuhn is pretty pissed at his girlfriend and our winged boys (feathers not leathers) aren‚Äôt doing great.

Ithan gets a job as an executive assistant in exchange for reanimating a corpse. Ruhn discovers that Lidia has little fawns and Hunt and Bryce reunite in a really unsatisfying way. You‚Äôve heard of the Avatar, the master of all elements, now meet Hypaxia: The Fendyr-Bender. Bryce and the gang go treasure hunting on the island from MYST. There are many hieroglyphics and Hunt is a huge bitch while in Hel where he meets his dads. Ruhn kills their father (Vanserra boys take note), then Bryce sticks her sword in the floor of a cave and the land heals itself like the end of The Lion King.Part Three: The AscentSyrinx is with Bryce‚Äôs parents so everybody (me) can relax. The Asteri blew up a town square and killed a lot of people so Bryce decides to rip a hole in the space time continuum to get rid of them; perhaps they can be lured by a line of treats on the ground. Nesta just hands over her death Mask, which is totally like her and completely in-character. Bryce makes major decisions regarding other people without consulting them and isn‚Äôt sorry because deez nuts. Hunt decides he‚Äôs tired of his slave halo and just gets rid of it, I guess. Lidia is apparently Aelin‚Äôs granddaughter or something. Bryce sucks all the baddies into a void and then dies and comes back because SJM cannot stop writing anticlimactic endings. Nesta gets a nice hug. What happened to Tharion and his wife and the dragon and the dead alpha and the Viper Queen? What great questions that have no answers.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""1.)House of Earth and Blood‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ2.)House of Sky and Breath‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚ô° all 5 HOFAS bonus chapters:tumblr+redditthis was a reading experience, friends! after my content and trigger warnings, i will do a spoiler section of my thoughts because at this point in the sjm universe / maasverse, and this being the third book in the crescent city series, it is difficult to talk about anything without it being a potential spoiler!i had a good time reading this. I really loved lidia and ruhn‚Äôs storylines and they really made the entire book for me. I am also still so very in love with hypaxia, and the things i would do to get her pov. speaking of, I felt a little bored at some povs in hofas - mostly ithian and tharion (i am so sorry to these men, i love them and feel so much empathy for them, but it is true). and bryce‚Äôs pov made me feel a range of emotions, that‚Äôs for sure, but most of the time it wasn‚Äôt the best emotions. ultimately, i think there were too many povs in this book and sometimes the switching between them felt very jarring and unbalanced. i also feel like there was just so much going on, which valid, but instead of it being information that we started to learn in the first two books, it felt like sjm was kind of just throwing out every plot she could think up. and i think this all made the pacing of this book a bit weird feeling. but i did love that baldur‚Äôs gate unexpected cursed dot storyline a lot.like all sjm books, this could have been edited down a little bit (or a lot a bit). But i think what all sjm‚Äôs books do exceptionally well is discussion of trauma and grief and learning to live coinciding with those two very heavy things and also trying to heal from them, and how those healing paths can look very different for everyone. I feel like we can really see that in her crescent city series and it is always something that i will appreciate her putting out into the world.overall, i had a lot of fun reading this and making connections between all the things. if you follow my reviews, you will know how much i love theorycrafting and connecting different universes together, and this book truly took this experience to a different level. each easter egg truly felt like a long awaited gift i was finally able to open. and once i finished this last page, well‚Ä¶ and all the bonus chapters, the anticipation i felt for whatever sjm does next was very surprising and a little unmatched. plus reading a new sjm book when it drops, with what feels like half of the online book community, feels special each and every new release.trigger + content warnings:death, grief, blood, captivity, slavery, extreme torture, a lot of violence, gun violence, maybe cannibalism / maybe just a lot of gore, battle, war, loss of a loved one in past (and a lot of talk about it), loss of sibling in past, defecation and urine mentions, self harm to get blood, sexual abuse, threat of rape, talk of forced breeding, talk of medical experimentation, talk of domestic abuse, talk of parental abuse, colonization, needles, bombings, a lot of talk and mentions of hurt children, vomit, a lot of talk of parasites, drugging / poisoning, self sacrifice / a lot of attempts at self sacrificingthis next section of this review will be filled with spoilers!please use caution!and please make sure you‚Äôve read the entire throne of glass series and the entire a court of thorns and roses series!us finally getting the throne of glass crossover moment we have all been waiting for? I was truly screaming. lidia cervos, the woman you are. the stag throne, the hidden flame powers, the ruby ring, the blatant descendant name drop of whitethorn galathynius. i am still losing my mind while i type this. obviously bryce and ruhn being somehow related to rhysand is pretty cool. and i truly believe Ithan is a descendant of dorian because of the ice powers (and by the end of tog dorian was a shifter). but lidia being related to aelin? i am just speechless.lidia was the best character in this book for me, too. And she had the most heartfelt and empowering story going on throughout as well. and the naming of her one son brannon? truly, her and ruhn really were the stars of this third book and their povs were hands down my favorite. (that target bonus chapter? so good)okay more throne of glass crossover screaming - the under king! full credit toemmahalbrook on tiktok!but my jaw is still on the floor. i am just so excited to read reviews and find more crossovers that i missed, and to see all the crossover content that is still to come!my mind is still trying to process everything with theia and aidas (and helena and silene). i know rhysand is a descendant of theia and amren told him she was a prisoner of theia. But this book kind of makes it appear like amren was a captured ‚Äúpet monster‚Äù of silene. i need to do more research but amren connecting all the gods and theia is really cool and something i think the fandom has been wanting more confirmation of for a really long time.okay back to crescent city, hypaxia was amazing, as always! i just love my sapphic necromancer queen. i know i made the baldur's gate joke above, but wizards of the coast are quaking at her finding the antidote to defeat the parasites and still finding ways to make it more easily accessible and forever lasting. she is actually the real mvp of this book.ruhn, hunt, and baxian going through some dark stuff and making jokes to keep light getting out of that dungeon. I actually really loved seeing their friendship in this book, even if‚Ä¶ again, some dark stuff.i don‚Äôt want to talk about this, but ultimately i know i need to because i feel like this is the reason i am giving this book three stars, so let‚Äôs talk about it - bryce wasn‚Äôt my favorite in this book, sadly. her leaving cooper was just so cruel to me. i know many other reviewers are saying this, but bryce did so many things that made readers question that maybe she is turning into the villain (which might have been a little cool actually). but her leaving him behind was just wild to me. ember and randall showing they are upset because of this and voicing that bryce was wrong for leaving him still (or maybe even enhanced) made me so upset at her. But there were so many other instances too, like when she called lidia‚Äôs kids baggage? like when she told hunt to get over himself when the man was really going through it in those dungeons? what was all that? she felt so reckless and so careless and even heartless. ahhh i dont know, i just feel like bryce is easily my least favorite of sjm‚Äôs main characters, and i just liked her less and less each book, which feels so bad to say, but it really is how i feel.this is so random, but i also need to admit that i truly didn‚Äôt think cormac was dead dead, so i was so surprised when this book wrapped up and i guess that man really is! man oh man, i was truly waiting for that reveal and it just never came!okay, the ending! i loved seeing those three fire sprites truly saving the day. and them working at griffin antiquities at the end? oh, i really loved to see it. i shed many tears at jesiba actually saving the day, and i shed even more at bryce seeing danika and connor and everyone she loves waiting for her. and i did actually like the blackhole portal teleporting as well. the last 100 pages of this book were very strong and very heartfelt.and the very end? the way i truly wept at bryce's mom hugging and saying kind words to nesta. I actually felt insane with swollen eyes because of it. (the bam bonus chapter was probably my favorite of all the bonus chapters though. also, i just really want to live in the house of wind!) But yeah, i felt like this was a very strong ending to this book, and a very strong set up for whatever sjm does next! (probably with acotar now that nesta has the sword, dagger, mask, and a harp to potentially find bryce or whoever else whewwwww)lastly, because i cannot write a spoiler section review and not bring this up: when azriel said nyx is waiting too. oh, it got a tear from me. and bryce telling nesta and azriel how a phone works got a giggle from me. i truly cannot wait for whatever sjm gives us next.the acotar reread really came in clutch, especiallyacosf! But this whole reading experience just made me really want to reread tog asap! especially because (i can‚Äôt believe i am typing this) i think nesta is really making it hard for me to say that manon is my favorite sjm character!blog|instagram|youtube|kofi|spotify|amazon1.)Throne of Glass‚òÖ‚òÖ1.)A Court of Thorns and Roses‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ2.)A Court of Mist and Fury‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ3.)A Court of Wings and Ruin‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ3.1)A Court of Frost and Starlight‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ4)A \u200bCourt of Silver Flames‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'SJM??????Byrce ruined this whole book for me..I feel like SJM just wanted to throw in everything in one book and hoped for the best.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""I FINISHED‚Ä¶.IT‚ÄôS DONE.I will never recover from this series.

Despite my mixed feelings, I was completely engrossed the whole time and enjoyed it. It genuinely makes it hard to rate the book ü´† I‚Äôm leaning towards 3.5 stars. It's not to say it was a bad book; it‚Äôs just not what I thought it‚Äôd be, and it gave acompletely differentvibe to CC1&2.Spoilers ahead!!-----The book is extremely plot driven, and I loved learning about the universe‚Äôs lore! I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever wrap my head around everything revealed. How Sarah can think up these ideas and craft such intricate worlds, I have no idea!ü§ØPart 1 was intense!The crossover was amazing. I appreciated how the book remained a Crescent City book and wasn‚Äôt wholly overpowered by the crossover. However, I didn‚Äôt like that too much was revealed all at once, too quickly, and mainly through direct dialogue. It would have been better if Bryce had discovered things on her own instead of being told straight up. It was almost a little too convenient. It set the tone for the rest of the discoveries as well. Nothing was played out entirely to its full potential.The lore was amazing, there‚Äôs no denying that, but the execution of it could have been better. It felt flat and almost like a tick box exercise, unlike Sarah‚Äôs usual style. With the number of things that were revealed, it might have been better to split this into two books as it sometimes felt rushed. I can‚Äôt get over the fact that this entire book's timeline wasONE WEEK!If it could have been spread further, it would have worked so much better, and that way, it would have addressed the lack of depth.My main dislike of the book was the completelack of emotional connection. All the characters lost the usual flair they had in CC1&2. It was as if they all lost their personalities. And maybe that‚Äôs with it being plot driven, but something just felt off with them all, and there was a sort of emptiness to them. It‚Äôs the complete opposite of CC1&2. Those books had me sobbing, but with this one, I didn‚Äôt find it anywhere near as emotional as I thought it would be or what it attempted to be. My issues with this started to present during part 2, with the reunion of all the characters.It was so underwhelming.We know Sarah likes her POV switch ups, and I usually don‚Äôt mind it in any of her books, but something was off here. The switches were abrupt and often within the same chapter, so any emotional development happening instantly fell short, and I struggled to immerse myself. Not to be picky, but there were many grammatical errors, too. I found many missing quotation marks, which just ended up disrupting the flow even further, as I was like'wait, when did the dialogue start?'On the other hand, I didn‚Äôt find myself getting bored in anyone‚Äôs storyline since it was extremely fast paced. It was hard to find a good point to put it down as the plot and the story just never stopped!Bryce frustrated me so much!She almost felt like a completely different character, and her character arc was extremely messy and frankly made no sense. She was acting as if she knew everything and was so unserious. Thankfully, part 3 is where she starts to return to her usual self, and by the end of the book, I was thinking'there‚Äôs the Bryce I know and love'. But the arc she went on to get to that point was bizarre.Bryce and Hunt‚Äôs relationship is part of what made me love CC so much, but their relationship in this book was flat. It lacked the chemistry, banter, and warmth they usually had. Sarah, why on earth did you have them arguing after their reunion!?!?!? Why were they constantly at odds with each other? I thought they had resolved their trust issues in CC2, so I did not like the angst between them at all. I get that they‚Äôre portrayed as a real couple, but I‚Äôm sad at how it played out üò≠ They just needed to talk to each other and explain their feelings, but it was instantly shut down whenever they tried. That was primarily due to Bryce - I don‚Äôt understand why she acted as she did towards Hunt; she constantly dismissed his feelings. And again, the abrupt POV changes did not help. I‚Äôm glad they returned to normal in part 3, and I‚Äôm happy I got the bonus chapters between them to end it on a good note.Ruhn and Lidia were certainly a highlight!! There were loads of reveals about Lidia, which were completely unexpected. It made me love her even more. I must admit their relationship development felt awkwardly paced to me, though, which is such a shame because their romance journey could have been so much more beautiful üò≠Surprisingly, I enjoyed Tharion‚Äôs and Ithan‚Äôs chapters. They added a nice reprieve from the intensity and added some value to the journey towards the end.Part 3 saved the book for meand was the only part where I felt somewhat emotional, even though the ending was pretty convenient. At no point did I even fear for any character, as it just didn‚Äôt feel high stakes enough. Shahar‚Äôs appearance was such a lovely surprise. I loved the reveal of Brann‚Äôs name. I didn‚Äôt connect the dots with that one, so I jumped out of my skin at that!! The sprites were some of my favourite side characters, and the mentions of Lele were a nice touch too ü•∫ The Hel plot was handled well, and the reveal of Hunt‚Äôs father was a great twist.Overall,I‚Äôm feeling pretty bittersweet about it.Part 1 was good, I didn‚Äôt entirely like part 2, and part 3 saved it. It set up the next ACOTAR book well, and I can see how the next CC book will play out too.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîHAPPY HOFAS RELEASE DAY ü•≥‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîapparently the book has beenleakedand people are postingspoilersof the ending on twitter/tiktok etcüò≠ thankfully I haven‚Äôt seen anything but just had to give you guys a warning to be careful!!!‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîOMG we have a cover!!!Jan 2024 can‚Äôt come quick enough üò´""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Super Magical Starborn waste of my goddamn time.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'oh wow no one died again.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Go girl, give us nothing!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '""The Hind knelt before her undying masters and contemplated how it would feel to tear out their throats.""‚ù§Ô∏è\u200düî•-Line 1, Page 1.Spoiler Free Review.SJM has somehow managed to completely capture my heart and blow my mind once again!I want to start by saying that SJM never fails to completely capture my heart.

Sie w√ºnscht sich ihr altes Leben zur√ºck ‚Äì als sie auf dem Maxton Hall College niemand kannte und sie kein Teil der elit√§ren und verdorbenen Welt ihrer Mitsch√ºler war. Doch sie kann James nicht vergessen, vor allem nicht, als dieser alles daransetzt, sie zur√ºckzugewinnen ‚Ä¶","[{'rating': 5, 'content': 'Ich muss echt zugeben, dass mir ""Save You"" wahnsinnig gut gefallen hat und damit h√§tte ich ehrlich gesagt nicht gerechnet! Damals habe ich auch dem Vorg√§ngerband 5 Sterne gegeben, wenn ich aber daran zur√ºckdenke, muss ich allerdings zugeben, dass mich schon relativ viel an Ruby & James Geschichte gest√∂rt hat. Wenn ich Save Me nochmal lesen w√ºrde, w√ºrde meine Bewertung wahrscheinlich eher negativer ausfallen.Aber zur√ºck zu ""Save You"": Mona hat sich die viele Kritik anscheinend wirklich zu Herzen genommen, da viele nervige Details ausgebessert wurden und ich somit diesmal die Lesestunden besser genie√üen konnte. Mir hat es wirklich Spa√ü gemacht die Charaktere zu begleiten, was vor allen Dingen an den neu dazu gewonnen Perspektiven von Lydia & Ember lag. (Ich muss an dieser Stelle auch leider zugeben, dass ich Lydia und Graham mehr shippe als #Bellfort üòÇ).Die Art und Weise wie James hier mit seinen D√§monen zu k√§mpfen hatte, empfand ich als sehr realistisch, muss aber im Gegensatz dazu gestehen, dass ich mit Ruby immer noch nicht 100%ig warm werden konnte. Ich fand es trotzdem sch√∂n, dass sie sich nicht gleich auf Seite 1 wieder verziehen haben, sondern das ganze so seine Zeit gebraucht hat. Man merkt beim Lesen wirklich, dass die beiden sich perfekt erg√§nzen und zusammengeh√∂ren, da ich anfangs Zweifel hatte, ob sie wirklich ein gutes Paar abgeben k√∂nnten.Dieser Band war auf jeden Fall um l√§ngen besser als der erste und fiebere jetzt schon gespannt auf August hin, um den Abschluss der Reihe lesen zu k√∂nnen! üòç Stellt euch auf einen gemeinen Cliffhanger ein, aber diesmal ist es zum Gl√ºck kein so hinrissiger wie bei Save Me!'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Nach dem ich l√§nger dar√ºber nachgedacht habe, habe ich nochmal 0,5 Sterne abgezogen und der Band bekommt final nun 2 Sterne von mir.Es tut mir so leid das Buch so bewerten zu m√ºssen, weil ich Mona echt mag, aber nichtsdestotrotz muss ich ehrlich sein.Ich fand, dass sich die Geschichte ziemlich in die L√§nge gezogen hat, was zum Teil auch daran lag, dass es auch noch Kapitel aus Lydias und Embers Sicht gab. Gerade Embers Sicht hat f√ºr mich gar nicht in die eigentliche Story reingepasst und ich pers√∂nlich kann ihr auch gar nichts abgewinnen. Kurz gesagt, ich finde Ember ziemlich nervig. Lydias Sicht war eigentlich ganz interessant, aber auch hier bin ich der Meinung, dass es dem Buch gut getan h√§tte, wenn es diese nicht gegeben h√§tte. Allgemein w√§re es (glaube ich) besser gewesen Rubys und James Geschichte in einem Band zu erz√§hlen und dann in den anderen B√§nden auf andere Charaktere einzugehen.Ruby ist mir auch nicht sonderlich sympathisch. Ich finde, sie steigert sich teilweise zu sehr in die Sache rein. Klar James hat Mist gebaut, dass will ich auch gar nicht leugnen, dennoch muss man auch mal seine Sicht sehen und ihn ein wenig verstehen.Auch was zum Schluss passiert, konnte man sich eigentlich schon denken und der eigentlich gut geschriebene Cliffhanger w√ºrde in meinen Augen mit dem Epilog zu nichte gemacht.Was mir auch negativ aufgefallen ist, sind die Fehler in dem Buch. Ich habe 3 Logik- bzw. Wiederholungsfehler gefunden, die zwar nicht die Handlung beeinflusst haben, aber dennoch da waren. Dar√ºber hinaus gab es ein paar Schreibfehler, die mir aufgefallen sind und wo ich den einen Satz dreimal lesen musste bis ich bemerkt habe, dass da ein Wort zu viel ist und es deswegen keinen Sinn ergibt.Positiv hingegen war mal wieder der Schreibstil. Ich finde es fantastisch wie Mona Gef√ºhle und Situationen beschreibt. Man kam gut durch das Buch durch und auch wenn es langatmig war, gab es einige interessante Stellen im Buch und man m√∂chte dennoch wissen wie es weitergeht, auch wenn ich jetzt nicht sehns√ºchtig auf den dritten Teil warte.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'this series is not getting any better'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""unpopular opinion timeeee (aber vielleicht liegt es auch an mir und ich hab einfach kein Herz?)Ich wei√ü gar nicht genau, was f√ºr ein konkretes Problem ich mit der Reihe habe. Mittlerweile denke ich mir, dass man diese komplette Trilogie sicher auch in einen dickeren Band h√§tte stecken k√∂nnen, weil es mittlerweile ein wenig wie eine Seifenoper ist. Obwohl sich Ruby und James eigentlich lieben, passiert immer wieder irgendetwas Unn√∂tiges, um die beiden auseinander zu bringen. Dieses Hin und Her macht mich mittlerweile irgendwie m√ºde.Obwohl mir die meisten Charaktere gefallen (vor allem Lydia finde ich wirklich toll!), sind manche doch nur ihr Klischee (wie James' Eltern, der Direktor, Waren, der andere Freund, den sie Cys nennen oder so, und sogar Rubys Mutter?) und wirken auf mich unglaubhaft und total gek√ºnstelt. Vielleicht liegt das ja auch einfach an dem Genre oder ich bin zu alt. Ganz ehrlich finde ich auch, dass sehr vieles zwischen James und Ruby zu √ºberromantisiert ist... Sie wei√ü zwar, dass er mega sprunghaft ist, vergisst das aber von einem Moment auf den anderen? Und dann macht er auch eine 180-Grad Drehung mit seinem Leben wegen ihr? Er war ein partymachender drogennehmender Kerl, dann trifft er Ruby und alles √§ndert sich? Ich glaube ich mag nicht, welches Bild das so von Liebe macht. Ich denke, wir Frauen haben oft eine Helfersyndrom und wollen immer zwanghaft jemanden zum Guten bewegen, aber mittlerweile nervt das irgendwie nur auf sowas reduziert zu werden, wir sind doch nicht daf√ºr da, um solche Kerle zu bekehren oder sie zu retten...Ruby ist mir zwar ziemlich sympathisch, aber manchmal entscheidet sie sich auch von jetzt auf gleich um. Toll finde ich aber ihre Freundschaft mit Lydia und Linn!Noch ein extra Punkt, auf den ich eingehen will, ist das Ende....Wieso wird das ganze Buch √ºber das Bild einer echt harmonischen Familie aufgebaut, und dann glaubt Rubys Mutter ihr nicht? Das macht f√ºr mich absolut keinen Sinn und ist nur ein frustrierender, doofer Cliffhanger. Und dann ist die Mutter so super entt√§uscht von ihr, obwohl sie ihr nicht mal zugeh√∂rt hat... total √ºberdramatisch und unlogisch.Alles in allem hat es sich wieder sehr schnell gelesen und ich bin trotzdem gespannt auf den n√§chsten Band!

Allerdings bin ich kein gro√üer Fan von diesen wechselnden Perspektiven gewesen. Hier bekommen n√§mlich sowohl Lydia als auch Ember ihre eigene Story/Perspektive. Den Plot rund um Lydia fand ich an sich sogar ganz interessant, Ember hingegen fand ich einfach nur naiv und nervig...Abgesehen davon strotzt die Geschichte und die Charaktere wieder nur so vor Klischees und es las sich stellenweise echt wie eine billig produzierte Daily-Soap.

I am a ride or die Mona Kasten fangirl! Her books make me really happy and I just love her writing style. That‚Äôs why I seem to be flying through these books. I highly recommend her novels if you haven‚Äôt read them yet. ‚ù§Ô∏èSo here is what the romantic novel is about:Ruby ist am Boden zerst√∂rt. Noch nie hatte sie f√ºr jemanden so tiefe Gef√ºhle wie f√ºr James. Und noch nie wurde sie so verletzt. Sie w√ºnscht sich ihr altes Leben zur√ºck ‚Äï als sie auf dem Maxton Hall College niemand kannte und sie kein Teil der elit√§ren und verdorbenen Welt ihrer Mitsch√ºler war. Doch sie kann James nicht vergessen. Vor allem nicht, als dieser alles daransetzt, sie zur√ºckzugewinnen ...What I specifically loved about this story was the narrative structure. We finally got to hear Ember‚Äôs and Lydia‚Äôs stories as well and it was interesting to get a glimpse into their lives. I loved that Mona broke away from the traditional ‚Äòboy / girl narrative‚Äô. It definitely added more dimension to the story. Even though the stories had its weaknesses I could not give the novel less than 5 stars.The cliffhanger at the end of the book was not as unbearable as the one from the first book. But hey I still hate these types of endings when I know that third novel of this book series won‚Äôt be published until August. Why though!!! I need the next part asap!?!? üòÇI have to say the only issue that I had when reading the novel were the numerous typos...

Klar, es ist ganz nett f√ºr zwischen durch aber mehr eben auch nicht. Ruby & James waren langweilig und haben eigentlich nichts gemacht ausser mal wieder einen Ball & ein Charity Event zu organisieren (really?). Lydia war diejenige, die mich dazu gebracht hat weiter zu lesen. Warum kann es kein Buch √ºber sie geben?Das Ende war dann (wie immer) so gestaltet, das auch jemand, der kein Fan der Reihe ist, den 3. Band f√∂rmlich lesen muss. Danke an dir Person, die Plot-twists ins Leben gerufen hat (NICHT!).Band 1 hat uns alle an Gilmore Girls erinnert. Jetzt wechselt Mona Kasten zu Pretty Little Liars.Das Schlimmste war, wie Ruby uns Lesern pr√§sentiert wurde. Das soll eine engagierte Sch√ºlerin auf einem Elite College, an der sich M√§dchen in meinem Alter ein Beispiel nehmen sollen, darstellen? Ruby hat 0 Substanz.

Trotzdem wollte ich nat√ºrlich wissen wie es weitergeht.Meine MeinungDer Einstieg ist mir schwer gefallen, sogar richtig schwer. Man sollte vielleicht dazu sagen, dass ich in einer ziemlichen Leseflaute stecke und mir wohl kein Buch so gef√§llt wie sonst.Mein Hauptproblem war immer noch James. Nachdem er einiges durchgemacht hat, ist James nicht mehr ganz der gleiche wie vorher. Nur benimmt er sich am Anfang wie ein absoluter Vollidiot (tschuldigungüòÇ). Zum Schluss hin ist er mir sogar noch ein kleines bisschen sympathischer geworden, was mich tats√§chlich noch hoffen l√§sst üòÅ.Ruby bleibt f√ºr mich irgendwie eher blass ü§î.Mein Lichtblick waren wohl Lydia und Ember, denn es gibt tats√§chlich Kapitel aus ihrer Sicht üòç. Die Geschichten der beiden interessieren mich total üòÅ. Ich h√§tte es sogar fast besser gefunden, wenn es wie bei der Again Reihe gewesen w√§re, ein Band aus der Sicht von Ruby, einer aus der Sicht von Lydia und einer aus der Sicht von Ember üòÅ.Am Anfang konnte mich die Handlung leider so gut wie gar nicht √ºberzeugen üòï. Ich bin kaum reingekommen und teilweise war mir einfach alles egal was mit James und Ruby zu tun hatte.Ich kann nicht sagen, dass ich mich zu 100% auf Band 3 freue, aber ich muss einfach wissen wie es ausgeht, vor allem die Geschichte von Lydia, denn sie hat echt ein Happy End verdient!Trotz allem konnte der Schreibstil von Mona Kasten mich wieder √ºberzeugen. Obwohl ich von den Protagonisten nicht so begeistert bin, hat sich das Buch trotzdem super lesen lassen und ich war trotzdem neugierig wie es mit den beiden weitergeht!

Dazu werden auch Atmosph√§re und Setting immer lebhafter.Richtig gut finde ich die zus√§tzlichen Perspektiven. Ember mag ich total gerne und da sie nicht Teil des ganzen Maxton Hall Dramas ist, ist ihr Blick von au√üen interessant.Aber richtig begeistert war ich von den Gedanken und der Gef√ºhlswelt von Lydia. Sie ist verzweifelt aber stark und k√§mpft f√ºr das was ihr wichtig ist.Ihre und Grahams Story ist f√ºr mich eigentlich auch interessanter als die um Ruby James.Ruby ist nach wie vor ein starker Charakter bleibt in diesem Teil aber relativ blass. Daf√ºr macht sich James. Er leidet unter dem Verlust seiner Mutter und dann verliert er auch noch Ruby. Man merkt, dass er nicht immer so stark ist wie es scheint aber auch wie er sich M√ºhe gibt und k√§mpft, vor allem um ihr Vertrauen.Zwar ist das Ganze etwas vorhersehbar aber ich mag die Entwicklung. Und trotz des vielen hin-und-her gibt es keine L√§ngen, der Stil ist wie immer einfach toll und liest sich super schnell und fl√ºssig.Das Drama erinnert sehr an Gossip Girl aber ich mags und bin gespannt auf das Finale.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Relectura.

Teil √ºberhaupt lesen m√∂chte und ich habe mich irgendwie nicht √ºberwinden k√∂nnen daf√ºr 13‚Ç¨ auszugeben...Dann habe ich aber jetzt doch als E-Book angefragt und nun habe ich es doch gelesen.Der Cliffhanger am Ende des ersten Teils war ja schon ziemlich mies...""Save You"" setzt ziemlich genau da an, wo der erste Teil aufgeh√∂rt hat. Das hei√üt: mit Drama. Ich bin ja leider kein Fan von unn√∂tigem Drama in New Adult B√ºchern, aber das scheint irgendwie ein Bestandteil dieses Genres zu sein. Aber ich wollte trotzdem wissen, wie das Ganze weiter geht, wie sie wieder zueinander finden und so weiter.Also habe ich weitergelesen.Das erste viertel der Geschichte war anstrengend, meiner Meinung nach. Hin und her und wieder hin und her.Ruby scheint einfach nicht zu wissen, was sie will, bzw. wie sie handeln soll. Sie √§ndert ihre Meinung ziemlich oft und versucht ihre Gef√ºhle zu ignorieren, was nat√ºrlich nicht funktioniert.Auch dieses Argument ""Ich brauche noch Zeit, bevor wie dar√ºber reden k√∂nnen"".Zeit macht die Situation wohl eher schlimmer, als besser... Sie sind beide im College, schaffen es aber einfach nicht, normal miteinander zu sprechen? Ich wei√ü nicht....Der Mittelteil des Buches hat mir dann deutlich besser gefallen. Da kam √ºberhaupt erstmal richtig Story dazu. Streit stand nicht im Mittelpunkt, sondern andere Dinge, wie Ember, eine Gala und einiges mehr...Besonders gut gefallen hat mit diesmal, dass es viele verschiedene Sichtweisen gibt.Lin hat ein Kapitel, Lydia, James und auch Ember kommen diesmal zu Wort.Dadurch hat man sie alle viel besser kennengelernt.Das Ende wurde dann leider wieder etwas schw√§cher.Nat√ºrlich gibt es wieder ein Cliffhanger...

Now Scarlett‚Äôs father has arranged a marriage for her, and Scarlett thinks her dreams of seeing Caraval‚Äîthe faraway, once-a-year performance where the audience participates in the show‚Äîare over.But this year, Scarlett‚Äôs long-dreamt-of invitation finally arrives. With the help of a mysterious sailor, Tella whisks Scarlett away to the show. Only, as soon as they arrive, Tella is kidnapped by Caraval‚Äôs mastermind organizer, Legend. It turns out that this season‚Äôs Caraval revolves around Tella, and whoever finds her first is the winner.Scarlett has been told that everything that happens during Caraval is only an elaborate performance. Nevertheless she becomes enmeshed in a game of love, heartbreak, and magic. And whether Caraval is real or not, Scarlett must find Tella before the five nights of the game are over or a dangerous domino effect of consequences will be set off, and her beloved sister will disappear forever.Welcome, welcome toCaraval. . . beware of getting swept too far away.","[{'rating': 1, 'content': '*record scratch**freeze frame*Yup, that‚Äôs me. Scarlett Dragna, main character of the YA hit Caraval. You‚Äôre probably wondering how I ended up in this situation. If everysinglethingthathappenedinthiswholebook was anything to go by, it was through a combination of pointless lying, constant embarrassment, obsession with Some Guy, a big act of caring about a younger sister despite very little indication of that being true, unrelenting drama about a dumb wedding, repetitive interactions, weird descriptions, gender-based generalizations, and insanely personal info-dumps about emotional happenings from the past.(insert elegant bow here) And that, my dear friends, is my Scarlett Dragna impression. Thank you. Yes, thank you. Oh, please, stop with the standing ovation! I‚Äôm just like all of you. Except I possess such bitterness and have such a grasp of the future that I wrote a character description at the 25% mark, and god did it hold up.Yup. You guessed it. I didn‚Äôt like my most anticipated book of the year.https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...(What a surprise!you probably all chant in unison.)I almost felt guilty about writing a negative review about this book - because it‚Äôs about to be damn negative - but then I remembered it‚Äôs THIS BOOK‚ÄôS FAULT. It marketed its damn self as a young adultThe Night Circus. It must take some serious goddamn gonads to look at a masterpiece, essentially magic with a front and back cover, and go, ‚ÄúYeah. My book is just like that.‚Äù Spoiler alert: it‚Äôs really, really not.Oh, God, this review is going to be long. My bullet point list of notes alone is long. And I am putting away fruit snacks like nobody‚Äôs business, so I‚Äôve got enough sugar in my system to sustain a lengthy burst of anger. Strap in, everybody! (Note from later: I sugar-crashed when I was almost done this review. But it did last me through most of it.)THE SETTINGAll I want is a good setting. All those times I said I just want a good characterto love and settle down with, I think - and relish this rare gift of a moment - I think I was wrong. I think I care most about settings. (Hence why books with magnificent settings get five star ratings no matter what.) And thus, it is my curse to eternally pick up every book that is compared to The Night Circus.This book does not have a good setting. It‚Äôs confusing: everything that seems solid is gone back on later. Nothing is real. That doesn‚Äôt lead to a good setting. But I‚Äôll talk more about the constant, piece of sh*t cop-outs later in this review. It lacks the strong descriptions that a setting literally needs. It doesn‚Äôt feel magical at all. (More on that later, too.) But above all, it‚Äôs not goddamn GROUNDED.Haha. That GIF made me feel a little better. Thank you, my favorite person of all time forever, Bo Burnham. Anyway, as I was saying. This. Is. Not. Grounded. In Round 14 of 3947234829 why The Night Circus is better than this book and the latter should never have been compared, TNC takes place inour world. Yeah. The author (presumably) realized 1) maybe we need a little bit of magic! And 2) she couldn‚Äôt create one of the greatest settings of all time while also establishing a fantasy world. It would have weakened the whole book.But Stephanie Garber did NOT make the same choice. Instead, we‚Äôre unceremoniously dumped into a world where there are islands and colonizing empires and that CLASSIC YA trope of using clunky terms to differentiate the world from the real one (like Hot Season, because they don‚Äôt have WORDS FOR THE SEASONS). Even more fun, during this book characters travel between countries/colonies/islands/empires/I have no idea, and the reader has NO GODDAMN CLUE WHAT IS GOING ON.Alright, I think I‚Äôve talked about the setting for too long. I see that now. But this is an UNFORGIVABLE OFFENSE, OK?THE CHARACTERSWe‚Äôre introduced to a world‚Äôs worth of characters here, and this book achieves quite a feat - they all manage to be either flat, boring, or both! Yaaaaay! I‚Äôm totally ready to try to pretend to feel emotionally connected to these goons for 400 pages!!First: Scarlett. Cannot believe we were trapped inside the head of the most boring character of all time throughout what was supposed to be a suspenseful thrill ride! (But, obviously, was not.) She‚Äôs easily embarrassed, obsessed with propriety, falls in pretty much instalove with Julian because he‚Äôs hot. Lies all the time because poor widdle gal is embarrassed of something or other about herself. Super weak. Constantly questioning her own reasoning and letting others make decisions for her. Tries to act like she‚Äôs a protective older sister, but, speaking as a protective older sister, she doesn‚Äôt give much of a sh*t about family when she‚Äôs staring into Julian‚Äôs eyes or literally sucking his fingers.But then we get into a whole different type of characters: Those who, by the end, we know NOTHING. ABOUT. Tella, Julian, Legend. We‚Äôre given descriptions of them that are gone back on, returned to, and gone back on again. Nothing is real. The whole thing is confusing and an absolute waste of energy. I came SO GODDAMN CLOSE to DNFing this book because it has about 100 twists andnone of them make sense.I wanted to shake myself out of a nightmare. What the hell was going on for 400 pages?!Beyond that, they‚Äôre boring and I don‚Äôt want to talk about them. And so were the ‚Äúvillains.‚Äù Scarlett and Tella‚Äôs dad is literally ruthless for no reason. His wife left him and now he plays psychological games of abuse with his daughters. There‚Äôs a moment where he essentially tries to get his daughter‚Äôs fianc√© to rape her. And for what reason? It makes no sense. No sense at all. He slaps a random girl across the face at one point, murders some random dude. I don‚Äôt know what excuse to make for that except that this book is sloppy.THE PLOTWord to the wise...if you haven‚Äôt read this book, you may want to skip this section. Even the stuff I don‚Äôt mark as spoilers may be somewhat spoilery. I‚Äôll try, kind of.So this book centers on Caraval, the supposedly wonderful setting I‚Äôve already moped about for way too long. Caraval attracts a bunch - well, an unknown number of people, and is supposed to be a scavenger-hunt-style game. Somehow, though, in spite of the bajillion people who actually give a sh*t competing against her, Scarlett juststumblesinto the goddamn clues.Here‚Äôs my world famous (I‚Äôve become famous since the beginning of this review, right?) Scarlett impression, coming back to show you what following her through this shindig feels like. ‚ÄúOh, this terrible poem-slash-cheat sheet I was unceremoniously given says I have to ‚Äòearn‚Äô the next clue! It‚Äôs probably just this thing I randomly picked up along my travels with zero fanfare! Or maybe it has something to do with a situation I just stumbled into! Doesn‚Äôt matter which choice I make, somehow it‚Äôll be manipulated into being the right one!‚Äù Where are the stakes?!I also feel like 80% of this is just us listening to boring old Scarlett being like, ‚ÄúOmg, I think Julian is lying to me. Whatever shall I do?! I don‚Äôt trust him!!! I just want to kiss his face off!!!‚Äù Etc, etc. And despite spending ALL OF HER TIME with him, she‚Äôs never just like:And when Scarlett‚Äôs piece of shit dad shows up with her fianc√© to like, punch her in the stomach until she says she‚Äôll make babies or whatever, she and luhhhhhhverboy have the DUMBEST REACTION. They get caught in a poor widdle thunderstorm, stop to make out for somewhere between 90 minutes and 7 hours, and get caught by the Dynamic Duo of Bad Characters‚Ä¶despite being about 1 f*cking yard away from an entrance to a hidden tunnel system.An entrance they knew about all along! I wish they both died.Also: two deaths, neither real, both anticlimactic and annoying. Not. A. Fan. That‚Äôs literally just a ploy to make it seem like your dumb book has the emotional depth it strives for. WHICH IT ABSOLUTELY DOESN‚ÄôT.And this book is just one cop out after another. Weird choice to write a supposed ‚Äú‚Äú‚Äú‚Äúhigh fantasy‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù book without wanting to define your world at all! Everything that is said definitively is gone back on, so many conflicting descriptions of Caraval are given that I couldn‚Äôt summarize them if I tried, and on top of all that, we don‚Äôt even get answers at the Big Reveal.LANGUAGEThis book is written...weirdly. For one thing, Scarlett, in order to remind us of her special snowflake status, sees emotion in COLOR. It is straight up so annoying. Here are a handful of my least favorite instances, for your readinghorrorenjoyment.1. ‚ÄúShe could see the sting of her rejection in shades of stormy blue, ghosting over his heart like sad morning mist.""2. ‚ÄúPeriwinkle curiosity‚Äù (I donÔøΩÔøΩt know why I hate that one so much. I just really do.)3. ‚ÄúIt would have been a mistake to kiss him, yet she felt ‚Ä¶ disappointed. It came in cool shades of forget-me-not blue, which wrapped around her like evening fog, making her feel hidden enough to acknowledge that she wanted to experience more of Caraval‚Äôs pleasures than she would ever have admitted out loud.‚ÄùDid you notice anything besides how irritating that quirk is? Numbers 1 and 3 are pretty much the DAMN SAME. What the hell?!The language in this book isn‚Äôt always AWFUL, it‚Äôs just...weird. Every sentence is very overwrought. Like, not everything has to have figurative language. Here‚Äôs my favorite example: The worst poem I have ever, ever read is in this book. And I‚Äôm an English major who hates poetry. Would you like to read it?""This girl was last seen with Legend.If you catch her, you shall catch him as well.Of course, you may have to venture through Hell.But if you succeed you may find yourself rich.This year‚Äôs winner will be granted one wish.""I do have to give this book some props, because this is the first time I have ever had to shut a book for 90 seconds in order to hysterically laugh. No one ever told me that the word ‚Äúrich‚Äù rhymes with ‚Äúwish‚Äù! Hahahaha. This poem should be used to teach the importance of using meter.GENERAL STUPIDITYI haven‚Äôt had the absolute privilege of writing one of these sections in a while! It‚Äôs like a homecoming. An unpleasant, unwanted homecoming. Like if my home was a festering swamp, or a city sewer system.Here‚Äôs one beautiful example - seriously, it‚Äôs like a gift from the reviewing gods: ‚ÄúThen she did her best to explain the truth about death and Caraval. Tella didn‚Äôt know the particulars as to how it worked. It was one of those things that people didn‚Äôt really talk about.‚Äù See what I mean?! Instead of the author coming up with an actual defined magic system, she just says ‚ÄúOh, um...well the character doesn‚Äôt know. There‚Äôs that!‚Äù The world has no definition and neither does the magic. In other words, some of the sloppiest fantasy I‚Äôve ever had the privilege to read.Plus, there‚Äôs a lot of weird stuff going on with hooking up with your family members‚Äô sloppy seconds. I don‚Äôt want to talk about it because I‚Äôm grossed the f*ck out. I just want to let everyone know I‚Äôm SUPER not a fan.There‚Äôs also a fun moment where Scarlett lectures her sister on how ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be in love with someone you just met,‚Äù even though a) she fell in luuurve with Julian in less than 5 days and b) she was planning on marrying someone she‚Äôd never met, and thought she could tell he was a good guy THROUGH LETTERS. So dumb.And then maybe my favorite moment of all: When a fortune teller tells Scarlett she wants ‚Äúlove and protection,‚Äù her reaction is even worse than I would have expected from a character I hate. She says, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that what every girl wants?‚Äù WHAT. THE. DAMN. HELL. No! No, not every girl, you piece of shit! It‚Äôs fine to want that, but some girls want adventure and knowledge and friendship and bravery and the ability to look out for their damn selves! What the actual f*ck?!Bottom line: I can‚Äôt believe how much I hated this book. (Or how long this review is.) Boring setting, boring characters, boring plot. Overall confusing language and decisions and reveals. I honestly wish I had never read this book.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I feel the same way aboutCaravalas I did aboutThe Star-Touched Queenlast year. In fact, many of my comments are the same, so if you enjoyed that book then it\'s probable you will like this one also.Caravalis a fantasywithout world-building or significant character development. It relies on its dreamy descriptions,purple prose, and a heavy helping of romance to make it dazzle. To take a quote from my review ofThe Star-Touched Queen, ""if you buy into these metaphors, put on your prose-tinted glasses and let yourself get drunk on the glittering descriptions, I suppose you might be able to ignore..."" that\'s literally how I feel about this.It is about two sisters - Scarlett and Tella - who live on some random island in the middle of random world X with their abusive father who wants to marry Scarlett off to a count she\'s never met. Caraval is, as it sounds, a carnival-like game on another random island. People go there to play and if they win, they get a wish. The mysterious Caraval master is a guy called Legend, who Scarlett has been writing to for years, but he has now finally replied - and sent three tickets for Scarlett, Tella and Scarlett\'s fiance. Upon arrival at the island, Tella goes missing and it soon becomes apparent that finding her is all a part of the game. Scarlett must solve the clues and find her sister before Caraval is over.For one thing, this is a writing style that never appeals to me. So many metaphors and similes that I know are supposed to be evocative and exciting,but they\'re nonsensical. Phrases like this:‚ÄúIt smelled like the middle of the night‚Äù‚ÄúHe tasted like midnight and wind‚Äù‚ÄúTella‚Äôs expression fell, like a doll Scarlett had dropped.‚ÄùI understand that some readers like this kind of mysterious, weird writing, but it just pulls me right out of the story. I\'m sat there thinking ""how the hell does something TASTE LIKE MIDNIGHT?"" What does it even mean that Tella\'s expression fell like a doll that Scarlett dropped? Does it mean that Tella is like a doll being dropped (i.e. unhappy doll?) or is the author equating the downwards turn of her expression with the downwards fall of a doll? Or neither - it just sounds good?And here, have some more:‚ÄúSomething about him made her feel perilous shades of silky black.‚Äù‚ÄúThe world tasted like lies and ashes when Scarlett woke.‚Äù‚ÄúSomething acidic and moldy and burnt bubbled up through Scarlett‚Äôs throat - the taste of death.‚ÄùLet‚Äôs forget for a second that death now has a ‚Äútaste‚Äù - is the author just listing random words that sound cool? Think about it. How can something taste acidic AND moldy AND burnt? I just don\'t believe that good writing is collecting as many exciting, descriptive words as possible and shoving them all together, regardless of whether they make any sense.But whatever. That\'s just taste for the writing style. I personally thought the story was lacking too, unless you are seekingmore romance and descriptions of male muscles than actual fantasy and mystery. From the very beginning, Scarlett goes on and on about the gorgeous men around her - Julian and Dante - often forgetting that her sister is missing because she is so caught up in her own romantic ambitions. And, of course, when Julian is seen talking with another girl, said girl is described as ""some tart in a bar""; in comparison to Scarlett who blushes every time Julian looks at her.He had the sort of profile meant for sculptors and painters. Full lips, strong jaw, coal-dark eyes sheltered by thick, dark brows.Do you think that she means ""sculptures"" and ""paintings"" instead? Or is it a stereotype I don\'t know about that artists are supposed to have a certain sort of profile? Anyway...I found so much of this book unsatisfying. I gave it an extra star because it remained interesting enough for me to read to the end, but there\'s not much more than a flowery romance contained within these pages. The mysteries and reveals are not particularly exciting, and there\'s a poorly-executed end moment where a character reveals everything through a long speech - like a magician dropping character at the end and telling the audience how they did it.Also, as a side note - and I wasn\'t sure if I was going to mention this or not - I got a very strong sense that I had read this story before. Most people probably won\'t know what I\'m talking about. But back when I was about eleven/twelve years old, I read a book calledThe Forbidden Gameby the same author who wroteVampire Diaries, about a girl who gets pulled into a game and must find her friends before the time is up. There\'s also a mysterious, gorgeous guy called Julian pulling the strings (holy shit, I was in love with him back then) and this book isso similar. Really. It makes me wonder if the author read it too.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Welcome, welcome to Caraval! The grandest show on land or by sea.Ever since Scarlett was a child, she heardtales of the wonderful, mysterious and dangerous Caraval.Trapped on a tiny island by her monster of a father, Scarlett dreams of nothing but attending.Hundreds and hundreds of peoplehope and begfor a position in the games all in the attempt to obtain the grand prize -a single wish.Much to Scarlett\'s delight and terror, just a few days before her weddingshe receives an invitation.At the insistence of her younger sister (Tella) and a mysterious boy, Scarlettescapes her island home and tyrannical father to enter the games.Only, things do not go as planned. Her sister is missing and the dangers are mounting - will she be able to make it to her wedding?Will she be able to make it out alive?The main problem I had with this book is the decision-making skills, the ""magic"" and the general YA ness. Unfortunately, that overshadowed the book.The Decision-Making skills -aka we are always going for the worst option, aren\'t we?There\'s being sheltered...and then there\'s being extremely stupid.Scarlett Dragna falls under the latter.There were so many, many times I wanted to shake her - if there is choice between a dark, dank ominous cave vs a gentle sunlight path, she\'d be halfway down the cave-monster\'s gullet before I could blink.She just has a knack for that sort of thing.It probably doesn\'t help that despite repeated assurances that:What happens beyond this gate may frighten or excite you, but don‚Äôt let any of it trick you. We will try to convince you it‚Äôs real, but all of it is a performance. A world built of make-believe.Our lovely Scarlett believes everything -every single thing- that is said to her.The Magic -aka it\'s not SUPPOSED to be realistic, HahaI loved the idea of the Caraval - the ethereal magic, the enigma of the game and (of course) the trickery of Legend.But, the book fell short.The world-building needed to be significantly stronger. For a world that was purported as being one of intense magic and intrigue, everything was a bit meh and haphazard.The author used the excuse ""but it\'s magic""as a crutch sofreakingmuch.To explain: there\'s magic worlds out there that I believe 100%.Harry Potter, for example, was beautifully fleshed out. Yes, it was pure magic but it was also purely believable.I could instantly tell you what would and wouldn\'t make sense in this world.Caraval... not so much.The author has all thesewild crazy ideasand instead of building and connecting them... she just called it magic and that was it...For example, one of the bigger things in this novel was the clothing changes.A dress changes color, shape, form? And is the perfect size? How?Magic!... but... how? Is it a spell? Enchanted object? Mysterious ancient witchcraft?It\'s magic!No seriously. How do you have godlike seamstress powers?I SAID IT WAS MAGICOkay. So there\'s magic dresses. But how does that connect to the magic people? Mysterious sellers? Artifacts?Magic. *cocks gun*So... ultimately, the magic was used as a cool and trendy tool rather than a fleshed out aspect of the world.General YA-ness -aka this sounds familiarOf course, because this is YA romance, all the big kisses had to have oddly-specific descriptions:He tasted like midnight and wind, and shades of rich brown and light blue.And, even better:It tasted like the moment before night gives birth to morning. It was like the end of one thing and the beginning of something else all wrapped up togetherSwoooooon.The 2018 PopSugar Reading Challenge - A book recommended by someone else taking the PopSugar Reading ChallengeAudiobook CommentsThe tone and inflection were alright, but listening to it fell a bit flat. I think it was because how frustrated I was with Scarlett\'s decisions...

I was intrigued by the summary from the second I found this was coming out, but had no clue if it would live up to the hype. The back cover boasts of‚ÄúThe spell-casting fantasy destined to become a sensation‚Äùand Fox 2000 has already purchased the rights to turn this into a major motion film, which claims some pretty mind-blowing story is within the covers. This book was even better than I could have imagined and then some.Hi, my name‚Äôs Chelsea and I‚Äôm addicted to Stephanie Garber‚Äôs world of Caraval.The blurb tells you everything you need to know going in; honestly, the less you know the better and the more confused you feel, the more enjoyable your reading experience will be. Every single chapter had some sort of twist, and whether it was minor or major, it got me. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. This book was somehow 400 pages, but it went by too quickly. I kept saying ‚ÄúJust one more chapter‚Äù and next thing you know, it was finished. Sort of. BecauseYAYbook #2 is coming! Well, once she writes it of course. (No pressure Steph. I‚Äôm only gnawing my nails to the bloody nub in anticipation.)Surprisingly, one of my favorite things about this book was the budding romance between Julian and Scarlett. I must be maturing (HAH!) and opening my reading door to some new things, because years ago this would have grossed me out to the core. The good news is it isn‚Äôt gross and cheesy; the tension continually grows throughout the book but it is really quite clean. This is something I wouldn‚Äôt bat an eye at letting my teenager read; the romance was tastefully done and, while refraining from being cheap and raunchy, sucked the reader in as the relationship grew. IMO, this showed what true talent the author had in being able to gain the reader‚Äôs interest in her romantic composition without relying on overdone sexual situations that are graphic and distracting from the heart of the story.JULIAN.I know Scarlett is supposed to the the show stopper here, but Julian stole the limelight for me. I fell in love with his character from the first page he showed up; he‚Äôs rugged, bold, and hilarious while carrying meaningful dialogue and playing a deeper role than just eye candy. I found myself cheering for him constantly throughout the story, and even when suspicion is cast his way multiple times (which both was rightly and wrongly cast), I couldn‚Äôt have cared less. This series I believe was set up, not as a complete focus on one character with many supporting roles, but as a character study on multiple people with a more complex story that interweaves multiple interests. While it is told mostly through Scarlett‚Äôs POV, we have a view into other‚Äôs interests as well, and the massive cliff hanger on the final page has set this up to be a strong series that should continue without a hitch.There is an overall dark feel to this book, and there is some disturbing violence in a fantasy-related sense, but it was necessary and intriguing to the story line. The mystery surrounding Legend and his traveling Caraval performers was breathtaking; I found myself completely lost in this otherworld. To me, it had a historical fiction feel with a side of science fiction due to the fantasy aspect, which made for a unique read. I‚Äôm not sure what else to add, other than I have an advanced case of Caraval hangover and need the book #2 cure ASAP. If you enjoy Young Adult novels, regardless of your age, you‚Äôll want to open your heart and your book shelf up to this one. I hate writing reviews this far in advance for a book that doesn‚Äôt come out until next year, but go ahead an pre-order, make a note to yourself to request at your library in January, or go to NetGalley and request your copy, because it will have a guaranteed spot on my Top 10 Wrap Up at the end of the year.*I received my copy from the publisher.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""This freaking book HOLY CRAP.I have a feeling this book is going to be a huge hit when it comes out, and rightfully so.

It's been blowing up GR for quite a while now. People with ARC were selling it on eBay at ridiculously high prices. That's how it caught my attention in the first place. Was that a publicity stunt? If it was, it's not going to help much because the book is shitty. There is nothing new or exhilarating here. If anything, it's ideas stolen from a bunch of other books, The Lunar Chronicles, Hunger Games, Night Circus and such. There was no originality here whatsoever, on top of all that IT'S BORING AF!The only characters who held my attention were Iko(TLC much?)and Dante. Obviously, if you are interesting, you aren't good enough for this book. They are no one of relevance. :/Let's talk about Scarlet, our main character. I really tried to like just because of that name of hers. Scar from Lunar Chronicles is my absolute favorite! Unfortunately, similarities don't go any further than their name. This Scarlet is one of those characters who we are constantlytoldis clever, adventurous, and ambitious. Let me tell you right now, she is none of those things. Scarlet is gutless and way too naive for my taste. I'm sorry, but i didn't find her to be very intelligent either. Many times i was baffled by her ignorance. These riddles weren't even hard to crack, but it took Miss Scarlet pages and pages crying over totally random and irrelevant things till correct answers would slap her right in the face. THEN things would click in her tiny brain.Legend is the Darkling figuremore like an insult to Darkling's greatness. He is the mysterious host of Caraval. He is dangerous. He is crazy. He is the villain. No one has ever met him, nor do they have any idea what he looks like. He wears a new face every year. And he sees everything. In other words, BLAH BLAH BLAH. At first, i was aboard. I was totally anticipating meeting this Leged. However, at one point his name started irritating me because it's all just talk. He isn't even in the book!Julian is a young sailor who helped Scarlet and her sister escaped their evil father. He gave me massive Captain Carswell Thorne vibes. Of course, me being trash for TLC didn't need anything more. When i started looking at Julian as his own character, not Carswell wannabethat's pretty much what he washis character is flat/painfully predictable. Didn't buy the romance for a second. It was merely anticlimactic.This being said, please don't let me discourage you from reading this. What do I know, I am just a crazy woman who is super picky when it comes to fiction.

It was whimsical, off the charts electric, romantic, mysterious, enchanting, enthralling... full of twists and turns. So many that I thought the ending couldn't possibly live up to the mystery this created.. but it absolutely did.My advice is to go into this knowing NOTHING. Seriously, I wanted to throw like 10 billion quotes in my review because I loved it THAT MUCH but its going to be so much more mysterious if you just dive right in. But I'll say this - I was hooked from the first page. There's a series of letters that Scarlett writes to the 'Caraval master' Legend over a series of years. This story begins when he finally writes back.I loved the writing and the pacing so so much. It wasn't too slow but it wasn't too fast either - it was just right for the character development. Scarlett was the perfect choice for an MC and I loved being in her mind without any outside perspective. Everything about the plot and the other characters are a complete mystery. Good luck trying to guess everything... you'll need it. The best part of the experience for me personally was trying to guess who was who and who was good/bad.I literally cannot comment on any of the other characters because it would be a spoiler - but oh man.. you guys. I think I'm in love.And the end? CLEVER. Wow. I LOVED IT SO MUCH. I thought Stephanie was writing herself into a hole with all the mystery but boy oh boy did she deliver.The setting is another win for this book. If you like the Night Circus, you'll be pleased. (The plot is totally different but the magical circus/carnival like atmosphere is on point.)Alright, I know I've done nothing but hyped up this book. Do yourself a favor though- go in with zero expectation, spoilers, hints, etc. Just enjoy the ride.Now excuse me while I go work on fan art because this has taken over my world.My Blog~Instagram~Twitter~Etsy""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""‚Äî‚Äî 3.75‚ú∞ stars.‚ÄúWhatever you've heard about Caraval, it doesn't compare to the reality.

Loved it! ‚ù§I guess I should put up the big ole spoiler label just in case I get spoilery!First off let me just get this off my chest. I wanted to smack Scarlett about 15 times during the book because she said this one thing about 50 billion times.I have to get back to get married. I have to get back to get married. I have to get back to get married. I have to get back to get married. I have to get back to get married. <-- Okay those are not the EXACT words but still - ya get me?But I digress =)The sexual tension between Scarlett and Julian could melt butter! And gave me some twinges at times. Good twinges!I guess I should just crack on with the book =)Soooooooooooo, Scarlett and Donatell (Tella) have a jerk face for a father and they are stuck on an island with him. He will do horrible things to them or other people if they dare try to escape. But Scarlett has a way out, she is to marry some dude her father set her up with and take her sister, Tella, with her. Scarlett has never met this man and her father won't tell her anything about him. Like that's not sketchy.When Scarlett was younger she used to write letters to Master Legend for years trying to get him to come to their island with his Caraval. Of course he never comes but one day many moons later he sends a letter to Scarlett inviting her and Tella and a guest to his Caraval on an island down on the right.Scarlett is so happy but she knows she won't be able to go because she will be getting married soon but Tella gets her to go. It's an unsavory way but Scarlett, Tella and Julian (whom Tella met while he was visiting their island) all end up at Caraval. And it's crayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy! Things and people are not what they seem.And they say that Legend creeps around watching people. You also have the choice of watching the show or participating in the show to get a special wish at the end if you are the winner. But the show can drive you mad.Turns out Tella is put into the show and everyone in the show must find her or she could die! What? Julian decides to help Scarlett out and it's so freaking good!I'm shutting my mouth and not saying another thing because you need to read it and find yourself in the crazy land of Caraval.

It's more than just a game or a performance. It's the closest you'll ever find to magic in this world.‚ùûThank you to Flatiron Books for sending me an advance reading copy of Caraval for review purposes.4.5 STARSThis book was just absolutely ENCHANTING! I didn't know how high or how low to set my expectations before going into Caraval but one thing is for sure by the time I closed this book: Caraval surpassed all my expectations and more. I've always been a sucker for circus/carnival themed books but I never read another book that came close to one of my favorite circus tales and favorite books of all time, The Night Circus. But Caraval has easily set its place right next to The Night Circus as one of the most magical stories I have ever read.From the very first page up until the last, there was never a dull moment while reading Caraval. It was just an enigma wrapped in magic and deception. One minute you think you have the story and the characters all figured out, the next minute the storyline takes you on a completely different direction! There were just so many twists, turns, and puzzles that every page leaves you hanging at the edge of your seat.Although Caraval didn't really feel like it took place in a circus/carnival like I was hoping it would, the world building was still very mystical. Clues and objects are paid in your deepest secrets, greatest fear, or even days of your life. There are tunnels that drive you mad and make you question what is real and what is simply part of the game. Caraval was just full of so many surprises that'll keep you turning the page. I had so many theories right from the very beginning that kept changing and evolving as the story progressed. I was so immersed in trying to crack the big mystery that was Caraval and Legend. Remember that it's just a game. But is it really? ;) This book will definitely leave you with more questions than answers in the end so prepare to be mind blown!I can't even put into proper words how magical this book truly is. Of course I can't speak for everybody, but I can almost guarantee that you'll never read a story like Caraval! Stephanie Garber has made quite the entrance into this community with this captivating piece of work. I almost can't believe that Caraval is actually her first book! I can see so much potential in this author and in this world that she has created. I definitely can't wait for book two because something tells me that Stephanie has more tricks and magic up her sleeve for her readers! :)*** The quote in this review was taken from an uncorrected proof and should be compared to the final copy upon release.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Àö. ‚ú∂ ‚ãÜ ·≠°4.25 stars‚Äìspoilers are marked‚ï∞ ‚úß ◊Å›Ç ‚Äúwelcome, welcome to caraval!‚Äù.À≥Àñoverall thoughts:‚Çä‚Äßwell i actually lowered my rating because i didn't think the book was that good but 4.25 is still great! i'm absolutely in love with the world and was so heavily immersed in it, it made me love the fantasy genre even more and realise how much i missed it <33 and when i was reading it i really wanted to read legendary after it because it was so good!! absolutely adored how magical this was!‚ï∞ ‚úß ◊Å›Ç ‚Äúwhen his soft lips touched her skin the entire world shattered into a million shards of colored glass.‚Äù.À≥Àñcharacters:‚Çä‚Äßscarlett: she was my favourite character and was very different from donatella. she knew how to take care of things and did usually handle the matter presented to her.donatella: to be honest, i found her character to be more impulsive and stuff, unlike her sister.julian: he was actually so cute""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '2.5 stars. I unfortunately was not a big fan of Caraval, which is very disappointing to me considering I was really excited for it!Pretty much, everything about this book fell short for me. Every character was bland and annoying with no personality. The romance had absolutely no substance in my opinion, I never felt any chemistry or understood why they got together other than the fact that they were basically one of the only people available to the other. The setting of Caraval was so much less magical and whimsical than I anticipated, and even the darker portions of the performance weren\'t dark enough! The tagline is ""It\'s all an elaborate performance,"" but it felt nothing like a performance at all. It felt like one big, wishy-washy scavenger hunt, not the *amazing, adventurous* experience we\'re lead to believe.The magic system itself really irked me. It felt like a bad case of ""This happens because !*~.- m A g I c -.~*!"" with very little explanation as to how the magic works. I don\'t feel there were many limitations, and the restrictions that were present weren\'t all that clear. The magic system was severely underdeveloped in my opinion, which is a big issue for me as a reader.There definitely were points where I was more interested and entertained by the story (thought those only occurred when I could block out at least a 3 hour uninterrupted period, which is not typical for my audiobook listening) but overall, it was a tough book to get through. I don\'t often consider putting books down, but there were times when I questioned why I was still listening and contemplated not finishing it.Ultimately, this book felt very juvenile for me (that is not to say books intended for younger readers are not as good!) but I tend to enjoy more mature YA novels. That being said, I can see why there is so much hype for this book, especially within readers younger than myself. I think younger Emma MIGHT have enjoyed it more, considering I don\'t look at books the same way I did at 17.I\'m not sure if I\'d read book two, I\'d have to see how I feel about this story around the time it comes out. But considering I felt Caraval would have fared better as a standalone, it just doesn\'t seem like this series is for me.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is my second time reading this as I was lucky enough to receive an ARC of the audiobook from Macmillan audio (thank you so much to them!)

For years her father tore her down. Over and over, she had let him. She‚Äôd allowed him to make her feel worthless and powerless. But she was neither of those things.

There are a few nice quotes here and there, but nothing remarkable. Dialogues andattemptedbantering included.Gosh, those dialogues. *shivers* I‚Äôll have nightmare for days.The characters are infuriatingly undefined.Their personalities and traits are smudgy on their borders. They all read the same way, they all look and talk the same, and they lack of substance, insomuch that, still now, I can‚Äôt understand what the deal was with a lot of them.Scarlett is not that bad, but if I had to tip the scale in favor of a concrete judgment, I‚Äôd say she‚Äôs an easily forgettable character.Sometimes I found myself wanting to jump into the book, grab her by her shoulders and give her a vigorous shake because, holy crow, her obliviousness got on my nerves more times than I can count.She‚Äôs really insecure and timorous, yet patsy and judgy to the point of aversion.To an extent, I see how her father‚Äôs abuse has a part in all of this. Yet, as someone who‚Äôs supposed to be the tough and motherly sister, I feel like she‚Äôs way too immature and na√Øve, too ready to give away her feelings to those who don‚Äôt deserve it.Still, I‚Äôm not holding any of this against her, because poor Scarlett is basically an unconsciously willing victim of circumstance.Tella, on the other hand‚Ä¶She's so flipping selfish and dumb. I really hope Scarlett will grow some balls and tell her off. Oh, scratch that, just give her a well deserved noogie.Julian, Mr Love Interest, could not be there and I wouldn‚Äôt notice, or wouldn‚Äôt care. I probably would have liked him more if he wasn‚Äôt always trying so hard. His purposes and aims are so conventionally confined into the ‚Äútypical mysterious good-looking guy‚Äù category, and his flirting is so bland that you can‚Äôt even go past the fact that he‚Äôs just another pretty face in another unpretty book.I‚Äôm not even gonna waste my words on Legend and all the *sarcastic air quotes* mystery that surrounds him. Fuck you, you old fart. Give me my money back.Luckily enough, the plot is probably the thing I liked the most, even if I probably hyped this book too much in my own head to the point it took me exactly 270 pages to feel the reader‚Äôs high.The setting is gorgeous, I got to give it to the author. Had she wrote about flowers and dresses and a whole another kind of circus-like place (one where, supposedly, Scarlett is a badass and Tella is participating in an Erasmus program in Grunland), I would have fallen hard for it.I wish she‚Äôd focused more on describing the surroundings, giving more space and a proper background story to more secondary characters, instead of going on, pages and pages, about feelings and stuff.However, I loved the way everything merges together and gives the story, its performers and the entirety of Caraval, this Venetian, carnivalesque freak-show kind of halo.Alas, things started to get interesting when I was already too far into the book and already too oriented towards a negative outcome, so I probably didn‚Äôt even enjoy it as much as I could have.I kind of was expecting that ending, to be honest.It‚Äôs the kind of book that requires something shocking, that leaves people with their mouth and eyes wide open buuuut...nope, I'm not impressed at all.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '2.75 stars‚ùõ My little liar, Julian mouthed.‚ùúThe writing held a contradictory connotation, to my opinion.It rocked from a polished, opulent vocabulary and exquisite metaphors to an atrociously neglected characters‚Äô depth and world building. Some scenes were vividly and graphically descriptive from the costumes to the atmosphere surrounding our protagonists but they lacked explanation when it came to Scarlett‚Äôs feelings and thoughts,she partially felt shallowexcept from some verbal jousts with Julian. Plus,the magic orbiting aroundThe Caraval, Legendand theactorswas nonchalantly mentioned. Perhaps it was intentional and some of the questions will be answered and clarified in the next books in the series but, for me, the way the folklore wasn‚Äôt sufficiently distilled through the chapters to offer a perfect understanding of the magical world made it difficult to go through the story, therefore I didn‚Äôt feel completely connected to either the storyline nor the characters.""Legend‚Äôs special guest had made Scarlett feel privileged.

I also felt an inexplicable need to share a few sentences on why I loved this book, so here we go!THE WRITING Fairytale books (books written in that style) turn into fairytale attempts usually by page 3-4. But this WHOLE BOOK is a giant fairytale from start to finish. It's hard to keep the vibes going, but Stephanie Garber managed to do just that. I know that these books are very popular, and just that usually gives books a bad rep. Why, it's simple, it's either that so many people are trying to shove the book down your throath or they don't market it very well. Let me tell you, I've seen countless drawings of the characters, quotes, beautiful covers and special editions, but not a single soul told me HOW WELL THIS WAS WRITTEN. I'm a huge sucker for a good writing style, and the way a book is worded heavily affects my rating! I read this on my Kindle so I didn't tab anything and there wasn't much that was quote-worthy, but just like I noticed with Divine Rivals, every single sentence was thought through, well phrased, comparisons were beautiful. The writing gave the whole book a mystical magical aesthetic. I wouldn't really say that typical fairytale phrases were present (or I haven't noticed them), but the VIBE was there (and I'm all about vibes).THE PLOT just kept going. Since this book came out in 2016 (THAT'S CRAZY), tell me, what would you expect? Personally, I would expect three things: 1. a teenage girl who needs to save the world 2. a love triangle 3. our FMC falling in love with an evil mastermind. NO, NO AND NO! This book was none of that! It was twisty, it was unpredictable, the plot shifted every 2 pages, I was going insane in the updates (I'm sorry for my terrible theories guys). There were so many plot points and I DIDN'T GUESS A SINGLE ONE CORRECTLY! It looks like I love to be a fool since I loved this book!THE ROMANCE was present here and there, we did admire all these hot men Scarlett stumbled upon (even though we never really knew their true identities). But they were all dark-haired, SO DON'T BLAME ME IF I FOLDED. The romance aspect of this also wasn't very prominent and it didn't drive the plot that much. So, that part was short and sweet, it was done right, and I can't complain!THE CHARACTERS Breaking my silence, I found all of them annoying in the beginning (Scarlett, Tella, Julian). They were very typical-insufferable-YA-lead coded those first 50 pages, but then BOOM, I fell in love with all of them and rooted for their happy ending! I wouldn't say that Stephanie Garber put an emphasis on her characters, like I said, this book was very prominently plot-driven and that's something that surprised me. I'm usually a fan of character-driven stories and those tend to be my favorites (or highly rated books), so, if I find the characters not character-ing, or let's say, lacking, the book doesn't get a high rating from me. I still wish we got more juice-of-your-soul typa content from our protagonists, but they were running around through the entirety of this book, so not much time for trauma dumping, I guess.THE WARDROBE I've recently seen a video talking about how readers don't really care what a character is wearing and it was basically a plea to authors not to include thorough physical descriptions of characters and I pretty much agreed with the creator of that video at the time. This book has done that, and tbh, overdone it, BUT IT WAS JUST WHAT I NEEDED. I ate up every single description of every single outfit these circus lunatics were wearing, STEPHANIE YOU'RE A GENIUS (i wanna go to fashion school).That's it for this review, I'm ready for this author to ruin me forever! üíñüíñ""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""This wasHIGHLYentertaining!!!

Just miss me with that shit. Miss me with it all the way.Back in the day, when I was a snarky teenager, I used to enjoy writing reviews that were really, really, venomous. Kids can be cruel, and while I stand by my right to love or hate any media, and to express my opinion, it can go...a little far. Then again, hyperbole is hyperbole. When, at seventeen, I went around saying that a book was so bad it gave me measles, you might want to take that with a pinch of salt, and also for its obvious comedic value. People are more than welcome to get irate about my reviews - they often do, bless them - but at the end of the day, books are books, a form of entertainment. It\'s not life or fucking death, guys. I don\'t think a cheeky sarcastic review is going to stop any author from paying their bills and nor is it going to bar anyone else from enjoying the book.These days, I\'m still not one to hold back, but one woman\'s trash is another\'s treasure. Everybody likes things for different reasons. It\'s also a testament to how my writing has improved that I no longer write critiques like an angry goth whose elders don\'t ""get her vibe"". I like to think that I write now with the same energy and aesthetic as a French person saying ""bof"" if you ask them how their meal was at the Hard Rock Cafe.I\'m saying this because as a teenager, before the Terrible Twenties swept over my home like a harbinger of end times, a wicked power that even the lamb\'s blood smeared over the threshold of my door could not ward off, I would have torn this book a new one. But now, all I can do is look at it, sigh, and say, ""Well, at least that\'s over.""Okay, listen. I have read worse books. But I don\'t think that\'s a compliment, is it? This was just so tired, so expected, so flat. The last twenty percent of this was completely unintelligible, and maybe I could have forgiven it this- all of this nonsense with people coming back to life and a stupidly elaborate plan just to get Tella and Scarlett away from their father when they could have just stabbed him in his sleep, all of the bullshit that everyone put Scarlett through that she fucking forgave them for, and the fact that this whole thing was just one big humiliating runaround for Scarlett that accomplished absolutely nothing since their father still knows Scarlett is alive and could still come after her -if the characters had not been unbearably flat. It was so difficult to care about anything because the essential emotional thread of the story just didn\'t exist.Julian is a horrible fucking liar, Tella is a manipulative arsehole, and Scarlett is so painfully gullible, and you might think that this could make them interesting, but it doesn\'t - they\'re all painted in such a positive light, everything they do justified, and I would have preferred a cast full of villains to this.And on paper, you might think it\'s clever and exciting that it all turns out to be an elaborate game, but the whole thing is so shoddily cobbled together, so nonsensical, that it just feels like reaching. This whole book is just reaching, basically.Frankly, this book reads like an early draft that need a lot of polishing. It\'s all over the place, and I can\'t invest myself in that sort of story, where I can feel every move the author was making. It\'s so difficult to get on board with a book that\'s written that way. Because youcanfeel every move the author made, or rather, every misstep. It feels rushed and messy, lazily plotted, poorly paced.But these are serious, fundamental problems with the story structure itself. The whole premise is a problem, because it just doesn\'t make any sense why any of this is happening, and it makes even less sense the further you go. It is actually shocking to me how shoddy it is.Take it back to the drawing board; invest some more time in it. The very bare bones of this story could potentially be interesting, and I do like the idea of the circus (kind of. Not really. I\'m just trying to be nice here). With a few massive rounds of editing it could have been something cool. But as it is, it\'s sort of a wreck. The kicker with the prose is that I see what the author was trying to do: magical writing for a story about magic. But there is no magic here. And it wouldn\'t matter what sort of book this was, what the story was about, because writing like this never works. This book is badly written and there is nothing else I can say about this, except to deliver some examples, because it has to be seen to be believed.""Every touch created colors she had never seen. Colors as soft as velvet and as sharp as sparks that turned into stars.""what""Tella loved danger the same way candlewicks loved to burn.""the""She remembered his rows of sharply defined brown muscles.""actual""Fierce as a kitten who\'d just gotten claws, willing to shred the whole world to make this right.""fuck""Shades of the rich ruby love she\'d felt during the game mixed with hues of deep-indigo hurt, turning everything just a little bit violet.""is""Scarlett wanted to melt into the night, wink out of existence like a broken star.""this""Tella beamed, brighter than candlelight and glass-cut glitter""???That\'s a good question, isn\'t it? I\'ll leave you to ponder it.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'I had really high hopes forCaraval. The blurb, the cover, and the excellent reviews promised a magical whirlwind of a story. And this novel delivered that, but its relatively achieved grandeur was overshadowed bit by bit till the end. The last 50 pages or so of the book took its soul out, leaving me with a bittersweet aftertaste, a headache and lots of confusion.Since I cannot even reflect upon the messy thoughts inside my brain, I\'ll analyze punctually.1. The world-building.Sadly, in its true meaning and ramifications, we have no such thing as world-building. I do not even know how to categorize this novel. High-fantasy? Just fantasy? Regardless, in the beginning we had mentions of empires and conquered isles which had me utterly excited, but they were left to rot in the backseat so that the world of Caraval could unravel. Moving to this microcosm, it was indeed complex and fascinating. However, only through its captivating appearance and bold imagery and creative ideas. If you dive deeper, into the background, mechanisms and history, you come up empty. It\'s all really a facade.2. The plot.God, the lies. There were so many lies and so many secrets and so many games and manipulation that it honestly ended up being exhausting. Revelations upon revelations, ones that often contradict each other, keep you guessing from start to finish, but after a while this initially mesmerizing stance metamorphoses into the feel of being tricked. Personally, that\'s how I felt. Deceived. After all the puzzle pieces finally straightforwardly fell into place (some that I\'ve anticipated, some that I did not) you are offered an explanation. And like all good magic tricks, this kills the spirit -- and, implicitly, the so called ""plot"" -- of Caraval. Gone is the magic and wonder; instead, the triviality and over-the-top drama take residence. It\'s a scam. A ploy. And, much like Scarlett felt in last key-scenes, I also felt I haven\'t really made progress in the story.3. The characters.We have Scarlett, our heroine; Julian, the love-interest; Donatella, the sister. Governor Dragna, the father and also the villain. Legend, the pseudo villain and the mastermind behind Caraval. Plus a few secondary, yet admirable characters (them I liked in their entirety). Scarlett could have been awesome, I\'m telling you, if it weren\'t for her constant fretting and worrying and flowery thinking. Her personality was nuanced only in the kind, moral and brave spectrum, but at least a fraction of character development existed. Julian is a completely other story. The hottie and protective type, he was so intricately woven into the scam I\'ve mentioned that he missed becoming a swoony book boyfriend. Tella was, on the other hand, funky and with a mind of her own, but her supposed cleverness the author tries to sell us falls flat. Despite their flaws, the sisters had a nice relationship. Their father represents a villain-wannabe that should only be called as he truly is -- an abuser, a bully. Legend... now Legend was a mystery and I\'d love to find out more. The epilogue seems to hint we\'ll see him again in a sharper focus.4. The romance.A bit too syrupy and insta-love reminiscing. I realize now it\'s the same feeling I\'ve had when readingFalling Kingdoms: it\'s too much, too early in too little pages. About a quarter into the book, the feelings developed by Scarlett for Julian were already getting in the way of the plot. And I am quite the romantic fan girl, so when I\'m saying something felt off, I\'m not doing it lightly. Taking into account the amount of untruths that they based their relationship on, it\'s yet again a case of a shaky foundation to a central aspect of the book.5. The writing style.Expect prose the likes of Laini Taylor. It sounds beautiful and I\'ll admit I get swept away pretty easily with this type of writing. It felt like the story flowed, despite its numerous hiccups. The third-person narrative also helped induce a darker atmosphere to keep us on the edge. On a structural level, there was redundancy, but I managed to overlook it gradually. Overall, I\'ll keep an eye out for Stephanie Garber, because this debut certifies she has storytelling skills.Even thoughCaravalhas been pitched asThe Night Circusin different and refreshing clothing, it is far from the lovely and slow-burning tale of Celia and Marco. Nonetheless, I wholeheartedly believe it deserves at least a skimming. It\'s an enigmatic story from start to finish and the epilogue assured I\'ll read the sequel. Color me intrigued.ENJOY! <3'}]"

Lohnt nicht, da die Ida aus dem zweiten Teil nichts, aber auch gar nichts, mit der detailreichen, tiefgr√ºndigen, und stets bedachten Ida aus dem ersten Band zu tun hat. Auch deren vorherige Eloquenz muss gelitten haben, da nun ihr (gr√∂√ütenteils englischsprachiger) Wortschatz anscheinend nur noch Adjektive mit dem Prefix ‚Äûschei√ü-‚Äú kennt.

Man bekommt als Leser davon nie was zu sehen und auch der Kontakt zu Tilda (der vorher ihr Lebenselixier war) bricht vollst√§ndig ab und diese kommt gar nicht mehr wirklich vor. Ida hat absolut keine Pers√∂nlichkeitsmerkmale au√üer Rauchen, Drogen, exorbitanter Verwendung von Anglizismen (und wenn ich das sage, muss es wirklich zu viel sein) und erf√§hrt 1:1 die exakt identische Liebesgeschichte wie Tilda in Buch 1. Man wei√ü von Seite 1 an, mit wem sie zusammen kommt, man hat dieses Mal den stylischen St√ºssy-Tr√§ger statt Carhartt-Enthusiasten (Buch 1) der offensichtlich Range Rover f√§hrt und nat√ºrlich weltbekannter DJ ist (aber auf R√ºgen lebt und nicht arbeiten muss). Dieses gesamte Marken-Erw√§hnen hat mich schier wahnsinnig gemacht. Es ist keine Windjacke, es ist eine Helly-Hansen-Jacke. Er tr√§gt nicht einmal sondern hundertmal Carhartt und St√ºssy (und nat√ºrlich wei√ü ich genau welcher Typ Mann damit gemeint ist, vermutlich der Typ Mann der der Autorin zusagt) und sie kuschelt sich nicht in seinen Pullover sondern in seinen St√ºssy-Pullover. H√§? In welcher Welt ist das jetzt relevant f√ºr mich? Warum wird dieser Schwerpunkt gesetzt? Es zerst√∂rt eher die Barriere die man zur echten Welt aufbauen m√∂chte, indem man liest - zumindest tut es das, wenn es derart extrem verwendet wird. Es ist so unn√∂tig dieses berlinerische Branding zu betreiben und damit auch alle Klischees zu bedienen; sei es mit den Drogen oder der Sprache, die wirklich verhindert, dass dieses Buch generations√ºbergreifend gelesen werden kann (und das sage ich als Gen-Z, die so spricht aber deswegen nicht auch so lesen m√∂chte). Mit W√∂rtern wie ""creepy"", ""aka"" (statt alias), ""rant"", ""checken"" (sag doch einfach mal verstehen), ""chill mal"" u. √Ñ. verbaut sich die Autorin auch eine Menge potentielles Publikum und schw√§cht ihre Eloquenz und ihr Ausdrucksverm√∂gen bzw. die Qualit√§t dessen. Die gesamte Sprache hat unter dem Drang, sie m√∂glichst aktuell zu gestalten, gelitten. Mein pers√∂nliches Highlight: Die Tasten meines MacBooks br√ºllten mich an. Heidewitzka. Ich k√∂nnte noch seitenweise weiter ‚Äûranten"" so unangenehm war dieses Buch geschrieben und so weit entfernt vom ersten Teil hat es sich befunden. Ich glaube die Autorin hat wirklich alle Klischees die sie ja auch selbst erf√ºllt (Mikropony - dieses verspottet sie ja auch in Teil 1 - Literatur in Berlin, Drogen etc.) in Ida gesteckt und sich absolut keine Gedanken mehr zu der vorhergehenden Charakterkonstruktion gemacht. Weder Mariannes Geschichte wird aufgekl√§rt (und ihre Erkrankung f√ºgt absolut nichts aber auch gar nichts zur Geschichte bei), noch gibt es eine Konfliktl√∂sung mit Tilda oder ein aufkl√§rendes Moment mit der Mutter ... letztendlich bezieht sich alles auf Leif (so hei√üt der Range Rover-fahrende DJ, kein Witz) der nat√ºrlich mal wieder der rettende Prinz ist, genau wie zuvor Viktor bei Tilda, die keinerlei Rettung ben√∂tigte. Die weiblichen Hauptcharaktere werden damit so geschw√§cht und die eigentliche Story zu reduziert, wenn die Aufl√∂sung immer der Kerl ist. Dass auch die Liebesgeschichte exakt identisch war wirkte einfach nur faul und repetitiv. Ich habe mich (durch die einfache Sprache sehr schnell) durch dieses zusammenhangslose Werk gequ√§lt und kann nicht glauben wie so etwas ver√∂ffentlicht werden konnte. Zuletzt hat sie sich √†-la Sally Rooney (die ich mag) auch von diversen Satzzeichen verabschiedet, was leider die enorm hohe Quote an ‚ÄûIch‚Äú-Satzanf√§ngen nur noch mehr unterstrichen hat. Sie hatte noch teilweise ihre Momente mit tollen S√§tzen, diese waren jedoch in Teil 1 viel h√§ufiger zu finden und der Satzbau hat mich besondere Beschreibungen vermissen lassen. So vieles wurde aufgebaut ohne dem nachzugehen: Wozu die Storyline mit Leifs Opa? Wozu (den carhartt-tragenden) Jasper und Mandys eisige Art? Was steckte dahinter? Alles, was endlich mal Tiefgang geboten h√§tte, wurde nicht weiter verfolgt; stattdessen wurden lieber seitenweise Klamotten beschrieben oder lyrische Versuche oder Gedankeng√§nge gestartet, die leider eher banal als neu oder interessant waren. Am meisten Pers√∂nlichkeit hatte zuletzt Knut, alles andere waren oberfl√§chliche Figuren. Wirkt alles sehr √ºberst√ºrzt, mit wenig Tiefgang, und zu gewollt ‚Äûquirky‚Äú.

Immer am Handy, diese Generation.Caroline Wahl schreibt unverbl√ºmt, direkte, in Jungsprech, aber so konsequent und vehement, dass die Einfachheit, Schnellheit, Ungek√ºnsteltheit N√§he zur Figur erzeugt, authentische Szenen erleben l√§sst, die hier und da in den Kitsch prallen, aber nur umso schneller wieder Fahrt aufzunehmen, hin in eine Richtung, in der nicht alles Schrott, kaputt, tot ist. Ida tr√§gt ihr Los bemerkenswert. Dass sie lamentiert, versteht sich von selbst. Sie hat viele Gr√ºnde zu lamentieren.

Und habe sie gehen lassen.Wie unfertig, rabiat, obsz√∂n und kurz-stenosprachlich auch immer, die Wut tr√§gt den Text, Ida intensiviert die Zeilen, das Auf und Ab rechtfertigt sich von selbst. Es gibt direkte Rede in Anf√ºhrungszeichen und direkte Rede ohne Anf√ºhrungszeichen. Die Symbolik verliert sich im Ungef√§hren. Die Sprache dampft sich zu einem Sparringpartner ein. Sie haut auf die Tasten, sp√ºrbar, denn zwischen sich und ihrer Welt bleibt eine L√ºcke. Sie sieht sich, entfernt. Sie beobachtet sich, durch eine Panzerglaswand hindurch:Wir schauen uns dabei an, und keiner weicht dem Blick des anderen aus, Blickhalten scheint Teil des Fragespiels zu sein.

Es ist immer noch ein guter Roman, auch wenn er einige Schw√§chen hat.Statt Tilda steht diesmal Ida im Mittelpunkt.

Statt zu Tilda f√§hrt sie an die Ostsee. Auf R√ºgen lernt sie Leif, Knut und Marianne kennen. Ida muss den Tod ihrer ehemals alkoholkranken Mutter verarbeiten und zu sich selbst finden.Im Vergleich zu ""Paradise Garden"" von Elena Fischer, bei dem auch die Verarbeitung des Todes der Mutter im Mittelpunkt steht, werden die Schw√§chen von ""Windst√§rke 17"" deutlich. Durch die Schwere des Ereignisses entsteht bei Letzterem im Gegensatz zu Ersterem eine starke Beh√§bigkeit in der Erz√§hlung. Das ist vielleicht das k√ºnstlerische Konzept. An einer Stelle ist von ""einer unheilvollen, komischen Schwere in der Luft"" die Rede. Das erreicht mich leider nicht immer. Erst in Teil 4 gibt es eine Wendung, die auch mich schlie√ülich in G√§nze kriegt.Fehler wie beispielsweise die Aussage, dass Leif f√ºr die Spex schreibt, die zum Zeitpunkt der Handlung l√§ngst eingestellt war, haben mich irritiert und aus der Geschichte rausgebracht. Hier w√§re ein besseres Lektorat hilfreich gewesen. Auch sprachlich gibt es diesmal einige holprige Stellen, die man leicht h√§tte bereinigen k√∂nnen.Die Atmosph√§re mit viel Wald- und Meeresluft und einsilbiger Begr√º√üung mit ""Moin"" hat mir aber gut gefallen. Auch das letzte Viertel, in dem es noch einmal zu einer Wendung kommt, die f√ºr Ida unbewusst mit dem Tod der Mutter zusammenh√§ngt und ihr eine Chance auf Wiedergutmachung gibt, war dann wieder sehr √ºberzeugend.

Ich liebe ihre direkte, klare, poetische und pr√§gnante Schreibweise und ihren episodenhaften Erz√§hlstil.Allerdings bleiben damit f√ºr mich auch die emotionalen Bindungen der Charaktere zueinander und deren Entwicklung etwas zu blass und stereotyp. Idas Geschichte pl√§tschert ohne wirkliche H√∂hen und Tiefen oder Spannungsbogen vor sich hin.Dennoch ist das Buch meiner Meinung nach aber schon aufgrund Caroline Wahls Umgang mit Worten absolut lesenswert und gibt einen Einblick in Idas Leben gepr√§gt von Trauer, Schuld, Gewissensbissen und Einsamkeit (aber auch Hoffnung, Verbundenheit und Zugeh√∂rigkeit).Einen nachhaltigen Eindruck wird es aber bei mir aber wohl leider nicht hinterlassen.3.5'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Caroline Wahls Lieblingsverben sind eindeutig ""br√ºllen"" und ""schreien"".Wer hat dieses Buch bitte redigiert?

Die Angst war unbegr√ºndet, es war wieder tolltolltoll und so richtig sch√∂n zum reinsinken und genau das richtige Wiedersehen mit Tilda, Ida und Viktor. Der Schreibstil von Caro Wahl war wieder mal *chefs kiss* und hoffe ein bisschen, dass sie mir einfach ab jetzt jedes Jahr (m)ein Sommerbuch liefert (#nopressure)Was (mich) nat√ºrlich bei einem Nachfolger sehr besch√§ftigt (und hier auch schon diskutiert wurde) ist die Frage: Welches Buch war denn nun besser, ‚Äú22 Bahnen‚Äù oder ‚ÄúWindst√§rke 17‚Äù? Ich hab lange dr√ºber nachgedacht und glaube, ich fand den Plot von ‚Äú22 Bahnen‚Äù st√§rker, aber Ida mochte ich als Protagonistin mehr, vielleicht, weil sie mit ihrer Wut im Bauch ‚Äún√§her an mir dran‚Äù ist (?).

Diese beiden Norddeutschen nehmen Ida - typisch nordisch eben ü§ç - ohne viele Fragen zu stellen auf und ganz langsam lernt Ida, das Leben wieder zu sch√§tzen. Und w√§hrend Ida sich mit ihrer Wut, Trauer, Verlust, Vertrauen, F√ºrsorge, Schreibblockade und vielen alten und neuen Gedanken und Erlebnissen auseinandersetzen muss, isst sie Botinchen, Eszet-Br√∂tchen oder K√§sekuchen mit Marianne, wirft sich in die Ostsee und k√§mpft gegen die Wellen und vor allem sich selbst an üåä, spielt Elfer-Raus & Phase10 & UNO mit Leif und Marianne und verliebt sich.¬ªMarianne: Ida, du bist so eine schlechte Verliererin.

Steile These von mir: Egal, was Caro mit ihrem unverwechselbaren Sound aus wahnsinnig feiner Beobachtungs(-wieder-)gabe, Humor, Ironie, Ehrlichkeit und Stil schreibt, ich werde es lesen und lieben. ‚ù§Ô∏è\u200düî•¬ªWir schwimmen ins offene Meer, ich tauche so tief, bis es wehtut, und meine, beim tiefsten Punkt kurz seine Hand √ºber mein Bein streichen zu sp√ºren, √§rgere mich √ºber meinen K√∂rper, der umgehend eine neue Ber√ºhrung will, die nicht kommt, und begreife irgendwie, dass es wahrscheinlich immer so sein wird mit ihm.

Und das ergibt einfach ein wahnsinnig gutes Buch.¬ªEs riecht nach Herbst, obwohl es noch nicht Herbst ist, und es weht eine schwache Brise, drei Windst√§rken sch√§tze ich.

Exakt der richtige Mix aus R√ºckbez√ºgen auf das Deb√ºt. ü•π'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '""Windst√§rke 17"" pr√§sentiert eine d√ºstere Fortsetzung zu ‚Äû22 Bahnen‚Äú, die die Leserinnen und Lesern auf eine emotionale Achterbahnfahrt mitnimmt. Im Mittelpunkt des Romans steht dieses Mal Protagonistin Ida. Es sind Jahre vergangen, seit Tilda Ida mit der alkoholkranken Mutter allein zu Hause gelassen hat. Ida hat sich durchgeschlagen, aber der Selbstmord der Mutter, als sie nicht zu Hause ist, wirft sie vollkommen aus der Bahn. Spontan fl√ºchtet sie nach R√ºgen und lernt dort das √§ltere Ehepaar Marianne und Knut kennen, bei denen sie Stabilit√§t und W√§rme findet. Zus√§tzlich ist da noch Leif, dem sie ebenfalls n√§her kommt und der seine eigenen P√§ckchen zu tragen hat. Doch dann erh√§lt Marianne eine Krebsdiagnose und Ida muss sich dem Umgang mit Angst, N√§he und m√∂glichem Verlust stellen.Die Sprache von Autorin Caroline Wahl hat mir erneut richtig gut gefallen, sie findet poetische und treffende Metaphern f√ºr Idas Gef√ºhle und die Geschichte entfaltet schnell einen Sog. Dieses Mal ist nicht das Freibad der R√ºckzugsort, sondern die mal als ruhig, mal als st√ºrmisch beschriebene Ostsee, was mir ebenfalls gut gefallen hat. Ich bin aber unsicher, ob ich den Roman wirklich h√§tte lesen wollen, wenn ich gewusst h√§tte, dass Mariannes Krebserkrankung so eine gro√üe Rolle spielen w√ºrde. Im Vergleich mit 22 Bahnen hat dieses Buch inhaltlich deutlich weniger Leichtigkeit und Hoffnung zu bieten. Am Ende bleibt Vieles offen und auch das Verh√§ltnis zwischen den beiden Schwestern Ida und Tilda bleibt ungekl√§rt, da Ida ihre Wut auf Tilda selbst nicht n√§her bestimmen kann.Insgesamt bietet ""Windst√§rke 17"" eine tiefgr√ºndige Reflexion √ºber Verlust, Angst und die Suche nach Stabilit√§t. Wer sich auf eine emotionale Herausforderung einlassen m√∂chte und Caroline Wahls poetische Sprache sch√§tzt, sollte einen Blick riskieren, aber Vorsicht walten lassen, denn dieser Roman ist keine leichte Kost.'}]"

And still haven‚Äôt told their best friends.Which is how they find themselves sharing the largest bedroom at the Maine cottage that has been their friend group‚Äôs yearly getaway for the last decade. Their annual respite from the world, where for one vibrant, blue week they leave behind their daily lives; have copious amounts of cheese, wine, and seafood; and soak up the salty coastal air with the people who understand them most.Only this year, Harriet and Wyn are lying through their teeth while trying not to notice how desperately they still want each other. Because the cottage is for sale and this is the last week they‚Äôll all have together in this place. They can‚Äôt stand to break their friends‚Äô hearts, and so they‚Äôll play their parts. Harriet will be the driven surgical resident who never starts a fight, and Wyn will be the laid-back charmer who never lets the cracks show. It‚Äôs a flawless plan (if you look at it from a great distance and through a pair of sunscreen-smeared sunglasses). After years of being in love, how hard can it be to fake it for one week‚Ä¶ in front of those who know you best?A couple who broke up months ago make a pact to pretend to still be together for their annual weeklong vacation with their best friends in this glittering and wise new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Emily Henry.","[{'rating': 4, 'content': '‚û∏4.25 stars‚Äùin every universe, it‚Äôs you for me.even if it‚Äôs not me for you.‚Äù‚Äî alexa, play maroon by taylor swift.can‚Äôt believe emily henry had the audacity to write a book about me!!

we also become immersed in wyn and harriet‚Äôs past relationship and we are taken back to how they first met and fell in love.the past chapters are shown to be harriet‚Äôs ‚Äúhappy place‚Äù which is when her time is spent at a cottage in maine ‚Äî an annual trip she takes with her boyfriend and best friends.‚Äùyou are in all of my happiest places. you are where my mind goes when it needs to be soothed.‚Äù‚Äî second chance romance trope is honestly one of my favourite tropes, but only when it‚Äôs done well. i need to feel the connection between both characters, what made them fall apart and their journey finding their way back to each other, and i can say this book excelled at that. this book had me feeling all the feels. literally the PINING in this omg and the ANGSTTT and the pain, my poor lil heart couldn‚Äôt take it all. wyn and harriet were so torn up over each other, but they are so bad at communicating their vulnerability to one another. the chemistry between them is palpable despite the fact they‚Äôre not together anymore.PSA: this book relies heavily on past miscommunication/lack of communication so if you‚Äôre a miscommunication hater like me, be aware. these two are so broken and damaged, i couldn‚Äôt hate on it. harriet has a tendency to push everyone away, including wyn; and wyn has a tendency to worry and overthink things‚Äîwhich in time ended up clashing together but it was handled so immaculately, i found it bearable and i just wanted to see them both get their happy ending.‚û≥harriet kilpatrick:harriet is me, i am her. she puts other peoples needs and feelings before her own to keep the peace. the way she has an inability to show others her emotions, especially during the break up bc she fears she will be a burden really hit close to home. her character was frustrating at times, but nonetheless she was so loveable and understandable bc her upbringing and family dynamic affected her as she grew up. she was never taught how to fight with the ones she loves and that took a toll on the way she communicates in relationships. but i just constantly wanted to grab her by the shoulders, shake her and scream ‚ÄúYOU ARE ENOUGH‚Äù i love her character sm, it was definitely bc i related to her in an unnerving way *cough*i also hate my job.her love for wyn was devastatingly beautiful, the way she loves and feels is so deep.‚û≥wyn connor:wyn, wyn, wyn, oh how i love u. when his love language is physical touch ü§≠ i died at that. my soul left my body and descended to heaven, not even joking- he‚Äôs my baby boy fr. we see his character as very self conscious and never believes in himself, we can see that he feels he is not enough for harriet and his self doubt instincts always take over but he loves HARD. on that topic; i didn‚Äôt understand how he can love so hard, but walk away so quickly without fighting for harriet, but it makes sense since they‚Äôre so bad at communicating ü•≤‚Äî ms henry wrote another swoon-worthy character who is deeply flawed but loveable at the same time. i just love the way EH handles mental health topics and always manages to give so much emotional depth to her characters.Íí∞wyn and harriet:Íí±i love both of their characters and i was rooting for them the entire book!! the witty banter and sarcasm between them had me giggling fr. you could feel the connection between them both, they are soulmates!! they both ache for each other and you can feel it all pour out of the pages. harriet and wyn are so different from each other‚Äîyet so similar, this is why they instantly connected with one another. i just love how EH made their conflict realistic and not forced and dragged out. we see them both focus on their self-growth and healing, but seeing harriet go through her self-discovery journey and then finding her way back to wyn has me in my feels rn, it just felt so real. ü•π‚Äúi thought i made you [‚Ä¶] just by wishing.‚Äù‚û∑ the friendships and connections in this book is so strong, but it also tackles how friendships can change over time as adult friendships can become so difficult to maintain as you age with everyone being in different stages in their life. i loved seeing this group navigate through it all, i crave a friendship like what they all have even though it‚Äôs dysfunctional and the conflict would be over lack of communication was juvenile but it made it feel so much more real. my main take from this was thatfriendships are love stories too. i just love platonic love!! also, the theme of found family runs so deep in this story, she executed it so perfectly >>>‚Äî overall, this book was phenomenal and i absolutely adored it, EH writing is just *chefs kiss* if you‚Äôre looking for a romance galore book i‚Äôm sorry to say this book isn‚Äôt for you, this book explores more about a friend group and their dynamics, growing up and letting go. i will keep saying, HER BOOKS ARE 100% MORE WOMEN‚ÄôS FICTION, THE ROMANCE IS JUST A PLUS!!‚Äî but, i wasn‚Äôt a fan of the ending honestly.. it was really rushed and it didn‚Äôt fit harriet‚Äôs character; the decision she made fr left me shocked lmao. she threw all that away for a hobby, in this economy?? girl- üò≥üßçüèª\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄdamn, she got me again!!

I wish that could be me! <3My review may contain some spoilers, you\'ve been warned.I decided to give Emily Henry another chance afterBeach Read,which I did not finish because it was bad in my opinion. So, I said ""Why not? Maybe this one turns out to be pretty good!"" and now that I finished it,I\'ve realized(after a long night of overthinking and self-loathing. Yeah, I know, it wasn\'t my best night, lol)that maybe romance as a main plot isn\'t my genre.First of all, I\'ve never ever been in love in my almost 25 years of miserable existence, nor someone has been in love with me, so I don\'t actually know how it really feels, (that\'s a deep and traumatic conversation for another day), but to me it\'s kind of unreal that people can last years and not get bored. Please, don\'t get me wrong, I\'m not saying it\'s not a real thing , but I can\'t even start to imagine someone loving me for so long without getting bored of me.(Plot twist: deep down, I\'m a hopeless romantic who yearns to love and be loved for a really long time and to be in a healthy relationship, but that\'s not gonna happen, so).Basically, Happy Place is about a second chance romance, between Harriet and Wyn (I swear I\'ve never heard the name Wyndham until the day I started this book), who broke up five months ago and reunite for a trip with their best friends. They have to act like they\'re still together and pretend happiness and such just to not causing chaos.The jump from past to present was not for me. While I enjoy those kind of flashbacks, things were ""interesting"" in the present than in the past.I felt like a fucking third wheel.Or perhaps like I was in the middle of a friend group which I wasn\'t part of and it made me feel uncomfortable, (I\'ve felt like that in the past, in many friend groups, and it feels awful) and if EH\'s point was to make me feel like I belonged with them, well, it didn\'t work out. They didn\'t even feel like best friends because there was a lot of tension and they were keeping secrets from each other (yes, I know this last thing happens a lot irl).The side characters had no personality whatsoever. They felt very flat and boring. Sabrina was controlling and kind of bitchy. Parth had zero personality. Cleo and Kimmy were okay, until I felt like they were not a lesbian couple, but a heterosexual couple where one of them is a guy with a girl\'s name. Don\'t come at me for this, I just felt it like that. Ididenjoy when Sabrina was called out. I get that they were in that trip mourning their youth and trying to have a good time, but goddamn it waspainful.I just could not stand them. Trust me, I\'m good at mourning my wasted and non existent youth, but this was pure hell.Wyn was flat and boring. Gods,he had no personalityand it was pretty clear.Even a shoe or a rock has more personality than Wyn Connor.What I hated the most is that basically Harriet was the one making the moves. Always. Man, if you really ""love her"" then go and fucking fight for her. MAKE SOME GODDAMN MOVES TO GET HER BACK AND LOVE HER PROPERLY.And Harriet, girly pop, please, have a little bit more of self-steem and respect for yourself. Stop being a people pleaser and try to save everyone. !I hate miscommunication.I believe it\'s one of the worst tropes ever and it\'s used throughout the book. Harriet complains and whines a lot, has a lot of inner monologuesbut she never says shit.Ma\'am, please don\'t expect that everyone knows what the hell do you want if you never say anything. I\'m not defending Wyn either, because he did the same thing. And they were constantly lying about how they were happy and okay. Both, Harriet and Wyn made a lot of assumptions instead of actually talk to each other, which could have spared us from a 400 pages book. Things could have solved up faster if they both had spoken first.Like, are you going to tell me that after a long-ass relationship of 8 YEARS, neither of you can communicate things?They could have broken up sooner if they just talked things through. It\'s like both communication and understanding were missing in the entire book. Also, breaking up with her over the phone? Are you fucking kidding me?This book could have been better if we had Wyn\'s POV. He obviously was struggling with depression, the loss of his father and his mother being diagnosed with Parkinson. We could have understood him more like this. But otherwise, he seemed indifferent about his relationship.My last straw was... Pottery? Really?Did you just throw so many years of med school, hard work and your residency for pottery? I don\'t know how things work for med school in the u.s, but, girly pop, I\'m pretty sure that isn\'t cheap, not even when you study in a good school. And holy shit, she‚Äôs a neurosurgery resident.(My dream was to become a neurosurgeon, so I was speechless and almost screaming like Regina George in Mean Girls). I\'m still speachless and amazed because how are you gonna pay your +$200,000 debts from pottery? Wyn must be a fucking billionare.I also felt nothing, nor empathy, sadness, pity or whatever towardsanyof these characters or their problems and relationships.The sex scene felt... Off. There was ""a lot"" of tension going on between Harriet and Wyn from the beginning, but when the sex scene finally came, it disappeared and felt dull.Anyways, not everything seems bad, lmao.I have this love/hate relationship with EH\'s writing style. For one side, there are some phrases where you can relate and say ""Same, sis, same."", but for the other side, Emily uses metaphors and stuff like that where is no needed.The only good thing, perhaps?I get the hype over Emily Henry\'s books, I swear I do, but they never captivate me or make me giggle, kick my feet in the air or feel happy. Maybe there\'s something wrong with me. Maybe, like I said at the beginning of this review, maybe romance as a main is not for me.I\'m not going to include this book in my big hype big lie shelfyetbecause I honestly didn\'t have many expectations for Happy Place.Nevermind, I just added to my big hipe, big lie shelf, lmao.This is where Emily Henry and I part ways.I guess I have more things to say, but I\'ll add them when I remember, lmao.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'I mean... if we are all going to read it....3.5 StarsI know, I know, but before you all come for my head, hear me out.I have never been so conflicted by a book before. I simultaneously really loved and kind of hated this book. Let me start out by saying I think Emily Henry is an absolute poet, she is nothing short of a master at her craft and this book is probably some of her best writing so far. The pacing of this book, the alternating timelines, the character development, the relationships were all beautifully and expertly written. So, you are probably scratching your head thinking, ""Beck, so what was the problem?"" Well........ I just could never buy in to what this whole book is about in the first place, the break-up, let\'s just call it what it is, this is the miscommunication trope on STEROIDS, ""Oh but it was more complicated than that"" WAS IT THOUGH? And if I am being totally honest, I felt like the ending was not enough payoff for the all the emotional trauma we were all put through.Let me start with the things I loved-The writing- Nobody does it like EH. She is an absolute artist with her words, the way she can summon the perfect measure of every emotion into every page is stunning and so rare. I can\'t ignore or deny the absolute magic that this author weaves into every page.""It feels like a moment before a car accident, when the tires have started to hydroplane and you know something terrible is likely coming, but there\'s still a chance the tread will find purchase and you\'ll never know what agony you narrowly avoided.""The chemistry- The chemistry between all her characters is so balanced and always feels authentic. The way her found family move around each other and interact with each other is so natural and genuine. And the chemistry between Wynn and Harriett was off the charts white hot! You could feel the sparks between them jumping off the page, it was palpable.""Maybe I need to know that he remembers that he hasn\'t totally forgotten what it feels like to love me, while I\'m trapped with him buried onto my heart, my, brain, my lungs, my skin.""Harriet- I really loved Harriet. She is entirely relatable; she is riddled with self-doubt and I appreciated her struggle to please those around her and form herself into what she thought the people she loved needed her to be while sacrificing her own wants and desires. I was thrilled for her when she finally started asserting herself and choosing her own path.""I\'m not the brilliant doctor my parents wanted me to be, and I\'m not the person who could give Wyn the happiness he deserves, and I\'m not the friend Sabrina and Cleo needed.""üò≠Ok, what didn\'t work for me:WYNN- Uh oh!! Are you all screaming at me yet? It\'s not what you think, I DO love Wyn, I think he is sweet and charming and vulnerable, and he absolutely loves Harriett, but the man could not muster up the strength to fight for her even ONCE this entire book!! I kept waiting for him to finally grow and fight for Harriet and it just never happens, even at the end it is HARRIET that moves first, it\'s always Harriett. I understand when he was struggling before but by the end he is supposed to be in a better place and it\'s still the same with him. How are we supposed to believe that this relationship will ever last long term, bc things will inevitably get rocky again as do all long-term relationships, but I can\'t believe that he will ever step up, if Harriet doesn\'t hold them together it will fail again. Exibit A down below!!!""You can\'t follow me like I followed you. I won\'t be enough.""""It\'ll get easier, he promises hoarsely, his hand brushing my hair behind my ear. ""Someday you\'ll hardly remember this""See!!! He is literally drowning, and he refuses to kick!!!The Break-Up- More than half of this book is putting us all through this absolute all-consuming agony and heartache for these two people who so obviously deeply love each other and are both completely shattered and heartbroken. The back and forth between the timelines serves to build on this epic love that spans nine years! And the whole time you are thinking, ""What could have possibly happened to tear these two apart?"" And then we finally get there.... and it just didn\'t math for me. Misunderstandings and miscommunication? A four-minute phone call? REALLY? And then just total and complete acceptance? Naaahhhh. I don\'t buy it. Sorry not sorry, it\'s just not believable for me. So, if Sabrina never orchestrated that whole wkend? Then what? They would have just been resigned? It just makes all those beautiful promises that Wyn said to her feel so empty and I think he meant them. Why didn\'t he come find her when he was feeling better and got clarity. Why didn\'t she demand an explanation that she absolutely deserved? And this is just some advice THERAPY is your friend! All of this pain could have so easily been avoided.""I have been in love with her since we met, though,""""No,"" he says quietly. ""In every universe, it\'s you for me. Even if it\'s not me for you.""""If it was possible to stop loving you, I would have managed it in that first year of desperately trying to. I\'m here. For good.""""Do you want me to promise that I will love you forever Harriett? Because I will.""The endingThe woman is a DOCTOR, she could set up a private little practice in Montana and be home for dinner every night. Do you know how much those loans are?

or did their worst fears get in the way of truly unpacking it and instead just tried to bandage it up as quickly as possible to appease one another?wyn‚Äôs constant need to feel loved or feel like he matters, and harriet‚Äôs constant fear that she will make people around her unhappy‚Äîi feel like it will eventually crash and burn again. wyn‚Äôs dad dying was a sort of superficial wound because it was an external circumstance/dent in their relationship. harriet quitting her job (although she was unhappy) also feels like a bit of an over-correction and a bandaid to the true problem.but i disregarded almost all of that during my read because of how much they love each other. it‚Äôs the first romance book i read where i could palpably feel how much and how desperately they love each other‚Äînot in an angsty or sexual way, but just how overwhelmingly they care about each other. and how intrinsically they understand each other (up until the aforementioned part). and also how they try their best to show that love in the way they think the other wants. the way wyn, in flashbacks, always reassures harriet that he will always love her. the way harriet represses all of her immense guilt so she can be the strong one for wyn. small gestures throughout the book that they are always trying to read and understand the other.that made this a very magical read, in a way.‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ªthis was literally AMAZING.i‚Äôll be rereading again & writing a full review in a bit but all you have to know is that this has book lovers‚Äô banter and beach read‚Äôs introspection. not so much a huge rom com like her other books but it‚Äôs much more mature and melancholy and UGH there are some passages i teared up at.5/5 for the moment <3thank you berkley for the arc!!‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ªpre-readEMILY HENRY I WILL HIBERNATE UNTIL APRIL FOR YOU REALLY I SWEAR IT'S NO PROBLEM DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'when this book was first announced ‚Äî before it had a title, or a cover, or a synopsis, or anything other than a weird beige placeholder and the words BY EMILY HENRY stamped on it ‚Äî i made a solemn vow.that vow was this:i would trade my firstborn to read this book. i\'ll locate a baby just to exchange it for this.after i read it twice, i declared it worth it.after the third read, i have good news and i have bad news.the bad news is this might be my least favorite emily henry book.but the good news is that having a least favorite emily henry book is like having a bad slice of pizza, or seeing a just-okay movie in theaters with a big bucket of popcorn and a slushie the size of your head. in other words, even the disappointing experiences are better than most things in this earthly plane.emily henry books are always trying to balance a series of incredible things: a consuming romance; a bantery cast of characters; a charming setting; and an extremely daunting character arc that usually encapsulates a deep dark secret, a fatal flaw, daddy and/or mommy issues, and a shifting career path.this had all of those, like the creation from god it was.

In my opinion, nobody can compete with her because she creates the best of the best. She not only plays the strings of my heart but is also a soul whisperer by writing the most unforgettable love stories.After reading this fantastic angsty romance/self-growth/beautiful friendship story, I decided it is my second favorite book by EH. ""Book Lovers"" is still my all-time favorite novel!I have to admit that this book is the sexiest, steamiest novel the author has written. The main reason is that the couple in the story has already known each other for ten years, and even though they broke up, the flame is still there. They are obviously soulmates! But what happened between Harriet and Wyn? They dated for nearly a decade, staying as fianc√©es for eight years. Why did Wyn end things with a four-minute-long phone call? Was it only long distance, did one of them cheat, or is there any crucial, life-changing reason that tore them apart?Harriet is invited to her Happy Place, where she has spent her most meaningful, unforgettable, sentimental moments with her best friends Sabrina, a hotshot lawyer, and Cleo, an aspiring farmer. Sabrina started dating their long-time friend and party boy Parth, and Cleo is happily farming and dating her hyperactive, extrovert lover Kimmie. Normally, their group turns into a party of five!Even though Harriet broke up with Wyn five months ago, they didn\'t come clean with their friends. Harriet is adamant about telling them at their special union in Happy Place, but she realizes that Sabrina already invited Wyn to their cottage, and Wyn acts like they\'re still together.Harriet finds out that Sabrina\'s father will sell Happy Place, and that this will be their last time together. An era of their lives is about to end. She also gives other shocking news. Harriet is a person who doesn\'t know how to fight, hates conflicts, and tries to please everyone around her. She doesn\'t want to create a disturbance by announcing their break-up, and Wyn seems to be on the same page.They should act like a couple for a week, and they will eventually come clean when their holiday is over. How hard could it be to stay in the same room, touching and kissing your ex in front of others when you are still harboring your unresolved feelings?Overall, this is an inspirational novel about self-growth, friendship, growing up, changing, grief, and mental illness. I returned to read some chapters over and over again. Harriet and Wyn might be my favorite couple that EH has created.Millions of thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing 2023\'s most anticipated book\'s digital copy with me in exchange for my honest review!If you‚Äôre interested in reading my extended book reviews, movie critiques, and hilarious astrology articles, be sure to check out my Medium account using the link below:medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'i feel like me and this book are somehow cosmically intertwined and our souls are one. this book was so taylor swift‚Äôs lover, folklore, midnights coded, tell me i‚Äôm wrong ?!there‚Äôs this unique connection i get from emily henry‚Äôs writing style that at this point should be studied. the way she not only describes feelings but gives me this ache that‚Äôs so deep and penetrating. it‚Äôs so tender omfgthrough out book we are consistently jumping from past to present timelines. and usually flashbacks bore me to no hell but not these. in fact, at some points i was rather craving the flashbacks more than the present moments.harriet and wyn are such unique characters compared to emily‚Äôs other characters. a lot of it is the same i can‚Äôt lie, but still, i get attached to them like glue. they feel so deeply and love so intensely. even though this entire book is all in harriet‚Äôs pov you still get a full characterization of wyn. and not only that. the side characters, this found family. all these characters have so much personality and depth. ugh i‚Äôd take a bullet for all of them fr.harriet is so me coded ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a golden boy. i‚Äôm a girl whose life has been drawn in shades of gray.‚Äù GORL IM CRYINGand wyn omg this sweetheart !! his kindness and selflessness is so precious and infectious. ‚Äúi will always love you, that‚Äôs the point, harriet. it‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs ever come naturally to me.‚Äù GAHHHD i need him !!and as always emily henry books are gonna hit a little harder, linger a little closer, and stay a little longer than any other romance book. 1 star off only because i was semi bored in the middle and it felt a little flat in some parts. and the ending was so fucking rushed. i wished it gradually ended. nonetheless i still really enjoyed this book and highly recommend :)emily henry book rankings (this always changes, although beach read will most likely always stay #1)beach read, pwmov, book lovers, happy placewomen: nora, january, harriet, poppymen: gus, alex, charlie, wynthanks berkeley for the arc'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'unpopular opinion incomingfirst, let me say i am very happy thatso manypeople love this book already.i love that for you, i really do!‚ú®i enjoyed and liked this book,buti didn‚Äôtloveit‚Ä¶ and believe me, i tried.maybe my emotions are broken.maybe ireallydisliked the miscommunication.maybe the entire friend groupslightlyannoyed me.maybe the writing felt pretty average.maybe i went in with my expectations way too high.'}, {'rating': None, 'content': 'Wyn and Harriet are the perfect couple.

AND I DON‚ÄôT CARE WHAT HE SMELLS LIKE ESPECIALLY NOT THE 250TH TIME.it was an active ick for me.wyn.look, he‚Äôs okay. he‚Äôs there. not gonna be there in my memory for long but whatever.in some ways i liked him. but not really anything worth mentioning.he was what this book was: meh.he's the most one-dimensional character in the book.wyn is a sexy lamp.(if you aren‚Äôt aware of what the sexy lamp is, please google it.)not to mention i feel like from what we got to see if their relationship, it was just a lot of:harry: ‚Äúi don‚Äôt deserve you, blah blah blah‚Äùwyn: ‚Äúi‚Äôll love you forever in every universe, blah blah blah‚Äùlike that exact situation happened at least 3 times. that‚Äôs not a lot, but it‚Äôs strange it‚Äôs happened thrice.the friend group/friend dramas/all that shit.i‚Äôm not sure what sense of surprise or whatever was meant to be here, but it was painfully obvious from the beginning that they all had their own shit going on. i gave sabrina the benefit of the doubt, but god she‚Äôs insufferable. i can understand some people needing more control and having that sort of personality quirk - we all have them - but this is an INNATE characteristic in a person andthey either would have run into a problem with it earlier if they had incompatible or clashing personalities for friends, or they would have made different friends.it‚Äôs so stupid that it‚Äôs happening now. and at the same time, i don‚Äôt care.i‚Äôm not going to lie i don‚Äôt really care about cleo either i barely remember anything about her, butkimmy? loml.someone said (i think ale?) in their review that they felt like they were third wheeling this friend group, like they were doing their own thing and as the reader you didn‚Äôt really have a reason to care, and that‚Äôs exactly how i feel!!the setting.hear me out. emily henry has previously had wonderful settings to all her novels, very atmospheric and interesting, and this one felt dull in comparison. it was there ofc, but i‚Äôm not gonna remember it.the ending.girl, please. i know that harry had problems with her job, but throughout the novel she reaffirmed that though it was hard, she enjoyed her job. THEN WHY IS SHE GIVING IT UP TO MOVE ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOR A RELATIONSHIP THAT MIGHT FALL APART AGAIN BECAUSE THEY CAN‚ÄôT FUCKING TALK TO EACH OTHER? the math isn‚Äôt mathing.also, people can have hobbies and passions that exist outside of making money. that‚Äôs a normal healthy thing to do. this is like a larger issue relating to capitalism and triggering my fight or flight but not everything has to be mercenary. that so often ruins passions and it annoys me when so many people do that. why can‚Äôt shorty just like pottery??i‚Äôm sure i forgot something and i‚Äôll definitely come update this but at the end of it i do still love emily henry as an author and i will continue to read whatever she publishes.i love how she creates stories differently with different plots and that the characters are all different and not carbon copies of each other.and as previously mentioned, i‚Äôd propose to her writing style.basically, i‚Äôm pretending my signed copy is of book lovers.------i'm leaving this pre-review bc its gorgeous:this acts as my love letter to emily henry, love of my life, so if you‚Äôre not emily henry, then please continue on your way-look, emily, my love, i‚Äôm sure i will adore this book and everything in it with all my heart just as i have all of your others. i would buy your grocery list. i would adore your grocery list. i would give up the first born child that i‚Äôm not planning to have for your grocery list.but girl i‚Äôm scared.one of my least favorite tropes is second chance romance. i won‚Äôt recover if this book ends up being the reason that we fall out of love. but i have faith in you and my preordered signed hardcover ‚ô•""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'EH is a master at creating relationship dynamics that make you believe in them. i have read and rated all of her adult romances 5 stars because of her ability to make me fall in love with her characters and this book is no different.i adored reading harriet and wyns past chapters. they had such an enjoyable connection, which made reading their present day chapters so heartbreaking. their entire journey was one i felt super invested in from the beginning and was rooting for them every step of the way. and i really, really loved how EH wrote harriets feelings about wyn. very poetic. very romantic. i actually think this book has some of EHs better writing!so why is this not getting 5 stars then, you ask? it would have if harriet and wyn were the only focus of the book. but a significant part of the story is about their friend group as well, and the whole drama of ‚Äúits our last summer and we are growing apart‚Äù just wasnt as appealing to me. i understand its necessity for the plot, but it just didnt interest me at all. should have know this book would have been a little different based on the cover featuring six people rather than just the classic two.but all in all, a sweet story and another win for EH.‚Ü†4.5 stars'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'i will never recover. ‚ù§Ô∏è\u200dü©π'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'TL;DR: Happy Place felt like an inside joke that I just didn‚Äôt understand. I was sitting there feeling awkward and out of place because a friend group I‚Äôm not a part of was the main character, not the relationship. It was an overall sad read, focusing on friendships drifting apart, parents getting old/dying, and failed expectations (imposed mainly by self doubt and pressure from friends and family). Maybe it‚Äôs cliche to admit, but I truly couldn‚Äôt care about 95% of this book. I didn‚Äôt buy their HEA. Further, Henry‚Äôs writing was way too dense and purple for what was already a heavy read. My happy place was the last page._____Happy Place is very similar to People We Meet on Vacation with the flashbacks and failed relationship that all hinged on a ‚Äúmysterious‚Äù fight. Harriet was wishy washy and was too much of a people pleaser/ problem fixer and Wyn was so self deprecating. The rest of the friends weren‚Äôt interesting. They actually just sucked, especially Sabrina.It was more depressing than anything because it was less romance and more the trials and tribulations of being an adult. That shit is sad and not especially romantic. Plus you get flashbacks of Wyn‚Äôs very alive and healthy parents and then in the present his dad is dead and mother has Parkinson‚Äôs. It was just heavy all around. I‚Äôm not saying romances can‚Äôt deal with real issues and hard topics, but frankly it just didn‚Äôt make for an interesting read and it overshadowed the romance. The phrase ‚Äúhappy place‚Äù is basically a trigger for me now because it kept being repeated.As for the steam, the sex was delayed so long I got bored during the actual scene. They kept getting interrupted by people or or ‚Äúsudden flashes of reality‚Äù during the first 80% of the book, which erased the sexual tension‚Ä¶ so yeah not fun. It‚Äôs a flowery, vague, and short sex scene anyways. Only one scene. The payoff for waiting 9+ hours was the bare minimum.‚ú®**SPOILERS**Further, I simply hated the reason for their breakup. It made me dislike Wyn idc he was too insecure and it being ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt you it‚Äôs me‚Äù is just something that I viscerally hate so much. I understand why he broke it off which even made sense and I don‚Äôt blame him for that, but the way he went about it was so frustrating and selfish.Wyn made the decision for the relationship without talking to Harriet and never really understood that. He does the same thing in the present too. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt move to Montana because I know you better than you know yourself.‚Äù And both times Harriet blames herself!! She‚Äôs not blameless but come on girl. Also she wants to be a potter üò≠üò≠? That was so fucking random lmao. Good thing she got scholarships I guess because throwing away your successful brain surgery career is wild behavior.**END OF SPOILERS**‚ú®As for the writing, Henry uses so many adjectives and metaphors that I can‚Äôt help but feel claustrophobic. It‚Äôs definitely a personal preference but her writing is just so dense. This was my first EH audiobook since Beach Read and I really think it exacerbates the issue. The prose is purple and her metaphors have metaphors.She describes every little detail about every little thing and I got so overwhelmed. The amount of times this man bit his lip, licked his lip, twitched his lip‚Ä¶please god make it stop. My first thought 5% in was ‚Äúwow, so many words.‚Äù So coupled with a boring plot about a group of friends I really didn‚Äôt like‚Ä¶it just really wasn‚Äôt the book for me.Overall, the audiobook in the PRH audio app kept going back several minutes randomly (idk what was going on) and I could barely tell I was rereading parts. The book just blended together in a big blob of blah. The narration itself was great but couldn‚Äôt save a boring book with an HEA I didn‚Äôt believe. This will be the last Emily Henry book I read. I gave it a shot because I love the cover and pink is my kryptonite. But no more. My happy place was the last page.‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.25/5 üå∂Ô∏è.5/5P.S.

That‚Äôs new. And I‚Äôll never be happy without it again.‚ÄùSo, I spent the last 100 pages or so crying. üò™Emily Henry did the damn thing. That ending was perfection. It was everything this story needed and what I needed.There‚Äôs this sense of warmth every time I pick up one of Emily Henry‚Äôs books.I can‚Äôt figure out whether this is a feeling specific to her books alone or the feeling you get when you are reading a story that‚Äôs about to become your favourite.It‚Äôs probably a combination of both.Her stories have all felt magical to me.Bar You and Me on Vacation, but we‚Äôre not talking about that book.I love how this felt so slice of life. So vulnerable, so intimate and human and ordinary in a way that‚Äôs true to real life.I know I‚Äôm reading something wonderful when I find myself pausing, taking a moment to sit with the story and reflect on my own life.It was pretty genius to divide this book into two different timelines.The‚ÄòHappy Place‚Äôchapters felt like I was visiting a really happy andsafeplace, happy moments that these characters experienced where everything felt right in the world.‚ÄòReal Life‚Äôfelt as good as only real life can feel: not enough, bleak, where you find yourself drowning without even realising it, not knowing how you got there and with just enough happy moments felt in between to keep going.Both these timelines allowed us to truly get to know our characters deeply, when life brought out the best in them as well as when life wasn‚Äôt working in their favour.This story just brought out so many feelings within me that I can‚Äôt really articulate. There was almost a sense of desperation to it. By which I mean that these two characters were searching for something within themselves. Of worth, of love, belonging, to be seen as you are,to just be enoughand Emily Henry dissected and captured all of those uncomfortable emotions so well.There isn‚Äôt a thing I would change about it. Wyn and Harry honestly had what dreams are made off. Everything about them two together felt soul-level right. It was a treat to see them fall in love (again).The found family aspect represented belonging in a way that I think we all want to experience, with people who just know and accept you at your core.‚ÄúYou are in all my happiest places. You are where my mind goes when it needs to be soothed.‚ÄùIf, like me, you were doubting a happily ever after, then fear not. I wasfearing. Emily Henry put my feelings through the wringer. Uncalled for but it made that ending so much more worth it. It is a romance, at the end of the day. The most beautiful of love stories.Shoutout to Wyn‚Äôs parents.

More thorough thoughts TK!'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '2 starsü©∑i honestly never thought i would give emily henry a bad rating‚Ä¶but there was so much about this book that I did not like.the plot of the story is basically a second chance romance, between two ex fianc√©s, who reunite after being broken up for five months. the book has a dual timeline (past chapters and present chapters). in the past chapters, they show howwyn (H)andharriet (h)met, how their romance progressed and how it fell apart. while the present scenes show how they slowly start to reunite, while also trying to figure out why the breakup happened in the first place. at the same time, they hide their breakup from their best friends and continue to act like they‚Äôre together out of fear their friend group will fall apart.spoilers belowüëπfirst, i had a problem with the jumps between past and present. i have read books where this worked, but I found myself really wanting to get back to the present scenes and finding the flashback chapters to be very lackluster.one of the biggest problems i had with this book was the break up. throughout the book, the harriet explains the wyn broke up with her over the phone and it happened after some OM drama. essentially, she went out with a coworker and he kissed her. she didn‚Äôt kiss him back, pushed him away and she immediately called wyn to tell him. that‚Äôs when he broke up with her. to make it worse he immediately returns all the her stuff within days of the break up üòïfor him to breakup with her like that after 8 years together ü´•also, wyn never pined or groveled. harriet ended up being the one that groveled and even tried to ‚Äúget revenge‚Äù by looking hot, grinding on him when they were faking it, etc. i guess this was a way to get a ride out of him but it made no sense when she didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. like what is this‚Äì‚ÄúWhat about you?‚Äù he rasps. ‚ÄúAre you with him?‚ÄùThere it is. Acid rises through my stomach. A cleaving goes through my chest.I refuse to cry. Not over something that happened five months ago. Not over someone who‚Äôs already told me he doesn‚Äôt want me.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you think of me?‚Äù I scoot back from him until the wall meets my back. ‚ÄúYou still honestly believe I cheated on you, and beyond that, you think I‚Äôd turn around and do it to someone else too.‚Äù‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying,‚Äù Wyn says, his voice gravelly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not accusing you of anything! I‚Äôm trying to ask\xa0.\xa0.\xa0.‚Äù‚ÄúTrying to ask what, Wyn?‚Äù I demand.‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre happy,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI want to know that you‚Äôre happy too.‚Äùwyn is definitely emily henry‚Äôs worst hero. i hated that he would tell harriet that he was finally happy and then be glad when she lied and said she was too. i felt like wyn didn‚Äôt even try to question it. i do think he was happier now than during his relationship. during the end of their relationship his dad died and his mom was diagnosed with parkinsons. after they breakup he was finally on medication for his recently diagnosed depression, he moved back to montana to be with his mom and finally found a job he loved, so I understand why he was happier now than when he was dating harriet.but he dated her for 8 years but couldn‚Äôt tell she was actually miserable??? i think he wanted to be blind regarding that so he wouldn‚Äôt feel guilty about his newfound happiness in life.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs amazing. Seeing you like this. So happy.‚ÄùHe studies me for a beat before dropping his gaze on a nod. ‚ÄúI am. I‚Äôm really happy.‚Äù[‚Ä¶]‚ÄúYou too, right?‚Äù He matches my gaze.That seesaw feeling rocks through me. ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúMe too.‚Äù‚ÄúGood,‚Äù he says softly.he also broke up with her because she couldn‚Äôt pick a wedding date‚Ä¶YOUR DAD LITERALLY JUST DIED HOW TF WAS SHE JUST GONNA BE LIKE ‚Äúohhh i want a spring wedding and let‚Äôs spend money NEITHER of us have‚Äùwhen they finally get back together at the end of the book, it felt like nothing had changed. part of the reason why they broke up is when they moved to san francisco for harriet‚Äôs residency and he hated feeling inferior to her friends, having shitty jobs and being away from his mom. in the end of the book, harriet quits her residency and moves to montana to make pottery.i really can‚Äôt make this upaselliesaid, in this economy???i mean, wyn had to have known harriet would be very busy?? SHE‚ÄôS IN RESIDENCY üßçüèª\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è she‚Äôs not gonna have the time and energy to talk about their relationship problems. i didn‚Äôt like how EH tried to justify harriet needing to quit just because she didn‚Äôt think she was good at it, she hates the direness of it and she hates the smell of antiseptic‚Ä¶it felt like she decided to start making pottery as a form of income overnight.then harriet tells her parents ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, i‚Äôm gonna pay off the loans myself‚Äù yeah maybe after 200 years üòµ\u200düí´and if she doesn‚Äôt want to be a surgeon, have her become a family practitioner or something??? becoming a neurosurgeon isn‚Äôt the end alli understand that she didn‚Äôt actually like what she was doing but for her to just move across the country to be with wyn was part of the reason they broke up in the first place??? it made zero sense to me.honestly, when they reunited it felt like he was very indifferent about their break up. it seemed like harriet was the one suffering and he didn‚Äôt struggle at all. i think this book desperately needed wyn‚Äôs POV so we could try to understand the reasoning for his actions. why did he lie to harriet, why didn‚Äôt he break up with her sooner, why didn‚Äôt he communicate with her better, why the FUCK did he breakup with her over the phone??? his mental health at that time in his life needed to be explored more for me to understand his thought process. everything about wyn was very flat. nothing about his life was explored, which should have been if that was a major reason for the break upalso who tf tells someone they will always love them when they‚Äôre broken up? it‚Äôs not like he had to change before he fully committed to her againü§® NOTHING CHANGED BETWEEN HIM SAYING I LOVE YOU AND THEM GETTING BACK TOGETHERmake it make sense EH, pleasethe side characters were also boring and I couldn‚Äôt find myself giving any shit about their problemsthis was entirely forgettable but i still love you EH ü´∂üèª'}]"

Ten years later, Jude wants nothing more than to belong there, despite her mortality. But many of the fey despise humans. Especially Prince Cardan, the youngest and wickedest son of the High King.To win a place at the Court, she must defy him‚Äìand face the consequences.As Jude becomes more deeply embroiled in palace intrigues and deceptions, she discovers her own capacity for trickery and bloodshed. But as betrayal threatens to drown the Courts of Faerie in violence, Jude will need to risk her life in a dangerous alliance to save her sisters, and Faerie itself.","[{'rating': 5, 'content': ""‚ÄúHe looks like a faerie lover stepped out of a ballad, the kind where no good comes to the girl who runs away with him.‚ÄùIf you guys ever want to see what my true heart‚Äôs desires are on paper, read this book. This book is a piece of heaven that was sent from above, this book is the perfection incarnate, this book is nothing short of magical, this book easily makes my top five books of all-time list, and this book is without a doubt the best book I‚Äôve read in 2017. I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôm even going to attempt to come up with a review fitting for this masterpiece, but I‚Äôm going to try.Okay, maybe I should start this review off with a personal story. You know, full disclosure and all that. I was a young girl, at the mall with my mom, and we walked into a Borders Outlet. I‚Äôve always been a rather ravenous reader, but at that time in my reading life I was reading only crime thrillers. Think things like James Patterson and John Grisham. Well, while I was perusing the new releases on this autumn day back in the 2007, a worker came up to me and started talking to me about her love for books, but more importantly her love for fae books. She was so kind and warm and enthusiastic, I couldn‚Äôt help but ask her to pick me one of her favorite fae stories. Well, she ended up handing me two, but one of them wasTitheby Holly Black, and this godsend Borders Outlet employee completely changed me and my reading life forever.After that day, and after I inhale read that book, Holly Black became one of my favorite authors and my parents couldn‚Äôt keep unread fae fantasy books on my shelves. And ten years later, I‚Äôve never looked back. I‚Äôve been completely obsessed with fae stories ever since. And if I ever develop magical powers, one of the first thing I‚Äôm going to do is track down that Borders Outlet employee and thank her for making me the reader that I am today.Okay, sappy and heartwarming story aside, this book was honestly perfection in every aspect. You want fae courts? Bloodthirsty fae royals fighting for a crown? Twists after twists and reveals after reveals? Heartwarming scenes followed by heart wrenching scenes? The slowest and most agonizing but also the most romantic and powerful and rewarding hate to love romance in the world? Pick this book up.‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre like a story that hasn‚Äôt happened yet. Because I want to see what you will do. I want to be part of the unfolding of the tale.‚ÄùAnd the writing? I mean, not only is Holly Black the literal queen of all things fae, she is also the queen at stringing together words that make me feel everything in the entire universe. The amount of sticky notes and highlights I have in this book is ridiculous, but Holly Black‚Äôs writing is so poignant and lyrical and honestly the most perfect thing my eyes have ever seen. This entire book reads like one giant tragic ballad, yet it is equal parts heartbreak and hope. This book is so haunting, so dark, and so twisted.‚ÄúBut I will not stand in front of your happiness. I will not even stand in front of misery that you choose for yourself.‚ÄùJude is a very young girl when she witnesses her parents murder. After that terrible night, she and her sisters are whisked away by the murderer to live in Faerie. Now, ten years later, Jude is trying to live among the fae, while constantly being reminded of her mortal human status. Yet, she soon gets wrapped up in a very elaborate game, from many different sides, which will cause a civil war to break out in the Courts of Faerie if the game isn‚Äôt played properly.The High King has ruled for centuries, but people feel like it is finally time for him to step down and give the royal crown to one of his children. In this world, the king chooses his successor; it doesn‚Äôt automatically go to the oldest child. And the High King has six children in line waiting for him to make his choice.Prince Cardan is the youngest son of the High King. He is wicked, and charming, and smart, and maybe even a little cruel. Oh, and he makes Jude‚Äôs life a living hell most of the time. He‚Äôs also one of the best characters I‚Äôve ever read in my entire life.And with Cardan, comes his group of friends: Nicasia who likes power, Valerian who likes violence, and Locke who likes dramatics, but they all love tormenting Jude in very different ways.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what comes of hungering for something; you forget to check if it‚Äôs rotten before you gobble it down‚ÄùEven though Jude is the only point of view, and is the main protagonist of this amazing story, her two sisters play a huge part of this story, too. Taryn is Jude‚Äôs twin, who must watch all the torment that Jude endures, and Vivi is their older sister and one of the best side characters I‚Äôve ever read. She‚Äôs unique and defiant and strong and devoted, and her romance with her girlfriend meant everything to me. Also, Vivi is on the page bisexual and that representation meant even more than everything to me.Oh, and speaking of adorable queer relationships; Ben and Severin, fromThe Darkest Part of the Forest, make a cameo in this and I was crying the happiest tears! I don‚Äôt think I will ever be over THAT whisper, and I‚Äôve just completely accepted that. Be still, my heart.But Jude is our main character of this story, and you can tell from everything that I‚Äôve written above that she doesn‚Äôt have the easiest of lives. See, the fae in this world are very dependent on humans, even though they remind them of their lower status constantly, because the fae women have a very hard and sporadic time conceiving and bearing children, therefore, they rely on humans reproducing for them. Well, Jude doesn‚Äôt want that life, she wants to make a name for herself and be one of the greatest knights that the Courts of Faerie have ever seen!Jude is strong willed and very determined, but she is also one of the most selfless characters I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of reading from. She is a very morally grey character, yet she will completely capture your heart. But she‚Äôs young and learning that love comes in very different forms, and sometimes we are unable to control what we feel.‚ÄúI stand in front of my window and imagine myself a fearless knight, imagine myself a witch who hid her heart in her finger and then chopped her finger off.‚ÄùOne of the most beautiful things about this book is that none of these characters are perfect. Jude, Cardan, all of them do bad things, and none of them are ever excused of their crimes, but they learn to deal with them and the other ramifications that come from their actions. I mean, none of us are perfect people, and we all make bad choices at times. But this book accepts that and reflects that, but also highlights the importance of growing, and becoming a stronger person, and picking what battles you choose to fight. It‚Äôs a truly beautiful message and I really appreciated having a full cast of nonperfect characters that do nonperfect things.‚ÄúBut we all want stupid things. That doesn‚Äôt mean we should have them.‚ÄùAlso, this is a spoiler free review, but I just have toyell from the rooftopssay that Chapter 26 is the best chapter I‚Äôve read in all of literature. I will fight anyone that says otherwise. Chapter 26 tortured me, broke up, killed me, rebirthed me, and gave me new life. The end of Chapter 25 through Chapter 26 was the most romantic scene my eyes have ever witnessed. I feel so blessed to have even been able to read those glorious paragraphs. Like, I‚Äôm a different person after experiencing Chapter 26. When I‚Äôm sad or hurt or angry, I‚Äôm going to reread Chapter 26 so I know the true meaning of this life.‚Äú‚Ä¶like taking a dare to run over knives, like an adrenaline strike of lighting, like the moment when you‚Äôve swum too far out in the sea and there is no going back, only cold black water closing over your head.‚ÄùAlso, fair warning, this book has a cliffhanger ending that puts all other cliffhanger endings to shame. Just typing that sentence gave me full body goosebumps, by the way! Oh, and the title of this book is absolute perfection, as well.This book has touched me in a way that very few books have in my life. This is the type of book that reminds me why I fell in love with reading in the first place. This is the type of book that makes me believe words have the most powerful healing magic of anything in this world. This is the type of book that completely sets my soul on fire and makes me feel utterly enchanted. I just know thatThe Cruel Princeis a once in a lifetime series, because this first installment was everything I have ever wanted in a book.Holly Black immerses me, captivates me, and makes me believe in magic. I have no words of gratitude for that, and I‚Äôm not sure what the world has done to deserve her stories, but I will forever be grateful. Holly Black helps me forget all the actual cruel princes in our world today, and their terrible choices that they are making for all of us. And honestly, I‚Äôd be super surprised if she isn‚Äôt an actual fae queen, that just escaped faerie to torture us with real stories that went on while she was ruling.Again, if you can only preorder one book for the rest of the year, please pickThe Cruel Princeby Holly Black. It‚Äôs not only my favorite book of the year, it‚Äôs one of my favorite books of all time. And then read the rest of Holly Black‚Äôs work, because her books are truly the closest thing to magic and each is a tangible vessel of joy that I have an an unconditional amount of love for.‚ÄúIf I cannot be better than them, I will be so much worse.‚ÄùBlog|Twitter|Tumblr|Instagram|Youtube|TwitchContent warningsfor bullying, talk of suicide, and abuse.The quotes above were taken from an ARC and are subject to change upon publication.(Thank you so much,Diana.

And rereading this was truly the best holiday gift I could have ever given myself. ‚ù§""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '4.5/5 ‚≠êFull review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolfüê∫‚Äú(‚Ä¶) cheekbones sharp enough to cut out a girl‚Äôs heart.‚ÄùI love me a cruel and tipsy Faerie prince and that‚Äôs Cardan and only Cardan.I mean everything I said in the previous sentence. Every. Word. Is. True.Cardan was the best thing happening to this book and if you deny this that that‚Äôs strictly your problem. He‚Äôs a charmer.*I don‚Äôt read hyper-hyped books in general. But when I do, I read them aeons after they‚Äôre out so the hype has worn out and I can enjoy the book (or not) in peace. This one was super hyped. I was plainly curious to see if it really is worth a shot.I truly didn‚Äôt expect the beginning of the book toscreamlike that. That was a power move. And I liked it.Everything that came after that was to lure us into the Faerie world, of what, I must admit, I have only a minimum knowledge of. Everyone is beautiful, but everyone is cruel. Basically, it looks like a circus.It is important for me to be able to grasp the world from the beginning. I feel frustrated when the whole universe unravels as if I just dropped in the middle of what was going on and no one had the time to acknowledge me.I want to feel important from the beginning.Thank you, Holly Black, I did feel important!‚ÄúBeing born mortal is like being born already dead.‚ÄùThis is the story of sisters. Vivienne, Jude and Taryn are three sisters who began their lives in the mortal world and but then were forced to come to Elfhame after their parents got brutally murdered by their soon-to-be foster father ‚Äì Vivienne‚Äôs real father. Vivi is one of them; Jude and Taryn, the twins, are not. This is the story of the sisters‚Äô struggle to be accepted in a world that doesn‚Äôt want them to be part of.Although Jude and Taryn are twins, they are completely different from each other. Where Taryn is ladylike and delicate, silent and obedient, Jude is determined and loud and wild. Where Taryn wants to be granted a place in the Faerie world through marriage, Jude wants to be a knight and play at war.The story is narrated from Jude‚Äôs point of view. That is probably why many people find her annoying. The whole story sounds like her own roaring thoughts and feelings. Maybe she annoys herself too as many of us get annoyed with ourselves and our own thoughts.‚ÄúYou‚Äôre like a story that hasn‚Äôt happened yet.‚ÄùIn a purely honest note, I kind of liked Jude in this book. Sure, she was a bit annoying sometimes, but truth be said, I liked her better than Taryn. There was something about her twin sister that made me repel her. Jude was interesting in a way that made me relate to her. I could totally see me sometimes in her actions. I felt like she was full of her own personality.She‚Äôs power-thirsty. But this is how she was raised to be. To fight, to scheme, to seek and seize power. She‚Äôs the foster daughter of the great general of the Faerie after all. I still consider that a badass trait about her. Don‚Äôt you think?Now, as I previously stated, I think I might have a soft spot for Cardan, the youngest Prince of the Faerie.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs safety in being awful.‚ÄùCardan Greenbriar might seem cruel, reckless, thirsty for violence, but I think he is totally the good boy in disguise type. I mean, at first, I couldn‚Äôt stand him (even though I hated his friends more than I despised him). Then, there was this period of transition where I had mixed feelings about him. 65% in and I just slowly but steadily started to fall in love with him. I started to realise things about him as presented by his actual, intimate actions. And how couldn‚Äôt I fall like a fool? He was a lonely and broken boy. All he wanted was to love and be loved, but no one seemed to care about him enough to grant him that little. What is the whole power in the world of Faerie without an ounce of affection to it?‚ÄúMost of all, I hate you because I think of you. Often. It‚Äôs disgusting and I can‚Äôt stop.‚ÄùHe hates. Hates because he loves. Hate because he‚Äôs not loved.His relationship with Jude starts and unfolds slowly. They have that wonderful love-to-hate relationship that I actually enjoy in books in general.I consider their relationship a bit unhealthy though. What happens between the two of them is a peculiar kind of hate-love. It‚Äôs a game played out of spite. It‚Äôs all about power and desire. I am not sure this is right, but I do believe that this type of relationship is going to improve because from hate to love to hate to love again ‚Äì that‚Äôs an endless wheel that could be stopped anytime, anywhere. One can make a beautiful thing out of something hideous, but one can also ruin the beauty of a thing. Their relationship, in this book, is dangerous ground.Indeed, something about the book seemed off. Even though the world-building was very good and the action was fantastic, the depth of the characters was somehow missing. I wanted them to be more individualised, but I think that‚Äôs just because we see the story through only one character‚Äôs point of view. When you personalise the action, it‚Äôs hard to create well-developed individuals.That, I think, it‚Äôs the only contradictory thing I have to say about this book. Really. I even enjoyed all the bloodshed there. And that‚Äôs not okay. But it was so cleverly crafted that I justhad toenjoy it somehow??____________________________________________Also see:#2.The Wicked King(‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)#3.The Queen of Nothing(‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '*clears throat*Excuse me, uh. Who cares?This is not a rhetorical question. I truly want to know. I read this whole ass book and I am still at a complete loss for something, anything, to care about. Not a plot point, not a character trait, not a single line of quirky banter I could get myself emotionally invested in.https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...This is a book about fairies and it was a trial for me to get through. Me, a person who loves fairies so much she spent her entire third grade year absolutely convinced, in a non-ironic manner, that she was one.It doesn‚Äôt get much more dream audience for this book than me. And I couldn‚Äôt give two sh*ts, or one sh*t, or even a fraction of a sh*t, for so much as a moment. So. Who among you was able to pull off such a feat?Okay, to be fair, maybe I‚Äôm not the dream audience. Holly Black and I have a rocky past. I grew up on the Spiderwick books (well, mostly the Field Guide, which I used as a means of learning about my own species. See the above ‚ÄúI thought I was a fairy‚Äù admission). ButThe Coldest Girl in Coldtownis one of 9 books I‚Äôve DNFed in my entire goddamn life, andThe Darkest Part of the Forestwas another snoozefest.Ilikecharacter-driven stories. I like slow books with beautiful writing. But I don‚Äôt like Holly Black characters, and I don‚Äôt love Holly Black‚Äôs writing, and basically all of her books put me to sleep every time. And also make me feel like I‚Äôm reading the exact same book over and over. Seriously, they all read the same. Including Spiderwick, which is shocking because that 1) is middle grade and 2) has a good deal less sexual tension than a lot of her other stuff.Anyway.This book was so, so boring.Nothing really happens until past the 200-page mark, and by then everything is so silly and ridiculous that I was mostly along for the ride. What, you say? More of the synopsis is out the window? We‚Äôre just deleting more character development from our brains? Delightful.Because, again, who cares.I know a lot of people love this book because they love Jude. I don‚Äôt know why they love Jude. Is she supposedly ‚Äústrong‚Äù or ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù or ‚Äúbadass‚Äù or one of those words we assign to characters when there isn‚Äôt much to describe? Because I‚Äôm not seeing anything to fall in love with.I know a lot of people love this book because they love Cardan. I know exactly why they love Cardan. It is because he is one of three or four YA boy character archetypes that draw in blatant adoration (and delightful fan art) from readers WITHOUT. FAIL.Basically, here are the acceptable YA male traits. You pick a combination of these, and you have your flat, uninteresting, repeat character.- handsome OR beautiful OR hot- funny OR mysterious OR charming- banter-y OR bully-y OR flirtyAnd that‚Äôs it. I often like the handsome/funny/banter-y archetype. From time to time, I‚Äôll enjoy a hot/charming/flirty one.I always, always, always hate the beautiful/mysterious/bully-y one. I hated Will Herondale, and boy oh boy do I hate Cardan.And I know a lot of people love this book because of the plot and the world. But the plot to me was nonexistent, because for 200 pages this book largely made me drag myself through it, with no action or momentum to pull me along. And the world is just Every Holly Black Book But With A Slight Twist, Maybe. And that world hasn‚Äôt worked for me since I was nine and thought myself a resident, my dear boy.Bottom line: I guess the thing with Holly Black is that if one book works for you, they all will. But baby, that goes both ways!---------------pre-reviewthis book is...lame.review to come!!!---------------currently-reading updatesbuddy reading this withlilyandmayand we are definitely all thriving and having a good time. no rage or boredom involved at all---------------tbr reviewjust received official word that i WILL be excommunicated from goodreads if i do not have this book on my shelves'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Jan 2023:Still impossible to put down and I know what happens!! Gotta say, I\'m glad I didn\'t reread this before readingThe Stolen Heirbecause that one would have paled in comparison. Nothing quite like Jude & Cardan.No matter how careful I am, eventually I\'ll make another misstep. I am weak. I am fragile. I am mortal.I hate that most of all.Over the course of this year, I\'ve read both books that I\'ve liked and books I\'ve disliked. I\'ve read books that I\'ve loved and, it\'s fair to say, books that are better written, more unique, and more groundbreaking than this book. That being said, however, I am struggling to recall a book that has left me this excited about a YA series in a very long time.It seems like forever since I read a completely juicy YA fantasy with just the right amount ofdrama, action, surprises, nastiness and the tiniest hints at romantic possibility. The wait for the next book is going to be torture!Holly Black knows her audience so well. She\'s not kind to us because she knows we don\'t really want that anyway. So of courseThe Cruel Princeopens with a brutal murder that leaves Jude, her twin sister Taryn, and their older sister Vivienne at the mercy of the redcap general - Madoc. Jump to ten years later, and the three sisters are all living in Faerie. They\'ve been raised as Madoc\'s own, more or less, and each is trying to find her own place among the beautiful but cruel, deceitful but always honest, fey.For Vivi, return to the human world is the answer. For Taryn, assimilation and playing by the rules is the only way. For our narrator - Jude - rebellion, bloodshed and winning her place in the King\'s council is what she desires.Nicasia\'s wrong about me. I do not desire to do as well in the tournament as one of the fey. I want to win. I do not yearn to be their equal.In my heart, I yearn to best them.It is extremely compelling. Even before the real drama kicks off in the later chapters, I was so wholly pulled into Jude\'s world. The bullying she endures at the hands of her fey classmates adds a heavy dose of unfairness to keep you pissed enough to turn the pages. Then we get to the spying, secrets, betrayals, side-switching and, oh wow, can I just have the next book please?In truth, not a single character is entirely likeable. All are complex, more than a little flawed, and nobody can be trusted. Even Jude. It\'s really quite wonderful. Cardan, the ""cruel prince"" from the title, is an asshole. A drunken, bullying, selfish asshole. And yet... and yet. We shall see.In case it wasn\'t obvious,I loved it. All the drama is absolutely delicious and, while Black does draw on some familiar tropes, the world, characters and politics feel fresh in her hands. It charges to a climax full of surprises and the ending doesn\'t disappoint. Nicely wrapped up but with enough to leave me desperate for the next instalment.

The buzz it ignites is amazing. They create this excitement within you that has your mind wandering to all of the possibilities and direction the book can go in.Because of the hype, I assumed I would enjoy this book. I'm quite an easy-to-please reader, so usually when a book is hyped up, I tend to enjoy it. Or even if I don't, I will feel indifferent. But this book brought about a rage within me; I hated it with every fibre of my being.You may be thinking that because of the fact I 'succumbed' to the hype, it ruined the experience for me. That was not the case at all. I always go in weary, but with a sense of optimism when it comes to hyped books.As for the book, well, everything was wrong with it for me. Other than the slight addictive quality it had - which died for me after I passed the halfway point - this book was weak in every sense of the word. From the protagonist, to the characters, the plot and the world building. There was no development or growth that brought those aspects to live, not even the writing.The story-line started off quite tragic, with Jude's parents being brutally killed off from the bat. From that, I was expecting some kind of revenge story, or emotionally harrowing character development, because to witness that when you're young will obviously take a toll.But no. That wasn't explored. Right off the bat, our main character goes on to enter some kind of tournament she has no experience in whatsoever. There's nothing ingrained within her to take on this challenge, no power she embodies, intellectually or physically. Whilst it took place, all I kept thinking about was how flimsy the battle was, neither did it feel complete. Just rushed.Thus this was the narrative the story carried on. Our main character had no proper background that we as readers were exposed to in order for us to connect with, no experience, and neither had she trained to gain any of it throughout the course of the book. Everything was just thrown (characters and world) at the reader, and felt as if we were expected to go with the flow and further clarification was not given or explained. Event after event took place with no sense of proper progression of the overall plot. No aspect to it whatsoever felt substantial or concrete.I got angrier as I read on and when it got to the last 50 odd pages, I refused to carry on, because I couldn't bring myself to care one bit. It wasn't that it was even mediocre; the whole book felt pointless to me.INITIAL REACTION REVIEW:Well, I'm pretty sure my soul just died. No, it is dead.I haven't hated a book this much since Caraval and I don't tend to hate books that often. I'm indifferent most of the time, and I do enjoy a lot of the ones I read. But this... god. I have no words.Review to come when I can feel again.Ugh.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I do not yearn to be their equal. In my heart, I yearn to best them.Wow, what a start to the trilogy! I'm not sure what I expected going intoThe Cruel Prince, but it certainly wasn't this much fun or this much nastiness.Jude was only seven years old when her parents were brutally murdered in front of her eyes. The man who killed them took her and her sisters to the High Court of Faerie, to be brought up as one of them. Yet, in the ten years since, Jude has never felt like she belonged. As a mortal, she is always less than in the eyes of the Faeries. In particular, she makes an enemy of the cruel Prince Cardan. When treachery comes to the High Court, Jude must figure out what she's really capable of in order to grab the power she so desires.Right off the bat, it's clear that every character in here is somewhat morally corrupt, including our heroine Jude. To survive and thrive, they must continually scheme and do bad things. While I don't normally gravitate towards this sort of story, it works here because everyone's motivations make sense. I feel an emotional connection with each character, so I'm able to cheer them on, even as their actions become crazier and more questionable. It sure makes for an entertaining read, one I can't look away from.The writing is truly top-notch, with a sharpness that keeps me on my toes. I particularly enjoyed the dialogue, which is so witty and scathing that it feels like every line is worth savoring and rereading. The worldbuilding is easy and effortless, drawing the reader seamless into this universe. It proceeds bit by bit, so there's never any confusion or info dumping. And the way every tidbit eventually fits together is satisfying to the extreme.There's so much packed into this one story: politics, family drama, revenge, power, and murder. There's even a bit of romantic intrigue disguised as mutual hate, which is quite delicious. Everything builds up slowly, increasing in tension until we reach a turning point about halfway through. After that, the gloves are off, and we are treated to one surprise after another. I never knew what the next chapter would bring, so I was turning the pages as fast as I could.When I think of a fantasy story I want to sink my teeth into, I'm looking for a few things: sharp writing, well-plotted story, compelling characters, and seamless worldbuilding. And if there's a dash of romance, I certainly wouldn't object. Well, this book has them all, and I'm in awe over how flawlessly everything came together. I can't wait for more.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:#2.The Wicked King~~~~~~~~~~~~‚úßConnect with me‚úßInstagram‚úß""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'I absolutely cannot believe I wasted time out of my freaking life to read this ""book"". I don\'t get the hype and I hate how relationships are portrayed in the story! Authors and reviewers here on Goodreads that Itrustedtrust raved about this book .... and I\'m here lighting the fire so I can burn the pages.....First of all... the writing is horrendous. It\'s the worst case of ""tell, not show"" I\'ve ever seen (Twilight was better written than this): ""I did this, she did that, now I\'m gonna do this ..."". There was no emotion in the writing, I did not feel any attachment toward the world of ""Faerieland"" and I couldn\'t connect with the protagonist, Jude,because I wanted to slap some sense into her the entire time: she acts recklessly, even when other peoplewarn her repeatedly not to do the thingand for the first 200 pages shedoes nothing but complain, indulging in a self-pity party like there is no tomorrow.My heart bleeds0_0.Continuing - the other characters are 2D, the plot is non-existent for the first 200+ pages and the grand finale/epilogue everyone\'s been raving about....left me colder than a dead body dropped in Siberia.I could not care less.An issue that had me concerned while reading this: the character who is heavily hinted as being the love interest:almost every scene in which he makes an appearance showcases how abusive he is, especially towards the MC and no one (from the reviews I have read) flags this as a major problem?. I have little patience for female (and male, for that matter) authors who write abusive love interests and thenabsolve them of all the nasty acts they have perpetrated. In the world of endemic sexual harassment and abusive behaviour, in the world of #metoo and the horrifying stories of women being treated like less than dirt,why do we fall for this type of characters? Why do we keep buying these books? And why do we praise the authors who write them???????.I\'ve wasted enough electricity writing a review for a book that will surely be my worst read of the year.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Absolutely loved this read!! A wondrous fantasy novel that is easy to get invested in. So many great plot twists and high-intensity, suspenseful moments!TW: murder, physical abuse, sexual abuse, suicideHolly Black is truly the queen of creating exquisite worlds. Her interpretation of faeries is always so fascinating and glorious. It‚Äôs hard to fully capture what it is about her world-building that is so magical, but her books are always my favorite when it comes to faeries. I believe a part of it is that she flawlessly captures the danger and darkness of fey while also displaying the beauty of their magic. There are few words to accurately describe her talent for writing intriguing and beautiful fantasy worlds.I really enjoyed the characters in this story. Jude is a great protagonist ‚Äì her fierceness is complimented by her vulnerability, which makes her very realistic considering her circumstances. The relationships between characters are also fascinating, especially the family dynamics. The way Jude views her sisters and ‚Äúadoptive‚Äù family are very unique in my opinion.I also enjoyed the fact that this is not a romance novel. Though it is weaved in here and there, I feel the overarching plot becomes full of politics as the story progress. I will admit, I did lose focus at sometimes while listening to the audiobook because so much of this novel is centered on political relationships, the complications of monarchies, dynamics between different courts, and plotting to overthrow. That being said, it is so well developed and different from many YA books that I overall had a great experience with in.In total, The Cruel Prince was fantastic.

Faeries are portrayed as they\'resupposedto be: not Greek gods with convenient magical powers that spend all their time acting like life is one big fat reality TV show, but actual scary, power-hungry creatures who are terrifying as they are beautiful to behold. Jude and her sisters, Taryn and Vivi, find that out the hard way when one of them bursts into their door in the mortal world andmurders both her parents. It turns out that their mother was previously married - to a fae - and he didn\'t take kindly to cheating.But leaving behind orphans leaves a sour taste in Madoc (jealous faerie ex-husband)\'s mouth so he brings back all three of them to be reared in the world of faerie, where they\'re treated in his household like minor Gentry and resented by pretty much everyone else. Including the Elite 4 - *cough* - I mean the Faerie ""Plastics"": Nicasia, Locke, Valerian, and Cardan. Jude, not knowing when to stand down or keep her mouth shut, ends up bearing the brunt of their humiliations and intimidation tactics, and instead of learning a lesson, she ends up feeling nothing but rage and a desire for revenge.For about 1/3 of this book, it felt like another YA fantasy drama with a mortal girl who ends up biting off more than she can chew with a side-romance that feels tepid. Then about 2/3 in, things start to get really crazy, with court intrigue, espionage, betrayal, murder, poison, and yes, okay, illicit romance. The last 100 pages of this book got even better, and the last fifty had me going ""OMG!!!!"" I received an electronic copy of this book for review, but rest assured, had I been holding a physical copy, I would have been white-knuckling it in a death grip even the most dedicated wrestler would admire.I think this book\'s biggest failing is actually the genre. It\'s forced to dial down the cruelty, the sexuality, and the violence, so sometimes the tone feels a little off. THE HUNGER GAMES, as much as I loved it, had the same problem. YA is still very puritanical, with good reason, butsometimes when authors try to push the envelope within the confines of the parameters set by the age group they\'re writing for, certain topics can feel either unexplored or disconcertingly tame.I almost feel like this would have been better written for an adult audience, with older characters.That small qualm aside, I really enjoyed THE CRUEL PRINCE. I enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed THE HUNGER GAMES and VAMPIRE ACADEMY. I loved that Jude started off selfish and kind of petulant, and gradually learned to hone her cruelty and her callousness into a very successful weapon. I like it when heroines are powerful and dangerous and morally grey, and given roles typically given to male characters in the genre. I also loved the dark prince, Cardan. He and Jude have a real ""Reylo"" dynamic, and I foresee a ""Fifty Shades of Fae"" sequel somewhere down the line for them. #YaassP.S. Still not sure if I mentioned THAT I HATE TARYN A LOT? :D :DP.P.S. Not sure if I understand all the need for subterfuge in the court. Everyone made a big deal of how faeries can\'t lie, so why not just line everyone up and say ""Are you scheming against me or participating in schemes against me, either directly or indirectly?"" and then kill anyone who says ""yes"" or refuses to answer? Why go through all the rigamarole of involving extra spies? See, I\'m a mortal and I\'d make a better faerie ruler than half these losers. #ACourtOfSmutAndCommonSenseThanks to Netgalley/the publisher for the review copy!5 stars'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Cardan Greenbriar holds my heart in his hands, and he looks rather smug about it, theabsolutely perfectinsufferable jerk.This is one of those books where the faerie are actually scary. Yes, they're pretty immature, but they're cruel, terrible people who play with mortals for fun. These are not your Sarah J. Maas fae. They can't control the wind or change shapes -- but they can force humans to do their will, which is almost worse. Unless you wrap a string of rowan berries around your neck or turn your stockings inside-out.Jude and Cardan are characters that make the plot seem like a side thing. I could watch them fold laundry and be perfectly content. Their dynamic is the best thing I've seen since Rowaelin. I noticed farther along that Jude and Cardan are literally just genderswapped versions of each other. She pretends like Cardan is the worst person ever, but just compare them, and you'll see what I mean. They both crave power over others. They both deceive each other without a second thought. It's the perfect love-hate relationship.And that's why I don't think it's problematic. I've seen reviews criticizing Jurdan, but they both tormented each other. Jude ultimately betrayed Cardan in the end. This is one of those relationships where they'll either get married or kill each other. (Please don't kill each other. I love you both too much.)I would welcome Cardan to the part of my heart specifically set aside for cinnamon rolls, but he would probably burn the whole thing down while muttering something about decomposing mortals. Sam Cortland could never.I'm just going to stand here in awe while all of you actually do productive things. I didn't see any of those twists coming. I know I probably should have. But I didn't. And while some may say the plot was too convenient, or too basic, or too convoluted--I was never bored. Not once. Do you have any idea how long it's been since I've been this invested in a novel? Too long, my friends.There is just one thing I would have liked to see more of inThe Cruel Prince,and that's worldbuilding. I still have no idea what a Seelie Court and an Unseelie Court are, and I suppose I could look it up, but I would have preferred an explanation in the book. Maybe I'll get one inThe Wicked King.Even though the atmosphere in Elfhame was just perfect, I wanted to know more about the world outside that of the faerie, and how it all connected to the human world. But that's not enough to take off more than a star, because Cardan and Jude have stolen my heart, and I'm pressing charges.Buddy read withmy fellow Jude stan.

from my blog!If I cannot be better than them, I will be so much worse.God, this book killed me.The Cruel Princehas just about what you‚Äôd expect from Black: court intrigue, an atmosphere of terror, vaguely dark romance, and a main character who is a terrible person, but is also so interesting. Plus some interesting dynamics and setup for an even better sequel. Needless to say, I found it delightful.I think Black‚Äôs tendency is to start a story with a badass opening, then spend 200 pages on slow buildup. At first I thought it was just because this is a series beginner, but the more I think about it, the more I realize her stories never have a typical growth and climax. Instead, she slowly escalates tension until suddenly the situation is horrible and you‚Äôre left wondering how these characters even got there. It‚Äôs an odd style, and one that will be divisive among readers, but it works for me.The plot here is just as slow-burning as usual, perhaps even more so. I personally thought it suited the story quite well. Even when I was slumping, this book was easy to come back to and enjoy. I have to admit, at spots the court intrigue got confusing. Main characters were easy to remember, but I couldn‚Äôt tell most of the Elder King‚Äôs children apart.Maybe my favorite part of this book was the character work. Holly Black is very talented at getting side characters to read real, even without much focus on them. But the real strength of this book is Jude‚Äôs flawed, morally grey character. I fucking loved her. She‚Äôs not the greatest person, but she‚Äôs so incredibly aware of it that I found it hard not to love her.I also wanted to spare a paragraph for the romance. There is a sort-of romance in the first half, and it is honestly the weakest part of the first three-quarters. (See my updates for this book.)Thankfully, this thrown-in and tensionless romance is improved upon further into the book. I‚Äôm not going to spoil it, exactly, but we all know Black loves her Hades/Persephone-esque dynamics. The dynamic between the two characters who I think will get together really turned me off in the first half; I was looking out for some kind of lacking-in-consent bad-boys-are-hawt type thing. That‚Äôs not what you‚Äôll find here. This is much more of a genuine Hades/Persephone dynamic than a bad-boys-are-hot romance. I‚Äôve written about the difference before on my blog, but this is one of the better handlings of it I‚Äôve seen. There was one scene in this book between them that‚Ä¶ well, I think my brain just screamed ‚Äúholy shit‚Äù for a minute straight. One of those scenes I‚Äôm going to bookmark and reread over and over again.Anyway, I definitely loved this. When is book two coming out again?Brief note before I finish this review, and this doesn‚Äôt need much commentary: Ben and Severin had a cameo in this. I almost cried, embarrassingly enough. The Darkest Part of the Forest is one of my favorite books ever. According to a couple other reviews, some of the side characters are also cameos from her first fae series, if you‚Äôre at all interested! I didn‚Äôt notice because I‚Äôve never read it.

And I was completely and utterly wrong.People make this seem like a romance-oriented book; it is not.This book is less about the romance (which only starts to show itself a little by the end) and more about games, intrigue and, most importantly, the characters. It‚Äôs about anger. Betrayal. Revenge. Secrets and, above all, power.

Faeries might always be better than her, but she can be much, much worse. It should not surprise you that I adore her, then.The Cruel Princeis a cruel, enchanting tale of a cruel, enchanting people in a cruel, enchanting world.

With you, to the ends of time.As always, you can check out my chosen soundtrack for the series at the end of the review‚ÄîI went slightly wild there and made a mash up of the three books‚Äô covers to create one for my playlist.The odd thing about ambition is this: You can acquire it like a fever, but it is not so easy to shed.CW‚ûæ abuse, bullying, drugging, speciesism (faeries over humans rather than humans over animals), self harm‚úß Storyline ‚úßOne ordinary night a not so ordinary man drops from the sky into an ordinary human neighborhood riding a not so ordinary horse. He dismounts and walks up to one of the many ordinary houses and, raising his not so ordinary fist, he knocks.The night is no longer ordinary.For inside the house, three little girls watch TV and eat fish sticks with ketchup. For one bears half-faerie blood, while the pair of full human twins do not. For an scared woman comes running from the kitchen and the man calls her wife and traitor. For he kills her and takes the three little girls to faerieland. For in Faerie, there are no fish sticks, no ketchup, and no television.‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre like a story that hasn‚Äôt happened yet. Because I want to see what you will do. I want to be part of the unfolding of the tale.‚ÄùWhat there is in Fearie is a court ruled by the High King, presiding over the three factions of the Seelie Court, the Unseelie court, and the wild fey. And that king has a general‚Äîa faerie whose wife left him pregnant with his heir, a faerie who slaughtered a family one not so ordinary night and took three human girls.Jude is the youngest of the three, the younger twin, and she wants nothing more than to belong, craves nothing more than being knighted and a permanent part of the court. Even if most of the faeries hate humans; even if she is bullied at school by the youngest prince and his gang; even if she is belittled and bloodied and nearly killed.So it should come as a surprise to no one that she would lie and spy and become a vengeful murderess who changes the game. It does anyways.‚ÄúI am tired of caring,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúWhy should I?‚Äù‚ÄúBecause they could kill you!‚Äù‚ÄúThey better,‚Äù I say to her. ‚ÄúBecause anything less than that isn‚Äôt going to work.‚Äù‚úß Storytelling ‚úßShame on you, Mary, for waiting so long to pick up a masterpiece ofHolly Black‚Äôs.A tale so well told. A twisted fairytale so mesmerising. An atmosphere so immersive and pulsing. An eye for detail and consideration and clever themes and additions. A hand wielding words and metaphors as a master swordsman would a sword.I read my first Black book and did not look back.‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen many impossible things. I have seen the acorn before the oak. I have seen the spark before the flame. But never have I seen such as this: A dead woman living. A child born from nothing.‚Äù‚úß Characters ‚úß‚òÖJude:Call her a wrecking ball if you want, call her an annoying bitch if you dare, I would only say you don‚Äôt comprehend the joy of jumping into the canyon of anger, the peace in throwing rules and caution into the wind, the freedom in crossing the line and embracing the glorious beauty of revenge. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the thrill of leaping without being able to see the ground below you, right before you realize that‚Äôs called falling.‚Äù I would say that you‚Äôve never known the colours. I would say you are blind.She is a prideful, unyielding fighter who hates being vulnerable, being controlled. She is a vengeful, violent liar who adores power, adores attention.She is angry and dark and probably needs to see a therapist but, if you told her so, would most likely tell you to go eff yo self and that she can manage herself quite nicely thank you very much.And if you think she‚Äôs starting to sound like me...then whatever do you mean *smiles sweetly*‚ÄúIf you hurt me, I wouldn‚Äôt cry. I would hurt you back.‚ÄùI‚Äôd heardcriticism of Jude‚Äôs reaction to the trauma of her childhoodand agreed with it for the beginning chapters, but then I realised that it‚Äôs merely that she handles the trauma differently.What Jude does is escape thinking about what happened, flee her feelings and fear; and it naturally results in her becoming out of touch with her emotions. She endures and pushes it into the back of her brain due to not knowing another way to cope and that‚Äôs the way that comes naturally to her. She is always afraid, always on alert, so she‚Äôs grown numb and used to it, so she‚Äôs turned tired and angry, so she lashes out.In fact, her mental state is captured accurately, because our personality shapes our response to trauma the same way trauma shapes our personality.She doesn‚Äôt have nightmares not because her trauma has been ignored, but because she can‚Äôt calm her nerves enough to even sleep.Before, I never knew how far I would go. Now I believe I have the answer. I will go as far as there is to go. I will go way too far.And if you put that kind of personality under pressure, it acts much like an elastic object: springing upon release, going wild and hitting everything at close range. She was raised in a house of butchery by a man who delights in war and death and conflict. And because such a man was her father and such a man killed her father, this is the birth of a murderer. Her composed smiles coming unraveled, coming undone.‚ÄúI thought I was supposed to be good and follow the rules. But I am done with being weak. I am done with being good.

But I‚Äôm glad I watched those episodes, because I can now write this:Cardan Greenbriar is literally and thoroughly Gu Jun-pyo fromBoys Over Flowers.But where I only found Jun-pyo entertaining, IloveCardan, probably because of Jude‚Äôs difference from the female lead of the show. With Jun-pyo it was just a petulant boyo lashing out and being angry and bullying and abusing a powerless girl (who still got back at him impressively but still, their personalities where the opposites) while with Cardanit‚Äôs a sparring match.I called him ‚Äúa simple old-school bully‚Äù the very first time we were introduced, and I was both right and wrong. Right because he is an old-school bully, yet wrong because he is not simply so but playfully; Cardan is a clever cruel prince, an angry spoiled/abused child, and a charming adorable coward. Too young, too weak, too mean, too precious! But not ambitious, not like Jude.I blame you guys for being disappointed at first; it was unfair to feel annoyed that he couldn‚Äôt fill the shoes I‚Äôd thought Holly Black was intending for him when shewasn‚Äôtintending those shoes for him. He has his own shiny shoes to stand in and THANK GOD.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs safety in being awful.‚Äù‚úØLocke:First character who intrigued me with his bored, manipulative ways. I spent a long time just repeatingwhat‚Äôs his game what‚Äôs his gamein my notes, I swear, and I find it rather perfect that his game is just that‚Äîa game. This drama-loving fox is one I simultaneously want to kiss and kill and absolutely cannot get enough of.‚úØTaryn:Jude‚Äôs twin sister is much like her while still being the opposite. She, too, wants to belong and would do anything to achieve it; she, too, can be cold and manipulative as the faeries and craves their exotic danger, growing used to recognising bad things as good; and she, too, has had to become something else to survive, something not so human. But where Jude is wildfire, she is ice; one is raging, the other composed. Both burn you in the end.‚ÄúDesire is an odd thing. As soon as it‚Äôs sated, it transmutes. If we receive golden thread, we desire the golden needle.‚Äù‚òÜ Those aren‚Äôt the only ones that made an impact:Madocwith his anger issues and twisted love,Viviwith her raging selfish heart that encourages the same trait in others,Orianawho is way more than she seems. All layered, none all-evil, being a mix of cruel and gentle. I heard someone say this book has an all-Slytherin cast, and I‚Äôm inclined to agree‚Äîno wonder I enjoy them all so much.‚úß Relationships ‚úß‚ÄúLike taking a dare to run over knives, like an adrenaline strike of lightning, like the moment when you‚Äôve swum too far out in the sea and there is no going back, only cold black water closing over your head.‚ù•Romance:Can I just say Chapter 25 & 26? BECAUSE CHAPTER 25 & 26! To be frank with you, I wasn‚Äôt sure at first about these two as I had my doubts regarding Cardan being someone who could possibly match Jude in strength, but I now adore them because I realised the nature of dynamic is a game wheresheis the one with the power (while being terrified of him ever having any power) and he is drawn to that. He likes to challenge her, question her,tryto best her, while actually delighting in her holding a dagger at his throat.They spar; they fight; they have (more or less) the same personality, liars and deceivers and and power-oriented people.Their only difference is that he‚Äôs a pleasure-seeking coward where she‚Äôs a purposeful warrior, and that somehow makes them an even better match.‚ÄúHe‚Äôs flint, you‚Äôre tinder.‚Äù‚ù•Familial Bonds:I‚Äôve already talked too much so I‚Äôll just say that the sisterhood, brother-sister bond, father-daughter relationship...all are written tangibly, conveying the complicated and contradictory feelings that come with being a family (and one so messed up as this) quite perfectly. It was a gem to read.‚úß Worldbuilding ‚úßFaerie might be beautiful, but its beauty is like a golden stag‚Äôs carcass, crawling with maggots beneath his hide, ready to burst.This land of beautiful nightmares, these creatures of twilight and glamours, these clawed hands bearing nevermore and faerie fruit with their superstitious-like practices (e.g. having a necklace of dried rowan berries or wearing your stockings inside out) that are not simply superstitions, all serve to exceptionally bring this world into life and prove that world building is, indeed, Holly Black‚Äôs ultimate strength.In the end, readingThe Cruel Princewith its mythical magic and all the cruelties, deceptions, and (hypocritical) prejudice of its people, feels like wandering through a fairytale that chose the path on its left somewhere down the road, refusing to go right. And you bet I always choose the path on my left as well.‚úß Companions ‚úßBook series playlist:Spotify URLBooks in series:‚û≥ The Cruel Prince (The Folk of the Air, #1) ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚û≥The Lost Sisters(The Folk of the Air, #1.5) ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚û≥The Wicked King(The Folk of the Air, #2) ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚û≥The Queen of Nothing(The Folk of the Air, #3) ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚û≥How the King of Elfhame Learned to Hate Stories(The Folk of the Air, #3.5) ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I know you missed my star auctions‚Ä¶ Here comes the new one! Let‚Äôs start with five billion! Did I hear five centillion! Are you out of your mind? I don‚Äôt think there are centillion stars on the universe! Well, red head lady slaps the bidder and gave this book FIVE CENTILLION STARS anyways! SOLD with an all exclusive trip to fae world ( limitless Chardonnay and tequila shots included)Awwwwwwww I‚Äôm in love with this book! This is definitely a Tarantino story taken place at the Fae World and we have hero and heroine (half human half villanelle) who are cheater, liar, playing dirty and unfair and they‚Äôre match made in heaven. Normally I want to punch the people with those attributes but I‚Äôm drawn to them! I officially let them under my skin and now I‚Äôm singing ‚ÄúHey Jude, don‚Äôt make it bad, take a sad song and make it better‚ÄùThis book is dark, entertaining, captivating and addictive. We have blood freezing, heart throbbing parts like GOT‚Äôs Red Wedding. But the worst part is it finishes so fast now my hands are shaking, legs are tapping, eyes are getting watery, I want it more and I have only one book left! I know the second one is even better. And as soon as I finish it, I‚Äôll suffer from worse addiction withdrawals! There are 49 days for third book‚Äôs release ( shit October is 31 days so it is 50 days!!!! NOOOOOO!!!)As a precaution my husband hid my kindle to prevent me starting the second book and locked me in our wine cellar (Ok, kidding, we‚Äôre not rich! He locked me at my bedroom with one case of Chardonnay, enough food for feeding an army -equal to my one course meal!-) but he forgot I had my spare key. Anyways, I stopped ironing his clothes and dishwashing as a punishment (Well, actually I never do them but don‚Äôt bother! I‚Äôm 2000‚Äôs Peggy Bundy with no children and better hairstyle!)So the things made me falling in love and craving 200 sequel books of this series are:-AMAZING CHARACTERIZATIONS:Two misfit, outsider, black sheep of the families, did I tell you how much I love those wicked hero and ruthless heroine? : Jude and Cardan are my new Mickey and Mallory, Joker and Harley Quinn, Honey Bunny and Pumpkin.Jude witnessed to her parents‚Äô murder when she was a little girl and has been whisked away to live in Faerie world where she is neglected, bullied and unwanted from the others.And Cardan is youngest son of High King, tormented by his own brothers and grow up in a world of wildness, cruelness, savageness. He hasn‚Äôt been loved, pampered and only way to survive is acting like he didn‚Äôt care anything about power games and politics, staying drunk and making vicious and wicked circle of friends: Nicasia: power thirsty, Locke: drama king, Valerian: violence lover.Less lovable and bringers of my slap urge: Locke and Taryn ( no spoilers but they are spineless human beings! Correction: woman being and faerie being)-CLIFFHANGER: I was expecting something surprising will come out and my spider senses didn‚Äôt surprise me (I climb to the walls to celebrate it)-FAST PACING, BLOODY ACTION PARTS, MANIPULATIONS, MIND AND POWER GAMES: I wish Holly Black took the seat of the last season of GOT and gave the bloody, violent and satisfying ending we deserved. At least she didn‚Äôt write something about a raven king, right?-LOVE STORY: Those characters are in love with power and they don‚Äôt know what it means to love somebody but they‚Äôre hopelessly drawn each other. This is Shakespearean kind of tragic story and I can feel it doesn‚Äôt have a proper HEA! But this obsessive, uncontrollable attraction of dark hero and heroine put a big, widen Joker smile on my face. It‚Äôs hot as hell!So 50 days to 3rd book and I‚Äôll wait at least two weeks for the second book. ( It‚Äôs Catch 22 because reading and waiting are equally painful! I wish I could be patient enough till all the books release and I can devour them one by one) As a summary: My vote for Best Fantasy this year is obvious! This is also gotten its place at my all-time favorite books list!'}]"

Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass, #3)
",Sarah J. Maas,4.46,1149002,6650,"Young Adult, Romance, Fantasy, Fiction, Magic, Fae, Young Adult Fantasy",576,02-09-2014,"Celaena has survived deadly contests and shattering heartbreak-but at an unspeakable cost. Now, she must travel to a new land to confront her darkest truth . . . a truth about her heritage that could change her life-and her future-forever. Meanwhile, brutal and monstrous forces are gathering on the horizon, intent on enslaving her world. Will Celaena find the strength to not only fight her inner demons, but to take on the evil that is about to be unleashed?","[{'rating': 5, 'content': '""Enemy. Lover.Queen.""Heir of Fireis undoubtedly one of the best books I\'ve ever read. It certainly will be my favorite book of the year. It is gloriously long and kept me occupied for an entire day (night hours included) making me crave to find out more, but also stop reading so that the book won\'t end just yet.You think you know Celaena from reading the first two books, right? Oh, but you\'re so so wrong. In this book we see her more than broken, relentlessly blaming herself for the fates and deaths of her beloved ones. She takes down her every shield, leaving nothing behind to shed her emptiness threatening to shatter her from the inside out. I believe this was her turning point, the true crossroad in her life, making her see, accept and embrace all that pain, regret and self-loathing she carefully kept hidden inside her soul, etched into her dire and gruesome memories.‚ÄúYou collect scars because you want proof that you are paying for whatever sins you\'ve committed. And I know this because I\'ve been doing the same damn thing for two hundred years. Tell me, do you think you will go to some blessed Afterworld, or do you expect a burning hell? You\'re hoping for hell--because how could you face them in the Afterworld?‚ÄùAnd gods, what memories and past. We are able to witness how she became Celaena Sardothien, how her life changed forever on that fateful night ten years ago. But by facing all that sorrow and darkness, she\'s making a stand. She\'s slowly becoming a queen, one more powerful and deadlier that you could ever imagine.Her character development is phenomenal, because through her new experiences she is stronger, wiser and more determined. Her fierceness was awe-inspiring and I loved that she\'s still the same stubborn, snarky and brave young woman, maybe with her ego a little bruised. She\'s not proud of who she\'s become, abandoning her kingdom and not fighting for rebuilding it for the past ten years, but she\'s ready to throw herself into battle to win back her land. To say that she\'s badass would be an understatement.Celaena makes the transition from assassin to queen with the help of Rowan, a Fae Prince and my favorite new addition to the series. Not that he is so eager to help, but in order to find answers about the Wyrdkeys and how to destroy them, she has to be worthy of entering Doranelle, the land where Queen Maeve awaits her to answer her questions. May I shout something?I LOVE ROWAN WHITETHORN. In the beginning, he\'s infuriatingly patient and stubborn, brooding and secretive. But when he opens up? And when he actuallysmiles?!?Laughs?? Scrap me off the floor cause I am hyperventilating.‚ÄúGods, he was brilliant. Cunning and wicked and brilliant.Even when he beat the hell out of her. Every. Damn. Day.‚ÄùHe\'s an alpha-male in all his glory, with the kickass moves that would bring Celaena\'s to shame. He\'s scary and intense, protective and defying, caring, but lethal when it comes to his enemies. Rowan is the no-nonsense type and I was glad there is finally someone who doesn\'t put up with Celaena\'s bullshit. She throws a verbal punch? He throws one that will leave her with a black eye for the entire week. But they develop a friendship and something so important on the intimate level (not talking about romance) that it will warm your heart to realize that our girl finally has someone to fully rely on. No secrets, no barriers, no judging left between them. They would die for each other, kill for each other, fight for each other. And when they work together, as a pair, as a team, they\'re astounding and terrifying.‚ÄúI claim you, Rowan Whitethorn. I don\'t care what you say and how much you protest. I claim you as my friend.‚ÄùDorian Havilliard is the same swoon-worthy, sentimental, humble (yet a bit arrogant as well) young prince. He will win your heart regardless of the ""team"" you\'re in, because in the end he stands up to his father in a glorious way that had me cheering for him. He is way more mature, weary of everyone and everything and you can see him becoming a true worthy king right before your eyes. A lot of heartbreak and despair was in store for him and I guarantee it will all leave you in a pile of overwhelming feels.In addition to his wonderful character development, Dorian is moving on from Celaena. And I\'m not sure I like who he\'s moving on with. Heck, I don\'t like that he\'s actually moving on. Makes the whole Dorian/Celaena shipping a bit harder. But truth be told now, as much as I was against his new lady Sorscha, I was glad he got a little happiness and support to fight his growing loneliness, worries and magic. And you want to know why? Because freaking Chaol Westfall pretty much abandoned his friend when he needed him the most.Yeah, you read that right. Dedicated, loyal, selfless Chaol was so unable to make up his damn mind that I was uncounsciously pulling my hair. I was very much irritated with him until the very end when he came to his senses. In the aftermath ofCrown of Midnight, his friendship with Dorian is left in shambles and things don\'t get prettier in this book. They grow estranged, but I\'ll give it to the captain that he has only the prince\'s safety and freedom in interest. But keeping secrets, judging, not being able to accept Celaena\'s and Dorian\'s powers -- all these things make me wonder if he has any shot left at our heroine\'s heart, because whereas Celaena would always pick him, Aelin would not.‚ÄúAs for Celaena,‚Äù he said again, ‚Äú you do not have the right to wish she were not what she is. The only thing you have a right to do is decide whether you are her enemy or her friend.‚ÄùWe meet awesome warrior Aedion Ashryver, Celaena\'s cousin and childhood best friend. He\'s all deadly smiles, muscles and wild behavior. Aedion is daring, clever and doesn\'t give a rat\'s ass about anyone but himself. Or so they say. But he\'s dead set on taking down the King of Adarlan from the inside. When he finds out Aelin is alive, he makes it clear that he would move mountains in order to see his true queen back in Terrasen. He\'s loyal, determined, skilled and I hope he reunites with Celaena sooner rather than later, because he is in a pretty bad place at the end of the book.""A cry went up from the witches, save for the Thirteen‚Äî¬¨who stayed cool and quiet. They did not need to cheer, for they ¬¨were immortal and infinite and gloriously, wonderfully deadly.‚ÄùAnother addition to the newbie characters is Manon Blackbeak, heir of the Blackbeak coven of the Ironteeth witches and leader of the Thirteen. The witches play a big role in the King\'s newest and darkest plans by being the riders of the wyverns he has created and Manon wants nothing more than to lead them into battle as Wing Leader. She wants to prove herself and although she is a bloodthirsty, wicked creature, I completely loved her. She\'s by no means a villain, just a different kind of heroine, firm and unyielding, with great ambition. Her encounters and silent dialogues with Abraxos cracked me up, because in that moments you could glimpse (besides the wyvern\'s total awesomeness) how Manon starts believing there\'s a chance she has a heart and soul and that her grandmother\'s rules might not be the best to follow.‚ÄúWitches didn\'t need blood to survive, but humans didn\'t need wine, either.‚ÄùThe King of Adarlan is still the biggest bastard I\'ve had the (dis)pleasure of reading. I loathe the guy with every fiber of my being. He is wicked to the core, manipulative and selfish to no end. No, not just selfish, but greedy. Greedy for everything and anything, exactly like a monster. And what he did at the end, to my poor baby Dorian, made me wish that once Celaena comes back -- because she will come back -- she won\'t kill him. Oh no, I want her to keep him locked in a basement, to visit him everyday and torture him until he breaks, only to do it all over again the next day, because killing him would be too much of a mercy for the deeds he has done.The other secondary characters were very well developed: the Ironteeth witches, Ren Allsbrook, Emrys, Luca and Maeve -- they were a testimony to SJM\'s awesome writing skills. And I might add that for me the writing style was slightly different. Improved. Better. More realistic, if you wish. There was a certain ease with which she used words that enchanted you completely. Plus, the swearing. I don\'t mind it one bit, but am I the only one that noticed it appeared more often than in the first two books? Matured characters, matured world, matured language, I guess.The atmosphere is darker and the pace is thrilling, allowing you to breath for a bit before another near-death encounter or epic battle starts. The world-building was another winner, as we were able to see Wendlyn, Doranelle, the Ferien Gap and Adarlan again. We learn about the past, we meet Queen Maeve (who\'s quite a manipulative bitch), we run from terrifying creatures and we accompany Celaena as she masters her powers.There isn\'t so much romance in the air, besides Dorian\'s plotline, because it\'s the last thing in our character\'s mind. And honestly, I don\'t really know who Celaena is going to end up with. Chaol still has issues with her and Dorian is currently viewing her as his friend, but things could still drastically change since there are 3 more books. It seems that even Aedion, her cousin, might have a shot since he wouldn\'t deny anything his queen would ask of him. And then there\'s Rowan who I\'m not sure will actually have a romantic involvement with Aelin, but it\'s worth hoping for -- they would be unstoppable.‚ÄúHe would not apologize for today, or yesterday, or for any of it. And she would not ask him to, not now that she understood that in the weeks she had been looking at him it had been like gazing at a reflection. No wonder she had loathed him.‚ÄùIn terms of plot, you could say it\'s action-driven, but I beg to differ: the character development plays a part as big as the twists and turns and fights. It sure keeps you at the edge of your seat, courtesy of Sarah J. Mass\' amazing writing, and makes you shudder at some new evil creatures or at the violence, but I basically viewHeir of Fireas Celaena\'s healing journey, one necessary to fully accept her legacy.‚ÄúSo you‚Äôd save another land, but not yours. Why can‚Äôt your friend save her own kingdom?‚Äù‚ÄúBecause she is dead!‚Äù She screamed the last word so loudly it burned in her throat. ‚ÄúBecause she is dead, and I am left with my worthless life!‚ÄùTheThrone of Glassseries slowly becomes a younger version ofGame of Thrones(with less deaths, but keep in mind that there are worse fates than death...) and I couldn\'t be happier. With the same complexity, a gut-wrenching intensity and an amazing world,Heir of Firebrings out the big guns: twists, emotional punches, tearjerkers and amazing characters, not to mention the wonderfully built world. It\'s definitely the best one from the series yet and a total game-changer, so don\'t be surprised if it will keep you enthralled from start to finish. Fantasy to its finest, a story with heroes and monsters, Fae and humans, life and death. Read it the second it hits shelves, cause you won\'t be disappointed (unless you\'re the type that can\'t stomach the idea of enduring another year for the next book and to whom I recommend waiting a bit longer, because there is one hell of a cliff-hanger).If you\'re looking for anything ToG related then check out thisThrone of Glass fansite.ENJOY!<3'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5/5 ‚≠êFull review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolfüê∫*stares blankly in space trying to think a way of living life now after this book destroyed me*I just don‚Äôt even know what can I say about this book. It‚Äôs like everything I try to say gets validated and discarded at the same time. It feels frustrating and I am still not going to cope with it any time soon.It is alwaysveryhard for me to write reviews for theThrone of Glassbooks. I mean, it is somehow impossible. I thoughtCrown of Midnightwas hard to write, but holy gods, I think this one beat it (I don‚Äôt even want to think in how many ways the rest of the series is going to murder me).A very important part of this book is Rowan Whitethorn, a Fae warrior prince who will initially seem the most obnoxious creature on earth, but until the end of this book, you‚Äôll fall completely in love with him. His harshness and heart of stone are only the veils that cover Rowan‚Äôs true spirit ‚Äì a gentle spirit; an honourable man with a true sense of loyalty.‚ÄûLoyalty is earned, not given.‚ÄùAnother important part of the book is the apparition of Aelin‚Äôs long lost cousin, general Aedion Ashryver. His unshakable loyalty for his beloved cousin made him do atrocious things in the past ten years, but he still believes in Aelin‚Äôs return and is ready to sacrifice anything and everything to help her reign over her people, freeing them all, saving their lives.And if you thought I was done with important parts, you‚Äôre awfully wrong. There is yet another very important part of the book and that is the magnificent appearance of the Ironteeth witch Manon Blackbeak. I don‚Äôt know how this happened, maybe I am the only one, maybe I am the one of the few, maybe the one of the many, but I love Manon. I really do love her character and her story and it makes me feel so attached to her knowing all the wicked things she and her coven went through in order to become these lethal creatures, heartless and soulless. Let‚Äôs give a sister the appreciation she deserves!I am sorry to announce though that throughout the book the most boring of all characters had to be Chaol. I really am sorry, I actually skipped a couple of his chapters.Oops.Until the end of the book though, my heart got so warm with love for him and also for my pretty prince Dorian that I just couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. Don‚Äôt want to sound too much, but boy, Chaol and Dorian really turned out to be the real OTP of the whole bookand I am living for it.As you already know (and if you don‚Äôt let me enlight you), I have a tendency to infiltrate someRomanianismsin my reviews. I know I am the only one in this whole wide world to make connections between a book I read and my language and culture but IT IS TRUE AND IT REALLY GOES RIGHTin my heart.InHeir of Fire, there is a particular celebration going on on some point in Mistward and that one is called Beltane, which consists of bonfires being ignited at night for some brave people who are ready to jump across them for good luck and good lives. Here in Romania, we have this very same tradition (minus the music and the food, we only get sweets while attending). Our celebration is calledFocul lui Sumendru, a Romanian tradition who is two thousand years old and it pretty much is the same as Beltane, but as in book Beltane is held in spring, ourFocis held in autumn, in order to keep the autumn steady as long as it can, to belate the harsh winter. Pretty cool, yeah, but DO NOT TRY IT AT HOME!Okay, now that I‚Äôve also opened the celebration discussion and also closed it I would very much like to mention that it is very imperious (if you allow me to say so) that youdo notread this book in public! It gets very emotional and if you are like me, then it is a very complicated job to contain yourself while reading it.Seriously, my face almost cracked while trying to repress a very unladylike word from getting out my throat.Also, for my Romanians - Have you ever experiencedFocul lui Sumendru?'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I\'m not sure what to say aboutHeir of Fire. Perhaps I don\'t need to say anything beyond:it took memonthsto read it.And I am the kind ofcrazypassionate reader that finishes good books in a day or two. It\'s been a while since a book took me longer than a week to read.So basically:I liked but had issues withThrone of Glass.I absolutely LOVEDCrown of Midnight.But this book... this book was so... bloody... sloooooowwwwwww.I wanted to DNF it so bad. I kept moving it between my ""currently reading"" and ""on hold"" shelves. I kept wondering if I could possibly just skip the last two thirds of this book and somehow pick the story up in next installment (I was informed that I could not). I have invested so much time and love in this series and these characters that I simply had to make myself finish... but holy shit, it was such a struggle.The majority of this book?So Maas tries to experiment with a bit of something different here and it neither a) works, nor b) fills me with much confidence for the state of the rest of the series. I\'m seeing the way this whole thing is going...Book one was fantasy-lite with a simplistic plot, filled with characters lacking in any real development to distinguish them from others in the genre, but it was fast-paced, sugary entertainment. Book two cranked it up several notches; here the characters became more fleshed out and nuanced, the plot was equally engaging but more complex and clever, and there was way more badassery. No complaints at all. And then we arrive at book three.Heir of Firefeels like an attempt to be more sophisticated. It is well-written, contains several stories told through constantly changing POVs, and it is more than a hundred pages longer. And it is far far slower. Maas sacrifices everything deliciously fast-paced and compelling about her series in the first half so we can be introduced to a whole new cast of characters we don\'t care about, be taken through different (all boring) perspectives, and emerge feeling like we\'ve read an extremely long filler book.Dorian\'s new romance only served to remind me why I found him unbearably boring in the first book. Celaena - now in Wendlyn - meets a whole set of new people who failed to make any kind of impression on me. Even Chaol - whom I absolutely loved in both other books - lost his charm somewhere amid his own boring plot line. And just when I thought I might be starting to get invested in one of the stories, the chapter would end and I would leave the story of interest for at least fifty pages, guaranteeing that I would no longer care when we finally returned.The most annoying thing about this book is how it wasn\'t even consistently slow. We\'d get tiny little tidbits of awesome that would last a mere two or three pages and I would sit up a bit straighter and think ""This is it. Finally we\'re getting to the good stuff..."" until I realised it was just a false alarm and the story was still boring.If I\'m to give credit where it\'s due, I will say that I like the way Maas portrays friendships and makes them as important - if not more important - than the romantic relationships. It\'s an area of YA so often neglected and I find it especially refreshing to see a platonic relationship between young male and female characters crafted so well.I will be reading the next book just because I have to give it a shot, but my expectations have been significantly lowered.Blog|Leafmarks|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Tumblr'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'SHE WOULD NOT BE AFRAID!!!!!!!!! üò≠üò≠üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è\u200düî•‚ù§Ô∏è\u200düî•‚ù§Ô∏è\u200düî•‚ù§Ô∏è\u200düî•'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Sarah J Mass is a capital G God.

T_TI thought I‚Äôd be able to write about ‚ÄúHeir of Fire‚Äù without getting all too emotional but as it seems all my plans and good intentions just went out of the window. I can‚Äôt write about this book without getting emotional! I just can‚Äôt! It was too much!! That ending was too much!!! WHY?WHY THE FREAKIDY FREAKING HELL, SARAH!!!!????How could you do this to me??!!HOW?!I LOVE THIS BOOK!BUT I HATE THIS ENDING SO MUCH!I hate it,I love it,I hate that I love it,I love that I hate it!ADSFJKLMN√ñ ADKFASLDFJASDKFASDK!*throws book against the wall**a second time**for good measure*Okay, I think I‚Äôm ready to continue now. *takes deep breath and collects herself*All right! Let‚Äôs do this!Just like with ‚ÄúCrown of Midnight‚Äù I won‚Äôt waste your time by writing about the plot. It‚Äôs way too complex to explain it without any spoilers and because of that, I guess it might be best if I just go for another round of ‚ÄúKeyword Boggle‚Äù!It was so much fun the last time around, wasn‚Äôt it? ;-PSo here I go: Celaena, Dorian, Chaol, Rowan, Aelin, Manon, Abraxos, Sorscha, The King, magic, faeries, witches, darkness, fire, ice, wind, a kitchen, a healer, an apartment, blood, murder, and let‚Äôs not forget about the black stones. XDI guess by now you could write your own book! *lol*We‚Äôre still speaking about Sarah‚Äôs book though, so I‚Äôll head directly into the characters section and won‚Äôt keep you in suspense any longer.The characters:Do I still have to say it? Yes? Okay! Beware of my characters section because it‚Äôs known as the spoilery spoiler section of my reviews! Don‚Äôt read on, close your eyes, eat an ice, please think twice, I‚Äôm not nice, my reviews have spice. And spoilers, lots of spoilers, but you already know that or you wouldn‚Äôt have continued to read that bad rhyme! ;-PCelaena:‚ÄùSo you‚Äôd save another land, but not yours. Why can‚Äôt your friend save her own kingdom?‚Äù‚ÄúBecause she is dead!‚Äù She screamed the last word so loudly it burned in her throat. ‚ÄúBecause she is dead, and I am left with my worthless life!‚Äù*sighs deeply* Oh, Celaena! How much pain does this poor girl have to endure? It hurt to read about her feelings after Nehemia‚Äôs death, it hurt to read how much she ached and wished she could have been someone else. That she could have saved her friend. That Nehemia would live instead of her. That Chaol would have trusted her. That he would have told her‚Ä¶ Oh boy, Celaena‚Äôs heart was a black void of desperation and pain that only seemed to get worse before it even got a chance to get better. In the end it did get better though and I‚Äôm so happy about that! She finally found her inner strength and she accepted her heritage! Which is awesome, because I really can‚Äôt wait for her to kick some ass! *lol* Heaven knows the King‚Äôs behind is already a formidable target and please Sarah if there is any justice in your world you‚Äôll let him burn for what he did!!! You‚Äôll let him suffer for all the pain he caused!!! I can‚Äôt wait to see Celaena‚Äôs power unleashed! Guess the palace is going to be ‚Äúhot stuff‚Äù soon! ;-P‚ÄùHe had chosen the king. Even though he‚Äôd claimed he loved her, he still loyally served that monster. Maybe she had been a fool for letting him in, for dreaming of a world where she could ignore the fact that he was captain to the man who had shattered her life again and again.‚Äù‚ÄùNo, all she could see were the slaves she‚Äôd left behind, the ashy mountains and those mass graves they dug every day, the faces of her people, who had worked beside her ‚Äì her people whom she had left behind. Whom she had let herself forget, had let suffer; who had prayed for salvation, holding out hope that someone, anyone would remember them.She had abandoned them ‚Äì and she had been too late.‚Äù‚ÄùShe would not let that light go out. She would fill the world with it, with her light ‚Äì her gift. She would light up the darkness, so brightly that all who were lost or wounded or broken would find their way to it, a beacon for those who still dwelled in that abyss. It would not take a monster to destroy a monster ‚Äì but light, light to drive out darkness.She was not afraid.‚ÄùChaol:‚ÄùHe was afraid of what they would do to his kingdom. Because this was still his kingdom. He was working for Dorian, not Aelin ‚Äì not Aedion. And he didn‚Äôt know where all of this put him.‚ÄùYESH! I know it was a long and hard way for Chaol but as it seems he‚Äôs finally on the right track! I loved that he began to question everything. He was so insecure and hurt that he had no other choice than to face his outlook on things and in the end this eventually forced him to see behind the kings carefully kept fa√ßade. Which is awesome, because I know deep down within him Chaol is a very good man!!! He was just completely oblivious to the fact that the served a monster! Still, I‚Äôm glad he decided for Dorian and I swear if Celaena and Chaol don‚Äôt do anything about this damn ending, I‚Äôm going to riot!!!! CHAOL you gotta help your Prince and rightful king!!!!‚ÄùI will not turn my back on my kingdom or my prince,‚Äù Chaol snapped. ‚ÄúI will not fight in your army and slaughter my people. And I will not break my vow to my father.‚Äù His honor might very well be all he would have left after the end of this.Aedion was quiet long enough that Chaol got up to leave. But then the general said, ‚ÄúWhat would you have given ‚Äì just to see her again?‚ÄùChaol couldn‚Äôt turn around as he said, ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter now.‚ÄùChaol kept his sword drawn. ‚ÄúI will not go to Anielle,‚Äù he growled. ‚ÄúAnd I will not serve you a moment longer. There is one true king in this room ‚Äì there always has been. And he is not sitting on that throne.‚ÄùDorian:‚ÄùOnce Dorian might have already said something about it. But having magic, getting drawn into whatever mess Celaena was in, seeing that other world in the secret tunnels ‚Ä¶ all of that had changed everything. The best he could do these days was maintain a low profile ‚Äì to keep his father or anyone else from looking too long in his direction.‚ÄùWHY SARAH??!! WHYYYYY? *breaks down and sobs*Why do you have to use him as a human punching bag? Dorian is so decent and compassionate; he doesn‚Äôt deserve to be broken!!! First you hurt him by finding out about Chaol‚Äôs and Celaena‚Äôs secret, then you kill off his girlfriend and in the end you even let him be forced into the Kings slavery!!??LIKE SERIOUSLY!!?? WTFH!!?? WTF!!?? I CAN‚ÄôT WITH THIS ENDING!!! I JUST CAN‚ÄôT!!! HE SUFFERED ENOUGH!!!I don‚Äôt even want to know what is going to happen now that he‚Äôs wearing this freaking collar! He saved Chaol‚Äôs life! GODDAMNIT!!! GIVE MY BOY A BREAK!!! Sarah, I swear it here and now if Dorian isn‚Äôt saved by the end of book 4 I won‚Äôt continue to read this series. I just won‚Äôt! I know it‚Äôs the author‚Äôs right and decision to kill off characters or to make them suffer as they please, but I just can‚Äôt take it anymore. Dorian is my cutiepie and cinnamon roll and I think my heart hurts enough! I survived 3 books of ACOTAR watching how my precious Lucien went through hell and I just can‚Äôt take this anymore. Lucien never got his happily ever after and it still hurts!!! So no, sorry but no! If Dorian isn‚Äôt at least halfway alright after ‚ÄúQueen of Shadows‚Äù then I‚Äôm quitting this series! Period! I made up my mind! There was so much potential to give Dorian‚Äôs character a chance to evolve and to be awesome and interesting! So much raw magic that could have been used, but all that happened was that Sorscha died and Dorian sacrificed himself for Chaol. I‚Äôm pissed, I‚Äôm majorly pissed! And coming from me that means a lot! So yeah, this wrong is better set right or I‚Äôm quitting! I‚Äôm serious and I mean it! This said:#TeamDorian forever and for always!!! <333‚ÄùHe‚Äôd been a fool once, swearing he would tear the world apart for Celaena. A boy in love with a wildfire ‚Äì or believing he was in love with one.‚Äù‚ÄùBecause you‚Äôre not really scared of those things, are you? No ‚Äì it‚Äôs what they represent. The change. But let me tell you,‚Äù Dorian breathed, his magic flickering and then subsiding in a flash of pain, ‚Äúthings have already changed. And changed because of you. I have magic ‚Äì there is no undoing that, not getting rid of it. And as for Celaena ‚Ä¶‚Äù He clamped down on the power that surged as he imagined ‚Äì for the first time, he realized ‚Äì what it was to be her. ‚ÄúAs for Celaena,‚Äù he said again, ‚Äúyou do not have the right to wish she were not what she is. The only thing you have a right to do is decide whether you are her enemy or her friend.‚Äù‚ÄùWe‚Äôre all risking something.‚Äù There was so little of the friend he‚Äôd grown up with. The prince glanced at his pocket watch. ‚ÄúI need to go.‚Äù Dorian stalked to the stairs, and there was no fear in his face, no doubt, as he said, ‚ÄúYou gave me the truth today, so I‚Äôll share mine: even if it meant us being friends again, I don‚Äôt think I would want to go back to how it was before ‚Äì who I was before. And this ‚Ä¶‚Äù He jerked his chin towards the scattered crystals and the bowl of water. ‚ÄúI think this is a good change, too. Don‚Äôt fear it.‚ÄùAedion Ashryver:‚ÄùHandsome was a light way of describing what Aedion was. Overwhelming was more like it. Towering and heavily muscled, Aedion was every inch the warrior rumor claimed him to be.‚ÄùI like Aedion! I like him a lot!!! He‚Äôs such a tortured soul and he tried everything possible in order to protect his people! He was an intriguing new character and I can‚Äôt wait to see more of him. I really liked his interactions with Dorian because they were so much fun! *lol* Those two have a lot of potential to become close friends, but I guess the ending of this book kind of nullified that possibility. Still, I want Aedion‚Äôs noble and brave soul to be rescued as well and I don‚Äôt even want to know what the king is going to do with him. T_T I hope Aelin returns soon because her boys definitely need her right now! Poor Aedion, he waited for so long!!! And if I‚Äôm already at it! He saved Chaol‚Äôs ass too, so Chaol better get his groove on! He needs to make plans to save him as well! XD‚ÄùCousin ‚Äì that had been his most beloved title. Cousin, kin, protector. Those were the secret names he harboured deep within, the names he whispered to himself when the northern wind was shrieking through the Staghorns.‚Äù‚ÄùAelin would come back from Wendlyn, no matter what the captain believed. Aelin would come back, and when she did ‚Ä¶ With every breath, Aedion felt that lingering scent wrapping tighter around his heart and soul. When she came back, he was never letting her go.‚Äù‚ÄùAll you monsters can burn in hell. Because my queen is coming ‚Äì and she will spike you to the walls of your godsdamned castle. And I can‚Äôt wait to help her gut you like the pig you are.‚Äù He spat at the king‚Äôs feet, right on top of the fake ring that had stopped bouncing.Rowan:‚ÄùShe noticed then that his arms were bandaged, and more bandages across his broad chest peeked up from beneath his shirt. She‚Äôd burned him again. And yet he had held on to her ‚Äì had run all the way here and not let go once.‚ÄùThe fierce, broody and intense warrior! I like him even though I have to admit that his abilities as a teacher kind of lack experience. *lol* Still, he‚Äôs a decent fae and despite the way he acted at the beginning of the book his heart actually seems to be in the right place. I loved that he took care of Celaena once he realised why she‚Äôs so broken and I suppose their fight at the beginning was kind of necessary. They both needed to let off some steam. XD I genuinely hope we‚Äôll see more of him in the next book, because I feel like there is so much more to tell! ;-)‚ÄùHow ‚Äì how did you come back from that kind of loss?‚Äù‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt. For a long while I couldn‚Äôt. I think I‚Äôm still ‚Ä¶ not back. I might never be.‚ÄùShe nodded, lips pressed tight, and glanced toward the window.‚ÄúBut maybe,‚Äù he said, quietly enough that she looked at him again. He didn‚Äôt smile, but his eyes were inquisitive. ‚ÄúMaybe we could find the way back together.‚ÄùManon:Silent as death, Manon slid up behind him. The fool didn‚Äôt even know she was there until she brought her mouth close to his ear and whispered, ‚ÄúWrong kind of witch.‚ÄùI‚ÄôM IN LOVE WITH MANON BLACKBEAK!!!This woman is so savage and fierce! I love it! *lol* As it seems for once my prayers were answered! I got more of the iron teeth witches and I loved every single chapter! XD Manon is so damn amazing! I just couldn‚Äôt get enough of her and followed her storyline closely. Truth be told, I just want to lean back and watch how her and Abraxos change the world. Haha! I disliked Manon‚Äôs grandmother a lot though and even though she became Wing Leader I‚Äôm pretty sure there will be some major estrangement in the future. Still, I loved Manon‚Äôs connection with Asterin and her Thirteen and I really hope they‚Äôll always be at her side. Maybe Petrah will join them one day? Idk! I truly hope she‚Äôll be fine some day because I really liked her too. >_<‚ÄùYou‚Äôre mine,‚Äù Manon said to him.The wyvern blinked at her, Titus‚Äôs blood still dripping from his cracked and broken teeth, and Manon had the feeling that he had come to the same decision. Perhaps he had known long before tonight, and his fight with Titus hadn‚Äôt been so much about survival as it had been a challenge to claim her.As his rider. As his mistress. As his.‚Äù‚ÄùAnd Manon, because no one was watching, because she did not care, flung out her arms as well and savoured the freefall, the wind now a song in her ears, in her shriveled heart.‚Äù‚ÄùYou touch him again,‚Äù Manon said, ‚Äúand I‚Äôll drink the marrow from your bones.‚ÄùThe friendships & ships:Chaol & Dorian:He met Dorian‚Äôs gaze. There was nothing kind in it. But Dorian said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying, Chaol.‚ÄùTrying, because Chaol‚Äôs not consulting him on the plan to get Celaena out of Adarlan had been a breach of trust, and one that shamed him, though Dorian could never know that, either. ‚ÄúI know.‚ÄùOh, those two broke my heart! I really wanted them to solve their problems and then this damn ending came along!!! ARGH! They need a chance to fix all this! Sarah give them a chance, please!? They deserve it! AndOMG Chaol told Dorian that he loves him!!!Way too late but he did it!!! <33 I just want my two boys to be happy and friends again. *sobs* They both suffered enough in those last two books, they really deserve some peace!!! And to take away their chance to make amends!! So mean, Sarah! So, so mean!!! >_<‚ÄùYou think I‚Äôd run to my father?‚Äù The words were barely more than a strangled whisper as the temperature plummeted.Chaol stepped forward, putting himself between Aedion and Dorian, his palms exposed. Placating. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt afford to guess ‚Äì to hope. Even with you.‚Äù‚ÄùYou cannot pick and choose what parts of her to love.‚Äù He pitied Chaol, he realized. His heart hurt for his friend, for all that Chaol had surely been realizing these past few months. ‚ÄúJust as you cannot pick which parts of me you accept.‚Äù‚ÄùHe looked at his friend, perhaps for the last time, and said what he had always known, from the moment they‚Äôd met, when he‚Äôd understood that the prince was his brother in soul. ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù Dorian merely nodded, eyes still blazing, and lifted his hands again towards his father. Brother. Friend. King.Sorscha & Dorian:‚ÄùShe usually talked like this when she was nervous. Which, Dorian had noticed with some satisfaction, was when he came near. And not in a bad way ‚Äì if he‚Äôd sensed that she was truly uncomfortable, he‚Äôd have kept his distance. This was more ‚Ä¶ flustered. He liked flustered.‚ÄùI suppose their relationship was doomed right from the beginning but I still would have liked it to work out. They were so sweet together, but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I missed some major parts of their plot. I really wish Sarah would have given us more of them because to me their entire storyline felt kinda rushed. Still, I was glad Sorscha helped Dorian to hide his magic and her being a spy was such an unexpected plot twist. >_< It really killed me when the King ordered her death and I can‚Äôt even describe how much Dorian‚Äôs pain hurt me! T_T I‚Äôm still not over this‚Ä¶ probably I‚Äôll never be!‚ÄùYes,‚Äù he breathed, and kissed her. It was fast ‚Äì but her face was flushed, and her eyes wide as he pulled back. His own eyes were wide, gods be damned, and he was still rubbing his thumb against her soft cheek. Still contemplating going back for more, because that hadn‚Äôt been nearly enough.‚ÄùCelaena & Rowan:‚ÄùWhy don‚Äôt you just bite me again?‚Äù‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt I give you the lashing you deserve?‚ÄùHe looked so dead set on it that she blinked. ‚ÄúIf you ever take a whip to me, I will skin you alive.‚ÄùOh, ho ho! Those two!! So much passion, so much pain! They were quite a sight to behold! *lol* I loved how their initial animosity turned into a solid friendship and I was so glad Celaena finally told someone about her past! This was so damn necessary and I‚Äôm glad Rowan was there to listen to her troubles and fears! <3 I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll become lovers in the future, but as it seems Sarah just wants to torture us a little bit more. ;-P After all she‚Äôs good at that, torture seems to be her middle name! XD Bet the J. is just a fib! Haha!‚ÄùIt was a selfish wish, and a fool‚Äôs hope.‚Äù She read the rest of it in his eyes. But it came true. ‚ÄúDangerous, for a prince of ice and wind to pray to the Fire-Bringer,‚Äù she managed to say.Rowan shrugged, a secret smile on his face as he wiped away the tear that escaped down her cheek. ‚ÄúFor some reason, Mala likes me, and agreed that you and I make a formidable pair.‚ÄùOkay, I think I ranted enough now. *lol* So yeah, I hope I‚Äôll get my hands on‚ÄúQueen of Shadows‚Äùsoon and that myprecious Gemwill continue this journey with me! I even wrote nice things about Chaol!! That‚Äôs got to count! ;-P'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Ohmygosh. The Maas-ter has done it againShe was the heir of ash and fire, and she would bow to no one.This one wasso freaking good.Honestly, when was the last time that the third book in a series was just as good as the first?Celaena -deadly, battered and broken- is sent to a neighboring kingdom. She must find a way to destroy the wyrdkeys to save the kingdom (and possibly the world) from the rule of a corrupt kingdom.And then I am going to rattle the stars.Manon -ruthless, disciplined and wicked- is of the blackbeak witches. She's sent to join the corrupt king's army as a wyvern rider and manages to raise hell while doing it.There were few sounds she enjoyed more than the groans of dying men, but the wind was one of them.Chaol and Dorian -prim, proper and honestly bit boring- must deal with their ever-collapsing kingdom. From mass murder to magic mayhem, this year is going to the ultimate make-or-break for them.He would see that world reborn, even if it took his last breath. Even if he had no name now, no position or title save Oath-Breaker, Traitor, Liar.Sarah J Maas manages to weave thesethree unique storylinestogether in such an unforgettable way. I could hardly read this one fast enough. I cannot wait to get my hands on the next!P.s. Young Celaena is possibly my fave character ever.Her dearest friends are characters in books.YouTube|Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Facebook| Snapchat @miranda_reads""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Brilliant. Sarah J Maas is becoming my favourite author. Her writing style is engaging, engrossing, intelligent, and easy to follow. Her imagination and storytelling are amazing. This story is a lot slower than the Crown of Midnight; it concentrates more on the character development.At the end of the last book, we learned not only who Celaena Sardothien really is but also what she really is. Her relationship with Chaol is in tatters. Having ""suggested"" to the king to send her on a mission for her own protection and cutting Prince Dorian out of the loop, Chaol is in no man‚Äôs land. Distancing himself from Dorian, for Dorian own protection, he starts to do his job and notices some irregularities with a certain high-ranking general. This forces Chaol to make some decisions of his own, how long can a good honourable man serve a tyrant like the King of Aldarlan and his many atrocities.Dorian is more alone than he has ever been, but he does manage to find solace. Finding a company is not really difficult for a handsome prince, but who can he trust. This is triply difficult as he has to not only keep his own actives, which his father will not approve of secret, his friends secrets, and most of all, his magic.We also introduced the Iron Teeth Witch Clans and especially Manon Blackbeak. Meanwhile, Celaena detours from her mission and pursues her own agenda. Meeting forgotten and powerful relatives. Before she is allowed to get the answers she wants, she must claim her heritage (her powers). She must learn to control them and master them all the while, putting he shattered life and her past. I really like the way she has to train and relearn everything. Just because you are in a stronger body does not mean you can control it, especially in a fight situation.Great story, very character driven, and impossible to put down. I kept thinking I would just read one more chapter, flicked a few pages, and thought ok I will stop at the next section break, or that\'s a short chapter might as well as finish it. Suddenly, half a quarter of the book was gone. Despite being 550+ pages, the book just flies by. It sets up the next book excellently, including a confrontation I have been begging for since the first e-novel.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Initial Reaction: Holy crap. I can\'t breathe. Oh my god. That was epic. WHERE IS BOOK #4??Read the full review atA Perfection Called Books**This review contains spoilers from previous Throne of Glass booksAs I\'m sure you all know by now, I am obsessed with the Throne of Glass series by Sarah J Maas. I was ecstatic when Bloomsbury sent me an ARC! Picking up not long after the heart-wrenching end of Crown of Midnight, Sarah J Maas dazzles and entrances readers once more with a phenomenal third book filled with magic, character growth, sacrifice, rebellion and more.‚ÄúI wish you to become who you \xadwere born to be. To become queen.‚ÄùHeir of Fire has most definitely made my list of best books of 2014. This book is quite different from the others in the series. I liked it a bit less than the other two, but it was so different it\'s hard to compare them. The other books center around romance and action while this book deals with the deeper stuff: betrayal, confidence, mourning, rebellion, heritage, loyalty...This book is huge. It was a bit cumbersome to hold, but the content was great! The beginning was a bit slow but eventually picked up. Everything written was absolutely necessary to carry the story though, so I didn\'t mind. The attention to detail was amazing. Everything was there for a reason, there were connections to the other books all over the place! It brought back all the feels from The Assassin\'s Blade & Crown of Midnight. Sarah J Maas is so meticulous about her writing and is truly in a league of her own. The tone of the book was much darker too. Maas has set this series on a much darker (and awesome) road than most YA series (even fantasy novels) tend to go, and I applaud her for it.The high fantasy aspect of this book was amped up. There was magic and wyverns and fae! I loved it all. This series reminds me of a YA version of Game of Thrones a bit... Less sex and deaths though. The world-building was fantastic. Everything was so clearly described. I could see it all playing out in my mind.The character development in this series is fantastic. Each of our characters has his/her own obstacles that must be overcome; they all have their own journeys.‚ÄúBecause I am lost,"" she whispered onto the earth. ""And I do not know the way.‚ÄùWe see a totally different side of Celaena in Heir of Fire. We\'re used to the cocky, confident, invincible assassin. In this book we see the vulnerable, defeated, self-loathing side of her. In the end though she comes out more fierce and determined than before, a magic-wielding queen ready to take back what\'s rightfully hers.‚ÄúAs for Celaena,"" he said again, ""you do not have the right to wish she were not what she is. The only thing you have a right to do is decide whether you are her enemy or her friend.‚ÄùChaol struggles to decide where his loyalties lie and how he feels about Celaena and the discoveries he made in Crown of Midnight. I\'ll admit, Chaol annoyed me so much in this book. He redeems himself in the end though. Dorian struggles to conceal his magic and stand up to his father. Both characters come so far in this book. They sacrifice so much and in the end they make the tough decisions where this is no turning back.There are quite a few new characters introduced in this book: Rowan, the fae prince and warrior who teaches Celaena how to control her magic. Aedion, the fierce general and Celaena\'s cousin. Manon, ferocious heir to the Blackbeak witch coven. All of the characters in this book are so complex and well developed. The secondary characters are just as descriptive as well. I ALMOST ship Rowan and Celaena, but I think they\'re more of a team. He\'s so fiercely devoted and smart and honest and awesome!! Aedion is so loyal and amazing. Manon is okay, she\'s a bit too blood-thirsty...With new characters come more points of view. Overall I liked the various perspectives because the plot needed all sides of the story to make sense. Sometimes though I felt that some scenes were quite unnecessary and long and dragging.We learn so many things about Erilea and what happened to Celaena ten years ago. It\'s all quite mind-blowing and a bit overwhelming. We also learn more about the King\'s nefarious actions. We see connections all over the place from the various books! Maas has been spreading the crumbs throughout the series until BAM you read Heir of Fire, and it all comes together!! The wyrdstones. The tower. The rings. The disappearances. The crumbled note. The rebels. Baba Yellowlegs. Everything happens for a reason and contributes to the story in some way.‚ÄúThe people you love are just weapons that will be used against you.‚ÄùRomance was not a big part of this novel. There are some heartache moments for our dearest Chaolaena and a bit of romance, but there are much more important things brewing in Erilea and Wendlyn. This series is past the silly romance, it\'s moved on to the important stuff like defeating a diabolical king, bringing back magic, freeing the enslaved, and so on.As I said before, this book starts off a bit slow. Stick with it though, if you liked the other books you\'ll love this one as well. The ending is horrific yet amazing at the same time. The rebellion is forming, and we readers are kept wanting more.‚ÄúHe would see that world reborn, even if it took his last breath. Even if he had no name now, no position or title save Oath-Breaker, Traitor, Liar.‚ÄùHeir of Fire is yet another amazing installment of the Throne of Glass series. WHERE IS BOOK #4????‚ÄúShe was the heir of ash and fire, and she would bow to no one.‚ÄùPre-Reading Hyped Review:Oh Captain... I\'m waiting ;)6/21I am getting a physical ARC copy of HEIR OF FIRE.

It was touch and go for two books, but this... this didn\'t even feel like belonging to the same series anymore. Maas has fixed almost everything I didn\'t care for in the first two books, starting with Celaena\'s character, which is literally gone, to be replaced by new and improved, and more believable Aelin Galathynius. The assassin who never assassinates, or even behaves as an assassin is no more.While we still get to enjoy the three key POVs, there are some great new characters being improved in this third book, each sharing their own perspectives. The way Maas tying two or three of them at a time (may be except for Manon) for each chapter made for a little unusual, but quite an interesting reading experience. It broke the monotony of the flow of story very well in my opinion. And Manon... A fascinating new character with her own immersive thread. I was a little confused at start, but quickly came to love that particular plotline: It was new, had a lot of mystery, and continuously eventful. And then Aedion and Rowan, who were equally interesting additions to the story, and there was never a dull moment with this trio.""It was madness and joy and terror and despair and eternity.""Now that I have finished three books, I did start to see certain similarities as well. In each book, Maas took her time in the first half, maintaining a slower pace, heavily focused on character relationships while sprinkling a little bit of magic and mystery here and there. But the second halves were always much faster, eventful, and a lot more thrilling. I was too annoyed with Celaena\'s character before to clearly notice this before, but I\'m hoping it would be consistent throughout the series.Though it didn\'t make much sense, I had still found the plot of this of series intriguing from the very first book. Heir of Fire finally explains many of those mysteries we had come across before, and appeared to be setting the direction of the series. More than once, I felt this could\'ve been a better starting point to this series. Compared to where we started, the plot was also a lot more complex with in-depth world building. With 4 more books remaining, I know it\'s too early to form an overall opinion, but, it feels like things could only get better after this. This is one of the best comebacks I\'ve came across lately.""Loyalty is earned, not given.""'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""BEAUTIFUL.

Podr√≠a tirarme horas, la verdad.Me ha encantado Rowan.DE VERDAD. Me parece una especie de Celaena, un poquito m√°s oscuro, d√©spota y con menos sentimientos, pero igual de fuerte y disciplinado con un pasado traum√°tico. El t√°ndem que se genera entre Rowan y ella es de lo mejor del libro y no pod√≠a despegarme de las p√°ginas en sus escenas. Luego tenemos aManon,y descubriremos por fin m√°s sobre la magia ancestral de las brujas en este universo que nos fue introducido vagamente enCorona de medianoche. Me ha encantado ver lo diferente que ese micro-cosmos sanguinario y milenario, con la introducci√≥n de nuevas criaturas fant√°sticas y conflictos que estoy seguro dar√°n mucho que hablar en las continuaciones.Tambi√©n tenemos a Aedion, que simplemente...cheff kiss.Quiz√° no tanto por √©l en s√≠, sino todo lo que le rodea, lo que genera en cuanto a tem√°tica y lo que supone para el futuro de la historia.He de admitir que me ha costado un poco terminar este libro.Lo abandon√© un poquito m√°s hacia el final, superado el ecuador, y como siempre me pasa... me arrepent√≠. Por mucho que me fascinara Manon como personaje, sus escenas a veces eran algo repetitivas.Lo que sucede en palacio con Dorian y Chaol era entretenido pero sent√≠a que a veces renqueaba, avanzando demasiado lento.Pero bueno, que estoy hablando de un libro de Sarah J Maas. ¬°Que en verdad no tiene relleno!

She\'s been broken. Over and over and over again. And yet she still stands strong, even in the face of suffering, agony, and emotional torture. She came to Wendlyn an empty person, devoid of all joy and peace. She left Wendlyn changed. She faced her past. She learned to accept every shattered part of her.Rowan Whitethorn.Resilient, stubborn, sardonic. He\'s all sharp edges and prickly thorns, but once Celaena gets past his rough exterior, she realizes he is hurting. Just like she is. They are kindred spirits in a lonely world.Chaol Westfall.Bitter, persistent, brave. He was left in pieces when Celaena left for Wendlyn. His friendship with Dorian is in tatters, his mental health is at a low. But he carries on. He\'s the only ordinary human in a world filled with magic, and he feels his weaknesses with every step.However, he is not right for Celaena, and we all know it. He sold her out and he refused to accept every part of her. He was an essential part of her journey, but she is a different person now.""She was not becoming anything different from what she always was and always had the capacity to be. You just finally saw everything. And once you saw that other part of her..."" Dorian said quietly. ""You cannot pick and choose which parts of her to love.""Dorian Havilliard.Devoted, intelligent, determined. He\'s insightful and sensitive, always tuned to the feelings and needs of others. He\'s accepting and kind, forgiving and generous. He accepts Celaena and still treats her like a friend, understanding that she must move on.Sorscha.Kind, gentle, courageous. I hated her the first time I read this book. But this time around, I was actually quite fond of her. She\'s a quiet, brave person. Her mild infatuation with Dorian still annoys me, but I can see now that she was absolutely essential to his recovery process. She helped Dorian when he was lonely and hurting. She made a discovery about magic that was very underwhelming, but at least she actually tried to help him.Manon Blackbeak.Cruel, cold, adamant. Violent and steadfast and so gloriouslybrutal.She\'s devoted to the Thirteen before everyone else. She\'s terrifying and beautifully deadly, but she cares deeply once you get past her mask. She\'s been manipulated and molded into the killing machine that she is now, but there is a great possibility for kindness within her, and that part of her shows whenever she\'s around Abraxos.Aedion Ashryver.Clever, loyal, haunted. He\'s hot-headed and bloodthirsty, but his mind never leaves Aelin. He\'s been living a lie ever since the massacre at Terrasen, and he\'s determined to destroy Adarlan from the inside out.These characters are beautiful.They\'re flawed, but so wonderfully vibrant.They jump off the page, almost. They have personal struggles and fears, but they\'re brave and loyal and dedicated to their cause.

The rich development of the plot and the characters, the scope of the world, the side characters, the multiple POV's... Maas truly outdid herself with this book.Celaena was just phenomenal in this instalment. Her growth was astounding and I loved how this started off with her almost breaking down with grief and depression and intense self-hatred and shame. Sarah J Maas has a knack for really diving into broken characters, and as the story progressed and we found out more about Celaena‚Äôs past, I felt the weight of her sadness and responsibility with her. It was heartbreaking to read.One of the main things I‚Äôve noticed whilst rereading the series this time round is how parallel and connected each plot and each character is to one another. There‚Äôs something about that that I just love, because it not just about Celaena trying to reclaim who she is, but about how each characters struggle and success adds to the bigger picture of it all, of this world they are wanting to rebuild and the peace they‚Äôre trying to regain.Every character and their journey is adding something to the story, the overall, bigger picture.

Not only forCelaena Sardothienbut also for all of her companions and enemies.Heavy with grief,Celaenais sent on a mission byAdarlan\'s King, with the purpose of assassinating the King and Crown Prince of Wendlyn.UnlikeErilea, magic roams freely inWendlyn, a Kingdom ruled byHouse Ashryver. Located nearby isDoranellealso known asthe City of Rivers, a Fae city ruled by its Fae QueenMaeve, one of the threeFae Sister-Queens. For ages, humans, Fae and demi-Fae dwell peacefully in that land.By arriving atVarese, Wendlyn\'s Capital City and meetingRowan Whitethorn, a Fae warrior serving underQueen Maeve, Celaena must face her heritage and learn to wield the dormant magic that has been coursing through her blood from birth in exchange for the valuable knowledge Queen Maeve holds that could save her friends and Erilea.Celaena is taken toMistward, the fortress and home to the demi-Fae, and there she will train with Rowan until she masters her powers and gets the answers she\'s seeking from Queen Maeve about the Wyrdkeys.What I love mostly aboutHeir of FireisCelaena\'shealing journey and experiencing the magnitude of her grief and despair especially after the events ofCrown of Midnight. It made me wonder to what point will Celaena break to regain herself? Will she be forever haunted by the shadow of all her beloved dead?

I\'m truly yet again in awe of howSarah J Maasseamlessly managed to expand the world ofThrone of Glassbeyond what we had in the first two books. Theworld-building and the settingwas lushly atmospheric and rich in details.Theaction-sequencesfired me up and had me on the edge of my seat.Heir of Fireintroduced us to three new characters that have joined the main cast:‚Ä¢ Rowan Whitethorn: A Fae Prince and one of the six elite warriors serving under Queen Maeve.‚Ä¢ Aedion Ashryver: A General in Adarlan\'s army and cousin toAelin Ashryver Galathynius, the lost heir ofTerrasen.‚Ä¢ Manon Blackbeak: An Ironteeth Witch and Heir of the Blackbeak Witch ClanThe book is divided intomultiple POVSof: Celaena, Chaol, Dorian, Manon and Rowan.Each character gets theproper developmentneeded to push the story further which shaped the events of what is yet to come in the future.InCelaena\'schapters, I loved seeing the development between her and Rowan; feeling the intense tension between them, then seeing that dislike mellowing and turning into admiration and then witnessing that growing friendship between them turn into something much more precious, a bond sealed by the words""To Whatever End"".ThroughManon Blackbeak\'schapters, we are introduced to theWitch-clansofThe Waste. There are three main Ironteeth Witch clans:The Blackbeaks, The Yellowlegs and The Bluebloods. The Ironteeth Witches are offered to chooseWyvernsto fly into battle and become part ofKing Adarlan\'snew Aerial Legion. Manon chooses a bait wyvern and names himAbraxos, after the ancient serpent who held the world between his coils at the behest of the Three-Faced Goddess..Chaol and Dorian\'schapters give insight to the events occurring inAdarlanand the secrets that are uncovered especially the ones concerning Aelin. Dorian begins to learn more of his magic while Chaol must do what needs to be done in order to protect Dorian and his Kingdom. Also, a new romance sparks for Dorian with his healerSorchawho helped attend to his, Chaol and Celaena\'s wounds for months.I also loved thesecondary charactersthat were present in the book:Emrys, Luca, Malakai, Asterin and the brief appearance of Rowan\'s Cadre.To me,Heir of Firewas a healing book and an adventure that took me to different places at the same time. I felt the consuming rush of adrenaline through most of it, I felt the hollowness of the scenes that dealt with grief, and heart fluttered and tingled during the heartwarming scenes.I think all this points out to why I love this book the most out of all the other 7 books in the series.

Inevitably, I compared him to Rhysand in my mind and that initially made Rowan fall kind of flat... but once I pushed that away I REALLY appreciated this sweet boi for what he is. Which is: perfect for Celaena.And I think that's really where Maas succeeds. She creates beautifully flawed (and yes sometimes annoying) characters that interact SO WELL with each other. I live for the ships in her books because flaws are complemented, strong suits are contrasted, and in general I wait with bated breath for the characters to get it on.

Well, news flash- IT'S NOT!Dante(of course he's named Dante) is the MMC. He is the typical arrogant billionaire guy. The author tried to present him as someone like Tony Stark, minus the Iron Man tech but Dante just came across as an ass. Even tho he has a good backstory, there is nothing to him. His personality is as bland as plain white bread.VivianShe's supposed to be an heiress, but does she have the brains for it? Of course not. She was supposed to be Serena van der Woodsen, but she couldn't be. Although, she is much more tolerable than Dante. There's no life to her tho. Even Pinocchio who once came to life, had much more life to him.The chemistryit's non existent. The characters see each other for the first time and Vivian feels it in her coochie and Dante's cock starts having a stroke. This is like 10 pages in to the book. Idk how many of you know this but I can't stand insta lust/love especially when it's not written well.The way it's written is so Wattpad.I know that Ana Huang is a very distinguished author and has immense talent (from what I hear) but this was my first book I read of hers and I'm SO SO SOOOO DISAPPOINTED. I don't think I can get over the cliche dialogues she wrote. It's over the top cheesy and absolutely unrealistic, even for a fictional world.I have the Twisted series on my physical TBR, and I honestly don't see myself reading it anytime soon.

Since I have no idea what my thoughts are exactly lmao.At first I was going to give the book 2‚ú∞, since it bored me at several points and because I think Ana Huang has found a formula that is successful and sells books and she is sticking to it. If someone had told me that I was reading the fifth book in thetwisted series,I would believe it 100%. There is nothing new despite being a new series, I understand that she uses characters from previous series to attract the readers, but with at least notable differences from the previous series lol. I understand that, since Dante and Vivian are the main characters, it was difficult to separate it from the Twisted saga, but wow, at least a little bit of novelty since the Kings of Sin series is going to have 7!!!!!! Books!!!.‚òÑ. *. ‚ãÜœÅ‚ÑìœÉ—Ç:We follow the story ofDante Russo,CEO (like most of Ana Huang's men) andVivian Lau,event planner of a prestigious company and daughter of Francis Lau. Our story begins when it is announced to Vivian that she is going to have to marry Dante Russo for business reasons (not gonna lie i love a Good arranged marriage). What Vivian does not know is that Dante is being blackmailed by her father, and that is why he has agreed to marry her. While Vivian tries to fulfill her duty, Dante tries to find a way to break the agreement without being harmed.‚òÑ. *. ‚ãÜœÅŒ±ùñºùñæ Œ±êì£·ëØ œâùóãùóÇùóçùóÇêì£ùóÄ :Like all of Ana Huang's books, they are very simple and quick to read, but I do have to admit that for such a short book, it seemed a little long, and the truth is that I couldn't explain why, maybe just I wasn't in the mood.‚òÑ. *. ‚ãÜùñº…¶Œ±ùóãŒ±ùñºùóçùñæùóãùóå :‡≥É‚ÅÄ‚û∑ ùììùì™ùì∑ùìΩùìÆ ùì°ùìæùìºùìºùì∏:OK. I must admit, he is my favorite of all the guys I have read written by Ana Huang, but, once again, it is not new, once again, he remains in the same formula of a possessive, authoritarian man, with money and physically perfect . The only real novelty was him being Italian which added a lot of spice to it!. That was kind of hot!! His evolution during the book is as expected:I don't want anything with anyone, I'm grumpy, I'm a man, I'm horny, No one touches what's mine, I fuck up, suddenly realize I have the iq of a brick and that I loved the girl all along. Clap clap clap!!!‚ÄúYou are fucking perfect the way you are Vivian. If your parents can't see that, then it's their loss‚Äù‚ÄúSe sapessi il potere che hai su di me‚Äù‚ÄúGive me time, mia cara.

I really liked her evolution as a character, although she was a strong and determined woman, not afraid to put Dante in his place from the beginning, her fear of not meeting her parents' expectations and of disappointing or disobeying them made her very inhibited. I'm not going to say much about that topic since it would be a spoiler, but I will just say that its evolution was very good.‚ÄúMost engagement rings were a symbol of love and commitment.

Like the scene where Dante fingers her on the library was so uncalled for lmao, he just literally touches her and Vivian is instantly wet for him like‚Ä¶ what kind of sprinkle do these girls have. ANYWAYS, sorry for the explicit rant but im like, a little bit tired.The third act conflict, this will contain spoilers so feel free to also skip it:I have to say that for the first time, the breakup was not ridiculous, since it is understandable that Vivian was angry and did not want to know anything about Dante and I also liked the reconciliation, it was not rushed and made more sense.I really liked being able to see the twisted lies scenes from Vivian and Dante's point of view and I have to admit that Dante Russo and his planned dates conquered me.Obviously I will continue reading Ana Huang because even though her books don't seem like the best things in the world to me, they are addictive lol.‚òÑ. *. ‚ãÜùò¥ùò∞ùòÆùò¶ ùò≤ùò∂ùò∞ùòµùò¶ùò¥ ùò™ ùò¶ùòØùò´ùò∞ùò∫ùò¶ùò• :‚Äú‚ÄîSeparate rooms until marriage. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt realize you were such a traditionalist‚Äù ‚Äú‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt realize you were so eager to share a bed with me‚Äù‚ÄúDante held me. ‚ÄúAll I knew was, the icy aftermath of the robbery, his voice and embrace were the only things keeping me warm.‚Äù‚Äú ‚Äì My kiss. ‚ÄúOne kiss for each of my injuries‚Äù ‚Äú‚ÄîBetter?‚Äù ‚Äú‚ÄîMuch‚Äù‚Äú‚ÄîYou take the most ordinary or unexpected things and make them extraordinary. ‚ÄúYou see the silver lining in every situation and the good in everyone, even if they don‚Äôt deserve it.‚Äù‚ÄúVivian once told me about a Chinese proverb that said an invisible thread connected those destined to meet, regardless of time, place or circumstance.

Nothing beats that feeling I'm sorry.Let me preface this by saying, in no way am I a hater of Ana Huang and her writing. I simply tried reading her Twisted Series and hated the first book. Ugh, it was such a disappointed (and I expected to lovelove it). Sounds a bit like a me problem.Let's stop rambling and talk about KING OF WRATH.Since y‚Äôall know what this is about (probably better than me), I won‚Äôt summarize the plot.OVERALL THOUGHTS This book had was strong from page 1, chapter 1. I feel like Ana improved in her storytelling skills A LOT and that‚Äôs something we always love to see. My main problem with Twisted Love was the amount of PURE CRINGE I felt while reading it. I expected to cringe reading this as well, but boy was I wrong (I did like two times, but c‚Äômon, it‚Äôs romance, that‚Äôs practically an imperative). Chapters were dual POV, nothing new, BUT, we had those chapters with both Vivian and Dante and those were so great. Their length was just perfect, and I read the totality od this book while taking study breaks. Just amazing! I would still consider this a lighthearted read, but, we also dealt with some pretty important topics. These millionaire romance books don‚Äôt often include ‚Äúnew wealth‚Äù. Yes, admit it to yourself, all your fav millionaire men come from generations of wealth. It was amazing how we got to experience this big change in a character‚Äôs societal status through Vivian. I also like the dynamic between our main characters, they shared so many cute moments which I enjoyed way more than the banter and smut. Them bonding over breakfast and weird snacks was so wholesome. Side characters were all great !!! (esp Kai ohhh lord that mannnnn). It‚Äôs pretty visible how Ana Huang introduced us to a whole bunch of potential leads of future books (this will be a 7 book series if I‚Äôm well informed). Also, I‚Äôm under the impression that this series is set in the same world as the Twisted series, since some characters made an appearance and some locations were mentioned. I feel like I would really enjoy that if I finished the Twisted Series (maybe someday who knows), SO TWISTED FANS WILL LOVE THIS.VIVIAN I love this woman so much. She‚Äôs a woman of class and behavior! She deals with problems in her life with so much class, I envy her manners. At the same time, she‚Äôs this badass strong independent woman, sometimes impulsive and headstrong in her ideas. BUT ALSO, she‚Äôs not afraid to show EMOTION (both love and disapproval). The way she stood up to people who tried to put her down, APPLAUSE! I also lovelove the way her physical appearance was described in her but esp Dante‚Äôs chapters. Such a good protagonist, will she be a fav from this series?? (can I calm down)DANTE He is the reason I gave this book 4 and not five stars. Yeah, gotta admit, I‚Äôm not Dante‚Äôs biggest fan. I don‚Äôt often fall for men in books that easily (is this a me problem again lol), I don‚Äôt normally like the big possessive jealous ((alpha)) man. He was that type (in his core, not that much). Yes, he gave me the ick a few times. BUT, I love him with Vivian so much. I love how he gave up on his headstrong and impulsive characteristics for her. You could really see him learn to love her STEP BY STEP. CHEF‚ÄôS KISSSPICE is something I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of when it comes to Ana Huang. She writes cute moments much better in my opinion, BUT in this one, those scenes were much much better than in Twisted Love (I keep comparing those SORRY). The limo scene had me on my knees, if you‚Äôre thinking about reading this, read it for that scene plsplsYeah, that‚Äôs it. I can‚Äôt wait to read about Isabella and Kai (I KNOW THEY‚ÄôRE GONNA DELIVER,,,, c‚Äômon a man with glasses and a british accent and this hothothot woman).

But I needed it a little longer and stronger).The smut, whether you read it or skip it, just takes you out of the emotional state you were in bc, obviously, it brings up a different vibe.‚Üí There was less smut than in her other books what I personally really liked.

I'll leave it up to you if that's a good or bad thing.I'm being lazy when it comes to reviews, but here are some thoughts to put my two braincells to use:‚Äî I liked Vivian (except when she was in front of her parents, but that's maybe because I don't understand that kind of upbringing and I've never been there, and so I especially celebrated when she finally decided to talk back to her father).‚ÄîDanteChristian AlexRusso... those millions mean nothing if you can't buy a good personality with it!! I'm honestly a little disappointed that all these billionaires club characters are just copies of each other, and don't have a single original thought,like what in the LJShen is this??‚Äî Nowthe romance wasn't bad, but it could use a little work.I liked all those romantic gestures and small details between them, but the time jumps and gaps with Dante on so many business trips made it hard for me to think that there was anything more than an bussines arrangement between them.‚Äî Thisvalhalla club... I had so many BIGGER expectations about it!! You could have gotten the same result with an overpaid tennis club.‚Äî Miss Ana, I'm begging you to come up with another RhrysBridget or JoshJules,I'M BEGGING YOU WOMAN!!!I don't know what kind of crack you put in them, but those books are something else and I need you to go back to it.‚Äî Bonus points for mentioning my shitty country TWICE. That was honestly the most surprising thing about this whole story.This review sounds a bit like I didn't enjoy the book, but actually I used my one day off to read it in one sitting and I really got hooked, I just expected better, not so repetitive.Just to finish and clarify I wanna say that YES, I KNOW THAT MAGDA IS A PAINTING!! I actually think someone made me realize it the day after the previous review, AND I SAID IT, so besties please stopppp I just didn't delete it because I'm lazy lol---------------------------------------------yes I KNOW she just announced this series but i already have some ideas about possible characters!! this is definitelyDante Russo's bookbecausebillionaire and CEO of a luxury conglomerate, duh. but what about the football player (can't remember his name) in twisted games and twisted hate, is he a possible candidate for this series too? and Magda? i don't know who she is but Christian was in charge of her and set her up with bodyguards but she went missing with no clues... i feel like she could be a main character too!! ok, that's enough of a gut feelings dump for today i think""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""LOVED IT!! This is probably my new favorite Ana Huang book. King of Wrath is hot and fantastic and I could nottt stop reading it. It's got an arranged engagement/marriage!!! AND it's such a good enemies to lovers romance too. Dante and Vivian hate each other (which you might've gotten from Twisted Lies), but they've been forced into an engagement neither of them wants. He's being blackmailed by her father and she's agreed out of duty to her parents. She moves into his house for the engagement, they have to pretend to be lovey-dovey to the public, and SPARKS FLY.During this year-long engagement, Dante works (with Christian) to do everything he can to get rid of the blackmail and destroy Vivian's father... all the while slowly, reluctantly falling for his fianc√©e. The romance was so much fun to read\xa0‚Äì\xa0the way these two opened up to each other, connected over their pasts, helped each other with the little things, and FINALLY fell into bed together was well-written and perfectly paced.There's also two of my favorite things here: a jealous, possessive hero, and GROVELING! A beautiful combination, if I do say so myself. The groveling wasn't quite to the extent of Twisted Love lol but I still loved to see it.If you're a fan of the Twisted series, you won't be disappointed with King of Wrath.

One time in the summer I was hanging out in my back yard, doing whatever tf I did back then, when I saw my neighbour, bless him, carving fruit. This was an old man btw and I kid you not he would carve out different shapes and shit out of his little fruit, like one was a flower, one was like a little bear ... I swear to god I felt more emotions watching him do that, then I did reading this books.*‡≥É‡ºÑ Now lookthe plotactually had potential to be very interesting and dramatic. It revolves around Vivian, a heiress to a billion dollar company or smthing who's family have very high expectations of her. One expectation that they have is to marry the arrogant, old money billionaire Dante Russo which she agrees to do out of duty and obligation. What she doesn't know is that Dante is desperate to discover Vivian's father's dirty secrets, and whilst she's falling for him he's just using her as a pawn for his ulterior motive.*‡≥É‡ºÑ This shit could've easily been sooo dramatic with murder, politics, lies, deceit but nooooo Ana Huang just had to write this shit to be as boring and stale as mouldy, white bread! GOD WHY CAN'T DARK ROMANCE AUTHORS FOCUS ON THE PLOT DEVELOPING AS WELL HUH?!?!! Like these motherfuckers should be bringing on thedramatics, the genre lets you write about soo much as well, hand over the THREATRICS isn't that what rich people are good at?! GIVE ME AFFAIRS, TAX EVASION, EXPLOITATION! GIVE ME SCHEAMING, ROBBING BANKS FUCKING PONZI SCHEMES, GOD JUST GIVE ME MORE THAN THIS SHIT!The author could've written me 'Elite' level drama for this story, angst, pining, sexual tension, waay more planned out betrayals - instead it's like if 'Dhar Mann' directed a 2012 Wattpad story.*‡≥É‡ºÑVivian Lau,girls a NYC heiress and instead of giving 'Blair Waldorf', she's boring, old 'Venessa'. I could not tell you one meaningful personality trait that she has except for the fact that she loves her family; that's not a character arc, we all do that. This girl cannot properly communicate for shit and has very bad decision making skills (lowkey me too), like if you're in a shop being robbed my armed men, get the fuck down like you're told, 9/10 times they only want the stuff not you.I wish she was written with more depth because I felt no fucking connection with her at all, I just did not care about any of her issues or problems, she felt like some random stranger who's conversations I'm eavesdropping on in the bus. A good story would make it feel as though the MC is a very close bsf, and I didn't feel that with Vivian at all.But yk what? I can't hate her because I imagined her to be very beautiful in my head which is why I rated his higher than it should be. I guess pretty privilege wins again.*‡≥É‡ºÑ A potato actually has more disposition and depth thanDante Russo.He was lowkey hot though, but that doesn't matter when the rubber duck sitting on my desk could hold a more meaningful conversation. If money means being a boring old bitch than strip me of my material wealth, for I'd rather live with my character and charm.*‡≥É‡ºÑ I won't lie, there's more sexual tension between me and eating my sister's hazelnut chocolate croissant, than there is between the main couple. Sorry this should've been a slow burn, with pining, lots and lots of mutual longing and not even a meaningful (not fake) handhold until like the 400 page mark. Urgh authors cannot write good sexual tension anymore, I'm gonna have to rewatch Bridgerton Season 2 to feel better.*‡≥É‡ºÑ I did not care about any of the supporting characters. I totally forgot that Christian Harper even had a book until like 75% into the story.*‡≥É‡ºÑMy thoughts on if they stay together?I think they do stay married and have two children. However eventually they both lowkey settle and it's not a happy marriage, but also not particularly bad. They def both go to bed thinking about when their relationship had passion, love, lust and they end up always longing for more. They don't break up though because they're so used to each other. And if they do have an affair, it's a one time thing and definitely nothing emotional.‚ú¶ It wasn't too bad, it's just so so basic and had a lot more potential.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""If I had to rate this book on a scale of 1 to 10 based on how much I enjoyed it, it would a solid 8.I don't know what's happening but lately, books are just not working out for me üòî Not a single book, no matter the genre.

It‚Äôs one of my favorites tropes and Hannah does that so well.Russ is absolutely obsessed with Aurora, but I felt like her immaturity really held this one back for me.

I must admit that while I thoroughly enjoyed reading Hannah Grace's Icebreaker, this book surpassed my expectations and became an instant favorite. Even the cover is irresistibly cute! Returning to Maple Hills feels like coming home, and I eagerly anticipate catching glimpses of my beloved characters, playing a guessing game as to who will take the lead in the next installment (I constantly debate between JJ and Steve).What sets this book apart is the remarkable chemistry between Russ and Rory, who are truly meant for each other. Both characters carry the weight of their family issues, particularly those related to their fathers. The contrasting ways in which they cope with their problems are artfully portrayed, with Rory's directness and willingness to express her frustrations juxtaposed against Russ's tendency to bury his feelings behind self-erected walls. Yet, they find solace and support in each other, gradually unburdening themselves of their past and forging a deep connection. I wanted nothing more than to wrap these endearing characters in a warm embrace. They are refreshingly authentic, displaying vulnerability beneath their tough exteriors and demonstrating maturity in tackling their challenges while cautiously allowing their hearts to open, despite the risk of getting hurt.The story of Aurora, or Rory as she's affectionately known, and Russ unfolds at a campus party, reminiscent of the first installment. Rory attends the party at the insistence of her best friend Emilia, lured by the promise of veggie pizza. Little did she expect to encounter the introverted yet charismatic Russ Callaghan, a man of few words, who captivates her. After a night of revelry, including a playful game and an intimate lap dance, Rory abruptly retreats, convinced that Russ's prolonged absence from the bathroom indicates disinterest. Unbeknownst to her, Russ believes he's out of her league and resigns himself to her sudden departure.Fate, however, reunites them at the same summer camp, where they coincidentally find themselves working as counselors, seeking respite from their respective family troubles. As they discover their shared workplace, their already complicated connection intensifies. Compounded by the camp's strict policy against fraternization, Russ becomes even more hesitant, fearing the consequences of jeopardizing his job. Nonetheless, the magnetic attraction between him and Rory becomes irresistible, fueling their desire to explore the undeniable chemistry that binds them.Rory carries the weight of her mother's incessant complaints and guilt trips following her parents' divorce, while her father chooses to ignore her existence. She also grapples with an estranged relationship with her older sister, who resides overseas. On the other hand, Russ faces financial hardships stemming from his father's gambling addiction. Pressure mounts as his father continually requests money, and when Russ refuses, he faces verbal abuse. He is frustrated by his mother's constant justifications for his father's behavior and his brother's insistence that he prioritize family time despite being the one on tour with his band.Their relationship may have begun with a passionate night, but I relished the gradual development of their connection. The slow burn progression, the strengthening of their friendship, and their shared vulnerability allowed them to shed their emotional barriers and learn to trust one another. What truly captivated me was the absence of unnecessary immaturity or exaggerated drama. Instead, the story presented two individuals navigating their complex circumstances with maturity, drawing strength from each other.I cherished the personal growth of these characters as they navigated their way through their dysfunctional families, always supporting one another unconditionally and offering a safe haven amidst the chaos. Witnessing their journey was a joy, as they discovered their own paths while building bridges with their loved ones.Overall, this book has firmly secured its place as my favorite in the series, leaving me eagerly anticipating future installments set in the enchanting world of Maple Hills. The author, Hannah Grace, has once again demonstrated her talent for crafting compelling stories filled with relatable characters and heartfelt emotions.I extend my heartfelt gratitude to NetGalley and Atria Books for providing me with the opportunity to read and review this swoon-worthy book. Their generosity in sharing the digital reviewer copy in exchange for my honest thoughts is sincerely appreciated.

Hannah Grace calls herself a ""fluffy comfort book"" author, so that\'s the lens I\'m reviewing it through. If you read this and dissected it like you would a book about genocide, you\'re doing yourself a disservice. This book\'s objective is clearly to put a cheesy smile on your face and let you escape from the very real cost of living crisis and the fact pumpkin-flavoured Philadelphia cream cheese is nearly $10 at your local grocery store.I\'ve never readIcebreakerso I can\'t compare the two but the streets seem to think Icebreakers is better. If you\'re looking for a slow burn, keep on looking. This is on-demand hot water. Homegirl has three orgasms in the first 10% of the book. Which leads me to my next point... I know this is suppose to be fluffy and comforting, but it felt like an inexperienced 16-year-old boy wrote the sex scenes. Can we stop pretending that finishing MULTIPLE times in one session and from straight penetration is a REGULAR occurrence in big ole 2023? The spice was the equivalent of black pepper IMO. I just didn\'t feel any tension other than Aurora going OH EM GEE HE\'S SOOO SEXY!!! And I can\'t buy into that he was saying all sorts of filthy stuff but got a boner while hugging her and had to psyche himself up in the mirror to talk to her like Bruce Willis from that one Friends episode.Other than that, this was fine. She did throw in some serious issues like alcoholism, gambling, and bum ass fathers. There\'s NO third-act breakup (sorry not sorry for the spoiler) which is great. There even were some funny moments (the possum scene...) Also, I highly recommend reading with your eyeballs; I had the ALC from Libro.fm but the narrators sounded so childish and somehow cheapened the book lol. If you want to read this, go ahead, but don\'t feel inspired to just because of my review haha. This won\'t blow your mind. If you want a fluffy, comfort read and don\'t mind closed door vibes, I strongly recommend anything from Lindsey Kelk.PROS AND CONSPros: some funny moments, light-hearted but does cover some serious topics with empathy, quick read, no third-act breakup, limited miscommunicationCons: did her mom actually steal someone\'s cat???? if so, that\'s absolutely fked LOL, no tension, spice was uninspired (at least no dry humping though), limited banter, pretty much insta-love___Check outmy YouTubeandmy TikTok'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '1.5‚òÖwildfire? more likedumpster firenow who are y\'all\'s drug suppliers? asking for a friend...Àö‚ú© ‚ãÜÔΩ°Àö ‚ú©so remember how (7 months ago) i said that there was a review coming? yeah i lied. but i also want to reduce the number of books on my rtc shelf so here we are. i also remember practically nothing about this book because as it turns out, dealing with the consequences of my procrastination is not fun. who knew!?so instead of anactualreview where i rant about all the ways this book is an abomination to the world of fiction, how it physically pains me to even think about this monstrosity, and how i would rather be pierced through the eyeballs than ever read this shit again, i\'m just going to go off on a tangent about nothing and everything at the same time. which, you know, isn‚Äôt really all that different from my other reviews.to begin with, i should probably mention that this was not a hate read. i did genuinely plan on liking this book because i had heard some really good things about it, and i was told it was a step up from icebreaker.i read the entirety of this book and 5 chapters of icebreaker, and i can confirm that they were both equally as bad.exhibit a. - their page counts. does a contemporary romance really have to be so long? no. the answer is no. always has and always will be.exhibit b. - their characters. i was there for barely any time when i knew i would not be liking stassie, and the same goes for rory. nate and whatever the fuck this guys name was, felt like every other mmc, and they just felt bland and boring, and any depth they had felt forced.exhibit c. - their excessive amounts of characters. i cannot tell you how many characters there are, mainly because it felt as though i met a new one every other page or so. i wouldn‚Äôt even mind that much if there was any depth and personality to them but noooo. they‚Äôre all like the crust on your bread.exhibit d. - okay i originally had another point here (i promise) but then i ended up taking a bunch of personality quizzes because i felt that spending too much time on this shitty book would destroy what\'s left of my mental health. anyhoo, it turns out i‚Äôm intj/entj, a slytherin, an enneagram type 8, i\'m on the aquarius/pisces cusp, if i was a disney princess i would be jasmine and my albums are evermore and ultraviolenceokay back to this book that makes wattpad look like a literary masterpiece. this is also my official apology to wattpad: i am so sorry i‚Äôve compared you to so!!many!!terrible!!books!! please accept my sincere apologies.anyway ‚Äúforbidden romance‚Äù my ass. it\'s fucking summer camp okay, no one gives a shit about who\'s sleeping with who.okay i hate this book. please understand how much i hate this book. i don‚Äôt remember this book, but i do hate this book. but i remember the daddy issues. god, there were so many daddy issues. is it the new trendy thing to add in your romance books?? i can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs a step up or down from fae smut.alright back to me. according to einstein, \'insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. \' and i have read a hannah grace book twice and expected different results.ITS ME!

I really loved her for that.Also she was so damn relatable like:""Why are you so cute?""We both had the same first impression of Russ.And like this one\'s just self explanatory:""The english major in me cringes at the cracked spine and folded page corners""Then we have Russ (muffin) Callaghan. Lemme tell you he was teh sweetest cinnamon roll ever and muffin as a nickname was so cute. Don\'t get me wrong I love bad boys and all but Russ really changed my perspective on that because he was so damn cute and caring and I loved how kind and loving he was. Not him pouring while being grumpy. He was so shy and anxious around aurora like this one scene where Aurora asks him for a secret to which he says:‚ÄúYou make me nervous,‚Äù he says eventually, immediately taking a swig of his beer.‚ÄúThat isn‚Äôt a secret,‚Äù I laugh. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs very obvious.‚ÄùAlso another plus point, that guy has DIMPLES.

They all are green flags with the most caring, respectful and selfless personality.This was the cutest book and definitely better thanIcebreaker! I mean what are the chances that two people who have daddy issues fall in love with each other? That\'s exactly what Russ and Aurora are. I love them and they are just so cute and adorable in this book and I adored each and every moments of them together even though the plot was a bit boring. I loved the confident girl x shy boy trope! Like you all I did not expected to blush everytime Russ was blushing. If someone who can make me like insta love/lust it\'s Hannah Grace.‚ÄúWell, green is my favorite color.‚Äù‚ÄúWhat type of green? Ogre green?‚Äù‚ÄúWhatever shade your eyes are.‚ÄùAurora and Russ are two broken people with daddy issues and they found each other exactly the moment they needed someone who could hold them and accept them and want them as who they were. It was beautiful to watch them grow together and help each other with their insecurities. The way Russ made sure that Rory felt wanted and loved and the way Rory made him realised that he did not need to hide his real self and she will accept him as who he is. The are the epitome of ""I can fix her/him"" trope and they did fixed each other lol. I also loved how they both refuse to be the misscommunicators in their relationship. That\'s what we call healthy relationship! Russ and Aurora maybe different because of their personality but they are also so similar when it comes to their insecurities and fears and that\'s what makes them even more perfect.‚ÄúIf you could go back in time and change something, what would you change?‚Äù‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù‚ÄúNothing?

What I most loved about her is that once she got comfortable with Russ she tried her best to share her feelings and her insecurities with him and not only.‚ÄúWhat if we get caught in the rain?

He may be a shy man who keeps to himself and gets pink ears everytime Aurora says something flirty to him but he\'s also a confident man once he knows what he wants in his life. The way he made Aurora felt seen and loved made me love him even more.‚ÄúYou‚Äôre like sunlight, Rory. I want to bask in everything you have.‚ÄùThe endingwas good with no third act breakup and misscommunication! I never expected Russ\'s dad to become better for his son but atleast he\'s doing better and even treated Rory as his own daughter.

She‚Äôs used to online death threats in the wake of her viral true-crime podcast, but she can‚Äôt help noticing an anonymous person who keeps asking her: Who will look for you when you‚Äôre the one who disappears?Soon the threats escalate and Pip realizes that someone is following her in real life. When she starts to find connections between her stalker and a local serial killer caught six years ago, she wonders if maybe the wrong man is behind bars.Police refuse to act, so Pip has only one choice: find the suspect herself‚Äîor be the next victim. As the deadly game plays out, Pip discovers that everything in her small town is coming full circle... and if she doesn‚Äôt find the answers, this time she will be the one who disappears...","[{'rating': 1, 'content': 'Ludicrous. Absolutely fricking ludicrous.I have never been more furious at a book. My hands are shaking in anger right now as I am writing this.Prepare for a hell of a rant.As most people will know, A Good Girl‚Äôs Guide to Murder has been my favourite book of all time ever since its release. I am never done recommending it to people and talking praise about it. Jackson‚Äôs writing was so well thought out, so thoroughly planned, it was beyond impressive. I related to Pip so much as a character, and found the plot line and writing style absolutely phenomenal.Because of this, it is pretty understandable that I was SUPER hyped for this release. I have had it preordered for two months, had the release date written in all of my calendars and diaries and counted down the days with friends and family.If I had known what I was getting hyped for, I wouldn‚Äôt have wasted my time.I‚Äôm not sure I have ever hated a book as much.If you love the characters, the ‚Äòwhodunnit‚Äô style and overall the first two AGGGTM novels, I must ask that you NEVER DARE pick up or even go remotely near a copy of this book.**MASS SPOILERS Ahead**It began okay. I wasn‚Äôt immensely intrigued to begin with, the writing a little repetitive and out of character, but I found it fine as I understand what Pip had been through after Stanley‚Äôs death and that she was obviously really struggling with PTSD, though her coping mechanisms were not AT ALL what I expected of her.Then, it got good. It got good really quickly from there. Although I easily guessed who the DT Killer was (something I have never once done before with one of Jackson‚Äôs book), I was completely engrossed. All of the links tying him to the other novels proved just how much thought had gone into everything and I was very impressed. I was also completely on edge reading the scenes where he was near, such as the later stick figure scenes, Pip‚Äôs speakers sounding in the middle of the night and the printer going off as well.I must say that I disliked the fact that she still seemed to like Charlie, even after all of the PTSD Stanley‚Äôs death caused her and how much she was protesting him committing the act at the time. It was not a display of the Pippa Fitz-Amobi I knew.And then came the twist. The mass plot twist around half way through that completely ruined my bookish LIFE for the past few years. Killed all of my love for Pip and the series.SHE MURDERED HIM! SHE ACTUALLY FRICKING KILLED HIM WITH A HAMMER DESPITE GETTING AWAY!I must admit, the kidnapping scene happened not where I thought it would in the book, and her managing to escape was quite far fetched, but I was still rather enjoying it nonetheless at that point. Although I do strongly believe that the Pip I know (or thought I knew) would have guessed him the instant she read Andie‚Äôs email, but here we are.BUT THEN SHE KILLED HIM!And from there, it only got worse, with Ravi helping to clear up the scene, and then them involving Cara, Naomi, Jamie, Connor and Nat, establishing alibis together and FRAMING MAX FOR JASON BELL‚ÄôS MURDER!I have never liked Max. I didn‚Äôt like him initially, I hated him when I found out he was a serial rapist and I despised him when his verdict was ‚Äònot guilty‚Äô.BUT FRAMING HIM FOR MURDER, PIP? WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL?!?!?!The nice, extremely intelligent Pippa Fitz-Amobi that I admired, related to and ABSOLUTELY ADORED as a character, MURDERED SOMEONE AND FRAMED SOMEONE ELSE FOR IT!!! I will never see her in the same way again. I will never get the lovable young detective from Little Kilton back.And Ravi and the others still sticking by her side when they knew she was a murderer? Another instance for ‚Äòwhat the actual frick?!‚Äô. I understand that the others didn‚Äôt know for sure, but who wouldn‚Äôt have guessed that?! I honestly could not believe it.The framing was ridiculous, with the changing of the Rigor and Livor Mortis with a car air con and miraculously removing all of Pip‚Äôs DNA from the crime scene. And her kind, protective parents not bothering to ask or be curious about her strange behaviours or the BIG CUT/SCAB ON HER FACE just makes no sense whatsoever! Breaking into Max‚Äôs house, drugging him, stealing his phone and clothes and taking some DNA to sprinkle at the scene? HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? HOW IS THAT HUMANLY POSSIBLE?!Things I also don‚Äôt understand is how there were no traces of Ravi left at the crime scene and how Hawkins believed his headphones story, or why he even used it in the first place! Then, Pip at Cambridge can miraculously sleep after murdering someone BUT COULDN‚ÄôT FOR MONTHS AND HAD TO TAKE DRUGS TO HELP HER AFTER SEEING STANLEY DIE?! She seems FAR more phased by his death that Jason‚Äôs, which makes literally no sense, not to mention super out of character!Then disconnecting completely from her family, severing all ties with her friends and Ravi... a) it‚Äôs just not Pip and b) wouldn‚Äôt that be even more suspicious to the police? This girl who adores her friends and family suddenly severing all ties? Come on!!I cannot believe it. I want to scream and cry and destroy that book in every way physically possible.Please do not read this book. Please do not ruin the most perfect series for yourself.It‚Äôs not worth it. I‚Äôll never see it the same again.Jackson, what have you done?'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Is it normal for one person to have this many enemies?To be fair, this book wasn't bad. But up till now, this has been my favorite YA mystery series for very specific reasons. And unfortunately, I feel like this last book in the trilogy completely jumped the shark.One of the reasons I adore this series is because of Pip. She's smart, fearless, and snarky, the perfect rendition of a modern-day Nancy Drew. But not in this book. In this book, she is angry and traumatized, and has turned into my least-favorite trope of all time: a pill-popping, freaking out, paranoid, therapy-is-not-for-me female narrator.Of course she's traumatized by what happened to her in the last two books. Who wouldn't be, if this was real life? But I don't always want darker and grittier and more realistic in everything I read. One of the main reasons I escape into books is to take comfort in strong characters who can kick ass again and again, rising from the ashes no matter what happens to them. So the fact that this book shat all over its strong female character is a huge disappointment.My other problem is the mystery, or lack thereof. In books 1 and 2, we follow Pip as she investigates, talks to suspects, gathers clues, and makes deductions. In other words, your standard Nancy Drew brought to life. But in this book, the mystery is just a small subset of the whole story, and it is over quickly, with barely any detecting.So what is this story taken up with? Well, the first 100 pages is devoted to Pip raging and popping pills. Then we mercifully get into the core mystery of this book, but that's wrapped up pretty quickly by the end of Part I. At that point, the book takes a turn in a direction I don't even recognize for this series and its characters. It is so out of left field that I was just stunned (and not in a good way).And to make matters worse, the entirety of Part II is obvious. It's clear what is going to happen, and the book just takes 200 pages to spell it out in long form. I don't have to have surprise after surprise in my books, but I'm not a fan of reading hundreds of pages when things can only go one way.Also, at the risk of sounding like an old fogey, I don't think this book is YA-appropriate. Books 1 and 2 were Young Adult, yes, but not this book. The fact that Pip skulks around and procures drugs from the neighborhood drug dealer, then inhales said drugs in order to take the edge off her trauma, not to mention what happens in the second half of the book, makes this one of the darkest books I have ever read, not just in YA.If you're thinking about reading this series, I still recommend it, especially books 1 and 2. Thankfully, each book is self-contained, with a mystery that's all wrapped up by the end. Each subsequent book does reference what happens in earlier ones, so read them in order for maximum spoiler-free enjoyment.If the other two books in this series didn't exist, I'm sure I would have enjoyed this and found very little cause for complaint. But they do, and I can't just erase them from my mind. I fell in love with the Pip and the mysteries of those books, so in comparison, this book was a shock and a disappointment.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:#1.A Good Girl's Guide to Murder#2.Good Girl, Bad Blood~~~~~~~~~~~~‚úßConnect with me‚úßInstagram‚úß""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '""Pip\'s gut twisted with guilt; this was all her fault. Her family forced into a performance, trying twice as hard with her because she could barely try at all.""No one is more disappointed than I am that this book didn\'t speak to me the way I thought it would. I\'m about as invested in this series as a reader can be; I wrote the Book of the Month recommendation for their website for the first book and blurbed several marketing materials for the second, so I thought it would be an easy 5 stars once I picked up the third book and could wrap the series up with a neat little bow. Pip, her family, and her friends feel like family to me, and stepping into their world felt like a second home. The witty banter between our leading lady and Ravi sustains me in a way that few fictional couples can manage, and while I appreciate the darker turn that the end of book 2 made, I still feel like this one went in a direction that undermines the foundation of who these characters are in the first 2/3 of the series.The first half of this book is a slow burn, which I actually appreciated. Pip is really struggling with PTSD after the events of the ending from book 2, and she\'s developed a pill problem as a coping mechanism. We receive a lot of insight into her damaged psyche, and how it\'s deteriorated her relationships between her family, her friends, and even Ravi. I was on board for all of this and the deep development we get to see, and I didn\'t really start having issues with the book until around the halfway mark.If you\'ve read any other reviews, you\'ve likely seen that there is a major twist around the halfway mark, and it\'s not the revelation of the identity to the serial killer being discussed. I think most of us figured that out pretty early on, but what is shocking isthe fact that Pip murders Jason Bell after she\'s already escaped his kidnapping her, in a really brutal manner.. From this point on, there is a significant change in the tone and vibe of the book, and it splits majorly from what we know of our characters and their fundamental morals and beliefs. Not only does the above spoiler happen, but the rest of the book is basicallyPip wrangling Ravi and her friends into covering up her involvement, hiding the body, and framing Max for a murder he did not commit, which IMO is not tit for tat regarding the rape he was exonerated from. Oh yes, and then Pip basically cuts herself off from everyone she knows and loves. The end.This will definitely be a controversial installment, and if you\'re a big fan of the first two books, I\'m struggling with recommending this final story and letting you just preserve your experience via the first two. Either way, I applaud the author for covering some difficult topics, and respect her decision to finish out this series in the way she envisioned it. I will definitely be reading more from Holly Jackson in the future.*Many thanks to the publisher for providing my review copy.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Hell no! No freaking way!

There's so much more story that could be told. I'm hoping she pulls a Maureen Johnson, a laThe Box in the Woods.By this point in the series, y'all know, Pip has been through it. This isn't a cozy YA Mystery series. Pip has faced very real dangers and she hasn't come out unscathed.Particularly after solving her last case, she's left with PTSD surrounding those events. Her emotional state of mind is fairly dark. She's struggling for real.Adding to her stress, because like all she's been through isn't enough, someone is harassing her.While Pip is used to trolls, any person with a public presence on the net is, she begins to take special notice when one particular troll asks her the same question over and over:who will look for you when you're the one who disappears?The harassment quickly escalates and Pip begins noticing things popping up around her house that indicate this person may be close by, watching her. Before long, there's no question, she has a stalker.As Pip starts to look into who this person might be, she discovers connections that may link her stalker to a local serial killer case purportedly solved six years ago. Is the wrong man in jail? Is the killer still on the loose? Will Pip be his next victim?When the police refuse to act on her behalf, Pip does the thing she is best at, she investigates herself. Is she finally in over her head?It's no secret that I absolutely love this series. Pip is one of my favorite characters in the literary world, but this novel finds her in a totally different headspace.Gone is our sparkling baby girl with all the optimism of a newborn pup. The world has beaten it out of her. She's seen the dark side of humanity in a way many people never do.I actually really appreciated that aspect of Pip's mental health being showcased. So many times in books, the protagonists go through incredibly horrific things and just seem to get over it. They bounce back in a way us regular peeps could never even dream of.The fact that Pip really struggles with recovering from her experiences made her feel that much more real to me. You can really empathize with her character.The tone of this entire story is much darker than the previous two and I feel like some people may not like it as much because of that. For me, it felt like the natural progression of Pip's story.As always, Pip is completely focused on the task at hand, even to the detriment of some of her relationships. I was concerned for a while about her relationship with Ravi; he's just such a gem.This one didn't turn out quite like I was expecting it to. There's one point where you think the story could be over, but then a huge twists sends it spinning off in a whole new direction.After this, I wouldn't say I was crazy about a lot of Pip's choices, but who am I to judge?As mentioned above, I would be super stoked if this weren't really the end. If it is though, I respect Jackson's decision and think she did an incredible job with this series.I would definitely reread all of these book again someday. I think it would be really fun to binge them back-to-back. If you haven't read this series yet, you better get cracking.

Although ""simple"" is not quite the right word, considering that said twist is murder.I absolutely LOVED this series! I loved everything about it, but I especially loved Pip - how smart she is, how determined, just everything about her. At first, my heart ached for her as she felt the need to take sleeping pills, even after her doctor took her off them. In the aftermath of the events in book 2, she suffered from PTSD and couldn\'t sleep anymore. She also kept seeing blood on her hands, so she didn\'t see a better way out.For more than half of the book, I could not put it down - it was that good.But then something happened. Besides the main storyline, Pip gets contacted by a woman who introduces her to another case that she then takes up on. It\'s about a guy confessing to crimes he didn\'t commit, because he was coerced into false confession by the police. It was the infamous case of a serial killer who murdered 5 women some years ago. As Pip takes matters into her own hands and investigates, she starts connecting that case with her own - the stalker who\'s been leaving dead pigeons in front of her house and who paints headless chalk stick figures in the driveway.Long story short, Pip finds out the identity of the actual murderer, when he manages to abduct her and plans to make her his sixth victim. She thinks she\'s as good as dead, but as fate would have it, she manages to escape.Here\'s where my issues begin: she flees through the woods, she\'s FREE. But then she turns around when she hears the killer return and decides to go back TO KILL HIM. Not just ""normal killing"", she hits him in the head. From behind. NINE TIMES. With a hammer!! üòê That is overkill. Not self-defense or anything. Overkill. I get that she thought no one would believe her over some respectable white guy, that he might not even have been arrested. Her word against his. I get that she was mad at this whole situation, BUT all I could think wasThere are a million ways she could have gone on about this. She\'s Pip freaking Fitz-Amobi. She could have figured something out, for sure. And not only did she murder someone, she thinks it\'s a good idea to blame it on someone else. üòêüòê Yes, Max is rapist scum and deserved to go to prison. But for HIS crimes, not murder he didn\'t commit. For her to kill someone cold-blooded and then blame it on someone else? That is so wrong on so many levels üòêam I the only one feeling this way?Not only does she make it look like someone else is the killer, staging false evidence and coming up with an elaborate scheme, but she gets Ravi to help her and also a few of her friends üòï that is so fucked up... And the way they handled a dead body, even made jokes during that time... But most of all, thinking it\'s ok to send someone else to jail for HER crime... just baffled me.If Pippa had PTSD from seeing up close how someone got fatally shot, how would she handle having hit a guy WITH A HAMMER!! TO THE HEAD!!? 9 TIMES!? For me, it wasn\'t enough that she distanced herself from her family, friends and boyfriend, only to later return when the trial was done and Max was convicted (supposing that\'s what happened in the end). It can\'t be that easy to get away with murder, even if you\'re a good person and the one who got killed deserved it.I guess I just wished she would have found a smart way to out the Duct Tape Killer in her podcast. Would that have been a little of a clich√©? Yes. But it would have made more sense, in my opinion. And she wouldn\'t have been a freaking killer herself. You see, she didn\'t kill the guy in self-defense, she wasn\'t in a situation where that would have been the only option. She turned around and decided it\'s best to just go kill him. It was premeditated. That makes her a murderer too, and I can\'t be ok with that. It\'s just all so messed up üôÅOK, rant over. üòÇ I probably repeated myself a bunch of times, but as stated before this is a rant üòÇ sorry üôà To sum up, this was partly a huge disappointment and a terrible way to close off such a great series IMO.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'this was TRAUMATIZING. it‚Äôs been a year and i still think about the ending.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'i‚Äôm actually sobbing'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '#1A Good Girl‚Äôs Guide to Murder‚Äî 3.75 Stars#2Good Girl, Bad Blood‚Äî 4.5 StarsIt‚Äôs all fun and games until YOU‚ÄôRE the one being stalked and chased by a serial killer . . . cause then you‚Äôre AS GOOD AS DEAD. üíÄLast time, Pip had been the kind of someone who outdid the police in cracking murder and missing person cases.

So, beware!This book started off well (if a little surprising for me to discover as it no longer followed the same format as the previous two books).Then about halfway point, it pulled the rug under my feet by handing me thetwist(Pip deliberately commits a murder)of a lifetime. . .*It wasn‚Äôt mind blowing in and of itself, but my mind did get blown by the audacity of it all.To put it simply,the aforementioned, unexpected turn of events KILLED the book for me as it became less about solving a MYSTERY andmoreaboutHOW TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER. As much as I‚Äôm appreciative of the knowledge being imparted (cause I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll put it to good use in the future*cue me being sarcastic*), I DID NOT WANT THIS FOR PIP. üò≠On the other hand, I can see why it would be the perfect route to take in bringing this trilogy to an end. Taking into account what had happened (Pip losing faith in the justice system, Pip witnessing a murder, Pip feeling guilty about not being able to save someone from book 2, Pip suffering from PTSD), it was only fair that this book would focus on her as all of those surely took a toll on her mentally and then some. It‚Äôs just that, along with it, I‚Äôm also questioning the believability, e.g.:‚ûù How is it that among all the DT Killer‚Äôs victims, only Pip (AN 18 YEAR OLD) managed to get away? Was it luck? Was it some statistics thing, like‚Äòone out of six serial killer‚Äôs victims is more likely to survive than others‚Äô? Was it merely survival instinct and self-perseverance?‚ûù How is it that after committing rape and a number of murders the DT Killer was easily deveated by AN 18 YEAR OLD? Was it his skills getting rusty? Was it purely him underestimating his victim? Was it all because it wasdestinyand he had it coming? Huh. I suppose it‚Äôs all of the above.‚ûù It also didn‚Äôt sit well with me the fact that Pip *roped* her friends into helping herget away with it, and they turned that narrative into them ‚Äútaking justice into their own hands.‚Äù Or the fact that the police was continuously portrayed as nothing but a useless ü§° throughout the series. I was mad everytime they turned Pip down when she needed their service.Okay, so maybe it wasn‚Äôtentirelyimplausible (or maybe I‚Äôm just too na√Øve and clueless of how the world works and think too highly of humanity). Regardless, I loved how all the mystery or cases from book 1 and 2 were brought together and tied into this one. This book was bringing everything full circle. Not to mention,the moral gray-ness in this finale was the blurriest amongst all the books. I appreciated the dark turn this installment took. On another note, it sucked that we didn‚Äôt get to see Pip with her friends as much, but her relationship with Ravi and their banter was cute and adorable (if also got a tad emotional towards the end).I‚Äôm wrapping up by telling you about the audiobook. I absolutely loved the audiobooks for AGGGTM and GGBB, but I was a bit let down by this one. Firstly, this book was written just like any other novel‚Äîno more newspaper clippings, charts, text screenshots, and interview recordings. Secondly, Idk if the publishers made two audio versions (UK & US) for each book, butthe first two audiobooks I listened to were full casts and narrated in the American accent. Meanwhile,this was singly narrated in the English accent. I have to say that I preferred the American ones. The performance was truly unmatched.To sum up, this conclusion was interesting and intense but leaning more towards disappointing. I didn‚Äôt agree with the direction it took, and I didn‚Äôt feel assured by the ending. However, I can understand why it had to go this way, and I didn‚Äôt outrightly hate the book. As a matter of fact, I have a lot of admiration towards the series. It‚Äôs definitely become my favorite in the YA category. If you‚Äôre gearing up to read this book, don‚Äôt expect it to be like the first two. Prepare for all the moral dilemma it‚Äôll cause and get ready to be mindblown‚Äîwhether in a good or bad way, that‚Äôs for you to find out.(Read as an Audiobook)'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Imagine the kind of research Holly Jackson had to do in order to write this book ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏èThis was a wild conclusion to a wild series! I'll try to give some non-spoilery opinions here and hopefully keep it short.Let's begin by saying that I didn't love this book as much as I loved the first two. I haven't read Kill Joy (but I'm planning to), so you can expect that sometime in the near future. This book was the longest in the series and had the slowest start. It took me about 100-150 pages to get into the plot and for a thriller, that's not really good. When reading this genre, the sole purpose of the book is to hook you from page 1. This wasn't the case here and I continued reading only because it featured characters I grew to love and care for. So, if it weren't for Pip and Ravi (thank you Pip and Ravi!), this would've been a DNF.After those first 150 pages, this got GOOD. And when I say good, I actually mean GREAT. It was chilling, it was scary, it kept me on the edge of my seat (atp I'm glued down to this damn couch). Pip got in some serious trouble this time and the stakes were much much higher than in the previous two installments. That's all I'm really gonna say about this book bc going into it blind is what I would recommend.Romance is only a tiny tiny subplot in this series but PipRavi really said VENI VIDI VINCI. They served like never before! Truly one of my favorite book couples of all time! And I feel like because EVERYTHING WENT WRONG in this book, it was their time to shine. Their emotional connection and love really came through and I was living for it!This is another issue I had with this book, so I'll say it and wait for you to crucify me: I'M SICK AND TIRED OF THE ANTAGONISTS AND THEIR CRIMES (and y'all know who they are). I needed fresh new people (and yes I know Pip is from a small town but are you trying to convince me their population is 10 people???). I get that the idea was the shock factor you can't really give us unless it's people-we-know-turning-bad, but c'mon!I was told there would be all these attractive singlesSo yeah, in other words, the bad guys got a bit repetitive. Just how many crimes can 10 people commit?Patiently waiting for Holly Jackson to drop new books so I can theorize about murderers and be tragically wrong again!ü§™ü§™""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'I. AM. ANGRY. words cannot describe the anger this put me through but i‚Äôm writing this for Ravi who deserved betterüòå‚ö†Ô∏èMASSIVE SPOILERS‚ö†Ô∏èFirstly, the book starts off with Pip acting very out of character, from her buying drugs from the guy who supplied them to Max who used them to rape Becca and then becoming addicted to them because of her PTSD. To her ignoring her loved ones (even poor Ravi) when they are concerned for her moral character.In the book the killer sends Pip cryptic messages asking her ‚Äúwhose gonna look for you when you disappear‚Äù and this girl literally counts everyone in her life (Ravi, Connor, Jamie, Nat, Becca , her mom and dad) and is like ‚Äúi mean i guess they would look for me üëâüëà but would Ravi???‚Äù like huh?? what does he have to do to prove to you that he loves you?? he already has been through so much for Pip from rehashing the trauma from his brothers murder to helping her through the case of Child Brunswick in the previous book. I mean he literally says they are Team Pip and Ravi and she still questions his love for her. Like if that isn‚Äôt toxic idek what is.But here is where things get crazy okay. This girl gets kidnapped by the killer and ESCAPES only to come back to MURDER THIS MAN because of her PTSD?? i‚Äôm still confused why, and then she proceeds to call Ravi to help her FRAME THE MURDER on Max. ‚ùì‚ÅâÔ∏èI would like to remind the audience that Ravi‚Äôs brother, Sal, was ‚ú®MURDERED AND FRAMED‚ú® that‚Äôs right ladies and gentlemen, and Pippus Maximus over here wants Ravi to help her FRAME a man *she* MURDERED. I don‚Äôt know if the author intended these parallels to happen but it was incredibly infuriating to read when the situation hit a little too close to home for Ravi. I mean you would think that he would have learned something from his brothers mistakes, he admitted in the previous books that he felt his brother was too naive and maybe too nice which is why he met such a terrible fate. So then why have Ravi be so willing to help Pip especially if he is supposed to be her moral compass?? make it make sense.So, Ravi only wanting to be there for Pip because the author made him believe that she was the only thing he has left, agrees to help her hide and frame what she did üòÉ. The fact that the author knew that if they just made Pip do it on her own it would make her seem like a monster so they had to throw innocent, lovable, Ravi in the mix to justify her actions. I mean he literally tries to justify Pips actions FOR her. ü§ßSkipping past all of the unforgivable things that Pip did that infuriated me now so I can talk about the absolute monstrosity the ending was.AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHGHGHHGHHHHHGHHHHGPIP LITERALLY BREAKS UP WITH RAVI. ‚ÅâÔ∏èshe claims she is trying to save him from herself but she is just being a total and utterly horrible narcissist. And don‚Äôt worry i‚Äôll explain exactly why. Ravi who had just helped her FRAME SOMEONE ELSE FOR MURDER is obviously going through it. It would be safe to assume that he would be feeling immense guilt, trauma, and remorse, especially because of his experience with his own brother getting murdered and framed. But he put all of that aside FOR PIP. You would think that after being an accomplice with someone in order to protect them you would both help each other through the experience. but NOPE. Pip got what she needed from Ravi and is now done. Pip thinks she is doing such a great job at protecting Ravi by leaving him after making him feel like she was the only person he had and abandons him to deal with it on his own.And for those who think I‚Äôm exaggerating here is an exact quote from the book on pg 444 ‚ÄúRavi broke behind her, crying out into the trees, the wind carrying his sobs over her, trying to pull her back. She kept going.‚Äù yessir, she made this boy help her frame someone for murder only a few days ago and keep it a secret only to break up with him and walk away.But here‚Äôs the real kicker folks, SHE DOESN‚ÄôT EVEN FULLY BREAK UP WITH HIM. SHE MAKES HIM BELIEVE SHE MIGHT COME BACK. She‚Äôs like, ‚Äúi can be with you if max is convicted of being guilty to the murder. So i might come back, might not ü•∞‚Äù ????? Why is she leaving him hanging?? If Pip really cared about Ravi she would break up with him and ask him to move on because she is dangerous. If she had his best interests in heart she would know that he deserved someone else and it would also add some character development because she would be SELF AWARE. It would make sense. Not her telling him they can be together if her plan which involved Ravi is successful. If she truly wanted to protect Ravi she would have LET. HIM. GO. for good.This is only a fraction of the anger this book caused me and I literally cannot describe my thoughts accurately.

TITLE REVEAL!'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '‚ùùYou\'ve lost your mind‚ùû‚ùùMaybe. So you should be terrified‚ùûHonestly, I want to give this book one star so bad. I‚Äôm free and disappointed, but not exactly surprised. The only reason this isn‚Äôt getting a one-star review is RaviPip ship. Their relationship is literally the only thing that saved this for me. I was this close ü§è to calling it quits because, let\'s be real‚Äîthis series didn‚Äôt even give me a single spine-chilling moment.I‚Äôm not even joking when I say thatKill Joywas scarier than the main three books. Yeah, you read that right. The plot twist? I saw it coming from the first 30%. The second Jason Bell showed up, he was on my list of suspects. So, when it turned out he was the killer? I was like, ‚ÄúOkay, cool‚Ä¶ next.‚ÄùHere‚Äôs the thing.. an entire ‚Äúthriller series‚Äù didn‚Äôt even shock me once. Like, I was seriously bored. I didn‚Äôt get a single gasp or any jaw-dropping moments. I‚Äôm sorry, but after reading this, I‚Äôm just done. You know what? The only part that gave me chills was that one scene where they found Pip‚Äôs headphones. *That* was it. That‚Äôs the only part that hit right. Otherwise, the rest felt like a missed opportunity.Let‚Äôs talk about the plot for a sec. Like I said, I saw the twist coming from a mile away. Jason Bell? Totally figured it out. The whole thing with the ‚Äúmurderer gene‚Äù and the psychopath bloodlines was obvious from the get-go.I‚Äôve learned fromdefending Jacobwhich is called [The murder gene] it‚Äôs basically if there‚Äôs a psychopath/ murderer this killer gene will go in his bloodline. So at the start of the book when I started suspecting dawn/ Jason bell. I remembered the murderer gene (Their daughter is a murderer) and I mean, when I read about the ropes, duct tape, and the hairbrush? Come on. Those were the clues staring me in the face. Halfway through, I knew what was up‚ÄîAndie‚Äôs unsent email just confirmed all my suspicions.Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm mad: I thought, ""Okay, the wife‚ÄîDawn‚Äîmust be the killer!"" I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I was really hoping she was. If you ask me, it would‚Äôve been such a killer plot twist‚Äîsuch a slap to Pip‚Äôs face. But no. It was Jason. I get why he could‚Äôve been the one, but seriously, Dawn being the mastermind would‚Äôve been such a wild turn. And you know what? There was this moment when one of the victims lost their necklace, and I just knew Dawn had something to do with it. The necklace, the watch, the earrings? All stuff I thought would connect back to her. But nope, she wasn‚Äôt the killer, and I was pissed.After reading that one of the victims lost her neckless I immediately recognized Dawn‚Äôs neckless at the scene where she was walking past pip when she held it around her fingers (bc I know authors mention things that always matter in pacing by ways) and my suspicion was proven right it was for one of the victims And the fact that all the missing items from the victims were hair brush/ neckless/ watch/ earrings‚Ä¶ I know even men wear these things but I‚Äôm just saying between looking at him and his wife I‚Äôll say the wife might me interested in such things. And I was right he was stealing these things and giving them to his wife and daughters.Now, let me talk about the writing. It was just bland. The characters didn‚Äôt have any depth to them. Like, there was no exploration of their fears, their past, or their motivations. We were just told, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs Pip. Here‚Äôs Ravi. They‚Äôre doing things.‚Äù But I didn‚Äôt feel any of it. Pip was putting herself in life-threatening situations just for the thrill? And Ravi was doing everything just to be there for her? That‚Äôs not enough to make me care. And then we have the serial killer‚Ä¶ who we know nothing about. Like, why was he like that? What made him this way? Could‚Äôve been a real moment to dive deep, but instead, we got... nothing.As for the spooky factor? It was nonexistent. I wanted that creepy atmosphere, the kind of eerie tension that makes you look over your shoulder while you read. I was hoping for more of those ‚ÄúOh, hell no‚Äù moments, but instead, the whole thing just felt flat. There was no atmosphere, no buildup, no nothing. So yeah, the suspense didn‚Äôt land. It felt like every twist was telegraphed before it happened.And let‚Äôs talk about the predictability. It was way* too easy to guess what was coming. I mean, there was no real mystery here. Throw in a couple more suspects, some unexpected motivations, and maybe we could‚Äôve had something worth reading. But no. I knew exactly where it was headed.And I‚Äôm sorry, but I have to call out the writing here. Holly Jackson could‚Äôve really stepped up the prose‚Äîbetter sentence structure, tighter vocab, something to make it shine. It wasn‚Äôt horrible, but it definitely wasn‚Äôt anything special.But, like, I‚Äôm not trying to rain on the whole book. It had its moments. The relationship between Pip and Ravi? Iconic. Seriously, their dynamic is the only thing that kept me from throwing this book across the room. Their bond was real‚Äîand honestly, it was the one thing that made me care. I loved how they balanced each other out, how they saved each other when things were spiraling. Ravi‚Äôs loyalty? 10/10 Their bond is definitely one for the books (pun intended).And yeah, Pip had her moments where she made me want to throw hands‚Äîespecially with the whole ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna hide a body and hope Ravi doesn‚Äôt notice‚Äù move. Sis, are you serious? If she‚Äôd just been open with Ravi from the start, we wouldn‚Äôt have had any of this mess. But despite that, the way they took on this huge, risky thing together made their relationship stronger in the end. And I gotta admit, that was the one part that almost made me forget about everything else.Almost. Because I didn‚Äôt.So yeah The biggest reason this book didn‚Äôt get a one-star from me was that I lowkey live for the way Pip and Ravi were there for each other.Pip Fitz-Amobi? Honestly, what a hot mess. She‚Äôs meant to be this complex character, but at the end of the day, she was just frustrating. She‚Äôs popping pills after committing murder, and then all of a sudden, she‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúOh wait, I‚Äôm done with them now."" Like, girl, what? That whole ‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking control of my life‚Äù arc? Yeah, never happened. She never really learned from her mistakes, either. She‚Äôs just... stuck in her own mess.Now, let‚Äôs get into the real part of this book. The murder itself? That was actually kind of satisfying. Killing a serial killer and putting the blame on a rapist? Damn, I‚Äôll take it. The buildup to it was solid. The rage behind it, the way Pip finally snapped‚Äîit felt real. And that tiny flaw in her plan? It made the whole thing feel so much more authentic. I loved that little glitch in the perfect plan. And you know what? It made the relationship between Pip and Ravi even stronger.So yeah, I gave it 2 stars, not 1. Because honestly, their relationship was everything.The Relationship üíï‚ùùIt\'s me and you, trouble. Team Ravi and Pip‚ùûI never thought their relationship would get this deep, but here we are. I mean, if my man‚Äôs not willing to hide a body with me, what‚Äôs the point? (Just kidding, don‚Äôt actually try that.) But I love how they‚Äôre each other‚Äôs safe space. Every time Pip is spiraling, she thinks of Ravi. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs the one thing that keeps her grounded, and I was here for that. I don‚Äôt even care if it‚Äôs cheesy; it works.‚ÄúNo thoughts beyond the first insane thing that came into her head. No deeper, no darker. Ravi was the fence in her head that kept it all back.‚ÄùI swear, whenever things got dark for Pip, imagining Ravi was what kept her from completely losing it.the fact that 1 year, 8 months and 16 days later, 3 minutes after the verdict was read in The Crown vs. Max Hastings, Ravi texted Her!‚ÄùHey Sarge, remember me?‚ÄùOh, and one last thing? If you hate Andie Bell, please stay away from me. I‚Äôm her #1 defender.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4.5 starsokay wow. this book took acompletelydifferent turn from the others. not necessarily in a good way. however, i still thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. i was in a slump as i finished up this book but that did not stop me from liking it. the reason it took me so long to finish was partly bc of the fact that i took breaks from 12-14 and 16-17. still not completely sure about my rating but we‚Äôre settling with it for now.the beginning of this book has a very interesting start. it‚Äôs a bit morbid, but nonetheless gets straight to the point. it‚Äôs clear that pip‚Äôs hate for max makes her lash out. and she also ‚Äúruined‚Äù every single happy moment she had with her friends by thinking about the ending of the second book. i think that this book alluded to quite a few things in the beginning since i went into this book knowing all the spoilers and everything.‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Pippa Fricking Fitz-Amobi. My little Sarge. Pippus Maximus, and there‚Äôs nothing you can‚Äôt do.‚ÄùShe cried and she let herself cry, a few minutes to grieve for the girl she could never be again.pip, my sweet girl. she is the epitome of would‚Äôve, could‚Äôve, should‚Äôve by taylor swift in this book. i gotta say i loved her in the first 2 books. despite her lacking personality, she was still such an enjoyable character, and something that rlly stuck with me throughout this series was the fact that they never lost their true self. with this book, it takes a completely different turn, given she has completely lost herself, and has become this paranoid person who cannot sleep and has so much pressure on her. i can‚Äôt say i can necessarily embrace the change. however she is not to blame given the trauma she suffered from the last two. not to mention she felt all alone and as though she wasn‚Äôt normal because every case that she was involved in everyone believes that the ppl who commuted it are monsters. however, she felt like she understood them and why they did it, and she had no one to talk to about it bc it‚Äôs morally known as ‚Äúwrong‚Äù and no one would get it.He hated confrontation, hated it, and even so, Pip knew he would go to war for her if she ever asked.It‚Äôs me and you, trouble. Team Ravi and Pip.ravi. the light in pip‚Äôs world. oh how i loved them together. the way he was able to stick by her side throughout everything was just so sweet. their relationship was at its peak in this book. he believed her through everything and never once doubted her, even when everyone thought she was crazy for thinking she had a stalker. he was able to reassure her and help her through everything and it was just amazing. despite the ending that they had, the love they had for each other was present in everything they did. that ending had me bawling my eyes out. their interactions had every emotion associated with it, from laughter to sadness and anger.the writing was very repetitive throughout the story as a way to convey pip‚Äôs ptsd which i appreciated. i always enjoyed holly jackson‚Äôs writing style bc of how simple it was and how easy it is to follow. it was also able to perfectly portray the love pip and ravi had for each other and it was just.. beautiful. i loved it. it also really hones in on the emotions and feelings of pip and how she felt. she felt as though she wasn‚Äôt normal because of how ‚Äúblurred‚Äù the lines were in her last investigations.‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt going to leave you alone in there with him,‚Äù Nat said firmly. ‚ÄúNot until I knew you were safe.‚Äùafter everything that nat and pip have been through, i am so glad that she was able to bond with pip nonetheless and put aside their differences in the first few books. i rlly enjoyed reading abt their friendship and how nat tried her best to look out for her and made sure she was safe. it was also so sweet to see her and jamie get together after everything in the second book. nat deserves all the happiness <3 she‚Äôs such a strong character and i just loved her, especially in this one.spoilers from this point on!!i hated the uncertainty of everything in this book. for one, she had to get her friends involved and they were super uneasy while doing their part. they never even got confirmation of what happened and the ending was also open ended. not to mention the only role that her friends played was to help cover up a murder they were unsure about this entire time. i think it kind of frustrated me for them to never get confirmation and inevitably entangle themselves in a murder despite the fact that it was necessary for everything to happen.‚ÄúHow would we get away with this?‚Äù he said, the question almost ridiculous enough for a smile.How to get away with murder.Pip felt it again; that creeping feeling up her spine, cold and inevitable. Like everything was playing out the way it was always supposed to, from the start. Coming full circle. And she was simply a passenger inside her own body, watching the show play out.in the beginning, pip was attempting to save herself after everything that she has gone through and her life was becoming consumed in trying to save herself. given that her last few cases had a good motive for all the terrible things that each character did, it made pip very conflicted and i understood her. on the second part, everything took a turn and i love how well thought out it was and everything on pip‚Äôs part. she tried her best not to involve anyone and it‚Äôs clear how much she loves her friends in her life. the difference with the crime that pip committed was the fact that the ppl she got involved (max) deserved everything coming to them (jason). it showed that the justice system rlly was flawed and sometimes you need to take things into your own hands.‚ÄúThis is why it all happened. Everything. Full circle,‚Äù she added quietly. The beginning was the end and the end the beginning,and DT was both.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not how it‚Äôs supposed to be. You‚Äôre supposed to listen to me. That‚Äôs all. Listen and do what you‚Äôre told. How is that so hard?‚ÄùJason Bell was dead, but he wasn‚Äôt dead yet; he would be in a few hours. And Max Hastings would be the one who killed him. Finally locked away where he belonged.i hated jason bell with a passion, especially after reading this book. in the beginning, i found it to be childish how he started a fight with max given that he was a grown ass adult and max was still growing. after i found out that he drowned barney, my hatred for him doubled. he also had this mindset that everyone needed to listen to him and when they didn‚Äôt, he felt the need to kill them which i just hated. he‚Äôs everything that is wrong in this world, thinking women need to listen to men and believing we should not speak up, which absolutely infuriates me.This feels too big for me, but I think I can do it. Save us. Keep Becca safe. Survive.Pip wasn‚Äôt there to save Andie, but maybe Andie was there to save her.i didn‚Äôt expect andie bell to have a factor in this book but knowing she had to live with a dark secret and keep it from everyone she knew was just so sad. it was obvious that she loved sal and becca dearly and she seemed so sweet in the unsent email she wrote. all she wanted was to try and get away from her murderous father and save her sister along the way. and the way she was ‚Äúsaving‚Äù pip was something that i found to be wholesome. the love she had for sal was also so similar to pip and ravi‚Äôs love. i think that her character arc really shows that you never know when someone is suffering.‚ÄúIt sucks when someone puts something in your drink and then ruins your life, huh?‚ÄùAnd Pip knew, as her eyes trailed away from him, that this wasn‚Äôt just about her own survival; she knew herself well enough by now. Had reckoned with that dark place in her mind long enough.This was also revenge.This town wasn‚Äôt big enough for the both of them. This world wasn‚Äôt. One of them had to go, and Pip was going to give one hell of a fight.i feel like max got what was coming for him after everything that he has done. i understand why pip saw red every single time she spotted him. he deserved everything that happened to him and i am so glad that he was placed in jail, even if drastic measures had to be taken to get him there. when pip had the vision of throwing max in front of a bus and punching him, i was honest to god worried until i realized it was a vision. this book really shows that when the justice system won‚Äôt take things seriously, you have to take them in your own hands.‚ÄúI‚Äôm a ticking time bomb, Ravi. I can‚Äôt have the people I love near me when it goes off.Especially not you.‚ÄùHe couldn‚Äôt be her person and she couldn‚Äôt be his right now. Pip had to be the strong one, the one to walk away when neither of them wanted it.The one who chose.‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my Pip and I‚Äôm your Ravi. We‚Äôre a team.‚Äù ü•πafter everything that pip and ravi have been together, i have no doubt that they got back together. knowing that they were willing to choose each other makes me have hope that they would continue to at any given time, even694 daysafter having no contact. the way ravi begged her to stay and not leave him made my heart ache for them. i feel so sad knowing that their happy ending isn‚Äôt confirmed. like wdym i don‚Äôt see them have a happy epilogue where they‚Äôre married and together?! i‚Äôm utterly obsessed with them üò©ÀèÀã¬∞‚Ä¢*‚ÅÄ‚û∑kill joy - 2.5 starsa good girl‚Äôs guide to murder - 4.25 starsgood girl, bad blood - 4.75 starsas good as dead - 4.5 starspre-reviewyou don‚Äôt know true pain and emotional damage until you‚Äôve read this book. trust me on this. rtcmaybe<3reading reviewOK BRING ON THE SCARY IM READY NOW!!(i‚Äôm terrified)pre-read reviewhow much of the plot for this book have i spoiled for myself? i myself have no idea'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Àö‚Çä‚ÄßÍí∞·Éê 5 stars ‚òÜ ‡ªíÍí± ‚Äß‚ÇäÀö‡ºâ‚Äß‚ÇäÀö. ¬´Save herself to save herself.¬ª „Éª‚Çä‚úßÀóÀèÀã ‚ÄºÔ∏èSPOILER WARNING‚ÄºÔ∏è ÀéÀäÀósoo i know how late this review is üòç it took me a while to process everything that has happened throughout the book. people told me this would be dark. however, i don‚Äôt think anything would prepare me forthis. with this book, i went through five stages of grief.i had so many theories about what was gonna happen and i was stressed out üòÉhow didPipandRaviplan this WHOLE thing in a few minutes? she‚Äôs such a genius and i don‚Äôt know how she does it honestly. she‚Äôs my idol.

THEIR FIRST KISS WAS THE LEAST ROMANTIC KISS EVER!! you are telling me i waited a whole book for THAT. it felt like the author just wanted to get it over and done with. cut the cameras and do it over again and make it more passionate.‚Äî nothing ‚Äúmajor‚Äù happens until the last couple of chapters. but it was all still anticlimactic to me bc i saw it from a mile away with how it was teased. i‚Äôm sorry but with how some people were going on about how the ending was purely shocking, i literally thought someone died only to get to this basic cliffhanger üò≠ there were no heart racing moments, no excitement or anticipation, nada. also wtf was that plot twist towards the end?? was that added for shock value too??‚Äî will i be reading the next book? of course, i feel like the next book should have an actual plot unlike this book and everything is set up well for fearless. and imagine all the angsttt. i‚Äôm really hoping lauren goes in the right direction with that book!! ü§û even though this book was a mess it was still a quick read.„Äåthe powerless trilogy„Äç#1Powerless‚Äî4 stars#1.5 Powerful ‚Äî TBR#2 Reckless ‚Äî1.5 stars'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '2.00!‚ÄúHate me enough to make me want you.‚Äù I cup her jaw, feeling her eyes burning into mine. ‚ÄúRuin me""What a waste of potential tbh. I would say that despite enjoying the first bookI had minimal expectationsso I cant really blame this book being bad on my expectations because they were not high at all lol. The writing in this book was so mid like üò≠ the author just went on writing the same thing over and over again until we reached the last bits which was supposed to be mind blowing but came off as too predictable. I did enjoy the first 80 to 100 pages to be honest but then the constant push and pull and the way the author filled this book withtoo many quotesthat they didn\'t even hit like they should and üò≠üò≠I cant even start at how tropey it waslike surely you cannot write all the tropes in this book and expect all of them to hit the readers the same way. It just got so claustrophobic in there that I wanted to finish it.Paedynour FMC üòÆ\u200düí® I really liked her in the first book but I was so frustrated when it came to her character in this one, dont get me wrong I still enjoyed reading her point of view but I feared that my eyes would be stuck at the back of my head if I read Paedyn saying""I would not hesitate to kill him next time""and not doing that the next time one more timeüò≠ because saying it once or twice makes sense but more than that and you look like a fool which unfortunately Paedyn did look like for majority of the book. It\'s that I thought with how things ended in book 1 Paedyn would put up a little bit of fight and she did for like 80 pages but then it vanished?? and I hated that so much.Kai, I enjoyed his point of view as well and I did have fun reading about him and I liked that we got an insight of his past, I also liked his flirty nature and the way he would speak of her and his dialogues in general but when you\'re sent out to kill her and you\'re trying to be string enough to do thatYOU DONT START FLIRTING WITH THEMbut I had almost very little complaints with Kai because even poor writing can\'t do Kai wrong. As forKitt, I found his pov similar to how I felt Apollo\'s pov was in ACFTL.....boring and unnecessary.The plot was where?? for a romantasy there was barely any fantasy in it.Dont get me wrong, if it was a full romance book it would\'ve been an easy 3.5-4 starsbut as a romantasy it failed to deliver on anything but the romance and even a part of that was annoying. The author said that this book was abuild upto the third book but there was honestly nothing building up until like the last 30-50 pages and I am not even lying when I say this thiscould have been a 100-150 paged novella if we keep in mind the important things that happen and if you want to add more romance to that but dont want to overfill it 200 pages at bestand it would have been perfect, would have had us at the edge of our seats and would have given us some actual content in one go rather than it being dispersed among filler scenes and it would\'ve been more easy to write and would have given Lauren more time to focus on book 3 so she could have delivered a massive finale. A little bit of this book was about Kai going after Paedyn (100 pages at best) and then it was them trying to go back to Ilya. The ending I saw coming because I honestly saw no other suitable way to end this book and basing it off peoples reactions my suspicions were confirmed so even for what most peopled saved this book, failed for me.The romance, I did enjoy the dialogues exchanged, the tensions and angst at times (until it got too much) and some of the cute moments that they shared but one thing that this book lacked was slow burn because everything happened so fast and wasnt this supposed to be enemies to lovers?? what I read was definitely not enemies to love it wastwo people being in deniallike the constant push and pull was fun at the beginning but it got so tedious because it was the same thing repeated until the end and I wanted scream at them. I wanted more slow burn like yes the first book was slow burn enough but when you end powerless saying that Kai would be going out to kill Pae you would expect more fresher slow burn and thats why I did not really love the first kiss, it was written well but I just didnt like how fast it happened. It could have happened later on as well. I do admit that there was angst and tension but it didn\'t hit me. I liked the development the character got through romance but theres this thing called balancing a book and there was no balance here and tbh if I wanted that I would have just picked up a romance novel instead of this.I did enjoy some parts of it and I liked Kai + the fast paced nature of this book and I can see people who only want KaiPae romantic moments would really enjoy this book but honestly I wanted that but only to an extent with balance, political intrigue and a plot because otherwise I would\'ve just read When Gracie Met the Grump which is sitting right beside me.Overall, A disappointing experience and im hoping that the conclusion redeems itself with more Mak scenes.~~~Look what just came in the mail üôà‚Ä¢Buddy reading with the one and onlyRoxy'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""‚û∫ 3 stars‚ÄúHate me enough to make me want you.‚ÄùThis has to be the longest I've waited for a book and NOT enjoyed it. This one was supposed to be angsty with bittersweet moments, a proper development that does justice to the story, but there wasn't any! Kai was basicallyuseless, Kitt wassleepless, and pae ofc ispowerless.‚û≥ This book didn't fail to deliver the cutest scenes ever, the dancing, the team-up, the rain scene, and much more, butIT FAILED TO DELIVER THE PLOT.I'm sorry, but the whole book revolved around or had to revolve around Kai finding Paedyn, which he did after a week? And all the struggle he did here, was just to keep her with himself because she keeps running away.ALSO A BIG EXCUSEEEEEMEEEEE TO THE ENDING *rolling my eyes rn*‚û≥ I was bored of the dramatics, the sentences were overused.

It's not a fantasy book; it was normal ordinary people surviving because no power elements were mentioned here.There is no plot development in all those 300 pages.If Lauren wrote this book for Kai and Paedyn's relationship development, then she succeeded, but this brought no progress to the story at all.Paedyn being injured for the majority of the book BUT if you touch her, she'll beat yo ass and hand it to you back... then she'll realize AGAIN that she's injured.The ending was predictable, wayyyy too predictable that even my theories were better than it! I focused too much on details and made BETTER theories but I doubt that there's any type of mystery. I didn't like how it unraveled, and Kitt's chapters were boring, he's good but his character will either be ruined or he becomes better ‚úãüèª‚û≥ I'm giving three stars becauseI truly do love Kai, and Paedyn is a likable character too.They're really fit for a sweet romance book because they're the best together. Just for the sake of the non-existent plot, the push and pull was annoying the fuck out of me at one point. If it weren't for the end, I would've said that PAEDYN DOES NOT FEEL THE WAY KAI FEELS ABOUT HER. There's no balance. But yay, I survived!!I had some theories: like paedyn's father died because he was somehow involved in Ava's sickness (as he was a healer and used to visit the palace), and the treason, the king talked about, was about this and not about the resistance. also, Paedyn might be a MIX and not an ordinary, and is somehow related to Ava's sickness üò≠ or her powers were not working because of her father's ring. ahwjshs nvm my mind was working a lot but nothing happened. we got a simple explanation‚ÄúLet me dance for the both of us.‚Äù‚ÄúLet me swim for the both of us.‚ÄùKAI AZER, WHERE ARE YOU!!

It doesn\'t really do that, that aspect is minimal. However, if you want some bonding, relationship development, and angst this is the one for you. I personally, loved that the author took time to build on Kai and Pae\'s relationship as the way the book ended felt A LOT more impactful.I loved Kai and Pae\'s POV. The way they felt about things and the action sequences were good.Kitt\'s POVhowever fell flat for me. I was expecting him to be a bit darker, but I got mildly dark at the most.

I felt that Roberts relied too heavily on the romantic relationship between Kai and Pae and didn't move the story along enough. That's not to say that 3 stars is a bad rating because it's not, I did love some aspects of the story.But it felt inadequate. Look, I'm all for the relationship between these two but I felt like it came across a little surface level and lacking depth considering how book 1 ended. There has to be a wider range between these two. Take us through it, gut us. Leave us in limbo for a while.The anger and resentment they felt towards each other felt like a joke. Not figuratively, literally- like hehe haha. Pae seemed emotionally flat when it came to Adena. A little less banter and 'ocean eye gazing' would have gone a long way here.So Mac just dropped off the face of the earth for this book?No sufficient mention of Adena? After the ending of Powerless and after Powerful?

I hated kitt though‚Ä¶ bro really thought he was the victim. I wanted to smack him upside the head. also, where was mak?? he better have a huge role in the next book lauren.‚Äß ‚Çä Àö‚ùÄ‚ï∞‚Ä∫ the romance ‡ºâ‚Äß ‚Çä Àöit was cute in and of itself, but I was expecting something different. there was plenty of paedyn and kai shamelessly flirting and simping over each other in the first book. After the ending, I expected them to actually be enemies, toactuallystart hating each other and distancing themselves from each other and give me some actual tension. But no. There were a few weak scenes where the two pretended to hate each other, and then they immediately fell back into the recycled banter that we were already given an overdose of in the first book.spoiler!even though kai literally had paedyn chained up and was taking her to her own imminent death,end of spoilerthey still flirted and cuddled and had serious, romantic moments with the weak excuse of ‚Äúoh, we‚Äôre just pretending‚Äù (trying to pull off an enemies-with-benefits but they were already too in love with each other for it to work and it was added like an afterthought because even Roberts realized how unbelievable it was).we had the classic ‚ÄúI‚Äôm starting to trust him against my better judgment‚Äù and ‚Äúsomehow, we‚Äôve become friends‚Äù, which would‚Äôve worked fine if this was simply a rivals-to-lovers. But paedyn and kai are on opposite sides of the law. They should not have been acting like a spicy old married couple. It doesn‚Äôt really count as tension if they‚Äôre literally not even making an effort to act like enemies. Listen, I love paekai but the circumstances surrounding their romance made the entire thing so unrealistic. It isn‚Äôt enemies-to-lovers atp. It‚Äôs lovers-who-are-also-enemies.‚Äß ‚Çä Àö‚ùÄ‚ï∞‚Ä∫ the writing ‡ºâ‚Äß ‚Çä Àöthere are some amazing quotes in this book, when taken out of context, but fit them in amid the rest of the writing and they seem extremely forced. Roberts is trying to pass off stuff I can tell took her a good bit to come up with as stuff that the characters just thought up on the spot, causing the dialogue to not even feel like dialogue anymore but poor poetry. She was suffocating her own writing underher own writing. I can genuinely tell that she has a solid voice but it‚Äôs buried underneath the adjectives and adverbs and double sentences with the same meanings that she feels like she has to add to embellish her writing. writing doesn‚Äôt have to be fancy and pretty. Sometimes it is, and sometimes it works. but it‚Äôs okay to have simple, invisible writing because if the rest of the book is developed enough, that‚Äôs all you need. You shouldn‚Äôt be trying to hide an underdeveloped book under pretty writing. I‚Äôm not going to forget about the glaring lack of plot just because your character just spewed some poetic nonsense.‚Äß ‚Çä Àö‚ùÄ‚ï∞‚Ä∫ (lack of) plot ‡ºâ‚Äß ‚Çä Àölauren should‚Äôve deleted the whole Resistance thing altogether and marketed this series as pure romantasy‚Äì because that‚Äôs what it is.recklessis 300-something pages of paekai with hardly any breaks. And to be honest, it worked. No matter how unrealistic their romance was, it was a nice escape from real life. they were cute and fun and I would definitely root for them. but there was something nagging in the back of my mind that I couldn‚Äôt ignore reminding me that it‚Äôsnotjust a romance. It‚Äôs supposed to be a high fantasy with a revolution plot, one that was nowhere in sight. I guess she‚Äôs going to cram that entire plotline intofearless... good luck lol.‚Äß ‚Çä Àö‚ùÄ‚ï∞‚Ä∫ overall, ‡ºâ‚Äß ‚Çä Àöwhile I had a good time with this book, it didn‚Äôt live up to the expectations that I had for it and I‚Äôm kind of disappointed.

(pages: 146, 256) it almost feels illegal to find them in a book! Lauren please get yourself a better editor.- no plot‚Ä¶it just felt like a really long buildup and things finally happened in the last 10 pages.- Kitt‚Äôs POV was boring. all his chapters were about was him being depressed in his office. and also he literally started going insane at the end‚Ä¶- it‚Äôs starting to seem like there may be a love triangle‚Ä¶and i know i‚Äôm gonna hate it.- the dialogue is almost too perfect to the point where it doesn‚Äôt even seem human and natural. it‚Äôs like these characters were handed a script and forced to say these things. the conversations were lacking flow.what i liked- loved the fight scenes! there weren‚Äôt a lot but the longer ones were written well.- the writing has already improved so much. i found a lot of lines that i liked.- gorgeous cover art!- decent character development.- some really good romantic lines. i would not be able to come up with some of these. i need to take notes‚Ä¶- the love confession was PERFECT. except it would‚Äôve been so much better if there were an actual buildup to it instead of a ton of flirting. but it had me smacking my book, screaming, crying, throwing up. that is how you write a love confession!- KAI. i want to say ‚Äúhe‚Äôs basic‚Äù, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs cringey‚Äù, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs creepy‚Äù‚Ä¶.but he‚Äôs hot. i might be in love with him.- Paedyn was vulnerable, sometimes funny, sometimes annoying. i‚Äôm starting to like her better than how she was in book 1. and as i said before, i saw some development!- it wasn‚Äôt as heavy in tropes as Powerless. it almost felt relieving. the ‚Äúone bed‚Äù trope was in here twice, and ‚Äútending to wounds‚Äù was reused about 3 times. it felt less overwhelming in my opinion.- THE PLOT TWIST/ENDING. i could have predicted it if i actually thought about the plot for a second, but i was so immersed in the romance that it caught me by surprise. in my case, i think it was a great cliffhanger. i‚Äôm so ready for the finale.i hope all that made sense! i don‚Äôt consider myself a ‚Äúhater‚Äù of this series. it‚Äôs not my favorite book ever, but i had a good time. i can‚Äôt wait to read the last one!QUOTES‚ÄúTell me, darling, do you think of me often?

Still here?Well, welcome,I welcome you to the most dull and useless book you are going to read in your life,this review is going to be completely spoiler-free,since I am not going to bother explaining what it is about or go into specific details, because to do that, something should have happened in the whole damn book, but it didn't, nothing, nada, nichts, niente. And for what? For such a shitty ending?I could literally spit on a blank page and the result would be better than this thing.I'm not going to lie to you, I'm speaking from anger and fury, because that's what this thing caused me. What's more, while I'm writing this I've decided to lower the score to one star,that star goes to Kai, because it's the only worthwhile thing about this book,him and his quotes and his flirtation.Let's start with the chronology, the first 8-10% of the book is fine, it starts off fairly strong, but from there, up to in my opinion 80% of the book, is a continuous loop of repetitive dynamics, the same thing over and over again. The last 20% of the book, okay, the dynamics begin to change,it was also time for the book to contribute something decent,but, after 300 pages of absolutely nothing, the end arrives, the tension grows and grows and keeps growing and the moment arrives and‚Ä¶‚Ä¶cockblock.The book focuses a lot on romance, but I can't believe I shoved this book down my throat in one day, to literally read 4 good scenes, a few flirtatious lines, and so that when the end comes, it's this absolute shit.I think the author wanted to surprise with the ending, and let's say she succeeded, but unfortunately, not in the way she expected. I felt violence inside me while reading the ending, and.. just why, Lauren Roberts? I think she saw all the complaints about how predictable and plagiarized the book was and said: oh yeah? Well you'll see, how about...this???The answer is NO, this is horrible, disgusting, harmful to look at.Well, after releasing the venom that I carried inside me about this atrocity, I can return to my hiatus of reviews due to the exams,will I read the third one?Well of course, firstlybecause I'm a masochist,obviously, and second because I need to know what the hell she's going to do after this mess.‡≥É‚ÅÄ‚û∑ ùìπùìªùìÆ ùìªùìÆùìøùì≤ùìÆùîÄ:04/07/24:this was a whole lot ofnothing!!im so fucking mad rn.02/07/24:ok let‚Äôs go üôÇ\u200d‚ÜïÔ∏è i have seen mixed reviews about this one already, i hope it‚Äôs better than powerless ü•≤""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'i have no words to describe how stupid that ending is and how excruciatingly boring this entire book was. i would‚Äôve have way more fun watching paint dry for 48 hours straight.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""|| 1.0 star ||This managed to be so much more disappointing than I could have ever imagined. I was really hoping the author would write the emotions, depth and angst well, especially after where she left off with the previous book, but she managed to do everything exactly wrong.First of all, I found it so off-putting that they kept on bantering with each other in every single situation, from beginning to end. They‚Äôre supposed to feel immense betrayal, yet they just keep on quipping quirky little one-liners towards each other? It‚Äôs not what I was expecting or hoping for. I wanted to feel the intensity and the angst between them; not this silly bit of almost-anger that hardly seemed to matter to either of them. Their entire relationship was just so superficial, it made me lose all interest in it.Even more: Where was Kai‚Äôs guilt? Where was his desperation to win back her forgiveness and affection? Sometimes his inner-monologue seemed like he cared, but he treated her so callously and cold. Like he didn‚Äôt even care that she hated him now‚Ä¶ He didn‚Äôt fight for her whatsoever.And she didn‚Äôt even seem to mind that he didn‚Äôt grovel or beg or show remorse; she weakly kept lusting after him anyway.Furthermore, I absolutelydespisedthe fact that Kai seemed to act like he had any right to anger. Like he was the one who should feel betrayed or hurt. He acted like she wronged him instead of the other way around. The hypocrisy of it all pissed me off so badly.She‚Äôs alluring in the way most deadly things are. It‚Äôs captivating. No. No, it‚Äôs terrifying. It‚Äôssupposedto be terrifying, still thinking of her as something I‚Äôm trying to deserve. Still deeming her worthy of my desire. But she‚Äôs not. No matter what has already happened between us. She‚Äôs my prisoner and my mission. She is nothing to me.Worst of all, the fact that Kai kept putting his ‚Äúmission‚Äù above saving her, loving her, earning her forgiveness, was insanely unattractive. Him acting like an aimless lapdog to his father and now to his brother was just pathetic.I mean, this dude has been slaughtering innocents for years because‚Ä¶ what? Because he couldn‚Äôt say a simple ‚Äúno‚Äù to his evil daddy? PATHETIC. And now he‚Äôs willing to do the same thing to the girl he ‚Äúloves‚Äù for the new king, his brother, just because he‚Äôs told to? PATHETIC.There‚Äôs seriously nothing less attractive than a man who‚Äôs willing to throw the girl he loves to the wolves because it‚Äôs his ‚Äúduty‚Äù to listen to his king. I mean, where is his duty toher? Where is his sense of courage or protectiveness?? Absolutely nowhere.‚ÄúOne landmark closer to my death.‚ÄùI look away to the street below us, not wanting to think about the possible truth in her words. I hate that I don‚Äôt know what Kitt plans for her. Or worse, what he plans for me to do to her.Is it bad of me to say I almost want her to end up with Kitt now? At least he was somewhat interesting and seemed to have actual emotions that went further than teasing and bantering. Most importantly, at leasthenever intended to murder her and give her up for his ‚Äúduty‚Äù. Nope, he‚Äôs just straight up going to save her and all the other Ordinaries by marrying her. Like, I‚Äôm sorry, but am I supposed to pick the guy who never fought for her and was willing to let her die (and even killed lots of other people just like her) over the guy who‚Äôs going against everything and everyone to have her as his bride and do what‚Äôs right? Because I think not. I‚Äôm going with Kitt here.My life is not my own. And, for that reason, she can never be mine.Anyway, this entire book was just a giant disappointing mess that didn‚Äôt even come close to living up to its potential. The whole thing was nothing but repetitive and silly banter; there was no actual plot or any form of development. Everything stayed the same from beginning to end, and we basically saw the same scene play over and over again. It was annoying, superficial and boring.The 'Powerless' trilogy:1.Powerless- 3.0 stars2.

Do you think I could have stopped it if I tried?‚Äù‚ÄúStop what?‚Äù‚ÄúStop myself from falling in love with you!‚Äù‚ÄúNo. No, don‚Äôt say that. I asked you not to make this harder than it had to be.‚Äù‚ÄúAnd I told you that it already is. Dammit, the minute you threw a dagger at my head, I knew I was done for. There was no longer a before you, only what I wanted with you.‚Äù‚ÄúAnd what could that possibly be? I‚Äôm an Ordinary. You‚Äôre Elite‚Äî‚Äú‚ÄúNot out here I‚Äôm not.

I think I would fall on my sword if it meant you mourned me, and it‚Äôs terrifying to think you hold that much power over me. You asked me what my favourite color was once. I‚Äôd never even pondered the answer to that question before you. And yet, I realized in that moment that it was blue. It is your eyes. Tell me you hate me, and I‚Äôll still count every heartbeat, every freckle, every shiver of your body, if only you say it with a smile. I may be a monster, but if you cut me, I‚Äôll bleed. And if you break my heart, Pae, you‚Äôll break me. So, if even a sliver of your soul longs for mine, I‚Äôll spend the rest of my life trying to deserve it.‚Äù‚ÄúMaybe you really are a poet.‚Äù‚ÄúOr just a fool for you.‚Äù‚ÄúPretend?‚Äù‚ÄúNever.‚Äù‚ÄúNone of it?‚Äù‚ÄúDarling, I have never had to pretend to want you.‚Äù‚ÄúWhat about our fathers?

And I hope you understand why I did the same.‚Äù‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I forgive you, Kai. I think I might have a while ago. Because I can forgive you for what you didn‚Äôt even know you were doing. I wanted to kill you. I wanted to be your undoing. But even then, I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be able to live with myself if I had.‚Äù‚ÄúOh, but you are my undoing. My deliverance.

Long, dark eyelashes‚Ä¶ Knowing what I need exactly when I need it. Ripping my dresses. Dimples that make me‚Äî‚Äú‚ÄúWith each kiss, he captures the three words I‚Äôm too scared to say. I hope he can taste them all on the tip of my tongue, read them on the curve of my lips. Because uttering the words feel like a death sentence. Every person I‚Äôve ever loved has left me. I‚Äôm cursed to lose in love. But that is what I feel for him, what I‚Äôve felt even when I hated him. Because hating him was easier than hating myself for wanting him. So i bite my tongue. I fight the urge to shout those three seemingly harmless words at him. Because wherever I love, people die. And I‚Äôd rather love him silently than mourn him loudly.‚Äù‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm sick of running. And I won‚Äôt spend the rest of my life doing it unless it‚Äôs you I‚Äôm running back to.‚Äù‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll spend the rest of my life tracking you down. Glimpsing you in the shadows. Fighting you in the streets. Dancing with you in my dreams. Because living without you is only bearable when I know you are out there still living too.‚Äù‚ÄúYou are my proof of a paradise.‚ÄùAND THAT PLOT TWIST AT THE END THOUGH??! üò≠üò≠üò≠ I HONESTLY SAW IT COMING. AT LEAST KITT DIDN‚ÄôT ORDER KAI TO KILL PAE OR ANYTHING, BUT STILL?? DOES THAT MEAN KITT WAS PART OF THE RESISTANCE ALL ALONG?!! HE WOULD‚ÄôVE KNOWN CALUM WAS A RESISTANCE MEMBER, RIGHT? OR WAS CALUM A TRAITOR?? I‚ÄôM HONESTLY SO CONFUSED üò≠‚ÄùLadies and gentlemen of the court, let me reintroduce you to who it is that kneels before you. This is Paedyn Gray. Once a contestant in the Purging Trials where she ranked quite highly for a Mundane. And to think a Psychic became such a threat to Offensive Elites. But she isn‚Äôt exactly what she seems. Not only was your Silver Savior an Ordinary in disguise, but she was a traitor under our noses. Paedyn, do you confess to not only being a Resistance member, but to conspiring with them as well?‚Äù‚ÄúYes.‚Äù‚ÄúNot only that, but do you admit to‚Ä¶ killing the former king of Ilya?‚Äù‚ÄúI do.‚Äù‚ÄúThis woman‚ÄîPaedyn Gray‚Äî has committed atrocious crimes. She killed my father, your king, plunging his own sword through his chest before her dagger through his throat. She conspired with the Resistance, a radical group of Ordinaries, helping them find a passage into the Bowl Arena. She lied. She killed. She betrayed. And I have grieved. I have stepped suddenly into the role of your king while still mourning the former. And, yes, my reputation as a crazed king has reached my ears. But I assure you that my future decisions are anything but crazed. And I will explain them all to you in due time. Paedyn Gray‚Ä¶ Stand. You are to be my bride.‚Äùi genuinely have no idea what to expect forfearlessnow, but istg if pae and kai don't get their happy ending, i will actually BAWL.‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm drowning. But not into her blue eyes like I happily would. No, I‚Äôm sinking into the floor, letting it swallow me whole. I can hardly breathe under the crushing weight of Kitt‚Äôs words. My ears ring. My heart pounds. The command echoes in my skull, though I have no idea why he would want this. Why he would want her. Not now. Not after everything. I‚Äôm surrounded by the entire court and the only thing I can focus on is not falling to my knees beside her. Marriage. Marriage to someone who isn‚Äôt me. Marriage to someone I will spend the rest of my life serving. I‚Äôll lose her forever while being forced to watch. I can‚Äôt even look at her. I‚Äôm a coward, morphing back into the monster I was when she found me. My vision is blurry, eyes fixed on the dais above. This is how I lose her. Not by death but by something just as binding. The command rings in my head. And to think I wasted so much time trying to hate her. To think I won‚Äôt have enough time to love her. My heart aches because every beat belongs to her. And I may never get to tell her that. Is this how she will remember me? Escorting her to this fate? Bound by duty alone? I could laugh. I could cry. I could burn this palace to the ground like I did her house, just for a chance to confess my love before the flames consumed me. Because I am bound to her very being. Hers until the day she realizes I don‚Äôt deserve to be. The king‚Äôs eyes are on me while mine are somewhere far away. Somewhere with her. A place where I am nothing and no one and happy being powerless, so long as she is beside me. My gaze falls from the fantasy, finding its way to her. This is not how I will remember us. Not as enemies or traitors or monsters, but as two people dancing in the dark, swaying beneath the stars. Her feet atop mine, her head on the heart that beats only for her. Just Pae and Kai. I step away from her kneeling form, masking every emotion with a blank stare. I‚Äôm leaving her to face him. Her future husband. I melt into the crowd, standing at a safe enough distance to prevent myself from stealing her away. This will be the rest of my life. Forced to love her from a distance. Mourn the loss of her each day. But I will. I will smother every emotion but the one that belongs to her. I will love her until I am incapable of the feeling. She is the torture I may not survive. Eagerly, she is my undoing. Her gaze lifts, meeting eyes that are not my own. Eyes of the man who gets to have her‚Äîif she allows it. She was supposed to be my forever. Now I‚Äôll watch her become someone else‚Äôs. Because the beast doesn‚Äôt get the beauty.‚Äùpre-read üåπüåø:I‚ÄôM SO FREAKING EXCITED AAAAHH!!!

",Hanya Yanagihara,4.31,747523,6355,"Fiction, Contemporary, LGBT, Literary Fiction, Queer, Mental Health, Adult",720,10-03-2015,"When four classmates from a small Massachusetts college move to New York to make their way, they're broke, adrift, and buoyed only by their friendship and ambition. There is kind, handsome Willem, an aspiring actor; JB, a quick-witted, sometimes cruel Brooklyn-born painter seeking entry to the art world; Malcolm, a frustrated architect at a prominent firm; and withdrawn, brilliant, enigmatic Jude, who serves as their center of gravity.Over the decades, their relationships deepen and darken, tinged by addiction, success, and pride.¬†Yet their greatest challenge, each comes to realize, is Jude himself, by midlife a terrifyingly talented litigator yet an increasingly broken man, his mind and body scarred by an unspeakable childhood, and haunted by what he fears is a degree of trauma that he‚Äôll not only be unable to overcome‚Äîbut that will define his life forever.","[{'rating': 3, 'content': ""5 THINGS I LIKED ABOUTA LITTLE LIFE(AND 5 THINGS I DIDN'T)Everyone‚Äôs talking about Hanya Yanagihara‚Äôs Booker- and National Book Award-nominated blockbuster novel. There are lots of 5 star raves on this site. Many people are saying it‚Äôs one of the most incredible books they‚Äôve ever read. I hate to be the outlier or considered cold-hearted (I‚Äôm not! I cry over books and movies ALL THE TIME!!!). The book took me just under 2 weeks to finish, and I‚Äôm glad I read it. I liked it, I really liked it! But I also didn‚Äôt. Here‚Äôs why.THINGS I LIKED1. The power of friendshipIf this book had a theme song it might be the Beatles‚Äô ‚ÄúWith A Little Help From My Friends.‚Äù Four roommates at an Eastern college move to the Big Apple and become huge successes: J.B. becomes a hip downtown artist; the well-off Malcolm is a well-known architect; Willem goes from waiter to movie star practically overnight; Jude is a lawyer, first at the D.A.‚Äôs office and then at a prestigious corporate firm, where he works himself up and becomes a partner.Over the decades, their friendship endures, through spats, early career struggles, J.B.‚Äôs drug addiction and, most of all, dealing with the effects of Jude‚Äôs unspeakably abusive past on his current life, although Jude is terrified to tell anyone about that abuse. The novel is also refreshing in its depiction of race, gender and sexual orientation.2. The depiction of the effects of abuseMy one major takeaway from this book is a fuller understanding of the after-effects of systemic childhood abuse. Jude, an orphan raised at a monastery, the first site of his sadistic stations of the cross, feels absolutely worthless. He cuts himself (if you‚Äôre squeamish, you‚Äôve been warned). He bangs himself against walls. In one particularly harrowing scene, he sets himself on fire. Beyond that, he can‚Äôt trust anyone and doesn‚Äôt feel he‚Äôs worthy of love, even though as an adult he gets nothing BUT unconditional love (with one notable exception). For the people who adore him (not just J.B., Malcolm and Willem but Harold, his former law professor, who, with his wife Julia, adopt Jude at age 30, and Andy, the most supportive physician on the planet), this is beyond frustrating. A good one-third to one-half of the book recounts all of that.3. The way Jude‚Äôs brutal past is layered into the storyYanagihara expertly weaves the story of Jude‚Äôs abusive past into his present-day narrative. And in the character of Brother Luke (especially), she understands how abusers manipulate.4. J.B.‚Äôs artThe descriptions of J.B.‚Äôs art projects, from his early, experimental pieces as a student ‚Äì one involves collecting people‚Äôs real hair ‚Äì to the shows that get him attention and fame, all feel authentic. My only question would be the scope and range of his work. The subjects of his art all seem to be his friends. Really? He has no other interests? Or is this merely a comment on #1 (above)? [Side note: the cover photo for the North American edition is brutally powerful: it‚Äôs called Orgasmic Man, and captures the feeling of ecstatic turmoil vividly.]5. The proseObviously a book has to be decent to keep you absorbed for over 700 pages. Yanagihara knows how to string you along. Jude has problems walking ‚Äì he‚Äôs vague in his description about how this happened ‚Äì and once she plants the idea of Jude‚Äôs abuse, she makes you wonder what EXACTLY happened to him. And as with any coming-of-age book, you want to know where they end up.THINGS I DIDN‚ÄôT LIKE (PLEASE DON‚ÄôT HATE ME!)1. The total lack of historical contextCharacters use the internet and cellphones, but no world events occur. The only things that register are the friends‚Äô cultural milestones: JB‚Äôs retrospective, Willem‚Äôs movies (which, incidentally, all have horrible, unlikely titles), Malcolm‚Äôs buildings, Jude‚Äôs cases. There‚Äôs something incredibly narcissistic about this. Seriously? Nothing on 9/11? The economic downturn didn‚Äôt affect Malcolm‚Äôs Upper East Side family? J.B. is of Haitian background; were any relatives affected by the earthquake? No one ‚Äì not one friend, colleague, etc. ‚Äì is dealing with HIV? (We‚Äôre told Jude‚Äôs body is riddled with disease, but never get the details.)2. The implausibilityNot only is Jude a top-notch litigator, but he‚Äôs also a brilliant mathematician. AND an excellent pianist. AND a singer of lieder. During school (full scholarship), he has a job at a bakery (oh, he‚Äôs also an amazing baker). So‚Ä¶ when - and HOW - did he learn how to play piano and study German art songs? Seriously. I want to know. What bothers me is the assumption beneath all of this. Does he have to be so good at all of these things for people to love him? If someone has been abused and ISN‚ÄôT as accomplished, isn‚Äôt this person just as worthy of love and understanding? For that matter, WHY do people love Jude? I don‚Äôt get it. All he seems to be doing for the entire book is saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù Which brings me to...Why are these guys all friends, again? Cuz they went to the same school? We don‚Äôt get enough about their early years to know what solidifies their friendship. Yanagihara just TELLS us they are friends, and we have to accept it. For 700 pages. Which brings me to‚Ä¶3. The RepetitionThe book needed more serious editing. It could have lost 250 pages easily. About ‚Öì of the way in, I thought, somewhat heartlessly (I know, I know), ‚ÄúImagine taking a drink every time Jude says ‚ÄòI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äô‚Äù I‚Äôd love to search how many times that phrase pops up, as well as the word ‚Äúshame.‚Äù Just saying. Weget it, Hanya.4. Lifestyle pornNot only do all four friends become enormous successes in their fields, but they‚Äôre constantly jetting off to exotic places (Paris for the weekend? Why not?!), buying up lofts (stylish and trendy downtown, of course, NEVER uptown) and having Malcolm decorate them in the best Architectural Digest taste. And then there‚Äôs the cultural snobbery. I howled when Willem was going to film Chekhov‚ÄôsUncle Vanyaand ALL OF HIS FRIENDS KNEW THE CHARACTERS FROM THE PLAY. I‚Äôve seenVanyaseveral times, and even I don‚Äôt know all the characters in the play.5. Black and white charactersI‚Äôm not talking about race, here. I‚Äôm talking about people who are either ALL GOOD or ALL BAD. We‚Äôre all somewhere in the middle, but not in Yanigihara‚Äôs universe. Which made me think that the book needs to be read as a fable, an urban fairy tale, not realism. Is that why there are no historic markers? Because this is some Dickensian book set in chic SoHo? I don‚Äôt know. But if these people who we spend so much time with had more shading, I‚Äôd probably have liked ‚Äì and BELIEVED ‚Äì it a lot more.***Final thoughts: obviously Yanagihara has tapped into something serious and profound with this book. I think people are responding to it because in some way we all feel damaged, used, unloved ‚Äì although not to the extent that Jude does. Most of us learn to overcome our insecurities and move on. He's that terrified child we all carry around inside ourselves, saying we're no good, we're not attractive, we're not worthy of love. I just wish all this had been done with a bit more subtlety. Life isn't so black and white. Yanagihara should know that, as we get older, we learn to accept, and live with, fascinating shades of grey. And that if she had brought out those complex greys, the book would feel more authentic and less sentimental.""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""Some believe that this is ‚ÄúThe Great Gay Novel.‚Äù That couldn‚Äôt be more wrong. There are only two recognizable gay men in this work, JB and Caleb. A creative queen and a violent, probably psychopathic, sadist. All the other ‚Äúpossibilities‚Äù are pedophiles (categorically not gay‚Äîthat‚Äôs a sickness, an evil, that has nothing to do with being gay) or so hopelessly confused (and impotent) that you can‚Äôt know what they are (JB and Willem). The take on gay men here is antediluvian‚Äîa dangerous and discredited brand of heteronormative delusion in which all gay men, no matter the glittering surface of their lives, are fated only to die a lonely, miserable death. Caleb dies an excruciating death (so we‚Äôre told) from pancreatic cancer. JB, the witty, flamboyant, unstable, creative queen is merely a plot point. His happiness, told but not shown, at the bitter end doesn‚Äôt mean anything more than that. He‚Äôs a device to wring one more regret from you, one more sorrow. You can be assured that he, too, will die an ignoble death just beyond this novel‚Äôs last page. And you won‚Äôt be troubled or offended or titillated by the gay sex (or really any sex) here because there isn‚Äôt any: it‚Äôs the sex that dare not speak its name. All this is because the author knows absolutely nothing about gay men other than the most superficial stereotypes and doesn‚Äôt have the imagination to venture deeper than that. She can‚Äôt even imagine that a man (Willem) doesn‚Äôt need a woman to quench his sexual needs‚Äîhe has a solution readily at hand.Some people believe this is a novel about friendship. That also couldn‚Äôt be more wrong. The author warns you early on [225] that friendship is nothing but the slow drip of miseries. This book is not about friends, it is about enablers. All the main characters are there specifically to enable Jude, which is precisely what destroys him. Were they his friends, they would never have let things progress the way they did.Some people believe that a strength of this book is that the author's presence is not felt. This also couldn‚Äôt be more wrong. There is absolutely nothing here that is not the author‚Äôs presence. It is all tell and no show. The characters are cartoons. They can‚Äôt grow. They can‚Äôt surprise. All they can do is grind the meticulous plot forward. They are not here for any other purpose. They aren‚Äôt really characters at all, just cogs in a machine.Every novel demands, by necessity, some suspension of disbelief. But no novel can be unbelievable. But that‚Äôs all we‚Äôre told. Four adolescents are thrown together as suitemates at a highly prestigious Cambridge college (wink, wink) and we‚Äôre told, not shown, that they effortlessly go on to become the best, the most famous‚Äîtrial lawyer, actor, artist, and architect. The actor and architect might squeak by as believable, but not the trial lawyer, not the artist. From what we‚Äôre told about the trial lawyer, it‚Äôs impossible to reconcile his catastrophic, constricted, precarious little life with the cold, predatory, expert were told he is. From what we‚Äôre told about the artist, it‚Äôs impossible to believe, even in New York City‚Äôs insular and provincial art world, that the same series of portraits from photographs of the same three men over and over and over again will raise him to the top of that art world. The artists, the real ones, the author cites are all mediocre; the one she tells surely must be likewise.Moreover, we‚Äôre told that that men, all men, have a permanent, genetic, stunted repertoire of emotion, have a tiny emotional toolbox. And that their character is fixed at some ill defined state in their past and beyond that no change can ever take place. Growth, change, redemption‚Äîall are denied. Thus, we don‚Äôt get characters, we get cartoons. Cardboard cutouts. They are here only to satisfy the deliberate plotting. They are only means to the author‚Äôs ends, nothing more.And to add to the unbelievability: the villains, puerile: the pedophiles‚ÄîCatholic clergy, Dickensonian orphanage counselors, a homicidal psychiatrist, long-haul truckers, a vast nationwide network of solitary and group child predators; and, of course, the brutal, violent gay psychopath. Even granting evil is banal, this is beneath banal. Cartoon. Cardboard. What‚Äôs lacking here, and elsewhere, everywhere in this novel, is any imagination beyond just that: the banal; the puerile; the stereotype.Not to dwell on the unbelievable, but it permeates this book. Nonexistent syndromes. Nonexistent legal cases. Hyenas that climb trees. And over and over and over the doctor, Andy: he fails every duty of care, everything that physicians stand for, believe in, dedicate their lives to‚Äîhe‚Äôs there only to enable. He doesn‚Äôt report what must be reported, not just legally but morally. And, of course, plot over believability, neither do any other of the medical professionals, doctors and nurses, a legion of them through whose care Jude passes. They all turn a blind eye to the evidence of his abuse, his self abuse. Andy neglects to mention the very real and virtually insoluble problem of phantom pain when he explains amputation to Jude, but then just that develops post-op, only to be brushed aside a few pages later. It doesn‚Äôt work that way. (And, really, it would have meshed perfectly with the author‚Äôs plot. Another failure of imagination?) And, fundamentally: physicians don‚Äôt treat their friends, their family. That‚Äôs a recipe for disaster. Unless disaster is precisely the aim.And I just can‚Äôt let it go: lunch at obviously Le Bernardin, Willem without a jacket. No way. No man dines there who is not wearing a jacket. And especially not an actor, no matter how famous. Here, I guess, the point where the author did let her imagination run wild.And I‚Äôd be remiss not to mention the language. Suited to its task. Occasionally it seems almost to take flight, but when it does, it seems more appropriate for a glossy travel magazine. And it almost always tries to take flight in just such a milieu: Bhutan, the Alhambra.Most people think that this 720 page novel is too long. Way too long. But imagine what it would be were it the size of most all contemporary novels, 250-350 pages, more or less. Half or less what it is now. What would it be? Even more obviously the ridiculous cartoon that it is. The length is intrinsic to this work. It is long, patiently and meticulously plotted. The very length is part and parcel of its purpose. The reader made to suffer, one with the gears of the plot. That‚Äôs the whole point.The leitmotif is sorrow. Everyone is always saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù Over and over and over and over again. Of course, thus sorrow loses all meaning, becomes trite. But meanwhile the author is carefully and meticulously adhering to the through line, everyone will suffer, every character, the reader. It‚Äôs nothing but melodramatic manipulation.So what is this after I‚Äôve rambled on about what it isn‚Äôt? I think it‚Äôs a masterpiece of a new kind, joining closely related genres such as mommy porn and the venerable bodice rippers: this is authorial sadism. The author is a ‚Äúliterary‚Äù (if you can dignify her as such) dominatrix. Every character set up to fail, no possibility of redemption, growth. And the person who suffers the most in the end is the reader. Set up to be crushed. Again: that‚Äôs the whole point.All of us are the stories we tell. No less the novelist.If you read this book and found it amazing, I‚Äôm sorry.If you haven‚Äôt read this book, don‚Äôt.""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Fuck this book.And it started out so well! The writing is actually gorgeous. I can see why many, many people like this book. Really, Hanya Yanagihara knows how to use language. Unfortunately, the story she told was not worthy of it. The longer I read this book, the more I dreaded reading it, the worse my feelings got as I read, and the more I hated it for existing. Then I read a bunch of interviews by her and hated the book even more.The long and short of it is that this book is nothing but misery porn, on purpose. (Here\'s a Vulture interviewwhere she talks about the inspiration for writing the book to create a book version of ombr√© cloth, which if you\'re not familiar, by the time you get to the end is pitch black. Yeah, let\'s make art that will stain our souls!!!!!)This book.Nothing in life is positive, there is only human suffering, true connection is impossible, predators will always find and ruin truly good people, everything is evil, the people who love you are not enough to save you, and your happiness will turn to ashes in your mouth. The End.Fuck. This. Book.There is a lot more that I could say about this book but I don\'t think I have enough time or space. Other people have criticized more articulately the implications of the way Yanagihara treats her gay characters, who exist seemingly only to suffer (while paradoxicallyothers have praised it as the great gay novel). She also stated in several other interviews her desire to write a character so broken he couldn\'t be fixed, which she accomplishes in her protagonist Jude. Some have called this a melodrama, and that seems accurate. Everything is over the top, but stated in such bald and beautiful prose that it doesn\'t feel that way at the time. Instead, these larger than life events are made to seem trite and commonplace. Yes, there are bad priests in the Catholic church. Yes, the church covered this up. Do I think it\'s likely that an *entire abbey* (the whole thing!) full of Franciscans (the most peaceable and loving sect in Catholicism) would not only participate in child molestation, but condone it openly? Hell no*. One more ridiculous thing in this book on top of another. If it\'s unlikely and causes Jude lots of pain, just put it in this book!*UPDATE 5/23/24: I am about three condescending comments away from closing my comments on this review altogether, but specifically please stop telling me that systemic abuse exists in the Catholic church, I KNOW IT EXISTS AND IT IS BAD. My point in referencing this is that it was just one more thing on top of everything else ridiculously implausible in this book that is taken way too far, and thus makes any eliciting of emotion impossible for me. I get that people like this book and it\'s their baby or whatever, but my not liking this book in no way harms you, a person who did like it. Stop condescending to me, thanks!The real deal breaker for me was when I paused midway through the novel to readan interviewwhere Yanagihara stated her criticism of psychiatry as a way to treat mental illness. The implication that some people are too broken to help and we should just let them die is so, so harmful, and in no way does it help to eradicate the stigma against mental illness in this country. We should not be telling ""broken"" people it\'s okay to die. We should be telling them they are not alone in their suffering, and help them find ways to cope with their illnesses and traumas. I will admit I checked out of the book then, and it was only a matter of time before I gave up and spoiled myself on the rest of it, so I wouldn\'t have to torture myself mentally any further.Glad I did, because the end of this book is a big rusty nail up the butt.This one from the London Review of Books ismy favorite review of the book I\'ve read so far. Let me quote my favorite part:""He wishes he too could forget, that he too could choose never to consider Caleb again. Always, he wonders why and how he has let four months ‚Äì four months increasingly distant from him ‚Äì so affect him, so alter his life. But then, he might as well ask ‚Äì as he often does ‚Äì why he has let the first 15 years of his life so dictate the past 28.""The answer, of course, is that it‚Äôs Yanagihara‚Äôs design. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs good to know that Jude is entirely her concoction, not a figure based on testimony by survivors of child rape, clinical case studies or anything empirical. I found Jude an infuriating object of attention, but resisted blaming the victim. I blame the author.A Little Life has received some ecstatic reviews. The most intriguing of these is the novelist Garth Greenwell‚Äôs in the Atlantic, which argues that it‚Äôs the long-awaited ‚Äògreat gay novel‚Äô: ‚ÄòIt engages with aesthetic modes long coded as queer: melodrama, sentimental fiction, grand opera,‚Äô he writes. ‚ÄòBy violating the canons of current literary taste, by embracing melodrama and exaggeration and sentiment, it can access emotional truths denied more modest means of expression.‚Äô Perhaps I‚Äôm in thrall to current literary taste, but the only character in A Little Life who seems possessed of anything like ‚Äòemotional truths‚Äô or a sense of irony, the only supporting player in this elaborately ethnically diverse cast who doesn‚Äôt seem like a stereotypical middle-class striver plucked out of 1950s cinema, is JB. He‚Äôs temporarily ushered out of the narrative after he says to Jude: ‚ÄòYou like always being the person who gets to learn everyone else‚Äôs secrets, without ever telling us a single fucking thing? ‚Ä¶ Well, it doesn‚Äôt fucking work like that, and we‚Äôre all fucking sick of you.‚Äô JB‚Äôs also the one hooked on crystal meth. What real person trapped in this novel wouldn‚Äôt become a drug addict?I think what makes the most angry about this book is that I do see flashes of brilliance in it. Images I loved, earned emotions. Early on in the novel, one character muses about being a guest in his own life. Another talks about photography in terms that made me stop in my tracks and pause the audiobook just so I think about what she\'d written. Later, the relationship between Jude and his adoptive father and the love his adoptive father has for him made me cry. But all of that doesn\'t matter, when the end result is what we\'re given.What it comes down to the fact that pain was the only point, and I think that is reprehensible.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""[1/28/24 update: If you liked this book, great.

Let‚Äôs not pretend otherwise. Conversations can be made without invalidating other people‚Äôs opinions.]I don‚Äôt want to read a book written by an able-bodied person on the suffering of a disabled person without the research and nuance. You are allowed to love this book (I don‚Äôt though) but don‚Äôt close your eyes to the fact that this is an able-bodied person writing about how a gay disabled character ‚Äúnever gets better‚Äù‚Ä¶. I don‚Äôt like what that says.Everyone keeps saying ‚Äúbooks don‚Äôt need to have a happy ending‚Äù and that‚Äôs why people dislike this book. But it‚Äôs not the reason? Atleast not for me. This book could have the saddest ending for all I care but what matters to me is how it got there. And reading through a friendship that we didn‚Äôt even get to watch grow, was not it.The biggest trigger warnings for this book is self harm, rape, (child molestation, child prostitution), suicide. Check the ending of this review for more. AndI don‚Äôt care if you consider trigger warnings as spoilers because keeping someone from experiencing episodes and relapses is more important to me than your ‚Äúplot twists‚Äù and your ‚Äúenjoyment‚Äù. It needs to be said and it needs to be normalized because I don‚Äôt want to imagine even one person going through what I went through reading this book, or worse. So I hope that if you‚Äôre hyping this book up and someone asks you why it‚Äôs so depressing, you can tell them about it‚Äôs trigger warnings and keep from openly saying that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúworth it read‚Äù. I‚Äôm tired of people recommending this problematic book so easily.this book should never be recommended lightly.And should be read by those who are in the healthy headspace to do so.I was wrong to think that this was going to be about friendship, it's not.which was half of the reason I started this, and the full reason why I thought I would still love it despite the endless list of all the most trigger-able content.I thought we were going to see the development of this friendship or at least get to know why their found family was/is as solid as it supposedly was. And we never got to see that.I really don't know why people keep emphasizing it but I'm here to tell you that it isn't and I was gravely disappointed when I realized what this book was really about. Some characters were used as plot points and some where used to make you feel guilty... at worst, they were added for the shock factor.Before I say anything else, if you didn‚Äôt already know,the author herself said that she wrote Jude without doing any research and that he came to her ‚Äúfully formed‚Äù. Given that the author isnot1. A disabled person and 2. A gay man bothered me the whole time I was reading this book. If you are going to write about mentally sick disabled gay man, you should at least do research about‚Ä¶ well, all of those if you‚Äôre going to be writing about highly sensitive topics. Most especially when you pack so many traumatizing things into one book.In another interview she said that the reason that she writes about men is because she thinks that they aren‚Äôt as good in expressing their emotions as women. And I don‚Äôt know with you but that‚Äôs a red flag to me.hmm‚Ä¶ so‚Ä¶ this was grueling to read and I was extremely triggered the whole time I was reading so there‚Äôs that. I read the trigger warnings about this book before reading it but i didn‚Äôt realize that it so strongly focused on self-harm and self-destruction as much as it did. As someone who has battled with self-harm, it‚Äôs going to be incredibly upsetting and hard to read if you aren‚Äôt ready. I know it was for me. No one really emphasized that part when I was going through reviews and I do see why since it could be seen as a ‚Äúspoiler‚Äù but I think we need to stop equating trigger warnings = spoilers. . It keeps people from having to read triggering content, like what happened to me, that could result to relapses. I could feel my mental health going somewhere I didn‚Äôt want it to.This book wasn‚Äôt for me but I know a lot of people loved it.

A Little Life exists in a nonsensical parallel reality where New York City exists in a constant ahistorical state of now, with no Gulf wars, no 9/11, and no humanitarian or environmental disasters, while the rest of America is stuck in the 1950s, but with full wireless internet access.If a Little Life were not bad enough in itself, the things Yanagihara has said about it make it so much worse. Yanagihara originally said she was only interested in writing about suffering, and that she had not done any research into child sex abuse. Later, she wrote a very condescending piece about 'Upsetting the Reader' as some kind of meaningful pursuit, and after that claimed to be fulfilling some kind of public duty by forcing us to confront the depths of human cruelty.Yanagihara has also said some very unpleasant things with regards to mental health and suicide, which, combined with the very unpleasant messages in the book about consent and victimisation, make the whole project morally dubious.It is very obvious that Jude is a puppet, created by Yanagihara to suffer, and suffer in very specific ways, and to that end the whole story is so contrived and nonsensical that it has no meaning, the only cruelty we learn about is Yanagihara's.The first contrivance is Jude himself, the idea that no one would want to adopt him as a baby makes no sense; he is described as having green eyes, skin that turns bronze in the sun, and straight brown hair, this apparently makes him 'too black' to adopt.Next is the monastery itself, that Jude was left there in the first place, when it was not set up as an orphanage, that he survived past infanthood, given how violent the monks were, that they didn't just call social services to come and take him away since they resented him so much, that an order dedicated to poverty resented the cost of one more mouth to feed, that an order of Franciscans spent no time praying or meditating or doing community outreach (the monastery is written more like a farm, I suspect Yanagihara did no research on that either), that all the monks are brilliant teachers in subjects like mathematics and Greek, that Jude never seems to have any Catholic faith to lose, despite being raised in a Catholic order.The shear incompetence of all the police, doctors, teachers and social workers who come into contact with Jude after he is rescued from Brother Luke is ridiculously contrived as well. Somehow he receives no psychiatric care after Brother Luke or after Dr Traylor, and he has incompetent doctors who don't understand child sex abuse, and who think it is appropriate to lecture a raped child about the need to disclose his STI status to future partners. The state school Jude attends while at the children's home takes enough of an interest in him to move him up four grades and arrange extra classes for him at the local community college, but takes no interest at all when he tries to run away and is beaten so badly he is hospitalised, and no one at the hospital sees the need to get the police involved either.Yanagihara created Jude to suffer in very specific ways, all the 'compensations' of his adult life are there to keep him alive and suffering longer (and really, who has such solipsistically dedicated friends in real life anyway?). At college, Jude meets Andy, a doctor willing to treat him privately and for free, thus avoiding any messy reality spilling in, or Jude being committed for his self-harming behaviour. Also, despite Jude's childhood abuse being filmed and photographed in the age of smartphones and the internet, none of those images reappear in his adult life, and despite being in a same-sex relationship with a Hollywood star, he is never chased by the paparazzi, and never has a reporter digging into his past.Even Jude's relationship with Willem is abusive, Willem is effectively raping Jude (Jude feels like he can't say no to sex, even though Willem is supposed to be his best friend), and it feels like it is only there to drag Jude's torture out to the bitter end.What is all this for, what does any of it mean? It induced an emotional response in me, I was left feeling like I had been passed through a meat grinder after reading it, but with hindsight and reflection, it's meaningless, it is wallowing in meaningless nonsensical suffering for it's own sake, and he tells us nothing about the human condition.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'A Little Lifeis a strong contender for the award for themost depressing book I\'ve ever read. I swear I\'m not even exaggerating.At this point, I\'m not certain whether this is a positive or negative review. There\'s no doubt that this book is beautifully-written and contains some of the most raw and honest prose I\'ve ever had the pleasure or misfortune of reading, but it\'s alongvery long character study - over 700 pages of misery, substance abuse, self-harm, sexual and psychological abuse (and its aftermath), with very little of that ""light"" promised in the blurb.There\'s a section of this book called ""The Happy Years"" and never has a title been more misleading, if you ask me. But let me give you some idea what this book is about first. It starts with four young friends moving to New York - poor and uncertain of themselves - and trying to make their way. The characterization of JB, Malcolm, Willem and Jude is, to put it plainly, marvelous.They are such complex, well-crafted individuals with their own passions, hopes and fears.While the book details the lives of all four of them, Jude finds himself at the centre of this story, influencing the lives of his three friends. The more you read ofA Little Life, the more you realize that it is really a novel about Jude, and the other three characters - though important - are secondary to the story of Jude\'s journey from a childhood full of sexual abuse to an unhappy adulthood.Those promised ""The Happy Years"" are some of the most heartbreaking chapters I\'ve ever read. I readanother reviewwhere the person said she had to put the book down because this part of the book was too close and personal. To quote the reviewer:I feel like someone shoved their hand in my torso and started stroking my organs while a therapist sits there observing and then asks me, ""now, how does that make you feel?""I know what she means. It\'s brutally, painfully honest. It makes you feel like you\'re witnessing something you shouldn\'t be in the relationship between Willem and Jude. And, by the way, it is one of the most interesting, strange and truly depressing relationships I\'ve ever encountered. The fear Jude feels that this relationship will be pulled apart by his own problems is palpable, and the lengths he goes to in order to conceal his issues made me so sad for him.But I can foresee the future onslaught of negative reviews that call this book ""torture porn"". It is so helplessly bleak. Everything bad that can possibly happen to Jude seems to happen and even when he finds someone to love him in his ""happy years"", that too is tainted by his past.Also, I find that very few books actually need to have this many pages. Almost all books over 600 pages seem too long to me, with many scenes feeling like they weren\'t needed and should be cut out. While I appreciated the depth of the character development, I\'m certain that at least 100 pages of this book could have been shed without losing any emotional punch. Some of the character development felt dragged out way too long; one instance that comes to mind is the descriptions of JB\'s art - from his time building models out of hair, to his paintings - I feel like my understanding of JB and his relationship with art could have been achieved in far fewer pages.This is one of those books that brings a whole lot of genius to the table but very little real enjoyment. It\'s long, slow in parts, and very VERY depressing. But if you are not put off by the length and the dark subject matter, I would say it\'s the kind of book that needs to be read. It\'s the kind of book people will talk about and it\'s the kind of book that has you saying ""this is the most ________ book/relationship/characterization I have ever read"".And that really is kind of amazing.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Tumblr'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I slept with this book after I read it. I kid you not: I held its bulking, hardcover bound 700 pages in my arms as I fell asleep amid a raging storm. I refused to letA Little Lifeleave me. Its brilliant writing, its broken characters, and its bleak, unforgiving story dug into my heart, into the very pores of my skin. As a twenty-year-old, I felt both so young and so old upon finishing this novel, as if its sheer humanity aged my soul while making me appreciate all the years I still have left.A Little Lifefollows four friends after they graduate from a small, prestigious Massachusetts college: Willem, a kind and talented actor; JB, a sharp and sometimes-caustic artist, Malcolm, an aspiring architect at a well-known firm; and Jude, a mysterious and intelligent litigator. What looks like an average bildungsroman turns into an intense and tragic tale when we learn about enigmatic Jude's backstory. Abandoned at a monastery at birth, he endured a childhood of severe physical and emotional abuse, followed by several years of sexual abuse, forced prostitution, and psychological trauma. The book soon hones in on Jude's struggle to free himself from the demons of his past, the hyenas that howl and drown out the voices of his closest, most beloved friends.This book is relentlessly sad and exquisitely written. Hanya Yanagihara spares us no mercy when revealing Jude's trauma. She details both his past abuse and his present self-harm with explicit specificity, her diction so precise and piercing it made me shake, and at times, sob. Yanagihara writes both Jude's suffering and his friendships with a keen eye. She captures the nuances of human emotion, physical space, and change over time with eloquence and heart. She writes about some of the most wretched, abominable acts of cruelty I have ever read without sentimentalizing any of the abuse or making any of the characters' feelings mawkish.Yanagihara offers us temporary respite from the pain within Jude's past by showing us the power of friendship.A Little Life's most affective moments come not from its graphic depictions of violence, but from its quiet, uplifting portrayals of compassion. While the many abusive men in Jude's earlier life show us the depth of human atrocity, Jude's tender, bittersweet relationships with Willem, Harold, Andy, and others offer to us mankind's capacity for kindness. All of these complex characters make mistakes, and through their imperfections shines their humanness.Please keep in mind:A Little Lifeis ruthlessly depressing. In the end, Jude really receives no reprieve from his anguish. As someone who has suffered his own abuse - a version less intense than Jude's, yet still real - and as someone who reads a lot about abuse, I appreciated Yanagihara's dedication to showing the darker side of reality. Trauma is trauma is trauma. And while we can all fight for recovery, sometimes that absolvement may never come. Sometimes, we just have to act with whatever kindness we have left and hope that it brings even a moment of light into the dark.Highly recommended to anyone who wants their heart both filled and destroyed.

Sometimes you just know.A LITTLE LIFE is a title with 3 meanings. First, it refers to its protagonist, Jude, a man who cannot ever accept that his life is worthwhile. Second, it refers to the act of reading it, spending time in this book is really like living a version of life.There is a third meaning, one that you don\'t discover until around halfway through the book when the title\'s words are used in a context that is like a punch to the gut. When you read them you may find yourself having a physical reaction, your stomach may flip, your skin may go cold, you may gasp for breath. And that is a lot of what the experience of reading this book is like. You can call these parts of the book words like ""awful,"" but to be real you\'d need to pull out your thesaurus and just line them up one after the other. This is not a book that is easy for your emotions. You care about the people in it, so the pain can really hurt you.You will hear that this is a book about 4 friends. It\'s not. They\'re a nice framing device, but this is a book about one person and the people who are connected to him. His life is made up of extremes. I found myself weeping over and over again because of the love and compassion and kindness that characters in the book displayed. But this book has some of the most harrowing and horrifying scenes I\'ve read anywhere. It is not really spoiling anything to say this involves terrible things happening to a child. Everyone knows from the very beginning that something bad happened to Jude when he was young. It\'s just so much worse than you could imagine. (If you have trouble reading about child abuse, it\'s probably best you not read this book. While it\'s essential to the story, it is not glossed over or referenced vaguely and what is described is truly terrible to contemplate.)Jude is not a new character. The damaged soul whose self-worth never really recovers is present in a lot of modern fiction. Yanagihara\'s trick, I think, is just how willing she is to plumb the depths of his darkness and its effects on those around him. She follows him for decades, observes him in all situations, and is unflinching in her depictions. Her writing is the kind of good that you can miss if you\'re not paying attention. You are so caught up in her story that it\'s easy to miss just how agile and careful the book is. It eases back and forth from character to character, backwards and forwards in time, and it never feels strained.I stayed up for hours to finish this book and then couldn\'t sleep because I couldn\'t let it go. I was overcome by the book and by the loss of finishing it.This is a book about love and what it means and what it can do and it is the humanity of its characters and their love for each other that will stick with me.If it was presumptuous to say this is my favorite book of 2015 since it tries to predict the future, I do feel that I can dig through the past and assert with certainty that this is one of the best books I\'ve ever read.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Note: I received an ebook copy of this book from the publisher for review consideration.Around page 150 of Hanya Yanagihara‚Äôs second novel, A Little Life, which follows four friends from their college years into their fifties, I wrote the following in my notes:I am more excited about Hanya Yanagihara and her work and her career than I have been about any author in a really long time.Around page 200 I wrote this:Is Jude‚Äôs suffering perhaps a tad overwrought? It is starting to seem like everything bad happens to him forever. Maybe we should spend some time with one of the other characters.Page 200 Jenny was right, and Page 150 Jenny was ‚Äî well, hope springs eternal, and maybe Yanagihara‚Äôs third book will be back up to the standard of The People in the Trees. But as for A Little Life, describing Jude‚Äôs suffering as ‚Äúa tad overwrought‚Äù is like describing Dolores Umbridge as ‚Äúa tad unpleasant.‚Äù Yanagihara employs a plot strategy of which I was very fond when I was eleven, which was to think of as many dreadful fates as I could and heap them upon my protagonist one after another. Then when I ran out of ideas, I killed the protagonist off and wrote heartrending scenes of her friends-and-relations mourning her wretched life and too-early passing. I did this because I was eleven. I am not sure what Yanagihara‚Äôs problem is.We learn early on that Jude is physically frail, due to an unspecified injury in his past, and that his family isn‚Äôt in the picture. Over the course of seven hundred pages, Yanagihara unfolds a cartoonishly woeful backstory to explain all of this. When you first start to recognize the way Jude‚Äôs abusive past is tearing him apart in the present, it‚Äôs heartbreaking. After two or three wicked villains have gotten through abusing him just because they‚Äôre evil, you start worrying that if the author doesn‚Äôt right the ship, you‚Äôre going to find yourself in the unenviable position of describing a depiction of child sex abuse as silly in your eventual review.The maddening waste is that Yanagihara‚Äôs writing is elegant and evocative, and she‚Äôs able ‚Äî at times ‚Äî to capture with precision and delicacy the true, messy emotions between her characters. And the kind of story that she‚Äôs (I think) trying to tell is a kind of story I want to see more of. I want a story that doesn‚Äôt pretend there‚Äôs a straight path out of trauma into healing that you travel once and then you reach the end and you and your trauma have no further business to transact. I want a story that places serious value on relationships other than romantic ones. I want a story about loving someone who cannot always see his way clear to continuing to live in this world.Ideally, of course, these stories would reach me unencumbered by several metric tons of lunatic melodrama, and I would not have to use the word dreck in reference to an author I admire. But in this I am evidently destined for disappointment.'}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt friendship its own miracle, the finding of another person who made the entire lonely world seem somehow less lonely?‚ÄùTwo months. Books usually don't take me this long to be read. Even long books don't. So what's the reason I was stuck with this book for so long?Let's see. The never ending suffering and pain. The exaggerated and gross cruelty. The sadistic hopelessness. That's why.I had such high expectations. And it would have been so easy to meet them. All I longed for while reading this book - and talking myself into picking it up and finishing it - was for the main character to find hope. Not happiness, I cancelled out that option pretty quickly, but the hope that happiness might be an option. Spoiler: He never found it.Now, we all know and love that kind of book, those epic and dramatic novels we read, cause they'll sweep us away and make us weep, make our heart ache. And we love those books cause we know they will mend our broken hearts again. We will suffer, but we're going to be happy about it.I expected to cry and weep a lot with this book. I had tears in my eyes, yes, but those were tears of desperation and hatred. Hanya Yanagihara abuses the main character maliciously, mistreats our feelings, and shows us how ugly and hurtful a single life can be.I'm not sure what people mean when they say this was a beautiful book. Possibly the prose? The setting? Sure as hell not Jude's story right? Sure as hell, not the fact that - spoiler - he literally gets fucked and crippled by countless disgusting and evil men, who make him believe that he is a worthless, ugly, non-deserving piece of trash for his entire life, so that he finally kills himself STILL convinced he is worthless, ugly and non-deserving.What kind of book is this. How far does an author have to go? Why does an author have to get so disgustingly graphic, so horrific?Yes, I admit, there were nice parts. Yes, I enjoyed the writing. Yes I loved the travels and the infinitely rich lifestyle everyone seemed to live, but which also made this book even less credible. Yes, of course, I celebrated Jude's achievements, friendships, his lucky moments. But all his lucky moments, all the love he deserved, all the friends he had, had to be taken from him. And this shattered my awe for and good opinion of this novel.This book was filled to the brim with queer pain, and frankly I'm not here for that. I don't think queer characters shouldn't be allowed to suffer, but they're owed a chance at happiness. No such luck here.Find more of my books on Instagram""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I can't, with a clear conscience, give this book anything less than 5 stars. It's a book that kept me reading long into the night, made me turn each page with vigor and curiosity, gave me chills and shivers over the joys and sorrows of each character, and ultimately left me feeling a bit older and tortured and yet at peace with the deeply complicated nature of humanity.What Hanya Yanagihara does withA Little Lifeis nothing nearly as pretentious as that paragraph above. Somehow in 720 pages, she manages to adequately--better yet, excellently--show and make the reader experiences the lives of these young men. The novel follows four boys who meet at college: Malcolm, JB, Willem, and the central and mysterious figure, Jude. It's truly Jude's tale, but Yanagihara ends up telling each and every one of the boys' stories with ease and genuineness that makes them real.Her prose is clean and honest and revealing of the many emotions that humans experience. It's never explicitly beautiful, not flowery or overwrought with adjectives or descriptors. But it has its own beauty that comes from its ability to convey these feelings, making youfeelevery pain or happiness that Malcolm and JB and Willem and Jude feel. It's some of the best prose I've read in a while (or ever read), and I wanted it to keep going on forever.There's so much more I could say about this book. About how it hurt me to read at times--because yes, there isverygraphic material (i.e. self-harm, physical, sexual and psychological abuse, drug use) that makes the reading cringeworthy in parts--about how I fell in love with so many wonderful people in this story, about how I learned empathy and sorrow and frustration and anger for and with each of them, and how if I were to write a book I would want it to have the essence of this one.The truth is, though, I can't recommend this book to people, not without knowing them very well. Because it's a difficult journey that I can't suggest everyone take. Don't take this book lightly. But if you do choose to read it, if you choose to flip to that first page, be prepared for something inexplicable and jarring, but resilient and beautiful and ultimately worthwhile.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is an excellent, maybe perfect book, and I will never recommend it to anyone.The edition I read is 951 pages long, and I read it in 24 hours.

I cannot recall another that so raised my ire. An √ºber leftist pre-meditated kumba-yah-waaah, plodding so far into the wimper-sphere that it could legitimately be considered an ironic harbinger of the kind of paternalistic elitism, against which middle America arose in vengeance, delivering us the worst leader in U.S. history.In this [Vulture piece] the author discussed how she was inspired to create a novel of ombr√© cloth. If you don\'t know, an ombr√© cloth is one that by the time you get to the end ispitch black. As Goodreads member Ashley says in her review, ""Yeah, let\'s make art that will stain our souls!!!""If I was writing this review as some sort of literary quasi-critic, I might give the book 3 stars for capable writing and full development of characters, as it thoroughly explores the devastating, lifelong impact of child abuse on the abused. According to Picasso said, ""art is the lie that enables us to realize the truth."" Unfortunately, the author\'s intentions were less than admirable in writingA Little Life.Whoever is looking for a book for enjoyment or edification: the ordeal in reading this was way more than I could bear. It is the saddest and gloomiest I\'ve ever read. A doctor who\'s read this book would have to strongly advise a patient suffering clinical depression to avoid the misery of reading it... at all costs.Understandably then--I think--when I found out that Ms. Yanagihara meant to toy with the emotions of everyone who read this, that she set out to write it in a way that would depress, oppress and dishearten unsuspecting readers, I was pissed. Would I go view a film if I knew the screenwriter\'s purpose was to inflict gratuitous pain and anguish? NO. This is different than emotions like cheer, fear, and sneers at irony. I know a horror movie\'s purpose is to scare, The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Apatow rom-coms are intended to cheer me, and movies like Gladiator and Braveheart to evoke and satiate my inner urge for justice and vengeance. I could think of novels if I had more time.Understand me when I say that I have nothing against books that are sad, if such sadness is organic to the story, Lord knows I\'ve read enough of them and they make me upset sometimes. Many I\'ve rated 5 stars. What I am referencing isintentional manipulation of emotions to compose the story tomanufacture pain. I like how Philip Roth explained the difference: ‚ÄúEverybody else is working to change, persuade, tempt and control them. The best readers come to fiction to be free of all that noise.Such deliberate machinations violate the implicit compact between readers and authors: for the former to keep an open mind and suspend disbelief in reading the novel, and for the latter to write a story as truthfully as possible, which means not deceptively attempting to manipulate the reader\'s emotions. To write the story with its fictive facts in a way that is honest, veridical, organic. Sure, the writer can sway with subtext and mood and motifs. Yet, I don\'t recall a writer, as did this one, who admits that her purpose in writing this book was to make the reader feel as awful and as sad as possible.Faulkner, no writer of uplifting books himself, said ""the writer\'s privilege"" is ""to help man endure by lifting his heart."" To be sure, I\'ve read plenty of sad novels (including some of my favorites); most of the great ones are, in one way or another, depressing. And yet, when I look back I can find something spiritually uplifting in each.Nothingin this novel lifted my heart.For these reasons, I\'m giving the novel 1 star. I only wish I had the option of zero.Also see: review from The London Review of Books [Review]:""He wishes he too could forget, that he too could choose never to consider Caleb again. Always, he wonders why and how he has let four months ‚Äì four months increasingly distant from him ‚Äì so affect him, so alter his life. But then, he might as well ask ‚Äì as he often does ‚Äì why he has let the first 15 years of his life so dictate the past 28.""The answer, of course, is that it‚Äôs Yanagihara‚Äôs design. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs good to know that Jude is entirely her concoction, not a figure based on testimony by survivors of child rape, clinical case studies or anything empirical. I found Jude an infuriating object of attention, but resisted blaming the victim.I blame the author.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Where to even begin reviewing this book? I just finished this book today, and I am so emotionally drained it's hard to put my thoughts into words.If I had to describe this book in one word, it would be devastating.

The main character Jude suffers trauma after trauma after trauma, which the author describes in heartbreaking detail.Despite this book's emotional pain, there are moments of hope, beautiful characters, and loving relationships. Maybe the coolest part of this book is that we follow Jude through his entire life. I have never ever read a book before where we get such a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of our main character's life.If you choose to read this book, proceed with extreme caution.

I can\'t do it anymore. I can\'t pick this book up and continue reading when every page is so painful. I can handle angst and drama-- and enjoy it most of the time! But this was ridiculous.I strongly caution those with chronic illness, mental illness or disability be very wary of this bookBecause it\'s not angst. It\'storture pornat the disabled character\'s expense.This is the story of three incredibly selfish ""friends"" who are mostly so pretentious they don\'t even resemble real people.""None of them really wanted to listen to someone else\'s story anyway, they only wanted to tell their own.""^this consistent determination to be the center of attention isnotfriendship. It\'s selfish and down right narcissistic. It meant these ""friends"" consistently saw their friend struggling andnever reach out or intervene.Even worse,Jude\'s \'suffering in silence\' is glorified.This deals with extremely sensitive topics (this entire book is a trigger warning) such as rape, chronic pain, self harm, and suicide. It\'s obvious from the first chapter that Jude is suffering and his mental health continues to deteriorate-- but he never asks for help and his friends never intervene. In fact, those who reach out or \'complain\' are seen by the main characters as \'whiny\' or \'crazy.\'This establishes the extremely harmful narrative that asking for help makes you an annoyance.It\'s not accurate. It\'s not how friendship works. There\'s nothing noble about suffering alone. Friends support each other and if you need helpit\'s okay to ask for it.Beyond that, it\'s not even particularly well written. The character\'s main traits are their selfishness and pretentiousness, and other than that they fall painfully flat.The characters are essentially pawns for these heavy plot devices.Because those heavy topics I mentioned earlier? The sexual assault and chronic illness? That\'s all they are here--plot devicesso we can watch as things get worse and worse and worse and see characters lose the will to live.There\'s even aninterviewwhere the authorbrags about doing very little research:""No, I didn‚Äôt do any research; Jude came to me fully formed, and writing his sections were always the easiest. He‚Äôs a very consistent character ‚Äî or is meant to be ‚Äî which is, arguably, part of what dooms him.""Also where we see why her characters lack emotional depth (becauseallmen do, silly!)""I am not that interested in abuse really. But what I am interested in as a writer is the long-term effect it has, particularly in men. I think women grow up almost prepared for it in a way...But I do think that men, almost uniformly, no matter their race or cultural affiliations or religion or sexuality, are equipped with a far more limited emotional toolbox.Also:""I hope that the narrative‚Äôs momentum and suspense comes from the reader‚Äôs growing recognition ‚Äî and [spoiler\'s] ‚Äî that he‚Äôs too damaged to ever truly be repaired, and that there‚Äôs a single inevitable ending for him.""I can\'t tell you how harmful it is to present this narrative that people can be ""too damaged"" and (slight spoilers?) that suicide is the only answer. It\'s not just incredibly misguided it\'sactually incredibly damaging.In summary:this is a book where the main character is applauded for suffering quietly. It establishes a narrative where he can\'t ask for help-- and then sadistically pushes the story to a tragic ending. Because why? Becauseart?Buddy Read withFaye!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'A Little Lifeis a powerful, disturbing novel. It\'s full of pain, desperation, and a sense of isolating sadness that sucks the reader into some very dark places. It\'s also the best book I\'ve read in years.Reading the blurb, you\'ll get the idea that this work is about 4 college friends and their lives, but that\'s not entirely true. While each of the 4 main characters, and in fact all the characters in the book, are fully realized with extraordinary character development, the book is really about just one man, Jude St. Francis.Jude is a truly broken person; he\'s been broken by a childhood that is both a series of horrors that are difficult to read about and a testament to what a human being can endure. Jude doesn\'t come out of his childhood whole and I feel a little broken by having read about his life. I also feel that strange happiness that comes from being emotionally purged in the way that only great books can accomplish.As Alona mentioned in herreview, this is not a romance, but it is a love story. It\'s a love story about friendship that tries to overcome pain, and the bravery and sacrifice that true friendship and love sometimes require. The romance in this book is a beautiful one, but not in the traditional sense that a reader might expect or want for the characters involved.We all often say that we loved this character or that character in one of the many books that we read, I know I say it often, but the character of Jude St. Francis is something special. I loved Jude more than I\'ve loved any character before; that\'s probably why he was capable of so thoroughly breaking my heart. I wanted so much for him, I wanted him to be so much and get so much in life. He didn\'t get all that I wanted for him, but in the end, I was satisfied with where he ended up and it seemed fitting and very real.I hate the term ""triggers"", but it\'s appropriate here. I have a few triggers of my own and they were part of this book, but I felt the writing here just brought me into those places that I don\'t like to go and left me, not upset or feeling traumatized, but more appreciative of my own ability to survive and thrive. I wanted to reach into the book and take Jude\'s hand and tell him we\'d get through it together.This book is definitely not for everyone, but if you\'re up to it, you\'ll be thrilled by the writing. There\'s pain here, and beauty along with it.Big thanks to Alona for the many messages we exchanged while reading this. It sounds silly, but I feel as if the two of us have survived something together.'}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""Gave it a shot; not for me, although it may work well for others as the prose is quite inviting and the world dense and inhabited.

Better if you read the series in order.Story Synopsis:Millie is back, still working as a maid, and still struggling for finances. She is in a steady relationship with Brock, a lawyer who doesn‚Äôt know anything about her past. Not that she loves Brock, but as Enzo isn‚Äôt around, he will do.After Millie loses her current job, she gets a call from Douglas Garrick, a wealthy tech specialist. He wants Millie to clean and cook, but on one condition|: she is NOT to interact with his wife Wendy, who is ill. As Millie is desperate for a job, she agrees. However, things are, but obviously, not as declared, and Millie finds herself in a quandary; risk her job by helping Wendy, or go against her values by ignoring what‚Äôs happening?The book comes to us in the first person perspective of two of the characters, one being Millie.This sequel doesn't exactly continue from the end of the first novel, but provides enough of context to help us bridge to the events of this book. Though this can work as a standalone, I recommend you read the series in order, because Millie‚Äôs personality is much better explored in the first book.Since I complain about Bookouture blurbs quite often (Sorry, Bookouture! I still love you though!), I think I should also give them credit when they nail the task. The blurb of this book is spot on, revealing just as much as needed and creating enough interest without spoiling the fun or misleading. Good job!On the pro side, the story has every positive element that was present in the earlier book:üëâ Quick-paced writing.üëâ A storyline that keeps you invested even when you know what‚Äôs to come (or so you think.)üëâ An intriguing prologue.üëâ Characters who say one thing and do something else.üëâ Twists ‚Äì some foreseeable, some out of the blue.üëâ Some funny moments, courtesy Millie‚Äôs snide remarks in her first person pov.üëâ An ending that works well for the story.On the flip side,‚ö† The pattern of the book is exactly the same as the first book. (And many other thrillers.) So the minute the prologue began, I knew it was not narrated by whom we would assume it to be. The appearance of the second character‚Äôs pov created a huge d√©j√† vu moment, as I knew it would contradict everything Millie had told us so far. I was still interested in the proceedings; it is just that instead of enjoying the story as a fresh tale, I found myself playing detective and figuring out the twists based on the similarity to the first book.‚ö† Millie didn‚Äôt endear herself to me this time around. Her attitude towards Brock was quite irksome, and her thoughts very repetitive. While she shows her true spirit by the end, I wish it had been more evident throughout.‚ö† The writing is also somewhat basic, though, to be honest, I don‚Äôt read a thriller for its prose. But the overdose of foreshadowing and the back-and-forth rambling by Millie were somewhat disappointing.All in all, this is still gripping enough to provide an entertaining ride. I liked the first book much better as it had plenty of dark undertones. This one offers standard fare in comparison.I finally have the chance to use a phrase so many of my reviewer-friends do: it‚Äôs a popcorn thriller! Treat it as such than as a literary classic. As long as you read it with your logical side kept aside, you can have fun with it.3.5 stars, rounding up as it allowed me to complete it within a day.My thanks to Bookouture and NetGalley for the DRC of ‚ÄúThe Housemaid's Secret‚Äù.

Clunky, repetitive writing. Cringey dialogue. Predictable plot with a ‚Äútwisty‚Äù part 2 retelling the same boring story from another perspective. Skip this.(( SPOILERS BELOW ))................................(( SPOILERS AHEAD ))....................(( LAST CALL - SPOILERS ARE COMING ))..............................(( HERE ARE THE SPOILERS ))..........After the events of The Housemaid, our girl Millie has earned a reputation among rich white ladies as someone who can take care of business (ie help them get away from their shitty husbands AND clean their houses and babysit - she‚Äôs the full package). Despite all of her Good Samaritan-ism to the uber-wealthy (because who needs help more than the 1%?), Millie is still super poor and struggling. So poor that she is forced to live in the South Bronx! THE SOUTH BRONX!Millie‚Äôs hot Italian groundskeeper boyfriend and Samaritanizing associate Enzo has a-gone-a back-a to-a Sicily to a-take-a care of his a-dying mama so Millie is living alone in her SOUTH BRONX apartment. But she has inexplicably scored herself a super hot and rich and nice lawyer boyfriend named Brock (which, side note: omfg don‚Äôt name a character BROCK, unless he‚Äôs, you know, a rapist swimmer douchebag), who loves her soooooo much and wants her to move into his swanky apartment OVERLOOKING CENTRAL PARK because he‚Äôs ready to settle down because of his heart condition (?) even though they‚Äôve only been dating for six months and Millie stands him up constantly and doesn‚Äôt seem to even remotely like him as anything other than an abstract concept. She also hasn‚Äôt told him about her past, but really, really means to, eventually. But until then, she‚Äôll just act shady AF and keep skipping their dates. Sounds like a solid plan.Millie gets a new job cleaning for another super-rich couple, Douglas & Wendy Garrick, who live in a fancy PENTHOUSE APARTMENT on the UPPER WEST SIDE, JUST WEST OF CENTRAL PARK which is super different from her poor person neighborhood (the SOUTH BRONX in case you‚Äôve forgotten). Douglas seems vaguely hot-ish in a rich guy way, but Wendy stays hidden away in a guest room. Uh-oh.Then Millie thinks she‚Äôs being followed and she gets attacked by her skeezy neighbor dude (in the stairwell of her apartment in the SOUTH BRONX) and she stands up Brock a few more times and buys some weird rich people groceries for the Garricks. Then she sees Wendy with a busted up face and at some point Millie gets Wendy out of the PENTHOUSE APARTMENT ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE and to a cheap motel that is even worse than the SOUTH BRONX, but Douglas finds her and brings her back to the PENTHOUSE APARTMENT and continues to escalate the abuse.Then it turns out the person following Millie is none other than-a Enzo! He‚Äôs-a back-a from-a Italy and his mom is dead so he thought stalking Millie was the best plan to restart their relationship. He calls Brock ‚ÄúBroccoli‚Äù 197 times, and it was funny-ish the first time, but it got old real quick, and his accent a-comes and a-gos and he speaks grammatically perfectly for a few sentences and then-a goes-a back-a to not understanding English. It‚Äôs a real-a rollercoaster.Anyway, the two of them hatch a plan to save Wendy. Blah blah some stuff happens and Millie shoots Douglas and he‚Äôs dead.But.Then.The twist.The dude Millie shot is not Douglas! The real Douglas is a schlubby goober and not the handsome-ish man Millie killed. Oh dear.So then we have part 2, told from Wendy‚Äôs perspective. Turns out, Wendy is a gold-digging skank who only married schlubby Real Douglas for his money. She has an affair with Fake Douglas, who is married to Real Douglas‚Äôs secretary, Marybeth. Wendy and Fake Douglas make a plan to kill Real Douglas for his money‚Ä¶ and to frame Millie for his murder, which really seems like a lot of trouble to go through.Jesus H. Ok. So, the gun Millie shot was full of blanks. Fake Douglas was fake dead, so then Wendy killed Real Douglas and made him real dead. Millie hides from the police because they are after her. Wendy and Fake Douglas go to his wife Marybeth‚Äôs remote cabin to hide out and do some hot-tubbing, but then a very angry Marybeth shows up and Fake Douglas gets his throat slit (!!) and Wendy gets killed with digoxin heart pills and is forced to write a suicide note explaining everything, so now Millie is off the hook. Yay.Then we jump ahead a few months, and Enzo is muscularly moving into Millie‚Äôs SOUTH BRONX apartment, and then Broccoli shows up to to pick up a box of his shit, and I guess it‚Äôs another twist that Millie gave Broccoli‚Äôs heart pills to Marybeth and that‚Äôs what killed Wendy.So, now Enzo and Millie live together in the SOUTH BRONX, and I guess she‚Äôll find another cleaning job?

The fact she keeps on using Brock??? Like girl just stop please. I feel so bad for him throughout the book. If you don't want someone or don't love someone, just let them go!! Her inner monologues are so repetitive.Then comesWendy,I HATED her so much. She is such a narcissist, all I wanted was Douglas to just tell her her reality and find a life of his own. I wouldn't even mind if her pathetic little gold digging arse got killed off in a brutal manner.

Like UFFF I was in the edge of my seat and I would be lying If I said that I didn't enjoy it because I did. It kept me hooked throughout, so I have to praise freida for that atleast and the plot for this one was really well thought. I liked how everything was set up and how everything wrapped up. However, there were some plotlines that were weak but I would say I liked how strong part 1&2 were even part 3 till it's middle but from there onwards it started to go spiraling down.Millie was very annoying here. Too nosy for her own good and treated her bf like shit who was nothing but good to hear and had the audacity at the end to say that he left her when she needed her the most while she wasn't even present for most of their relationship, this part of Millie's actions was so infuriating but her being nosy and extra curious while working for Douglas was actually very smart from Freida's part because it completely took my attention from one thing and i broke my one rule üò≠ but anyways, I enjoyed reading abiut Millie and by the end I didnt mind her being annoyingly curious or nosy because it served a purpose but the way she treated broc üôÑüôÑ bffr Millie, bffr.As for the plot, I think Freida did a really good job at some parts especially the twist because I was not expecting that and I did enjoy it a lot but I found the start to be a little slow and part 4 to be very underwhelming and there was one thing that I'll discuss below that made no sense to me but other than that I liked the whole story.SPOILERS‚ÄºÔ∏èSo my one rule about reading thrillers is the first suspect is never the culprit and I broke it here üò≠üò≠ by suspecting Douglas and hey I have to blame Millie's annoying nature because iw as so annoyed at her being nosy and all and with how Wendy (what a bitch tbh) and her constant gaslighting that I thought it was really Douglas üò≠üò≠üíÄ until part two üíÄ where my jaw was literally hanging on the floor. Wendy was one twisted woman like she was so insecure and tried to justify so many of her actions and pls the way she murdered Douglas at the end like üò≠ my man just wanted to live a happy life but no you were too greedy and were trying to be so posh üôÑ like stfu bitch anyways, Wendy got what she deserved but hats off to her for orchestrating everything also her audacity to cheat and destroy another marriage?? üò≠ Wow. Loved Douglasbecuase he had two balls and one brain to actually exclude Wendy entirely from the will. Now see this part one and two which was amazing but then comes part three where everything was not that much drawn out and then we get to the resolution and??? How??? Why??? Myrcabeth? Was that her name? It made no sense how a secretary managed to slit her husband's throat and also kill Wendy because üò≠ like ik they both were having an affair but still it was so out of the blue and I didn't like it that much, it didn't feel satisfying. I also DO NOT understand like this made ZERO SENSE to me how when myrcabeth (wtv her name is) was making Wendy write a letter where she confessed to framing Millie and where she accused her of killing her husband and also herself, I didn't understand why she didn't say no because that way Wendy may have had a chance to escape or take down both millie and myrcabeth like why would she write that she was attempting to kill herself knowing that myrcabeth would kill her üò≠üò≠üò≠ where she could bribe her way out or take them with her.

After loving everything but the ending of ‚ÄúThe Housemaid‚ÄùI dove right into the sequel ‚ÄúThe Housemaid‚Äôs Secret.‚Äù Although I always enjoy Ms. McFadden‚Äôs fast paced writing style, I didn‚Äôt enjoy ‚ÄúSecret‚Äù near as much as its predecessor. The primary distinction between the two books, in my opinion, was the tone of the book. ‚ÄúSecret‚Äù seemed to be written in a tounge-in-cheek style that began to grate on my nerves the more I read. For instance, at the very beginning of the book Millie gets fired from her job because the baby she was the caretaker for called her mommy in front of the baby‚Äôs real mother. It was written so over the top I couldn‚Äôt believe the author wanted me to believe this was a real scene in the book. Many other scenes (even ones depicting violent acts) were written so unrealistically, I never became invested in any of the characters. Because of the tone I would rate the book as just average even if I was able to fly through it. At times it felt like I was reading an early rough draft of the novel as the scenes were described in a bare bones style that were over before they could build any suspense. I never felt this way about ‚ÄúThe Housemaid.‚Äù As you could probably tell from my very disjointed review, I had the hardest time explaining what I didn‚Äôt like about the book. The whimsical writing style on what could have been a great sequel to a great book left me unimpressed. I will definitely read Ms. McFadden again because admittedly her books are never boring and I‚Äôve never had an issue with the tone of her books as it relates to the story before. Please be kind in your comments when you tell me how delusional I am in not liking the sequel as well as ‚Äú The Housemaid.‚Äù'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Book Two3.5 üçøSTARSMillie is back and cleaning for a new wealthy couple,the Garricks.

OUT February 2023'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""‚ÄúThe Housemaid's Secret‚Äù by Freida McFadden is another classic psychological thriller that will have everyone talking about it in 2023. A little backstory, ‚ÄúThe Housemaid‚Äù was the first novel I read by her and I was instantly hooked. She is an exceptional author as I‚Äôve read some of her other books as well but I was anxiously waiting for the sequel to ‚ÄúThe Housemaid‚Äù because it was one of the best novels I read in 2022.Now, before I jump into my review, I want to let you all know about two trigger warnings in case they could affect you while reading. McFadden does a phenomenal job not describing anything in any kind of detail which is great but there are insinuations of violence against women and self-harm. Again, nothing is too detailed or graphic, just insinuated so I wanted to give everyone a heads-up about that. McFadden gets major props from me for not going into any specifics in both potential trigger warnings.I was very happy to get right back into what is going on with the main protagonist Millie since the ending to ‚ÄúThe Housemaid‚Äù was pretty wild. Millie is awesome and I truly loved all the New York vibes in this novel. Being born and raised in Queens, NY, I loved all the references, especially to the NY Mets. It just felt so authentic and added another layer of immersion to this novel for me being a New Yorker and all.Besides that, all the little references to the first book in this series were also brilliantly done. I‚Äôd recommend reading the first one and then jumping right into this one to see what I mean. McFadden is a great storyteller that delivers some incredible suspense, mystery, tension, and my goodness, her plot twists are on a whole other level. She‚Äôs fantastic when it comes to them and they will literally have your jaw on the floor with how crazy they are once revealed. That‚Äôs exactly what happened to me and I still can‚Äôt believe them.This sequel delivers in ways only McFadden can conjure as it‚Äôs another incredible psychological thriller of a read. I love how all of her books are so fast-paced and addictive, you simply can‚Äôt put them down even if you tried. Her writing is so seamless that this novel was a genuine page-turner, especially when you get to the second half towards a crazy ending I never saw coming. Seriously, I‚Äôm still completely blown away by the ending.I give ‚ÄúThe Housemaid's Secret‚Äù by Freida McFadden a perfect 5/5 as it‚Äôs another amazing novel by her that I‚Äôd highly recommend to anyone that wants a wild psychological thriller with crazy plot twists, mystery, and an incredible reading experience. McFadden is truly making a name for herself and I look forward to reading every single thing she‚Äôs written and all her future novels. She‚Äôs that magnificent and is an author I look forward to reading for many years to come.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""After thoroughly enjoying the first installment, I eagerly dove into this book, hungry for another whirlwind adventure in the world of Millie the maid. I can't help but keep my hopes high for the next installment, perhaps one where we follow Millie the social worker, assisting individuals caught in tumultuous relationships and dealing with dangerous spouses who mistreat their significant others. Personally, I'd love to see the narrative shift to focus on a husband's perspective in the second half of the book.I've come across several comments stating that the second book doesn't quite match the excellence of the first. However, I don't entirely agree with this sentiment. There are still incredible twists in this book that caught me off guard‚Äînot just one, but three brilliantly executed twists that took me by surprise. The first twist, while slightly more apparent, is not due to the author giving it away but rather because the book's concept encourages readers to think outside the box, fostering doubts about everyone's motives and leading us to suspect every move made by the other characters, all in an attempt to deceive us (or perhaps not-so-poor Millie, who retains her big heart to help others).In this new book, we find ourselves nearly five years ahead, witnessing the developments in Millie's life.At the end of the first book, she embarks on a journey to work in special homes, thanks to the highly-regarded references from Nina. Her mission is to aid housewives who have endured abuse at the hands of their husbands.Yet, within a few years, it appears that Millie has distanced herself from this perilous business. She particularly feels the void left by her partner in crime and her lover, Enzo, who had provided crucial resources to help abused women. Enzo's abrupt departure to Sicily to care for his ailing mother, coupled with his reluctance to specify when he'll return, leads to an amicable parting of ways. Millie begins dating Brock, a kind and caring lawyer with a critical heart condition who is eager to tie the knot soon. She also juggles cleaning and nannying jobs that come her way through word-of-mouth recommendations. Furthermore, she embarks on a journey to become a more effective social worker by enrolling in social psychology classes at a community college to better assist those in need.However, her latest gig ends abruptly when a misunderstanding with a child results in Millie being mistaken for the child's mother. The child's self-centered biological mother takes offense, leading to Millie's dismissal. Faced with no other options and fortunately without the need to move in with Brock (not broccoli), Millie manages to secure a promising job at the last minute. Douglas Garrick, a wealthy and influential business magnate, hires her to maintain his sprawling duplex penthouse, which he shares with his wife. Unfortunately, his wife's severe health condition confines her to her room for the majority of the day. The penthouse is largely spotless, with minimal chores for Millie‚Äîdusting, laundry, and preparing meals from recipes featuring obscure ingredients she's never encountered before. However, the pay and conditions are too tempting to refuse, and as the saying goes, beggars can't be choosers.Millie's plan is simple: follow her employers' instructions and avoid getting entangled in any family drama. But when she stumbles upon bloodstains in the bathroom and uncovers the reason for Wendy Garrick's seclusion‚Äîa battered and bruised face‚Äîher anger ignites. Despite the faint warning voice urging her to stay away from the family's issues, Millie can't resist intervening. Wendy Garrick, trapped with a monstrous husband, desperately needs saving, and Millie is determined to do everything in her power to rescue her. However, this time, the villain she confronts may prove to be more formidable than she ever imagined. To make matters worse, a relentless stalker is watching her every move. Is this threat connected to the Garrick family, or is something even more sinister lurking in the shadows, poised to threaten her life?Anticipating the big twist due to the first book's concept, I found the execution of these twists to be incredibly clever, with certain aspects even surpassing those in the first book. Upon finishing the book in a single sitting, I was so close to screaming and demanding another installment! I'm keeping my fingers tightly crossed that Freida McFadden won't keep us waiting too long for the next dance‚Äîor perhaps many more dances‚Äîin Millie's thrilling adventures. These books have become my new addiction, and I wholeheartedly recommend them to any reader in search of riveting, exhilarating, and breathtaking page-turners.I'm upgrading my rating from 4.5 stars to a solid 5, thanks to the clever twists, and eagerly looking forward to delving into more of the author's twisted tales sooner rather than later.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Dare I say that I liked this book more than The Housemaid?!

She needed someone more exciting and considered him boring and too predictable.Millie has a great deal of sympathy for abused women and will do anything to ensure they escape from harmful situations and by using any means necessary. Unfortunately, she often goes too far, further complicating the situation. She felt greater entitlement this time, and I found her more annoying.She is working in a fabulous penthouse apartment owned by a wealthy man. The home is immaculate, with little cleaning necessary, only cooking, laundry, and shopping for groceries. Her wages are generous.

She goes on several interviews but then is contacted by Douglas Garrick, a wealthy tech genius to clean and cook for him and his wife. The only rule is to not go into the guest bedroom or bother his wife.She can hear Mrs. Garrick crying the guest room and soon convinces Mrs. Garrick to open the door to her.

Just when I thought I had things figured out, McFadden shocked me with brilliant twists and turns. This book was a well written fast paced thriller which I devoured.If you have not read,The Housemaid, I highly recommend it. This book does work nicely as a standalone but reading the first book gives you more insight into Millie and her need to help others. Millie is an interesting and fully fleshed out character. She has a prison record and takes whatever jobs she can to make ends meat. She it tough and vulnerable at the same time. She also tends to get into some interesting and tense situations.I found this book to be captivating, well thought out, perfectly paced and tense.

It feels like it has been forever but it‚Äôs so lovely to be back with this crew.Heartstopperhas always plunged into difficult yet relatable subjects and this fifth volume is no different. Oseman has always done an excellent job at crafting her characters to feel like authentic teenagers and here we get to witness them growing up a bit more and heading into the next stage of life: college. We also get to experience Nick setting out in the world on his own while Charlie is back at home and even after 5 marvelous volumes I‚Äôm always thrilled to find the characters reading as increasingly nuanced yet still familiar. Going away to college issues were addressed in Oseman‚Äôs much earlier novellaNick and Charlie, and while this touches on some similar themes this is a completely different story.Though college isn‚Äôt the only hurdle here, as anxieties about sex dominate a lot of Charlie‚Äôs narrative. As always, Oseman does a great job at representing these issues in an age-authentic way and the character‚Äôs emotions practically jump right off the page. There‚Äôs some other interesting dynamics to this story too, from discussions on asexuality and also a peek into Charlie‚Äôs mom‚Äôs childhood. While some of the side characters are a bit more in the background, I‚Äôve always found the series does a good job of making them all rather dynamic and interesting instead of all just extensions of the main characters.All in all, this is another heartwarming edition to an already endearing series.

Really, so many yummy abs!Apart from the hotness I once again enjoyed the fairytale vibe, I love Stephanie Garber's writing and how she described North with its magic and mysteries. So enchanting! Beautiful writing.But let's get a little bit distracted from men in this book and say a couple of words about women. To be honest, I wish there were more female characters I would want to root for or know more about. Evangeline though was very nice and I found I wasn't annoyed by her inner voice as this book is from her POV and more often than not female characters get on my nerves.Evangeline was an easygoing character whose adventure I enjoyed following along with her.All in all, I can't really empathize how much i want to get my hands on book 3.Time machine? A band of street thieves to steal the draft of the manuscript? Deal with Fae for the next installment in exchange for my firstborn?You name it. I'd agreed to anything if I had the opportunity to read that book now. But I am mentally preparing to suffer for another year.

And I promise to always catch you.""""Happy endings can be caught, but they are difficult to hold on to. They are dreams that want to escape the night. They are treasure with wings.. They are wild, feral, reckless things that need to be constantly chased, or they will certainly run away.""""She used to think love was like a house. Once it was built, a person got to live in it forever. But now she wondered if love was more like a war with new foes constantly appearing and battles creeping up.

I\'d ask other characters to donate braincells to her but the other lot isn\'t much smarter and they definitely don\'t have braincells to spare.all Evangeline cares about is having a love story. and she acts like she\'s having two while in reality she has none.Jacks shouldn\'t touch her because she\'s married to Apollo - a man she has interacted with for two seconds. But at the same time she thinks she can save Jacks by telling him she loves him.girlie, he won\'t care.not only do you have no chemistry with him, thinking""hihi if i just tell him i love him everything will be fine""is dripping with naivety. she truly doesn\'t understand any of the problems and motivations of the other characters. why is she the main one. the perspective of a random tree would have achieved the same thing.TL;DR:they should rebrand this book and target it to toddlers who don\'t have object permanence yet. i think that\'s about the same developmental level Evangeline is at. 1 star.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'HAPPY PUBLICATION DAY, BALLADWhen I first got the email that my owlcrate edition of this book was going to be delivered 3 days early on September 10th, I thought it was a blessing. Not only was it my day off but this book was my most anticipated read of the year!! Then, at 1 am that next morning, it felt more like a curse. Which is actually the theme here so it kind of makes sense.And now, 3 days later, I‚Äôm STILL suffering from such intense heartbreak that I don‚Äôt know if I should rate this book 1 star, or 5 stars (I‚Äôm rating it 5 of course)‚ö†Ô∏èThis review will contain MAJOR spoilers so proceed with caution‚Ä¶‚ö†Ô∏èThis book started right where Once Upon a Broken Heart (which I will be referring to as ouabh from now on) left off. Evangeline is writing a letter to herself, warning her not to trust jacks again. She goes on about even though he‚Äôs cute as fck, it doesn‚Äôt matter. THEN she writes‚ÄùRemember that he was the one to poison Apollo so that he could frame you for murder in order to make a long lost prophecy come true-one that would turn you into a key capable of opening the Valory Arch. That is all he wants, to open the Valory Arch.‚ÄùSo basically, I want to talk about this first because I think it‚Äôs one of the most important parts of Jacks and Evangeline‚Äôs relationship. So since the start, in ouabh and in most of Ballad, Jacks makes it clear that the only reason he keeps saving Evangeline from dying all these different times is because he needs her as the key. He says it, she says it, everyone says it. And it‚Äôs like ok, that makes sense. BUT THEN‚Ä¶When Jacks takes Evangeline to the hollow and she has the youth stone and the youth stone also makes people tell the truth. Jacks doesnÔøΩÔøΩt know she has it and he admits that he doesn‚Äôt even want to open the Valory arch. HE DOESNT EVEN WANT TO OPEN THE VALORY ARCH!!!All he wants are the four stones needed to open if which he didn‚Äôt even need Evangeline to help him find them. Which leads me to my next point. Jacks cursed Apollo. And I know it doesn‚Äôt really make sense as to why he would have cursed him if he doesn‚Äôt even want to open the arch, but I think he new Apollo is a bad person and will hurt Evangeline. (Because Apollo steals all of her memories at the end of the book and makes her forget everything, I will get to that later). But I don‚Äôt really know if that would make sense because the cure for Apollos curse is In the Valory Arch.It‚Äôs all so confusing to me and all my emotions are so conflicted but I think it‚Äôs very important that Jacks was actually keeping Evangeline alive all those times because he LOVES HER. DUH.ONTO MY FAVORITE EVAJACKS MOMENTSIn ouabh we had like minor angst and then the crypt scene phew. But I had to put Ballad down multiple times just to process the tension oh my god. So many butterflies for them üò≠This part of the book was literally life changing for me‚ÄùEvangeline‚Äî‚Äú Jacks‚Äôs low voice sounded distant, but he must have been there because she could feel him. She could feel the cool of his arms siding gently under her legs and carefully under her neck as he cradled her to his chest.‚ÄúIt hurts, jacks.‚Äù‚ÄúI know, love. I‚Äôm going to take you somewhere safe.‚ÄùOh my god, he literally just called her LOVE ??? I literally died and came back to lifeAnd then there‚Äôs just the entire part where they‚Äôre at the hollow together, I wish I could put that entire section in this review because it‚Äôs fucking everything.Also this part.‚ÄùI mean‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just for one night,‚Äù he said softly. ‚ÄúIn the morning, you can forget it. You can go back to pretending you don‚Äôt like me, and I can pretend that I don‚Äôt care. But for tonight, let me pretend you‚Äôre mine.‚ÄùKeep in mind, JACKS said that to Evangeline. üò≠üò≠üò≠Now‚Ä¶As I drew near the end of the book, I could feel my grip on this happily ever slipping. I will literally start crying as I describe how saddened I was by this ending. After Jacks uses the four stones to go back in time and save Evangeline from chaos, it is then IMPLIED that he sacrifices himself in her place. I feel like this could definitely be and opening for a third book because I just feel like after everything Jacks has been through, and how much is readers love him. He death cannot be so‚Ä¶ not there.Also there was never a body soooo‚Ä¶.But the very end, like the last chapter and then the EPILOGUE. Ruined me. Literally fuck Apollo, I fucking hate him. Which is another reason I think there could be a third book, because what the fuck??? Since when can Apollo just fucking pull memories out of peoples heads?? There has to be some explaining there. And also if left in such a cliff hanger??But also part of me thinks, this is just a tragedy, and maybe it is. Because my heart is most definitely broken and maybe it just has to stay that way.I shall finish off my rant here, I should probably talk a little about the story and writing now.As always, I love Stephanie Garbers writing. It is TRULY magical. I devoured this book all in one sitting and it‚Äôs a world I most definitely would love to visit.The story itself was nothing too complicated, I loved the story of the archer and the fox and how it ties in. I loved Lucs character. His and Evangeline‚Äôs relationship is just proof that exes can have healthy friendships after. Even if one of them is a vampire üòèI will probably come back and edit this review at some point, or maybe not.

You can go back to pretending you don\'t like me, and I can pretend that I don\'t care. But for tonight, let me pretend you\'re mine.‚ÄùAll I feel is pain.So yeah. I\'m not okay right now. I knew the ending would kill me based off of reviews and people literally telling me that they cried and yes:I cried.But we\'ll have the ending\'s own section at the end, so let\'s first talk about...THE PLOTAlso, huge thank you tojoy (elend\'s version)for giving me a summary on the first book! If you hadn\'t, I wouldn\'t have remembered anything!Oh. My God. So, if you all were seeing some of my status updates popping up (and there were a lot of them) then you know that I was freaking out literally all of the way through. Miss Garber was feeding us those plot twists. I was squealing, gasping, screaming, and giggling after almost each chapter because HOLY PLOT TWISTS. There was literally never a dull moment in this book, it was either really tense or funny, and I L O V E D it.I literally predicted none of the plot twists except maybe one:Jacks was the Archer. It seemed really obvious that Jacks was the Archer to meI love a good book that just keeps bringing in the plot twists. I was reading out in public and I literally had to resist gawking at the book and looking like an idiot because a twist was just revealed.Anyways, this plot was amazing, incredible, splendid, magical, and a bunch of other words alike to those.AND THEN WE HAVE...THE CHARACTERSI want to be like Evangeline Fox. I love her so much. So, in the beginning when I was getting used to the characters again, I didn\'t like her at first (probably because I wanted Jacks all to myself but we don\'t talk about my unhealthy attachment to fictional characters okay-) but she is an amazing protagonist. She actually makes semi-rational decisions, but she also was apparently really dumb according to my updates where I said she was dumb like twice. So yes, she did some stupid things in this book, but everyone does, so I can\'t fault her. But oh my gosh, this girl has been THROUGH IT. So much stuff happens to her in this book and I feel so bad!‚ÄúI wish our story could have had another ending.‚ÄùStop.Anyways, onto Jacks. My one true love. I know, he\'s manipulative, cruel, only cares about himself, but do I care?No.Jacks could turn me into one of those vampires any day, I don\'t care. Sure, he makes ahem *questionable* choices throughout this book, but they were all because he cared about Evangeline. Maybe. At least I HOPE so. Jacks better not be pulling an ""I didn\'t actually care for you"" thing. I will die if he does.Here are some gems from the Prince of Hearts\'s mouth:‚ÄúIt\'s all right. I\'d probably kill another man if I found him with you like this.‚ÄùI\'m not okay.‚ÄúWhere were you?‚Äù she asked.‚ÄúI was killing innocent maidens and kicking puppies.‚Äù‚ÄúJacks, that‚Äôs not funny.‚ÄùComedic legend.‚ÄúI do not want you dead, and I‚Äôll kill anyone who tries.‚ÄùWe love an overprotective prince.So, if you can\'t tell already, I\'ve got an unhealthy obsession. And to be quite honest?I like him more than Legend.YES, I SAID IT.10/10‚ÄúDark was for stars and dreams and the magic that took place in between days.‚ÄùAll of these side characters were great too:-We learn so much about LaLa and that she\'s no ordinary Fate. I was actually shocked when her plot twists came in.-Chaos is a great villain. I was genuinely awed and horrified by his actions and all of these things he did to Evangeline were awful.-Apollo can fall off a cliff-Why does Luc just keep randomly appearing just to try to bite Evangeline?If there are any other side characters that I\'ve forgotten, that must mean they aren\'t important.AND THAT FINALLY BRINGS US TO...EVAJACKS/THEIR IMPECCABLE TENSIONOh my gosh. Practically all of their scenes were FULL of tension and it was literally eating me from the inside out. Miss Garber definitely knows how to write tension. There were SO many different scenes where I thought they were going to kiss, and they made me absolutely insane. I was giggling an embarrassing amount IN PUBLIC. But yeah, Evangeline and Jacks turn me into an absolute monster and I\'m okay with that.‚ÄúIt hurts, Jacks.‚Äù‚ÄúI know, love. I‚Äôm going to take you somewhere safe.‚ÄùExcuse me-AND THEY DON\'T EVEN KISS IN THIS BOOK. WHY DID THE KISS SCENE HAVE TO BE BETWEEN APOLLO AND EVANGELINE, THAT KISS WAS HOT. JUST PUT JACKS IN THE PLACE OF APOLLO*sigh* and then there\'s...the ending.Why. Just why. WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE THIS?? I HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG AND THEN YOU GIVE METHIS??When I read the final few chapters, my jaw was open, my eyes were watering, and I kept whispering, ""oh my god"" and ""no"" over and over. And then when it was all over and I\'d read the epilogue, I just stared at the wall, tears running down my face, and then silently marked this as read.THANK GOD THERE\'S A THIRD BOOK COMING BECAUSE WTF.Literally so much was going on with this ending, and I will never forget it.To all the people who warned me that I would cry, you were correct.‚ÄúShe wanted the pain to end. She wanted to forget his dimpled smile, his brilliant blue eyes, the way he called her Little Fox.‚ÄùSo yeah, this was my review of The Ballad of Never After. I\'ve not felt this strongly over a book in a while, so this was fun. So, um, excuse me while I just go and stare at the wall for another hour.

The development in the storyline from there to here was sosignificantand the plot twists left me absolutely intrigued and hooked and I completelydevoured this.You can definitely expect more curses, more chaos, more Lala, newish characters, general character build up, and twists and turns in this.Evangeline and Jacks ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù evolved immeasurably here. I loved the progression in the emotional buildup and was LIVING for the fun banter/tension between them and the steamy crumbs we did get were painfully delicious.

They were both dark stalker(ish) romances with kinky smut. This book is shit though, sorry.‚û• Adeline (h)was so beyond annoying. She\'s so fucking dumb, I\'m so tired of women being written like this. Like I\'m genuinely personally offended that I have to associate with her because never do I meet women who are like this in real life. And by that I mean, these women that act like children, that don\'t have a single logical, mature cell in their body. It\'s insulting and we need to start writing female main characters with some respect. This girl was clueless, pathetic and honestly, just overall shallow. I have a similar opinion about Rae, the fmc inHer Soul to Take, but imo, Adeline was even worse.‚û• Zane (H)...ew *pukes*. I feel like I\'m missing out on some big prank, people like this guy? He\'s so pathetic, god. This fucker thinks he\'s so tough (he literally like...says self-affirmations about himself in his inner monologue), he strokes his ego by killing sex traffickers and makes that his hobby, his little quirk. He goes on and on about how those men should burn in hell for what they\'ve done yet here he iscasually and remorselessly stalking and raping a girl in his free time.Even if we put that aside, and just focus on shit like his dirty talk or dick skills (he has none), he\'s gross and incompetent. As shown by the featured quote above,thisis what we are dealing with. Nothing that came out of his mouth was swoony, hot or sexy to me.I\'m going to start out with this because I feel like otherwise it\'ll get lost in the end of my review and no one will care but can we please stop making sapphic relationships a joke?""It seems every day, my appreciation for Daya grows. She gave me a sense of safety I didn‚Äôt realize I was missing. I‚Äôm going to have to propose to her soon or something.""This is the fmc talking about her relationship with her best friend. Um, can we not? üò≠ It\'s so easy to justnotwrite shit like this, invalidating sapphic relationships. I don\'t careee if it\'s just a joke or whatever, pick something else to joke about or find another way to show your appreciation for your friend, but stop treating sapphic relationships like jokes.I\'ve always defended writing in the contemporary romance genre because it doesn\'t need to be flowery and classy, in fact, it\'s annoying when it is.But I\'ve probably never read a book with worse writing than this.Look at this bitch\'s inner monologue.I need the Tin Man to oil the hinges on my door just as much as I need the Lion\'s bravery. I\'m shaking like a leaf.Really?? A wizard of oz reference?? What even is this, it doesn\'t take a genius to understand that writing like this is not adequate for a book that is meant to have a dark tone to it. It ruins the atmosphere and necessary formality that is vital to the reader taking this book seriously.I stare at the flower like it\'s a live tarantula, staring straight back at me and daring me to come closer. If I do, it\'ll surely eat me alive.""Girl, it is aflower. I\'m sick,sickof these shitty metaphors. Not everyone is cut out to be a writer - but especially not an author who writes like this.I\'m scared, but I\'m also stupid. So, I\'m not leaving.Her self-awareness doesn\'t make me like her more. Why is it necessary to have a clueless, idiot as the fmc, eugh.Gives me the heebie jeebies.This is apublished book.Have we not evolved past this type of colloquial writing? It\'s just awful and genuinely takes away from the atmosphere the author should be trying to create in these types of books.Maybe I\'ll eat some Cheerios. They say those are good for the heart right?To top it off we get modern references too. I don\'t like when authors insert modern world references into their writing. No one wants to read about Cheerios when they\'re reading a dark smutty romance.She\'s so prim and proper, and I\'m so...not. Where she holds herself with regality and grace, I have a terrible habit of slumping and sitting with my legs open.Omg, she\'s not like other girls!!! And to think that I thought I couldn\'t possibly hate this fmc more and she pulls the \'i\'m not like other girls\' line.Chunks of concrete fly into my eyes as more bullets ping around me. I grunt, rubbing at my lids to clear my visionThis is from the male perspective. Other than the fact that this whole sentence was unnecessary, if concrete flew into your eyes, you know damn well you\'d fall to the ground like a bug. These details are not only inaccurate but also beyond unnecessary. Even fantasy authors do research so they know how long it takes to die out from blood loss but you aren\'t even aware that CHUNKS OF CONCRETE can\'t fly into your eyes without you becoming immobilized from pain? Have you never had anything get stuck in your eye? Jesus.""As much as I hate to say this to you, I am no stranger to a woman\'s pussy and what it feels like when it weeps for me.""Point and laugh, everyone. If you think this is top-tier dirty talk...oml. Moreover, this is while he isforcing himself onto herand she is turned on and he basically takes that as an invitation to do whatever the fuck he wants. I\'m not someone who\'s picky with consentin books, I\'m cool with a dub-con situation, but the logic in this book is just not logicing. Many sexual assault survivors deal with guilt about their assault because they were turned on during the process. Arousal is not an okay, many people get aroused when their body hears etc. anything inherently sexual. The fmc\'s inner monologue also didn\'t help because she never said that she wanted it but that she wouldn\'t admit it and blah blah. She begged him to stop, talked about how it hurt, and he left her crying in a ball after he fucked her.Maybe this is just me, but I like fictional men because they treat their girls right. Leon is a great example of ""I hate everyone but you"", but this dude is just hatingherand treating her like absolute garbage. Me personally, I don\'t find that so cute. Maybe it\'s just me though, idk...So, this guy basically rapes her a shit ton of times,which is ironic bc this guy is always swimming in his saviour complex. He supposedly rescues women and children from sex trafficking rings. Which like...nice ig? I just feel like that was just a plot device for him to be likeable.Because he shows no kindness, no tenderness and no charmingness, in any way shape or form, I supposethe reader has to rely on a fact that establishes his supposed morality to find him the least bit likable.This is also used as an excuse to write more and more internal monologue about how he can\'t imagineeee what it\'s like to go through whatever blah blah andhe\'s always trying to be cool and slick while confronting the sex traffickers as if this is just some adrenaline rush to him.He\'s just sohypocriticaltalking about how any guy that forces himself onto women/children deserves to go to hell and be tortured (Which is his hobby. He like...likes to torture people...idk that\'s lame to me. It\'s like when guys flex about punching shit when they\'re mad). Meanwhile, here he is, going into this girl\'s house, forcing himself onto her, justifying it because of the girl being turned on, and then leaving her there lying on the floor curled into herself and crying. Feelingviolated.He even saysI\'m going to make her fall in love with every single fucked up part of me.And...I think what I find so unappealing about this male character is that you don\'t see him trying to win over the fmc. He just has an ego where he decides shewilldo what he wants because he\'s powerful enough to get it and so it shall be. And that\'s...boring to me. Again, I\'m no wimp when it comes to dark romance, but this is just so boring. Not only is this book horribly, unnecessarily long, but it\'s also boring because, who wants to watch a man rape a woman in her house 3 different ways for 800 pages straight? I mean, personally, not me.Anyway, let\'s talk about how bad the smut was because I think that\'s what made it the saddest for me lmao. So let\'s refresh, the writing was bad, the characters were bad, the plot was bad...but there was still potential in the sex section. Yet, I was disappointed once again. I\'ve already established that it was rapey (it\'s in the TWs but it doesn\'t really make it any better imo). Not so cute. But even the ideas themselves were lame. The first time Zane fucks Adeline, it\'s with a gun. Now, this is meant to be all quirky and kinky but it was written terribly imo. The dirty talk revolving the idea wasn\'t good and the actual description ignited nothing within me.If youdowant to read a good gun sex scene, you should look intoHer Soul for Revenge. Not only is it incredibly hot, well drawn out, with great dialogue and variety, but it also has a fantastic character dynamic. The fmc in that book is so much more badass, so the playing field is even and so much more fun. Both characters take part in the teasing and dirty talk and ugh, let me tell you, it was years better than the sex scene in this one.There was another sex scene that involved Zane ""catching"" or ""chasing"" Adeline, which seemed fun, I was totally down. But again, imo it was badly executed and was much better done by Harley Laroux\'s soul series. Unfortunately, I don\'t quite remember which book, I think (think) it wasHer Soul for Revengeif I\'m not mistaken. They also had a sort of \'i catch and chase you and fuck you\' scene but it was outside in the woods, much longer and much hotter. Another aspect that I think made it better in Harley Laroux\'s was that there was explicit consent given beforehand, and a safe-word if necessary. So, it was more playful and fun and even more personal, which made the chemistry much more believable. The aftercare was also beautifully, tenderly done, which is what we want!! The men taking care of and admiring their women, while also feeding into his and her fantasies :)So, on top of complaining about thequalityof the smut, I\'m also here to complain about thequantity. So again, this book has no romantic aspect, thin plot and bad characters, so people read it for the smut.Yet, I had to wait until around40%to read the first sex scene!!!BOOOOOO üçÖüçÖüçÖ. And when we finally get to the smut, this is what we get:""You\'re so fucking creamy,"" he rasps.Is this supposed to have me screamin and creamin or? Anyway...The mystery aspect was so fucking dull. I do not understand how people cared about the little diary entries and her dead grandma at all. I read spoiler reviews of who the killer was and I\'m really not that surprised but I also justdid not care.Lastly, Ididdnf this book, and I guess it is possible for it to get better (i think i heard the second book is better) but I\'m really not interested in giving this book another chance. And that\'s ignoring the fact that this book isso unnecessarily long.Once again,no one does it like Harley Laroux.I can\'t wait for her to release the third book of the trilogy aaa!!‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ ‚ô° ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'This book was fucking corny. It was awful, but also a fucking cornfest. When reading a ‚Äúdark‚Äù romance, you expect a little more depth and triggering themes to accompany the story. Maybe a little drugs, death, etc. This book combines a goofy ass hacker vigilante stalker, and an insufferable heroine, and claims itself to be a dark romance. It‚Äôs a joke. The main character Adeline is supposedly the ‚Äúmanipulator‚Äù and Z or the stalker is the ‚Äúshadow?‚Äù I don‚Äôt rlly fucking remember the names because it was so stupid and unnecessary. Anyways, the story proceeds with Addie staying at this creepy fucking house for no fucking reason where countless people have died, introduces a whole ass fuckinf ghost, and then promptly forgets that part of the plot. Like okay cool beans ig. Then Z sees her jn some book signing and stalks her like insanely. Okay Z is the corniest mf I‚Äôve ever read in my life. He‚Äôs this dub-con, psycho (he literally sends her a pair of cut off hands when she lets some creep finger bang her) stalker who is actually a self taught mastermind hacker who saves kids and women from sex trafficking. Yep. I‚Äôm serious. It‚Äôs an absolute cringe fest. Her bff is also a ‚Äúvigilante.‚Äù The word choice the author uses is so juvenile it made me scream. I mean do we live in a Neil Breene movie? The ‚Äúdarkness‚Äù this book promises is completely gone at this point. The funniest and most ironic part however, is that Mr. Savior, aka mr. I-cant-bear-to-see-innocent-kids-raped-at-the-hands-of-powerful-men-and-I-have-to-save-them-with-my-chiseled-jaw-and-ugly-scar, RAPES THE MAIN CHARACTER WITH A GUN. I mean are you kidding me? I don‚Äôt mind dub con, but Atleast take a look at the damn plot author. YOU CANT HAVE HIM SAVE RAPE SURVIVORS AND THEN RAPE TNE MAIN CHARACTER?! The later sex scenes are a little better because she‚Äôs more ‚Äúattracted‚Äù to him and apparently gets off on the fear like okay whatever woman. He even tells her to get off his dick and start running because she loves the chase. Like she‚Äôs on his dick and then gets off its so fucking funny like a damn Jack in the box. Anyways, back to the child trafficking sacrifices drinking blood scenes. These scenes are so corny, I mean there‚Äôs these senators who are doing it and Z and his group are trying to hack into their society which hey? Wanna know the name of theyre creepy dangerous group? THE SOCIETY?! Like hello?! Is this wattpad novel? It‚Äôs so funny. Anyways these scenes were the only thing keeping me reading this book. One reason was because it was so corny it was funny, and the other was because it was actually interesting seeing how fuckimg lame someone can make sex trafficking. I mean come on. Also apparently Addies great grandma also had a stalker and was supposedly killed by her husband? And Addie was targeted by the society to be sold because she‚Äôs pretty? It‚Äôs all so much and so poorly executed.Okay this book has several major flaws. But the biggest one is trying to have too many storylines at once. You have the romance and sex, the stalker and fear, the sex trafficking, and the grandmas murder. It‚Äôs wayyy to much. Pair that with a drawn out plot, juvenile writing, corny ass scenes, and insufferable characters. That my friend, creates a bad book.

That is SO harmful and is a recipe for disaster. Don\'t even get me started on the themes of consensual-non-consensual sex in this book.

",Gabrielle Zevin,4.14,1083674,6196,"Fiction, Contemporary, Romance, Audiobook, Literary Fiction, Adult, Historical Fiction",401,05-07-2022,"In this exhilarating novel, two friends‚Äîoften in love, but never lovers‚Äîcome together as creative partners in the world of video game design, where success brings them fame, joy, tragedy, duplicity, and, ultimately, a kind of immortality.On a bitter-cold day, in the December of his junior year at Harvard, Sam Masur exits a subway car and sees, amid the hordes of people waiting on the platform, Sadie Green. He calls her name. For a moment, she pretends she hasn't heard him, but then, she turns, and a game begins: a legendary collaboration that will launch them to stardom. These friends, intimates since childhood, borrow money, beg favors, and, before even graduating college, they have created their first blockbuster,Ichigo. Overnight, the world is theirs. Not even twenty-five years old, Sam and Sadie are brilliant, successful, and rich, but these qualities won't protect them from their own creative ambitions or the betrayals of their hearts.Spanning thirty years, from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Venice Beach, California, and lands in between and far beyond, Gabrielle Zevin'sTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrowis a dazzling and intricately imagined novel that examines the multifarious nature of identity, disability, failure, the redemptive possibilities in play, and above all, our need to connect: to be loved and to love. Yes, it is a love story, but it is not one you have read before.","[{'rating': 4, 'content': 'This is one of those well-lauded books that I felt a bit hesitant going in. I assumed it was targeted for a certain audience‚Äîeither those who gravitate towards stories about complicated friendships, or gamers. I\'m not sure either of those are me, so what would I get out of it?And when I first started, I thought for sure I\'d made a mistake. The first chapter was so overwritten, coming across as both pretentious and off-putting, and I cringed my way through it. I thought to myself, this is it. The book that everyone loves, I\'d either have to give up on or end up writing a lowly-rated review and be subjected to comments about brain deficiency.I took a break and then decided to give it another chance. Chapter 2 was a little bit better. And then we come to Chapter 3, and bam! I was hooked. It\'s not an understatement to say that the scene with Dov teaching the Advanced Games seminar class was my favorite of the whole book and it\'s what sold me on reading it.From then on, every moment related to designing or making video games, I was totally there for. Before I started, if you\'d told me that that would be the part I\'d enjoy the most, I would\'ve been surprised. I wouldn\'t categorize myself as a gamer since I\'ve probably only loved one video game my whole life. (That wasAnimal Crossing, first on the GameCube and then almost 20 years later asAnimal Crossing: New Horizonson the Switch.)But then when I think about it, I shouldn\'t have been surprised. The way this book talks about games, they\'re really presented as more like stories, albeit ones where the reader can participate in and influence the direction and outcome. And I\'m certainly a reader of the most passionate sort.I\'m also a software engineer with a little bit of experience making video games on the side, so of course the technical aspects of Sam and Sadie\'s ventures totally appealed to me. Reading about their projects is more or less like reading about work‚Äîwhich I normally avoid like the plague‚Äîbut somehow this book made it exciting.I can\'t help but wish the games were real. I want to play them and capture the feelings reading about them evoked in me. And I also want to know everything that went into making them. If this were a biography on a real video game company, I would\'ve loved it from cover to cover and completely gobbled it up.But it wasn\'t, and as a result, this wasn\'t a perfect story for me. It very much centers around Sam and Sadie\'s friendship, and that was pretty much the weakest part. I didn\'t really connect with either of the characters. All their issues were the result of the dreaded miscommunication trope, where one or the other refuses to say what they mean, leading to misunderstandings. And this went on and on, through many years.My other issue with the story is that it includes a certain development that comes out of nowhere, seemingly for no other reason than to beat down the characters, thus eliciting tugs of the heartstrings and upping the emotional ante. And I\'m just not a fan. It doesn\'t add anything to the story and it left me feeling somewhat emotionally manipulated.I also have to point out that the story at times feels like it\'s a bit too clever with its verbiage. Like at one point, this book conjured up the only two literary characters who know what ""jejune"" means and put them in a conversation with each other. While that\'s an impressive use of the thesaurus, it detracts a bit from the story being told.But I don\'t think my experience with the book is typical. A lot of other readers praise the depiction of Sam and Sadie\'s relationship and declare their love for the book despite the video game segments. I\'m pretty much the complete opposite. But even coming from two different directions, it seems we have all reached the same conclusion, and that\'s our collective enjoyment for this supremely interesting story. And in the end, that\'s all that really matters.~~~~~~~~~~~~‚úßConnect with me‚úßInstagram‚úßThis was a pick for my Book of the Month box. Get your first book for $5here.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'This book is so utterly pretentiousness and trying so hard to be woke that I should have given up on it instead of seeing it to the end. I would have if the beginning hadn‚Äôt been so beautifully done. There‚Äôs a line in the book about a video game sequel being awful because it was farmed out to Indian programmers who had no interest in the game and that‚Äôs how this book feels after the incredible start. The beginning was layered, nuanced and artfully done. I hate flashbacks but this book had managed to layer the present, past and future in such an incredible way before it fell off a cliff and suddenly feels like an entirely different writer took over.The story began with Sadie and Sam central to the story. We found out about them in a narrative that skipped around in time to let us understand them and their relationship. Sam was the obviously the more sympathetic of the two and the one you as a reader care about. Sadie was often annoying and then fell apart in a ridiculous way. I hoped her awful college self with the horrible college boyfriend would evolve and grow up but she never does. Even worse for the story is the tangents that from that point became the story. We suddenly get a new character who is rightly called boring later on. He is a NPC. He‚Äôs just too good and uninteresting to take up so much space. We get his backstory we don‚Äôt need. In a similar way later on we get two new characters that happen to be gay that bring nothing to the story other than a celebration of their sexuality which apparently is worth their inclusion. Much like tangents about their game that take up unnecessary page time and continue to dilute any attempt at storytelling. There‚Äôs plenty of politics, even to a ridiculously degree like actual comical bad guys intent on violence against those in favor of gay relationships and marriage. Ironically for a book full of wokeness with characters never being straight, celebrating gender fluidity, the book managed to ridicule cultural appropriation. The book is very focused on the race of the characters but never explores them in more than a superficial way.One of the author‚Äôs worst faults was her pretentious word choices. Instead of writing in way that flowed she chose to constantly check her thesaurus for jarring words like jejune and verdigris every couple of pages. Ironically much like the criticism of a game her character created this book is pretentious and full of itself. The worst part is that could have been amazing if it had stayed as focused as it was in the beginning. This is not a story worth the journey so do not push play. I received a complimentary copy of this book. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow I will still be thinking about this brilliant book.Fair warning that I am predisposed to adore coming-of-age novels about protagonists of my generation (Gen X), apparently even if I don‚Äôt have much in common with them other than birth year. In this case, the protagonists are Sadie and Sam, two friends whose lives intertwine up, down, and around their love of gaming.It must be said that this book is VERY MUCH about video games. Sadie and Sam play them, talk about them, design them, and promote them over the span of thirty years. What a testament to author Gabrielle Zevin‚Äôs writing that I could be glued to the pages of a story about a topic that typically bores me to tears! Because I loved Sadie and Sam so much, I never lost interest in their worlds - either the real one of their day-to-day existence or the virtual ones they were building.They are, without a doubt in my mind, the two characters I‚Äôve cared about the most over the past decade of my reading life.I do say that with a bit of trepidation, as I know some readers of this review who love me (shout out to my mom again!) will want to read Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow to meet my new literary best friends. I must therefore point out that while the novel is a masterpiece in my eyes, some people are not going to be able to get through it. Zevin is a fan of obscure words, there are risky techniques used (such as an occasional second-person chapter and dropping readers into a video game world), sad and unsavory things happen in the plot, and the text is fairly dense. This is a long 416 pages.Also, having read (and enjoyed) Zevin‚Äôs previous two novels, The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry and Young Jane Young, this feels like it‚Äôs from an entirely different author. I breezed through those others in a day, but Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow took me a week. I know that‚Äôs because I savored every word and often reread entire paragraphs, but that‚Äôs my point. If her prior books were hamburgers, this one is a steak.I feel a bit bad for the upcoming books I‚Äôll be reading in the wake of this novel, since I know nothing will compare for a very long time. In case it‚Äôs not clear enough already, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow has a well-earned place on my all-time favorites shelf. When you finish the final page of a book and hug it to your chest, where else would it go?My sincere thanks to the author and Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group for the gifted review copy via NetGalley. Now available.Blog:https://www.confettibookshelf.com/'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""***5 Stars***This was one of those books where, when someone asks you what the book you are reading is about, you are kind of at a loss for words. Because, as the blurb stated, this was essentially a book about two good friends making a video game together.But was it?Not gonna lie, I wasn't sure where I would land on this when I decided to pick up late via BOTM add-on. (See, I even skipped over it when it was one of the monthly picks).Despite being a child of the 80's and 90's, I never played videogames. I know, I know...the horror, some of you might be thinking. But, whelp, my dad was adamantly against us playing them, convinced it would make us lazy and turn our minds into mush.Well, while I can't say that I'mnotlazy or that my mindisn'tmush despite never being a gamer, Icansay that, based on the one or two times I played it at a friends' house, Ireallysucked atMario Kartanyway.But I digress.Like I said, never having been a gamer, I was worried about how that might play into my enjoyment of a book which, on the surface, was centered around video games.But again...was it really?Yes and no.This was about so much more than video games, folks. So much more than standard friendship. I can't even explain what I mean here...It just encapsulated so much of the human experience in such a bold, yet nuanced way.In today's western culture--which is seemingly insistent uponeverythinghaving to be a social justice/political statement that slams you over the head on exhausting repeat--the way this book handled said topics felt...organic.Showing not telling.Allowing me toabsorbthe message instead of simply beating me over the head with self-righteousness.So refreshing.Also, there are so many elements of the book that felt personal to me...that struck a chord with me. I won't get into them; but, suffice to say that, again, this book was very much about the human experience. And the way the author used video games as a platform for it all was super creative. And super well executed, in my opinion.Originally, I rated this 4.5 instead of 5 stars; however, I've thought about this book a lot since finishing it several days ago. And anything that makes me self-reflect...that moves me enough to contemplate the facets of it days later...deserves the full five.P.S. You don't need to be a gamer to love this book.P.P.S. You do need to love Marx.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Complicated and MemorableTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow,is a multilayered novel about friendship, love, and video games.Sam and Sadie met when they are kids and quickly bonded over their love of video games. They develop a friendship that spans almost 30 years. The novel follows the highs and lows of their friendship, including falling in love, falling out, a love triangle, successes, and failures. Throughout it all, the one constant in their lives is video games.The narrative alternates primarily between Sadie and Sam's POVs.Sam and Sadie are both loveable, arrogant, infuriating, and flawed.The dynamics of their friendship are complicated by love, jealousy, and misunderstanding. I got a little sick of the friends to frenemies cycle between Sadie and Sam (more of Sadie‚Äôs anger towards Sam, but I understood her point of view).I loved them, but I also wanted to shake some sense in them.Sam‚Äôs mother, Anna; Marx, Sam‚Äôs college roommate; Dov, Sadie's professor; are some additional characters who make an impact.My favorite characters were Sam‚Äôs grandparents, Dong Hyun and Bong Cha.The novel blends reality and game worlds, and parts of the narrative take place in a virtual open world.All characters are well-developed and multidimensional. Even the avatars are multidimensional.I am not a huge fan of video games, but this book made me nostalgic for the video games of my childhood.I got all of the Oregon Trail and Mario references, but there were times that I was a little lost, but I didn‚Äôt mind because I learned so much about gaming.The reader doesn‚Äôt need to know much about video games to enjoy this book (but it might help!).There are also a lot of 80s, 90s, and early 2000s pop culture references mixed in. I loved reading the details behind creating a game and the gaming industry as I was introduced to a whole new world.This is a well-written, complex, thought-provoking, and original novel. I was invested in the characters, and some moments hit me on an emotional level. I got teary-eyed towards the end. I won't forget these characters; this is a book that is going to stay with me for a long time.I received an ARC of this book from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I feel... really disappointed by this. I\'ve loved Zevin\'s books in the past and I was lured in by some of the early starred reviews that promised I would be enchanted by this book. I can see the many interesting themes the author is juggling here and have highlighted a few passages I thought were noteworthy, yet a few moments of brilliance just couldn\'t make this book any less tedious for me.The story is essentially about gamers and video games, throwing up constant references to the history of gaming and gaming culture. The two main characters, Sadie and Sam, bond over playing video games when the pair meet in the children\'s ward of a hospital and later conceive of, and program, games of their own. Their own personal stories-- involving family, friends, sexism in the industry and abusive relationships (contains emotional manipulation and sexual assault) play out alongside this.I will confess that maybe it is just my disinterest in the world of gaming that drives my apathy towards this story. I have played my fair share of certain games-- caught them all in Pokemon, explored the worlds of Final Fantasy VII onwards, built a fabulous neighbourhood in Sims, employed some questionable antics in Grand Theft Auto and, to a lesser extent, tried my hand at Tomb Raider, Resident Evil and The Last of Us.That being said, I do not consider ""gamer"" to be a defining term for me. I would always rather read. And my interest in games does not extend beyond the games to the culture surrounding it.Kirkus assured me that even those who ""have never played a video game in their lives"" will love this book, but I feel like that probably isn\'t true. I found it a struggle just to make it through and I kept finding excuses to check my email, google something random that occurred to me, or just do household chores instead of reading this.Some people have commented on it being a long book, but 400 pages isn\'t all that long. It feels much longer.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Obviously, I'm in the minority here, but I wasn't particularly enthralled.A lack of concentration plagues Tomorrow, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, a novel I found to be lacking. The narrative jumps from the present to various points in the past without providing the reader with an opportunity to get emotionally invested in any of the protagonists, except maybe Marx.In general, the overall writing was pleasant. Particularly interesting to me was the genuineness of the content concerning game design and production.Unfortunately, as someone who has spent a large portion of their adult life working in the gaming industry, I found the protagonists' talks of game design and development outside the scope of their debut game Ichigo to be tedious.The story was dull and I found the author's constant urge to stay\xa0woke\xa0to be obnoxious. While I respect her intention to raise awareness about pressing social concerns, I found that her preachiness frequently derailed the narrative and detracted from the plot. I find it fascinating when authors of fiction skillfully weave explorations of societal concerns into the fabric of their narratives. Unfortunately, in my opinion, Zenin did not carry out this action.Finally, while the first half of the book is interesting and well written, the second half falls apart under the weight of its own ambitions.Should you still read it? Probably based on all the other reviews.Rating: 3Follow me on Instagram!""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""My thoughts before finding out about Zevin's plagiarism and Zionism: I understand the hype. The book is well-written with a lot of heart. From the moment the characters meet in chapter 2, I loved their friendship. I especially enjoyed seeing their creative process in making video games and the level of thought put into storytelling and quality of work. This is something that would appeal to any creative person, regardless if you're a video game designer or not. I was not a fan of certain romantic developments, since they were unnecessary and felt like an easy way to create drama, but still very solid overall.My thoughts now: I'm disappointed that Zevin didn't give credit to Brenda Romero's undistributed game, 'Train,' when she gave credit to plenty of other game creators in her acknowledgements. It wouldn't have been difficult to simply add another name, and crediting wouldn't have detracted from the story either. It's sadly ironic that for a story about women being underrepresented and overlooked in the gaming industry, the author would do the same to Romero. Doubly disappointing is Zevin's ties to Hadassah, a US-based Zionist women's organization. I'd hoped that the mention of Israel in the book was because Zevin wanted to add more flaws to her antagonist character, but it appears that she shares the same beliefs.

Zevin\'s descriptions of the process, so technical, transport the reader into an imaginary world so vast that at one point, i saw myself in the game sam and sadie made. additionally, i salute the author\'s courage to include difficult literary techniques (e.g.: second-person pov) in an already intricate setting.ultimately, the brilliance of this book comes from its characters. i don\'t think i have cared for characters this deeply sinceAlone With You in the Ether. sam, sadie, and marx are written with depth and empathy. they evolve like real people would, for better and worse. their humanity shines through the tragedies, pulling me into their suffering: that\'s how i know that characterization can only go so far. this is what differentiates unpleasantly brilliant books from mediocre but entertaining ones.and god, the intimacy between the three characters. there is something about the chemistry, the interactions, and their thoughts that made me wonder: can love can be greater than this?in the end, i know that this book is absolutely not for everyone, and not everyone who loved and hated this will feel the same emotions throughout the experience. for now, i leave this book at 4.5 (it will change eventually) butTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrowwill stay in my mind and my heart for a long time.--------------------------pre-review:this book induces in me such profound grief, that i am feeling physically unwell.rtc once i recover'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'So I found this book very entertaining and easy to read and also disappointing at times too. Starting with what I enjoyed about the book, I found the prose so readable. Gabrielle Zevin has a knack for telling a good story and about 100 pages in, I felt immersed in her characters‚Äô lives in a way that only some of the best writers can execute. There‚Äôs a slice-of-life quality to the storytelling inTomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrowthat helped me feel like I was gliding along with Sam, Sadie, and Marx‚Äôs lives from their college years to their early and then approaching mid-adulthood. The video game aspect of the story actually made sense to me and added a quirky touch to the novel that didn‚Äôt come across as gimmicky.I also liked the integration of social commentary in this book through the characters‚Äô lives. I felt a lot for Sam and his struggle with his disability and Sadie with her experiences of sexism in the video game industry and in life generally. Zevin does a nice job of showing and not telling so that these elements of social justice/injustice felt organic instead of too obvious or preachy.I think my biggest critique of this book centers on Sam and Sadie‚Äôs friendship. I will couch this commentary by saying that I read a lot of literary fiction and it‚Äôs one of my favorite genres so my expectations are reasonably high. I found their friendship engaging, though at the same time I don‚Äôt think Zevin developed the foundation of their friendship enough to merit all of the conflict and turmoil they experienced. For example, Sam consistently idealizes Sadie throughout the book and is all ‚ÄúI love Sadie Green even though I can‚Äôt tell her‚Äù and I was like uh why?? Like I get that they had a somewhat intense bonding experience as kids and then they made video games together, but I literally had no clue why Sam actually loved Sadie ‚Äì she treats him pretty horribly throughout the book as he does to her at times. I get that friends can treat each other poorly, though I struggled to believe Sam and Sadie‚Äôs bond given that they get into these intense arguments all the time and then resolve them by‚Ä¶ forgetting and forgiving instead of communicating through the conflict and processing what actually happened?? Idk, maybe my best friendships are so healthy to the point where it feels a bit incomprehensible to me (shout-out toBrione of my bestianas who‚Äôs also on Goodreads!)As a side note, I think I‚Äôm spoiled because I read Jhumpa Lahiri‚ÄôsThe LowlandandUnaccustomed Earthearlier this year and late last year respectively, and she sets the bar so high in terms of characters with rich inner lives that then manifest in their interpersonal relationships. Hanya Yanagihara pulled this off too inA Little Life, though I don‚Äôt recommend her other books lol.I also felt frustrated by the overall treatment of friendship in this novel. For the first 60% or so, there‚Äôs this implicit and explicit theme of friendship being important and special and not inferior to romance. However, this deteriorates when certain events happen later on in the book. Like, at the very end, Sam literallysays that he felt insecure that Sadie didn‚Äôt want to be with him romantically/physically because of his disability, his Asianness, his lack of wealth‚Ä¶ which implies that he actually wanted a romantic relationship with her all along‚Ä¶ which undercuts the importance of friendship. YikesLike, Sadie is a white woman from a wealthy background, why did Sam feel so entranced by her?? Idk, it reminds me a bit too much of Asian men who are obsessed with white women‚Äôs approval and being attractive to white women instead of loving themselves (likethis tweetdepicts). And I don‚Äôt think Zevin sufficiently showed an arc of Sam learning to love himself, even if imperfectly, which would have been my preference even if it‚Äôs not everyone‚Äôs.Anyway, as you can tell this book was engaging enough that it elicited this long of a review from me. Again, I was entertained and immersed so I can see why so many people hyped this book. Not my favorite though a story with interesting elements and relevant social commentary for sure.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""My first dnf of the yearüòÖ I had so much appreciation for this book while reading it so I can see why so many people love it but I personally was a bit bored tbh.

Sam, whose foot has been crushed in a car accident, hasn't spoken to anyone for months but meeting Sadie, and playing video games with her, brings Sam alive, pulls him out of his pain and heartbreak. That friendship lasts for a while until one of them feels betrayed and then it's over.Eight years later an accidental meeting has them back together. Their love of gaming, their ability to create games, leads to collaboration and the making of games. They are successes at game making but that success pulls them apart again. While the playing field can be even for everyone when they start a video game, giving everyone the same chance to build and conquer, the real world sees everyone differently. One gets more credit than the other, resentments and misunderstandings grow. Even when working together, Sam and Sadie are apart in the most hurtful ways.This is the story of Sam and Sadie but Marx is a part of that story. Marx, who plays games but doesn't make games, becomes a crucial part of Sam and Sadie's company and their lives. Marx is the best friend a person could have, he's the best partner a person could have, he's the mediator when it's needed, he's the glue that holds things together. He's the person Sam tries to imitate when he doesn't know how to go on.This story contains three decades worth of brilliance, creativity, friendship, love, romance. jealousy, resentment, isolation, miscommunication, and more. Maybe some huge successes require people to be somewhat broken and misunderstood. Definitely love does not have to be romantic to last a lifetime. When it comes to Sam and Sadie, it's taken them years and years but I do think they finally mature in the end and there is something to be said for a maturity that might allow estranged people to come back together.There is lots of talk about creating and making games and playing games. Sometimes we are in a game. I loved all of that. I understand gaming and I can get lost in the worlds that allow us to forget our real world. Worlds that allow more than one life, dying doesn't have to mean death, you have more chances to go on or start over. All of that is so interesting to me and I laughed whenever the word dysentery was mentioned. But this story really got to me because there is a lot of sadness, isolation (something gaming can even cause), and anger. I wanted everyone to be able to be a Marx. But that's not how the world works, not everyone can be a Marx, life is not that easy for everyone. I'll be thinking about this story for a long time and will probably see it differently as time goes on. It will take me a while to get over this story, I'll need time to let it just settle in my mind.Pub July 5, 2022""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is my first taste of author Gabrielle Zavin, and I have to say I was impressed, this is beautifully written and smart storytelling that goes back and forth in time, embedded in the world of gaming. I am not a gamer myself, so if you are not either, do not let this put you off, because this is essentially about the all too human aspects and the complexities of what it is to be human, the connections made through this medium, such as the relationships, the friendships and the joyful delight to be found in a perfect digital world, a sharp contrast to the problems and difficulties that are to found in the more messy real world. Sam and Sadie first meet fortuitously in the late 1980s as children in a hospital, finding common ground in playing games, like Super Mario, competitively.Memories comes flooding back when they meet again years later at a rail station as we follow their lives evolving through the decades, as they begin to create games together, setting up in business together, the creative input balanced by the grounding and practical presence of Marx. They do extremely well which brings all the pressures and trappings associated with success. The characters are vivid, distinct and from diverse backgrounds, in a narrative that touches on a wide variety of issues and themes that resonate, like identity, love, loss, family, technology, race, disability, betrayal and inevitable failures, and what is important in life.We are given a insightful glimpse into the gaming industry, its history and business side, and how gaming can help people endure hard times through the escapism it offers. A brilliant and imaginative read that I think will appeal to many readers.

The idea that if you keep playing, you could win. No loss is permanent, because nothing is permanent, ever.‚ÄùThe PlotA chance meeting at a hospital is to connect the lives of Sadie and Sam through video gaming and home entertainment. A relationship that is tested, grows, changes, and suffers from many of the obstacles life creates - love, greed, misunderstanding, vanity, discrimination, domestic violence, abuse, death and many more.However, the constant in their lives is the love and ambition for inventing and playing video games. Yet, like many winning partnerships, their loyalty is tested when fame and success enters their lives and the two struggle with each other, despite the intervention of their loyal friend Marx.While the book includes many side stories and sub plots, the core to this book is the relationship between Sadie, Sam and also Marx with some important themes for the reader to reflect on. There is a sad moment in the book that will play on my mind tomorrow, and tomorrow and tomorrow!!! But I will not spoil here.Review and CommentsIt was all about the writing style and relationships for me that took the meaning of gaming to a whole new level. The characters felt so real and genuine which came through in the writing and turned a seemingly ordinary plot into something extraordinary.My favourite character was Marx although the two characters at the centre of the story were well developed and had such redeeming and less desirable qualities which I loved because this felt ‚Äòreal‚Äô.There are a few elements to the story that did not work so well for me. For example, using the title and references from Shakespeare‚Äôs Macbeth (and others) ‚ÄúTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow‚Äù implied there was going to be a connection and relevance to the gaming world. The sense of infinity yes but some of the Shakespeare quotes peppered throughout just didn‚Äôt work and at times it felt awkward. Only an opinion.I also believe that my reading experience would have been marginally better had I been more familiar with the gaming jargon. So, I decided to set that aside and focus on the relationships at the centre of the story and only then did the book make sense to me.A modern take on some timeless themes. A story of reinvention, infinity, and the possibility of a different life, but also a stark reminder that life is complicated, complex, painful and sometimes intolerable but it is also what we make of it. Despite the distractions and when the game of life becomes the cruelty of life, it is up to the individual to decide on the appropriate course of action, because after all there are no rules and no winners. Just love and friendship made better through willingness and forgiveness.The focus on relationships was superb but I particularly loved the reinvention of Sadie and Sam‚Äôs relationship and the quote that says it all‚Ä¶‚ÄúThe way to turn an ex-lover into a friend is to never stop loving them, to know that when one phase of a relationship ends it can transform into something else. It is to acknowledge that love is both a constant and a variable at the same time.‚ÄùI loved that ‚ÄúLove is both constant and variable‚Äù. True of many relationships. Overall an excellent book, there is no doubt that this book will continue to be enjoyed by many tomorrow, and tomorrow and tomorrow!!!.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '**WINNER OF GOODREADS FICTION GENRE, THIS ONE IS SPECIAL**Initially I had trouble getting through parts of this book and even put it aside for a day. Some of the details of designing, coding and playing video games were tedious for me to read.However, when I tried to get into another book ‚Äì the characters of THIS BOOK kept calling me back. From 30% on I was invested and fell in love with Sadie, Sam and Marx.It‚Äôs important to note that this book covers several decades so it‚Äôs hard to describe all that happens with these characters!!Sam and Sadie meet in a hospital. Sadie is there to visit her sister, who is undergoing cancer treatment, and Sam is a patient. He was in a horrific car accident and his foot has been repaired but it will never be normal!! He will be in constant pain!!Sadie and Sam bond over their love of video games, mazes, etc.‚ÄúThey had the rare kind of friendship that allowed for a great deal of privacy within it.‚ÄùThere is a point where Sadie and Sam don‚Äôt see each other for years but when they are back together the magic is still there. Ideas are worked out together, code is written, Marx is the producer and promoter andfor a long time all is good.As with all human relationships that span decades, these three will go through many changes, and it‚Äôs wonderful to watch how they grow. All the emotions are here, friendship, love, happiness, grief, depression, exuberance ‚Äì all so well described that I felt it with them!!The writing in this book is absolutely wonderful. I love this quote from Marx‚ÄúWhat is a game? Marx said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow.

There is a specific kind of sentimentality or emotion that just does not work for me at all, but that a lot of people find extremely compelling. It is a matter of personal taste, it is not really about whether a book is inherently good or bad. You either like a book that will purposely tug at your heartstrings or you don't. I don't, ergo this book was not for me.The thing is, that I liked the first half of this book pretty well. I enjoyed the way we see Sam and Sadie, who became friends through playing video games as kids, and the way they come together and then break apart. I liked seeing how their grudges and resentments could trickle in to cause problems, and then it could all be erased through their joy of gaming together.About halfway through this book I started to get suspicious. I had a feeling that we were being set up for something. That the stakes were being purposely heightened. I did not like it! I kept seeing danger around every turn when that was not what kind of book this was. Until, well, I ended up being right after all. I did not like the last half at all. It felt manipulative and bordering on maudlin. It didn't feel like it really earned what it was going for. Also, slight spoiler thoughts behind a tag,Marx is just not a real person! He has no flaws, apparently, besides sleeping around in his early 20's. He is handsome and charming and loyal and apparently good at everything? I never bought his relationship with Sadie and it felt contrived just to give Sadie something to grieve. He is basically an ex machina to make everything happen in the book, it got very annoying.I do not think you need to be a gamer at all to read this book. I'm not and I was able to be invested in everything along the way. Zevin is deft at explaining what makes a game compelling without boring anyone. Ultimately this is a book about friendship that just happens to be set around video games.There were lots of little things that irked me along the way (I will be so happy if I never read another book where a character attends Harvard) particularly Dov's character, who is a pretty terrible person but that everyone decides is just fine because all that happened so long ago, right? It was pretty weird, especially since he treats the only major female character so badly. But there were also lots of little things that I enjoyed, little threads that Zevin would drop and then pick up again (secret highways, the history of Sam's mother, etc.).I just wanted to read a perfectly boring book about Sam and Sadie working together, the highs and lows of their friendship. (In a lot of ways this is similar to a bottle episode of Mythic Quest that I liked a lot, though this had the potential to be better because it was based on friendship more than romance.) But I suspect this book's target audience isn't interested in that and they are here to have their heartstrings pulled. If that is you, there is a lot here that I think you'll like. And the video game elements really serve to distinguish it from the pack.I did the audio version of this book, the reader had actually also read another book I'd read just a few days earlier. I like her style, which she does adjust to the material, but is more of a flat reading than an overly emotional one. I think it suits, balancing out some of the elements in the book. She also has to do a lot of accents, which she manages quite well.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""‚≠êÔ∏èGoodreads Award Best Fiction‚≠êÔ∏èMy top read for 2022. A brilliant coming of age masterpiece, spanning almost 30 years. An epic tale of friendship, love, art, video games, and the journey of life.As a teen, I played my fair share of Sonic, Mario Brothers, etc, but nothing with the intensity of this book, realistic games that blur reality and fantasy. I was immersed.Gabrielle Zevin weaved a layered story, carefully crafting characters within the backdrop of gaming. She was able to peak my interest which speaks to the beauty of her writing.This is the story of Sam and Sadie, Sam and Marx, Sadie and Marx, and their journey building a successful gaming company. Sam and Sadie meet in the most unexpected places-a hospital. Sadie's sister is undergoing cancer treatment, while Sam, is recovering from a major injury that leaves him disabled. Sam and Sadie connect over their love for games. Sadie becomes an integral piece of Sam's life and his recovery.Time moves forward, Sam and Marx are roommates at Harvard. Marx is an aspiring actor while Sam pursues his passion for making games. One day, Sam happens to meet Sadie on campus (she's there for a gaming meeting) and they connect (over Oregon Trail of all things). Sadie gives Sam a game she's working on, and the rest is gaming history--a story of creating amazing, creative games together.Tomorrow, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow (an ode to MacBeth, which later, ties beautifully into one of the characters arcs) is the story of missed opportunities, successes, pains, love, and a passion for art.There is a time for any fledgling artist where one‚Äôs taste exceeds one‚Äôs abilities. The only way to get through this period is to make things anywayZevin not only created amazing virtual worlds I'd love to play, she wrote an entire chapter within a game--literal genius. There was also a chapter in second person, which may feel out of place to some, but made sense in the context of the character's journey.Initially, I was bogged down by all the gaming conversations, but it's worth it to continue reading. The beginning ties in wonderfully as we learn the struggles of creating true art. Zevin also touches upon some important cultural/political topics that helped move the story along.The truth is, I cried and cheered for these wonderfully written characters, like friends more than fictional souls.I recently read, 'The Storied Life of A.J. Fikery,' and became an instant fan of Zevin. It feels remarkably coincidental that her new book came right after--alas, the stars aligned.I savored Tomorrow, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, felt protective of the words, and had a sense of reverence to the story. Have you ever felt a physical reaction after finishing a book? I was in a melancholy state, wanting to be transported into the pages, stilling time.How could a person still be as young as he objectively knew himself to be and have had so much time pass?As I closed the last page, my daughter wanted to be tucked into bed, yet I wanted to sit with the book and fall asleep- savoring the story. It was hard to let go, say goodbye. The characters came to life in a way that felt tangible.There was the life that you lived, which consisted of the choices you made. And then, there was the other life, the one that was the things you hadn‚Äôt chosen. And sometimes, this other life felt as palpable as the one you were living.^^This quote moved my soul.5 spectacular stars!""}]"

Definitely worth the read.I‚Äôve rewritten this review three times now, andeach time I‚Äôve felt it necessary to lower my rating.I don‚Äôt intend for this to be a hot take. I‚Äôm not trying to be unique or quirky for disliking a popular book but every day I grow more and more concerned with the number of people who misinterpret and romanticize this book. There will be spoilers in this review.I‚Äôd like to begin by acknowledging Colleen Hoover‚Äôs intent with this book and how I believe it is a serious problem.Firstly,Colleen Hoover has expressed her disapproval and dislike for trigger warnings.She expressed that‚Äúas a fellow reader with my fair share of past experiences, I understand that there are issues some people do not want to read about. But as a writer, there are many things I don‚Äôt want revealed in the blurbs of my books.‚ÄùThis is extremely irresponsible and inconsiderate of an author.Furthermore, this book has been and is marketed as a love triangle andColleen Hoover employs the fact that Ryle is an abusive fucker as a plot-twist.In the author‚Äôs note, she states that ‚ÄúIn the past, I‚Äôve always said I write for entertainment purposes only. I don‚Äôt write to educate, persuade or inform. This book is different.‚ÄùYet, she continues to format this more serious book, similarly.Furthermore, although I understand that Colleen‚Äúwanted to write something realistic to the situation my mother was in ‚Äì a situation a lot of women find themselves in‚Äù, I feel that Ryle was very different to her father.This coming explanation is just my presumption and random thought process. I could have greatly misinterpreted what Colleen went through and I do not mean to be disrespectful.I do not doubt that domestic abuse can be very different, but I believe the fact that Colleen‚Äôs father was an alcoholic has a huge impact on her final opinion of him. One could argue that her father needed help, and that although he is to blame, it did not come purely from malintent and manipulation. I am not saying that he is redeemable by any means, only that part of the violence can be due to an unintentional factor. Ryle still ends up having custody over the baby. This is infuriating to me.But we see that she wrote it this way because Colleen still had a relationship with her abusive father after her mother divorced him.Then we have the way that Colleen\'s father continues to (in my opinion) manipulate her by showing kind, good aspects of himself, like agreeing and encouraging Colleen‚Äôs stepfather to walk her down the isle rather than him. Just a thought or something to possibly consider.And in this book, we see Ryle presented as, not a bad person, instead, only a""person who does bad things"".Now, I\'ve been thinking about this line.I wonder if it was Colleen‚Äôs intention to have Ryle say this line to purposefully show how he manipulates Lily into having this mindset or if Colleen really does think this way.Ryle is indeed a bad person, and abuser who is irredeemable. I understand and agree that it is at times, difficult to label someone as ‚Äúbad‚Äù or ‚Äúgood‚Äù as it is more complicated than that. But there comes a point, that person is a bad person (for instance, when he tries to horrifically rape her and guilt-tripped Lily with his trauma). Colleen attempts to evoke confliction in the reader by writing in that Ryle donates to charity. Yet, this is not enough. One donation does not make you a good person, especially when compared to the severe harm that you‚Äôve caused others. I cannot believe that after Ryle attempted to rape Lily, there are still Ryle apologists out there. That moment was absolutely mortifying.Regardless, the general plotline of this book is supposed to be that Ryle starts off as being a kind, loveable man with whom Lily and the reader fall in love with. But, his abusive and manipulative tendencies are slowly revealed until it becomes clear that he is an abuser and that this is a case of domestic abuse. However,from the beginning of the book, Ryle is already portrayed as a concerningly violent and manipulative man.We are introduced to his character when Lily finds him kicking a chair out of anger, something unacceptable and very worrying. Later on,he begs and successfully coerces Lily into having sex with him, purely and solely because he wants to.Unfortunately, at this point in the story, many people still like, possibly even love, Ryle. This is not the ""turning point"" per se.I‚Äôve also recently seen many people criticizing Colleen Hoover‚Äôs ability to write a healthy relationship and I‚Äôm beginning to agree. Although I remember enjoying Ugly Love, it was certainly unhealthy, specifically in the way that our female main character was treated. Then I began to read ""November 9"" and was utterly mortified by the way Ben, our love interest, acted. There are plenty of reviews with quotes etc. that show how horribly and scarily Ben treated Fallon from the beginning, before the plot twist.So, I conclude that Colleen‚Äôs failure to properly structure a base for the story to build upon was a main concern.In regards to Ryle‚Äôs trauma,it is something that he weaponizes to manipulate and guilt-trip Lily.It does not excuse the abuse and I think it‚Äôs gravely concerning for people to blame the abuse on his trauma. Although it‚Äôs understandable to feel bad for what he had to go through, it is all used to manipulate and abuse Lily.Then we have Atlas. When I first read this book, I was quite taken with how caring and sweet Lily and Atlas‚Äô childhood romance seemed to be. But upon reflection, I‚Äôve become more and more concerned by Atlas‚Äô presence in this book at all.I‚Äôve seen countless girls swooning over the‚ÄúI know it wasn‚Äôt a pity fuck, Lily. I was there‚Äùline, yetAtlas had sex with Lily while she was a minor.I question why Colleen Hoover would choose to make it that way. It‚Äôs extremely unnecessary and the illegality of it could have been easily avoided had she chosen for them to be the same age.This again shows Colleen‚Äôs inability to write healthy relationships.Furthermore, I found that the side romance in general greatly took away from the purpose of the book.The fact that Lily had to be saved by another man is truly a damaging thing to portray. Many women who experience domestic abuse do not have the option to leave just because there is a better man out there and it‚Äôs also damaging to make it seem that Lily is simply picking between Ryle or Atlas.Moreover, this expands my discontent with howColleen chose to shove in aspects of her usual work to something so serious.A side love story was truly unnecessary for this, but I believe Colleen knew that if she wrote something without romance, it would not sell. Can I blame her for that? I‚Äôm not quite sure, but it certainly does not please me.Deriving from what I‚Äôve mentioned so far, particularly about Ryle,it bothers me how little conclusion Colleen offers at the end of the book.I have had to have conversation after conversation with people who misinterpreted the book, who still forgive Ryle and who think of ‚ÄúIt Ends With Us‚Äù as a romance book. For a while, my challenge question (for friend requests) was ‚ÄúWhat is your favourite (dark) romance book and why?‚Äù And I cannot tell you the number of times people answered with ‚ÄúIt Ends With Us‚Äù. Some people write in their reviews that even though Ryle was not Lily‚Äôs ultimate partner and just because it ‚Äúdid not work out‚Äù, they will still have love for Ryle in their heart and think that he just needs help. And unfortunately, I don‚Äôt think these people are to blame.With Colleen still allowing Ryle to have custody, it almost allows for a small redemption for his character. And I believe at the end of the book, Colleen should have written one page with the cycle of abuse and how it was shown throughout the novel, and a conclusion expressing that if you love Ryle,you should not,because everything that he did, he did itconsciously and with purpose, through manipulation and guilt-tripping(weaponizing his trauma). I do appreciate however, that she included the domestic abuse hotlines.I also thinkit is unacceptable for people to be recommending this book as just a ‚Äúsad book‚Äù or a ‚Äúbook to make you cry‚Äù, becausediminishing a book that explores such a difficult and serious topic like domestic abuse, to an object that simply serves the purpose of evoking emotions from you, is extremely disrespectful and shallow.Especially considering that this is such a personal book to Colleen Hoover.Another thing that I found to be really damaging about this book isthe audience.There is this#coquetteaesthetic on tiktok that I am sure you are aware of. I really to like the look of it etc. But it is a theme among this aesthetic to read books like ""It Ends With Us"" and ""Lolita"". I believe both of these texts are greatly misinterpreted, especially considering that it is often young girls who are reading these books from the ages of 11-15. Ignoring Lolita as that is a different topic,I am nearly certain that these girls buy books like ‚ÄúIt Ends With Us‚Äù purely for the cover.It\'s pink. And it fits the aesthetic.I see people saying that they ""love"" ‚ÄúIt Ends With Us‚Äù and I find it greatly concerning. What do you love about it? I see people ignoring Lily\'s plotline and just adoring Atlas and his whole ""I know it wasn\'t a pity fuck, Lily. I was there."" They\'ve transformed this as something to romanticise. Not to mention thatI also see girls giggle at what seems to be a little inside joke of theirs when they quote""where did you get the magnet lily""or""you fell down the stairs"".I am really beginning to think that this book has done more harm than good.The writing wasn‚Äôt something I had a problem with.When I see people criticize Colleen Hoover, it tends to be becausethey call her writing ‚Äúwattpad writing‚Äù which is stupid, because people will say that any contemporary romance has ‚Äúwattpad writing‚Äù.That‚Äôs not a great criticism, they should actually elaborate. Other than the quotes that I‚Äôve disagreed with like‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no such thing as a bad person, only people who do bad things‚Äù, I found that Colleen Hoover‚Äôs writing flows well and that she has some iconic, well thought out quotes.I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of Lily writing her letters to Ellenand I didn‚Äôt really care at first, but in the Acknowledgement section of ‚ÄúIt Ends With Us‚Äù, Colleen actually says thankyou to Ellen DeGeneres saying that she is‚Äúlight when it comes to darkness‚Äù. Considering what an awful person everyone knows that Ellen is, I again struggle to understand why Colleen chose this specific detail when she could have chosen someone that was a much better person and influence. *I have been informed that because this book was written in 2016, Ellen was not known to be a bad person,although I still question Colleen\'s decision to make Lily write letters to a talk show host.Veering off that topic and coming back to my problems with Ryle, is thatI strongly despised how he cared for Lily when she was pregnant.I felt that Ryle cared more about the baby than Lily, and it continues to portray women as baby machines who are made to serve a purpose.The way he cared for her stomach and touched her stomach rather than her. It‚Äôs disgusting.Something that also boiled my blood isthe internal misogynythat I see Colleen weave into her books.Lily chooses to not decide whether to divorce Ryle or not until after she has the baby becauseshe believes that her decision would be affected by her hormones.What the fuck?????? Was the fact that he tried to rape you and then he beat you not clear enough?Furthermore, when Lily is trying to explain to Ryle that she wants to divorce him, she tells him something along the lines of‚Äúwhat if this baby girl came home to you and told you ‚Äòdaddy, this boy hits me but he apologized and said he wouldn‚Äôt do it again‚Äô, what if she came home with bruises‚Äù, and only then does that garner any sympathy from Ryle.This situation parallels the instances when men only feel remorse for things like sexual assault when they are told ‚Äòwhat if it was your mother and sister‚Äô.It‚Äôs horrible and it made me deeply upset that I‚Äôve seen reviews admiring how Ryle was ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù after Lily explained that to him.I believe Lily was a strong character to a degree and I agreed with the way she responded to certain things (or I would have done the same), but there are times where I would have been gone, and Lily stayed (like when Ryle begged her for sex). Still, you can really tell she did have a certain level of logic and reason, and tried to confront Ryle.Something that really bugged me was the characterDevinand how Colleen Hoover writes him asthegay stereotype.He\'s overly touchy with Lily, touching her breasts and pulling down her bra without her consent. This is truly such a disgusting and rude way to portray characters of the lgbtq+ community, especially considering that Colleen Hoover rarely diversifies her books(very few poc + lgbtq characters). It mainly frustrates me because Colleen Hoover clearly has a huge income from the sales of her books, and that she cannot be bothered to get sensitivity readers or better editors for these things is so concerning.Another thing that was kind of unnecessary was this line:‚ÄúA 2-year-old girl will have the same name even when she‚Äôs 22, Lily Bloom. Names aren‚Äôt something we eventually grow out of.‚ÄùI understand the meaning behind this sentence, suggesting that parents should put thought into their children\'s names, and that it should suit an adult as much as a child. But I also understand that this can be seen as quite inconsiderate towards transgender people, and just people who change their names in general, because that\'s obviously possible too.There are just so many things that could have been easily avoided, and for these things to not be noticed and fixed is quite lazy of the author.Despite my problems with this book, I think the general idea that Colleen Hoover tried to present in this book was executed decently well at times, hence my two stars.This is a very difficult read, especially if you relate to any of it at all so please do check trigger warnings and be careful because it can be very uncomfortable to see yourself in someone like Lily, or in her position. Much love to anyone who has been through anything like this, I hope you‚Äôre okay <3‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ ‚ô° ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""::: SPOILER-FREE REVIEW :::Fifteen seconds. That‚Äôs all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we‚Äôll never get back.HOLY WOW!It Ends With Usis one of the mostpowerfulbooks of 2016 and one of the most raw, honest, inspiring, and profoundly beautiful stories I've ever read. It wasn‚Äôt anything like what I expected, but it delivered so much more than I ever hoped for. This is the kind of book that I want to give to every woman and just be like‚Ä¶ READ THIS BOOK. NOW. Come to think of it, all the men should read it too. EVERYONE should read this book. Absolutely everyone. It's a story of unshakable love and finding the strength to make the right choice in the hardest situation. I honestly don't think I've ever been prouder of a heroine. I've loved Colleen Hoover's books for a long time because she always writes unique stories... and this one left a lasting mark on my heart. It is a MUST-READ!!This is a completelyspoiler-free review. I'm not even going to add the blurb or tell you what this book is about. It's a Colleen Hoover book. That should be enough to tell you it's amazing. But I really feel that you should just dive into this book without knowing anything about the plot. To be honest, I'm the usually the kind of reader who likes to know every little thing about what to expect in advance, but I've really learned to trust Colleen's writing and her storytelling so even I went into this book without knowing anything at all... and I was blown away by the story!This book isunputdownable. You'll notice as you read that there are no good stopping points. None at all. I began reading it late at night and every time I tried to put it down to go to sleep, I just had to get back up and keep reading because I couldn't stop thinking about it. I didn't finish until almost 5AM but my gosh was it ever worth it!Of all the heroines I've ever read, Lily was most certainly one of the ones I admired the most. I knew loved her from the first few pages, but having finished the book, I truly couldn't be prouder of her. Her strength and conviction over the course of this story made her into a heroine I'd want every girl and woman to read about and look up to. She was so real and vulnerable as we all are, but the strength with which she took control of her life was admirable on such a deep level. I just wanted to hug her and cheer. I don't think I've been this proud of a fictional character before.There's an incrediblypowerful messagein this book that is very subtly woven in from the start. It begins in the first chapter, but you don't yet realize howsignificanteach of these moments truly are... and as you read more, these pieces of the story come together forming a scenario that gives such a raw, honest portrayal of an incredibly relevant issue. I'm not mentioning it on purpose because I don't want you to expect it.The fact that it's unexpected for you as the reader is very important because it's also unexpected for the heroine.As she begins to realize what kind of situation she's in, so do you. And this realization very much allows you to experience her journeywithher.The only thing I want to address head on is the question of the 'love triangle' because a few of you have read the blurb and have asked about it. All I want to say is to please try and move away from that thought. I don't want to spoil the plot at all, but that is so not what this book is about. That is not the point, or the focus. Whatever it is you're thinking this book is, just trust me -- it's so much bigger than that. Seriously, trust Colleen. I did.As a romance reader, I found this book incredibly refreshing. As much as I adore the romance genre (and I really do), it sometimes can get a little repetative. As both an avid reader and a blogger, I'm always looking for books that step outside the lines a little; ones that do something different or take the issues a little deeper. This book represented exactly what I wish I could be reading all the time -- not this literal story, but just the fact that it went in such a different direction and gave me such an unexpected story that left me with such a strong message.One of the things that intrigued me the most and had me wondering when I heard about this book was what the title really meant -- and there's this very specific moment when the title is echoed in the story that just had such astrongimpact as I read it. That was my cheer moment. I just sat back and went 'woah!'. The title is truly perfect.In order to write this review, I went back over the book a second time and one thing I noticed strongly was how many intricate layers there were to the story that I couldn't possibly have known about in my first read. I loved that this is one of those books you experience differently (in a good way) both the first and second time though.I have to say that this book would make aseriously amazing movie. I could picture every scene so clearly as I read. This is also such an incredibly relevant story for many people -- whether they've personally been through what happened to Lily or they know of someone who has -- so I really do hope that one day this makes it to the big screen.My copy of this book is literally filled with highlighted quotes in every single chapter but I made a conscious decision not to add any to this review because I really truly do not want to give anything away about the story. Just trust me and jump into this story blind. I promise that it is a reading experience you don't want to miss.This began as one of my most highly anticipated books of 2016 and it is now of my top favorite books of the year. I was unable to put it down from the moment I started reading and I know that this is one of those profoundly beautiful and unforgettable stories that will stay with me for a long time. I highly recommend it toeveryone!That‚Äôs what fifteen minutes can do to a person. It can destroy them.It can save them.Rating: 5+ STARS!

I never know how I‚Äôm going to react.Allow me to explain what went wrong for me with this one . . .Let‚Äôs start with the obvious annoyances that seem to be in nearly every NA book that drive me batshit before getting to the real nitty gritty. First, the character names. Ryle, Lily Bloom and Atlas???????Is it against the law tonotuse absolutely ridiculous (‚Ñ¢Ron2.0) names in these books????Second . . . .‚ÄúYour lips. I love how they‚Äôre as red as your hair.‚ÄùAccording to Google (all hail Google) less than 2% of the world‚Äôs population has red hair, and yet 99.998% of all NA leading ladies do. Just stahp.Third, non-existent chemistry. In this story Lily and Ryle meet by chance on a rooftop after experiencing respective miserable days. In a matter of minutes Lily goes from worrying the stranger on the roof could be a psycho killer/rapist to getting into his super sexy (NOT) pick-up lines . . .‚ÄúIf you wouldn‚Äôt sleep with someone you just met . . .‚Äù His eyes meet mine again. ‚ÄúExactly how far would you go?‚ÄùEwww.

I took a gander at my friends‚Äô reviews before I started typing this and noticed my buddyChelseawas the only other naysayer in the batch. She summed it upperfectlywhen she talked about the massive amounts of emotional manipulation that was forced down the readers‚Äô throats in order to make them feel all the things.It‚Äôs a running joke with my friends/family/co-workers that I have a robot heart. And for the majority of the time it‚Äôs true. I generally experience two emotions ‚Äì happiness and annoyance. But even a robot like me can be manipulated into having a feeling/crying the ugly tears like a Kardashian once in a blue moon (*coughMe Before Youcough*). This time, though? It was like a flashing neon sign . . . .To begin with, our first leading male Atlas is a homeless teenager who Lily befriends/eventually loses her virginity. In case you don‚Äôt get the writing on the wall, Atlas is being set up as the most perfect perfection that ever perfected. He‚Äôs also the way to getting the ‚Äúraised in an abusive household‚Äù plotline uncovered. Like in all NA stories, Atlas and Lily are torn apart. Lily moves on with her life, graduates college, yada yada, and, as mentioned above, meet-cutessuper creeperMr. Right 2.0 on the roof. Mr. Right 2.0 is not only another most perfect perfection that ever perfected, but he‚Äôs alsorichand aneurosurgeonand very obviously husband material even though he‚Äôs never had a girlfriend (also after dating only six months),annnnnnnnddue to their mutually busy schedules not really knowing the guy.It wasn‚Äôt too hard to see where the story was going to go (and no, I hadn‚Äôt been spoiled because I didn‚Äôt read any reviews or the synopsis, I just auto-request everything by Hoover from both NetGalley and the library). Basically this was a story about domestic abuse and making excuses not only the first time he knocks your ass down ‚Äúon accident‚Äù but also the second time when you wake up after ‚Äúfalling‚Äù down the stairs and hearing his sob story about a superbadawful that effed him up as a kid and then agreeing on a policy where‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre upset, just walk away. And I‚Äôll walk away‚Äù(becauseTHAT‚ÄôSgoing to fucking work) and then saying‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, Ryle. It‚Äôs okay. You were angry, it‚Äôs okay‚Äùand making sure even when you‚Äôre bleeding profusely out of your fucking skull and are concussed and have quite possibly just been raped by your own damn husband that you get taken to an emergency room in a hospital other than the one where your bastard abuser works in order to protect his ass as well as explaining‚Äúsometimes the reason women go back is simply because they‚Äôre in love‚Äùand in case all that wasn‚Äôt e-fucking-nough you add in a whoopsie baby (another NA per usual) to serve as the wake-up call that maybe it‚Äôd be a good idea to ditch this zero and eventually find you a hero,buuuuuuuuuuuutyou just come to an agreement regarding visitation and whathaveyou rather than involving the court and much needed supervised interaction because youknowhe wouldn‚Äôt hurt the baby since it‚Äôs obvious he loves her . . . .Nope.I‚Äôm well aware I‚Äôm going against the grain here. I give zero fucks.

Reading this book will change your life. It‚Äôs so different from any of Colleen Hoover‚Äôs other books. You can tell it‚Äôs heavier, more personal, just more. This book is deep. It‚Äôs profound. It‚Äôs a book that needs to be read. I'll repeat:THIS IS A BOOK THAT NEEDS TO BE READ!This story is moving. It will make you think about things that are uncomfortable to think about. It will lift your heart, devastate you at times, make you proud, fill you with sorrow and make you smile. It will move you. It‚Äôs powerful and intense in the best way, but also has hopeful and lighter moments. The story itself is one that has been heavy on my heart from the moment I finished it.Sometimes, I read a book and it‚Äôs so beautiful, influential and emotional I will cry just thinking about the characters and their story. Not in a bad way necessarily, I just get that moved and that emotional while thinking about it. That is this book. Trying to find the words for this review is bringing me to tears. It‚Äôs hard to explain the story completely spoiler free, but this isn‚Äôt a ‚Äòsad‚Äô book. It‚Äôs a strength book. Because dealing with the issues in this story took so much strength.I‚Äôm not going to talk about the actual story at all, but I will speak a bit about the characters.Lily. Speaking of strength, Lily may be the strongest heroine that I‚Äôve read about. Your strength is really tested when you are put in a hard situation where your choices are impossible. I loved Lily so much. I was proud of Lily and the choices she made. I want to be Lily when I grow up.Fifteen seconds. That‚Äôs all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we‚Äôll never get back.There are two men in this story, but please don‚Äôt think this is a triangle book. It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs hard to explain, but it‚Äôs not.Ryleis a charming guy. He‚Äôs a giving person. He‚Äôs got a lot of great attributes. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôve ever felt so conflicted over a character as I did him.Atlasis the type of man I always have a soft spot for as a reader. His story gutted me at times, but he is also a character with a lot of strength and so much beauty. I loved Atlas from the second I met him and that love never stopped throughout the book.‚ÄúLily?‚Äù he whispers, looking at me sincerely. ‚ÄúYou just might be the best thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me.‚ÄùAside from the three main characters in the story, Lily‚Äôs mom played a prominent part. Their relationship played an even bigger part. Ryle‚Äôs sister and Lily‚Äôs best friend Alyssa was one of my favorite characters in this book. When things got hard she was there. One line she said in the book, to Lily just solidified the type of woman she was. Coleen always writes that one side character that you love so hard in her stories, and Alyssa was that character for me. I can‚Äôt not mention Ellen, because, well, it‚Äôs Ellen. That part was brilliant. It made me smile every time Ellen was mentioned.When reading this book, there were moments I struggled between not being able to tear my eyes away from the page, and others I had to take a breather because I couldn't handle what was going on.Parts of this story left me so heartbroken and others lifted me up so high. There are some parts that are just so powerful I could only read them in awe. This is it. This is why I read. Books like this.All humans make mistakes. What determines a person‚Äôs character aren‚Äôt the mistakes we make. It‚Äôs how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses.Colleen Hoover is an author who truly has a way with words. She killed this book. I‚Äôve read and loved all of CoHo‚Äôs books. Some of her earlier books are some of my all-time favorites. I‚Äôve enjoyed all of her latest books, but this is by far the best book she‚Äôs ever written. And it‚Äôs tied withHopelessas my own personal favorite book by her. And that is saying a lot, becauseHopelessis one of my top books ever.If you only read one book this year, let it beIt Ends with Us. Everyone needs to read this book. 5+ star favorite.

If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear.‚ÄùIt Ends with Usis the most personal and daring and painful bookColleen Hooverhas ever written. Abuseanddomestic violenceare a delicate subject, and when I found out they were this book's main theme I thought about not reading it. It was a moment of cowardice, a moment I didn't want to witness this side of relationships. But I owed it to myself, as a person and as a woman to proceed. Because pretending a problem doesn't exist does not make it disappear. There will bespoilersbelow so if you haven't readIt Ends with Us, you should probably stop here.‚ÄúFifteen seconds. That‚Äôs all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen.‚ÄùNaked truth coming. I was one of the people who don't understand. The people who, when they hear about abuse, the first thing that occurs to them iswhy doesn'tsheleave him? Why does she let her fear guide her, and she's so selfish that makes her children witness such horrors inside their home, that was supposed to be their sanctuary?But what we should ask iswhat is wrong withhim?Instead of making excuses and trying to justify him, we should take a moment and consider how she feels, and the difficult decisions she has to make.Ryle broke my heart into millions of pieces.I fell in love with him, and I kept wishing that Colleen would delete these words, these scenes that hurt me and disappointed me and shattered my belief in happy endings. A part of me, a part I tried to smother, a part I am ashamed that exists, wanted him to change. To try harder, and for Lily to let him try harder. Me, who judged them for not leaving. In the end,I felt sorry for Ryle. For losing the love of his life, for destroying his only chance at happiness. I don't forgive him, I just wish that a magic wand would make everything better.‚ÄúSo much gravity, pushing down on my emotions. Everything shatters.My tears, my heart, my laughter, my soul. Shattered like broken glass, raining down around me.‚ÄùLily is a hero.She haddignity, andcourageandstrength. At first I was judging her mother for staying, but witnessing through Lily's eyes her challenges, feeling her heartbreak and her dilemmas, made me regret all the ugly things I thought. Loving the person who hurts you is a greater torture than the physical act itself. And damn it I loved Ryle, and I hated Colleen for that.I hated her for making me swoon and laugh when she was about to shatter my soul.The Katerina that startedIt Ends with Usis a different person than the Katerina that finished it. Remorseful, destroyed, wiser.‚ÄúLife is a funny thing. We only get so many years to live it, so we have to do everything we can to make sure those years are as full as they can be.

When I re-read this in prep for the new one and then diving right in to it, I feel the need to change this rating to a 2. However, I will be leaving my original review up.It Ends With Us... Wow I really don\'t know what to truly say about this novel. This review will be a little light because, like most CoHo books, you\'ll want to go into it with little to no information. I went into this book thinking it was going to be this one thing, and it turned out to be the complete opposite.IEWUfollows Lily, a girl in her early twenties, who has never had it easy. Though coming from a family that was better off she has always had to work for the things she\'s wanted. After graduating college she gets up and moves to Boston and hopes to start her own business. While there she meets and falls for Ryle, a thriving neurosurgeon who is determined to be the best in his field. The two hit it off hard, and things seem almost too good to be true. Ryle is everything that Lily is not. He is forward, assertive, and stubborn. He is also a lot of thing Lily is; he is strong, passionate, and motivated. Though the two have an immediate connections and sparks fly, the two decided to take their time getting to know one another. Lily is such a beautifully written leading lady. I loved getting to grow with her and be apart of her journey. I loved hearing her thoughts and seeing how she processed things. When I was first reading and got to the point where she does her journal entries, but she does them so they are letters to Ellen DeGeneres, I thought I wasn\'t going to like that aspect of it. The first few had me thinking ""this is a little cheesy"", but the more I got into it the more I started to enjoy them. They really tied Lily\'s past and present perfectly together. As Lily\'s and Ryle\'s relationship pushes forward she finds herself looking back at those entries and thoughts of her first love Atlas resurface. Atlas was her first everything and was the biggest impact on her life. Atlas was the homeless boy who found his way into the abandoned house next door. Atlas and Lily as teens formed an unlikely friendship. Sharing everything and having a bond that no one around them seemed to understand. Spending every possible moment together and having so many stolen ones the two were kindred spirits. When Atlas reappears in the story it truly threatens everything Lily and Ryle have. (not a spoiler it\'s given he eventually will). Both Ryle and Atlas bring such important and different aspects to this story. I think CoHo manages to make them both such polar opposites, but at the same time manages to make them mesh so well.The characters in the book, main or side, all feel so realistic and authentic.When it comes to the plot there is almost nothing I can say about it. I hope everyone will do the same to keep things from getting spoiled. The story is an emotional roller coaster from start to finish. It\'s one of those books that you will have a thousand theories about and all of them will be wrong. I kept trying to guess what I thought might happen next and in classic Hoover style she managed to surprise me. This book was solid from page one and was steady throughout, but around the 80% mark is where things really took a turn (in the best way possible).IEWUhit me on such a personal level. I didn\'t expect this book to impact me so hard. It had everything I wanted from a New Adult read. It\'s very classic CoHo, but it also branches out somewhere she\'s never been before, but she does it with such ease. She manages to weave these heavy moments with ones that will make you swoon, laugh, and then cry. My favorite part of this book though, was the author\'s note. Usually author\'s notes are at the beginning of the story, however it is so important that this one was left for the end. It took a book that was good and made it exceptional! God, this note effected me like so few books have. It made me cry fifty times harder than the entire book or anything Colleen\'s ever written.Finding out how important this book was for her to write will hit you hard, but I hope she also knows how important it is as a reader to read. Knowing where an author gets their ideas from can change your whole outlook on a book, and this one... this one broke me.Thank you Colleen Hoover for continuing to gift the reading community with your words.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Dear Colleen,I find it fitting that I write this review as a letter to you the way Lily would write to Ellen. Don\'t ask me why, I really don\'t know. What I do know is that I haven\'t been on Goodreads in nearly six months and it\'s entirely your fault that i\'m here now. So, if i stumble upon a poor review on one of my books and end up in the fetal position on my kitchen floor surrounded by Ding Dong wrappers, well, I\'m blaming it on you. I\'ve even given my husband instructions to bill you for the psychiatry bill if that happens.On Friday I had a hysterectomy. It wasn\'t the worst day of my life, but it certainly wasn\'t the best. One chapter of my life--quite possibly the best chapter--ended. The surgery itself took twenty minutes. Twenty minutes. Can you believe that? Twenty minutes to take out the uterus that carried my three beautiful babies for a total of twenty eight months. Twenty minutes to change my life. Don\'t feel bad for me, that\'s not what I want. The offending organ had to come out, I knew this. But it didn\'t make it any easier. It didn\'t make the finality of the situation any easier. In all honesty, for a couple of minutes I didn\'t just feel like a chapter was ending, more like an entire flipping book. Maybe my life isn\'t made up of chapters, maybe it\'s part of a duet, or a trilogy? Either way, part of my story was over.Over a matter of several hours, I slowly woke up from surgery and at one point I remember sitting there and just staring at the wall paper in my hospital room.My uterus was gone.Mauve diamonds.The wallpaper was covered in mauve diamonds.That\'s the most hideous color, don\'t you think? Mauve. Not quite pink. Not quite maroon.I counted seven hundred and fifty three diamonds before I allowed the first tear to fall. But I wasn\'t just crying for losing a part of my body, and I wasn\'t crying for losing the ability to carry more children. I was crying because some women don\'t even get to experience what I\'ve gotten to experience. Some women never get to have babies. They never get to feel them grow in their bellies. They never get to see the slimy little monsters as they tumble their way into this world.And I did.I got to do all of that three times.So why was I so upset? What the hell was my problem? I should be grateful, right? Happy?My husband slept soundly in the chair, snoring softly, but at some point my cries must have woken him up. He stirred and I did the only thing I could do ... I grabbed your book. You see, it was sitting on my bedside table. I buried my nose between the pages and when my better half asked me if I was okay I simply peeked over the top of the book and whispered, ""Colleen. She did it again.""I didn\'t need to say much more, he knows my obsession with your words and I found myself grateful. Grateful that he knew your books make me cry and grateful that you inadvertently allowed me to grieve. And that\'s what I did. I read your book and I grieved. I cried when Lily cried. I cried when Ryle cried. And even when no one was crying, I still cried simply because I needed to and I could and no one thought twice about it because i was reading and that\'s what i do when i read. It was my outlet, my excuse for the tears that wouldn\'t go away, the tears that kept falling despite my desperate protest.I cried for all of the Lily\'s in the world, and the Ryle\'s too. I cried for the Atlas\'. And I cried for the Kirby\'s (that\'s my name. No i\'m not named after a vacuum, or a cream puff)But you see, I didn\'t want to cry. I didn\'t want to be upset. I have three beautiful children whom I love with my entire heart. My body did it\'s job extremely well and that is something to be proud of. But why wasn\'t I proud?Naked truth?I\'m selfish.I wanted one more baby even though my husband didn\'t. I wanted one more baby when there are women out there that can\'t have any at all.So why am I telling you this? My story is nothing like Lily\'s. Not even close.But maybe it is ...She wanted something she shouldn\'t want. I wanted something I couldn\'t have. She had a decision to make ... one that would change her life. So did I. She made a decision that was right for her and for her life at that particular time.Ditto.But the real reason I\'m telling you this is because for two days I was drowning and It Ends With Us was my lifeline. It\'s what I grabbed when I needed to stop thinking ... it\'s what I grabbed when i needed to cry ... and when i finally finished the book and put it down, it wasn\'t mauve diamonds that I saw ... it was my smiling children.My three beautiful smiling children ... and my niece Lily.-- Kirby'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '""We all have a limit. What we\'re willing to put up with before we break.""When was the last time a book just completely slayed me, cutting me so deep and evoking such strong emotions? It feels like my heart has been filled, then broken, filled, then broken. In the end, I\'m stunned by what I read.It Ends with Usstarts out innocently enough. We follow the courtship of Lily and Ryle. He is handsome, successful, and so thoroughly smitten with Lily he can barely think. He makes advances while claiming he doesn\'t do relationships. She rebuffs him while secretly pining for him. Really, it\'s all fun and a bit frivolous, your standard romance.But then we arrive at the crux of this story, which I\'ll try my best to be vague here so as to minimize the spoilage. (Though at this point, with all the hubbub surrounding the movie, I\'d be surprised if there is anyone out there who doesn\'t yet know what this is about.) Nonetheless, it\'s best to read it from Colleen Hoover\'s own words, and what an astounding set of words they are.Make no mistake, this isn\'t a romance even though it starts out as one. Instead, it\'s a considerably more honest look at relationships‚Äîtheir ups and downs, and what really happens when the rosy tint wears off and it turns out one person has bigger issues than the relationship can contain. As a result, it asks us readers the very uncomfortable question of just how much we are willing to put up with for love.I will say, the main topic in here is something that a lot of books try to tackle, but very few do right. Often books will go heavy-handed in making one character out to be the villain, as if afraid that a more subtle approach will somehow be misconstrued as condonement. But this does a disservice to the entire situation, making it difficult for us to understand the other character\'s perspective as well as their reasons for being in the relationship in the first place.What makes Hoover\'s portrayal so masterful is her nuanced approach. She brings a humanity to both sides that is sobering and heartbreaking, and it makes the whole thing ring true. It\'s brutal and compelling, and it\'s hard to look away.I think for those of us fortunate enough to never have been in a situation like this, it\'s easy to take the ideal road and turn our noses up at anything less than the puritanical view. But real life isn\'t like that at all; it isn\'t black and white. It\'s filled to the brim with all sorts of gray, day in and day out. And Hoover shades in the gray with a skillfulness that is so raw and visceral, it often made me forget where my lines are.Many people think that Hoover is romanticizing what is going on in here, but that isn\'t it at all. In making Ryle the complex person that he is with good qualities, and in making Ryle and Lily\'s relationship happy most of the time, Hoover actually manages to explain the most confounding paradox of abusive relationships‚Äîthat they are good or even great most of the time, and that the victim is neither too dumb to realize they\'re being mistreated nor are they too lazy to affect change. But rather, the victim needs to be exceptionally strong and well-supported in order to leave behind so many good moments in order to cut out a few bad ones.I read this book years ago when it first came out, and I remember thinking highly of it, though not much else. So when I read it again this time, I admit I was shaken by how hard it hit me. I think it\'s because I\'m older now and have more experience with love and relationships, so I\'m able to appreciate this story even more.My suggestions if you\'re going to read this book‚Äîhave a box of tissues ready and don\'t skip the author\'s note at the end. I sobbed my way to the finishing line, then read the author\'s note and sobbed some more. This is a riveting and worthwhile read, though at times difficult, and it showcases Colleen Hoover at her best, taking her contemporary new adult genre and elevating it to soaring heights.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:It Starts with UsVerityReminders of HimRegretting YouUgly LoveLayla~~~~~~~~~~~~‚úßConnect with me‚úßInstagram‚úß'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Preventing your heart from forgiving someone you love is actually a hell of a lot harder than simply forgiving them.4 1/2 stars.Holy crap, what a book.This is unlike anything Hoover has written before. I have so many emotions right now that it\'s hard to know where to start, but I think everyone should read this book. That\'s right: everyone.I could easily give everything away. I could, but I won\'t. If you go looking for lots of reviews, it won\'t be hard to work out whatIt Ends with Usis about. And if you do, you should still read it, but I think it\'s better if you don\'t. I think you should go into this book knowing as little as possible. Just realize that this is something very different from Hoover\'s usual new adult romances (that I admittedly have hadallkindsofproblemswith).So I don\'t want to say too much, but this is anextremely powerful storyand it\'s not what most people will be expecting. It gets its power from the singular first person narrative (I\'m honestly not a big fan of the alternating male/female POV romances) and we experience everything through Lily\'s eyes. When she falls in love, we fall in love; when her heart is broken, our heart is broken; when she gets it all wrong, so do we.I cannot stress how important anddamn smartthis book is. There is no black and white characterization - it\'s much deeper and more complex than that, and therefore, far more emotional.It peels back the layers of characters and relationships to do something that so many other authors have tried and failed to do - to make you understand a situation that for most people makes no sense. It\'svery sad, painful and exceptionally honest. My heart hurt while reading it and I almost cried several times.As well as all this emotion and sadness that I\'m being coy about, Hoover also brings out some of her very best writing. Little gems of honesty about human nature and relationships that are all the more painful because of their resounding truth. It\'s such a quotable book, but unfortunately most of the quotes are spoilers, so I shall refrain from posting them.There\'s so many great things to mention, but I keep getting distracted by myfeelings. The narrative is interspersed with letters that Lily wrote as a teenager and they are addressed to Ellen Degeneres - a strange touch that ends up being absolutely perfect. Shit, just writing this review and remembering the story is an emotional experience.And then there\'s theabsolutely fantastic female friendship. I want Allysa to be my best friend. Hoover clearly knows her audience of 16-25 year old women, creating characters with their quirks and habits - Allysa, for example, is a self-confessed ""Pinterest whore"", which made me laugh. But seriously, she is the best friend ever and she says one of the most perfect lines in this book.Anyway, I\'m just going to start rambling soon because I read this book in a whirlwind of emotions throughout a single day. I\'ve been up since a ridiculous time and I need to go sleep now. But really, give this book a chance. I thought it was excellent.Trigger Warnings:Domestic abuse (physical, occasionally graphic).

I promise.""I\'m convinced anyone who gives this five stars is not sane. It contains the typical ~ I don\'t do marriage~ love interest, but somehow, he magically wants a committed relationship and kids with our lucky lady after a few interactions. We love being the only exception. It ends with us contains a lot of dark elements such as abuse, toxic relationships, and attempted rape. I understand this novel is based on the author\'s experience, but that doesn\'t mean it\'s good, nor am I obligated to like it. There\'s absolutely no justification for abuse, and why Lily continues to stay is beyond my comprehension. Throwing away your morals just because someone is hot has got to be the stupidest thing ever.The author added numerous poor book decisions; I\'ll list some of them here:1) The main character\'s full name is Lily Blossom Bloom, and she runs a florist shop. Do I need to say more?2) Lily is obsessed with Ellen Degeneres to the point where Ellen becomes the 4th main character of the story.3) Ryle knocked on 29 apartment doors simply to find Lily and proceeded to beg on his knees for her to fuck him.4) Lily\'s bedroom light turned on at the exact perfect moment, just as Atlas was about to commit suicide. Wow, what a mere coincidence. He thought she was an angel beaming in the light. He said, and I quote""I ~felt~ something,""that\'s the reason why he didn\'t want to kill himself anymore.5) Every repetitive""just keep swimming""reference.6) Ryle put a big picture of Lily on his wall after their first meeting. Was this supposed to be attractive?7) The typical let\'s invite my gay best friend as my date to make Ryle jealous, only for the gay best friend never to reappear again. I smell a plot device.8) This quote >>""There\'s no such thing as bad people, just people who do bad things.""9) Atlas slept with 16-year-old Lily when he was a legal adult.10) Lily names her daughter Dory after the fish in Finding Nemo.11) Colleen Hoover has the most unhinged sentences:""When he was wiping that cow shit on me, it was quite possibly the most turned-on I have ever been.""I do, however, understand the valuable and worthwhile message it sends. It\'s difficult to leave someone you love in such situations, which are never black and white. It is so hard that you come up with excuses and can even make the truth sound like made-up lies. I previously stated that I couldn\'t understand why Lily never left Ryle after the first incident of assault happened. It contradicts what I said just now about the author\'s message, but that\'s because I\'ve never understood their chemistry. Lily said she couldn\'t leave because she loved him too much, which was strange. It was merely a case of physical attraction. There\'s also no reason for the author to randomly throw a bunch of serious topics (homelessness, guilt, infertility, abuse, suicidal thoughts) just for the sake of making the book forcefully emotional and not going more in-depth about them. Furthermore, I was not too fond of the plot and didn\'t connect with a single character. I don\'t understand why Ryle didn\'t get help, especially when he could do things similar to their daughter or another partner. That man better stay the hell away from me, or I will seal him up in a trash bag and hit him to the moon with a baseball bat. In conclusion, I will never touch another Colleen Hoover book.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'My additional thoughts on the book adaptation and my movie review:I love Colleen Hoover so much, I‚Äôd probably even read her shopping list if she published it‚Äîher perfect blend of angst and tear-jerking emotion always gets me! I also really enjoyed the movie‚Äîthe performances were strong, the emotional depth was moving, and the powerful, liberating message against domestic violence truly resonated with me.However, I can‚Äôt stand the ongoing feud between the lead actors. It needs to end! They need to make peace, especially with the It Starts with Us sequel coming up. It‚Äôs time to put the drama behind them and focus on what‚Äôs next for the fans.Here are my thoughts on the movie:https://medium.com/@niluferyozmekik/i...‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-Oh my! Argh! This is me confronting my ripped apart heart pieces after reading this book! Actually, I read the book a long time ago. I was too scared to write a review because writing meant opening up about my feelings. This book hurt me a lot, and I couldn‚Äôt find the right words to describe the ‚Äúhurt‚Äù it gave me.Honestly, this is my longest Coelho reading because I put it down several times. I got pissed! I screamed! I clenched my fists so hard! I cursed the entire family tree of Ryle Kinkaid! I haven‚Äôt wanted to hire contract torturers to kidnap a character and give them the punishment they deserved for so long.The things he did to Lily‚Äîthe physical and emotional abuse‚Äîwere impossible for me to absorb. I felt breathless and gave up several times. This book sledgehammered my heart and crushed my soul!I returned to my reading because the beautiful love story between Atlas and Lily was like seeing sunshine through dark clouds, giving me the only hope I could hold onto. I honestly thought of only reading the flashbacks to warm my heart!What if they had reconnected that night when they accidentally met again at the restaurant? What if Lily had gone back to him instead of choosing a path with Ryle? That scenario made me so happy, but it would never be the same without the tremendous angst Coelho threw at us because she is an expert at bringing out the dirtiest, ugliest cries of regular human beings! And without pain and suffering, so much sadness, we don‚Äôt feel like we‚Äôre reading an actual Coelho story, do we? Never!This book is being developed into a screenplay! It‚Äôs so compelling to read this heart-stabbing, soul-sledgehammering story without consuming tons of paper products to dry the tears we may shed. I cannot imagine how the movie will affect me. But sometimes words hurt more than actions, and I‚Äôm sure no screenwriter has the ability to reflect all the emotions Coelho made us feel during our reads.So my advice: stock up on all the paper products from grocery stores, lock yourself in a soundproof room so as not to scare your neighbors with your screams and howling sounds, and give your entire concentration to this lyrical, insanely heartfelt story.It‚Äôs one of the most compelling, sad, and sensational Coelho books. I could hardly digest the emotional turmoil it gave me! But it‚Äôs worth the pain. Especially that meaningful, sentimental, poetic ending melted my heart.I made some adjustments for clarity and flow, while preserving the original emotions and tone.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'I don‚Äôt believe in disliking things just because they are popular. I went into this with the intention of liking it, but ended up feeling uncomfortable by the tone of this book. Although I wholeheartedly respect the personal nature of this story, the author‚Äôs note does not exempt this work of fiction from criticism, especially when it comes to a topic as serious as domestic abuse.I empathize with the main character Lily and I appreciate the effort that was made to highlight how trauma distorts and lingers, but I don‚Äôt believe this captured the severity or nuance that a topic this heavy deserves in fictionalized work. This book is marketed as romance, and the synopsis makes it seem like a lighthearted love triangle instead of a woman‚Äôs experience with spousal abuse. In comparison to Kate Elizabeth Russell‚Äôs harrowing depiction of abuse inMy Dark Vanessa, the tone ofIt Ends With Usfeels acutely inappropriate. It reduces domestic abuse to a lovers quarrel and presents a tactless caricature of the realities of abuse. I can acknowledge this may not have been the intention, but the elaboration in the authors note does not absolve this book of its reckless and irresponsible marketing.It Ends With Ushas the bones of a powerful story but reads like a low budget Hallmark movie pushed forward by ridiculous plot revelations. Hoover‚Äôs attempt to make Ryle into a three dimensional character completely flops. At first, I thought the accelerated relationship between Ryle and Lily was meant to emphasize how witnessing abuse in early age might make you less likely to spot red flags in others; however, it turns out Hoover was really trying to create a deep relationship between these two. Her use of ‚ÄúNaked Truth‚Äù to build their relationship was a lazy ploy to circumvent true development and simulated an unsatisfying and unearned intimacy. I also found the use of teenage diary entries in the form of letters to Ellen DeGeneres to have aged really badly, and comes off as a corny device to tell rather than show readers about Lily‚Äôs relationship with Atlas.The single redeeming quality of this book is the empathy that Lily develops for her mother towards the end, but this moment, as well as the ending, lacks sufficient nuance. I wanted more discussion, I wanted more development, and I wanted less telling and more showing. Although the message that the cycle of abuse ‚Äúends with us‚Äù is personal for Hoover, I feel like this depiction is reductive and makes it seem like walking away is a choice all women have. Hoover maintains that this book was meant to show that domestic abuse isn‚Äôt black and white, but I don‚Äôt think it achieved that at all. She made the conscious decision to pit romance and abuse against each other, packaged it with a pink cover, a synopsis free of any mention of abuse, and marketed it to impressionable young adults. However well intentioned this cathartic passion project was, its reception as a work of fiction is devout of nuance, the white knight message ofIt Ends With Uscompletely undercut by its blatant romanticism of abuse.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""this book sends a really important and worthwhile message, but it's not necessarily enjoyable.IT ENDS WITH US was not what i expected it to be. i started the novel knowing next to nothing about the storyline except that it's a colleen hoover book (NA romance) and that it'sgood(my friends kept raving). but if i'm being honest, i wasa little disappointed.i was hoping for a light read with lots of ~FEELZ~ but instead i got something much more intense ‚Äì not bad, just unexpected.the main plot revolves around abusive and toxic relationships within families. it really opened my eyes to the emotions of those in these types of situations and helped me gain a lot of perspective. because of this, i think it's important to read this, but it's not enjoyable. it's definitely a really frustrating process to read.for the majority of this novel, i DIDN'T like it. i was definitely interested and curious, but i didn't care for the characters as much as i thought i would. i was frustrated and annoyed at the situations, and some of it felt artificial, rushed, and stereotypical. it all seemed so... fictional. usually the romance satisfies me, but even that didn't do it. buuuuuut it wasn't so much that i didn't NOT like it. it was simply okay when i expected it to be ~amazing~.there were two romantic tropes that bothered me because i don't like the tropes themselves and because i didn't think it was executed THAT well: insta-love and love triangle.ryle was too good to be true; a hot, young, smart, compassionate, arrogant, sensitive, rich guy suddenly appears and falls head over heels for our main character. they ‚Äì somehow!! ‚Äì meet again and this time he's literally BEGGING to have sex with her. suddenly, this fuckboi wants to be in a committed relationship and plans on having kids with our lucky lady. um......... okay????? i didn't feel anything for their relationship and ryle seemed like a plot device to me. and when she didn't leave him the first time, i knew i KNEW he would do much worse again. and i didn't feel surprised when it happened; i didn't feel surprised when she asked for the divorce ‚Äì a little relieved maybe, but not surprised.then there's atlas, who i felt had more depth than ryle and lily but also not thaaaat much. he was probably my favorite character, but i felt his story (the letters) were kinda.. anti-climactic? their relationship was confusing to decipher, but i still loved them. it made me sad to think lily didn't end up with atlas IN THE FIRST PLACE but i guess that would make the whole purpose of the book redundant.even though i didn't enjoy the process of reading this book, i'm grateful to have read it. there are some books you read for pleasure and there are some you read to gain knowledge and perspective. this is the latter.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Phenomenal!This book will make you fall in love, rip your heart out and force you to reconsider your preconceived ideas about abuse.

I don't cry very often, but this one had me crying big, fat tears.It's been a couple of days since I finished 'It Ends With Us' and I'm still thinking about Lily's story. It's one that'll hang with you. In so many ways, her story gutted me. Yet, it was also inspiring.Lily grows up in an abusive household. After watching her mother suffer for years at the hand of her father, she tells herself that she'll never allow any man to treat her that way. She grows into a strong and independent woman, leaving behind the horrors of her childhood...Or so she thinks.Despite everything she's promised herself, Lily finds herself in an abusive relationship. The behavior and cycle is so insidious that you almost can't believe what is happening. Ms. Hoover manages to weave the violence into a relationship that is otherwise seemingly perfect. It is so skillfully written that you won't want to believe what you've read.I found myself making excuses for the abuser. I didn't want to believe that he wouldn't change.

Queen of Shadows (Throne of Glass, #4)
",Sarah J. Maas,4.61,1025071,6133,"Young Adult, Romance, Fae, Fiction, Magic, Fantasy, Young Adult Fantasy",648,01-09-2015,"An alternative cover edition for this ISBN can be foundhere.Everyone Celaena Sardothien loves has been taken from her. But she‚Äôs at last returned to the empire‚Äîfor vengeance, to rescue her once-glorious kingdom, and to confront the shadows of her past‚Ä¶She has embraced her identity as Aelin Galathynius, Queen of Terrasen. But before she can reclaim her throne, she must fight.She will fight for her cousin, a warrior prepared to die for her. She will fight for her friend, a young man trapped in an unspeakable prison. And she will fight for her people, enslaved to a brutal king and awaiting their lost queen‚Äôs triumphant return.The fourth volume in theNew York Timesbestselling series continues Celaena‚Äôs epic journey and builds to a passionate, agonizing crescendo that might just shatter her world.","[{'rating': 5, 'content': '‚ÄúMaybe the world should burn.‚ÄùEpicness.That\'s the only word I can think of to describeQueen of Shadowsin order to encompass its complexity and awesomeness, because while I lovedThrone of GlassandCrown of Midnightblew my mind away andHeir of Firebroke my heart into teensy tiny pieces, neither of those installments felt as grand as this one -- worlds collided, debts were paid and a queen rose to her glory.‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go rattle the stars.‚ÄùI\'m going to start by saying that I\'ve read it twice in a matter of days -- once devouring it cover-to-cover, fueled by that insatiable need to find out what the hell happens next (pulling an all-nighter, if I might add), and then simply to savor its cleverness, awed yet again at Sarah\'s ingenuity. But as I finished it for the second time, I realized something extremely important: QoS is a tribute to strong, tough heroines, main and secondary alike.‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù Lysandra said, waving a manicured hand, ‚Äúyou and I are nothing but wild beasts wearing human skins. Don‚Äôt even try to deny it.‚ÄùYou will be completely astonished with the unraveling of Aelin Ashryver Galathynius, because in reality you haven\'t exactly met her until now. You see, she\'s the same heroine we\'ve come to love during these past 3 (4) books and yet a different persona. Every trait of Celaena Sardothiens is magnified and combined in such a masterful way to create a unique character. She\'s still an arrogant, stubborn, brave and sassy young woman, but she undergoes a spectacular character-development into a cunning, determined and fierce queen. Aelin is completely in control and she makes a statement in bold capital letters that she doesn\'t buy any bullshit and that she\'s ready to reclaim back everything that was taken from her. And oh, boy, she does it in style.‚ÄúI went too long without demanding retribution. I have no interest in forgiveness.‚ÄùIn addition to that, she has matured a long way and, for the first time, she shed her impulsiveness for being open-minded, calculating and often kind. Aelin managed (through those crushing sessions of healing from HoF) to lose some of her darkness and her real strength -- spiritual and physical alike -- finally shone in this installment, making me so proud of her at this point. And I\'d bet a good deal that Sam and Nehemia are freaking proud of her too.*sobs*‚ÄúI miss you,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúEvery day, I miss you. And I wonder what you would have made of all this. Made of me. I think‚ÄîI think you would have been a wonderful king. I think they would have liked you more than me, actually.‚Äù Her throat tightened. ‚ÄúI never told you‚Äîhow I felt. But I loved you, and I think a part of me might always love you. Maybe you were my mate, and I never knew it. Maybe I‚Äôll spend the rest of my life wondering about that. Maybe I‚Äôll see you again in the Afterworld, and then I‚Äôll know for sure. But until then ‚Ä¶ until then I‚Äôll miss you, and I‚Äôll wish you were here.‚ÄùNow onto the next awesome woman and quite possibly my favorite character from this book: Manon Blackbeak. She was completely fabulous in a mind-boggling manner. I never would have expected her wonderful character-development: she is not all about discipline and obedience anymore. She starts wondering. She starts plotting. She starts taking a stand, slowly but surely, like Dorian did in CoM and later in HoF. She\'s gloriously wicked, but she\'s no evil and I utterly loved her. I cannot wait for when her defiance will leave the witches kneeling at her feet.And damn, when those two met?! Shots fired. Fireworks exploded. And badassery was brought to a whole new level. It was by far my favorite scene out of the whole novel, managing to exceed my expectations thousand fold -- they were deadly and powerful and so goddamn magnificent I was literally fangirling. The encounter in its entirety was astounding by starting out surprisingly and unfolding in an incredible way that only increased my adoration for both kick-ass chicks.‚ÄúWe are the masters of our own fates‚Äîwe decide how to go forward.‚ÄùThe attention falls equally on some other ladies. Prepare to fall helplessly in love with Asterin. She\'s so strong and loyal and her story will move you to tears. We finally get reacquainted with Kaltain and she\'s not in a place full of flying unicorns and pink rainbows -- she\'s basically in her own hellhole. There were a few fascinating developments that transformed her into a worthy, lethal player. Nonetheless, her inner strength was awe-inspiring and I ended up regretting that we didn\'t get to know her better before. She was hands down amazing and she has my unwavering respect and admiration.‚ÄúShe did it for herself. To free herself. And she was entitled to. After what they did, she was entitled to rip the entire damn world to shreds.ÔøΩÔøΩThis book allowed us to meet new kick-ass females: Lysandra, who was nothing short of amazing and surprising; Elide Lochan, who was determined and immensely brave; and Nesryn Faliq, who was simply awesome in every way. I loved and cheered for them all.And now let\'s fuss over the boys. Firstly, Chaol. His reunion with Aelin was all sorts of shit, no, this-can\'t-be-happening, and I was mad at him for his demeanor. With that being said, I can assure you he remained true to his character throughout the whole book, his loyal, selfless traits reminding me why I like him so much and his insecurities being in sync with his overall upbringing, legacy and priorities. With Dorian\'s safety being his ultimate goal, his desperation is just gut-wrenching.‚ÄúOath-breaker. Liar. Traitor. Chaol was all of those things now, but not to Dorian. Never to his true king.‚ÄùSpeaking of Dorian, my sweet, precious and innocent cinnamon roll. He killed me in this book. Killed me with his few and far between chapter POVs that had him in pure, unaltered agony and pain. Killed me with his loneliness, with his sense of being lost, with his acceptance that he\'ll drown in an ocean of misery and cold. And finally he killed me with his force to constantly fight back, with the desire to tear free of the monster inside him and with the protection he bestowed on his loved ones. He\'s done kneeling before others and he is forever changed, but wonderfully so. I loved loved loved him, even when he broke my heart.‚ÄúI am going to destroy everything you love.‚ÄùAedion was undoubtedly a new favorite of mine. The fact that he\'s Aelin\'s male version is only a shade of his real personality -- he had me tearing up and smiling at the same time with his boundless love for his queen and his loyalty and sarcasm were a recipe for instant swooning. Oh, and his father? I went bazinga.‚ÄúBehind them, across the hall, the dancers shattered their roses on the floor, and Aedion grinned at his queen as the entire world went to hell.‚ÄùWe meet again with the King of Assassins, Arobynn Hamel, and he did not disappoint with his cruel, scheming, controlling self. He was a ruthless bastard but the satisfaction I felt when the pupil outwitted the master was priceless. Bon voyage, you shameless asshole.‚ÄúTell me what I must do to atone; tell me to crawl over hot coals, to sleep on a bed of nails, to carve up my flesh. Say the word, and it is done. But let me care for you as I once did, before ‚Ä¶ before that madness poisoned my heart. Punish me, torture me, wreck me, but let me help you. Do this small thing for me‚Äîand let me lay the world at your feet.‚ÄùRowan Whitethorn is yet again a main focus of the book and I enjoyed everything about him. His devotion, his wisdom, his alpha-male intensity and not to mention the rare moments when he let emotions overtake him. Aelin\'s effect on him really brings out sides we haven\'t met before and the fact that he was, at times, sweet (yes, I\'m talking about the King of Stoicism) continues to blow me away.But the best part about these characters is not even themselves. Their intricate relationships are the real deal. TheBROMANCES ARE FLAWLESS-- Dorian and Chaol redefine friendship, Aedion and Rowan set the backbone of a brotherhood for ages, Aelin and Manon bring a delicious and unpredictable frenemy dynamic to the table and the queen regains female companionship through Lysandra. Aelin and Aedion are even more amazing then I ever would\'ve imagined and their reunion was all kinds of splendid (I was crying, goddamit) and the Thirteen prove again just how much of a family they can be. Besides these, the original trio crawl their way to being once again a marvelous team -- Dorian and Aelin is possibly the best thing ever, maybe only topped by Dorian and Chaol. Banter and kinship and support and dedication are all etched deeply in every single relationship, giving them an almost magical quality.‚ÄúFor her friends, for her family, she would gladly be a monster. For Rowan, for Dorian, for Nehemia, she would debase and degrade and ruin herself.‚ÄùNow -- expect romance. The wowza kind. The slow-burning kind. The tension off the charts kind. One ship is sailing fast, folks, and it is steamy and romantic and snarky and just asdfghjkl. I\'m not saying who it is just in case you escaped the spoilers. There are new feelings on the horizon for a certain male and I hope it will come to fruition soon. And and and maybe I\'m a fool to hope or even bring it into discussion, but do I sense Dorian and Manon?!?BECAUSE I\'M DOWN FOR THAT, MAAS.All my talk about characters shows how incredibly balanced QoS is, because this book is very much plot orientated. So many twists coming from Arobynn and the Valg world and the rebel cause and bitch queen Maeve and the King and the Duke (turns out he\'s a key player) and I can\'t even. The Valg plotline is an endless well of terrifying territory and it seems that we\'ll venture further into their scary world. It\'s thrilling, jaw-dropping and fabulously written. The last 200 pages or so were a masterpiece, keeping you glued to the pages and at the edge of your seat, but the entire book is darker and bloodier than any of its prequels.‚ÄúElegant, feminine, and utterly wild. Warm, and steadfast‚Äîunbreakable, his queen.‚ÄùQoS is not necessarily flawless. I have slight complaints -- like Rowan being a bit too soft sometimes and Dorian and Chaol not getting enough page time -- but they don\'t irk me because I got so much more awesomeness instead (all of the above + Abraxos and Fleetfoot, of course) and I am fully aware we can\'t have it all; it was almost a 700 pages book! My favorite still remains Heir of Fire though, with QoS and CoM not far behind, because that book broke me into pieces and did not apologize for it. However, QoS did with that phenomenal ending that had me smiling ear-to-ear and teary-eyed at its sheer perfection. It was like SJM personally apologized for every time I cried and sobbed and went crazy over her devastating story and gave me a solace of utter joy. Happiness is not a good enough word to describe what I was feeling at the dinner scene.Yet again, Sarah J. Maas pulled out the big guns and took over the fantasy genre with a gorgeous world, otherworldly characters and imaginative plot. She is my favorite author and, even though I\'m aware of her storytelling skills, she continues to bewilder me with each book she creates. I got literally everything I asked for (seriously, my initial ""demands"" can be foundhere), even the things I thought were impossible to come true. So thank you, SJM, for this outstanding book.‚ÄúShe was the heir of fire.She was fire, and light, and ash, and embers. She was Aelin Fireheart, and she bowed for no one and nothing, save the crown that was hers by blood and survival and triumph.‚ÄùQueen of Shadowsis a breathtaking continuation to my favorite series -- a truly wild rollercoaster, brilliantly woven with plot twists and thrilling from beginning till end, and also an absolutely beautiful journey sprinkled with countless gut-wrenching moments. Enthralling, action-packed and heartwarming (yes, you read that right), this book deserves every praise known to humankind and I bow down to the queens in eternal awe -- Sarah and Aelin, you\'re both spectacular. Cannot wait to see what you have in store for us next.‚ÄúWhat do I do?‚ÄùShe had to swallow before she said, ‚ÄúYou light up the darkness.‚ÄùENJOY! <3P.S.:It pains me to see how a lot of people hate this book due to its main romance. I love Dorian to the moon and back and Doraelin is basically my OTP and for that I could\'ve downright hated CoM, QoS and especially HoF (miss you, Sorscha). Obviously, I didn\'t, because what a lot of fans fail to acknowledge is that we shouldn\'t get blinded by the shipping-war. I NEED them to take a step back and appreciate the glorious world Mass created, the ingenious plot and the ever-wonderful characters. Romance was never the main focus of these books, even if it sweetened the installments and gave us butterflies. After all, a choice was bound to happen sooner or later seeing we have such swoon-worthy males around our beloved heroine and need I remind you there are still 2 more books? Anything could change! Maybe everyone will die in the end -- would you prefer that instead of watching your ship sink? (Sarah, please don\'t get any ideas). Regardless, I\'ve said it times and times again -- as long as Aelin is happy, I\'m happy, and if that means Doraelin isn\'t endgame I\'m not going to bawl like a baby about it, because she deserves to have someone at her side and she deserves to choose whomever the hell she wants. Team Aelin forever.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'When my sister told me about an early review that promised really bad things happening to our favorite characters in this installment, I didn\'t care. I didn\'t actually think that was true; ItrustedSJMAAS. Butoh, dearnothing could have prepared me for what I was about to face the moment I picked up this damn book. With this review I\'m putting these book down and getting some needed rest. I think we all deserve it after dealing with Aelin and the author\'s bullshit, am I right?Now, let\'s get down to business.How to ruin a book series by adding absurd romantic subplots and destroying some characters for the sake of a ship: A novel by Sarah J. Maas.Prepare yourself for QUEEN OF BULLSHIT. This one was definitely my most anticipated book of 2015, and reading it was an absolute torture.I\'m outraged and sad and deeply disappointed that one of my favorites series is now such a piece of crap, but I\'m certain that I am done with SJM\'s work. What she did to this series--to its characters--is an insult to the readers. This is not a book--this is poorly written fanfiction of theThrone of Glassseries.(If you listen closely you can hear Sam and Nehimia yelling that they didn\'t die for this shit.)I\'m gonna miss you, Celaena Sardothien.The assassin we all loved was murdered. She was sassy, smart, badass and arrogant, but in this bookthe author turned her into a fucking fangirl, Aelin Galathynius. She did not only act out of character--she became dependant on a hot fae dude who\'s centuries older than her. SJMAAS failed at creating an empowering female character. Aelin Galathynius was a self inserted version of the author, a poor caricature of Celaena Sardothien.If you think that the way Aelin acts in this book is how a queen should be like, Wyrd help y\'all.Celaena would never hurt Dorian, yet Aelin was so eager about killing the Crown Prince who was posessed by a demon. She never stopped to think for a damn minute of what her actions would cause to the friends she loved. No--she was so obsessed with Rowan that everything else what pure background. While Chaol and Nesryn worked to free Dorian from his father, Aelin showed the city to her fae companion. She socialized with Lysandra, she wore dresses for Rowan, and she had dinner with her cousin and her new friends. And when they finally managed to rescue Dorian, Aelin had the audacity to tell him she had come back for him. BULLSHIT.She‚Äôd kill whoever was needed, whore herself, wreck herself, if it meant getting Aedion to safety.Remember when Celaena said to Dorian""I\'ll come back for you""? Yeah, me neither.Chaol Westfall deserved better than to be destroyed so I ship could happen.The author kept using the Nehemia card to make him look bad. Aelin blamed him for everything--leaving Dorian, having a part in Nehemia\'s death, working for the King of Adarlan and never killing him. But when he replied,‚ÄúYou do not get to blame me for that. For his actions.‚ÄùBut you do get to blame him for things that were out of his control, Aelin? Where\'s the damn logic.Chaol had run. He‚Äôd run, and Dorian had been left to been slaved by the collar.If he had stayed he would have been killed by now, and who would be trying to save Dorian? You? YOU, Aelin?! I thought so.And just to make it even more clear,You should have gotten Dorian and Sorscha out the day the king butchered those slaves.Did you learn nothing from Nehemia‚Äôs death?Did you somehow think you could win with your honor intact, without sacrificing something? You shouldn‚Äôt have left him; how could you let him face the king alone? How could you, how could you, how could you?Chaol had to endured this throughout the entire book. Damn, the entire series!He got the worst part. If I recall,Celaena never tried to kill the King, and she worked for him too.So, she\'s a freaking hypocrite for throwing those accusations to Chaol. SJM made Chaol feel sorry for himself, she made him see himself as a fool for trusting an assassing when HE GOT OVER IT A LONG TIME AGO!!No, Celaena Sardothien certainly did not exist anymore.That woman‚Äîthe woman he had loved... Perhaps she‚Äôd drowned in the vast, ruthless sea between here and Wendlyn. Perhaps she‚Äôd died at the hands of the Valg princes.Or maybe he‚Äôd been a fool all this time, a fool to look at the lives she‚Äôd taken and blood she‚Äôd so irreverently spilled, and not be disgusted.I see what you\'re trying to do, SJMAAS. But I\'m no fool. I SEE U, VILLAIN.Chaol Westfall deserves better 2k15#CHAOLWESTFALLDEFENSESQUADI WILL ALWAYS SHIP CHAOLAENA.It\'s over. They\'re not endgame according to this damn book. But I still have my copy ofCrown of Midnightthat proves otherwise. SJMAAS changed her mind. She wroteCrown of Midnightwith an idea, and she changed it the moment Rowan showed up.Nesryn Falig was obviously used as a plot device.It seems like SJMAAS didn\'t want Chaol to end up alone.I can\'t buy anything written in this book.Chaol Westfall would blush whenever he saw the girls who used to wait for him at his morning runs. He was dedicated to his Prince and King, and yet the author created this poor excuse of him having a relationship with Nesryn Faliq even beforeThrone of Glassso he wouldn\'t mind seeing Aelin and Rowan together. THAT WAS PATHETIC.A faint sort of amusement shone in her dark eyes. The same sort of amusement that had been there last year whenever they would meet, at inns or in rooms above taverns or sometimes even up against the wall of an alley.Ok that sounds fake but ok.I think what bothers me most about QoS is thatthe sort of closure Celaena and Chaol had inHeir of Firewas thrown to the trash can.I was fine with them not being together anymore, but what they both did in this book felt completely out of place. They acted like kids--SJMAAS pitted them against each other. Reading it was like watching a dummy relationships reality show. And they not having feelings for each other?? I get it, they are over. But when Chaol got hurt Aelin didn\'t even look at him! And Chaol never cared about Rowan, either. (Actually, Chaol seemed startled by Rowan\'s beauty, just like everyone else who came across him.)Their past was was erased. Like it never happened.‚ÄúIt meant something to me. What you and I had. More than that, your friendship meant something to me. I never told you the truth about who I was because I couldn‚Äôt face that truth.I‚Äôm sorry if what I said to you on the docks that day‚Äîthat I‚Äôd pick you‚Äîmade you think I‚Äôd come back, and it would all be fixed.Things changed. I changed.‚Äù@ Sarah J. Maas, WAS THIS FUCKING NECESSARY?!!!!There was so little left of the guard she‚Äôd come to care for....Youchanged, not him.You remind me of what the world ought to be; what the world can be, she‚Äôd once said to Chaol. Her face burned. A girl had said those things; a girl so desperate to survive, to make it through each day, that\tshe hadn‚Äôt questioned why he served the true monster of their world.WHY ARE YOU LYING. STOP FUCKING LYING, WOMAN. STOP. LYING.Yes, she‚Äôd loved Sam‚Äîmore than she‚Äôd ever loved anyone. Even Chaol.BITCH DON\'T MAKE ME SLAP YOU WITH MY COPY OF CoM.This part, though.Do you understand what it was like for us here? While you were off playing with magic, off gallivanting with your faerie prince, do you understand what happened to me‚Äîto Dorian?WHERE\'S THE LIE.#ChaolspeaksthetruthRowan/Aelin should have stayed platonic.InHeir of Firethey repeatedly told us that there was absolutely nothing romantic in their relationship, but in this book they acted like lovers in a erotic novel. It was pathetic.Rowan treated Celaena like hell in the previous book: he told her she was useless, that she would be better off dead; but nowthey\'re so suddenly in lovewith each other and it\'s all over their heads.And I wonder how they went from friends to lovers in such a small amount of time.Aelin would wear a dress with nothing underneath, and Rowan would take it as a huge turn on. She would freak out thinking too much about her incredibly handsome male partner that I wanted to punch my head against a wall.Several times.Their relationship is not healthy at all,SHE LITERALLY OWNS HIM.And every five seconds Aelin would come up with things like this:A chill fog had blanketed the world the night before, seeping in through every nook and cranny. Nestled under layers of quilts and down blankets,Aelin rolled over in bed and stretched a hand across the mattress, reaching lazily for the warm male body beside hers.I just hope it\'s a dead body.#sorrynotsorryAfter all that she had endured, after what she had overcome in Wendlyn, to return to this... She wished Rowan were beside her, wished she could smell his pine-and-snow scent and know that no matter what news Arobynn bore,no matter how it shattered her, the Fae warrior would be there to help put the pieces back together.That sounds like the typical""fix me, I\'m broken""plot we find in every NA book.I know Rowan is hot and has amazing fighting skills and his body\'s been formed by centuries of war and blah blah blah, but he acted like he was a member of Jersey Shore.Everything was an excuse for him to be shirtless.And the way he and Aedion acted around Aelin WAS THE MOST PATHETIC THING I\'VE EVER SEEN. It was like watching a pissing contest.Guys, Celaena made it through three damn books without you. I\'m pretty sure Aelin can take care of herself.BACK THE FUCK OFF.Everybody loved Aelin Galathynius.She was beautiful, she was sexy, she was lethal. Rowan and Aedion would fight over her. Arobynn would send her expensive gowns and perfumes. And she was definitely enjoying the attention.Celaena was arrogant, but Aelin reached a whole new level.She did not need the extra strength, speed, and agility of her Fae form to bring down her enemies.Whatever helps you sleep at night, honey.One of the few good things about this book was Dorian and Chaol\'s friendship (BrOTP af).At this point they\'re all I care about. I wouldn\'t mind if they get together and get married and have babies. They\'re the only two characters I dare save from this mess. Don\'t fight me on this.Everything‚Äîeverything was for Dorian, for his friend. For himself, he had nothing left to lose. He was nothing more than a nameless oath-breaker, a liar, a traitor.I love how loyal to Dorian Chaol is. I love how he fought Aelin just to save his Prince. His King. I love how he always believed there was a chance to save him. But I wish they had had a moment at the end of the book, because that is what they deserved.Chaol left with Nesryn, and now Dorian is unprotected again. It just feels off.I would like to talk about Arobynn Hamel, because I thought of him as such a rich and interesting character.I hate that he was lowered to the point of being just another crazy fan of Aelin.In the short novels we got to see a bit about his creepy obsession with Celaena and how far he would go to have her. I believe his characterhad more things to offerthan just that. I was looking forward to reading the epic battle between the Greatest Assassin in Adarlan and the man who trained her, but that didn\'t happen. Arobynn was a huge threat, and killing him off so soon--without getting his potential to its fullest--was a pretty ugly decision, if you ask me. And what a way to kill the Assassin\'s King: while he\'s asleep, by Lysandra.Really, Sarah?! REALLY?!The King was another disappointment.The biggest villain, a monster, the man who had erased magic from the Kingdom.... asking for mercy. The whole being-possessed-by-a-demon plot would have worked out pretty well if only had been thought throught. Why? Because we barely got the King\'s pov. If you want me to believe he had been struggling with a dark force within him, you must let me know him first--dude, we didn\'t even know his freaking name!--otherwise I don\'t care about what happens to him at all.Having Lysandra, The King and Arobynn\'s POV\'s in the previous books would have made things a lot interesting and added more depth to the plot.But the author just included them in this book, and honestlythey felt more like mere excuses and subplots.And can we talk about these ridiculously long speeches?Manon Blackbeak, heir of the Blackbeak Witch-Clan, bearer of the blade Wind-Cleaver, rider of the wyvern Abraxos, and Wing Leader of the King of Adarlan‚Äôs aerial host, stared at the portly man sitting across the black glass table and kept her temper on a tight leash.She was fire, and light, and ash, and embers. She was Aelin\tFireheart, and\tshe bowed for no one and nothing, save the crown that was hers by blood and survival and triumph.Stop acting like you\'re both Daenerys Targaryen.If you go into my profile, you\'ll see that Sarah J. Maas has been removed from my list of favorite authors. I cannot believe in the poor excuses she made. Arobynn Hamel getting killed so easily even thoughNo one‚Äînot even the King of Adarlan‚Äîwould be stupid enough to go after him(actual quote); The King of Adarlan being posessed by a demon all this time; Lysandra and Aelin suddenly being BFFs and sharing everything; Lysandra being a shape-shifter (how fucking convenient)... And Manon, I couldn\'t bring myself to care about this precious character. At All. I got some serious Manon/Dorian vibes, so I guess in the next book there\'ll be another romantic subplot. The King and his son had such an interesting plot, but sadly Aelin and Rowan\'s adventures were more important for the sake of the plot.SJMAAS lost me when she decided that Aelin would be ok with killing Dorian.So this is it.The most difficult part is that I now should seeCrown of Midnightas an standalone, because that book is a contradiction to everything I just read fromQueen of Shadows. A fanfic of her own series is what SJM wrote, and it pains me to see how my favorite characters were sacrificed over stupid subplots. It all ended in the second book, I\'m afraid. Well--it was good while it lasted, because I already gave up on these books._______________________________________________________Queen of Shadows, a summary:Aelin:Celaena Sardothien is dead, I\'m in charge now, and I\'ll burn everyone who dare say otherwise.Chaol:but WHAT ABOUT DORIANAelin:You left him!!

That I enjoyed the light, fluffyThrone of Glass. That I absolutely lovedCrown of Midnight. ThatHeir of Firewas a slow, plodding disappointment.Did I likeQueen of Shadowsmore than its predecessor?Yes.Do I think it\'s a fantastic book?No.Do I think you should read it? Well, it depends. It depends on whether you are committed enough to this series and these characters to read650 pages of just okay.This book is loooonnnng. I think - objectively - Maas has grown as a writer with every book, developing a complexity and density to her plot that wasn\'t there in the beginning. But I also think that a lot of the delicious goodness that made me sprint through pages in the first two books has been sucked out.Like other much-loved fantasy greats, her books have become more layered, with other characters, perspectives and side stories existing alongside Aelin/Celaena\'s story. Though, I personally don\'t care for many of these characters and I have to force myself not to skim-read through their chapters to get back to the main story.And, to be honest, a whole lot of this huge book (about two thirds) feels like set-up for what is going to happen. Which might be fine until you consider that it is 650 pages long (and really didn\'t need to be), which means there are about 400 pages of planning, angsting, conversation andobsessing over Aelin.Because that is really starting to get to me. We\'re about 2000 pages into this series and I honestly don\'t think I can take any more about how amazing Aelin/Celaena is. Everyone is in love with her. Everyone is in awe of her and her endless ability to do no wrong. Rowan sees her again and has to spend half a page going on about how stunning she is.And the badass speeches that are getting kind of old:She was fire, and light, and ash, and embers. She was Aelin Fireheart, and she bowed for no one and nothing, save the crown that was hers by blood and survival and triumph.The first one or two times this happened, I thought ""Hell yeah!"" but now I\'m just like ""Yeah, okay, I get it. She\'s freaking amazing.""My favourite thing about this book is Lysandra. Both what Maas has done with her characterization and the way she has developed the complex female friendship between her and Aelin.That was fantastic. But the romantic relationships have also turned sour, for me. My Chaol ship appears to have sunk and I find beautiful Rowan so boring - I have no interest in his relationship with Celaena or how good he is with his tongue.I will read on because I\'m too invested in this series to not know what happens, but I am resigned to the very likely probability that this series peaked atCrown of Midnight.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube|Pinterest'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Hey!

See you back here in a bit, I'll post the link when it's up!Initial reaction:I stayed up all night reading this, and these are the only coherent things I can say at this point:1. The women in this series are PHENOMENAL. Holy hell, I swear fealty to them until the end of my days.2. The new characters are fantastic! There is such complexity and poignancy in each of their stories, and I loved every single one of them, as well as what Aelin's interactions with them showed about her character.3. More descriptions of sleeping under a wyvern's wing, please. <34. I have issues with the way a couple of things are handled--most strongly and specifically, how poor Chaol is almost unrecognizable for most of this book. Even though I can accept misunderstandings, mistakes, differences of opinion, cross-purposes, and so on, it makes me so sad that his story arc seemed to be so diminished and dishonored.5. But the thing I didn't think I could be talked into, I'm actually totally on board with. I get why people might be upset byRowan and Aelin getting together, and maybe if there hadn't been so much previous back and forth with Dorian and Chaol, and if Chaol hadn't pretty much disavowed Aelin through most of this book, the new relationship would've been more palatable, but I'm pretty happy with the way the way the big change develops and is described in and of itself.6. This book also made me cry. Like gasping sobs in the middle of the night that I had to stifle so I wouldn't wake my husband. I teared up at several points, but the graveyard scene was the one where I just lost it.Sam still hurts my heart, so I was unbearably moved that his presence is so deeply felt in this book. I didn't expect it.*bawls all over again*7. Honestly,Dorian and Chaol should just get a room together.Also, the badass action scenes! Aelin! Her suit and weapons! The magic! MANON. And bathtub scenes, heeeey. More at some point when I'm not half-dead with lack of sleep.I went into this with a certain amount of dread, but much to my surprise, this is the book that has the happiest ending out of all of them.

And I mean it. Now, because I liked this one more than the rest of the other three I‚Äôve read, I have to give it six stars, right? Problem: I don‚Äôt have six stars so it is going to get the five and deal with it.This book is a whole journey. And I would love to take you to that journey with me, but I am not even sure that I will be able to hit all the best touristic attractions of it. I‚Äôll try though because it is worth it. Really.‚Äû(‚Ä¶) forgive a girl who had needed a captain to be her champion. But she was her own champion now.‚ÄùI just love this powerful mind-set Aelin has in this book. She‚Äôs more focused, more determined and more mature than she‚Äôs ever been. She empowers herself and others. She knows that. And she knows that she has to be confident in order to make others believe in her. To make them confident.There is also a wave of strength and empowerment among all the characters. This, in my opinion, shows a positive character change, a growth that is wanted, needed and achievable.‚ÄûI will keep getting back up, no matter how many times those butchers shove me down.‚ÄùAlso, apart from all this beautiful feeling of empowerment, there is a deep feeling ofloveandloyaltyin this book. And don‚Äôt tell me this type of feeling is not comforting and reassuring because I don‚Äôt believe you. Love is not only a singular thing; it can come in so many beautiful other ways and forms. And you know when you come across them. You sense them. And this book isfullof them.‚ÄûShe looked at them, at the three males who meant everything ‚Äì more than everything. Then she smiled with every last shred of courage, of desperation, of hope for the glimmer of that glorious future.‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go rattle the stars‚Äù ‚Äù .Aelin‚Äôs relationship with the other characters has developed a lot too. Giving the fact that she‚Äôs more mature and has a grown-up thinking now, her interactions with the other characters are changed in a remarkable way ‚Äì her old friends are still her old friends and she‚Äôs ready to give them her friendship in exchange for their loyalty. Her new acquaintances though are caught off guard by the way this young queen feels appropriate to act around them.All I‚Äôd really like everyone to notice in this book (and then I leave y‚Äôall alone) is the character growth I was talking about earlier (yeah, I know I‚Äôve repeated myself already but that is a very important track to follow throughout the book in order to notice its essence). And, I don‚Äôt know if this is coming from me or it is the whole idea of the book, but I think this character development is based on this level of love SJM has inserted in a fair amount. And the idea behind this is that everything that is made with love is becoming beautiful ‚Äì it is growing and it is blooming. And even the darkest souls might have a secret desire of love somewhere hidden, even though it is hard to reach.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'reading this book feels like an ascension to some higher sphere.this installment is the key turning point in this series and it has absolutely sent me. the foresight, the cleverness, the complexity, the reach, the drive, the cunningness - all of it amounts to a story that transcends all other stories.it is, quite simply, a masterpiece.‚Ü†5 stars'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '‚ÄùWhen you shatter the chains of this world and forge the next, remember that art is as vital as food to a kingdom.

To say it was better than its predecessors would probably be the understatement of the century so all I‚Äôll say is that Sarah once again surpassed herself. <3There were so many new characters that got introduced during the book and I‚Äôm not lying when I say that I loved them all. XD I think one of the most amazing things about Sarah‚Äôs books is that she has so many awesome and strong heroines! They do what they want to do, they are brave, they dare to dream, they dare to hope and they always make their way! It‚Äôs just so amazing to read! =)))Of course not everything in‚ÄúQueen of Shadows‚Äùis sunshine though and boy did it hit me with the feels sometimes! There were actually moments I was so frustrated that I felt like tearing the book apart (Don‚Äôt worry I did no such thing, I love my books too much to harm them. *lol*) and there were some chapters that killed me over and over again. I guess by now you all know which chapters I‚Äôm talking about. ;-)Well anyway, let‚Äôs not talk about the epic fights or the hopeful ending.WHAT a hopeful ending? YES!!!Jeez, I think this must be the first time I‚Äôm not destroyed after one of Sarah‚Äôs books. I‚Äôm actually h- ‚Ä¶ hopeful! I‚Äôm not licking my wounds or trying to deal with my emotions so knowing Sarah I have absolutely no doubt that she‚Äôs going to destroy me with‚ÄúEmpire of Storms‚Äù.Ladies and Gentleman, this is the quiet before the storm and I‚Äôm so not ready for it!

My character section is so full of spoilers you won‚Äôt even have to read the book anymore. ;-P So if you still want to read this series and want to experience it all by yourself you better stop reading now! Don‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt warn you! XDAelin:‚ÄùHow can I take away somebody who means the world to someone else? Even if she‚Äôs my enemy.‚ÄùBoy, did I have mixed feelings about Aelin in this book! On the one hand I really loved her and could understand her decisions, but on the other hand all I wanted to do was to yell at her! *lol* I mean she sometimes really didn‚Äôt make it easy to like her in this book, knowing about her past and everything she‚Äôs been through I could see through her fa√ßade though. I mean it‚Äôs obvious she struggled with her new role as Queen and because of her insecurities and fears she sometimes made mistakes that got her into trouble. A crown is a heavy weight; I don‚Äôt blame her for not being perfect. Hell, I‚Äôm pretty sure I would have made plenty of mistakes as well. XD‚ÄùBut now that she was here ‚Ä¶ everything was an effort not to say she was sorry. Sorry not for what she‚Äôd done to his face, but for the fact that her heart was healed ‚Äì still fractured in spots, but healed ‚Äì and he ‚Ä¶ he was not in it. Not as he‚Äôd once been.‚ÄùChaol:‚ÄùMagic has saved your life a few times now, if I recall correctly.‚Äù‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he breathed, ‚Äúyou and Dorian both ‚Äì and I‚Äôm grateful, I am. But where are the checks against your kind? Iron? Not much of a deterrent, is it? Once magic is free, who is to stop the monsters from coming out again? Who is to stop you?‚ÄùAnd here is my second problem child! Chaol! Jeez, he said quite some nasty stuff! I mean I know where he‚Äôs coming from and I understand that he worries for his people and kingdom; I‚Äôm not okay with what he said about magic though. Before you go all like: ‚ÄúOh don‚Äôt you dare to say anything against my baby!‚Äù now *raises eyebrow and looks at Gem and J.* I‚Äôll tell you that despite all this I actually still love him. *lol* He did the best he could do and he‚Äôs just human. Of course he is afraid of magic and what it might do to his kingdom. I mean in spite of being the former captain of the king‚Äôs guard he‚Äôs still young. I‚Äôm sure he can‚Äôt even remember the world with magic and it‚Äôs no surprise he‚Äôs afraid of it. If he proved anything over those last 4 books then it is that he‚Äôs able to learn and to change though. So yes, I have faith in him and I‚Äôm sure as long as he follows his heart, he‚Äôll always do the right thing. Plus:WHY DID YOU HAVE TO HURT HIM LIKE THAT, SARAH?!I think Chaol suffered enough over those last few books and now this too?! Not fair. T_TDorian:‚ÄùHe deserved this darkness, and once the invisible boundary shattered and the waiting thing pounced, infiltrating and filling him ‚Ä¶ he‚Äôd have earned it.‚ÄùMY PRECIOUS CINNAMON ROLL!!!*sobs* Gosh, how much did I suffer with him, how much did I weep for his shattered and broken soul. The pain he went through, the torture he had to endure. T_T Every chapter was another stab into my heart and by the end of the book I almost lost hope that he‚Äôd be free again. I thought he was going to die, that nothing would be left of him, but then, then he broke his chains and OMG did I cry when he finally escaped!!! Still, he‚Äôs so broken and lonely and I‚Äôm not sure how he‚Äôs going to deal with everything that happened to him. I‚Äôm so worried about Dorian and I really hope he‚Äôll be able to find happiness!#TeamDorian forever and for always!!! <333‚ÄùThere were tears running down Aelin‚Äôs face as Dorian gripped the black stone encircling his throat. And bellowing his grief, his rage, his pain, he snapped the collar from his neck.‚Äù‚ÄùThe sun would still rise and fall, the seasons would still change, heedless of whether he was free or enslaved, prince or king, heedless of who was alive and who was gone. The world would keep moving on.

My sexy relentless, fierce and ruthless witch! I love her! She‚Äôs one of those characters I can‚Äôt help but adore! I know she isn‚Äôt really a heroine, but she certainly is no villain either. In fact she‚Äôs such a complex character that I just can‚Äôt get enough of her!I FREAKIN LOVE THIS WITCH!And I‚Äôm so damn glad she finally decided to do whatSHEthinks is right! YESH!!! Screw that old hag of a matron and do your thing Manon! Because you‚Äôre amazing and you could be so much more than just the monster others see in you! It‚Äôs time to disobey orders and to kick asses! Show them your iron fangs, baby! XD #GuessImTeamManonNowTooAsterin let out another joyless laugh. ‚ÄúYou would not have disobeyed even if it had been Blackbeaks down there, would you? Loyalty, obedience, brutality ‚Äì that is what you are.‚Äù‚ÄùDo you believe monsters are born, or made?‚ÄùRowan:‚ÄùYou will make mistakes. You will make decisions, and sometimes you will regret those choices. Sometimes there won‚Äôt be a right choice, just the best of several bad options. I don‚Äôt need to tell you that you can do this ‚Äì you know you can. I wouldn‚Äôt have sworn the oath to you if I didn‚Äôt think you could.‚ÄùI like Rowan but despite him becoming the main love interest for Aelin I still don‚Äôt love him as much as I love Dorian or Aedion. Hmm.. I dunno what it is but I think I‚Äôm kind of unhappy with his development. I mean in ‚ÄúHeir of Fire‚Äù he was this kickass, broody and fierce warrior that took no shit and now he‚Äôs almost become a purring kitty in Aelin‚Äôs arms. I mean I do get that he loves Aelin and would do everything for her, but I think his love for her made him less interesting somehow? Idk. It‚Äôs like he lost some part of himself now that he fell in love with his Queen and I really hope we‚Äôll see the fierce warrior in ‚ÄúEmpire of Storms‚Äù again. Please?Aedion:‚ÄùWhatever you had to do to survive, whatever you did from spite or rage or selfishness ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt give a damn. You‚Äôre here ‚Äì and you‚Äôre perfect. You always were, and you always will be.‚ÄùAEDION IS MY CUPCAKE!Seriously I think he‚Äôs one of the cutest guys ever and he definitely deserves the world! I love how fiercely loyal he is and that he always tries to see the good in people. He never wavered and he always did the right thing, even if it hurt him and was at his own expense. Like for instance accepting that Aelin let Rowan take the oath and didn‚Äôt even mention it! Gosh darn it! Aedion deserved better than that! I‚Äôll personally pull Aelin‚Äôs long fae ears if she ever hurts him like that again!! Also is Aedion bi? I mean he commented on Rowan being handsome so I think that actually might be a possibility! Just one more reason to love him! <333Lysandra:‚ÄúNo. And what kills me is that I can‚Äôt remember what my real face was. That was the danger of shifting ‚Äì that you would forget your real form, because it‚Äôs the memory of it that guides the shifting. I remember being plain as a dormouse, but ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt remember if my eyes were blue or gray or green; I can‚Äôt remember the shape of my nose or my chin. And it was a child‚Äôs body, too. I don‚Äôt know what I would look like now, as a woman.‚ÄùI‚Äôm in love with Lysandra too! *lol* Yes, I can‚Äôt help it! She‚Äôs such an awesome woman as well and she‚Äôs a hell of a fighter! Gosh did I love her comments! That girl brought so much life into Aelin‚Äôs court and I lived for her remarks. She always tried to appear nonchalant and bitchy but deep down within her there‚Äôs a heart of gold and by the end of the book even Aelin was able to see it. To think they were enemies and rivals once... I‚Äôm so glad they finally became friends. Plus: How cool is it that Lysandra is a shape shifter?!! I mean OMG!!! I didn‚Äôt expect that and I was so surprised when I found out. XD‚ÄùThe soldiers in the sewer were screaming as she tore into them ‚Äì a death for every day in hell, a death for the childhood taken from her and from Evangeline. She was fury, she was wrath, she was vengeance.‚ÄùElide & Nesryn:‚ÄùYou told me Dorian would fix the world, make it better. Buf if he‚Äôs gone, if we made the mistake today in keeping him alive, then I will find another way to attain that future. And another one after that, if I have to. I will keep getting back up, no matter how many times those butchers shove me down.‚Äù- NesrynThose two were both strong women in their own way, but I feel like we didn‚Äôt get to see all too much of them. I just wish there would have been more scenes with Elide & Nesryn. I mean they both intrigued me and their characters sounded very interesting, in the end I don‚Äôt feel like I really got to know them though. *sigh* Well, there are so many characters in Sarah‚Äôs books, it‚Äôs no wonder some of them fall by the wayside. Let‚Äôs hope there will be more of them in Eos! ;-)Arobynn:‚ÄùSam had been tortured in ways she hadn‚Äôt even known until she read Wesley‚Äôs letter. The worst of it had been requested by Arobynn. Requested, as punishment for Sam‚Äôs loving her ‚Äì punishment for tampering with Arobynn‚Äôs belongings.‚ÄùThat manipulative jerk eventually got what he deserved! But damn I wish it wouldn‚Äôt have happened the way it did in the end. To die in his sleep was a death too merciful for him. For all the horrible and atrocious things Arobynn did he should have at least been awake and aware of the fact that he died. I understand why Lysandra could only kill him in his sleep though. *sigh* My poor brave girl!The friendships & ships:Aelin & Chaol:For a heartbeat, she pitied him, and part of her wished she could say it more kindly, more compassionately. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no getting Dorian out. There‚Äôs no saving him.‚Äù‚ÄúLike hell there isn‚Äôt.‚ÄùTHOSE TWO!Gosh, they constantly seemed to be at each other‚Äôs throat and they frustrated me immensely! I hated that Aelin thought she couldn‚Äôt save Dorian and loved Chaol for never giving up on him, yet at the same time I disliked Chaol for calling Aelin a monster! I swear their anger and the way they treated each other had me all like:No, NO, NO! You‚Äôre supposed to help each other!! You‚Äôre supposed to save Dorian! Pull yourself together and work it out! GODDAMMIT!!!Thankfully by the end of the book both of them finally realized that they need each other and they eventually made amends. Jeez! It was about time! *sighs deeply* Urgh they were so stressful.‚ÄùWe do not look back, Chaol. It helps no one and nothing to look back. We can only go on.‚ÄùThere she was, that queen looking out at him, a hint of the ruler she was becoming. And it knocked the breath out of him, because it made him feel so strangely young ‚Äì when she now seemed so old.Rowan & Aelin:‚ÄùI could still probably braid this,‚Äù she mused. ‚ÄúVery teensy-tiny braids, so ‚Äì ‚Äú He growled, but leaned back against the tub, his eyes closed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre no better than a house cat,‚Äù she said, massaging his head. He let out a low noise in his throat that might very well have been a purr.Haha! I loved it when Rowan lost all common sense at seeing Aelin in a flimsy nightgown! *LOL* Such a mighty fae warrior and then he sees her like that and isn‚Äôt even capable to utter a single word. XD Fun times. ;-P Still, I really like their connection and that they are so close to each other, I kind of dislike the notion of Rowan disappearing as an individual though. I just hope that he‚Äôll give her hell in ‚ÄúEoS‚Äù again. *lol* Because I lived for their easy banter and the fact that they always gave each other a run for their money! XD It would be boring if Rowan would end up as nothing more than the man at Aelin‚Äôs side.‚ÄùI spent centuries wandering the world, from empires to kingdoms to wastelands, never settling, never stopping ‚Äì not for one moment. I was always looking toward the horizon, always wondering what waited across the next ocean, over the next mountain. But I think ‚Ä¶ I think that whole time, all those centuries, I was just looking for you.‚ÄùManon & Dorian:He cocked his head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been with a witch.‚ÄùLet her rip out his throat for that. End it.A row of iron fangs snapped down over her teeth as her smile grew. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been with plenty of men. You‚Äôre all the same. Taste the same.‚Äù She looked him over as if he were her next meal.‚ÄúI dare you,‚Äù he managed to say.Her eyes narrowed, the gold like living embers. He‚Äôd never seen anyone so beautiful. This witch had been crafted from the darkness between the stars.I SHIP THEM SO HARD I CAN‚ÄôT EVEN!!!! ADKFADSFASDJFKSDFJA!I love it that Manon was the only one who got that Dorian is still alive and I love that she was so drawn to him! And boy those two short conversations they had!THEY GAVE ME LIFE!!! I WANT MORE OF THEM!!Just more!! I want my fierce, ruthless witch and my precious cinnamon roll to be together!!! PLEASEEEEE!!!! *dies out of sheer excitement*‚ÄùAnd through the darkness of his memories, through the pain and despair and terror he‚Äôd tried to forget, a name echoed in his head.‚ÄùManon & Asterin:‚ÄùThat wildness, that untamed fierceness ‚Ä¶ They weren‚Äôt born of a free heart, but of one that had known despair so complete that living brightly, living violently, was the only way to outrun it.‚ÄùAsterin‚Äôs story broke my heart and I want her to be happy again!!! I hated it so much that they both were at odds with each other and that Asterin had to suffer so much even though she only wanted to help Manon. She loves her. It‚Äôs more than just obvious! As it seems Manon had to come a long way until she realized what truly matters, but I think now that she did, she‚Äôs finally ready to oppose her matron! I really can‚Äôt wait to seeTHATfight! XD‚ÄùThings are changing,‚Äù Manon said.‚ÄúGood,‚Äù Asterin said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre immortals. Things should change, and often, or they‚Äôll get boring.‚ÄùManon lifted her brows, and her Second grinnend. Manon shook her head and grinned back.Lysandra & Aedion:A strange, ever-changing female scent hit him, and Aedion found Lysandra leaning against the hallway door. Tears gleamed in her eyes even as she smiled.She gazed at the closed bedroom door, as if she could still see the prince and queen inside. ‚ÄúThat,‚Äù she said, more to herself than to him. ‚ÄúThat is what I am going to find one day.‚Äù‚ÄúA gorgeous Fae warrior?‚Äù Aedion said, shifting a bit.Lysandra chuckled, wiping away her tears, and gave him a knowing look before walking away.Another ship I want to sail! I think Aedion and Lysandra would make such a great couple! *lol* Besides I‚Äôm sure Lysandra might actually be the only one who would be able to keep up with Aedion. Haha! I mean they tease each other so nicely and Aedion is even slightly unsettled when she‚Äôs turning into a ghost leopard which means he has a lot of respect for her and this is always important in a relationship! =) Let‚Äôs see if Aedion will be Lysandra‚Äôs gorgeous Fae warrior in ‚Äò‚ÄùEos‚Äù! ;-PAelin & Dorian:‚ÄùIt is going to take a while. And it might never be right again. Buy you ‚Ä¶‚Äù She gripped his hand, as if he hadn‚Äôt used those hands to hurt and maim, to stab her. ‚ÄúYou will learn to face it, and to endure it. What happened, Dorian, was not your fault.‚ÄùI still love their strong friendship, despite Aelin being willing to kill him of course. XD But I guess after meeting those Valg Princes at Wendlyn she was allowed to doubt his survival. Still, they both can change the world together and they are both so strong! I have faith in them and I‚Äôm sure if they help each other and stick together they can really shatter the chains of their world and make it right! =)Dorian & Chaol:‚ÄùI didn‚Äôt realize I looked that bad,‚Äù Dorian said, his voice raw.He knew then ‚Äì that the demon inside the prince was gone. Chaol wept.Dorian surged from the chair and dropped to his knees beside the bed. He grabbed Chaol‚Äôs hand, squeezing it as he pressed his brow against his. ‚ÄúYou were dead,‚Äù the prince said, his voice breaking. ‚ÄúI thought you were dead.‚ÄùThose two had me in tears at the end. T_T I was so happy they both found each other again!!! Their friendship went through so much in those last four books and now they are finally together! I love them and I admit it, I even kinda ship them. XD I mean hello, Chaol told Dorian that heloveshim! XD Can‚Äôt blame me for shipping them, can you?! ;-P Besides, it‚Äôs obvious they love each other. At least as friends they do. XDAll told I really loved‚ÄúQueen of Shadows‚Äùand I can‚Äôt wait to get to book five! I‚Äôm sure Sarah will have a lot in store for us and I‚Äôm kinda scared to start it. As long as myprecious Gemcontinues this journey with me I shall be fine though! ;-P Thanks for reading this series with me! XD We just have to read two more books!!!

Let‚Äôs think of an alternative title for it‚Ä¶ how about‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶""HOW TO RUIN A CHARACTER AND HIS DEVELOPMENT THROUGH 3 MOTHERFUCKING BOOKS IN ONE BOOK"". Yep, that fits perfectly!This is not a proper review, it‚Äôs more of an incomprehensible rant with a lot of cursing.Those who saw my updates already know how torn I am about this book. It‚Äôs still so difficult for me to form an opinion, because this book was such a mix of an amazing plot-line and ass-kicking and just real bullshit.About the amazing plot-line, well, Sarah J. Maas comes up with the most mind-blowing plot-twists. The ass-kicking: well-choreographed fights and Aelin‚Äôs plans were just brilliant. And I love Sarah‚Äôs writing style, it kicks me right in the feels every damn time.Now, so far it sounds pretty good, right? You may ask, why the 2-stars-rating then?There‚Äôs one thing that ruined everything.The Chaol thing.First you have to know that I love Chaol with all my heart.#chaoldefensesquadFrom book one he was my favourite character and his development through the first three books just blew me away. He is definitely flawed, but who is not.So the way Sarah handled his character in QOS just broke my heart. She destroyed all his development in 60 pages. That‚Äôs right, she threw away all the work she put into him in less than 9% of the book.This just felt like such a slap in the face. The way she wrote Chaol in the first 70% was so out of character. It wasn‚Äôt even Chaol anymore, the Chaol I know and read about would never act the way he did.You may say that he‚Äôs Sarah‚Äôs character, she wrote him and probably knows him the best. Do I have any right to say he was out of characters? Maybe not. But I was madly obsessed with him from the start, over-analysed every word he said and action he made. I dare to say that I know him enough to say that QOS Chaol was just bullshit.Do I sound like a child throwing a tantrum? Maybe. But you know what? I. Don‚Äôt. Care.How could someone put so much effort into developing a character, and then just destroy him and waste all the potential?It makes no fucking sense. It‚Äôs stupid. So stupid.But there is an explanation, well, my explanation.Rowan.I already knew about Sarah‚Äôs obsession with Rowan; every interview I watched she ended up speaking about him and how hot he is. So often she didn‚Äôt even mention the other characters.I‚Äôm not complaining, he definitely is an interesting character and I like him.But when an author rewrites a character (Chaol) just to benefit another one (Rowan), I can‚Äôt help but feel betrayed.It was like the first two books didn‚Äôt even happen to Chaol, we started from zero again. And I‚Äôm just so angry.When the conversation at page 60 happened I just broke down and cried. I couldn‚Äôt believe that this was happening. This was not Chaol, not the guy who was ready to give up everything he worked for and ever believed in to send the girl he loves away to keep her safe.This was just a twisted version of him and honestly, I can‚Äôt believe Sarah actually came up with this.I FUCKING TRUSTED YOU.Chaol deserves so much better.And the worst thing is, there is no way back from this. No way to fix it. While Sarah did kind of tried to in the end, I still can‚Äôt forget this whole bullshit she put me, us Chaol fan, through. She just stabbed us and let us bleeding for some hours, then came back and gave us a band-aid for the wound.THAT WON‚ÄôT FUCKING WORK.I‚Äôm also a Chaol/Aelin shipper. I‚Äôve been since the first couple of chapters of TOG, still am after QOS and will probably always be.But I knew since HOF that they will not be endgame. And I came to terms with it. I was ready for them to end romantically, but I wasn‚Äôt expecting this shit.Here then comes the second problem, Rowan and Nesryn.Don‚Äôt hit me, but I shipped Aelin/Rowan after HOF. They made sense to me. But the way Sarah handled their relationship in QOS just weirded me out.Rowan‚Äôs POVs were sometimes‚Ä¶ dumb. I can‚Äôt find the right word for it, but they made me roll my eyes so often. I still like him, but not as much as I did in HOF.I also didn‚Äôt like how fast their relationship progressed. Because in HOF they were just friends, it was one of my favourite platonic relationships, and then in QOS they went from 0 to 100. It was just too fast and kind of weird.Then Nesryn. Oh, how much I actually love her. She‚Äôs such a strong and amazing character. But the way she was introduced ruined it all. It was as if she was just there so Chaol would have someoneyes, she‚Äôs his new love interest.kill meto talk to. She didn\'t seem like a character who was planned from the start, but just thrown in when Sarah\'s startedruiningrewriting Chaol.There\'s something really wrong about how Sarah just cast him aside for Rowan. It\'s rude as fuck. It ruined the whole book for me, I couldn\'t enjoy the first 60% because of it. I mean, how could I, hewasis my favourite character.But there were definitely some parts I still loved about the book.a)Manon. Oh my god guys, her chapters were pure awesomeness. Sometimes they were way more interesting than Aelin\'s. Her plot-line in this book is just so captivating and I fell in love with her.b)Elide. Damn, her chapters kind of broke my heart but I admire her so much. I don\'t know about you but I love her so much.c)Dorian. My baby. I\'m so scared for you. His chapters were so twisted and dark, but I couldn\'t help but enjoy them.d)Lysandra. Such a cutie. I loved her relationship with Aelin. BROTP FOREVER.Here\'s the end of my rant. There are probably more things I wanted to talk about but can\'t think of right now.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'I am soimpressedwith this series.She was fire, and light, and ash, and embers. She was Aelin Fireheart, and she bowed for no one and nothing, save the crown that was hers by blood and survival and triumph.I honestly cannot remember the last time when aseries was so consistently good.It\'s the fourth book and yet the story and the characters feel as fresh as the first.Aelin Galathynius has returned and her life as Celaena Sardothien is a part of the past -or so she thought.

No words for this book. 95% love for this book, but the first 300 pages had issues I can\'t deny. But overall I just love love love how the plot developed!Full review:Check out my review @A Perfection Called Books**Spoilers from previous books. Slight QoS spoilers about romance.Throne of Glass has been one of my favorite series for a few years now, so I\'ve been impatiently waiting for Queen of Shadows and building the expectations to the highest degree. The fourth installment wowed me yet had some flaws I can\'t ignore.As much as I\'d like to blindly give myself over to the epicness of this series and say ""It was perfect, and everything was amazing"" I can\'t do that as a reviewer. Nor can I do that as a reader/person in general. I refuse to trick myself! Overall though, I have so many positive things to say about this book,and a few negative things to discuss.The PlotFirst let\'s start with the plot development. I bow down to Sarah J Maas and her brilliant plotting. I am astounded by all the ties and connections reaching so far back to The Assassin\'s Blade. There are lots of ah-ha and mind-blowing moments. Everything connects in some way, and Maas is a magnificent plotter. The pacing was a bit slow for the first 300 pages, but there\'s so much plot build-up and development that keeps us engaged. Maas\' writing has progressively matured into a beautiful story-telling talent. There\'s an ominous edge to it that perfectly matches the tone of the series. I feel this series is getting darker and darker; it\'s often pitched as a less promiscuous YA Game of Thrones. There are some bloody scenes, lots of death, and quite a bit of pain. Action is interspersed throughout the story too.The CharactersLet\'s talk about the characters! In Heir of Fire, I had a few issues with the various POV switches, but I thought the transitions were smoother in Queen of Shadows, and I actually like Manon and her story a bit more in this book. Elide is also introduced, and while her POV was my least favorite, her character is pretty tenacious and smart, so I can\'t wait to see where she goes next. Lysandra is re-introduced, and I love her sassy and snarky character. Nesyrn is a rebel who is part of the city guard. She\'s pretty stoic and strong-willed, and I like her! Aedion will always be a bright star with his unending devotion and loyalty to Aelin. Dorian\'s character and POVs were painful and sad to read. I love him and thought his tenacity and decisiveness were admirable.Squad assembled in this book, and I was so happy about that!! I love Aelin\'s court/group and seeing them all come together was definitely one of my favorite parts. Light banter and strong female friendships prevail, and I approve! Arobynn comes back into this novel and oh geez I forgot how cynical and ruthless he is. Sam has such a presence in this novel which was equal parts surprising, somber, and up-lifting.Let\'s talk about Rowan, Chaol, and Aelin. Such fun. While I loved all the other characters mentioned above, I had so much trouble with these three. Please don\'t stone me, but I\'m going to call BS and say these people were SO out of character for the first 300 pages. I liked Rowan a bit better in this book, but whoa has he changed. No longer is he the tight***, brutal and unemotional warrior. He\'s now reduced to a horny teenager who pines over Aelin. I failed to see many similarities between this Rowan and the one from HoF. Chaol, oh my sweet Chaol. Honorable Captain of the Guard, now disgraced and rebel-turned. His bitterness has reached his peak just as his character and his POV has been diminished. I still hold on to the hope he\'ll achieve redemption. Chaol has grown so much throughout this series, yet he still needs time to grow. He\'s used to his beliefs and blindly and honorably follows his king. Now that everything he knows and loves is being threatened and challenged, he\'s had to change, and not everyone reacts the same way to change. He\'s made progress!Aelin has turned malicious and bitter. I love how bad*** she is and how she fights for what she believes in, but I missed her sarcastic nature. I missed the girl who loved reading and dresses yet also loved to show people her girl power and how awesome she is. She lacked the confidence and humor I associate with her. Just because she and Celaena have different goals, I don\'t think that should mean her character takes a 180 turn. Most of all Aelin is highly hypocritical, especially towards Chaol. Aelin and Chaol are both mad at each other for both reasonable and unreasonable things. Personally I think they were both being hypocritical as they slung insults and accusations at each other at their first meeting in QoS. I see faults on both sides, but I think they\'ll work through it eventually.The RomanceSpeaking of Aelin and Chaol, you\'ve probably heard about the romance news. I\'ll be honest, this ship is sunk and blasted to smithereens. They want and need different things, and it would never work out. It twinges my heart and makes me wonder about the so-called significance of the words exchanged on Crown of Midnight. Some things literally do NOT make sense. Aelin even says something to the effect of ""Even though I said I\'d always pick you, I didn\'t mean I\'d actually always pick you."" I feel like books 1 and 2 were so insignificance and fake now in regards to the romance. I think it\'s fresh and unique to see how realistic the portrayal of falling into and out of love is, but it still hurts. I feel like we were led on in Crown of Midnight, and you can\'t deny all the words they said to each other.Jumping to the romance, I do not understand it nor will I get on board with it. I\'m not being a stubborn Chaolaena shipper (okay maybe a little bit), but I fail to see Rowaelin in the long run. Rowan is the type of guy Aelin needs right now. I just don\'t understand how things progressed from Heir of Fire as a platonic friendship to a lusty and yearning attachment in Queen of Shadows. I feel like I missed an extra novella or something. Rowan had his one true mate AND is three hundred years old. This romance does not compute. That being said, there actually isn\'t much romance in this book, it\'s more promises to come in the next book.As Cait from Paper Fury pointed out, there are so many conveniences in the romance department. Nesryn will take Celaena\'s place in Chaol\'s heart, so Aelin and Rowan can be happy together, and everything is all sparkly rainbows and wonderful now. I feel like this is such an easy way out. The Chaolin breakup was brutal, and I\'m sad to see how it wrecked their friendship too.The last 150 pages of the book are insanely epic and wonderful. The characters grow into their own a bit more as well.Overall the amazing plot, squad assemblage, and writing make this book wonderful while the romance and earlier portrayal of the characters sorely disappointed and confused me.Update 5/22/15Queen of Shadows is 672 pages long. *sinks in*OH MY GOSH I AM SO FREAKING EXCITED!!!!!!!!Update 3/10/14LOOK AT THIS BEAUTIFUL COVERAhhh, she\'s so badass!!

THIS BOOK. I'm so conflicted, I hated half of the things that happened but loved the other half! I was going to let myself give it 5 stars just for the AWESOME ending (overall the whole second part of the book was AMAZING), but the first part was unbearable! I believe it took me one week to finish it, while the second part I read it only in one day because OMGITWASSOAMAZING and I couldn't stop. BUT YES, the first part: BORING and ANNOYING. There are so many pages in this book and I don't feel they were necessary, also, I wanted to punch everyone.Another thing that I hated was what SJM did to my babies: CHAOL AND DORIAN. Especially to Chaol, he was so OoC most of the time! AND YES, I was a Chaolena shipper, (WAS, because that ship SUNK in this book and I'm so mad and sad and torn), but I wouldn't be as mad if SJM hadn't RUINED the character. She also ruined Chaolena's dynamics, she made them almost hate each other! At the end of the book everything is kinda better between them, but it will never be the same. So goodbye to my beautiful ship. Chaol didn't deserve what SJM did to him. And about Dorian... he wasn't in enough pages of this book. He was barely there (OH BUT AT THE END HE WAS SO AWESOME, I LOVE HIM SO MUCH).I'm not really fond of the whole Rowan/Aelin thing. I MEAN, I love Rowan, I really do! But what I liked about them was their friendship! It's really hard to find something like that in a YA book and I loved it, BUT THEN in this book they are suddenly all in love with each other, it doesn't make any sense! I can accept them together, I know I can, but SJM could have done a better job in making them fall in love with each other slowly, so WE the readers could notice the change! It was so abrupt! And I was so tired of hearing them saying how stunning and perfect the other was. Bleh. And tbh, they mostly wanted to undress each other in every scene they had together.SO... SHIPS I'M NOT ON BOARD:- Rowan/Aelin: I think they can convince me, but right now I'm a little icky towards them.- Chaol/Nesryn: I like Nesryn as a character, but SJM just put her in the book so Chaol could have a new couple, and it felt forced.MY NEW SHIPS:- Dorian/Manon: OOPS, am I the only one who ships them!? I mean, they surely can become a thing! The few encounters they had were some of the best parts of the book! And Dorian remembers her and FKDKDKGKGA. I don't wanna say much because SPOILERS, but yes, Dorian and Manon would be a powerful and really interesting couple.- Dorian/Chaol: YES I SHIP THEM. Can they get married, like, right now?And yeah... that's basically it. I just want to say that I absolutely LOVED the second part of the book. I couldn't stop reading! Dorian, Manon and Aelin are my heroes! GO, them!...EDIT: Just to add the thing I hate the most about this series! I absolutely HATE that EVERYONE IS SO IN LOVE WITH AELIN. Not just in this book, but in the WHOLE SERIES! Since book one! Sam, Chaol, Dorian, Arobynn, Aedeon, Rowan, even Lysandra... at some point of the series they have marveled at how stunning and beautiful and amazing Celaena/Aelin is, and I can't stand it! I mean, yeah she's awesome, I get it, but it's so unrealistic. Every male she befriends has to fall in love with her :/.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Everyone was off their rocker the first half of this book.

I just wish some changes were smoother.However, this book wasepic. Period. The different storylines were knit together perfectly, and the last 100 pages gave me goosebumps.

I loved how improved the third books was, but this fourth books was well beyond my wildest expectations. Plot, world building, character development, adventure, humor, politics, and anything else you could think of, each reaches a near perfect level in Queen of Shadows. As always, the first half build-up leads to a thrilling second half, that felt more like the final book of a series, than one of the middle installments. I\'m having a hard time imagining remaining ones surpassing this book: Maas does everything correctly here. If you\'re one of many who gave up on this series because of the first two books, you are missing out on an amazing journey.""Celaena Sardothien doesn\'t exist anymore.""While we still have most of the original gang, the author keeps on introducing new, interesting characters with each book. And the best thing is, all these new characters are turning out to be even better than the main ones. Manon and Rowan quickly replaced everyone else as my favorites by the end of this book, and I\'m really hoping Maas would not kill them off in near future. When she must have chaos -which would be inevitable in next three books- I\'m willing to loose one of the older main characters instead of those two. But I might be getting ahead of myself.Plot-wise, there\'s a lot happening here. Pretty much all the loose threads are tied up by the end of this book. If it wasn\'t for a couple of major bad guys remaining, it\'s easier to imagine this book turning out to be the end of the series. The last quarter was so eventful, and unpredictable, leading up to probably the best ending I\'ve encountered in this series so far. I\'m also finding those adventure elements to be quite enjoyable, adding a nice bit of variety to the usual flow with politics, scheming and romance.""Backs straight, shoulders back, necks uplifted. You are light you are air, you are grace.""It\'s not easy to give a \'right\' ending to a book like this. If everything goes perfectly, you end up making the ending unrealistic, or make things go very badly by killing some of the good guys, you end up depressing and disappointing a lot of readers. Even though the ending here was a little towards the former, I liked how things turned out at the end. It\'s really nice of Maas to maintain a perfect balance between victory and defeat without major causalities to the good guys. Though, it\'s possible that this might be the only happy ending we\'ll have for a while. 4.5 stars.

The books in this series just seem to get bigger and better. This book is 600 + pages, but every page is good and well done. My only complaint is that I would have like more details about the fights, more blow for blow account not that ""they were already carrion, when she drew her blades"". True, this would probably take the page count well into the 1000s, but I would not mind if it was well written as the rest of the book. I have always been a fan of Sarah J Maas\' ""chunking"" writing style, where she makes some chapters longer as events dictate in some cases half a page for a side event constitutes a chapter.The last book Celaena\'s true name and heritage was revealed in this book to reflect this she is referred to as Aelin rather than Celaena, the book also introduced a new character and Manon of the Iron Teeth witches. She and her coven are continued to be developed in this book. For this development and even by the end of the book, we are not sure which way she will turn. Many of the characters of the novellas or the collected counterpart Assassin\'s Blade paperback. The fallout from there is death within the first half of this book. The body count is higher in this book, but there are not as many fights described. What this book does display is Celaena/Aelin\'s tactical and planning precision yes she can be a hellcat and a hot head, but as wild as she get she is a disciplined and dangerous fighter always thinking a couple of moves ahead. There is a great cat and mouse game between Aelin and her former master.Aelin returns to Adarlan she finds it an even more brutal place than before. Along with her own vengeance, she must deal with the fallout from the months she has been missing, one disadvantage is all the training she did to hone her powers in the last book, is lost as magic does not work in Adarlan. However, her physical training is still useful and has made her even more formidable.

God, I love him in this book (If you\'ve read QOS you probably read that sentence and thought I was insane but I don\'t care). I absolutely loved reading from his point of view. The complete change from light to dark had me drawn in. He became such a stellar character in this novel. He is a true wild card at this point in time. Then there\'s Choal. I know people love Choal. That in the previous books everyone has been ""team Choal this"" ""team Choal that"", however if you know or have read any of my review for this series then you know I have not been team Choal---or even team Dorian. Choal does give us a ton of character development and growth in this book, and I love his character but he\'s still not one of my favorites in this series. Then we have a ""newer"" player, \n  Aedion\n... Love him. His sass, his loyalty, his personality shine so bright in this book. I just couldn\'t get enough of him. And the growing bromance between him and Rowan had me dying. This leads me too the two people I\'ve been dying ta get ta....Yes, Rowan and Celaena. I know that Celaena officially goes by Aelin in this book, but I\'m going to warn you now that I will probably always call her Celaena or ""C"". These two... OMG. THESE TWO KILL ME!!!!!!I haven\'t shipped a ship this hard in the longest and it has me all sorts of giddy.Again if you\'ve read my review in the past then you know whose team I\'ve always been on... Team Rowan. From the moment this man was introduced it was signed, sealed, delivered.I LOVE HIM!!!! Good gods I love him.Though we got a good deal of him inHOFit isn\'t even half of what we get out of him in this book. We get to see into his brain. We get to see how he is feeling, he\'s stages of thinking, and his feeling towards Celaena in a way we haven\'t been able to in the past. It has be swooning all over the place. Everything he does and says will win you over. He was already on myfavorite fictional guyslist but lets just say after reading this he has defeintely moved up on the list. I can\'t wait to see where their bond takes them.It\'s refreshing to have a character in this series that generally understands her struggles and the weight that has been put on her shoulders. Lastly we have Celaena.I have said it on many many occasions that Celaena is my all time favorite female character.Queen of Shadowsjust further justified this for me.She is one cunning, whip smart, silver tongued, bad-ass bitch.QOSby far gives the best description I\'ve ever heard of her...""A storm given flesh.""That sentence is so spot on it isn\'t even real. InQOSya girl is taking no prisoners. No seriously, If Celaena was in aGOThouse she would be a freaking Lannister... and yall know why... Because a Sardothien always pays her debts.I can\'t even count how many times I screamed ""OH MY GOD"" over something she did. At one point in time this was my goodreads status update...""Seriously????!!? Did C just drop the mic??? UH YEAH SHE DID!! Seriouslyjust screamed ""oooooooooooh damn"" and scared the crap out of my dog.She just such a badass""... Everything she does is so calculated that when you finally see all the pieces come together you\'ll be exploding.Your brain will have to take several cold showers to get over the mind rape she will do to you.If there was something you wanted from C that you didn\'t get in the past you\'ll get it in this one. She gives you a side of her we haven\'t seen. This raw real emotion that takes her character to a whole new level. Celaena\'s character in this novel had me bowing down to the real Queen that is Sarah J Maas. *Insert slow clap*. Bravo! Thank you for making a character that is the epitome of strong leading female. Yes Celanea might go a little stray cray here and there, but God... She might want a man but she doesn\'t need one. She can do bad all by herself. Sarah continued to show that you can be tough but still love the things you want. You can wield a sword but still love dresses. That you can be all these strong willed tough as nails things, but still love deep. There\'s no other word to describe Celanea\'s character besides amazing. As for the characters I couldn\'t mention, they truly hold their own in this book. One surprise after another. There is one certain witch in particular that I can\'t wait to see in the next book.I know I talked a lot about the characters and not so much about the plot. Again that is only because we are now four books deep people.QOSis the perfect balance of action packed scenes, romance, fighting, plotting, and build up. This is basically me the whole time... Page 1-170 I thank Maas for giving me everything back. Page 181 I die. Page 295 I freak the f out! Page 319 I cry my eyes out. Paged 320 I curl up in a ball and die again. 370 I realize that if my heart wasn\'t stolen by C before it\'s was officially taken. Page 400-656 I don\'t breathe and can\'t feel my body. I cry. I swoon. I die again and didn\'t even know that was physically possible. Swoon some more. Then do my final freak out. This is all without even mentioning the crazy plot twists that happen. They sneak up on you and tear your heart and eyes both out. Sometimes at the same time. And that ending, though a lot of lose ends are taken care of it still has me so conflicted. I just don\'t know where this story is headed. My heart is telling me it going to go one place while my head tells me to expect another.The whole ending plays out just like a movie. So vivid you can see and feel the whole thing. Just phenomenal.Queen of Shadowswas well worth the wait and hanging around till the next book comes out might just do me in. Don\'t even get me start on how we still get at least two more books! Sarah J. Maas continues to surprise me with a series I never even thought I would like, but has turned out to be one of my favorites.All in allQueen of Shadowsis about finding your place in the world. Consuming what you must and then fighting for what you love. That you yourself can be your best friend or your worst enemy. That it isn\'t about how heavy the weight is but about how long you hold it. That you get to choose your future. That your past might have built you but that it doesn\'t have to define you. That one person can truly rattle the stars.originally read September 2015.Re-read August 2016'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""‚Äúwhat if we go on,‚Äù he said ‚Äúonly to more pain and despair? what if we go on, only to find a horrible end waiting for us?‚Äù[she] looked northward, as if she could see all the way to terrasen. ‚Äúthen it is not the end.‚Äù4.75 stars.(please forgive me in advance for this subpar review that i am writing with COVID brain. i swear only a third of my brain cells are currently working.)i believe this is my favorite book of the series yet?! the progression of this entire story is so addicting and i only become more obsessed with these books the more that i read.i am so thankful for this author for teaching me to not be afraid of series or intimidated by long books.becoming a fantasy girly has been the best thing for me as a reader,as i have never loved characters so deeply before. being so immersed in a different world and so attached to every single character is a special kind of magic. ‚ú®escapism at its absolute finest.‚ú®this series continues to just get better to me as the story progresses. i love seeing the world, the characters, and the relationships evolve without being too dragged out. i've never had 600 page books feel so short before. sjm‚Äôs writing is one hell of a drug.admittedly, i have to say that i can now see why not everyone is a chaol girl‚Ä¶. i will not rescind my previous statements regarding chaol completely, but i can certainly understand everyone else now LOLspecial shoutout to my girl lysandra. i love her w my whole heart. rowan finally grew on me, too, and now my heart is tied up in too many characters and i feel like i‚Äôm going to get hurt.putting down any of these books to go back to living real life is always such a shame.onto the tandem read i go...she said softly, ‚Äúyou make me want to live‚Ä¶ not survive; not exist.live.‚Äù‚ù§Ô∏è(i‚Äôm not crying ‚Äì you‚Äôre crying)‚úº\u3000 “â \u3000‚úº\u3000 “â \u3000‚úº\u3000 “â \u3000‚úº\u3000 “â \u3000‚úº\u3000 “â \u3000‚úº\u3000 “â \u3000‚úº\u3000 “â \u3000‚úºall of my ToG reviews can be found here:1.the assassin‚Äôs blade2.throne of glass3.crown of midnight4.heir of fire5.queen of shadows6.empire of storms7.tower of dawn‚úº\u3000 “â \u3000‚úº\u3000 “â \u3000‚úº\u3000 “â \u3000‚úº\u3000 “â \u3000‚úº\u3000 “â \u3000‚úº\u3000 “â \u3000‚úº\u3000 “â \u3000‚úº""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'ÀóÀèÀã ‚òÖ ÀéÀäÀó ùìòùì∑ùìØùì≤ùì∑ùì≤ùìΩùîÇ ùì¢ùìΩùì™ùìªùìº!!

So, now,it\'s just so much harder to actually pick a favorite out of the series!The first time I read the series I flew through each book so fast! It seems I\'m doing that on the reread as well lol. The story is so amazing, so needless to say... after finishing Heir of Fire,I couldn\'t even take a moment to breathe let alone recover. I had to dive straight into Queen of Shadows.Everything about this book is PERFECT!The character growth, the story, the power, the vengeance. Chef\'s kiss! üíã I was an emotional mess throughout! The good times, and the bad I was a total sobbing mess!The overall experience of this book is mostly cathartic. As Celaena and Aedion both deal with their pasts and what their futures mean for Terrasen.Sarah J Maas has you cheering, crying, and feeling an entire range of emotions from the characters.The characters start to show real growth in this book, accepting things for what they are, changing behaviors, realizing how they can be better. It‚Äôs just a magnificent book filled with growth.In the books prior to this we\'re getting a few different point of views, as there are multiple things happening throughout Erilea.In this book, all of these different events start to blend together into one main story. I\'ve previously said that I believeCrown of Midnightis the turning point of the series, thatHeir of Fireis the game changer, well, now, I\'m saying thatQueen of Shadowsis not only the eye opening ahh ha moment but a pivotal point in the series as well.I love this series so much, I can\'t even take it! It\'s so well done. And to be frank, I can\'t even wrap my head around the fact that SJM wrote this when she was 16 years old! I mean, I can barley pull a review together some days lol.

Her hair was like living moonlight, her eyes like burnished gold..She was the most beautiful person Aelin had ever seen.And the most horrifying.She moved with a swagger that Aelin supposed only an immortal could achieve, her red cloak snapping behind her, the riding leathers clinging to her lithe body.

I HAVE NOT KNOWN LOVE UNTIL I MET THIS BOOK. I don't even know how to form a coherent review on this. So sorry in advance because this is mainly just going to be a jumbled mess of me trying to put into words how much I loved this.*ANYTHING BELOW WILL NOT BE SPOILER FREE*You've been warned.Let's just dive into the list of things I love.1. Lysandra. HOLY SHIT. This bitch came out of nowhere and went from being one of my least favorite characters to one of my favorite. I LOVED that we got to learn more about her backstory and the fact that she even had a back story. She was everything I could have hoped for and more. Her friendship with Aelin was so fucking epic, and everything Aelin did for her seriously made me want to cry. She deserves it all. LYSANDRA IS ONE BADASS BITCH. Not only did we learn why she hasn't paid off her debts BUT she's also a shapeshifter. When she saved Rowan and Aedion by shifting into a ghost leopard I flipped, like actually flipped and loved her EVEN MORE.Word to the wise, don't mess with Lysandra.2. Asterin's heart to heart with Manon. I knew that there was going to be SOMETHING going on with Asterin from the way she reacted to the witch covens being forced to produce demon babies. However, I was not quite expecting a backstory that deep. Manon's reaction to her story was even better, meaning that EoS is probably going to have some intense scenes with Manon and good ol' granny. SIGN ME THE F UP.3. When Aedion realized Aelin was in the castle and was in fact about to save him. My heart skipped a few beats.4. When Aelin visited Sam's grave. My heart did not skip a few beats and I'm pretty sure it almost stopped because of how hard I ugly cried. I actually woke my husband up that's how hard I cried.Whatever.Shoot me.5. Chaol. Soooooooo, here's the thing, Alana 100 pages deep in this book would have told Chaol to jump off a cliff. But, Alana 400,500, and 600 pages deep just wanted to hug him and tell him she still loves him and that it's all going to be okay. He grew on me so much throughout this book because of his character growth. And I loved that there was zero awkwardness between him and Aelin.Which leads us to #6.6. ROWAN.Need I say more?Probably not, but I will.My heart beats for Rowan and Aelin. They are it for me. First of all, the tension between the two of them left me fanning myself off. Or dumping a pitcher of cold water over my head like Rowan did ;). These two are EVERYTHING because they heal each other. They have both suffered insurmountable loss that most people would never recover from but together they are better.Rowan is ruthless, loyal, massive, brutal, and extremely aggressive. Above all though, he is a gentlemen. A GENTLEMEN. Who cannot handle a nightgown in the slightest, but still a gentleman.7. Manon vs. Aelin. EPICNESS to say the least. I CANNOT wait for more scenes between the two of them, because holy tempers, they are wild.8. Kaltain tricking the duke and burning down Morath. Another moment of pure epicness that left my mouth gaping for a good few hours. Just another badass woman in this story. Annnnd, let's not forget the little quest she sent Elide on. SO pumped for that.9. Chaol and Dorian reuniting. Queue the tears. When Chaol cried realizing Dorian was saved I'm pretty sure a piece of me died inside because I was so happy. The bromance is real my friends.10. The clock tower blowing up and ruining the castle.I imagine it looking a lil like this.And last but not least 11. Aelin setting foot back on Terrasen soil. THE BITCH DID IT. She really did it. I cannot wait for her reclaim her throne and bring hell to those who deserve it.‚ÄúShe was fire, and light, and ash, and embers. She was Aelin Fireheart, and she bowed for no one and nothing, save the crown that was hers by blood and survival and triumph.‚ÄùYAAAAAAS, my queen!!!!! I cannot wait to see what EoS brings to the table.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""4.5 StarsDefinitely my favorite in the series so far...which surprised me what with how long it was and how long it took me to read it. I usually finish books I am loving within a day or two and this one took me almost a week. But, life happens and I haven't had as much time to dedicate to reading these days.Anyway, that's besides the point and interesting to, well, no one.Moving on.I really loved all the character interactions and dynamics going on in this installment. I just love epic fantasies involving loyalty and character development/surprises and this book was rife with examples of both.The last 200 pages or so were especially awesome as the larger plot lines unfolded. I can't wait to start the next book. And even more exciting? Knowing this series is fully complete now...and and that I already have all the remaining books on my shelves ready to go.Small life victories, my friends!""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Wow,okay.Queen of Shadowswasso, so good.I have been enjoying this series very much up to this point, don't get me wrong, but in my opinion, this one takes it to awhole new level.I won't drag this out, as there probably isn't much I can say that would be new at this point, but I will just let y'all know how this one made me feel;freaking psyched.I am suchtrash for this series. I was legit fangirling for a week after I finishedQueen of Shadows.Sarah J. Maas is my Queen and I will read every single word sheeverwrites.Seriously though, I felt that this developed the story so incredibly well. I loved the relationships and I don't mean that in the romantic sense.For me, it was more the friendships, the loyalties that develop as these characters are basically pitted against the most evil forces in the universe; it was just a gorgeous thing.Lysandra, my new love. Her story arc is just astounding.To see her strength, which obviously has always been there, but to see it come out as she asserts herself and kicks some serious ass was absolutely satisfying.I loved hearing her backstory, learning her motivations and discovering her secrets. I can't wait to see where her story goes in the next book.And of course, Manon,my book-BFF, so fierce and such a powerful bringer of change. I worship her and pretty much every scene she's even remotely involved in gave meLIFE!I am very excited to get toEmpire of Stormsbut I am going to take some time before I start because I do not think I am emotionally ready to move on. There's still so much to process.I am beyond happy that I gave in and read this series;probably one of the best book choices I have ever made. I highly, highly recommend this series to all the world!""}]"

A Curse for True Love (Once Upon a Broken Heart, #3)
",Stephanie Garber,4.13,255430,6040,"Fantasy, Romance, Young Adult, Romantasy, Fantasy Romance, Magic, Fiction",386,24-10-2023,"Two villains, one girl, and a deadly battle for happily ever after.Evangeline Fox ventured to the Magnificent North in search of her happy ending, and it seems as if she has it.

The book we finally deserve after that HORRENDOUS ending to The Ballad of Never After (I loved that ending so much despite how much pain it caused me) and it is finally here. And so is my review which I have been DYING to write ever since the book got announced, and ever since I finished this book.I have so many thoughts but I don\'t even know how to say them. As you can see, I rated this book 4 stars. It\'s gonna be more than 4 stars, but personally, it\'s not a 5 star book for me.ÔΩ°.ÔΩ°:‚àû‚ô°‚ô•ÔΩ°.ÔΩ°The PlotHm...where to begin. I\'ll just start from the beginning. Obviously. But anyways, the beginning of this book was actually a little slow. Mainly because Evangline was relearning everything after her memories were taken, and while I was lowkey stressed out, everything was jumping along pretty smoothly.When Apollo\'s first chapter came around, I literally rolled my eyes because I forgot that he even had chapters in this book. BUT. I was thankfully gifted a Jacks chapter a few chapters later, and that completely lifted my mood. In said chapter, we get THIS absolute gem of a quote that made me choke:‚ÄúHe\'d never understood why someone would watch another person sleep...until her.‚Äùscreaming.Things started to pick back up literally right after Jacks\'s chapter, which I cannot find as a coincidence, because Jacks just makes literally everything better. I was freaking out and hyperventilating for literally no reason at all for like the rest of the book, and let\'s just say, that\'s definitely an experience.After going back through my updates, let\'s just say, I got more and more unhinged as the book continued on and that\'s true, because the book got crazier and crazier.BUT. based on comments I keep getting, I\'m pretty sure I know why Jacks uses his apples but now I know! All is well.Speaking of which, the epilogue killed me. Not because it\'s cute, because it wasn\'t, BUT BECAUSE OF THE LAST LINE. ""Other stories were brewing in the Magnificent North."" WHAT OTHER STORIES STEPHANIE?? I will need them asap thank you. it did feel a little bittersweet though, because the next stories probably won\'t be connected to any of the main characters from this series and Caraval. I\'m still bitter that Tella didn\'t pop up in a cameo.I just realized I have so much more to say on the plot, but I\'ve already written so much so here\'s my final comment on the plot: this book felt a lot more romance heavy than the others. There was just this super weird vibe around the book, as if it had lost all the magic. Don\'t get me wrong, I loved the romance, EvaJacks are my babies, but one of the reasons I love Caraval and OUABH so much wasbecauseof the magic, and this book just seemed to lack it.‚ÄúShe was the moth and Jacks was still the flame.‚Äùü§≠ÔΩ°.ÔΩ°:‚àû‚ô°‚ô•ÔΩ°.ÔΩ°The CharactersMy beloveds. My babies. My world. My everything.Ok, so with Evangeline, she\'s a really good main character, but the thing is, I hate her because I want to be her. I have issues, thank you, I know. Pushing that aside, she is a really good main character, because she makes....semi-rational decisions? Who am I kidding, Evangeline is such an idiot sometimes. There, I said it. She wasn\'t as much of an idiot in this book as she was in the last one, but she kept taking unnecessary risks that had me smacking my forehead because she could literally die. Her main character role saved her though. Other than that, I really like her.Jacks. Prince of Hearts. Archer. Jacks of the Hollow. I will be the Fox to his Archer any day, where can I find the sign up sheet? In all seriousness, I love Jacks so much. I used to hate him in the Caraval series when I first read it (LOOK it was only because I liked Tella and Legend together, all right?) but Jacks is now my bae and I am so sad that we won\'t get to read anything more about him. Jacks is the king of morally grey characters, though I will be honest: I liked him more when he was mean to Evangeline than in the end and they were all lovey dovey. I\'m messed up like that, I like the enemies before the lovers üò≠ In my review of The Ballad of Never After, I did a section where I listed some gems that came out of the Prince of Hearts\'s mouth so I will do that again, the ACFTL EDITION:‚ÄúPlease, Little Fox, remember.‚Äùhehe I think I cried at this part.‚ÄúHow can I make you understand,‚Äù he growled, ‚Äúyou and I together don\'t end well. We just end.‚ÄùPreeetty sure I cried here too. Jacks sure knows how to make me cry.‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt just for now, it‚Äôs for always, Little Fox.‚ÄùWe love a lovesick JacksAnyways, the other characters were pretty good too:Apollo deserved every single last thing that happened to him üå≥üå≥üå≥üå≥üå≥üå≥LaLa and Chaos happening WHEN??? That one scene had me giggling so bad.

Despite all of this, I still wish there was more magic.But anywho, Evangeline and Jacks\'s story is so good, I can\'t even. Like the forbidden/enemies to lovers was so well done. Every time Jacks kept denying her out of love for her made me die and then buried me underground and put a headstone above my grave.The ending brought me back to life though, so I\'m all good now.I talked about a few plot holes I thought I saw here, but apparently I wasn\'t paying much attention, sooo when I\'m less occupied I will talk much more about EvaJacks because they are perfection.Anyways, I had to rant about that, but I love Evangeline and Jacks so much, and WHEN THEY FINALLY KISSED I LITERALLY SCREAMED BECAUSE I\'D WAITED SINCE BOOK ONE FOR THAT MOMENT. Though I\'m ngl that kiss was PATHETIC, I need more.‚ÄúHe gritted his teeth. ‚ÄúBeing yours does not make you mine.‚ÄùI distinctly remember opening my mouth in shock, closing the book dramatically, and then proceeded to roll around on my couch after hearing that.ÔΩ°.ÔΩ°:‚àû‚ô°‚ô•ÔΩ°.ÔΩ°Overall, this book was as good as I expected it to be, I just wish it had exceeded my expectations though!EvaJacks for life until the day I die.4.3 stars‚ÄúHe wanted her to look at him, just once, and know him the way she had before.‚Äù<><><><><><>update: y\'all i just read the bonus epilogue in the barnes and noble one and i\'m gonna cry, i\'m literally gonna buy the book just for thatwhat. i don\'t even....the ending tho (for reference, this is the normal epilogue, i have NO idea what the epilogues are for the other copies, like the barnes and noble exclusive and whatever the other ones are but if y\'all know them feel free to tell me). it made me mad but also made me SO excited at the same time.rtc!!<><><><><><>edit 10/24: happy release day! i initially thought my book was coming in november, but now that it\'s shipped it might be coming tomorrow! <3EDIT ON THE SAME DAY AS THE LAST EDIT: I JUST REALIZED THAT THERE WAS A SYNOPSIS I\'M SO OBLIVIOUS.

The Ballad of Never After was much better than this. But still, I enjoyed this a lot.This was just as engrossing as the previous books but it lacked the magic and hopefulness of previous books.There wasn\'t much plot. Also, why did the characters just disappear? Where is Luc? Where is Marisol? Are they alive? Are they dead?Jacks and Eva\'s scenes were good. But strangely enough, I feel like there weren\'t enough of them. They had much more interactions in the previous books. I expected more scenes.Apollo just ruins everything. He\'s such a one-dimensional character. Even after reading his POV, I couldn\'t connect with his character at all. He was sooo boring.This also felt quite underwhelming and rushed. I don\'t know, there was just something off about it.I thought it would be difficult to get back Eva\'s memory. But it was so easy and it took no effort from Jacks and Eva at all. This is an issue since this is one of the main conflicts of this book. Just interacting with Jacks brought back her memories. That\'s it? It\'s that easy?After so much build-up, I expected a better first kiss between Eva and Jacks. It wasn\'t up to the mark. The biting scene at the end of the first book was much better than this.Jacks is also a villain, correct? So why didn\'t he fight for Eva? I never expected him to just give up. He always gives up and Eva has to run after him to make progress.I needed an epic love confession from Jacks but alas that did not happen.Jacks is still a Fate. Eva is still a mortal. So she\'ll just die while he spends his eternity mourning her?Apollo was a horrible villain. He wasn\'t intimidating at all. He was quite pathetic tbh.I felt like Jacks\' personality completely changed in this book.Jacks used to be a very mercurial character. He could be both cruel and kind at the same time. He was also very flirtatious and charismatic. He stopped being mischievous and teasing. Like his interactions with Eva completely changed. He was more sober and honest in this book which honestly gave me a whiplash.He lacked the magnetic charisma that was so apparent in the previous books.I wanted so much more angst. I wanted to see some pining. I wanted to see some unrequited love. I wanted drama.I wanted Jacks to realise his mistakes and grovel for Eva.I wanted Jacks to change for the better, that\'s true, but I still wanted him to remain the same at the core. I could sometimes see flashes of the old Jacks in this book but that\'s it. I fell in love with the old Jacks who was a moody bastard.Also, I have to say I\'m disappointed by Jacks\' role in this book. He was hardly present and mostly stayed in the background. He felt like a side character. I wish we learned more about his backstory.I think Jacks\' pov wasn\'t needed at all because it ruined the mystery and enigma of his character. It could have been good had it even been written properly.Apollo and Aurora took way too much space. That space should have been given to exploring more of Jacks and Eva\'s dynamic.Everything wasn\'t explained and some loose ends were left untied. The ending too felt rushed and anti-climactic.1) Why does Jacks eat apples? What does the colour of the apple signify?2) How is Jacks able to talk telepathically to Eva?3) Eva still owes Jacks a third kiss according to their bargain. What about that?And so many more questions remain.I think the main reason this book felt so weak is because The Ballad of Never After was just perfect. The pacing, plot and romance were done perfectly. And reading this book has only increased my appreciation for The Ballad of Never After.Ratings-1) Once Upon a Broken Heart- 3.5/5https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...2) The Ballad of Never After- 5/5https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...3) Curse for True Love-2/5Pre-release thoughts-""I\'myourmonster"".Ahhhhhhhhhhh, I\'m dead. I will literally evaporate when I read this quote in the book.I was worried that there would not be a third book. Imagine my sadness and anxiety. I mean, Jacks and Eva deserved a happy ending.Anyway, I\'m really excited about this. I can\'t wait till September! It\'s too far away.I need an ARC like right now.Edit- The summary and cover are here! The cover is gorgeous. All I can say is that Eva deserves better. The poor girl has suffered enough. Just let her live her life happily.Edit 2- The first 4 chapters have been released, including an Apollo pov.

The emotions I felt especially in the last few chapters will have me thinking about it for daysss.I believe while the series was carried by Jacks. This book in particular was carried by Apollo, especially in the first half.The first half was slowish compared to the second. The rush, the romance I felt in the second half made me wonder if I missed out on something in the first 50%.As Evangeline is trying to figure out her reality and to gain her memories back (which she should have been more concerned about) we seeApollocome to terms with what and who he really is. I loved his dark twisted persona. Sure he annoyed me a lot but to see how deluded one can be or what all crazy things obsession can make one do, was so interesting to read.Evangelineseemed incomplete without Jacks. Maybe it was intentional or it\'s just my perception but before Jacks came into the picture, she was so lost. Also, bestie could have put in more effort into gaining her memories back lol.Jacks...Where do I even start? I felt the lack of him. Firstly, he made an appearance after 10 chapters and when he did it came across as cameo appearances for the whole first half. I missed him, terribly. Maybe that is why the first half seemed slow to me. His charm, his love for his little fox is EVERYTHING! The angst he feels was so well written. I needed more of him. His character had so much to say, so much to explore and I believe it kinda got lost in the rush.""You shouldn\'t stare at me like that.""""Then how should I stare?""""You shouldn\'t stare at me at all.""Theromance deserved more pages.I feel like the majority of the time was left exploring how bad Apollo got, that he stole the limelight from the two main characters. The romance at the end came across as rushed. But those few moments that we got, I LOVED it. Absolutely adored it. I won\'t be forgetting about it, believe me.The reasons why this is not a 5 star read for me-1. Am not sure how I feel about the multi pov.Sure it was interesting but it didn\'t really do anything writing wise. It still came across as I was reading the book from Eva\'s pov. Apollo\'s pov was interesting at first, but soon grew old. I got he was dark and was doing his dark business but at the most it should have been like eight chapters. Had the book had more of Jacks pov I would have preferred it more. Jacks pov was also written similarly to Eva\'s. And did I mention I felt the lack of Jacks? Cause I truly did.2. The last 20% of the book was rushed.I would have enjoyed it even more had there been 50-70 pages more. Like the slow burn had been going on for two books and was eating me alive and to rush past it as if we\'re all on a sugar high was not an ideal decision imo. The action sequences could also have used a little more time considering how Apollo went in his lunatic mode.Theendingwas sweet. I know I said it was rushed but only cause I wanted more. I don\'t think I\'ll be over Eva Jacks anytime soon. And correct me if I am wrong but it seems like we might get another spin off? I hope it\'s Chaos\' turn this time ü§≠""Once upon a time, there was nothing but kissing, and everything was perfect.

(i‚Äôve heard that take and i can‚Äôt bring myself to accept it, there‚Äôs a limit for how much u can leave open ended and there was A LOT in this book.)spoiler alert !!let me elaborate on this take - i saw this tiktok talking about how there were so many questions bc it‚Äôs metaphorically supposed to represent the story curse and how no one truly knows what happened, in the case of the valley arch and what happened to the valors themselves. however, i feel like it would‚Äôve been suitable had it not been the last book in this series. this is very conflicting to rate bc on one hand i feel like the romance delivered but on the other hand it feels like the plot wasn‚Äôt completely thought out. and i did expect so much more from the romance still. jacks loved evangeline so much that he rewrote history but we still can‚Äôt get a love confession out of him? üò≠üò≠end of spoilersi‚Äôm not gonna be the first to admit i love stephanie garber‚Äôs writing. i‚Äôve been very vocal about it ever since i first read her other series ‚Äòcaraval‚Äô earlier this year. i don‚Äôt have a problem with her writing, i think that it can be very magical and i‚Äôm glad it hasn‚Äôt changed much. one thing that has changed is the plots of her books. when i read the caraval series, the romance stayed a subplot but with this series, everyone fixates on the romance and i think stephanie garber did the same. at the end she doesn‚Äôt clear anything up and i think it might be a way to appeal to the audience bc let‚Äôs admit - a lot of ppl read fantasy for the sprinkle of romance.i had a few problems with caraval, but overall i loved it and it was very magical. i will stand by this - i love caraval for the magical world building, where the world goes more into depth and is much more magical, and i love ouabh for the romance. don‚Äôt get me wrong, the romance in caraval was almost impeccable. however the characters and their background in this series varied very differently. there was so much depth to these characters and jacks was so much more mysterious. his backstory and everything had me bawling. this is why i truly wanted a better ending for evajacks. i feel very conflicted about this book bc i love the characters so much.unfortunately there are going to be spoilers for the rest of this review. i cannot express a lot of my thoughts without mentioning spoilersthe 2 main villains in this book were aurora and apollo. and like i mentioned before, there was no clarification for the other ‚Äúvillains‚Äù in the previous books. i am so confused why we never find out what happens to all the other villains in the other books. marisol and tiberius had absolutely no role. she leaves it open ended in the other book about tiberius and we never find out what happens to him but apparently in this book we don‚Äôt find out either!! even luc was mentioned once but he never once appeared. it felt as if stephanie garber thought it would be good if she introduced a new villain rather than addressing the previous ones but no!! i expected tiberius to make his comeback but he was only mentioned a few times in the beginning. the fact that he was pretty much all talk no action is prominent in this book lmaoo. and marisol wasn‚Äôt even mentioned. does she just rot in jail..? either way i have hope for stephanie garber. she is still one of my favorite authors and even though i didnt like this book as much, her writing shows promise and i hope that it only improves from now.my thoughts:i‚Äôm ngl i have mixed feelings about chaos, or castor. i felt so sad after that ending with evangeline last book (like everyone else ofc) but i wonder how chaos would‚Äôve reacted if he found out he killed eva. he seemed apologetic in the last book but he ran away (probably bc of fear). but this book he‚Äôs helping eva bc he believed jacks is going to make a huge mistake. i think chaos is overall a good person (even if he went on a whole mf blood rampage üò≠üò≠) but i don‚Äôt blame him after he was forced to wear a helm.And he loved her.He loved her.He loved her.He loved her.He loved her so much he‚Äôd rewritten history. He‚Äôd given up what he had believed was his only chance at love. And now he had finally broken the spell that he never thought he‚Äôd escape.jacks has my whole heart. don‚Äôt u dare try and start with him not deserving a happy ending he has been through so much and he deserves the world. he‚Äôs been through so much pain, and when he talked about how he felt whenever he thought about how evangeline died i lowkey teared up üò≠üíò and when he told her oh my god i was dying. that entire scene is engraved into my brain now. HE ALSO KEPT HER NOTE ABOUT HIM CLOSE TO HIS HEART everything he does is just perfect and amazing<33 every single little detail is forever engraved in my heart.evangeline has been everything throughout this entire series. her dumb decisions kept the book entertaining i‚Äôm not even gonna lie. but also her love confession to jacks had me sobbing my eyes out it was so sweet. she has been through so much and i‚Äôm so so happy she ended up with jacks. she has been through so much and i love how she learned not to be as naive for the most part. she also learned to be more sassy and stand up for herself her character development has been everything. and her slapping apollo after she got her memories back was QUEEN SHIT üëèüëè eva is my girl 4eva and i absolutely love her. even if she was delulu at times but who isn‚Äôt? honestly i love how she still had so much hope but didn‚Äôt feel like it was enough like omg girl üò≠üò≠ i felt so bad for her.i feel like this book went completely off script. it introduced new villains (besides apollo), didn‚Äôt even clarify anything in the previous books, and the ratio of romance changed drastically. i wanted more angst, more JACKS (!!), and a much more deserved ending. i feel as though she just forgot about the other books and decided to change it up. there was so much angst in the previous books and i thought that it would build up in this book into a huge love confession of jacks part but nope. this does not mean i like jacks any less. these characters mean so much to me and i‚Äôm happy that they ended up together.there are spoilers for the caraval series mentioned in this paragraph!!the least disappointing aspect was the romance. but that‚Äôs not to say there was no disappointment bc my expectations were through the roof after tbona. there were sprinkles of it which i didn‚Äôt mind bc it‚Äôs a fantasy book, it‚Äôs not always going to focus on the romance aspects. but i still don‚Äôt understand how their relationship is gonna work with jacks being immortal and evangeline being a human. i mean dante gave up his immortality for donatella ü•π i rlly expected a grand gesture from jacks, or anything. the best we got was an ‚Äúi love you‚Äù and even though im happy he said it, it was the bare. fucking. minimum. and it hurts me to say that, trust me. the romance was through the roof with this series, but it drastically changed in this book. their love expanded to every universe and we couldn‚Äôt even get a love confession out of jacks? i will never get over that.the plot twist about the truth of jacks curse? i‚Äôm ngl my heart broke a little after hearing donatella never loved him which was why she survived his kiss. this is not me in any saying i ship them. but when you think about their history and how it applies then knowing the info now, it makes me feel for jacks. he dyed his hair dark blue, it was clear he was heartbroken. and to learn she never had any feelings for him made me feel a bit of nostalgia. also i have another question - does jacks ever find out the truth of his kisses and how they‚Äôre only deadly if someone who will never love him kisses him..?the ending with apollo becoming part of the tree actually made me laugh. another thing that has me laughing was how stephanie garber talked in an interview about how the tree on the cover is important in the book AND ITS LITERALLY THE TREE APOLLO GOT TRAPPED IN üò≠üò≠ she rlly knows us!! i‚Äôm so glad he got what was coming to him. that scene frustrated me so much and I‚ÄôM SO GLAD JACKS GAVE HIM WHAT HE DESERVED!! i waited 2 books for jacks to finally punch apollo and it happened, and i‚Äôm so satisfied with that !! and him cursing at apollo had my entertainment reaching its peak. i will say she had me in the first few chapters feeling sympathy for apollo but that quickly went away after everything happened. i‚Äôm still upset he killed the guards that only followed his command ‚òπÔ∏è‚Äîthe rest of this review is going to be talking about things that were mentioned/i still had questions about after the ending.would you guys believe me if i said this book was going to previously by 4.5 stars? maybe u won‚Äôt, but it‚Äôs true. during the beginning, it was rlly slow bc apollo made so many appearances and i was bored out of my mind. but every time jacks showed up it made everything better. at one point, i was contemplating on giving it 4.75 stars. can u imagine my disappointment at giving it the rating i‚Äôm giving it now?probably notbut the ending was disappointing. maybe it was just me idk but it isn‚Äôt even about the apples as much.speaking of the apples, i didnt mind that as much simply bc she explicitly stated that we would know, and even addressed it which was what i wanted the entire time. if she addressed any of the plot holes, i would‚Äôve been happy. the point of a finale is to wrap everything up and maybe if she wrote another book in this series i‚Äôd be happy but this is the end of THIS series so i don‚Äôt get why so many things were alluded. the fan theories for the apples have me squealing, i‚Äôm kinda glad she didn‚Äôt explicitly state it simply bc letting us gather our own conclusion lets us be delulu.another thing - the broken heart scar? i don‚Äôt understand why it was never used. was it just a way for eva to sense whenever jacks was nearby since it glowed? i expected more from that. i read the bonus epilogues, and it‚Äôs clear that stephanie hasn‚Äôt forgotten about it. she mentions it but doesn‚Äôt even tell us what‚Äôs gonna happen. i really expected something when it was first mentioned in the beginning while i was reading this book. i thought the mention of the scar was going to be foreshadowing but i was disappointed to find out it wasn‚Äôt. it‚Äôs basically used as a tell tale sign that jacks is nearby.something i‚Äôm curious about is how evangeline didn‚Äôt die when she kissed jacks. i think the obstacle of apollo helped show how he would meet his end eventually but also i think it helped show that there were other forms of consequences? idk i can‚Äôt wrap my head around the fact that it was so easy for them to finally kiss after not kissing for over 2 books. there‚Äôs no confirmation, just guesses evangeline has made which makes it all the more confusing. she talks about how his love might help break the curse but i wish stephanie garber confirmed at least something. i finished reading and i honest to god had to think about this book for a long time. it was so bittersweet finishing this series. but the scene where jacks had a scare and he was scared she was dying but she just forgot to breath was so cute i was laughing through my tears at that ü•πü©∑i‚Äôm disappointed lala didn‚Äôt end up punching aurora, which would‚Äôve been fully deserved. we don‚Äôt find out anything ab lala besides the fact that she was left alone w aurora after eva left to stop jacks. and it‚Äôs clear that she wasn‚Äôt punched since she was able to leave lala and distract jacks from finding evangeline. i wonder what‚Äôs gonna happen with lala now that she‚Äôs done her part helping eva find jacks in their last quest? i feel like it was only a happy conclusion for evajacks and not anyone else who helped them along the way. also i‚Äôm so sad she didn‚Äôt get a happy ending even after meeting her true love. she truly deserves one and i hope stephanie garber does end up writing another series for her.ÀèÀã¬∞‚Ä¢*‚ÅÄ‚û∑once upon a broken heart - 4.5 starsthe ballad of never after - 4.5 starsa curse for true love - 3.5 starspre-reviewi can‚Äôt believe i finished this series. i just know i‚Äôm gonna have the biggest hangover over these characters and the world stephanie garber has created ü•π rtc soon ü§ç but for now i just have to say ‚Äòsay don‚Äôt go‚Äô by taylor swift is soo evajacks codedreading reviewi‚Äôve been waiting for this day for FUCKING FOREVER and i‚Äôm so excited!!pre-read review3 DAYS LEFT!! and i‚Äôm going crazy !!!after reading tbonano words will ever describe how badly iNEEDthis book. i understand everyone‚Äôs pain now. i desperately need evajacks to be endgame and i‚Äôm not accepting anything else.before reading tbonai manifested that this book would come sooner and instead the date levitated farther away'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'My heart is broken, and not for the right reason.This was my most anticipated read and I\'m really disappointed, and it\'s not even because my expectations were too high. I love Stephanie Garber and I would read anything from her since I love the way she tells stories. And this story was not it for me unfortunately!Like this is the last book, so many loose ends to tie up and so many juicy secrets to finally discover, and somehow it was so boring üò≠ half of the book is flashbacks as Evangeline is busy ‚ú®Ô∏èremembering‚ú®Ô∏è and it\'s often just PARAGRAPHS cut and pasted from TBONA or OUABH. Maybe it\'s because I read both so recently, but it felt repetitive really quick.There was no clear plot. I don\'t know where the story was going half the time and like something would happen and I\'d think, okay let\'s go!!! but then that plotline would just randomly be abandoned??üò≠ We never see Luc, Apollo doesn\'t continue trying to woo Eva for an heir and instead starts killing people unprovoked?? Why is Castor just killing people?? What happened with Robin and Lala??? Byron and Petra?? WHERE IS MARISOL? That Garrick guy?? I feel like so many things were introduced but weren\'t properly fleshed out that I don\'t see the point in mentioning it in the first place?? The most offensive was with the last heart scar, SO MANY POSSIBILITIES. Garrick and his posse hunting Jacks and Evangeline owes him a debt, like that\'s SPICY TEA. But then it\'s never important again üò≠ it\'s just so frustrating!!Like I said, I thought half the book was slow and boring and awfully repetitive and the only thing I LOVED DEEPLY was Jacks‚Äôs POV and anytime he was actually on the page. Mind you, my prince only had 5 chapters üò≠üò≠ The evajacksie fandom always joke that Jacks is so mysterious (and he is!!!) so finally learning about him was the highlight!!! The pining for Evangeline in the early chapters, UGH PURE GOLD!!! I wished his story wasn\'t just lightly brushed over and I wished he could have been the one to tell Evangeline everything instead of just hearing it from Castor, LaLa and Aurora. I think that plays a role into why it just felt so disconnected. And then, I don\'t get Jacks motivation at all. At first, yes he\'s training Eva so she doesn\'t die, then he wants her to get her memory back so bad...? I dont think I caught why?? Then he wants to keep her away so he doesn\'t hurt her... okayyy, then why did he come in the first place?? Why did she need her to remember?? It felt very whiplashyüò≠Still, Jacks was the best character. Everyone else felt cartoonish. I was upset at most of the plot twist because COME ON!! It\'s the last book and THIS is what you give meüò≠üò≠ It felt so cheap?? Also!!! How did Jacks become a Fate? Aurora\'s curse?? No, LaLa said he CHOOSE to be one and he said it was so that Castor wouldn‚Äôt be alone. Then how did it actually happen? The Tree of Souls? Who did he sacrifice to be immortal then? And from Caraval, didn\'t that lady (cannot remember her name) and the Fallen Star create the Fates???üò≠üò≠ Like, I shouldn\'t be having this many questions in the LAST BOOK.My thoughts are everywhere, but I don\'t think we needed this book. Yes, all the EvaJacks fluff was my LIFE but it could have been a novellaüò≠ we could have had like a story of the North type thing to just tell us everything about Jacks past and how he\'s in love with Evangeline. But half of this book felt like fan service, and the other was boring and uneventful plotlines.IT\'S JUST SO FRUSTRATING!!!! We could have deleved into the Valors more!! Aurora literally being the one to curse Jacks shouldn\'t have just been a passing line!! We could have cut down half of the Evangeline ‚ú®Ô∏èremembering‚ú®Ô∏è scenes and Apollo being unhinged to go deeper into that storyline. But instead, it was rushed and glossed over ???? There\'s just something off about this book. I dont know, it doesn\'t have the essence of Once Upon A Broken Heart.Stephanie did say she rewrote it, but I honestly would have preferred it if she postponed the release longer to make it flow better because right now it\'s clunky and feels like a shell of a story. It\'s just upsetting because Stephanie had SO many options to make this the greatest love story of all time and it just fell flatüíîÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩüèπüçéü¶ä[27 October 2023 ]UPDATE on this! Firstly, no one ever reads my reviews so I wasn\'t expecting anyone to see this or agree with me but omg!! YOU GET MEüò≠There\'s been a lot of discourse on evajacks twitter and I wanted to share more of my 2 centsü•∞ obviously reviews are for readers and people should NOT be going under Stephanie Garber\'s Instagram posts and not only spoiling the book for everyone else, but also complaining about how much they hated it??? Hello???That being said, I don\'t think it\'s fair to be upset at anyone who criticises ACFTL and shame negative opinions just because Stephanie worked hard and we\'re not writers so we don\'t know anything üò≠ Please be serious. This series is my favourite and it literally hurts that I didn\'t love it, I so desperately wanted to love it and buy multiple copies for decoration and make it my entire personality for the rest of my life, but now I can\'t because I cannot just pretend I love it for the sake of it! Like let me be upset in peace!?!?I\'ve had a couple of days to sit on it and let my thoughts marinate even more, but like I said, I don\'t think my expectations were too high? Like I\'ve read the Caraval books, OUABH and TBONA, I know what to expect from a Stephanie Garber book, hence why I love Stephanie Garber books. The only thing I was ""expecting"" were things she mentioned that seemed important (and some were very important) but were either ignored or rushed.The thought that prompted me to make an update was the ‚ú®Ô∏èlove confession‚ú®Ô∏è. My favourite thing about Evangeline was that she was just like me and she so desperately just wanted to be loved and wanted to be chosen. As per my favourite quote;""This was why parts of Jacks‚Äôs story had twisted so painfully inside her. It wasn‚Äôt because she wanted Jacks. She didn‚Äôt want Jacks. She just wanted someone to want her the way Jacks had wanted this girl. And she didn‚Äôt want it to be because of a spell or a curse. Evangeline wanted a real love powerful enough to break a spell, which was exactly what Jacks wanted, too.""Girl just wanted someone to go above and beyond for her like Jacks wanted to do for Donatella and I don\'t think she got that. Sure, Jacks went back in time to save Evangeline‚Äôs life, but then he wanted to be as far from her as possible. He didn‚Äôt fight for her. He didn\'t try again with Honora to break his curse (because if it\'s a curse that little old Aurora put, how is it that her mother can\'t break it?) He didn\'t try to find a back door for his own curse, or through the debt she still owed. NOTHING. He chose to leave to protect her and Evangeline practically begged him to please just TRY for herüò≠ Even then, HE STILL DIDN\'T TRY AND PUSHED HER AWAY!So when the love confession scene comes and Evangeline is pouring her heart out and Jacks just says ""I love you""??????? The debate around this is that, well it would be out of character for Jacks to give a big grand love confession and I disagree! Of course, if he gave the typical Apollo lovesick cursed confession then yeah that\'s odd, but NO ONE WAS EXPECTING THAT. I thought that his POVs revealed his true feelings and if those were put into dialogue with an ""I love you"" at the end, THAT\'S LITERALLY THE MOST PERFECT LOVE CONFESSION! My issue is that we as the audience know how he feels, but Evangeline doesn\'t since she wasn\'t in his head with us!!So yeah, Jacks didn\'t fight for Evangeline, she fought for him. He only fought for her AFTER she was already safe and when there was no longer a threatü§† ""HE WAS TRAUMATISED! SHE DIED IN HIS ARMS!""

it gave me a headache. however, i enjoyed reading about why he was the way he was, even his backstory. i highlighted the entire page where he died because of the tree of souls, a seamless conclusion by the way.i read the b&n alternate ending, which i then cried over for multiple hoursdays.it\'s so precious and just exactly what i imagined for them, i loved the way aspects from even the first book were incorporated into it, and wish itwasthe ending!i read a curse for true love withtanyaandroro, which was the most fun and i loved talking with them! they waited2 monthsto read this with me, if that doesn\'t say ""kindest people ever,"" i don\'t know what does. you can see their reviews here:tanya\'sroro\'sa little side note - toirha, who i spammed with my thoughts and feelings the minute after finishing acftl, it\'s the best talking to you and you\'re perfect, i\'m convinced <3 this isher review.also to siffie,whose reviewmakes me just want to click *copy paste*my favorite quotes~ spoilers ~‚Äúyou told me it would take the life of the person i love the most.‚Äù‚Äúit is,‚Äù wolfric replied. ‚Äúit‚Äôs taking you.‚Äù‚Äúi am jacks‚Äôs true love. i believe it with the same confidence that i believe that water fills the oceans and morning follows the night. i believe it with all my heart and soul. and there has to be some sort of magic in that.‚Äù‚Äúhe loved her so much he‚Äôd rewritten history. he‚Äôd given up what he had believed was his only chance at love. and now he had finally broken the spell that he never thought he‚Äôd escape.‚Äù‚Äúthe story could have ended there, with the villain defeated and the happy couple about to go off to some ambiguous happily ever after.‚Äù‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt stare at me like that.‚Äù‚Äúthen how should i stare?‚Äù‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt stare at me at all.‚Äùpre-reviewmy copy finally arrived!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""‚ûµ ‚ôæÔ∏è stars‚Äúùôáùô§ùô´ùôûùô£ùôú ùôÖùôñùôòùô†ùô® ùôõùôöùô°ùô© ùôôùô§ùô§ùô¢ùôöùôô ùôõùôßùô§ùô¢ ùô©ùôùùôö ùô®ùô©ùôñùôßùô©. ùòΩùô™ùô© ùôÄùô´ùôñùô£ùôúùôöùô°ùôûùô£ùôö ùôùùôñùôô ùô°ùôöùôñùôßùô£ùôöùôô ùô©ùôùùôñùô© ùô°ùô§ùô´ùôö ùô¨ùôñùô® ùô¢ùô§ùôßùôö ùô©ùôùùôñùô£ ùôñ ùôõùôöùôöùô°ùôûùô£ùôú. ùòºùô£ùôô ùôûùô© ùôôùôûùôôùô£‚Äôùô© ùôùùôñùô´ùôö ùô©ùô§ ùôóùôö ùôñ ùô®ùôñùôõùôö ùôòùôùùô§ùôûùôòùôö, ùôóùôöùôòùôñùô™ùô®ùôö ùô°ùô§ùô´ùôö ùô¨ùôñùô® ùôñùô°ùô®ùô§ ùô¢ùô§ùôßùôö ùô•ùô§ùô¨ùôöùôßùôõùô™ùô° ùô©ùôùùôñùô£ ùôõùôöùôñùôß. ùôÑùô© ùô¨ùôñùô® ùô©ùôùùôö ùô™ùô°ùô©ùôûùô¢ùôñùô©ùôö ùôõùô§ùôßùô¢ ùô§ùôõ ùôùùô§ùô•ùôö. ùôÑùô© ùô¨ùôñùô® ùô®ùô©ùôßùô§ùô£ùôúùôöùôß ùô©ùôùùôñùô£ ùôòùô™ùôßùô®ùôöùô®.‚Äùi know there‚Äôs already a spoiler warning on the review, but if you haven‚Äôt read this book / series yet, i highly suggest not reading this review, because it will have spoilers and quotes <3souls were healed, hearts were put back together, and happiness was found.*deep breaths*, i feel empty, and yet so full. empty because evajacks are my everything, and now i‚Äôve finished their beautiful story. and full because evajacks endgame was everything i needed and more. i cannot express my love for evajacks with words, but i swear if y‚Äôall could see my heart right now, you‚Äôd see flowers blooming. whoever said magic doesn‚Äôt exist, truly hasn‚Äôt read evangeline and jacks‚Äô story. because i‚Äôm one hundred percent sure this is exactly what magic feels like. i get goosebumps just thinking about them. i feel everything when i‚Äôm thinking about them.am i crying while writing this review rn ?

THE GROWTH. Idc what anyone says, I thought her character development here was actively felt. she had a better sense of awareness (compared to ouabh) and all while she remained herself with the belief she has in everything working out and that hopeful loving heart of hers. A heart I‚Äôm so glad she has because without it‚Äî I‚Äôm not sure she would‚Äôve been able to endure all of the challenging obstacles. Our little fox stood up for herself and how she felt and didn‚Äôt back down and I was so proud and admired her strength in doing so.jacksfinally we got his pov and it was everything to see how he felt while it lasted. there‚Äôs much to say about him despite him having all of 5 chapters and i refuse to believe that‚Äôs it?! i truly treasured what we did get of him and was the happiest when we got his first pov. He definitely had most of our hearts here. Anyways, getting to know how he felt was much needed even if it was the fear and anguish he felt in putting Eva in danger. it was clearly easier for him to deny himself and deliberately destroy any chance to be happy as he felt he wasn‚Äôt deserving of it. I know how tormented and haunted he felt and it crushed me as we all know he enjoyed inflicting pain but not receiving it himself. I‚Äôm really gonna miss his ravishing and animatedapple eating scoundrelself‚ÄúIt‚Äôs you. It will always be you, until the end of time. And I‚Äôll fight fate or anyone else who tries to tear us apart‚Äîincluding you.‚Äùevajacksthey are the epitome of enchantment and curious wonder. I don‚Äôt remember any of the ones most of us grew up with that shared the exact qualities these two had‚Äîespecially their banter. What did it for me was: the tangible yet intangible little touches between them, the subtle hints of romance in each and every word that they said and didn‚Äôt say with their hearts, jacks best day, the note, the little banter and angst between them, chapter 41 (forever ingrained in my heart and mind), eva & jacks protectiveness and unrelenting determination in not giving up on each other‚Äîall of that is what I loved from this. I‚Äôm gonna miss these two precious characters so much as I‚Äôve truly enjoyed their journey in all that they weren‚Äôt to what they became and it‚Äôs been utterly bittersweetMy issues with this:Starting with Apollo and all I‚Äôll say is that I‚Äôm glad he got the ending he deserved‚Äîit was very fitting to the joke that he was lol. While I was annoyed with how many POVs we got from him, (as I feel like it overshadowed in some way Eva and jacks POVs) I do see how it worked for the story and for the dramatic effect of this. However, I wish Stephanie compensated in giving us more of jacks POVs as well as it made the most sense to given this is the conclusion to their story and from all the build up in the previous books since it felt in someway disappointing. Aside from giving us the jacks we got in tbona as he was missed here. Definitely validate each rating given to this because of the loving yet conflicting things felt about it.I‚Äôm greedy and wanted more of them as it didn‚Äôt feel enough once things finally happened ü•≤ I‚Äôm sad their story is over as they‚Äôre now permanently etched into my brain and I‚Äôd love more of jacks and Eva with more domestic scenes in a novella. I wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to any fanfics honestly lol as these books brought back the spellbinding fairytale feels we all enjoy. I‚Äôm hoping this universe continues with lalas and chaos‚Äô story as I saw the potentialThe bonus epilogues of alternate endings were so endearing and gave me what I felt the ending to this lacked as it felt rushed. this book in general felt like it was missing so much. But as Evangeline says‚Äùevery story has the possibility for infinite endings‚Äùto which held true here.OUABHTBONAI highlighted practically every encounter and word spoken between them so here‚Äôs 4 quotes:‚ÄúI‚Äôm your monster, Evangeline.‚Äù‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather go up in flames with him than watch while he burns.‚Äù‚Äúlove was more than a feeling. And it didn‚Äôt have to be the safe choice, because love was also more powerful than fear. It was the ultimate form of hope. It was stronger than curses.‚Äù‚ÄúEvangeline knew he would carry her through more than just freezing waters. He would pull her through fire if he had to, haul her from the clutches of war, from falling cities and breaking worlds.‚Äî‚ÄîThenerves and excitementI feel rn is so real ü•π bingeing this all I can tonight but I‚Äôm already seeing how difficult it‚Äôs gonna be not being able to speak about it for now.

And I must admit, this book was magnificent on its own. It made me fall in love with fantasy and romance and fairytales all over again (like I spent a day in my life not loving those three but let\'s not get into details). This is my favorite installment in this series and I\'ll list a few non-spoilery reasons why I loved it so much:1) IT WAS FAST-PACED As we all know by now (I sound like a broken record), my reading hasn\'t been great lately and I struggle finishing ANYTHING! This book, I flew through it! From the very first to the very last page, it kept my attention, it was atmospheric, action-packed. I must admit, not as many twists as in the previous books but those are not neccessary for a book to be good or enjoyable. Miss Garber is a fantastic storyteller and even though her characters and stories aren\'t my ""Roman Empire"" (I tend to think more about darker and sadder stories, yes I\'m crazy and those stick with me), but in the moment, when I\'m reading them, I feel like I\'m in a Disney movie. The atmosphere is something this author is very good at creating and the feeling of escaping reality is something most of our readers look for. What we need, she delivers!2) A PERFECT ENDING As we all know, once again, book 2 ended on a terrible cliffhanger and I was very curious on how would this end, especially since the book is not that long and there was MUCH to unfold. I didn\'t predict the exact ending we got but I\'m satisfied with it, it was along the line of what I thought it would be like... It wrapped up the story beautifully, all the characters stayed true to their nature, and THE VIBES WERE VIBING.3) THE WRITING WAS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL I\'m a huge fan of this author\'s writing, it\'s perfect for fantasy, especially romantasy. I thought I forgot details about the plot and I would need a good reread, but that turned out to not be the case. Garber eased us back into the story as an expert she is, reminded me of the little things I forgot about without any big info dumps or any dragging in the terms of plot. There were so many sappy moments and that one quote about having two hearts, one that breaks and the other one that beats and keeps you alive, MY BRAIN WILL COME BACK TO THAT ONE SOMETIME AROUND MINDNIGHT TONIGHT I JUST KNOW IT4) EVAJACKS DELIVERED This is but it doesn\'t need to be a point. I expected them to be perfect and they were indeed perfect. I loved their story in previous two books, but the tension, the yearning, their love really got to shine in this book.I don\'t want to make this review any longer. I\'m pretty afraid I\'ll repeat myself or spoil anything. I was incredibly scared going into this but it turned out to be a wonderful reading experience. STEPHANIE GARBER WE NEED MORE BOOKS IN THIS UNIVERSE, THANK YOU (something about Chaos perhaps???)ÔøΩÔøΩüíìüíïüíì'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3 starsAfter reading this last book, I seriously think it\'s overrated. The book lacked a lot of things, and I thought the last book would make up for not giving us cute scenes of EvaJacks in previous books, but there was nothing. NOTHING.‚ùùI am a monster, but whether you remember it or not, I‚Äôm your monster, Evangeline.‚ùûI really tried to love it, I do like some of its scenes, but this one didn\'t live up to its hype. TBONA had some cute scenes of EvaJacks, but mostly it was Jacks saving Eva\'s life again and again, and her realizing her love for him. In this book,Jacks however, felt like a side character.In fictional books, even if the main hero is not on the pages, he still has enough importance or, I don\'t know, JUST SOMETHING that you still remember him. But here I was constantly waiting for Jacks\' POV to come, otherwise, there was no scene of Jacks in the first 60 pages. Apollo was there, and his POVs are the most useless things ever.This book just dragged and dragged, and the slow-burn was nearly nonexistent when there were barely interactions between Eva & Jacks in this book.Instead of giving them a proper ending and some domestic scenes and filling the blanks of the last two books and revelation of some minor cute details we missed, WE GOT APOLLO\'S POV???ü§° EvaJacks literally have one kiss throughout this whole trilogy, and literally zero confession scenes? That ""I love you"" moment made me feel nothing. I was numb by the point I reached there.‚Ä¢ Basically, Eva lost her memory in this book, and Apollo made Jacks seem like the villain after he was the one who wiped her memories. Apollo tried to rewrite the history, but Eva was still determined to get her memories back, and she felt that something was WRONG. It\'s not what she wanted. Jacks came into her life again but this time as Archer, and she was immediately drawn to himagain.Now the whole Archer thing didn\'t last much, I expected self-defense lesson scenes, but Jacks disappeared after that. He came back just to save her and went again.Apollo and Eva kissed more than Evajacks did, and Apollo is such a bitch? I WILL NOT FORGET THAT MF LOSER PATHETIC PERSON. He legit killed a 14-year-old boy like whyyyyyyyy????? That boy was traumatized and survived, and he was like \'he\'s too trusting, I did him a favor\' üñïüèªI thought Apollo was more like a Tamlin-Adam Kent type of character, but he\'s literally the worst. THEY were at least better and weren\'t entirely selfish, they wanted the girl, that\'s why they did questionable things, but Apollo was just a stuck-up narcissist who was delusional as fuck and believed that he would get Evangeline because he\'s better thanJACKS.Well, fuck you, got to be kidding me üòí and even though I might have thought that he would become better and I might not hate him, his character was getting worse, and he died such a horrifying death that I\'m actually glad for it. I suspected that he would be the one who\'ll die because if he had truly loved Eva, he wouldn\'t have tried to sacrificed her to become an immortal.The Valors suck! They were useless, petty, whiny, pathetic creatures exceptCastorüòå, but yeah, I hated them.They were here for page fillers, and their entire existence was as useless as Apollo\'s POV. Aurora was the actual VILLAIN ‚Äì a shitty one at that ‚Äì and she was the one who put the fatal kiss and the archer\'s kiss curse on Jacks like WHAAAATTT- I thought she was one of the good guys. Everyone sucks, and I hate them sfm!‚ùùJacks had so badly wanted to tell her that he couldn‚Äôt even remember what Donatella looked like, that Evangeline‚Äôs face was the only one he saw whenever he closed his eyes, that he would go with her anywhere . . . if he could.‚ùûJacks\' past was truly sad, even tho he did do questionable things, we literally GOT 0 CONFESSION (as in I DID THAT BECAUSE BLAH BLAH AND I DIDN\'T MEAN THAT BLAH BLAH), but he stayed true to his character.The vulnerability throughout this book was the main thing why I still liked it. Evangeline\'s love and her hope that it would be enough to break the curse and Jacks sacrificing his beating heart just to get the cuff that\'ll protect Evangeline forever, and she won\'t get hurt were literally the best parts.I love Jacks so much, and Eva had good character development. It\'s just her BLUSHING at everything was unnecessary just like Apollo\'s POV. Nvm this book didn\'t give us any cute scenes!Marisol\'s ending was left out, and I doubt she\'d get her own book. Luc didn\'t make any appearance, and he should have apologized.Evangeline is human, and Jacks is not quite immortal, he\'s ageless, so obviously, Eva will become older.There should be a scene where Jacks gifts her a YOUTH STONE NECKLACE so that she stays young with him forever, but obv we got NOTHING. I\'m just happy it\'s a HEA.FFS NO APPLE CONFESSION? I figured it was just so he could stop himself from hurting anyone and not kissing anyone.He needed so many apples with Eva because if he didn\'t have them, he might kiss her and all. The colors were just a unique touch. Now I do hope the author gives us Lala/Chaos, and she leaves Dane for good and realizes that she was wrong to hold on to her love for him him forever.‚Ä¢Once Upon A Broken Heart‚Äì 4 stars‚Ä¢The Ballad Of Never After‚Äì 3.75 stars'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4,5 ‚òÖ‚ÄúùôÑ ùôñùô¢ ùôñ ùô¢ùô™ùôßùôôùôöùôßùôöùôß. ùôÑ ùôöùô£ùôüùô§ùôÆ ùôùùô™ùôßùô©ùôûùô£ùôú ùô•ùôöùô§ùô•ùô°ùôö. ùôÑ ùô°ùôûùô†ùôö ùôóùô°ùô§ùô§ùôô. ùôÑ ùô°ùôûùô†ùôö ùô•ùôñùôûùô£. ùôÑ ùôñùô¢ ùôñ ùô¢ùô§ùô£ùô®ùô©ùôöùôß, ùôóùô™ùô© ùô¨ùôùùôöùô©ùôùùôöùôß ùôÆùô§ùô™ ùôßùôöùô¢ùôöùô¢ùôóùôöùôß ùôûùô© ùô§ùôß ùô£ùô§ùô©, ùôÑ\'ùô¢ ùôÆùô§ùô™ùôß ùô¢ùô§ùô£ùô®ùô©ùôöùôß, ùôÄùô´ùôñùô£ùôúùôöùô°ùôûùô£ùôö.‚ÄùMama I‚Äôm in love with a criminal, but he has pretty dimples so it‚Äôs forgivable~Anyways uhm hello??????

Oder werden sie sich gegenseitig zerst√∂ren?Ruby steht unter Schock: Sie wurde vom Maxton-Hall-College suspendiert. Und das Schlimmste: Alles deutet darauf hin, dass niemand anders als James daf√ºr verantwortlich ist. Ruby kann es nicht glauben - nicht nach allem, was sie gemeinsam durchgestanden haben. Sie dachte, dass sie den wahren James kennengelernt hat: den, der Tr√§ume hat, den, der sie zum Lachen bringt und ihr Herz mit einem einzigen Blick schneller schlagen l√§sst. Doch w√§hrend Ruby daf√ºr k√§mpft, trotz allem ihren Abschluss machen zu k√∂nnen, droht James einmal mehr unter den Verpflichtungen gegen√ºber seiner Familie zu zerbrechen. Und die beiden m√ºssen sich fragen, ob die Welten, in denen sie leben, nicht vielleicht doch zu verschieden sind ...","[{'rating': 2, 'content': 'Na wer freut sich schon wieder auf meine Meinung zu diesem Buch? :DHiermit habe ich - und somit auch ihr - es ja zum Gl√ºck geschafft! Ich konnte es dann irgendwie doch nicht auf mir sitzen lassen, die Reihe einfach abzubrechen, nachdem ich mich ja durch Band 1 UND 2 durchgek√§mpft habe. Also habe ich ein paar l√§ngere Autofahrten genutzt um diesen letzten Band zu konsumieren.Und wie bereits zu erwarten war konnte mich auch der finale Band nicht mehr √ºberzeugen. Ich wei√ü echt nicht was das sollte, es passiert quasi NICHTS. Aber dennoch passiert irgendwie voll viel, da die Geschichte hier permanent zwischen den ganzen Perspektiven der nahezu unz√§hligen P√§rchen springt. Das h√§tte man sich sparen k√∂nnen, denn es wurden einfach unn√∂tig viele Themen (durchaus auch interessante!) angeschnitten, aber die Geschichte wurde diesen Themen einfach nicht gerecht. Dann h√§tte man es doch lieber wie bei der Again-Reihe machen k√∂nnen, wo jedes P√§rchen ihr eigenes Buch bekam...Die Dramen waren auch wieder an den Haaren herbeigezogen und aufgrund der F√ºlle an Themen auch einfach jedes mal viel zu schnell und zu vorhersehbar abgehandelt. Die Charaktere fand ich leider nach wie vor auch eher blass und unauthentisch. Am traurigsten finde ich, dass die Gef√ºhle zwischen Ruby und James (und auch bei den anderen P√§rchen) einfach null bei mir ankamen...Der Schreibstil war gewohnt gut und das Buch hatte auch wieder unfreiwillig einen gewissen Unterhaltungswert f√ºr mich. Daher geb ich noch nett gemeinte 2 Sterne.Zusammenfassend l√§sst sich sagen, dass mich diese Reihe leider von vorne bis hinten nicht von sich √ºberzeugen konnte, obwohl ich die Again-Reihe der Autorin ganz gerne mag.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'F√ºr mich ist und bleibt diese Reihe einfach over hyped ...Meiner Meinung nach ziehen sich die B√ºcher von Mona Kasten tats√§chlich immer und bei dieser Reihe bin ich mit Ruby und James bis zum Schluss nicht warm geworden.Diese ‚Äûbesondere‚Äú Beziehung/Chemie zwischen den beiden erreichte mich einfach nicht und war dementsprechend nicht vorhanden.Die beiden kamen bei mir auch nicht so erwachsen und reif an, wie sie wahrscheinlich dastehen sollten.Wenn die ganze Reihe √ºber Alistair gewesen w√§re, h√§tte ich mich tierisch gefreut, aber was nicht ist das ist nicht ...'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Ich muss ehrlich gesagt zugeben, dass ich mir √ºber das Rating dieses Buches noch unsicher bin. (Es schwankt aber irgendwo zwischen 2-4 Sternen haha). Ich habe monatelang auf das Finale der Maxton Hall Reihe hingefiebert und obwohl Band 1 und 2 in meinen Augen noch lange nicht ""PERFEKT"" waren, habe ich sie trotz ihrer Fehler und Unschl√ºssigkeiten geliebt. Und das wollte ich bei ""Save Us"" auch unbedingt, aber letztendlich war es mir viel zu vorhersehbar und die Charaktere haben mich zwischendrin echt aufgeregt. (Insbesondere Ember huh)Meiner Meinung nach hat sich das Buch sehr gezogen und ich bin bis zum Ende hin nicht wirklich mit Ruby & James warmgeworden. Meiner Meinung nach hatte jedes P√§rchen aus Monat B√ºchern mehr Chemie als die beiden zusammen. Der Fakt der mich aber am meisten gest√∂rt hat war, dass man von Anfang an wusste (SPOILER F√úR BAND 1 & 2 INCOMING) wer die Bilder von Ruby geschossen hatte und jedes einzelne Problem erstmal total hochgepuscht und viel Drama drum gemacht wurde, aber letztendlich haben sich alle immer nach 2 S√§tzen verziehen?! Besonders das Verhalten von Ruby\'s Mum war mir sehr suspekt, da sie sich am Ende von Band 2 ihrer Tochter einfach total unakzeptabel gegen√ºber verhalten hat, jedoch danach wieder sofort nett umgesprungen ist. Daran sieht man einfach nochmal, dass die Geschichte von Ruby & James einfach marketingtechnisch total in die L√§nge gezogen wurde, obwohl man sie viel fr√ºher h√§tte abhaken k√∂nnen.Nichtsdestotrotz konnte ich das Buch innerhalb von wenigen Stunden lesen und da ich Mona\'s Schreibstil einfach liebe, habe ich ihr auch vieles wieder verziehen. Vor allen Dingen habe ich die britische Atmosph√§re geliebt, da ich wieder totales Fernweh bekommen habe. Die Maxton Hall Reihe wird wohl niemals zu meinen liebsten Buchreihen geh√∂ren, aber ich sehe sie als ""Guilty Pleasure"", weswegen ich hier als offizielles Rating trotzdem noch 4 Sterne vergebe.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""my people üò≠üò≠üò≠ my loves üò≠üò≠üò≠ i love them so much üò≠üò≠üò≠ i can't believe it's over üò≠üò≠üò≠So many things happened in this book.

The way they react to any problem or situation that gets in their way, how much they got each other, and how they care not only about their relationship but the ones they have with the rest of their loved ones was so beautiful to read about.

Das ist der beste Teil der Reihe mir hat es an nichts gefehlt, es war Spannung da, es war liebe zu sp√ºren. Es ist viel unvorhersehbares passiert und das Ende war ein Feuerwerk. Ich bin einfach nur begeistert. Mona Kasten hat mich mit einem weinenden und l√§chelnden Auge zur√ºck gelassen und ich bin dankbar das ich nicht nur √ºber Ruby und James, Lydia und Ember lesen durfte sondern auch andere neben Charaktere haben ihre Stimme in diesem Buch verlauten lassen und damit viele Emotionen in mir geweckt. Ich bin f√∂rmlich durch das Buch geflogen Seite f√ºr Seite und wollte nicht das es endet. Ich finde mit diesem Buch wurden nat√ºrlich Klischees wie liebes M√§dchen kriegt den b√∂sen jungen doch noch dazu weich zu werden verwendet aber auf eine herrlich frische Weise. Mit einer Menge an Girls power, LGBT und Mut ohne Ende. Ich hoffe es erreicht viele Herzen. Man kann und da nehme ich einen Teil aus Monas Danksagung, von James lernen das kein Traum zu Gros oder zu klein ist, von Ruby kann man lernen f√ºr dich einzustehen. Lydia kann Mut machen.

I loved the first book, but I don't feel the same way about this one.This book wasn't bad, but I felt like the story was just dragging on and it got messy and boring.Ruby and James's relationship was still going strong in this one, they learned to get through difficult times together and were there for each other. I still loved Ruby, loved how organised and strong she was at all times. She was still very goal-oriented and she didn't give up easily.James finally grew a pair and stood up to his father. He finally stopped giving him power over his life and I've waited for three books for him to do that.The thing that bothered me the most was the multiple POVs in this book. I got easily confused because so many different characters were telling their own stories that I wasn't even interested in or they weren't that important for the story and it felt like this was done just to fill the pages.This story just wasn't what I really expected or wanted. It wasn't all that bad, but it wasn't that great, either.""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Enth√§lt Spoiler zu den Vorg√§ngern!Rubys Tr√§ume scheinen zerst√∂rt: Sie wurde suspendiert, Oxford w√ºrde sie nicht mehr nehmen und ausgerechnet James hat diese Bilder gemacht, die sie in ihr Verderben st√ºrzen. Kennt sie ihn doch viel schlechter, als sie dachte?James w√ºrde alles tun, damit Ruby gl√ºcklich ist. Gleichzeitig bedr√§ngt ihn sein Vater, f√ºr die Firma da zu sein und seine Schwester Lydia hat ganz andere Probleme, denn ihr Geheimnis ist eigentlich keins mehr und auch ihre Welt f√§llt auseinander.Jeder k√§mpft f√ºr sein Gl√ºck, w√§hrend Ruby und James wieder um ihre Liebe k√§mpfen ...Handlung und SchreibstilIch hatte ein ganz grundlegendes Problem mit diesem Buch: Es geht nicht mehr um Ruby und James. An sich klingt das nicht so schlimm, denn nat√ºrlich d√ºrfen auch mal andere Charaktere zu Wort kommen, nur leider dr√§ngen diese das Hauptpaar vollkommen in den Hintergrund und wir haben drei weitere P√§rchen, die sehr viel Platz in der Geschichte einnehmen. Sie werden im Klappentext mit keinem Wort erw√§hnt und waren auch in beiden Vorg√§ngern nicht ann√§hrend so im Mittelpunkt, weswegen es mich hier dann so gest√∂rt hat, weil ich eben mehr √ºber Ruby und James lesen wollte und √ºberraschenderweise etwas ganz anderes bekam.Ruby und James l√∂sten ihre Probleme sehr schnell und taten im Hauptteil rein gar nichts, erst zum Ende hin kam bei ihnen wieder etwas Spannung auf, die auch wieder sofort vorbei war. Insgesamt pl√§tschert die ganze Handlung vor sich hin, weil im Eiltempo so viele Liebesgeschichten durchlebt werden, mit H√∂hen und Tiefen und doch sehr knapp, weil ja dann sofort der n√§chste dran ist. Ich fand es nach den deutlich st√§rkeren Vorg√§ngern sehr schade, dass dieser letzte Band durch zu viel mittelm√§√üig interessanten Inhalt so langweilig geworden ist.CharaktereWir haben nur Paare, die wir vorher schon kannten, v√∂llig neue Zusammensetzungen w√§ren dann wirklich zu viel gewesen.Bei Ruby und James kommt nur wenig Neues dazu. James findet langsam mehr Selbstvertrauen und wagt es mehr und mehr auf eigenen Beinen zu stehen, w√§hrend Ruby noch um ihre Tr√§ume k√§mpft, wie sie das immer tut. Sie ist sehr freundlich zu allen und ihre Verzweiflung macht sie nicht fies oder so. James wirkt immer nachdenklich und bedr√ºckt, weil er eine schwierige Zeit mit seiner Familie durchmacht und tut eigentlich nicht besonders viel. Das war es ja, was ich an diesem Buch so schade fand - bei Ruby und James ver√§ndert sich gef√ºhlt nichts.Dann sind da noch Lydia und Graham, deren Liebesgeschichte ich in diesem Buch eigentlich am besten fand, daf√ºr aber schon wieder zu kurz. Sie spielten schon lange genug eine Rolle, um sich auch f√ºr ihr Happy End zu interessieren und mussten ja auch schon eine Menge durchmachen, sodass sie es auch wirklich verdient h√§tten.Bei Wren und Ember sowie bei Kesh und Alistair hatte ich nicht so richtigen Zugang zu den Charakteren, weil sie bisher nicht so wichtig waren und mich dann etwas genervt haben, weil sie von der Haupthandlung ablenkten. Ihre Geschichten waren simpel gestrickt und konnten mich einfach nicht fesseln. Ember f√ºhlt sich von ihrer Schwester ungerecht behandelt, ist unsicher wegen ihrer Figur und will dazugeh√∂ren. Sie reagiert recht sensibel auf alles von Wren, der gerade sein Verm√∂gen verloren hat und sich an seinem neuen Platz noch nicht ganz zurechtfindet. Kesh kann nicht zu seiner Sexualit√§t stehen, womit Alistair nicht klarkommt, weil er richtig mit ihm zusammen sein m√∂chte. Hier wurden interessante Themen angeschnitten, aber es wirkte einfach zu eilig, um mich ganz √ºberzeugen zu k√∂nnen.FazitLeider muss ich sagen, dass ""Save Us"" als Finale der Maxton-Hall-Trilogie der schw√§chste Band f√ºr mich war. Nebencharaktere dr√§ngten Ruby und James v√∂llig in den Hintergrund, sodass die Spannung leider verloren ging und mich das Buch gar nicht mehr fesseln konnte.'}, {'rating': None, 'content': 'Ich habe wirklich keine Ahnung, wie ich das Buch bewerten soll.

Porque de nuevo, su padre quiere alejarlo de lo que ama.Esta vez James toma la decisi√≥n que siempre quiso, enfrenta a su padre y deja no solo la empresa sino su casa. Sin embargo, su padre a√∫n no tiene la √∫ltima palabra y si tiene que volver a Beaufort ser√° para proteger a quien m√°s ama.En ese √∫ltimo libro, Ruby y James vuelven a enfrentar situaciones que los quieren separar pero luchar√°n para mantenerse juntos.Save Us me gust√≥ por partes, hubo momentos que me hicieron suspirar, re√≠r y otros que odie.Lo que m√°s me gust√≥ fue que todos los personajes del libro evolucionaron en grande y resolvieron sus historias; Lydia y Graham, el profesor. Alistair y Kesh, Ember y Wren, Lin y Cyril. En mi opini√≥n tuvieron en cierta manera sus cierres justos.Tambi√©n me gust√≥ la lealtad en la amistad que se puede vislumbrar en este libro porque yo pensaba que James estaba con su grupo de amigos porque eran del mismo palo, por decirlo de una manera, pero se aqu√≠ se nota su sincera amistad y lo entend√≠. En el primer libro los tild√© de imb√©ciles que solo iban de fiesta y beb√≠an, y en los dos √∫ltimos libros es como que se ven como son, el cambio que ellos hacen.Me sorprendi√≥ el entendimiento y poder de perd√≥n que ten√≠an todos, incluyendo a Lydia cuando perdon√≥ al final a Cyril.Tambi√©n me sorprendi√≥ lo madura que era Ember y c√≥mo se manej√≥ con Wren, aunque me hubiera gustado saber c√≥mo quedaron ellos al final.Fue un alivio que los dramas y malos entendidos se terminaran para Ruby y James. Me gust√≥ que tuvieran algo de paz y verlos juntos sin tensiones. Lo de las fotos se resolvi√≥ sin m√°s y creo que era hora de que por fin Ruby creyera m√°s en James.No me esper√© que el padre de James hiciera lo que hizo al final. Pero yo rezaba para que James tuviera una salida de su tirano padre.No me esper√© el secreto de Cordelia y aplaud√≠ que Ophelia pusiera en su lugar a Mortimer. Que James y Lydia lo enfrentaran por fin.Save Us fue un libro que hablaba sobre tomar tu vida en tus manos y hacer lo que sue√±as. Vivir como quieres y hacer lo que te haga feliz. Fue sobre perdonar, aceptaci√≥n, crecer, enfrentar tus miedos, amistad, amor y confianza.Al final me dej√≥ con una buena sensaci√≥n, como que todos consiguieron un buen final.Si bien el libro no me vol√≥ la cabeza, lo disfrut√© y creo que me llevo un peque√±o recuerdo de la intensa y apasionada historia de amor de Ruby y James.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""4.5 out of 5 stars! ‚≠ê I must say that Mona Kasten could never disappoint me, ever! I‚Äôm too big of a fan of hers for that. The fact that the author decided to add even more POV's made me love the novel even more and this gave the book such a special feel to it. I have to say that I am pretty sad to say goodbye to the Maxton Hall crew, as I came to love them dearly whilst reading the trilogy. Ember & Wren's story would have been an awesome spin-off, as well as Alistair & Kesh's story. The latter were such a great couple and I would've loved to hear more about how they came about, honestly though their connection was so unique, I bet their story would've been great. üëçüèªüí•üß°So here is what the romantic new-adult novel is about:K√∂nnen sie sich retten? Oder werden sie sich gegenseitig zerst√∂ren? Ruby steht unter Schock: Sie wurde vom Maxton-Hall-College suspendiert. Und das Schlimmste: Alles deutet darauf hin, dass niemand anders als James daf√ºr verantwortlich ist. Ruby kann es nicht glauben - nicht nach allem, was sie gemeinsam durchgestanden haben. Sie dachte, dass sie den wahren James kennengelernt hat: den, der Tr√§ume hat, den, der sie zum Lachen bringt und ihr Herz mit einem einzigen Blick schneller schlagen l√§sst. Doch w√§hrend Ruby daf√ºr k√§mpft, trotz allem ihren Abschluss machen zu k√∂nnen, droht James einmal mehr unter den Verpflichtungen gegen√ºber seiner Familie zu zerbrechen. Und die beiden m√ºssen sich fragen, ob die Welten, in denen sie leben, nicht vielleicht doch zu verschieden sind ...I don't really get why the book has gotten that many bad reviews as it really just was Mona Kasten sticking to her own voice and her own writing style. Even though some twists were pretty foreseeable it doesn't make it an unsatisfactory read whatsoever. The greatest thing about Mona Kasten's stories is that they are about so much more than only a simple plain love story. I loved the positive note the book ended on and the main message the author tried to convey in her book which was that of self-love & self-respect and of course I adored James‚Äô message which basically said that you should never give up on your dreams, no matter who tries to keep you from doing so. üìöüòçüòç‚ÄúSobald man Dinge einmal ausgesprochen hat, gibt man ihnen Raum, in dem sie sich entfalten und echt werden k√∂nnen.‚Äù - 'Save Us', Mona Kasten""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3,5/5'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Es hat zugegebenerma√üen ziemlich lange gedauert, bis ich den letzten Band der Maxton-Hall-Triologie in die Hand genommen habe.

But her cool, aloof forever crush never really saw her before he moved away. Now that he‚Äôs back in town, Liz will do whatever it takes to get on his radar - and maybe snag him as a prom date - even befriend Wes Bennet.The annoyingly attractive next-door neighbor might seem like a prime candidate for romantic-comedy fantasies, but Wes has only been a pain in Liz‚Äôs butt since they were kids. Pranks involving frogs and decapitated lawn gnomes do not a potential boyfriend make. Yet, somehow, Wes and Michael are hitting it off, which means Wes is Liz‚Äôs in.But as Liz and Wes scheme to get Liz noticed by Michael so she can have her magical prom moment, she‚Äôs shocked to discover that she likes being around Wes. And as they continue to grow closer, she must reexamine everything she thought she knew about love - and rethink her own ideas of what happily ever after should look like.","[{'rating': 5, 'content': '‚ÄúEnemies-to-lovers‚Äîit‚Äôs our trope, Buxbaum.""4.9/5 :)~the actual soundtrack of Wessy and Libby~A rom-com with rom-com references, fake dating and enemies to lovers, all while the MCs are neighborsandchildhoodfriendsfrienamies??!This was like a dream come true.Acertain someonedidn‚Äôt realize why he was calling her Buxbaum until like halfway through the book‚Ä¶ and then they realized that‚Äôs her last name‚Ä¶totally not me~cons that I remember~Unfortunately I think this book just spoiled the entire plot of The Great Gatsby‚Ä¶Also, I wish the characters could stop thinking ""what the hell"", please.

The writing read like it was a not-like-other-grills YA contemporary romance from 2010, which, honestly, except for the year, is exactly what this book is.Ever since her mother died when she was young, Liz has been obsessed with rom-coms and finding her movie-worthy happily-ever-after. Enter Michael, the neighborhood boy she was (and still is??) in love with when she was literally in kindergarten, and Wes, the infuriating boy-next-door. One of them is going to help her get the other. You know where I'm going with this.Honestly speaking, it was painful to see Liz adamantly going after Michael even after a) it seemed like fAtE wAs TrYiNg To KeEp ThEm ApArt, and b) his most appealing trait was his SoUtHeRn DrAwL. Like, umm, no thank you? And then there's the fact that Liz hadn't actually seen him or talked to him since elementary school, but was still in love with him.Seriously. Liz is better at romanticizing her life than me when I have six assignments to finish for school and three hours to do them all.It was even more painful to see how she was slowly isolating herself from everyone around her, except Wes, and how somehow, in some way, most of her problems stemmed from the fact that she never really got any closure from her mother's death. That part might have actually been tragic, but it wasn't addressed very well until the end, and everything else was annoying.Specifically, all of her gushing over Michael was just not it. I was disgusted and cringing every five minutes, to the point where I had to pause the audiobook and do history homework to attempt to burn the scenes from my mind multiple times. It was not fun, to say the least.That being said, the audiobook was actually quite good. I think I would have jumped out a window if I was actually reading this book in text format, but somehow, the audiobooks narrator's ability was enough to keep me from taking such drastic methods of escape. The narrator was magically able to keep me at least somewhat interested in the happenings of the book, and their voice is one of the two saving graces of my reading experience.The only character I could really tolerate was Wes. Poor, poor Wes. I'm going to say it right now: Wes did not deserve everything that Liz made him go through. The dude has been simping after her since they were children, and agrees to help her get another dude just because he likes spending time with her?? Get this man a medal.And maybe a back brace for carrying the entire book on his shoulders.I won't deny that Wes and Liz's relationship was cute, but at the same time, while it was developed a lot throughout the course of the book, I never felt that we were given the outcome of that development. It was always very two steps forward, three steps back with them.There were a lot of tropes both used and spoken about in this book, and I felt that they were alright, but nothing too special. The plot in general was actually quite nice, the only thing that really ruined this book for me was Liz's character herself, and her inability to communicate with literally anyone in her life.Overall, I felt that this book had a lot of potential to actually be a cute and interesting, light-hearted story. Unfortunately for us, the main character makes you want to tear your hair out and then set it on fire, even if her love-interest is the human equivalent of cotton candy. I'll be honest and say that I was expecting more, especially from the MC, but if you're able to ignore that sort of stuff, I'd definitely recommend this as a sweet, quick romance if you're looking for one.""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'The star is only for Wes'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '4.5 stars‚ú®""Enemies-to-lovers- it\'s our trope, Buxbaum.""‚úîÔ∏è Enemies to lovers‚úîÔ∏è Fake dating‚úîÔ∏è Slow burn‚úîÔ∏è Banter and cheesy vibesY\'all am so glad I started 2024 reading this book.

I could go on but ultimately he was too adorable for words and such a book bfLizwas.. a teenager and a hopeless romantic like some of us. I adored her love for music and the playlists and her love for rom coms and how it solidified the bond she had with her mom as it reminded me of mines in doing so. But, I do have to mention being annoyed with her during certain points. delusional (aren‚Äôt we all) & oblivious at times with pent up teenage angst is how I‚Äôd describe her and while it bothered me at times‚ÄîI understood her. Her unresolved grief and fear of things changing molded her into how she was which isn‚Äôt an excuse but I get it. Thankfully she was self aware enough to acknowledge how wrong her words and actions were and worked to change that bc she could be so petty. When she wasn‚Äôt doing the most, her delusions had me cracking up bc I somehow related to them years ago lmao. I also tried to put myself in her shoes and remember being horrible at communicating my feelings at her age so I hope thecharacter development shown is expanded on further in the sequel‚ÄúDo you realize we could‚Äôve been doing this for years if you weren‚Äôt such a pain in the ass?‚Äùwesliz- all the teasing on Wes‚Äô end, the phone call scene, the late night talks in his backyard, the car scene (I screamed here) and confessing their feelings was the sweetest.

(asking for a friend)After reading this, I got myself every single book Lynn Painter has ever written. I think that says a lot about how much I loved this book.I‚Äôm a fan of romance books (how Wes would say it, I‚Äôm a love lover) in theory, but in reality, they rarely satisfy my needs. So, you don‚Äôt have to trust my other reviews that much, but my reviews of romance books‚Ä¶ I CHOOSE MY 5 STAR READS CAREFULLY IN THAT GENRE.This is considered a YA romance, characters are in their final year of high school, the events are set a few days before prom (15 if I‚Äôm correct). It‚Äôs very clean, our main couple shares a kiss or two. BUT, your needs will be satisfied. It‚Äôs all cute all fluff, the banter between Liz and Wes is written so well. The book is extremely funny, had me highlighting these little corny jokes (I laughed at them).Everything is told from the perspective of our main girl, Liz. She‚Äôs a lover of old romantic movies, which is a trait she got from her late mother. She rewatches her romcoms almost every day to sort of keep the memory of her mother. So, before every chapter, there‚Äôs a quote from one of those movies I used to obsessively watch when I was younger. Chapters were kinda long, ngl, I think the totality of this book (almost 400 pages) has less than 20 chapters (keep in mind that the last 2 were very short) + epilogue. Aside from these long chapters, there‚Äôs not a single thing I found uninteresting or dragging or cringe in this book. Reading some of the reviews for this book, I stumbled upon Liz hate. BUT I can‚Äôt really see why, to me, she was so adorable and relatable. Some of her weird behavior is easily justified by the situation she found herself in, the grief she‚Äôs going through. Both our love interests, Wes and Michael (a love triangle, not really, just read it), were very loveable. MICHAEL LOVES BRIDGERTON BOOKS, C‚ÄôMON! INSTANT HEART EYES FOR THAT BOY. And Wes has everything else. He‚Äôs funny, he‚Äôs supportive (that‚Äôs his best trait), he‚Äôs humble about his achievements, truly a superior male protagonist. BOOK BOYFRIEND OF THE WEEK! Even though Liz makes that joke a couple of times throughout the book, I still wouldn‚Äôt call this the enemies-to-lovers trope. There was this tiny fight around THE parking SPOT in the beginning, but it wasn‚Äôt that serious (especially considering the explanation we got at the very end of the book). So every little bad thing Wes has potentially done was for the banter, but definitely nothing major, this man is a WALKING GREEN FLAG (can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying that).Yeah, they couldn‚Äôt stay friends tho, never beating those allegations!!! üíï'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Maybe straight people aren‚Äôt so bad.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'this was not better than the movies'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""2nd ReadI love this book sm and I think it got me out of a reading/mental slump and I'm so grateful.

I feel very accomplished now.This book was basically everything I wanted: A book about rom-coms (there were quotes from rom-coms at the beginning of each chapter !!), an ENEMIES TO LOVERS, FAKE DATING, sooo much denial, and drama, drama, DRAMA.Liz is relatable in the sense that she's just trying to live life and garner the courage to ask out her life long crush and also she LOVES listening to music, something I relate to on a spiritual level. Also, you bet that I'm gonna be making a playlist of the Wes and Liz playlist shown in the back of the book. And she also loves rom-coms and SO DO I.‚ÄúI fell in love with teasing you in the second grade, when I first discovered that I could turn your cheeks pink with just a word. Then I fell in love with you.‚ÄùNow. Wes. I loved him so much, and he had me screeching MULTIPLE different times. He's the bad boy next door but he's also so sweet and kind, and not really a bad boy at all, it's just that he's portrayed that way because Liz despised him. I love him so much and I want him for myself.I also really loved the family connections in this. Liz had a slightly rocky relationship with her step-mom Helena, but I love that they were able to connect, and talk, and really get the chance to learn more about each other.The friendships in this were also GOLD. Joss seems like a great friend, and I can understand her frustrations when Liz was being a neglectful and sucky friend. Wes's friends were also really nice and sweet to Liz.Now, it was pretty chill through the book, but near the end, the drama just came pouring in and then I was reminded: Rom-coms are filled to the brim with drama. That's why I love them, besides the cute romances and cliche tropes that I just so happen to love.Also, Wes's 'big hands' were mentioned a lot. I mean, I don't mind but it was a little repetitive, if we're gonna get nit-picky.Liz's internal denial of her feelings was hilarious, and it just had me shouting at the book, telling her to just kiss him already!Also, I screamed at that moment in Wes's car.This book was also funny too: a lot of the lines made me laugh, and though it could be cheesy, cringey, and cliche, isn't that what you want out of a rom-com?I loved Wes from the beginning, and while Michael seemed like a great guy, Wes was just better.I will definitely be rereading this when I am either sad or want something cute, or just want to reread this.5 stars‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not you.‚Äù‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù‚ÄúShe.
