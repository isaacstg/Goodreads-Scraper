The Women
",Kristin Hannah,4.62,849943,716820,"Historical Fiction, Fiction, Audiobook, Historical, War, Book Club, Adult",471,06-02-2024,"From the celebrated author ofThe NightingaleandThe Four Windscomes Kristin Hannah'sThe Women—at once an intimate portrait of coming of age in a dangerous time and an epic tale of a nation divided.Women can be heroes.When twenty-year-old nursing student Frances “Frankie” McGrath hears these words, it is a revelation. Raised in the sun-drenched, idyllic world of Southern California and sheltered by her conservative parents, she has always prided herself on doing the right thing. But in 1965, the world is changing, and she suddenly dares to imagine a different future for herself. When her brother ships out to serve in Vietnam, she joins the Army Nurse Corps and follows his path.As green and inexperienced as the men sent to Vietnam to fight, Frankie is over-whelmed by the chaos and destruction of war. Each day is a gamble of life and death, hope and betrayal; friendships run deep and can be shattered in an instant. In war, she meets—and becomes one of—the lucky, the brave, the broken, and the lost.But war is just the beginning for Frankie and her veteran friends. The real battle lies in coming home to a changed and divided America, to angry protesters, and to a country that wants to forget Vietnam.The Womenis the story of one woman gone to war, but it shines a light on all women who put themselves in harm’s way and whose sacrifice and commitment to their country has too often been forgotten. A novel about deep friendships and bold patriotism,The Womenis a richly drawn story with a memorable heroine whose idealism and courage under fire will come to define an era.","[{'rating': 5, 'content': 'Don’t believe the lie if somebody insists that there were no women in Vietnam. They were there! They served their country, struggling with tragedies, PTSD, and casualties as well. But there was one crucial difference for them: they were never considered war heroes. Nobody applauded them for the sacrifices they made or awarded them medals. They didn\'t receive praise for their service, and when they attempted to speak about the psychologically consuming experiences they went through, they were silenced, as they weren\'t even recognized as veterans. This work is dedicated to the women who served their country both militarily and as civilian women stationed in Vietnam – heroines who need to be remembered, praised, and admired.This time, Kristin Hannah takes us back to the mid-sixties, shortly after JFK was shot in Texas. The country\'s primary focus is battling communism, and in pursuit of this mission, numerous troops comprising young Americans are sent to Vietnam.I highly recommend keeping some napkins, handkerchiefs, or tissues close by, as you\'ll need them during your reading experience. Another word of caution: don\'t plan anything extensive for your day, because once you start reading this book and tell yourself you\'ll only read a few pages before setting it down, that plan might not hold. From the moment you dive into Frances “Frankie” McGrath’s story, you\'ll become engrossed. It\'s almost as if you\'re under a spell – you won\'t be able to put it down. Her story will grip you, tearing at your heartstrings and evoking numerous tears, as you connect with her fears, heartbreaks, pains, anger, and frustrations. You can practically hear her internal screams and the words she\'s forced to bottle up because nobody wants to listen. She might be the most honest, poignant, tough, and resilient heroine the author has ever created. So, my advice is to clear your schedule, go with the flow, and allow the story to transport you to the jungles of Vietnam, where the echoing sound of helipads reverberates in your ears, and you find yourself in a hospital surrounded by young soldiers uttering their final messages to their loved ones.The book commences at a house party on Coronado Island, celebrating Frankie’s brother\'s enlistment. Frankie decides to take a break in her father\'s study, where a ""hero’s walk"" is displayed, featuring photos of the family\'s men who served in various wars. Now, her brother will be added to this wall. But why can\'t she be included too? It\'s in this moment that she realizes her brother\'s best friend, Rye, is also hiding in the room, questioning her: why can\'t a woman be a hero as well? This question alters everything for Frankie and challenges the life plans her family has set out for her. They expect her to marry and have children, conforming to the norms of the early sixties. However, she decides that she, too, can be a hero, serving her country and making her family proud, just like her brother did. She applies to the Army Nurse Corps to follow in her brother\'s footsteps.Her conservative and highly respected family doesn\'t support her decision, and when a tragic piece of news arrives unexpectedly, Frankie\'s life takes a sharp turn before she embarks on her earth-shattering journey.Soon, she finds herself amidst chaos and destruction, realizing that as a young, innocent, and inexperienced woman, she\'s like a fish in a bottle tossed into a dangerous ocean teeming with sharks. Within a short span of time, she becomes terrified, numb, and exhausted, navigating days where her heart breaks as she witnesses soldiers younger than her brother losing their lives and civilians becoming expendable amidst the chaos. As Frankie edges closer to collapse, nearly drowning in sorrow, her friends Barb and Ethel extend a lifeline, offering enough emotional support to keep her from giving up.The book takes us on a 20-year journey with Frankie, spanning two terms of her life as she struggles to save herself. She risks her life in the process, and upon her return, she realizes that she\'s not regarded as a war hero like the men who fought in combat. People avoid discussing the war, and even her own family treats her as though she\'s done something to embarrass them, something they\'d rather not acknowledge. During the day, she\'s compelled to blend into the community, resuming where she left off before the war, while at night, she battles her nightmares and the clutches of PTSD. She comes to understand that she\'s not the proud, ideal girl her family wanted her to be and never can be. Eventually, she gives in.Frankie\'s painful journey, marked by her substantial losses, her battles with addiction, and her anger toward those who betrayed and disrespected her, is portrayed with remarkable realism. You can feel her emotions; they\'re everywhere. You ache, you cry, you feel resentment, and you sigh. You experience every pain she carries as if it\'s a blow to your own face.She\'s one of the women from the war whose stories need to be told, remembered, cherished, and respected. Will she overcome her inner demons? Will she learn to heal from her pain, forgive those who worsened her suffering, embrace her flaws, and confront her fears that she\'s afraid to share with others? Will she ultimately find the peace she\'s searching for? Read her story to uncover the answers.I\'m still recovering from the impact of this book. My heart is a whirlwind of different emotions. While some characters may seem fictional initially, as you delve into their stories, you\'ll develop an immediate connection that makes these characters a part of you, lingering in your life indefinitely. Frankie is one such character – unforgettable, courageous, vulnerable, tarnished but not broken, poignant, and dependable.I believe this might be my favorite work by Kristin Hannah. After reading her closing note, I gained a deeper appreciation for the years of hard work she put into creating these vivid characters and crafting realistic descriptions of war zones, leading us on this unforgettable journey. This book will likely be one of the standout reads of 2024, and I consider myself fortunate to have had the opportunity to read it.Many thanks to NetGalley and St. Martin’s Press for providing me with a digital review copy of this amazing book in exchange for my honest thoughts.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology:medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter<'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Well, I am going to be That Person. That Person who does not rate the book everyone is raving about 5 stars. I just can’t. And here’s why…First of all, I do want to say that I very much appreciate that Kristin Hannah chose to write a novel about something other than World War 2. It was refreshing to read about the Vietnam War, a war about which very few novels have been written. Furthermore, I appreciate that she focused on the women. Women’s contributions and experiences in history are often overlooked and probably more so in regards to the Vietnam War. I, for one, honestly never thought about it.Secondly, Hannah does capture the setting very vividly. There are a lot of gory war scenes, you can feel the heat of the jungle, the stress, the exhaustion, etc. Similarly, she captured the experience of PTSD well (as far as I know, not having experienced it myself). I think it’s important to have this experience vividly exposed both for the sake of empathy as well as for those who have gone through it to feel heard and seen. She clearly did a ton of research on PTSD as well as on the war and the time period.So why not the raving 5 stars? Quite simply, because Kristin Hannah likes to jerk people around emotionally and because the romance in this is obnoxiously awful.First things first - and I don’t have anything else to say about this - I despise the title. Moving on…**A few spoilers ahead.**Emotionally, this book is seriously “everything but the kitchen sink”. Just throw in every tragic thing you can think of, it’s there. Just when you think something good might happen, nope. The tragedy gets almost repetitive and boring. Like, how many times do I want to read about wanting her father’s approval or about how cold her mother is? How many times do I want to read about her bloody clothes and the mud and men’s gaping wounds? How many times do I want to read about her drunken pill popping à la Valley of the Dolls? In a few cases, tragedy conveniently disposed of some plot points and characters which I found annoying. For instance, rather than Frankie having an honest conversation with another character, something traumatic occurs so she doesn’t have to. Do I get that the war trauma (both during and at home)was unending? Absolutely. That’s not really my issue. Kristin Hannah likes to pile on the tragedy and trauma in many of her books; it’s her formula and it gets tiresome after awhile.And the romance. Ugh, don’t get me started. I predicted basically what would happen every single time a love interest was introduced and I was right. She falls in love suddenly with no real reason other than feelings like “he brought her back to life”. Gag me. That’s not real, especially not after a 5 minute conversation. Why do any of these men deserve to be adored? I can’t see it. None of them were particularly stellar specimens. You can tell me these relationships were realistic all you want but I’m not obligated to like these guys or just gloss over the repeated adultery (that continues after the war). Hannah’s presentation of the romances is sentimental, cheesy and predictable. She does this in her books a lot. And I’m sorry but nothing will compel me to be ok with not one but two men coming back from the dead.This is a highly readable book and you’ll be turning the pages fast. I hope that we continue to hear more about underappreciated women in history (and this book did make me want to know more). However, I would have preferred less piled on tragedy and fewer contrived, sentimental plotlines.Pub date: Feb 6, 2024'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'easiest 5 stars ever!!! it will be nearly IMPOSSIBLE for readers to not love this book. Kristin Hannah is BACK and she has done it again 👏🏼🙏🏼😭❤️and to answer everyone’s question to me so far… THE NIGHTINGALE is my fave book of all time and therefore my favorite KH book. but… THE WOMEN is right beside it ❤️🙌🏼a full review is over on my IG, but my quick thoughts:💔 heartbreaking subject matter. very specific and real stories about The Vietnam War and also life post-war and what that was like for the Vets that returned home📖 the pacing is on fire. the first half of the book has you flipping pages so fast—the action is page after page after page. it’s 450+ pages but moved QUICK—i finished in 24 hours and could have binged it in one sitting if i had the time📖 Frankie is one of my fave MCs ever. she’s badass and flawed and tough and inspiring and emotional and an absolutely beautiful woman. she does some bad things but again, she is human and flawed and she is suffering📖 the female friendships and themes in this book will make your heart so happy📖 the research KH must have done for this book is INSANE. like so many other hisfic novels, it’s incredibly eye opening and educational. it shows you sides of the Vietnam War you probably have never seen or heard of before, and also brings things you have heard of to light in a very real way📖 the ending will ruin you in the best way. the tears were definitely flowing but i wouldn’t have changed a single thing 😭❤️❤️❤️👏🏼 i cried the entire last 10 pages. each paragraph hit me harder than the one previously 🥹😂😭📖 the love stories are very prevalent but try not to get caught up in them—it’s so much more than a woman and her love interestsin her author’s note she mentions how long she’s wanted to write this book but how she wanted to build the courage and strength to do the story justice and boy oh boy did she ever. as someone (like so many others) with a very close family member who fought in Vietnam… this really hits close to home. so much of what is explained and illustrated in this book is what really happened in Vietnam and how some of the veterans really felt and it’s heartbreaking and an important story to be told. it makes me want to be able to call my relatives and talk about what they went through and relive those stories again with them, but they are now at peace 🙏🏼💔THANK YOU to my friends at St Martins Press for gifting me this early. all opinions and thoughts as always are my own.i know we don’t want to wait until Feb 2024 to have this out in the world (i want to talk to everyone about it right now…), but i promise it will be WELL worth the wait.thank you, Kristin, for telling this story of The Women during the Vietnam War ❤️*EDIT: adding in my fave quotes from the book! 🚨 potential spoilers ahead 🚨❤️❤️❤️“Women can be heroes.”“No fear, McGrath. You can do this.”“Maybe happy now, happy for a moment, is all we really get. Happy forever seems like a shitload to ask in a world on fire.”“There are no women in Vietnam, dear.”“She needed to do as everyone suggested and forget.”“She was never exactly sure what she was ashamed of, jsut that she was weak, or had somehow done something bad, been a part of something bad, something no one wanted to talk about.”“We don’t really talk about it.”“The war no one wants to remember.”“Thank you for finally remembering us.”“You and me, McGrath. Finally.”'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Women can be heroes.4 1/2 stars.Kristin Hannahcertainly knows how to take a sledgehammer to your heart and she is NOT afraid to do it.Hannah\'s reads are so powerful and harrowing that I can forgive a few negatives, like here I think the major plot points of the story are quite predictable-- yet they still hit me like a ton of bricks, their impact not lessened by the fact I\'d seen them coming. Maybe this one was easier to predict as I\'m getting used to the author\'s formula. Her novels take us to vastly different times and places but she uses similar tricks to engage the reader. I’m not complaining: it works.This book is an epic on women in the Vietnam War. Hannah introduces us to bright-eyed and naive nurse Frances ""Frankie"" McGrath, who longs for a place on her father\'s ""Hero\'s Wall"" and so volunteers for service in Vietnam.It is an understatement to say she didn\'t know what she was getting into. Frankie finds herself in hell on Earth, struggling to help put together men who have been blown apart, watching Vietnamese children die from napalm burns, losing friends for a cause none of them even understand. Those sensitive to graphic depictions of injuries should steer clear-- as a nurse in Vietnam, Frankie witnesses some of the most horrific things in our world.""We\'ve developed the skills to save their bodies, but not their lives,"" Captain Smith said.But this is not just a story about the war itself. It is a story of a young woman\'s growth, aging impossibly in a short amount of time. Her friends, Barb and Ethel, keep her spirits up at the worst times, and the funny dialogue between them is a major highlight of the novel. She falls in love and this, too, gives her hope for the future.How could she go from red alert sirens and saving lives to butter knives and champagne?Only half of this story is set in Vietnam; the other half is about coming home and living afterwards. It\'s not easy to say which one is more difficult. There was no hero\'s welcome for those returning from Vietnam. Veterans were cursed at and spat on. Many were left with irreparable damage from their time in the war. For some, it was the loss of a limb. For many, it was the loss of something harder to explain. While psychiatric help began to be offered, it was typically for male veterans.As with several of Hannah\'s other books, she once again shines a light on the women who have been erased from history. The female veterans she spoke with for this book told her how they often heard ""There were no women in Vietnam."" I cannot imagine how it must feel to risk your life, sacrifice your youth and peace of mind, and be told that it didn\'t even happen.Another horrible, ugly, powerful book from one of my must-read authors.As well as graphic injuries, this may not be suitable to those sensitive to depictions of substance abuse andmiscarriage.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""Hot Take: This book would never endThe Women details Frances “Frankie” McGrath’s experience serving in the Vietnam War as a nurse. And her transition into civilian life.This book had no plot—it is based on one character. The problem is….Frankie isn’t likeable. She is an entitled, spoiled rich girl. She has everything handed to her, and her reason for going to war was to be on the hero’s wall and not wanting to work her way up at the hospital. Although she constantly pulls on her veteran roommates, she couldn’t be bothered to provide support to nurses that arrived after her. Apparently, she hasn’t heard of paying it forward.Hannah also never gets into what makes Frankie so unique, what makes her special, what drives her. What about her would the world miss if she was gone?My favorite author says it best: “Every sentence I write is surrounded by the ghosts of the sentences I could have written at that point but chose not to.” In The Women, I wanted to hear about the other servicewomen. After Part 1, it was time to transition to someone else. How did Major Goldstein, the chief nurse, get to her position and how did she cope with placing the nurses, determining their fates? Why didn’t we shift to Ethel and Barb and what happened before Frankie?Additionally, Hannah is far too verbose, leaving the reader to wade through needless paragraphs, inserting uninteresting details. Sorry, I just don’t care about the cheap motel especially at the end of the book. Not sorry.The foreshadowing is so heavy that the book becomes predictable, and there are far too many characters—all of them are undeveloped. The author did far too much telling instead of showing. Show us memories of Finley and Frances. Give us the backstory on Ethel and Barb. Don’t tell us. Show us.Although I greatly enjoyed learning more about the brave women who valiantly served our country, this book was a chore to read.*Thanks, NetGalley, for a free copy of this book in exchange for my fair and unbiased opinion.How much I spent:Electronic text – Free/Nada/Zilch through NetGalley provided by publisher2025 Reading ScheduleJan\tA Town Like AliceFeb\tBirdsongMar\tCaptain Corelli's Mandolin - Louis De BerniereApr\tWar and PeaceMay\tThe Woman in WhiteJun\tAtonementJul\tThe Shadow of the WindAug\tJude the ObscureSep\tUlyssesOct\tVanity FairNov\tA Fine BalanceDec\tGerminalConnect With Me!BlogTwitterBookTubeFacebookInstaMy Bookstore at Pango""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '2 soap opera stars.Too cutesy and romance focused.No one is more surprised (and disappointed) than me to be giving a 2 star rating for this much loved and highly anticipated book. I started this novel thinking it would be an easy 5 star read. My rating quickly lowered to 3 stars by the halfway mark and then slowly dwindled down to 2 stars by the end.This novel follows a young womans harrowing journey as a nurse in the Vietnam war.The main character was likeable enough, but she lacked any sort of grit or believability for me. She felt very surface level and cutesy from start to finish, giving the overall tone a soap opera feel. Unfortunately I do not enjoy cute stories, especially when it comes to historical fiction. The lighter tone of this novel made it easy to fly through but neglected to leave any sort of lasting impression on me (other than disappointment).When I read historical fiction, I want grit, heaviness, atmosphere, rip-my-heart-out emotions along with the factual detail. The only aspect I received from this novel was the educational component of learning about this time in history. It had some atmosphere , but my detachment from the characters had me distanced from the plot altogether. There was no grit or emotion to pull me in. There were a couple of heart wrenching moments, but they didn’t truly move or impact me in any way.Romance is a heavy theme throughout this book. Unfortunately romance is a genre I do not enjoy reading. The main characters’ love interests had me confused and distanced from the storyline as none of it was even remotely believable. I think most of my lack of connection is that I wasn’t bought into any of the romance pieces and this is an integral part of what makes the storyline work.I also found this book extremely predictable and very cheesy at times. My eyes rolled a lot in the second half. I predicted several large plot points in the second half which took away any sort of shock factor or enjoyment I may have received from those reveals. The author also included an extreme amount of hot topics, like she was trying to touch on too many things without truly fleshing her ideas out.Overall, this was a complete miss for me. I am thankful to have read it solely for learning about this time period but I received zero enjoyment from an entertainment perspective. I have loved all of this authors previous historical fiction work, so if you are looking for a gritty, heavy, impactful historical fiction book, I encourage you to read those before picking this up. Please note, I am the outlier with my thoughts so make sure to read the countless raving reviews before deciding on this one.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'If Meredith Grey served in Vietnam and came home…this would be her story.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Not enough stars to rate this book. I never could’ve imagined myself being sucked into a historical fiction but here we are. I am ashamed to admit I had no idea what truly went on. I feel like blinders have been taken off & the storytelling in this one is 10/10. Add this to the top of your TBR, you may surprise yourself.'}, {'rating': None, 'content': 'I have a beautiful big paper arc written by a writer whom I\'ve never read before, but I know she is a NYT bestselling author, and that her books are deeply loved.I open the book.The first sentence is:The walled and gated MacGrath estate was a world unto itself, protected and private.And I think: Gosh, isn\'t this a slightly uninspired way to begin a book, I mean, couldn\'t she have tried a little harder than to call something ""a world unto itself,"" which was probably a little on the clichéd side even before the first time anyone wrote it down?Ok, moving on, the next two sentences are:On this twilit evening, the Tudor-style home\'s mullioned windows glowed jewel-like amid the lush, landscaped grounds. Palm fronds swayed overhead...and okay okay that\'s enough, because my brain is saying: ""On this twilit evening?"" ""windows glowed?""...""Palm frondsswayed?""I\'m just talking about my own experience, here.Speaking solely from my own point of view, this writing makes me feel bored and irritable at the same time. It feels so bland. It\'s as if someone is slapping me with wet cardboard. It\'s not exactly hurting me but I want to get away from it.But: Should I care so much about the prose style? Because, maybe it\'s a good story.But I do care. I want to read a story that is written withcare.So, most people would keep reading for several more pages at least, even if they felt the same way about these first sentences--I mean, can you really tell anything at all from two or three sentences?--but for me I\'m already thinking that, if this is how a book begins--if the beginning is, indeed, the place where a writer must capture my attention--then I\'m done.And this is normally where I would put a book down.But this time, because I\'ve heard so much about this writer\'s books, I open a few pages at random, just to see if I can find just one sentence to fall in love with, anywhere, or some phrase, at least, that catches my eye.And I read:Frankie felt a heaviness in her heart, a sorrow that she knew would stay with her...Jamie was there instantly, holding her steady. She reached for his hand, held it, not daring to look at him...She looked up in surprise...He shrugged, as unable to find the words as he\'d been to process the grief...He looked at her a long moment...That\'s all I have to say about this book, except to add that clearly I am way, way an outlier on why I read, which is at least 90% for the sound of the language, for the jolt of reading a sentence that is both describing something completely familiar to my human experienceand at the same timeis said in a completely new and revelatory way, and whenever I begin a book that does not do these things, both of them simultaneously, I think of all the books waiting to be read, and I move on.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'In a Nutshell:Expected far more from my very first Kristin Hannah book. 😔 Loved the intent, liked the content, disliked the writing. This is, as is obvious, an outlier review.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Plot Preview:1966, Coronado Island. Twenty-year-old Frances McGrath, known to all as ‘Frankie’, belongs to a wealthy family of navy veterans. At the send-off party for her elder brother who has enlisted for Vietnam, someone tells her, “Women can be heroes, too.” This sparks a desire in Frankie’s mind to serve her country through the armed forces, something she never considered before.As the only corps willing to take a freshly-graduated nurse is the army, Frankie, against her family’s wishes, registers with the Army Nurse Corps and sets off to Vietnam. There, she sees the true picture of war, where every day is a fight for survival. But will this struggle end with the end of the war? With war protestors becoming stronger by the day, the Vietnam veterans might not be coming home to the open arms of their country. What lies ahead?The story comes to us in Frankie’s third person perspective.Bookish Yays:😊 The intent deserves credit: to focus on the women veterans of the war, to depict what women can do, even if they aren’t allowed to.😊 The war-related scenes are as gruesome as expected. Felt like I was right there in the war zone with Frankie.😊 The focus on the importance of and the struggles faced by nurses and the secondary treatment they are given compared to doctors.😊 The details about the mental struggles and health issues faced by returning veterans, which went much beyond typically shown in fiction.Bookish Mixed Bags:😐 Frankie starts as a great character. Even when she is a naïve fresher, she has the right approach towards her work. But as the book progresses, her decisions start turning more and more impulsive and short-sighted. I don’t mind books with unlikeable characters as they add a nuance of realism to the story, but in this case, Frankie’s behaviour, especially in the second half, was more frustrating than understandable.😐 The Vietnam war is not called the ‘American War’ by Vietnam without a reason. I appreciate the author’s decision to highlight even the American atrocities and the lies spun by American politicians. Though these negatives are not covered in as much detail as I would have liked, they are still enough to shed light on the truth. However, the depiction of the American troops in Vietnam is white-saviour in approach for the most way, focussing more on the medical aid offered by the Americans to the locals than talking about why the locals needed the aid in the first place.😐 Most war books stop at the end of the war without showing the aftermath. That is one aspect in which this novel excelled; it went much beyond the timeline of the war and shows the reception of the Americans to the returning veterans, and the protests. However, the depiction of these events seems a bit exaggerated. I am obviously not privy to what happened in 1970s America, but I find it hard to believe that not even one person knew about women serving in Vietnam, or that not a single person showed sympathy to Frankie’s mental situation. The author’s note mentions that women veterans often met with dismissal, but ‘often’ doesn’t equate to ‘always.’ The balance is missing.😐 Frankie’s downward spiral in the second half is, in one way, a good creative call as it shows us the darker side of PTSD. However, the events get tedious and repetitive after a while. Plus, the hyper-drama level is way too high in this section.😐 While there are some interesting secondary characters in the book, they barely get proper detailing. Most of what we know about their background is the little we get from passing references in conversations. Many characters disappear without a trace as soon as their purpose is served in the plot. The one I am most curious about is the senior nurse who greets Frankie on her arrival in Vietnam. What happened to her? There were at least three skilled nurses that we know of (Ethel, Barb, and the senior nurse), but we hardly get to see them in action. Why does Frankie have to be the one to save the day, every time? The character decisions also induce much eyerolling. Whenever there is a party, the nurses drop everything and rush off, without asking or informing anyone. How is that possible in the army?😐 For the first time ever, I, a big fan of author’s notes, have mixed feelings about the note in this novel. I appreciate the clarity the author provides about her intention behind this book and her research sources. Two issues, though: 1. She has no first-hand experience of Vietnam (which is very evident in her writing about its weather), and 2. She said that she wanted to change the place names and war unit details for ease of writing, but changed her mind only after veterans told her not to. I find it very odd that an accomplished writer of historical fiction even considered falsifying factual details just to make her task easier.Bookish Nays:😣 The writing was the biggest disappointment. This book is much overwritten. At 470+ pages, I thought we would hear multiple women’s perspectives and experiences in the war. But unlike what the title suggests, “The Women” is mainly the story of only ONE WOMAN – Frankie. Moreover, there is too much of telling in the writing. Every single outfit worn by Frankie and the others is described in elaborate detail. Actions are narrated step by step. Every now and then, we see the time mentioned in army style – “At 20:15” – as if to remind us that Frankie is now a military member. The foreshadowing is too blatant. One phrase that comes up multiple times is “How long had it been since…”. The worst of it is the character resurrections – yes, plural! The effect is repetitive and annoying.😣 The romance is cheesy and unappealing. Every single guy who has a proper role in the story falls in love with Frankie. We are expected to believe that this is common during the war time because of the low number of American women around, but in that case, how come Ethel and Barb and the other nurses didn’t have anyone falling for them? As it is, I don’t like romance popping in non-romance books, but it is even worse when the writing is so corny and the situations so lopsided. The lack of appeal in the male characters doesn’t help.😣 There is not a single Vietnamese character of importance in the whole book. Moreover, the representation of Vietnam is, as expected, focussed on the problems: rats, malaria, heat, lack of potable water,… Though the Americans enjoy water-skiing and swimming and so on in the local lakes, the beauty of the location is rarely described. The funniest to me was the finger-pointing at Vietnam’s monsoon for causing Frankie’s travel bag to stay musty and stink even eight years later. Sorry! But if your travel bag is odoriferous, it’s probably because you haven’t washed it, ever! Don’t blame the monsoon!🎧 The Audiobook Experience:The audiobook, clocking at almost 15 hours, is narrated by the inimitable Julia Whelan. Need I say anything more? Everyone who knows audiobooks knows that she is among the best narrators. If you still want to try this book, the audio version is definitely a fabulous way to check it out, especially considering its length.All in all, I do appreciate the author’s efforts and the intention that made her write this book. I even liked certain aspects of the storyline, and loved learning about the nurses who gave so much to the fruitless war. But the writing and the plot development were not to my liking. The problems are exacerbated in the audio version as it feels like an endless journey through monotonous situations.As is evident from the current rating on Goodreads, mine is very much an outlier opinion. Most other readers have not just loved the book but are positively gushing about it. So please go through their reviews before taking a final call. If you are the kind of reader who prioritises sentiments over plot and writing, you might love this novel way more than I did.2.25 stars.My thanks to Macmillan Audio and NetGalley for the ALC of “The Women”.

You can findaudiobook version here:""The Women - (Audiobook)There is also a societal aspect to the book that looks at the challenges that these women faced when they returned, fighting to be recognized and honored in a society that often devalued their contributions. The development of Frankie character and her bonds with the other nurses is powerfully hopeful and devastating.This book is perfect for readers who have an interest in historical fiction and will be particularly appreciated for those interested in hearing a fuller story of women during the Vietnam War. Kristin Hannah has written a truly meaningful tribute to these silent heroes, and this story will touch its readers in lasting ways.Not only is it a captivating story with strongly developed characters, but it also recognizes the value, strength, and resilience of women. Highly recommended.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '***HAPPY PUBLICATION DAY - ONE OF MY TOP 5 BOOKS OF 2023 ***There have been books written about some things that occurred in the 60’s – the music, the activism, the “summer of love”, the protests over the war, but this is the first book that I’ve read that has touched my heart so deeply.If not for a high lottery number, my husband would have been one of the thousands of young men who fought in this senseless war.Women have been largely ignored in most wars and it seems the same was the case in the Vietnam War (the Vietnamese called it the American war). The government misinformed the public about so much, including the fact that WOMEN WERE THERE TOO!Frankie McGrath’s brother has just enlisted and she decides to follow him, she enlists in the Army. Just out of nursing school and only 20 years old, she has no idea what to expect. She had lived a sheltered life on Coronado island, her parents were well off and she had an idyllic childhood.Once in Vietnam she is thrust into taking care of severely wounded men, horrible living conditions and a lack of trained staff. She is unprepared for what is ahead. She will not only learn nursing in extreme conditions but eventually taught how to do surgical procedures. Her base camp had one doctor and three nurses along with medics to care for the hundreds of injured men. Frankie came to dread the sound of helicopters approaching!!She is fortunate to have incredible roommates who will be her friends for life. She learns love and heartache, loss, anger and frustration.Upon returning home, there is no welcome, not even from her parents. After all of the parades and sit-ins to protest the war, no one seems to want to SEE THOSE WHO FOUGHT FOR THEIR COUNTRY.Eventually with lots of help Frankie carves out a life. She had to hit rock bottom before she got help. She struggled with PTSD, depression, alcoholism and betrayal on her path to a new life.The author states that this was a book that she had wanted to write for a long time. I applaud you Ms. Hannah for putting your heart and incredible research into this book.“Women can be heroes too” – and they so often are even though their voices aren’t always heard.I received an ARC of this novel from the publisher through Edelweiss. It was my pleasure to read and review this title.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I love books that not only teach me something but are thought provoking and evoke emotion. This book fits that bill to a ""T"" and then some. I don\'t think it is possible for Kristin Hannah to write a bad book. As with her other books,The Womenis well written, well thought out, and gripping. I was instantly absorbed in this book and had a hard time putting it down. I felt as if I were a fly on the wall, traveling to Vietnam with Frankie, and observing what life as a nurse was like during that time. The devastating injuries of the soldiers, the choices the medical staff had to make (who could be saved, who not to treat), the explosions, the living conditions, the lack of supplies and the relationships that were formed, left an impression on me.Frances “Frankie” McGrath was raised Coronado Island, California by her conservative parents. In the beginning of the book, she is a twenty-year-old nursing student living at home with her conservative, country club member parents. After her older brother goes to Vietnam, Frankie recalls the words of one of his friends“Women can be heroes, too.”, Frankie joins the Army Nurse Corps and after training, she is sent to Vietnam to work as a nurse. What she sees and experiences is shocking, traumatizing, heartbreaking and ultimately life changing. When not treating the horrifically injured soldiers, Frankie has formed close bonds with her fellow nurses. Bonds that will also change her life. Upon coming home, Frankie is shocked by being spit on, yelled at, and told repeatedly that women were not in Vietnam.I was shocked to learn that the Nurses who provide medical care to soldiers were not considered Veterans even though they signed up with the Army. That they could not go to the VA for help with PTSD. It was appalling and heartbreaking.Besides the beautiful writing, I loved how Hannah showed the strength of female friendship. How the women supported each other and formed a family unit amongst themselves. This was one of the highlights for me. They lifted each other up, loved each other, accepted each other’s faults, celebrated their strengths, and when everyone else was letting them down, they knew they could count on each other.This book also shows how PTSD affected nurses, doctors, and soldiers. How many self-medicated with drugs and alcohol. This book also depicts scenes of great bravery, political upheaval, war protests, the effects of PTSD, self-medication with drugs, friendships, family dynamics, sexism, and growth.The characters are fully fleshed out and feel real. I felt for them, rooted for them, and cried with them.Well written, gripping, shocking, and thought provoking.*Traveling Friends buddy read with Mary Beth#KristinHannah #NetGalley #StMartinsPressThank you to St. Martin\'s Press and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

Frankie is overwhelmed by the chaos and destruction of war as well as the unexpected trauma of coming home to a changed and politically divided America.Every time I open up a Kristin Hannah novel I get so excited. I have loved all of her books. This story is all about the women, the nurses in the Vietnam War. I think this is the first book that actually is about the women in the Vietnam War. It\'s about the women who puts themselves in harms way to help others. Women whose sacrifice and commitment to their country has all too often been forgotten. It\'s an emotional story.Frankie is so brave and strong and has dealt with so much death. Many of the women ended up with PTSD, flashbacks, and nightmares but they couldn\'t get the help that was needed like the men could.I loved all of the characters. They were all done so well. I loved the women\'s friendship. They all had each other\'s backs. They all were a good support group with each other. This was such a great book.I want to thank St. Martin\'s Press for the copy of this book.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Eeeek. This will undoubtedly be one of my most disappointing reads of \'24! I am baffled by all the 5 star ratings that it\'s getting.After ""The Nightingale"" and ""Four Winds,"" both of which were 5 star reads for me, I was really looking forward to ""The Women."" I started it immediately the day it was released. I was excited, to say the least.But ugh.The premise: Frankie McGrath is not your traditional girl, wanting more out of life than the traditional domestic roles. When the U.S. goes to war in Vietnam, her brother Finley, who is also her best friend, enlists and her parents are brimming with pride. Her father came from a ""Navy house"" and has a ""hero wall"" in their home where he puts up pictures of ""heroes."" His father was a veteran, and his own generation of men all went to war during WWII, but he was not able to go and overcompensated for his subsequent feelings of inadequacy by going overboard on the patriotism. His children are raised believing that serving your country is the highest honor. So when her brother Finley enlists & is deployed, it occurs to Frankie that as an R.N., she should follow in his footsteps. She winds up joining the army bc it\'s the only military branch that will accept her fresh out of college with no experience, she envisions proud parents, meeting up with her brother in \'Nam, coming home to accolades and a heroes welcome. Reality is nothing even close to that.So it started off alright. I am not particularly knowledgable about the Vietnam War so I figured I\'d learn a thing or two. Things escalate quickly. Before Frankie\'s plane even lands in Vietnam, she\'s getting shot at by ""Charlie"" & cowering in fear bc of all the loud, terrifying gunshots & explosions happening in the vicinity. She\'s quickly thrust into wartime nursing, exposed to death, missing limbs, & other horrific injuries within minutes of reporting for duty. There is no learning curve, there is no training, she\'s forced to sac up & buckle down & WORK.So this was as far as I got while still thinking that I would enjoy this. At this point, things started to go awry.Although the first strange thing I took note of was the lack of response when Frankie finds out that her brother had been killed in action & there were no remains. This was supposed to be her best friend and only sibling, the reason why she enlisted, the closest person in the world to her, yet her reaction to his death felt bizarrelyunreactive. Her family gets a letter, she\'s sad, takes a melancholy walk on the beach & that\'s basically it. For the way their relationship was depicted, the response felt disproportionately mild. I dismissed it as just a weird thing & would have been willing to overlook it had Hannah not proceeded to do the same thing over & over.And from this point on it\'s just one cliche after another. Enormous things happen abruptly and in a matter of a few pages. Frankie\'s responses are meager & fleeting. The fact that she enlistedforher brother & then lost him before being deployed is rarely mentioned, & when it is it\'s secondary & superficial, nothing but a quick opportunity to reinforce the supposed narrative that losing her brother actually meant something to her & wasn’t just some inconsequential event like it seems. Frankie gets to Vietnam & initially is seemingly shellshocked, but by the end of the night she\'s thinking about the dreamy MARRIED doctor with the ""sad eyes"" that whispered cliched reassurances & sweet nothings in her ear like ""Don\'t worry, I got you. You\'re safe."" She falls in love in a matter of a couple pages after a few of the most cliched wartime interactions ever, & then oops, he dies too. We got a page or two full of shrieking ""SAVE HIM!"" followed by obligatory sad moment w/her friends, but a few pages later there\'s a new guy whispering similar cliched things in her ear that make her weak with lust. It\'s instalovey to the extreme.The whole story moves along at breakneck speed, despite being mostly devoid of plot, with Frankie moving through experience after experience with banal, paltry one page responses, which ultimately just makes it all a bunch of stuff that happened to her that l didn’t really care about. Kristin Hannah just never gives ustimeto care.None of the other characters in the book have any depth whatsoever, they\'re all cardboard cutouts, stereotypical renderings of best friends & wartime lovers. Even the most heartbreaking parts of the story were rendered unfeeling because of how quickly they were moved through. There are various deaths & descriptions of soldiers/villagers last moments, at one point a baby is brought in that\'s covered in head to toe burns, barely alive, having been found in the arms of her dead mother. She takes her last breath in Frankie’s arms, & not even a page later it\'s on to the next thing. Which to be fair, one might defend by saying that’s just the life of a military nurse, where days go by w/lightening speed & there’s no time for despair. Which might very well be the case, but then it’s essentially just someone saying, “a baby came in with burns all over its body & died."" Yes, that’s very sad, but such quick descriptions hardly evoke strong emotional responses. A humanization needs to take place in order for me to extend any significant amount of empathy, mostespeciallywhen what we’re reading is fiction.The after the war half of the book was no better. Again Frankie moves through event after event, phase after phase with minimal depth. She comes home from war expecting elated parents & a revered veteran\'s welcome only to find that an entire country has changed it\'s outlook on the war—her own parents were so ashamed that they\'d concealed the truth & claimed she was studying abroad.Frankie tries to settle in. She moves thru the expected war responses one right after another, the behavior stereotypical & cursory, the healing process offensively unrealistic. (There\'s mention of bad dreams. At a party a firework goes off & she dives under a table & shrieks for everyone to take cover, etc etc) Eventually enter man #3 that more or less ""saves her.” She gets pregnant & then is spontaneously (but temporarily) healed. More of the typical women’s-problems-can-be-cured-by-marriage-and-a-baby-mentality, wow it can even cure PTSD!! But wait, oh no, man #2 that she thought was dead makes a stunning reappearance & she loses the baby from the shock of it. At this point all her PTSD symptoms reemerge with a vengeance, bc of course things didn’t getreallybad till there was a man involved. She realizes he’s married to someone else, which naturally causes her PTSD to escalate from something she had a solid grasp on to full blown PTSD with depression and suicidal ideation, and from there to an actual suicide attempt, which is proceeded by magically healing via get this...getting a place of her own in a location withwide open spaces.(Insert eyeroll here)Maybe if I had liked Frankie, like at all, I would have cared more about what happened to her but I just couldn\'t get there. A self proclaimed ""good girl,"" Frankie pretty much immediately falls into an entanglement with a married man. Her pathetic attempt at resistance felt almost like she was being coy more than it felt like she was experiencing any moral quandary. I know, I know, they\'re at war! It\'s a tale as old as war itself, the idea of a wartime dalliance, when the normal rules don\'t apply & the lives & wives waiting thousand of miles away back at home are inconsequential in the midst of a war where any minute could be one\'s last. I understand the logic but it’s still hard for me to wrap my brain around, bc personally I can’t imagine wanting to spend my final moments on this earth being unfaithful to the man I love, but yeah ok, I can acknowledge that I don’t know what any of that truly feels like, but Frankie’s dithering protestations were just so pathetic & absurdly fake, I couldn’t eventryto believe it.Especiallyconsidering she basically does the same thing not once, but TWICE. And we’re supposed to believe she’s struggling with attractions to unavailable men that are just so fierce that they are downright unconquerable?! Pffff. ""But...But... I\'m a good girl!!"" No girlfriend, you are not, not when you\'re knowingly f\'ing with married men. It\'s really not that hard to not, I\'ve come across plenty of married men that I have found attractive, but their marriage status is like turning off a switch. I won\'t go there, so everything else is irrelevant. I do not indulge the attraction. It’s pretty simple. In Frankie\'s case, she had no real principles despite believing that she did. She was a selfish, self absorbed simp, a supposed feminist who wanted something different, or more than the traditional domestic life, yet all she did from beginning to end is was fall all over herself for sexy men. I\'m sure there are a lot of Kristin Hannah devotees who enjoy and specifically seek her out for her personal brand of romance. Nightingale was romance heavy as well, but its steady pacing & other separate, unrelated plots made it all easier to get on board with bc it wasn\'t the only relevant storyline. And while in ""The Women,\' the romances didn’t exactly impel the nonexistent plot to it’s end, it was all still essentially a romance with a Vietnam War setting.The best bits IMO were the bits about the friendships Frankie made while nursing. Going through something as traumatizing as a war together has a way of solidifying relationships & bringing people much closer together than the average friendship. The way that Frankie relied on them & the way they showed up for her time & time again warmed my heart, but tbh even these parts highlighted how lacking the whole book was bc again, they lacked any substantial characterizations. We got no real backstories on either of the women, even the bits & pieces of their present lives were quickly glossed over. They were props, devices plugged in just to get Frankie out of whatever man-induced hole she was currently in. It also validated my opinion about Frankie being self absorbed & selfish, for all the support & love she’s given by these women, she gave almost none of it herself. For example, it takes her a very long time to be open minded about the cause her “best friend” has devoted her life to bc she’s too busy wallowing, & then when one of them gets engaged Frankie isjealous.Everything ties back to whatever is going on in her love life, it was annoying. For a book titled ""The Women” which supposedly was intended to be something that gave distinction & a voice to a group that history has all but forgotten, a lot of this was about the men.Historical fiction is not my favorite genre, but when written well (according to my preferences) they can still be some of my favorite books. But when I pick up a piece of historical fiction, I want to learn something about a time or a place or a people. Often after or while reading HF I find myself reading up on that topic, watching documentaries, searching out facts. Kate Quinn, John Boyne, Emma Donoghue are a few that come to mind that have consistently provided me with what I want in my historical fiction. What I don’t want is to read a romance within a historical setting. In “The Women,” reading about the experiences of a nurse in a time of war DID interest me, but it could have just as easily been any other place or time or war. Other than a few mentions of the heat & of “Charlie” one would hardly be able to differentiate between this & any other wars. It was ultimately a hollow construction of the war, a backdrop for the romantic exploits of our MC. I could have written this book with what little I knew about the Vietnam war. I got through just shy of 500 pages without learning a single thing. The title “Love In A Time Of War” would have moTo be fair, I didn’t completely despise this book, itwasreadable, I was neverbored. It was just that I had such high expectations & the result was disappointing. I have not read any of Kristin Hannah’s earlier works to know firsthand whether this is actually true or not, but I had gotten the sense that she had begun to deviate a bit from her previous chick-lit/romance with more literary work with ""Nightingale,"" and ""Four Winds,"" but it feels like she’s reverted back to her former M.O. with ""The Women."" (Which no shame to readers of chick-lit, some of it is great, but it’s just not what I was looking for in this instance.) Ordinarily I might have rated this 3 stars, but because my disappointment was so severe I had to go with 2. That doesn\'t mean that I\'m giving up on Kristin Hannah, I still plan to one day read the ""Great Alone,"" and I will likely continue to read whatever she comes out with.It is also worth noting that so far the reaction to “The Women”has been so positive that it leaves me feeling like I might be alone in my feelings about it. I’m getting the typical “what did I miss?!” feeling. To each their own I guess 🤷🏻\u200d♀️🤷🏻\u200d♀️'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'The Women was divine. Hannah’s writing has matured much like a fine wine. Each of her stories becoming richer, more complex, multi-layered.The Women is a tribute to the many unsung female nurses who served in the Vietnam War. Frankie, 20, has graduated nursing school and has enlisted. Although green, her nursing skills sharpen during her 2 tours. However when she returns home, the welcome isn’t a warm one.The brevity and courage these veterans had. Not only fighting for their lives over seas, but fighting for their own recognition at home amid a storm of protests and division. The sacrifices made. The lies told.Hannah masterly develops a character from a young naive girl, to a professional combat nurse, to a veteran returning home experiencing many of the symptoms men did- except many unaware women even served. Grief, PTSD, shame, addiction and healing.5⭐️ Hannah, you knocked it out of the park.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Another fantastic book by Kristin HannahI haven’t read much about the Vietnam War.. but, I was born in ‘58 and as a young girl I remember seeing the horrific video and images on the nightly news and.. fortunately for me.. I only knew of one older cousin who got drafted to go to war.Most everything we saw before, during, and after the war was about the men who were there.. of course it was the men who saw combat.. but women were there too… the nurses trying to patch up mutilated bodies, being alongside the dying as they took their last breaths..the women also endured a lot!This is the story of the WOMEN… a few of them.. mostly about a young girl Frankie, who after her brother enlisted.. she followed him and was a war nurse in the Army.I loved the story, mostly the first half that took place in Vietnam during wartime.So much about this story took me back to those days.. the riots, the political landscape, the war protests, the mention of certain songs.Wonderful!Thank you to Netgalley and St Martins Press for the ARC!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'In this devided world run by men , you can count on women.This quote felt like a perfect background for the overlooked story of the women serving their country in Vietnam. I for one hadn’t thought about the people who went there as nurses or other professions to help any way they could. I knew how important the war was when it came to recognizing how trauma can stay in the body and wreak havoc, and this book also showed how much society can make it harder to heal by not recognizing people who partake in war. In addition to being a convincing portrayal of war and PTSD, it was a love story that made me cry at the end. At one point I had to take a pause from listening because it was hard to process all the pain the main character suffered. When that happens, you know a story has affected you deeply.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'The Womenby Kristin Hannah is a Blend of Historical, Literary, and Women\'s Fiction!I\'ll be honest, I was expecting more finesse from Kristan Hannah\'s writing style and storytelling...The Womentransports the reader, along with the main character, Frances ""Frankie"" McGrath, to the Thirty-Sixth Evac Hospital in Vietnam, sixty miles from Saigon, within the first four chapters. By the end of the sixth chapter, I shed my first tears. This is an emotional read and, for those of us who remember those years during the Vietnam War, it stirs different memories in each of us...Overall, the pace of this story is slow, allowing repetition to sneak in. This is especially true after Frankie\'s return from Vietnam. Her homecoming was heart-wrenching but carried on, chapter after chapter, making the story too long. Perhaps the length would have been better justified if backstories were included for the primary characters. Very little to nothing was provided for any of them.Early in, the writing felt cumbersome and overly descriptive with flowery prose. The narration sounded throaty, stilted, sometimes monotone, and at other times exaggerated. The story had more telling than showing by the author\'s use of the story\'s narrative, rather than focusing on creative writing skills to allow the story to flow naturally. The writing style was my least favorite aspect of this book. It felt clumsy, overdramatic, and at times, snarky.This was an immersion read with a Kindle copy and an Audible audiobook, narrated by Julia Whelan.I love the female-focused premise and how the author allows the reader\'s imagination to proceed beyond the ending of the story. The story is emotional, true to the era, and well-researched. I cried, relived the memories and the music from that time, and appreciated the feeling of authenticity.The Womenhas many positive reviews and high ratings and I respect those viewpoints. As in all of my reviews, this critique is my honest opinion. Outlier Island, here I come. It\'s going to be a lonely place this time around...2⭐'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '4.5 stars rounded up.I was I high school when the Vietnam War started and I have to admit that I didn’t pay much attention until several years later in college when I found myself in a protest march on campus. I was more aware then or at least I thought I was. I had learned that a high school friend was killed there. The focus then was on the young men killed, the innocents of the region bombed, the insanity of the war. I never gave a thought about the women who served in the military as nurses, who saved so many, who experienced the trauma of seeing mutilated bodies, held the hands of those who wouldn’t come home. I never thought of the nurses who worked tirelessly under horrible conditions, who through their stamina and skill made it possible for so many to come home. Had I thought about them I never would have imagined that they would not be considered veterans. Kristin Hannah in this novel though the character of Frankie McGrath and her two best friends brings light and honor to the women who served.It’s a stunning read, not for the faint of heart, with vivid descriptions of the wounds and loss of limbs and loss of life. It portrays the grueling days and nights of these women as well as the doctors vividly. Their physical and emotional exhaustion and how they cope with sometimes heartbreaking effect. Frankie’s life after she returned home is heart wrenching. Highly recommend for those who remember the times and for those who don’t. It’s an eye opener that will punch you in the gut, but it’s worth it.I received a copy of this book from St. Martin’s Press through NetGalley.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Five stars with a minor quibbleIt’s a fine art to write a story that immediately immerses the reader in a different world. Once again, Hannah has done it with The Women. I felt I was right there with Frankie, a new nurse in Vietnam. My heart was beating just as quickly as hers, feeling just as helpless, questioning the decision that brought her there. She’s quickly forced out of her comfort zone, having to take on responsibilities she never imagined. Hannah gets the immediacy of the relationships, how quickly they become deep. But just as quickly dear friends are gone, hopefully because they’ve fulfilled their obligations. Other times, because they’ve died.I hadn’t realized how few of the nurses in Vietnam were women. She is one of only nine female nurses at the triage hospital where she’s initially sent. I also hadn’t realized how their very presence in Vietnam was denied. Frankie is repeatedly told “there were no women in Vietnam”.The second half of the story tackles Frankie’s return to the States. Again, Hannah does a great job presenting the PTSD, the failure to recognize her service, the protests, especially the Veteran protests. My one quibble was that the romance part of the story started coming across as more soap opera than real.This one grabbed me and never let me go. I was finding all sorts of reasons to continue to read/listen to this. I finished this 15 hour book in two days.The story is incredibly well researched. Right down to the little things, like nurses not being allowed to wear pantyhose with their dress uniform but forced to wear a girdle and hose. Or how prevalent rats were. I am curious to know if studies back up the idea that the Vietnam vets suffered more PTSD because their service, unlike other war time vets, was not acknowledged - that they weren’t lauded when they returned home, that they were forced to keep silent about their experiences.The audio book was narrated by Julia Whelan who did a fabulous job. She truly enhanced the story.My thanks to Netgalley and St. Martin’s Press and Macmillan Audio for an advance copy of this book.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'It’s perfect.😭😭😭😭😭'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""“The women had a story to tell, even if the world wasn't quite yet ready to hear it, and their story began with three simple words.

We were there.”The WomenbyKristin Hannahfollows twenty-one-year-old Frances “Frankie” Grace McGrath, a sheltered young woman from an affluent family, who enlisted as a nurse during the Vietnam War. The narrative follows Frankie through the years of the war and the decades that follow.There is a lot to like about this novel. The author writes with compassion and the narrative flows well. The fact that the author wanted to tell the story of the women who served in the Vietnam War, giving those whose contributions have been ignored a voice, renders this novel remarkable in its scope and intention. I loved how the author describes the camaraderie between friends and colleagues, their support for one another, the resilience, compassion and bravery of the women who served and the sacrifices they made. I also liked how the author incorporated the public outcry and protests back home - the mixed feelings about the war and those who served and the politics of the time - into the narrative. The author’s unflinching depiction of PTSD and how so many people could not find the help they needed to cope with the trauma they carried back home was heartbreaking was realistic and thought-provoking as were the descriptions of the horrors of war (some of which were more than a little difficult to read). Despite the story being set in years of the Vietnam War and its aftermath, the issues that she has raised are both crucial and relevant even in today’s world.Unfortunately, there are a few issues that prevent me from giving this novel a higher rating. I was invested in Frankie’s journey and was eager to see how she evolved from a privileged young woman whose sheltered upbringing could not have prepared her for what she would have to endure. The weak character development, the focus on her love life, and the stereotypical and slightly disrespectful representation of the men (with whom she gets romantically involved) who serve their country did not make for pleasant reading and detracted from the overall experience. The ending was poignant, but again, the author’s choice to provide a “happy” (melodramatic) ending lessened the overall impact.Both Ethel and Barb were well thought out characters ( in fact, I found them more interesting than Frankie). Though we do get to know their stories in segments interspersed throughout the novel, mostly through Frankie’s interactions with them, I feel the author has missed an opportunity to further enrich the narrative. In my humble opinion, focusing on one woman’s perspective and relegating the other characters to supporting roles, defeats the purpose of this novel. All three women, each with their distinct convictions and motivations, deserved to have their voices woven into the narrative. The perspectives of all three of these women from diverse backgrounds, each of whom embark on their respective journeys facing their own set of challenges, would have provided much-needed depth to the narrative.Given the strong historical context and the premise of the novel, I’d expected to enjoy this novel more than I actually did. Overall, while l did not dislike The Women, I can’t help feeling a tad disappointed with certain aspects of the story. However, many have enjoyed this novel more and I would request you to read those reviews before deciding on whether to read this one.Many thanks to St. Martin's Press for the digital review copy via NetGalley.

It really dives deep into how getting back into civilian life is not easy to do. She joins the protests. She tries to look for support, but gets turned away for being a woman and not having actually been in combat. Her journey to get her mental health in check is a long one, but eventually she gets there and uses her experience perfectly in the end.It was really hard to listen to her father disrespect her time and time again, but different times I suppose. The friendships she made with Ethel and Barb were ones to last a lifetime as they each know what the other has lived through. They'd drop everything to be by her side when she needed them the most (not sure how they were able to get to her so quickly, cuz it's fiction I guess).Overall, as expected, it was well researched, but I do think this could have been cut down quite a bit.Narration notes:A superb job as usual.

Despite some well-researched details, Kristin Hannah doesn’t seem to care as much about historical or cultural accuracy when it comes to writing Vietnam or Vietnamese people. It feels as if Hannah\'s research stopped at looking up stock images of Vietnam. Nothing too egregious but it definitely took me out of the story and created many eyeroll moments. (For example, Hannah assumed Vietnamese women only wore áo dài for every situation - working in the fields, carrying baskets of fruits, serving Jack Daniels in an American bar - they didn\'t.)The fast pace and melodramatic turn of events also force the characters to remain one-dimensional and rush the natural development and chemistry of Frankie\'s friendships and relationships. The ""telling instead of showing"" writing style is also not for me, so I had no reason to finish this sadly.*updated Feb 2024'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Five Standing Ovation Stars ⭐️ for The Women by Kristin Hannah! This book took my breath away. I can honestly say that I learned more about the men and women in Vietnam from this book than any other historical book that I have read. I will admit that the Vietnam War ended in 1975, when I was only two years old (I know, I just gave my age away), so growing up, I never really paid attention. Now that I am older, history interests me, and learning about the women in Vietnam took it to a whole other dimension.Our main character in this book is Frances (Frankie) McGrath. Frankie is very close with her brother Finley, who is in the Navy and goes off to Vietnam. Her father is so very proud of Finley, as all the men in the family are “war heroes”. Frankie decides she would like to be a hero too, just like all the other men in her family. As Frankie finishes her nursing degree, she recruits herself into the Army Nurse Corps and becomes Lieutenant Frances McGrath.As Lieutenant Frances McGrath, she is stationed in Vietnam as a surgical nurse. Frankie has two bunk mates, Ethel and Barb, who help show her the ropes and get her through some extremely rough days. As a surgical nurse, Frankie is exposed to mass casualties on a daily basis. She witnesses loss of limbs, gunshot wounds, head traumas, infections, broken bones, etc… Frankie also knows that she is the last person/girl that some of the soldiers will ever see. So Frankie takes photos with the soldiers, so their families know that their loved ones didn’t have to die alone.Frankie returns home after after serving two years in Vietnam. Her parents are ashamed of her, local citizens spit on her, she can’t find suitable employment. And the worst part? No one believes that a woman was in Vietnam! Her rages of anger and grief are uncontrollable, and no one seems to care or understand her.Frankie was told to just forget about everything that she witnessed, not think about it anymore, move forward with her life. But things weren’t so easy for Frankie.I learned some interesting and rather disturbing facts about the Vietnam War in this book. I know that they are true and a part of history, but some things are still hard to process. I don’t know how anyone can live through anything like that. To all the men and women that served- I commend you and thank you for your service!While this is a work of historical fiction, it is a book that I will not forget anytime soon. I highly recommend reading this book, and know that this book is moving into my favorite book of the year slot! While reading this book, I also recommend having tissues nearby- because trust me, you will need them. 😭I also enjoyed reading the Author’s Note at the end, and her Acknowledgments. Kristin Hannah told how this story came to be (and how long she worked on this), and also about the POW bracelet she wore in middle school. I also needed my tissues for that. So touching!Many, many thanks to NetGalley, St. Martin’s Press, and the author for an ARC of this book which I had the pleasure of reading. All opinions are my own.

I don't know how to express how much I loveThe Women! ✨I've read of how Vietnam soldiers were mistreated when they returned home. Never once had I read about the women who served in that war. Never.We knew about the lack of support the veterans received, the nurses in this story had none whatsoever. No one admitted women were serving in Vietnam.Frances “Frankie” McGrath wants to make her parents proud. After graduating from nursing school, she decides to follow her brother to Vietnam by joining the Navy. But with a two-year requirement, she decides to enlist with the Army which will send her to Vietnam after a short training.Little did she understand, that heroes in their family were exclusively men who served. Against her parent's wishes that she should marry and start a family, she heads to Vietnam ill-prepared for what's ahead.Part of the novel is set in Vietnam but Frankie's heartwrenching journey continues after her service. Ashamed by her family and broken by war. The story covers romance, tragedies, casualties, trauma, addiction, PTSD, civil rights, and women's rights. As with other returning soldiers, they are forgotten by all especially the women.I enjoyed listening toThe Womenknowing little detail when I started. Julia Whelan's narration was phenomenal and I highly recommend this audiobook.The story of army nurse Frankie McGrath will stay with me for a long time. No questionThe Womenis my favorite read so far this year and the best I've read by Kristin Hannah.Thank you Macmillan Audio and Netgalley for this ALC.14 hrs and 57 minsPublished February 6, 2024""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Kristin Hannah\'s upcoming release, The Women, left me in a severe love-hate conundrum. I can only give it three stars, an average of the five stars it deserves for the parts set in Vietnam and the one star it deserves for the backstories and romances.I loved the section of the book set in Vietnam. This part of the book was well-researched, action-packed, and took me as close as I wanted to be to a combat medical evacuation unit. Vietnam War literature has not covered the nurse\'s perspective much, so I especially valued this content. The Vietnam writing was gritty and sometimes challenging to read but written very well (trigger warnings for some readers, though, so be forewarned).However, the book chapters preceding Frankie\'s tour in Vietnam were slow and plodding. Frankie seemed devoid of personality - a cardboard caricature of ""the good girl."" I came close to DNFing the book before it even took off. The last half of this overly long book covered Frankie\'s return home and her struggles with PTSD. Aspects of these sections had decent content, covering the abysmal treatment of returning vets, the complete dismissal of women serving in combat zones, and the range of issues Vietnam Vets had adapting to life back home.All good, but then there were the intertwined romances and backstories, and these were, in my opinion, just horrible. I\'ve watched soap operas with more feasible plot lines. I don\'t want to include spoilers, but there were way too many times I rolled my eyes in dismay. It wasn\'t even that the romance aspect was too swoony (people familiar with my reviews know I have a low tolerance for swooniness), but the plot devolved into the ludicrous. The ridiculousness of some of the events in Frankie\'s relationships detracted from the seriousness of the rest of the story. Given the book was almost 500 pages long, much of this could have (should have) been edited out.Some details in the book\'s second half would have benefitted from better research. As written, they detracted from the good parts of the story and came off as just plain lazy. It\'s small stuff, but it piled up and was sometimes so frustrating I wanted to give up reading. Here are a few of my issues (that won\'t give away the plot). First, one nurse friend wants to be a veterinarian. OK, good for her, but in the late 1960s, few women were getting into vet school and, indeed, were mostly blocked from becoming large animal vets as this woman aspired to (I am a veterinarian, and vet school did not open broadly to women until the early 1980s). So this friend comes home from her tour in, I think, March and enrolls in vet school during the middle of the school year because, of course, a nurse can just do that without taking any prerequisites or entrance exams or even applying. Then this same friend, more than once, drops everything, including vet school, to fly out at the last minute and spend weeks helping Frankie, who is dealing with one melodramatic romantic crisis after another. Because you can do that in the middle of vet school with no apparent repercussions. This isn\'t the vet school I remember. And what regular folks just flew around the country on a whim in the 1960s? Flying was a big deal then, not done on a day\'s notice. Later in the book, a character living in rural Montana decides to become a clinical psychologist and does so while living in rural Montana because they have so many clinical psychology programs (yes, this is sarcasm).I understand I am an outlier here, but I\'m also not alone in my criticisms of the non-Vietnam aspects of the novel. You\'ll enjoy the book if melodrama, lack of historical accuracy, and telenovela-level romances don\'t bother you.Thanks to NetGalley for providing me with an eBook version of the novel in return for a review.'}]"

Makes you feel hopeful rather than making you want to crash and burn everything in your line of sight lmao.*I’m sorry in advance bc this review is gonna be gigantisaourus*wags brows* do you see what I did there?It’s been ages since I’ve loved all the MCs in a book so I deserve to go crazy on the fangirling, leave me alone 🙏This book. THIS BOOK- It gives you EVERYTHING you crave in romantasy. The drama, the characters, the plot, the action, the betrayal, the romance, the tension, THE HOPE THAT THERE ARE STILL AMAZING BOOKS OUT THERE IN THE WORLD-AND IT JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER-There is not a single dry page. Not one. It constantly stimulates your imagination. And there aren’t the usual boring unnecessary bs conversations happening, they’re almost always full of banter and in every chapter, something is happening. It’s fast-paced and that’s something I ADORE about this book.BUT CAN WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE FUCKING TENSION PLS??The addictive chemistry between XadenVi will chew you up, eat you alive and then shit you out, effectively altering the composition of your DNA forevermore😩❤️\u200d🩹The dialogue in this book is so yummy istg I was always giggling and kicking my feet whenever the MCs would interact 🤭💗🦋 they’re both sarcastic funny smart and complement each other sm.

There’s a perfect amount of every aspect in this book, I’ll never be able to get over it.While reading, it leaves you feeling as though you’ve lost a limb whenever you have to remove yourself from the book to carry out the most trivial inconvenience like feeding and hydrating yourself 😤🔪I'm telling you this book is the only sustenance I need to keep me alive 🙏Violet is me. I am Violet. We are one.No bc she is the most relatable character I’ve read in a long ass time. The way she is so reasonable, empathetic and HAS INTEGRITY. She’s not a pushover. She knows her mind and isn’t afraid to speak it when she feels the need to. There’s no ‘my body is betraying me’ bullshit. Not in this house. I’m in LOVE with violet sfmmm. She owns her feelings and demands what she’s owed. And when Xaden challenges her but she takes it as an incentive to poke and tease him back tenfold is ✨💗🦋🤌Watching her grow and become stronger was one of the most satisfying things about this book. Her character development was elite. She never changed her morals but she always adapts and moves on quickly and I cannot stress enough hm I love that about her.There wasn’t a single moment where I was annoyed at her for being hardheaded. She’s strategic but also carefree. She behaved like a normal 20-year-old would, not older/younger.XADEN is such a seductive menace but he’s MY precious seductive menace.He's always up for a challenge and he SERVES every freaking time. I love everything he has to say. He’s such a lil softy when it comes down to it. Him showing his love through his actions and constantly challenging Vi to do better??It’s the way he never coddles her but also shaves years off his life, worrying about her safety for me 🥹💗🙏😩🦋💞✨🧸I’m always waiting on hands and feet for any interaction with him whether it be his glares 🤭theirnot so shortglances across the classroom 💞his sarcastic quips 💅him being a brooding surly grump😩him being lethally calm 👑him obsessed with her every move 🙏💗Him telling her not to look at him like that bc he only has sm restraint??🤌❤️\u200d🔥 (I have to note that Lance did it better sksksksk) BUT EVERYTHING HE DOES IS HOT PLS-The way I fell for him the first moment he was described?? Everyone is saying how he’s like this guy or that guy from this book and that and I’m just here like idc if he was an amalgamation of every MMC I love?? I DONT CARE BECAUSEIT MADE ME LOVE HIM EVEN MORE👏 I respect Rebecca for plucking the best traits of every fantasy MMC, like don’t be shy put some more 💀✋And there are the dragons but all you need to know is that each one has their personality. They rule themselves. They're the real legends here. And the way this author has weaved them into the book is just MWAH *chefs kiss*The found family in this book is the most precious thing ever.I loved to read how they’re bonded together and I can see that each relationship has the potential to grow into something really special ugh I cannot wait for the next books 😩OkaySPOILERS ahead!!bc your girl gotta scream <33---When Tairn came out of wherever tf he was hiding I was screaming and legit shaking from the adrenaline. I’m still having a hard time accepting how good this book is! I thought she would only get Andarna and I was kinda disappointed bc the moment Tairn got mentioned in that lesson I JUMPED ON THE IDEA OF HIM SO FAST YOU DONT UNDERSTAND. But when he came to save her and Goldie AND THEN SPOKE TO HER IN HER MIND?? I BROKE DOWN AND HOWLED. SO. FUCKING. LOUD.And then Andarna was like “TELL HER MY NAME AS WELL” and I’m- *passes out from yelling so much*I LOVE ANDARNA SFMMM SHES THE MOST ADORABLE CUTE LITTLE SUNSHINE IVE EVER HAD THE PLEASURE TO READ ABOUT 🥹🫂💗😫💞🧸 The light of my life I’m telling you. she must be protected at all costs. (But omg at the end Xaden was like Goldie’s gone huge and I’m here like oop- I NEED TO SEE HER RFN)I love how Tairn is a dad adjacent to Violet 🙏 he’s my grumpiest overprotective pookie 🤭💗with STRONG feelings for his mate skskdhjd (I’m kinda jelly of Sgaeyl ngl)ALSO HOW FUCKING DARE YOU REBECCA!! You ripped my heart out of my chest, gave it a thousand paper cuts and flung it into a volcano for good measure. Liam's death BROKE me🔪 I cried too many fat ugly tears 😭 it was unbearable *shaky breath* but when XADEN found out and cried the cry of all cries?!? Me: (;´༎ຶٹ༎ຶ`) X 100And the fact that her brother is alive made me do a lap around my garden from sheer satisfaction bc I WAS FUCKING RIGHT. 15% in I guessed that he would be alive but he’ll be part of the “wrong” side of the war and it’s been kept a secret bc of the shame/treason and AHHH *does cheerleader flip and cartwheel*And Dain?? That pussy ass lil BITCHHHH- I wasn’t born with enough middle fingers to let you know hm I feel about him. He’s basically Adam from shatter me, and fml bc my reread is just gonna be me wanting to rip his spine out and strangling him w it whenever he speaks 😃🔫But when that inntinnsic called his every thought out to the crowd it was the most hilarious shit ever pls 💀 he’s so pathetic.SPOILERS OVEROne thing I have to say is that this book is not perfect. The action aspect of the book gets a LOT better towards the end imo but the start was a little rusty and needed some finesse but idc idc I’ll take it, faults and all.

The dragons make sure of that.❞In the beginning, Karen aka General Sorrengail, forces Violet to join Rider\'s Quadrant, a place where people become riders and form bonds with dragons.This is in contrast to Violet\'s original plan of following her father\'s path and becoming a scribe, responsible for documenting history. This makes her feeling angry and fearful because the decision is up to her mother, and she has no choice but to agree. She wasn\'t mentally or physically prepared for this challenge and have to do anything to survive.╰┈➤ VIOLET SORRENGAIL AKA VIOLENCE:❝You look all frail and breakable, but you’re really a violent little thing, aren’t you?❞Despite dealing with a chronic illness (ehler\'s danlos syndrome) and having weak joints, she was incredibly awesome and strong! Her personality was so relatable that I felt connected right away.Her anxieties and fears during challenges in the rider\'s quadrant, and how she conquered them with her smarts, were truly inspiring. She showed that knowledge is real power! Her rollercoaster of emotions—fear, anger, desire, happiness—kept me amazed.Even when teased and called weak, she never let anyone walk all over her. And fr, I didn\'t even get that \'oh I\'m so tiny and frail\' or the \'pick me vibes\' as mentioned somewhere because she actually had a illness.I would\'ve dashed for the hills (or the scribe quadrant in Violet\'s situation) when every single cadet was dead set on killing me!It was like half luck, and 25% thanks to the dragon scale corset, and another 25% to Violet\'s intelligence that kept her alive!And - wait XADEN PROTECTED HER WELL TOO! 🤭❝What I lack in strength, I make up for in speed.❞— She kept training and had a lot of improvement and her skills with the daggers were impeccable! landing straight on the target.╰┈➤ XADEN RIORSON:❝Stay the hell away from Xaden Riorson.❞Fantasy men are just FINE AF! From the beginning, he exudes a mysterious aura. Despite the stern lines on his face and a SCAR ON HIS LEFT BROW 🥵, he exudes both danger and allure.His character captivates me so deeply that even if I hadn\'t known he was the mmc, I would have rooted for him.fuck Dain.Xaden comes across as grumpy and ruthless, concealing his emotions behind a stoic facade.However, his interactions with Violet reveal a thoughtful, kind, and trusting side that filled me with so many emotions. It\'s this side of him that I adore. 💞He holds the position of the wing leader of FOURTH WING with great authority. His intelligence and power are remarkable, and don\'t even get me started on the way he walks, talks, and smirks – it leaves me utterly on my knees for him!🧎\u200d♀️His character possesses incredible depth, and I would\'ve loved to have his POV.He\'s a shadow wielder, and just by imagining the shadows around him, his rebellion relic, and his scar — I feel something inside of me! 😮\u200d💨REBECCA ADDED EVERY QUALITY TO MAKE HIM THE HOTTEST CHARACTER! 🤭— Ruthless who? He\'s such a softie....🔪 gave Violet training for sparring matches.🔪 made a saddle for her to be seated on her dragon.🔪 made a custom dagger for her.🔪 killed a room full of cadets who tried to kill Violet, just by using his shadows.🔪 took care of her when she was hurt.🔪 punished a wing leader who tried to kill Violet.╰┈➤ DRAGONS:—So the most sarcasticpersoncreature award goes to TAIRN!🫡God, how much I loved this grumpy broody dragon! He was one of the deadliest and strongest dragons, and he was bonded with none other than Violet! 🤭 His remarks were so sarcastic and savage, and the way he always scoffed and knew about her feelings for Xaden.

I loved how optimistic and innocent she actually was and possessed great powers, but she was only 2 years old! And the fact that she\'s also bonded with Violet 🥺Sgaeyl:We didn\'t get much about her, though hopefully in the next book, but I\'m so glad she and Tairn are bonded mates! GOD SHE HAS A BRILLIANT TASTE IN MEN. 🥵— ENEMIES TO LOVERS WHERE HE WANTS TO KILL HER? *Sign me up*❝He’s a third-year, and he will kill you the second he finds out who you are.❞Xaden is the son of Fen Riorson, known as THE GREATEST TRAITOR due to his leadership in a rebellion group. Sadly, this resulted in the execution of all rebel group members in front of their children, who were then marked with a relic symbolizing the rebellion.These children were forcibly placed into the Rider\'s Quadrant, where they faced the challenge of survival. The overseeing figure during these executions was none other than General Sorrengail (Violet\'s mother),so they\'re enemies, and he\'s the one who\'s gonnakillhandle her.🤭The enemies-to-lovers approach in this book was really well done.It felt very realistic and stayed true to the idea that \'children shouldn\'t be punished for their parents\' mistakes.\' The kids marked by the relic understood this, and Violet did too. What I especially liked was how Xaden and Violet\'s relationship grew naturally without being burdened by guilt from their pasts.Even though they weren\'t enemies for very long, the book didn\'t rush their journey to becoming lovers. Instead, it skillfully portrayed the gradual development of trust, as well as their decision to let go of their desires, leading them to eventually fall in love. ♥️Violet was super confused by Xaden\'s behavior. Rather than harming her, he encouraged her and saw her potential. He treated her as strong, not fragile, which both confused and intrigued her. 😉❝Going for blood today, are we, Violence?❞After Threshing (where the cadets were bonded with dragons), Violet discovered that Tairn, her dragon, was actually the bonded mate of Sgaeyl, Xaden\'s dragon. This connection tied the four of them together, and if one of them died, they all would. This meant Xaden couldn\'t consider killing her anymore, (not that he had intended to in the first place.) 🥹THE SEXUAL TENSION WAS TENSIONING.🥵 The sexual tension between them was incredibly strong! The heated lust-filled stares, locking eyes, proximity on mats, and more, yet neither wanted to act on it. Their first kiss was incredibly passionate and I was so giddy at that time. There were 3 graphic scenes but Damn they were HOT AF! 🫣🔥❝I am annoyingly aware of everything you do.❞NOT THEM SHATTERING WINDOWS, BREAKING ARMOIRES AND CHAIRS, BURNING CURTAINS AND FORESTS WHILE DOING ✨IT✨.╰┈➤ SIDE CHARACTERS:Rhiannon and Rodic:They were literal babies and I loved how both of them supported Violet! Idk when and how Rodic made his place in my heart but he was so cute. Always adopting humor for every situation and was so calm hehe! 🥺 Am I the only one who wants them together?Like who Tara, Sawyer, or whatever his name is, just give Rhi and Rodic.Sawyer, Imogen, Bodhi, Garrick, Emery, Heaton:I loved how they all became a squad and clearly I would love more of them!Mira Sorrengail:This badass cutie, sexy hot, I love her! 🥵 She\'s so fierce and the best sister ever! 💞Liam Mairi:WE WERE ROBBED OF HIM. I WILL NEVER EVER FORGET HIM, please he was so precious. 🥺😭 I literally cried so much when he died! I already had a feeling that he might die, but god it was so painful. I was so badly hurt when he died. It was so painful to see him dying and then Xaden calling him Brother. My heart broke! I\'m never forgetting that piece of shit Dain.Dain Aetos:This bitch, this traitor, this asshole, what the fuck! Why did he have to go and pull a full traitor-Adam-Kent behavior like bitch fuck off??I actually reasoned with him in the start and ignored him because he was just there to discourage Violet and gaslight her again and again by using \'best friend\' but he so skillfully and fucked-uply betrayed her.IF HE DIDN\'T READ VIOLET\'S MEMORIES (by touching her face) and then not telling his father, LIAM WOULD BE FUCKING ALIVE. FUCK OFF, DAINNN. I WISH YOU GET SCORCHED BY TAIRN! 🤢❝Stop. Fucking. Coddling. Her.❞— yeah, bitch, get that!Jack Barlowe:He was a piece of shit just like Dain and I\'m glad he was Violet\'s first kill, haha served him right! I don\'t want to give him more importance; he was shit AF! His death was so satisfying 😗🤝🏻Long-haired Luca and Traitor Tynan getting scorched was the best thing.General Sorrengail:I dislike her already and I know I\'ll loathe her in the next books, but the only good thing was she trusted that Violet is capable of becoming a rider.Syrena (Flier):She\'s a gryphon rider and had only 2 scenes, but I wish we get to see her in the next books!— some other things:1. I literally choked on my laugh when I read about how smartly Violet won all the sparring matches because she poisoned every player with different types of herbs during the match, and her choosing the breakfast duties to add the poisons in their lunch was such a badass move!It\'s truly proven by Violet that knowledge is power.2. When Dylan died, my heart just stopped for a moment, and I was so horrified when Aurelie died! (Guess I\'m just going to grieve for Liam baby now.)3.All the challenges gave me Squid Game vibes, like all those tasks just to survive and so many deaths each day!Ugh, It was so fun yet horrifying to read. 🤧4.""Fuck, that stubborn, feisty look always makes me want to kiss you.”— these beautiful words!!?? 🤭5. I seriously don\'t even understand how Violet blocked the pain out and got so many stitches every month! I\'d already be on my deathbed 😂6. Am I the only one who couldn\'t — even after reading 3 times — imagine the GAUNTLET scene???? like WTH WAS THAT 😭7.MY TOXIC TRAIT IS THAT I THINK I WOULD\'VE KILLED THE VENIN IF I WERE IN VIOLET\'S PLACE (wth? 💀💀)8. I had doubts about Venins and Wyvern from the start, and gosh, they were horrifying AF!If we want anything to be real, IT\'S FICTIONAL MEN, not these ew!9. GOD, THE END? I\'m still shocked 🥲whjwhsha, I love this book!

We are not asking for a Tolkein level of originality, but if you cannot even come up with your own character description and had to take the literal description from other books (among others) then why are you even called an author?4- in a world that is coming soon to be drowned with AI movies and clips and pictures, I do not want to read an AI book. and I do not mean that the author used AI (Although at this point no one knows), I mean the copy, paste, and stitch from other booksother than that, knock yourself outThe sad reality is this book will probably be GR best fantasy of 2023 though it has NOTHING of the fantasy elementsIf I wanted to read cheap immitation of every other fantasy book then this book it is 😡😡😡😡every time I have an atom of hope that there is something 0.0000001% original, someone casually points out that it\'s not!IMPORTANT NOTE FOR READERS AT THE ENDIs this the future of books? writers shamelessly taking others\' work without even bringing their own to the table and the unknowing masses cheering them on!by now, this has become a game of ""SPOT THE COMMON, AND FIND THE DIFFERENCE""this book does not deserve an ounce of respect and this came after confirming that even the main characters\' descriptions are literally takenPLEASE STOP SAYING THAT NOTHING IS ORIGINAL ANYMORE! YEAH? PROVE ITAND EVEN IF THIS IS TRUE, IF A WRITER FAILS TO BRING AT LEAST 20% ORGININALITY ONTO THEIR BOOK, DO THEY DESERVE TO BE CALLED WRITERS???It is one thing to sample an idea or concept from ""a book"", it is another to take the whole storyline and plot from ""a book"" or in this case ""books"" and make it your own.This book is a memory quiltMade from old stuff to look newIt takes everything that we know as familiar, comfort and nostalgic and weave it together to present it as something new giving you a FAKE sense of enjoymentLet\'s imagine that I am a new reader or someone who never reads fantasy or someone who hasn\'tread and loved the other books mentioned down 👇🏻 I would have absolutely adored this book and considered it one of the best Adult fantasy this year because I knew nothing of them.And surprise surprise! This is what is happeningbut ignorance is not an excuse!Just because you haven\'t read it does not mean it is OK for this book to copy everything!starting this book, I liked that the characters were older than 18. As much as I enjoy YA, sometimes the age just throws me off! However, they still acted like a bunch of 16 and 17 yr.the lingo itself was so cringeimage:I read many YA characters more mature than the main characters in this bookread Ageless and Warda\'s one 1 star review of this book to understand where these characters went wrongThis book attempted to give us a badass female lead that understands that she is flawed, and recognizes her physical incompetence, but does not give a shit. She knows her worth and trusts her intelligence to be her biggest asset so she uses it to get what she wants. She is unapologetic. She knows that if she can’t be cunning, it\'s her life on the line. “I’ll never get over how quickly people move on around here, how callously death is swept under a rug and trampled on minutes later”but, personally, this failed. Because Violet was the typical ""I am weak in the body but somehow I can wip all your asses and accomplish anything"". She is supposed to have a sort of chronic pain that renders her in the disabled category. This is not said out loud in the book. You have to guess it yourself if you are not familiar with the symptoms or learn it from social media. So, it was a role-eye for me seeing her winning every challenge by cheating (which I accepted at first because she was disadvantaged) but then we get no information on how she trained and made herself stronger!. so what was the point of giving her a disability if we cannot see how she overcame it? Also, It was annoying at times seeing Violet practically throwing herself at Xaden like “Pick me, choose me, love me, fuck me”. Girl! Have some dignity. But who can blame her, X is hot and has""Shadow hands, iykyk.... looking at you ACOTAR and ToG fans""and let’s not forget the dragons! I mean who doesn’t love dragons? Throw in dragons with personalities who can hold a conversation and you get yourself a winnerBut these bastards decided with their ever Holly wisdom that a person with a mental disorder (look up Aboulomania) or with a bit of a bitchy attitude is weak and should be scorched to deathI am not going to touch on the characters more than that. Others have explained in detailed reviews the problems with the main leads.And the world building? Excuse me! What world building! If you can answer one question that\'s been nagging me (from the book, not theories) then I\'ll shut up about itA dragon without its rider is a tragedy.\xa0A rider without their dragon is dead.Why? Why is it this way?However, there is abig issuethat is nagging at me and making feel like I am sitting on the most comfortable sofa in the world but someone has put a cushion full of needles at my back. Every time I get a little bit relaxed, a needle pricks my spine or neck or back arm.THIS BOOK HAS NOTHING ORIGINAL AND I DARE ANYONE TO PROVE OTHERWISEWhat this book did is take several old famous ideas from other books and movies, weave it together, and the author simply tailored them with spray edges and a catching cover for bait to come up with a supposedly new book that would please young readers mostly. to quote my friend: ""This book scratches an itchand boy! did this strategy work!This did not sit well with me because :One: the author did not just take from one or two books, she took from several.Two: these ideas were not just inspiration or sampling, in many parts were almost literalThree: copying and sampling are OK as long as the book brings it\'s own added plot or storyline which in this case, Fourth Wing did notWhen I was annotating this book, I marked each time I found an almost literal resemblance to other books. (yellow marks the number)So lets begin (and I am keeping the best or worst to last)Let me begin with the main characters descriptionNo, this is not Violet Sorringale. This is Mare Barrow from Red Queen series. Brown and silver hair and lightning powerAnd the whole ""assumed dead brother who is resurrected and turns out he joined the rebellion""YeahIt\'s like FW has this weird fixation on this seriesbut Violet braids her hair you say! you know who else has silver braided hair and dragons?and how about this one?no this is not Xaden Riorsonthis is either the tall dark and all powerful Rhysand and his Shadow power (and Rhys sacrificed himself for his people, Xaden did as well)or the tall dark and handsome Dorian and his shadow handsBut Xaden has a scar on his face, near his eye more precisely! You know who else tall dark and handsome with an eye scar and rhymes with Xaden!Meadows baby! Our last name is MeadowsNo!? OK, here\'s another tall dark and handsome with scars and is always surrounded by showdows and his name starts with Az and ends with ""are you for real?!""Now, here\'s a trivia for youLet\'s count the number of books where if the guy has Shadow powers the girl gets a control over lighteningJust off the top of my headRed QueenShadow and BonesThe Shadow of Lightening .. etc.Now the plotline1-\tHarry Potter: not talking about magic systems and dragons because many books have those, but “the cadets are thrown into “four wings” upon their arrival, they have to study and compete by gaining “points” and showing skills both physically and mentally.. The literal taking was from p 313 when there is a“tournament”where they had to“retrieve a stolen treasure”to“earn 60 points”2-\tDivergent: I knew that this book was marketed as a combination of Divergent meets Game of Thrones I think, but it took the inspiration too far. I don’t want to read a cheap imitation of Divergent which this book had. The cadets are distributed into quadrants (factions). Violet ends up in the Riders (Dauntless) quadrant where if you show any sign of weakness you are either killed by a fellow cadet or scorched by a dragon!And the Tris/Four moment between Violet and Xaden is also hard to miss. She has a parent/sibling issue, he has a daddy issue. She fantasizes about him all the time (which is nauseating and untasteful at times). Him beating her ass and showing her that he hates her and maybe wants to kill her then ending up saving her life and training her. Even the knife-throwing scene was taken. And it goes on and on3-\tThe Hunger Games: this whole book was the Hunger Games – Dragon Edition. The cadets are literally allowed to kill each other even under the watchful eyes of their superiors. But that is not surprising when the professors so simply snap a cadet’s neck infront of others. I guess “the odds are always stacked against them” yep! This was in the book!And since they are at war and need soldiers, what better way to show how desperate they are than killing off their cadets, instead of sending them off to the other houses 🙄🙄4-\tShatter me/ACOTAR: What are these two series famous for? You guessed it. The predictable love triangle where the first love interest turns out to be a douche and the heroine ends up falling for the dark morally grey character. This is really starting to sound repetitive and obvious.5-\tThrone of Glass (Empire of Storms): Dorian Havilliard has Phantom hands and Xaden has Shadow hands! Both can lift and hold anything with these “hands” and use them during intimate moments. In the beach scene, Aelin and Rowan’s passion fuses their power together and lose control. Same with Vi and X6-\tMulan: (yep! The animation) Mulan shows her strength and proves herself to her camp by using her wit to climb the pole using the weights instead of carrying them to retrieve the arrow and later they use their belts to climb the columns of the palace. The same move Violet uses by planting the rope around the shaft to climb it.7-\tHow to train your dragon: from the description of the dragons, to the lowering of the eyes when meeting one, to the Hiccup and Toothless moment, and the big scarry dragon and the small golden cute one, you cant help noticing these similarities when reading this bookBUT HERE ARE THE MOST OBVIOUS COPY CAT ISSUES8- The plot conflict of the book is the same as Game of ThronesSo instead of the seven kingdoms, Navarre is divided into six but with the province in the east makes it seven! To protect itself, Navarre has built a WARD (wall) around its borders to stop an enemy that we later learn about. This enemy is ruled by a Sage (night king) who creates these venin, monsters that are destroyed only by a special material (valerian steel) which the cadets are forging into blades!people inside the kingdom think that those creatures are just folklore. Venins have the ability to make dragon-like creatures, wyverns, that can breathe BLUE FIRE and dies immediately if their creator diesimage:And the h that has the baddest dragon has silver hair which is always in a braid🙄and thought at first to be fragile and weak!9- Dragon Riders of Pern and Eragon (edited,) I originally related it to Eragon but many friends pointed out that the whole concept of dragon riders bonding with the chosen dragon and that such a dragon can mentally communicate with its rider through witty conversations and big personality is from the mother of all Dragon stories - the Dragonriders of Pern by Anne McCafferyEven the scene where V and X feel horney bec of the Dragon lust is definitely not original to The Fourth Wing10- Dragon School: Just when you think that having Voilet be a Female main lead with a disability is something original of this book, you find out it is not! Dragon School is an acclaimed YA book series by K.L Wilson published in 2017 about sixteen-year-old Amel who joins the Dominion Dragon Riders. But Amel has not only a crippled leg but also chronic disease and Dragon School training is grueling. Before she can even become an initiate, she must complete her First Flight on a dragon. Everyone around Amel thinks she will die before her first ride because of her fragile state and disability. SOUNDS FAMILIAR?Bonus courtesy of @Soyas.ReadingpalaceThis is the map of the Fourth WingThis is the map of the Witcher booksnotice anything?so, there is nothing original about this bookYou want to take the characters\' descriptions? fineoh, you want to take also the plot conflict? finewhat? you want also all the famous plotlines?BUTWhat are you bringing to the table then?????Another side issue that bugged me which was the queer representation. What representation??? I didn’t see any! A representation is when you have a character or a couple of them who are queer. This book made it out as if everyone is Bi and that it is natural for everyone to jump into bed from man to woman. If this is everyone, then this is the norm of the society in the book and there is no representation.I think that this book would be enjoyed by a person who hasn’t read the above-mentioned books or doesn’t want to read them so you get to read a mash-up of them. If you are this person, then this book is perfect for youHowever, I am a reader who values authenticity not imitation done blatantly.

Yeah, that’s exactly how I feel after finishing Fourth Wing.Summary:There are only two ways to leave Basgiath War College: graduate or die. \u2060\u2060Violet was supposed to enter the Scribe Quadrant and live a quiet life among books. However, when her mother, the commanding general, forces her to join the Riders Quadrants to become a dragon rider, she must push herself past all limitations in order to survive. \u2060\u2060Staying alive would be a lot easier if Violet didn\'t have a target on her back for not only being \'small and frail\' but the daughter of the woman responsible for the deaths of many cadet\'s traitorous parents, including Xaden Riorson\'s - the most powerful and ruthless wingleader. She should stay away from him, but a fire burns between these two that is bound to consume them both. \u2060\u2060With stakes this high, every day could be her last. So Violet must learn to do the one thing she was never trained to do: fight. \u2060""I will not die today."" -Violet Sorrengail\u2060WHAT TO EXPECT:✨ adult romantasy✨ true enemies to lovers✨ war college setting✨ dragon riders✨ magic✨ underdog fmc / chronic illness rep✨ scarred anti-hero mmc✨ unique world building✨ complex politics✨ found family✨ high stakes✨ insta-lust with slow burn✨ 2/5 🌶️ (2 explicit spicy scenes)✨ cliffhanger endingMy Thoughts:I am utterly obsessed! Mark my words, this is the next big romantasy series!The writing is easy to digest, the world-building is fascinating, the heroine is an underdog and total badass, and the romance develops at a believable pace and is scorching! I laughed. I cried. And I fell in love. This book will forever live in my head rent-free! \u2060Violet Sorrengail is a secret badass!I LOVE her!!!!! She’s a twenty-year-old bookworm who’s expected to live a life as a scribe but now must survive and become a dragon rider. Physically, she’s smaller and frailer than the other cadets in the quadrant, but that doesn’t make her weak. Her mind is her strength and what she needs to survive. I love how Violet handles her situation with courage and grace and how she creates meaningful relationships at the risk of her own heart. She’s extremely relatable, and I can’t wait to see how she grows.Xaden Riorson...this man has easily become one of my top book boyfriends of all time!The son of a traitor, he’s out for revenge against Violet, whose mother led to his father\'s death. From a distance, he’s a scary, scarred, intense anti-hero, but deep down, he’s a man who is loyal, caring, and wise. And the way this man obsesses with Violet….damn. You truly don’t know if he wants to kill or f*ck her, probably both, but yeah, it’s hot! The things I would let this man do to me. 🥵The enemies-to-lovers romance was perfect, with an intense slow burn and eventually spice!I appreciated the time it took for these two to finally get together. And when they finally do, it’s explosive! Thank goodness this is new adult fantasy because the things Xaden says and did go straight to my core, lol.The dragons stole my heart.I don’t want to say too much because it would spoil some of the books, but they are terrifying and amazing!!! They have their own hierarchy and politics, which we don’t see much of since they’re very secretive, but it’s fascinating how they decide to bond with humans to create a symbiotic relationship that ultimately helps protect the land. Can\'t wait to learn more about them in the next book!The found family aspect was done so well!As a dragon rider, you\'re encouraged not to form strong attachments since most people in your school will either die before becoming riders or later on during battle. But Violet goes against this and finds her ride or dies - specifically Rhiannon and Liam! 💕The world building so easy to understand yet very interesting.I’ve never actually read a series focused on dragons and dragon riders, so this was new and exciting for me! It was so interesting learning about the different quadrants - scribe, rider, healer, and infantry - and the schooling required for each. Obviously, this story focuses more on the Riders Quadrant, which honestly is the most exciting because it\'s so intense, challenging, and cutthroat. I personally don’t know if I’d survive, but maybe if I had a friend like Violet, it would be possible!PS: For all you Manon and Abraxos fans out there, you’re going to fall in love with this world!!!For the most part, the story was a bit predictable, but it’s all done in a way that I was entertained and excited to keep reading!I mean, we\'ve seen similar stories where the seemingly weak heroine finds herself in a kill-or-be-killed situation and has to learn to fight and ultimately ends up thriving. So in that regard, you can guess where the story is heading.HOWEVER . . .That ENDING was everything I was not expecting!Those last 50 pages were absolutely epic and blew my fucking mind!!!!!! I DID NOT see that ending coming! I cried and then was left stunned by that last sentence. It\'s a cliffhanger, but it\'ll leave you more in shock instead of in pain, so don\'t be afraid of it! It\'s brutal and will make you want to immediately pick up the next book. Luckily we don\'t have to wait for long since the release date is November 7, 2023!But with everything I love, there are a few things I didn\'t like . . .Sometimes, the wording Violet used to concerning Xaden was a bit repetitive and immature.She kept describing him as beautiful and hot anytime he crossed her mind or showed up. I wish she would have used other words from time to time.The reader has to essentially piece together why Xaden falls for Violet.It’s quickly explained later in the story, but by then, it felt like we were being told more than shown. I would have liked for him to verbalize it more during the story. At least, more than him just saying things like “I can’t stay away from you”or “you’ll be the f*cking death of me”. Every time he\'s say those things, I was like, tell me why, though!Overall, Fourth Wing is an epic story that you will devour! I wouldn’t say this is a perfect 5-star read, maybe it’s closer to 4.5 since it wasn’t ‘perfect’, but honestly, I don\'t care. I haven’t read a fantasy I felt this way about in a long time, so I\'m giving it all the stars.Thank you, Entangled Publishing, for sending me an arc copy in exchange for a review.

I can\'t humanely comprehend how this has a higher rating than Six of Crows. I just can\'t. Here are the things I agree with that everyone has been saying:Good idea,fucking awful, god awful execution.And a little bit of a Shadow and Bone rip off if you ask me.She is supposed to be a scribe. She is forced to become a rider, she gets there, her childhood best friends who has always had feelings for her is mad that she is there, and worried that she won\'t survive. But don\'t worry, because theSHADOW WIELDERbad boy who hates her is there to train her and teach her all about that world. Oh and by the end she ends up being aLIGHTENING WIELDER. There hasn\'t been one in centuries.May the sun summoner bless you Fourth Wing, you\'re about to getroasted.Let\'s get the disability rep talk out of the way, many people told me there was some. And even if there is, the author approached the subject so so so subtlely I honestly couldn\'t even tell it was there. Because the only thing that was actually written was:I am so tiny, I am so weak, I am so fragile, frail, I will crumble. Please, don\'t send me to the dragon riding academy, because I am ramen noodle and I will break and die. Have I also mentioned I am white, pale, and very very very very thin? By the way, I am tiny. I am so smoll. I can\'t even jump on the dragon\'s back I am so small.How will she ever survive?I feel like for people who don’t know that specific disability, she doesn’t give you any insight? Like what does it mean? How does it happen? What is it called? As someone who had never heard of it before it was hard to even notice when she was talking about the disability. It didn’t bring any kind of awareness (which I’d think would be the whole point)Also someone who is this breakable can’t be having wild fucking sex but apparently we forgot about her disability during the sex scenes lmao.But it doesn’t matter because no matter what, everyone wanted to kill her and THERE WAS NO WAY SHE WOULD EVER SURVIVEIn this place where apparently people die daily, like flies. So much danger, so much death, so much struggle. That you don\'t see. You just hear about it because the author got too lazy to actually do any world building. So for the first half of the book there is just a bunch of telling and no showing.But don\'t worry, this frail, little pale, white girl, with white hair will bond not ONE BUT TWO of the rarest most powerful dragons alive. Even if she\'s not even tall enough to jump on their back.Also, enemies to lovers? Where? Where the fuck was that? These two have less chemistry than a priest with a hooker. Her mom is responsible for the death of someone in his family, so he blames her, he wants to kill her, he hates her from the momen the sees her (it lasts about two pages). But every time SHE SEES him, all she can think of is:""He\'s a shark and everyone next to him is a fish"", Dammit I don\'t want to find this asshole hot, but he\'s so hot"", "" ""omg, he calls me violence intead of violet, I am not attracted to toxic men but why do I want to bounce on his dick sooooooooooo bad...""So she basically sounds like a 14 year old valley girl for the entire book.They barely have any significant encounters, all of their interactions are so cringe that it makes me think this book should have been published in 2001. He smells like citrus, he has 107 scars on his back. And he tells her she\'s going to be the death of him every time he gets a chance.""He\'s a very dangerous addiction. Something women will kill for. ""If you catch me killing for men, please, end me first.Anyways, of course we have the most recycled sex dialogue on the plannet.OH GODS - WHICH GOD ARE YOU CALLING OUT FOR ITS JUST ME HERE AND I DONT SHAREThey fall deeply in love with each other, even though they barely interacted throughout the book, barely created a connection and didn\'t even hate each other at all for longer than a couple of pages. She bonds with the most powerful dragons alive, one of her dragons is mated to HIS DRAGON, and every time the dragons get horny SO DO THEY. So they have to learn how to control the hornyness coming from the dragons wanting to fuck.I wish I was joking.The book ends with avery predictable cliffhanger (which is a rip off from Red Queen and Divergent)and now this is one of the best selling books in the world.Watchu gonna do.I guess there is something out there for everyone. Part of me thinks that most people got paid really well to love this book so much. But that would be disingenuous of me to say, because I know people who didn\'t get paid who enjoyed it. So I guess I can see that this book might feel nostalgic.It gives you all the 2001 writing cringe fest, so if you missed reading something like Twilight, you\'ll definitely have fun. The characters are as childish as Zodiac Academy characters, so if you enjoy that, you might have a good time. She steals elements from Harry Potter, Shadow and Bone (most of the plot actually) ACOTAR, and used the writing style and sex scene lines most booktok people love, soBOOM! Best-Seller.Anyways, I am finally fucking free. I think I have learned my lesson and I willl chill on the booktok recommendations for a LONG LONG LONG TIME.She just ""borrowed"" SO FREAKING MUCH from many other popular series that this feels so unoriginal. It almost feels like she threw this book into an AI and said: write me a YA novel and the AI grabbed all the most popular series and put it in there. The sex scenes are all repetitive and recycled. It reads like YA, but it has none of the good aspects from YA, there’s too much sexual content that adds nothing to the plot (and this is supposed to be a fantasy series) So yeah, it\'s a no from me. Too bad as well because the dragons were cool.UPDATE:I was literally going through my old Throne of Glass highlights and found ANOTHER series this author ripped off. Aelin says she wakes up everyday and tells herself she will not be afraid. Guess who does that too in this series? 🤣'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""”there is no me without you.”I. NEED. THE. NEXT.

AM. OBSESSED. WITH. THIS. BOOK.fourth wing had a great mixture between romance and high stakes, this story was giving me major divergent and the hunger games vibes like when i tell you the vibes where there, THEY WERE THERE. it had everything i loved (and dragons) - i haven’t felt this excited about a fantasy book in MONTHS but this was captivating and now i feel a reading slump coming bc of it lmao rip to me. this is a book that is really easy to get into, it’s very fast paced and was engaging right from the beginning to the very end, I WAS HOOKED!! this lives up to the massive hype it’s getting, i get it now.. i could have read this in a day, but i needed to slow it down and savour this book.➳ i found the fantasy and world building easy to understand (there are no dumb info dumps) - so this book is perfect for those who are new to reading fantasy; yarros takes what most other books only manage to allude to and truly brings depth to her story which brings it to life. i got hooked with the whole fantasy war school, quadrants and politics setting. this is a book i want to live in, i want to jump into the pages and never leave!!➳ i understand now when people say it was very predictable bc i guessed that ending from page 1 - however, i would much rather have a predictable book than one that makes no sense bc it is trying to confuse the reader w so much unnecessary shit added into it. this was done in a perfect way.”you look all frail and breakable, but you’re really a violent little thing, aren’t you?”↳violetis probably one of the most incredible FMCs i have read about in a while. i loved her tight bond w her sister, her dragons and the love she has for books. she’s tough, very strong willed, quick witted and not afraid to go the extra mile to succeed. she works through each challenge that is thrown at her by using her strengths and knowledge, and proves she belongs just like everyone else. i loved reading about her journey, seeing her exceed all expectations and break down every barrier she succumbed.— there is an disability representation with the fmc (she has a chronic illness) and the author done an amazing job at showing how her chronic illness doesn’t define her. i love how she shows everyone she is not some frail weakling that constantly needs to be protected.*cough* dain *cough*↳xadenis first introduced as the most powerful wing leader violet is warned to STAY AWAY from. violet had this superstition that he is out to kill her bc her mother had his father executed. but from the get go, we all know as an audience he doesn’t want to kill her, he was so smitten for violet right from the start. that man had weapons custom made for violet that would fit her body type, built a harness for andarna that clips onto tairn just so she could ride along with them and also literally made a saddle for violet to use on tairn so she doesn’t fall off while riding!! i can’t explain how much i love this man and his grumpy exterior but deep down he’s a big softy for those he loves. I JUST LOVE MEN WHO SHOW THEIR LOVE THROUGH ACTIONS!!— i will take no slander on him EVER. he is that typical broody, morally grey love interest ppl roll their eyes over, but he has DEPTH. this man fr had me kicking my feet in the air, giggling and screaming into my pillow whenever he would call violet “violence” 🤭 he is exactly what vi needed!! i just love how he always believed in her and only wants to see her at her full potential and succeed.the romance:oh my goddd, the romance was perfect!! 😮\u200d💨🤌🏼the slow burn?was burning, absolutely delicious.enemies to lovers?SPLENDID, BEAUTIFUL, EXECUTED PERFECTLY. i was itching for xaden and vi sm.the spice?DELECTABLE. TOE CURLING. the enemies aspect of this book was so satisfying, istg it had me going feral !! the tension was EVERYTHING. it's the perfect build up and the pay off is amazing once it happens.↳dainis anotheradam kentloser side hoe. he acts like vi is some fragile little girl that needs constant protection, tells her to leave bc he wanted her to be a scribe like she was intended to be not a dragon rider and hides her away. he was constantly holding her back and questions her ability at every turn,, PLS HE IS ADAM KENT CODED. and the sort of love triangle was very juliette, adam and warner literally cut the mf cameras. his death arc when?? next book im praying.↳tairn and andarna- they were the best addition to this book!! yarros done an incredible job with providing so much details about the dragons, their history and their personalities - i absolutely loved the interactions between the dragons and their riders - i fkn love tairn my grump, i adored his protectiveness over violet and would not even think twice about burning you alive if you hurt or touch her, yes xaden included lmaoo. he was so snarky it had me giggling w how sassy and unbothered he was. and i love how tairn and sgaeyl were a mated pair bc it ended up making violet and xaden tethered heh 🤭“there’s no where in existence youcould go that i wouldn’t find you, violence”— okay but i could enthuse ab every little detail of this book, but this is one of those stories that you NEED to read. you don't just read a book like this, you live in it and never want to return, specially bc in this world xaden exists and you get to ride dragons.this isn’t a perfect book there are some flaws, but this was perfect to me! like yes it is super predictable, yes it’s tropey, but am i obsessed? YES, YES I AM. it had everything i wanted in a fantasy book and so many dragons. this story will be something different to everyone, you’re either going to love or hate it, but you need to read this at least once in your life. but ahh i can’t wait to get my greedy little hands on iron flame, i needed that book in my hands yesterday.thank youamelie&hannahfor br w me!! 🩷✨""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '1.5/5New half-year resolution—I need to stop taking recommendations from Booktok.I’m not gonna to lie here, if this series hadn\'t been raved about everywhere I looked online, I probably wouldn\'t have read it. I’m trying to stop reading TikTok popular books, but the rating in this book made me picked it up. Fourth Wing was my first book by Rebecca Yarros, so I didn\'t know what exactly to expect, but at least now I know that it will be my first and last story by this author, because it turned out not to be for me.This review probably won\'t cover all the things I didn\'t like about it, as I started skipping pages after about sixty percent of the book. But without further ado, let\'s finally get to the point of my review—what exactly didn\'t work out for me in this story.The story didn’t hooked me up from the beginning at all. The main reason for this is probably because the writing style didn\'t speak out to me. I actually dnfed it the day before, because of that reason, but decided to give it another chance because I thought it might not be my day for it or maybe I wasn\'t in the right mood after a whole week. At one point I was even glad about this decision, but my enthusiasm didn’t last long. I have to be honest and say that around forty percent of the book I was pretty invested in the story when the dragons finally showed up. Unfortunately, it turned out I was only interested when the dragons were involved. The rest was just boring for me.The second thing is that I felt no connection to the characters. Literally nothing. I must admit that Violet had some great moments, but most of the time I was just embarrassed by her actions. The example.“Glad to see our year apart hasn’t dulled your tongue, Vi.”“Oh,” I toss over my shoulder as we walk into the hallway, “I can do quite a few things with my tongue. You’d be impressed.”That line sounded like a horny frat boy.Also, if you didn’t get it that she was short and tiny, the author kept reminding you of that, because that information was indeed very important.""I’m too short.""“So she’s small.” Mom scans me up and down""""Good gods, I don’t even reach his collarbone.""""I’m shorter than most.""“You’re pretty small for a rider, but it looks like you made it.”""I’m at a disadvantage, that I’m too small to climb its foreleg and mount,""“You’re tiny.” He says it like an insult""""I’m the smallest of our squad""“I’m too short for the ramp,” I whisper to Rhi.""“I’m too short to span the distance!” I hiss, uncaring that anyone could hear us.""\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200eThat\'s only from twenty-six percent of the book. I did not include the rest, because I would not have enough space for the rest of my review.Moving to Xaden—aka, your typical fantasy hero. Seriously. He was your usual tall, black haired, with strong sharp jaw, muscled body, but this time he was riding dragons. I almost forgot, he was""Flaming hot. Scorching hot. Gets-you-into-trouble-and-you-like-it level of hot.""you get the picture. He was also tall. I\'ve written about it before, but we\'ve also been reminded of it a lot. I had to mention that sentence he said here, because I was laughing my ass off at that moment.""You have incredibly touchable skin.”Touchable skin? What does it mean buddy?Honestly, the dragons were more interesting than the main characters here. If the book was about Tairn, I\'d probably be more eager to read it. This dragon had better personality than both of them. At least for me. Tairn was literally my favorite character here. That says a lot about how much I enjoyed this book.The last thing is the romance between Xaden and Violet. This series is supposed to have five books and they already done the deed, are in love—probably because I didn\'t make it to this part, and have a strong connection—again, probably because I didn\'t make it to this part. I thought that at least their first meeting, which is usually quite important, will be more spectacular. But, no. They met in the fourth percent of the book and I was like""Well, that’s it? Already?"". They were supposed to be enemies to lovers, the reasoning behind it made even sense, but they deliverednothing.I felt no chemistry between them, no tension, especially the sexual one, and no hatred that they should feel towards each other as enemies. Almost every time Violet saw Xaden it went like that.""I hate him so much""\u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e""But he is so sexy and beautiful and sexy. And tall.""Not even their first kiss and the cute nickname the hero usually gives the heroine saved them. The first kiss happened after Violet found out that they could feel when their dragons banged.Yes, they could feel their dragons banging.This information made me feel quite uncomfortable. Extremely even. I know they could get rid of that with some magic or whatever, but just why? The nickname ""Violence"" that Xaden called Violet was tacky and the book could easily have survived without it. Not to mention this line.""you’re really a violent little thing, aren’t you?”My only thought wasFrom Blood and Ash. It sounds damn similar. Even though I only read the first book from this series.Moving forward to the things I liked.The dragons.Ending my review, all I will say is that I am pretty sad and disappointed that I didn’t end up liking this book. I wanted to start a new fantasy series that I would be obsessed with, but I guess we can\'t have everything we want. I’m happy for people who loved it though. Good for you guys.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'If I had a million dollars for every cliche in this book, of which there are a multitude, I\'d still regret spending $20 on all 498 pages of this mess.Spoilers to follow :)Let\'s start with the worldbuilding!Now, this book had two things I love dearly: dragons, and an academic setting. Yarros, however, explains almost every element of her world so poorly and sporadically that the entire story feels as though it were concocted page by page. The hierarchy of squadrons and sections and wings is so unnecessarily confusing. The whole ""war"" going on along the border is so vague, it was obvious from the start that some twist was going to reveal the good guys were actually the bad guys all along. The author\'s primary method of exposition is dropping pieces of information into conversations that feel forced and completely unnatural. No one talks like that. No one shares information like that.Now, the writing!The sentence constructions alone were enough to give me a headache. I can\'t tell you how many times I had to reread entire paragraphs because of poorly written and run-on sentences. As for the dialogue, let\'s discuss the fact that everyone talks like it\'s 2023, despite the medieval setting. I\'m not kidding, the female character asks herself at least twice, using these exact words, ""Is it toxic that I like this guy even though he can kill me?"" Yes. Yes it is. And so is all this internal monologuing. Please, end my suffering. Apart from the sentences and dialogue, the descriptions were severely lacking. Every location felt like a vague impression rather than an actual place. I don\'t think I\'ve ever encountered a book suffering from white room syndrome quite like this one.Now for the characters. Oh, the characters.Starting with the main event, we have frail young Violet who is SO relatable because she\'s SO clumsy and SO bad at things! Simultaneously, she is SO smart (like smarter than everyone) and SO unique that she gets not one, but TWO dragons to bond with her! And of course, they\'re both the rarest kind of dragons that exist!!! And naturally, everyone wants her dead for... reasons. But does her life being in danger give her any sense of self control? Absolutely not! She argues with everyone and throws her sass around to both peers and superior officers with little to no consequence. This woman has the survival skills of a fruit fly!! Additionally, her moods go back and forth quicker than an Olympic ping-pong match. First she hates Xaden because he\'s a traitor. Then she loves Xaden because she decides to trust him. Then she hates Xaden because he\'s a traitor. I\'m expecting the cycle will continue in Book 2. Also, she starts off wanting to be a scribe and gets pissed when she\'s thrown into the Rider\'s Quadrant, then she decides she desperately wants to be a Rider because... because? The decision is given hardly any explanation or emotional weight.And then there\'s discount Rhsysand. Oh wow, the moody black-haired rebel with tattoos is actually the good guy. Shocking. He\'s hard on the outside, but a softie on the inside. Groundbreaking. Also, the way that Yarros writes his character from Violet\'s perspective is downright sickening at times. From the very first scene with him, Violet\'s internal thoughts about Xaden are grossly objectifying. Everything is about his body, and how hot he is, and how badly she wants to sleep with him. There\'s an entire scene spanning two pages where Violet and another woman are straight-up ogling shirtless Xaden while he\'s sparring with another guy. It\'s disgusting. If the roles were reversed, if a male author wrote about a male character viewing a woman in the same way, heads would be rolling. It\'s gross, and frankly one of the most disappointing things about this book.Honestly, none of the other characters were interesting enough to write about. The dragons were fine, and probably the most likeable. Sawyer was the only human I found tolerable. Dain was just annoying, as he was clearly meant to be.Now, the plot.The majority of this book was consumed by Violet being horny and a random series of challenges. There was no explanation anywhere of what the academic year would look like, which makes me think the author was just making up more challenges and battles and war games as she went along. All of this, of course, leading up to a real challenge where we find out information that was abundantly obvious from the start. Oh no, the good guys are the bad guys. The bad guys are the good guys. The dead brother is actually alive. I wish I cared about any of this, but I don\'t because it\'s been so blatantly obvious since the first chapter. The pacing of this book was tedious in a lot of places because there wasn\'t really any kind of looming threat beyond the vague allusions to bigger attacks along the border. Nothing in this book surprised me. Nothing came even remotely close. Everything was so over-ridden with cliches and ideas from other books (mainly Divergent, and a little bit of Red Queen with the not-dead-brother ending) that nothing felt original or creative at all.I have searched earnestly, to the farthest hills on the horizon, for something good in this book. Alas, I return to my homeland empty-handed.And here\'s the thing: I so desperately wanted to enjoy this book, which makes it all the more disappointing. If you\'ve made it this far, I want you to know I did not approach this book with the intention of feeling this way. If you enjoyed this book, kudos to you. Feel free to keep on enjoying it. These are just my thoughts and opinions, and I\'ll content myself to be the cranky grandma of Goodreads if need be.

Picked up on a lot of foreshadowing. Rebecca Yarros is a truly talented writer, the emotions I felt reading it were so genuine, I was fully immersed. The characters and the story are fire.I loved Xaden and Violet even more, hated Dain with passion, Tairn and Adarana continue to be badasses and Liam...I got no words, I love that guy.~•~•~ORIGINAL REVIEW 👇(May 2023)THIS BOOK🤌🤌 Y\'all believe me it\'s worth the money. I am in loveeeeee, easily the best book I read this year and one of the best romantasy I\'ve read in a while. Books like this are the reason I fell in love with reading.Let\'s just jump right in, cause am excited to write this review.Read if you like-✔️ Zodiac Academy✔️ Divergent✔️ Throne of Glass✔️ Dragons🐉✔️ Academia setting (war college)✔️ High fantasy✔️ Chronic illness rep✔️ Enemies to lovers✔️ Slow burn✔️ Spice (3.5/5) 🌶️""... There\'s nowhere in existence you could go that I wouldn\'t find you, Violence.""Trained to be in the Scribe Quadrant, theFMC- Violet,found herself in the Riders Quadrant- the most elite of Navarre, where survival is of the fittest and the strongest. All she needs to do is not get killed and bond with a dragon, but it\'s not as easy. Not only she has to escape the clutches of the students who want her dead, with few dragons willing to bond; she also has to keep away fromXaden, MMCwho wants her dead.From page 1 till page 633 I was hooked. Theworld buildingis detailed and well thought out. Theplotis consistent and true to itself. Thepacing,fluctuates a bit in the second half but mostly stays fast paced for the majority of the book.""Tell me what you\'re thinking?""""I was thinking you are exactly as I predicted the first time you took me in my room.""""Oh yeah? And what was that?""""A very dangerous addiction.""Coming to thecharacters-⚡Violet-I loved her. She\'s brave, compassionate, goes to lengths to protect others and knows how to stand up for herself and others. Having had chronic illness, people always underestimate her(all but one)but that\'s what makes her an underdog. I liked how balanced her character and personality was, never over the top. Loved following her journey through the war school and boy how she developed and grew in those pages.🖤Xaden-Idk if anyone else is saying this but I will- Xaden has the same vibe that Warwick from Savage Lands does, but Xaden does it better. There\'s just something about their personality that\'s so similar. Give the Savage Lands series a go if you liked Xaden. Anyway, I loved him so much. He\'s a badass. Once her started opening up, and we got to see the softer side of him- I was swooning. He\'s powerful, sexy, and knows when to pick his battles, certainly not a push over.Dain-What an ass. Radiates the same energy as Tamlin in ACOMAF.The othersupporting charactersare good as well, they grow on ya- especially the dragons and Liam. Tairn and Adarana have my heart. I loved them since the first time they spoke. They have a sense of humour, are badass and protect so fiercely. Saegyl was okay-ish, not much of her tbh.Now I want a dragon 😭""I\'m going to keep you. You\'re mine, Violet.""""Only if you\'re mine.""""I\'ve been yours for longer than you could ever imagine."" ❤️\u200d🔥❤️\u200d🔥Theromance is an angsty slow burn, enemies to lovers with spiceand oh how brilliantly it was executed 🥰 I was all in my feels, swooning and melting and basically loved it. And if you like thecharacters being jealous,you\'ll enjoy that trope here too. I do think there was a pinch of ""who did this to you"" but wasn\'t that impactful. Xaden and Violet\'schemistryis off the charts. They compliment each other so well and I like how open and honest they are with each other, and that both of them don\'t hold each other back and give the other room to make mistakes, learn and grow. It is a mature relationship yeah. Also, thesmutwas hot.. no seriously, things did get hot and broken down 🤭Theendingwas an emotional rollercoaster. I was crying so much at one point, had to take deep breaths to resume reading. I cannot wait for the sequel 🤩It\'s such a masterpiece in my opinion. I haven\'t felt this in love and so strongly about a book in a while and am so genuinely happy I read this 😭😭❤️It\'s a binge worthy action packed romantasy with never a dull moment. You are missing out if you haven\'t read this. Idk what are you all doing, GO READ IT! I promise it won\'t disappoint.Y\'all think Amazon will have a dragon? 🤔~•~•~I have no words.

The Dragon Rider\'s Codex🐉Well, you guys all know how excited I have been for this book release since I haven\'t been exactly subtle about it, so the big question is, did it meet my unreasonably high expectations? The answer is NO......... because this book exceeded my expectations. WOW!!! What an absolute wild ride! Obsessed is the only word I have to describe how I feel about this book. Every page, every word had me on the edge of my seat, and this book elicits every emotion from you. The absolute unflinching brutality the characters face is both addictive and shocking, but there are also so many triumphs and heart squeezing moments. I am not exaggerating when I say this is my favorite fantasy read this year if not in many years! I can\'t wait for the next installment to come out bc that ENDING!!!""It seems.... cruel, but the first rule of living at Basgaith is never question a dragon.

She has trained her whole life to be scribe but when her mother, a General and the head commander at Basgiath orders her to sign up as a Dragon Rider cadet her odds of survival aren\'t looking too good. All the odds are stacked against her, from a condition that affects her bones and ligaments that leaves her in chronic pain to the brutal and unforgiving dragons that kill without mercy to her fellow cadets who are just as blood thirsty and willing to kill her to even the odds. Certain death seems to be around every corner. Violet is not going down without a fight though, and she will do everything she can to defy the odds to earn her spot and above all a DRAGON!""But I will not run. I wouldn\'t be standing here if I\'d quit every time something seemed impossible to overcome. I will not die today.""-Violet""I\'m used to functioning in pain asshole. Are you?"" -VioletViolet- I don\'t say this lightly, but Violet Sorrengail is among my all-time favorite fmc\'s ever. She is the embodiment of determination, grit and bravery. Her willingness to bet on herself time and again when so many around her keep telling her she will never be good enough is so inspiring. You can\'t help but root for her as the quintessential underdog bc she never lets herself be a victim despite her physical limitations. She feels like the blueprint for my favorite kind of fmc.""Killing you wouldn\'t be any trouble Violence.

Is it too early to start the countdown clock for the next book?!!Please check TW besties as this book deals with themes of Violence and War.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'I’m sorry, but it’s a no from me.It’s always a case of you questioning yourself when a hyped book doesn’t work for you.But I have reasons and regrets and I want a refund. Of my time and money.I can’t decide whether to rate this 2 or 1 ⭐️.It’s a 1 ⭐️ rating. 🤦🏾\u200d♀️I’m about to drop some truth bombs,so if this is the type of book for you in where you don’t want to hear any form of slander, then look away.I’m going to be honest about my reading experience, which wasn’t all that great.😓It seems that fantasy romances, whether they’re adult or YA, have been using the same formula these past few years in where the focus solely lies on the plot and the action scenes and the same attention isn’t given to the characters and their world. And I do not understand why that is the case. The balance between them all is off.The characters (all of them, not a single one was interesting) lacked substance, background and history. So by nature, I’m not even remotely interested in rooting for them and seeing them overcome the challenges they’re facing, because they are so poorly developed to begin with.The foundation of this world felt unbelievably flimsy and read messy to me. It was supposed to feel dangerous, the stakes were supposed to be high. Characters were being killed left, right and centre and the only thing I felt was nothing.There was no order to the way it was being built upon. Just chaos, convenience and stupidity all round.Violet’s character could’ve been made more interesting (to me) if:▪️We had we seen her time as a scribe before she was forced to become a rider.▪️See her actually train and get stronger.▪️See how she generally fought through her chronic pain.▪️See her deal with the grief of her brother.▪️Explore the weird dynamic she has with her mother.▪️See the friendships forming and the romance truly developing.▪️See her fuckin’ bonding with those dragons.All of these things would’ve added nuance and depth to her characterisation, to the actual story itself. Are we privy to any of that? No. Those aspects are mentioned and that’s supposed to be good enough whereas I would’ve liked layers.Characters shouldn’t read so one-dimensional.And enemies-to-lovers where? Please. 🙄 This trope was used in the most juvenile way.You could argue that the romance itself was juvenile.We could’ve honed in on the hate since both these characters suffered losses, come from different and opposing backgrounds, have some real animosity and tension built between them but the love interest was hardly ever present.Next thing you know, the trope was flung out the window instead of it being morphed into something real.So, I fail to understand why this was sold as a fantasy romance.I can’t tell you why these two liked each other, let alone love. There was no development ofgenuine, romantic feelings.There was a buildup of attraction and supposed sexual tension. But that’s it.Another thing that bugged me is that we only got Violet’s perspective. I mean, this occasionally works, but ideally,no fantasy book should have a singular POV.I can’t begin to tell you how boring that narrative is.It gives such a limiting and subjective view of the world and the characters, and this especially gets more limiting when there are other characters present that also play a significant role in the story.Yet they weren’t utilised.Is it that hard to give different perspectives?The dragons were theONLYinteresting parts about this whole book.But they didn’t even get as much page time as they should’ve. They deserved more page time. I mean, if you’re going to have them talking, give them a POV as least. They could’ve told us about their own history.There were also some language choices that were made that felt odd in a fantasy setting.“Personally, I’m not arguing with their logic, just enjoying the view…respectfully, of course…”“So. Freaking. Beautiful.”“Holy. Fuckin. Hot.”No one talks like that in a fantasy world. 😒You know damn well some of this lingo doesn’t belong here. It’s so embarrassing and a testament to bad writing and bad editing.To top it all off, I still don’t know whether this was adult, new adult or YA fantasy. I couldn’t tell you. Goodreads has them all listed. Clearly, everyone is confused.In conclusion, all of this to say that this brand of poorly written, poorly developed fantasy story is just not for me. This book was not for me. I had a really difficult time immersing myself into the story.The ending was somewhat interesting, but by that point I was skim-reading. And I don’t care about this book enough to continue on with the series. I want to forget I ever read it.I’m avoiding all hyped books for the foreseeable future. 😪💔'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '0/5⭐️😍 OMG THIS IS THE (second) WORST BOOK IVE EVER READ IN MY ENTIRE EXISTENCE!!!🥰I’ve posted my iron flame review!! You can go read it if you liked this one :)Violet Sorrengail. Get it? SOARING-GALE BECAUSE DRAGONS SOAR ON GALES 🧍🏻\u200d♀️ THATS SO CLEVER.She’s like so badass because she’s like so dainty and like so small and has insert name chronic illness which makes her so badass and a really good candidate for a WAR SCHOOL. She is totally not a self-insert of the author because unlike the author she doesn’t have blonde hair, she has ultra special brown hair that turns a really rare silver as she gets older. (Because hair pigment works like that🤭)She’s also so super really fast because she’s SOO petite and small and little and fragile.And also the love interest is SOO much bigger than her and he’s the most powerful darkness-wielding highlord—oh sorry I mean dragon rider at the academy.because Violet being the daughter of the literal leader of the school wasn’t enough, she also gets a super mega rare giant black dragon AND a never-before-seen golden useless ass feathertailed baby dragon that has the ability to manipulate time. And don’t worry, Violet can summon lightning just in case you were concerned that Mare Barrow was the most obnoxious lightning wielder.Rebecca Yarrows is such a good writer 😍 all of her world building and info dumps are so unbearable to read!! Plus her writing is entirely YA and juvenile except for the horrific car crash level sex scenes that happen 80% into the book. What a slay!!All of her characters make me want to rip my eyeballs out🥰 but especially Xaden because he’s so tortured and scary and so much bigger than our poor baby fragile pathetic paper-boned protagonist Violet soaring-gale.The enemies to lovers is also so well done!! They were literally never even enemies😍 and I didn’t once believe they felt anything other than the most surface level lust for the other🤭Also why the fuck did Yarrows decide that when the dragons fuck that their riders also get really horny? That was information I did not ever need.The world building was so amazingly perfect!! I loved how she info dumped entire paragraphs of exposition and random facts onto us, but still never managed to outline how the actual school worked or why the fuck the gryphons couldn’t just be incinerated by the giant ass dragons with literal magic!!!!😍Oh, I also really enjoyed how the single black character with any personality was not only bisexual but hyper sexual and slept around with everyone!!! It was really great how Rhiannon was sidelined the entire novel so that Violet could also be useless!I also love how we don’t get to know anything about any of the side characters because Violet is too concerned with fucking Xaden!! 🥵The nickname of “Violence” for Violet, the character that literally did not kill a single person until the 75% mark also made a lot of sense!! I’m so glad she was at a war school and wasn’t required to kill a single person or even ever actually train without cheating her way through by poisoning her opponents!! She will totally not die in actual combat when she can’t sneak random ass made-up poisons into her opponents’ meals!! 😝I think it’s also so inspiring how Violet’s tiny 90 pound frame literally could not support swinging an 11 pound sword, but the dragons did not murder her for being weak (her words not mine) because she was so strong mentally because she complained about being in pain (despite claiming to be used to pain?) and so delicate and fragile all the time!! 🤩Also let’s just not talk about how Violet totally plays into the “toxic perseverance” trope by actively ignoring the symptoms and effects her disability has on her body and powers through everything because she’s “used to pain”!! That’s so good and such a good example to set <3It could have been interesting if Violet actually found ways to accommodate for her weaknesses/disadvantages that made sense, but clearly Yarros doesn’t actually give a fuck so she didn’t bother. The only example we have of this is a saddle which I’m sorry is stupid as fuck because why was everyone not already using saddles?? Did Miss Rebecca ever look into how fucking uncomfortable it can be not use a saddle or padding while riding horses much less consider how painful it might be to ride a giant, roughly scaled DRAGON that is FLYING THROUGH THE SKY?? 🙈This book was so incredible😍 I can’t believe booktok didn’t force this down everyone’s throats sooner!! It was so great to read this horrendous amalgamation of shitty world building, horrifically atrocious writing, and one dimensional characters with a nonsensical plot and a underdeveloped romance!!Legitimately the worst book I’ve ever read.

I had so much uni work to do, but I still flew through it. The author wasted no time – she made a fast-paced, action-packed, well established fantasy world. I love how we got introduced to bits and aspects of this world slowly, she really KNEW how to world build, how to ease us into this complicated setting. AT EVERY POINT OF THIS BOOK I knew what was going on, who I was rooting for, what are the aims of the particular scene. And you, my fellow fantasy readers, know how that doesn’t always happen. Like I said in the updates, EVERY SINGLE PAGE WAS A PLOT POINT and no fill-ins. I hate it when writers drag the story, you can really tell when they do that, and fantasy authors are for some reason prone to doing that. This wasn’t such a book. It’s not that long (around 400 pages) and I wasn’t bored in any scene. I love how the story intensified towards the end, but the stakes were high throughout the WHOLE THING.THAT Xaden CHAPTER ATEATEATEATE, I LOVED IT SO MUCH!AND THAT PLOT TWIST IT ENDED ON, I COULD NEVER EVEN IMAGINE THAT HAPPENING! UGH, I can’t wait for the next book.THE BADI said it before, WILL SAY IT AGAIN, this is the most formulaic book I’ve read in my life. You know when popular musicians make songs SPECIFICALLY so they can become popular on TikTok and you SOMEHOW ALWAYS KNOW. Yes, this was that, but for books. You can really tell the author used EVERY SINGLE TROPE she knows people love and will eat up and put it in her book (enemies to lovers, mated pairs, the whole rebellion trope, I’m the chosen one but I don’t want to be that blablabla), I just couldn’t get past that fact. Before reading this book I saw a few posts saying how this book is similar to ACOTAR. When I just started it, I didn’t really see the resemblance, but THEN I GOT IT. Dain is SOOOO Tamlin coded, Xaden is basically Rhysand, again the rebellion thing, THE MATES THING (god I hate that so much). I wouldn’t call this a carbon copy of ACOTAR, but you can’t tell me it wasn’t loosely inspired by it (for the sole purpose of satisfying booktok).This was in no way original, and that’s the number one thing I didn’t like about this book. There wasn’t a single thing happening, a plot point, a scene, a character trait, that I haven’t seen before. This plays into this being EXTREMELY FORMULAIC.For those who read it, is it just me? (I know it isn’t)THE DRAGONS WERE SO FUNNY. I’m sorry, I didn’t like the dragons. I liked them individually (as almost characters) BUT they WERE IN NO WAY WELL WRITTEN. They’re supposed to be these mysterious, dangerous, sacred creatures, but Violet’s dragon says the word FUCK at one point. I LAUGHED SO MUCH, HAD ME ON THE FLOOR.THE CHARACTERSUgh, they’re supposed to be adults, but they’re SO YA CODED. You can’t tell me Violet is 20.Surprisingly, I liked the protagonists, but individually. They’re both flawed, but also with a sense of moral, a great combination of characteristics. However, them as a couple, not really. The banter was there in the beginning but then it just evaporated. They went from being enemies to LOVERS THE PLANET HASN’T SEEN so quickly. They were enemies for a good chunk of pages, I must admit that, but the change was in no way gradual (pls go to the Mariana Zapata slow burn school k thanks).(And also, Violet was so desperate with the L word, GIRLIE STAND UP!!!)The spice was good ngl (had me kicking my feet lol)I LOVED THE SIDE CHARACTERS. RHIANNON AND LIAM (sorrows sorrows prayers) HAVE MY HEART.FINAL THOUGHTSThis was a fast-paced, highly enjoyable first book in the series I will for sure continue reading when the next installment is out. It wasn’t very memorable and won’t make the FAVORITES list, but I still had fun reading. I’m leaving room for improvement.Is it overhyped, tell me in the comments??? (let’s have a respectful discussion)💕💕'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'if y’all see me on the news tomorrow it’s because i broke into this author’s house and tried to steal the manuscript for the sequel…i can’t even begin to describe the attachment and love i have for this book and its characters. it’s one of my favorite books of all time now. the author really wrote the most heart wrenching, emotionally loaded, appetite terminating sentences and said “deal with it.”to put into few words: this new adult fantasy romance book is set at a war college, there’s dragons, and there’s 2 main opposing sides that hate one another. our fmc belonging to one and our mmc belonging to the other. i think you can see where this is going…WRONG because you could have 30 guns pointing at my head and i still wouldn’t have predicted THAT last sentence. all my brain matter would cover the wall behind me.Violet aka Violence (iykyk) is my favorite character all around. she’s just like me for real. the way she thinks and talks. she’s really a girls girl. i usually prefer dual pov but not in this case. being in her head made me realize i’ve never had an original thought. she’s a fmc written by a woman to its core. she strong, resilient, a fucking genius, badass, witty af, compassionate, and so damn attractive…god idk if i wanna be her or be with her… everything she goes through and overcomes made me shed a tear or 7. she’s unpredictable and that’s what i love about her.Xaden…i’ve never read a man described so damn sexy. i was in heat and prepared to do a line off this man’s stomach…his middle name is basically “self control” and the way that crumbles from just the mere existence of Violet. he says it best when “i’m annoyingly aware of everything you do…”i appreciated how he has a personality outside of the slow (and i mean slow) burn romance. he’s protective but not overbearing. he’s idealistic and charming without even trying. he “hates” her but literally had daggers made for her specific body shape and fit. he had a saddle made for her body type so she doesn’t fall off her dragon. he’s so thoughtful and attentive, it comes natural to him like breathing. the longing that’s in his eyes when he simply glances at violet (you’d think he’d be plotting her death from an outsider looking in) was written like poetry. Violet has him so tightly wrapped around her finger and they can’t even begin to understand the depths of it…one would think the romance would be my hyper fixation for this book but it’s not even that (not only that.) it’s the fucking dragons! the way they are described, have personalities of their own, the way they always check and roast Violet had me LOLing and giddy. the bonds they have with their riders felt as real as oxygen in the air! 😮\u200d💨some quotes that aren’t spoilery but still had me barking like a dog in heat:👹“heat rushes through every vein, wakes every nerve ending. I hate the reaction of my body to the site of him, but I can’t deny it. His appeal is so fucking inconvenient.” she is so me coded“i know how to handle a corset” and he does“There’s a palpable energy in every room, he enters, and brushes over my skin, like a caress each time our eyes meet. Even now, I’m aware of every breath he takes, as he sits next to me midway down the table.”“fuck, that stubborn, feisty look always makes me want to kiss you.” god he’s so miserable 😩the MCs and dragons dynamic is so uniquely and well written like nothing else i’ve read. it’s so ying and yang coded. this book, in short, is a limb to me. cut it off, i bleed out and die! it is diverse, rich, deep, magnificently written, and every fiber of me loves it (i say all of this referring to a piece of media that ruined my life🥲)'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""This is kinda harsh but my honest opinion after reading the ARC ~** May 2023 edit: I'm a bookseller and read a variety of genres including children's and YA. My issues are not with these genres. My issues are with books that read as clumsy, horny (and not in a fun camp way), and unpolished. Which in my Personal Opinion(tm)!!!!!!!!!! this book is.It's pretty stock standard commercial horny hetero fiction. That's fine. Can't please everyone. I'll be totally honest: if you don't care that much about quality of writing and want an easy het romance-fantasy novel à la Cassandra Clare et al. (nothing wrong with that!), you may enjoy this. It's not my thing, though, and I can't recommend it if you want a decent wholemeal fantasy novel to sink your teeth into. **I found this disappointing and I’m frankly shocked it has such glowing early reviews.To be fair, my disappointment is partly caused by the misleading blurb and ARC marketing. The blurb implies a high stakes military fantasy set at a war college for dragon riders; this put me in mind of Temeraire, The Poppy War, or even elements of The Hunger Games. Romance is mentioned - “traitors will become allies… or lovers” - but it’s certainly not implied to be wholly a romance novel.I saw on the author’s instagram that this is being marketed as a “new adult fantasy” - if 'new adult' just means ‘lacking the sophistication of genre fiction but can’t be marketed as YA romance because of sex scenes’… then, sure, call it 'new adult'.All the characters - even supposed high-ranking military figures - speak like millennials from the year 2023. Why was the word ‘vibe’ used so many times? As in, ‘his vibe is weird’. But in other ways the setting recalls medieval Europe? Who edited this???I would not have picked this up if the marketing more accurately reflected the content. It’s 100% a romance novel in the vein of Cassandra Claire, Sarah J. Maas, the Divergent series; any genuine stakes are basically subplot to the central romance. The oh-so-important ~tension~ could be resolved by just… talking to one another? Most other world building elements are underdeveloped & confusing, full of plot holes, and everyone’s dialogue is set up to give the protagonist & ~dark~ love interest perfect Marvel-esque quips and one-liners. I get that this is a popular thing but to me it lacks sophistication and polish of contemporary fantasy :-)Also, my certified transgender opinion (tm) is that the inclusion of a random nonbinary side character was disingenuous and definitely tokenism, lol.The reason for two stars instead of one is because I found the representation of the protagonist's disability - and how it was navigated in such physically demanding settings - genuinely interesting.All in all, this, to me, read like a semi-edited fanfic. If that’s your thing, go buckwild. Otherwise, I can’t really recommend it. The blurb is pretty misleading, imo. Expect a YA romance novel.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '""Decide, Violet. Are you going to die a scribe? Or live as a rider?""Oh, this is good. I see now why y\'all love it so much.IfFourth Wingwere a drug, I\'d be an addict. It grabbed me so thoroughly from the very first moment and refused to let go. I was fully immersed, I didn\'t want to sleep, didn\'t want to eat. I just wanted to inhale it as fast as I could. And honestly, isn\'t this why we read, for this exact feeling?The action begins right on the first page and never lets up. There was no onerous worldbuilding, no endless backgrounds or introductions. We just seamlessly slip into the world of Navarre and Violet Sorrengail. Every time I get the itch to read fantasy, the one thing that holds me back is how much worldbuilding I would have to endure just to get to the good parts. But no such issues here. The good parts start right at the beginning.Is this the most original story? No. Is this the most well written? Also no. (Don\'t kill me for saying that, all you rabid fans.) In fact, the dialogue has me cringing at times, with its penchant for f-bombs as emphasis and its often basic but slightly pompous back-and-forth that only teenagers can pull off. I guess in that way, it is true to its characters since they\'re all not much older than teenagers.But slight criticisms aside, this story is executed to perfection. It takes several well-trodden tropes and not only cohesively blends them together, but also manages to squeeze every ounce of entertainment out of them along the way. And I\'m not above being entertained.This is my first real foray into the romantasy genre that\'s got everyone aflutter. And I can see the appeal. Fantasy is a bit of an adrenaline rush and so is romance, so blending the two together is really the perfect symbiosis. Of course you\'d want your hero to fight hard in a war between good and evil. And it totally makes sense that they would love hard too if they could die any day. And if the object of desire is one\'s enemy instead of one\'s friend? Even better.I\'m a little late to theFourth Wingparty, and there\'s good reason. I was certain this was a duology (don\'t ask me why I thought this), so I figured if I just held off a little bit, I could bam my way through both books without having to stop and deal with the inevitable anguish of waiting for the next book. Well, the joke\'s on me because this is actually a five-parter. So lots of waiting will be had by me.

This is the worst piece of literature I’ve read in a long while. I got to chapter 8. Couldn’t go any further.First off, the endless use of the F bomb is tacky and lazy if you ask me. So many great descriptive words and all this author can do is spout curse words. Curse words do not a personality make. Neither is being a horny 13 year old. Violet is supposed to be 20 years old, but it seems more like she is 12. I mean…“the scar that marks his eye brow only makes him hotter. Flaming hot. Scorching hot. Gets-you-in-trouble-and-you-like-it-level-hot…”Who talks like that? I’ll tell you. Tweens.I think I’m rooting for the other side of this conflict too. What kind of battle strategy is it to encourage the deaths of dozens of people as an entrance exam? Then to be okay with it when your cadets at killing each other. Let’s just kill off a huge percentage of our able bodied young men and woman every year. Yup. Sound strategy. The big bad school is so scary! It’s incredibly cliche, predictable, and trite in all the worst ways.Violets only personality trait is that she’s SuPeR FaSt aNd SmArT.

It’s not just that it’s grueling and maliciously brutal, or even that it’s designed to stretch the riders’ capacity for pain beyond endurance.

No matter how hard I try, I cannot get this book out of my head, all because of those last 25 pages . . . \u2060How dare Rebecca do this to us, knowing we have to wait god knows how long for book 3. 😭\u2060Did I enjoy it?Yes.\u2060Was it better than Fourth Wing?No.\u2060But will I continue the series?Abso-f*cking-lutely!\u2060This book is really hard for me to rate because while I enjoyed the story and the ending, there were a lot of technical (plot/character) issues that definitely hindered my overall enjoyment.*SPOILERS AHEAD*\u2060What I liked:\u2060The story is action-packed from start to finish, so you\'ll never want to put this book down.Iron Flame is divided into two parts. Part one takes place at Basgiath War College and part two focuses on the Revolution. There\'s 623 pages total, and I genuinely felt like I read two books because so much happens. I\'m glad I took detailed notes because I\'ve already forgotten a lot and I know I\'ll need to refer to them before starting book 3.The continued world-building is fascinating.Like I said, this story is non-stop and that includes uncovering new information about the history and politics of this world. We now have a solid idea on what\'s really happening on the continent, however, there\'s still so many unanswered questions about the past (before the unification), the venin, and the Empyrean. I love this phase of a long series because there\'s still so much we don\'t know or understand, and I can\'t wait to see everything unfold and come together in the next few books. \u2060These characters are some of my favorites and need to be protected at all costs.Violet is still a badass. Xaden is still daddy. Tairn is fucking hilarious. And Andarna is the sassiest bitch in the realm. I do wish she wasn\'t away for half the story though.Violet internally struggled a lot more in this book by bottling up her emotions, distancing herself from her friends, and taking on too much responsibility (like researching the wards).Violet is just as strong and determined as she was in Fourth Wing, but in Iron Flame, we see the toll everything takes on her. I\'m glad that by part two she starts to lean on her friends more, but I\'m worried how she\'s going to manage after the events at the end of book 2. There\'s only so much a person can take, and I fear Violet may break at some point in the future. I\'m looking forward to seeing how her character develops in the rest of the series.PS: Violet during the torture scenes and and final battle when she saves Sawyer was impressive as hell! I respect her so much and strive to be just as badass.Xaden is still top tier book boyfriend material.Look, he is not perfect. In fact, I\'m a little pissed at him for constantly putting the responsibility of sharing truths on Violet throughout this story when he could have easily been open and forthcoming. BUT I DON\'T CARE. That man is just so damn confident, intelligent, sexy and loyal to Violet, that the minute he\'s on the page, I lose my damn mind. And when he writes letters to Violet . . . I melted. He isn\'t even a romantic guy, but did one of the most romantic things in the world.There\'s also a lot of side characters (both old and new) that I enjoyed getting to know better:Rhi, Ridoc, Imogen, Bodhi, Mira, Brennan, Sawyer, Jesinia, Sloane, and Maren. There\'s also a bunch of characters I loathe and wanted to see die a slow and painful death. Some don\'t. Some do. *cough* Varrish *cough*. Fuck that guy. But I can\'t complain, because everyone likes a good villain and Iron Flame definitely had a few!PS: I don\'t hate Dain anymore.Obviously, what he did was absolutely horrible and I don\'t think I can ever truly forgive him for the role he played in Liam\'s death. BUT we have to remember, he didn\'t know what was going to happen and seems to be very repentant for it all. Do I trust him? Hell no. But do I think he\'s a bad guy? No. I still think he needs to redeem himself, so I\'ll be curious to see where his character goes from here.Those few chapters with imaginary Liam were everything.😭 Liam\'s death absolutely broke me and still haunts me to this day. So seeing him again, in the way that we did, gave me some closure. But this entire situation has me wondering (THEORY AHEAD), what if Violet\'s second signent is her talking to the dead?! We know a lot of history has been lost or written out of existence, so I\'m wondering if the only way Violet can find answers is through some power of communicating with the dead?RIP Mama Sorrengail.For all of Fourth Wing and most of Iron Flame, I hated her. And honestly, even after everything, I still don\'t like her very much. However, while I know she wasn\'t a great person or mom, I understand her choices. Again, I don\'t agree with them, but she really thought she was protecting her children. I wept when she died, not because I am sad she\'s dead, but for Brennan, Mira, and Violet. They now know that even if their mom was misguided, her intention was driven by the love of her children and now that she\'s gone, they\'ll mourn what was and what could have been. They each had such different responses and I felt them all.The ending . . .I mean, I\'ve already talked enough about it but DAMN, I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING. I predicted General Sorrengail would die but I thought maybe Violet would get taken by the Sage or something. So yeah, I am still completely shocked by that ending, maybe even a little pissed, and will be sending Rebecca Yarros my next therapy bill.What I didn\'t like:This is a small gripe, but why are they using the Julian Calendar in this fantasy world?I mean, Rebecca created a completely new world but couldn\'t come up with different names for the months of the year? Every time it mentioned December or July, it totally took me out of the story.\u2060The pacing was frantic and for what?So much happens, yet, at the same time, I didn\'t feel like a lot happened to push the overarching plot forward. The highlights are: Violet goes back to school, Violet tries to learn about wards, Violet gets tortured, Violet and half the college goes back to revolution headquarters, Xaden and Violet get the luminary, and then the final battle happens. We didn\'t need 600+ pages just to give us that. @listenwithbritt mentioned in an IG reel that the pacing felt like she was watching a TV series, and I totally agree. Every few chapters felt like a TV episode with some small task that needed to be accomplished or there was a hurdle to overcome; then it would get quickly resolved and they\'d move onto the next thing. There were a lot of small subplots that were unimportant and felt like filler scenes. So the constant bombardment of action, angst, or mystery was a bit overwhelming and it was hard to decipher at the time what scenes were really important for the overall story. For example, what real value did the survival class or the death hike scenes offer? In my opinion, not much but creating small moments of conflict to keep the story moving along. Maybe Rebecca wrote Iron Flame this way since the series is getting turned into a TV series by Amazon.The story was too dense.There were too many new names, history, and general knowledge to really keep track of what was important. And there were quite a few things that weren\'t fully explained or were overlooked. Pair that with the frantic pacing, and there wasn\'t enough time to fully digest all this new information before we were forced to move on to the next part of the story. I had to read slowly, re-read sections, and take notes to keep track of everything. Doing that for 16 hours was a bit overwhelming and exhausting.I HATED the other woman (OW) drama.It’s a tacky, cheap, and overdone romance conflict and totally unnecessary. There was also a big inconsistency surrounding it. First off, Bodhi mentions Cat early on by saying how Xaden has never cared so much about anyone, not even Cat, which alluded that at some point Xaden was involved with and potentially cared deeply for another woman. But later, Xaden says Cat could die for all he cares and he has never loved her. So why was Violet lead to believe he had feelings for another woman at some point? Solely to create drama between Xaden and Violet. And why didn’t Violet ask Xaden about Cat the minute she found out about her? If she did this, she wouldn’t have been blindsided by it all CHAPTERS LATER when they went to get the luminary from Cat’s family.Also, Xaden should have been transparent about Cat when it first came up so Violet didn\'t spend chapters feeling insecure. And the way Cat was a nasty bitch to Violet the entire book, but then randomly decides she\'s cool with her after Violet saves her life was so anticlimactic. This was probably the weakest sub-plot of the entire book. And if there\'s more OW or OM drama in the rest of the series, I will fucking riot. Xaden better not use Cat to drive Violet away in the next book.I was underwhelmed by the romance.Honestly, their relationship was stagnant because they didn\'t have enough time together in this book. With Xaden being away for most of the first part and then they end up doing their own things for the Revolution during the second part, there was little time for them to really grow deeper as a couple.I also expected more groveling by Xaden at the beginning, but instead he makes Violet responsible for his honesty by saying she has to be the one to ask questions and then he\'ll answer. But for the entire book, Violet doesn\'t ask him anything! So, she doesn\'t get any answers! Meanwhile, Xaden just sits around, not communicating with Violet, when he could easily take the initiative to share his truths. Their lack of communication was so frustrating and was definitely done to create drama for the story. It was dumb and lazy writing. They could have easily set aside time to really hash out the issues of their relationship and dive deep into the secrets Xaden is keeping, but they don\'t.The smut also didn\'t hit this time.For the size of this book and the fact Xaden and Violet are an already established relationship, I expected at least five sex scenes, but we got three. Okay, I\'ll admit, the throne scene was hot but only because of the setting. I wasn\'t excited by the dirty talk and, yeah, the smut was just lackluster in my opinion. It wasn\'t bad, just forgettable.It didn\'t feel like any character had enough time to go through any real development.I think this occurred because there were so many new characters introduced that the attention of the story was split. Or maybe it\'s also because the story is in Violet\'s POV and she pulled away from everyone, so since she wasn\'t as ingrained in their lives, she didn\'t notice changes/growth? I don\'t know, but I wish we could have had more time with Xaden, Rhi, and Sloane.There were a few things that didn\'t really get explained.For example, why wouldn\'t Brennan encourage Violet to do research on wards? Violet was trained as a Scribe and would be an excellent person to assign for this task. I get he didn\'t think they would have enough time to figure it out and he thought they should focus on making more weapons, but no one assigned Violet a mission, so why have her do nothing instead of possibly finding a solution to win the war? His logic wasn\'t full-proof. Also, the end where Brennan fixes the wardstone. . . we spent the entire book trying to understand wards and then figure out how to mend them and somehow Brennan does this but we don\'t see how? It better be explained in the next book and not glossed over. Also, why did Xaden become venin? In the dream he has, the Sage said it would save Violet from dying while she was draining herself for the wardstone, but I don\'t see how thats true. If you have any ideas please let me know. And random but can someone please make a timeline of when Xaden would have been able to have a relationship with Cat? Because according to my math, he would have been, like, 14 years old! There are even more situations that needed an explanation but I don\'t have the energy to go through them all.Overall, Iron Flame was a decent sequel. I enjoyed it. I was entertained. But it was messy, and left me wanting more and less at the same time. It should have been shorter, the plot should have been cleaned up a bit, and we should have spent more time with our favorite characters instead of being introduced to a shit ton of new characters (whom I\'m still not sure are important). It really is entertaining though, so if you enjoyed Fourth Wing, you\'ll probably enjoy this one, or at the very least, be able to push through it.

I didn’t see that coming and while it wasn’t Zodiac Academy cliffhanger level of bad, cuz let’s be real nothing will be as horrific as Shadow Princess or Heartless Sky cliffhanger 💀\xa0Iron Flame ending had me spiralling.. how tf will this issue be resolvedIFit can even be resolved I’M NOT OKAY 😭😭😭Fourth Wing was so action packed and fast paced with lots of “OMG”-moments like when Violet bonded not one but two dragons, finding out the dragon’s power, certain sacrifices etc. So compared to the first book Iron Flame is much slower plotwise. It starts where Fourth Wing left off and continues with Violet and co. going back to Basgiath College for their second year and act like mentors for the new first year students.🗡️VIOLET SORRENGAIL(h) 🗡️”Violence, remember it’s only the body that’s fragile. You are unbreakable.”I love Violet so much, but I think she struggled a lot in this book with her position in this world and what her purpose is. Violet has the best intentions at heart, but feels like she is failing everyone and I just wanted to give her a hug this whole book 😭\xa0when she said that she never failed anything in her life but now she keeps failing and making the wrong decisions I felt for her!!But Vi’s struggle were actually the part that made me love her more. Yes, she did make some questionable decisions in this book, but that’s what makes her character so realistic for me. She tries her best and sometimes her best isn’t enough, but this girlnevergives up. She will keep standing up no matter how many times she gets kicked down. She will find the solution to the problem no matter how many hours she will need to research, but she will do the work.That scene with her Varrish and Nolan and a certain other character whose name I can’t name killed me 😭\xa0it was so painful to read.. Violet was so strong for enduring everything and not losing her mind completely.. I would have folded so quickly 🌚\xa0Violet Sorrengail best girl. There is a reason she bonded not one, but two dragons. 💅🔹XANDEN RIORSON(H) 🔹“Violet.” His gaze rakes over my face, lingering on my cheeks. I love the way he says my name. Sure, it’s the alcohol overruling my logic, but I want to hear him say it again. “Lieutenant Riorson.”LIEUTENANT RIORSON Y’ALL. If you think WINGLEADER Xaden was hot wait til you get Xaden as a lieutenant that just hits differently 🛐\xa0He was so hot in this book.Xaden has still so many secrets we don’t know about and I think there is still so much to his story. Like where did his mother disappear? I’m still so intrigued by his character and now even more after that ending… I didn’t see that coming and I’m still shocked. I wish we would get more Xaden POVs in the books because the one at the end is never enough… with that ending I hope that Xaden will be more of a focus in the next book, cause I just want to know more about him.🐉TAIRN & ANDARNA (DRAGONS)🐉“A rolling dismount would tear you limb from limb on impact,” he retorts.“You don’t know that,” Andarna counters with what seems to be her new default form of conversation—telling Tairn he’s wrong. A growl rumbles through Tairn’s chest, vibrating the saddle beneath me and the harness that holds Andarna to his chest.“I’d watch it,” I tell her, biting back a smile. “He might get tired and drop you.”“His pride would never allow it.”“Says the dragon who spent twenty minutes refusing to put on her harness,” Tairn fires back.It would be a huge lie if I’d say I haven’t missed my sunshine princess Andarna in this book, because I did, but eventually all babies have to grow up and Andarna became a teenager 🥺\xa0her angsty teenager attitude towards Tairn had me laughing my ass off. I love their relationship so much and they are the best father-daughter duo. Their bond is so precious! When Andarna said she wanted to be just like Tairn, because he is loyal, fierce and strong it made me so emotional 😭😭\xa0And to my grumpy, firerce, strong and loyal dragon Tairn.. I can only say that I thought I couldn’t love him more after Fourth Wing, but I do now. The way Tairn protects Violet and stands by her side is everything. The relationship that the dragons have with their riders is *chef’s kiss*🧚THE ROMANCE🧚I meant what I said on the parapet. Even when I’m not with you, there’s only youMy violetxaden heart was so happy!! I mean I knew Violet would be really stubborn about the Xaden lying to her thing and would hold it against him for quite some time, but I loved the angst that created. But Xaden is completely smitten with her and we love to see an obsessed boy. Vi doesn’t think that he would choose her over the revolution, but she doesn’t realized that Xaden would burn down the world for her 😌\xa0he is not like that rule-following loser Dain .. Xaden would break every rule for her and the way Xaden is so worried for Vi and wants to protect her has my heart melting into a puddle 🥰Also can we talk about Xaden writing Violet letters while he is away?? that is so romantic and had me going 🥺\xa0I only wished we could have read more of his letters and not only small excerps. Don’t be shy Rebecca give us the full content.👫SIDE CHARACTERS👫Rhiannon:my queen i love you, it took me forever to remember you name, but now you better survive until the end or i will personally hunt Rebecca til the end of the worldRidoc:my comedic king i love youImogen: i love you my other kickass queenDain:fuck you, i haven’t forgiven you and i don’t think i willJesinia:what a cutie, i like her and she better stays loyal to Violet and doesn’t betray herCat:FUCK YOU, but in capital letters.Varrish:oh i hope someone fucks you with a 10 inch pole i fucking hate you. that c*nt… why does every magical school has a Professor Umbridge character that is so detestable. This man will answer for all his sins and the atrocities he commited against Violet. I hope this loser never finds a moment of peace.to the rest of the side characters: you were either irrelevant, i couldn’t remember you’re names or i refuse to remember to name, cause you going to die either way in this book or later.👯\u200d♀️VIOLET & MIRA & BRENNAN👯\u200d♀️the scene where Mira finds out that Brennan is alive and punches him in the face lives in my mind rent free. That’s my girl lmao cause I would react the same way if I’d find out one of my sibling pretended to be death for the last six years. I’D BE LIVID.But it was great to see all Sorrengail siblings back together. I love seeing them all together and get a glimpse of their different dynamics with each other. When Mira and Brennan were fighting and Violet was just standing next to them and felt like their little sister again dksdskd 😭\xa0I love them and they are all badasses in their own way.🔻WHY IRON FLAME WAS WEAKER THAN FOURTH WING IMO🔻↠ if Fourth Wing was Catching Fire (The Hunger Games) then I’d say that Iron Flame is Mockingjay in terms of action and pace. As I mentioned abovethis book is much more slower paced. It’s one of those books where a lot happens, but at the same time nothing at all, because they are trying to establish the rebellion, gather their tropes, find out more information how to raise the wards etc. So it deals with the characters getting to class and learning about magic etc. While a lot of people still die in this book, Iron Flame just didn’t feel as high staked imo as Fourth Wing did. Violet and her friends survived all the trials and first year, so I didn’t feel like I was constantly on the edge of my seat not knowing what will happen next. Don’t get me wrong there were many scenes that HAD ME STRESSED OUT and sweating, because it was intense, but it wasn’t intense as a whole as Fourth Wing and didn’t me give me as much nostalgia as Fourth Wing did.↠ theinfo-dumpingwas a bit much in this book. I think Fourth Wing had the perfect amount of world building and information. Iron Flame had a lot of information because the characters are going to class and learn about new magic and trying to gather info on how to raise wards and power the wardstone etc. and I get that it was important, but seeing them look for information, just to try it and fail and then having to continue their search was a bit exhausting.↠ some of the themes in this book were repetitive. Since Violet and Xaden couldn’t see each other a lot in the first half of the book I ate up every scenes they had together, but the things they were fighting over were always the same.. Violet not being able to trust him, them not being able to proper communicate with each other, Violet complaining about Xaden lying and having too many secrets .. that was pretty much the root of every single fight they had. Their push and pull was a bit tiring to read at the beginning cause they had the same argument over and over again.CONCLUSIONFourth Wing was a perfect book for me and a 10 outta 10 so even though Iron Flame didn’t reach that level for me and had quite some flaws, it was still an enjoyable book to read and I love love love this world so much with the dragon and magic and harry potter vibes. I love this series and after that brutal ending I need the next book in my hands right now. Praying that we don’t have to wait a whole year for the next book to come out.P.S: What is the author going to write in the next THREE books?! We are already in the middle of fighting against the venin and wyvern and I hope RY doesn’t drag out the storyline too much and makes it another Zodiac Academy situation 💀┍━━━━━━━━»•» «•«━┑THE EMPYREAN SERIES#1 Fourth Wing –\xa05 stars#2Iron Flame–\xa04 stars┕━»•» «•«━━━━━━━━┙'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '0/5 ⭐️ you thought Fourth Wing was bad…? Oh you sweet summer child.Goodreads has been real finicky about reviews recently so I will only be speaking on the book and its content (not the author though I have very many opinions (none of them kind☺️))also there are spoilers in this review but who cares because you shouldn’t be reading this book to begin with! (Don’t let my sacrifice be in vain)I intended to get this review out way sooner but unfortunately (and unsurprisingly) this book was actually so much worse than Fourth Wing!🥳I naively assumed Fourth Wing would be the top contender for worst book of the year but Iron Flame made me wish I was reading Fourth Wing!!At least Fourth Wing had the decency to be short enough to get through in a week, Iron Flame takes every flaw of Fourth Wing and not only makes it worse but makes it LONGER(???!?!) while somehow simultaneously being even more boring! Wow!🤩 Good job Yarros!!! What a fantasy icon!!🧝🏻\u200d♀️Remember how Fourth Wing had one of the most idiotic, and juvenile writing styles in any adult fantasy book ever? Imagine that but now in a world where editing was never invented!! 🥰The sentence structure was legitimately horrendous. I actually wish I was kidding.If you have the unfortunate displeasure of being in a twenty mile radius of a copy of Iron Flame and are unlucky enough to stroll past it in the store or your local library, I beg you, after you recover from the sheer horror of being in the same room as such an abomination to fantasy, open it to a random page and just ATTEMPT to read a paragraph out loud.I am a creative writing major, I read books out loud all the time. I have never struggled so much with a book in my entire life. Sincerely whoever had to do the audio book must have the endurance and the mental fortitude of a saint.Forgive me, Yarros, for believing reading should be an enjoyable experience, clearly you do not agree. 🧎\u200d♀️Also Yarros used 493 ellipses and 1089 em-dashes on my count! The book is about 634 pages!💫And oh! A Drinking game🥂: take a shot every time a character’s eyebrow or brow or brows are mentioned!! Actually don’t! You’d definitely die! Brows are mentioned over a hundred times!!🫠 I have to laugh (or else I might scream) at the idea that THIS is accessible fantasy because not only is the plot and the world building convoluted and unengaging but the writing is so incredibly shit that it makes you reread half of the sentences over again if you want to the vaguest inkling of an idea of what is going on in this horseshit world. To call Iron Flame accessible spits in the face of twenty plus years of hard work and effort by truly talented authors to make fantasy books that are actually welcoming and accessible to a wide audience.Let’s actually talk about the plot. Fourth Wing was derivative and predictable and Iron Flame doesn’t even try to be any more.Here’s a list of some 🌈✨creative😍 plot points Yarros used:- A shitty copycat version of the Hunger Game’s rebellion (with zero of the interesting nuance or intelligent discourse)😯- what is essentially a boring Umbridge at a half-assed attempt to create tension😧- The Rider Quadrant and the Infantry Quadrant finally interact!! They are dropped in the middle of a forest, are being hunted by dragons, and are given two maps and told to go to a location marked on the maps! A simple assignment for students at a war school who surely know how to navigate using a map because that’s an important skill for soldiers to know, right?! 🗺️ Not only do these riders not learn how to read a map until year two (WHY?) but apparently the Infantry and Riders hate each other so much😠 that THEY DON’T EVEN COMPARE THE TWO MAPS WHEN PEOPLE HAVE CONFLICTING IDEAS ABOUT WHERE THEY ARE. THEY WALK AROUND IN A FOREST FOR HOURS INSTEAD OF COLLABORATING ONCE. I don’t care how much you hate someone at school, if you are given a group assignment literally step one is compare all documents you have been given so you can be done as quickly as possible. ALSO WHEN ONE OF THE INFANTRY ASKS TO WHAT TO SO IN THE EVEN OF A DRAGON ATTACK THE RIDERS LAUGH AND MAKE FUN OF THEM FOR BEING SCARED??? THEN WHEN A DRAGON ATTACKS THE RIDERS ARE MAD AT THE INFANTRY FOR DOING THE WRONG THING AFTER THEY LITERALLY WERE NOT TOLD WHAT TO DO!! Yarros when I find you Yarros Yarros when I find you Yarros🏃\u200d♀️🏃\u200d♀️- Jack Barlow back because I guess Yarros couldn’t come up with another new antagonist… also he’s Venin for reasons. Really it’s not that interesting. The resurrection trope is so fun!!🤩🤗- A torture scene summary that is not scary in the slightest because this book conditions you to know that Violet is never in any real danger despite trying to tell you she is always on the verge of death 😱- A visit to what is essentially the Summer Court in search the Book of some bullshit thing called a luminary (btw we don’t even know what it looks like until 60% through the book AFTER they’ve acquired it???)🤫- a catty ex-girlfriend (named Cat, wow ✨creative✨) making a reappearance and doing nothing but promotes wonderful stereotypes (even though Yarros tries really hard to tell you it doesn’t on page the literal page)💃🏻- and the most anticlimactic and boring battle with the dumbest ending I’ve ever read!! 🤺There are more stupid plot points, but I’m getting brain damage trying to remember the plot of this book so I’m just going to talk about things that made me wish I was attempting to consume whole boulders rather than read the most accessible fantasy book of all time: Iron Flame by Rebecca Yarros😇Varrish. He’s our Umbridge lookalike. He strolls into the Dragon Rider Academy and he’s super scary with his one-eyed dragon Solas!!! 😰I mean he would have been, but literally the first time he does anything scary by letting his dragon incinerate an entire squad, TAIRN FLYS IN AND THREATENS SOLAS. AND SOLAS AND VARRISH BOTH COWER BECAUSE TAIRN IS SO BIG AND SUPER SCARY AND THE 🌈✨⭐️MoST PoWErFuL⭐️✨🌈 DraGOn😀Well maybe this is understandable because Solas just killed like twenty people, right?🤔 But no! Tairn isn’t mad about that, he’s mad because Violet got like a first degree burn.I don’t know what Yarros was attempting to achieve with this scene but you know what it does achieve? It tells the reader that Varrish isn’t actually a scary villain because having Tairn put him in his place the moment he does a single villainous action. IT DESTROYS ALL TENSION YOU COULD HAVE HAD.🧍🏻\u200d♀️And don’t you worry, dearest reader, this is a trend. LATER TAIRN MAKES VARRISH GET ON HIS KNEES AND APOLOGIZE TO VIOLET FOR BEING MEAN TO HER. ⁉️⁉️IN FACT ANYTIME ANYONE IS MEAN TO VIOLET THE ENTIRE WORLD COMES TO HER DEFENSE. Any character, any dragon, I swear to god a speck of dust could land on Violet wrong and the entire cast of characters would jump them. And it’s not just her friends. THE SIDE CHARACTERS, MAIN CHARACTERS, CHARACTERS WITH LITERALLY A SINGLE LINE OF DIALOGUE, MINOR AND MAIN ANTAGONISTS.THEY ALL COMPLIMENT VIOLETC O N S T A N T L Y.VARRISH COMPLIMENTS HER, THE VENIN COMPLIMENT HER, CAT COMPLIMENTS HER.Sloane (the sister of Liam, the stupid dead guy👱🏻\u200d♂️ that Violet tries to convince us was her friend) says the most benign of comments against Violet and Rhiannon and every other personality-devoid lampshade of a character in a seven mile vicinity practically threatens to jump this GRIEVING 20 year old girl.Characters that Violet doesn’t even know will compliment her out of the blue.THE BOOK READS LIKE AN INSECURE PERSON WISH FUFILLMENT. 💇\u200d♀️It’s so unbelievably unbearable. 👹The Violet Defense Squad™️ is literally in every chapter. My favorite part about this book was that I couldn’t find a chapter where Violet isn’t complimented for doing literally nothing in any of all 66 chapters of the entire book.🤭🤩And in case you were concerned that anyone who was mean to Violet would get interesting character development, nope! They either end up dead or want to be her friend by the end🥰 awesome!😎 Violet is my favorite character😍Are you interested in Violet’s character arc? Well let me tell you the wonderful highs of this perfect character that we’re supposed to root for and support!!😘Violet starts out strong by making insane demands of Xaden like demanding he tell her literally everything even though she had her mind read last book! And she doesn’t just mention this once. She mentions this every single time we see Xaden. She doesn’t trust him, she tells us, but she loves him, she tells us. 🙄 They’re such a cute and believable and interesting couple 🥰🥰 and their dynamic is made so much better by that random ex-girlfriend that was included because Yarros got bored I guess!😍On top of being annoying and insecure, Violet decided that this book she would also double down on being one the worst people imaginable! Remember when all those people Violet considered friends died in her first year and she was so sad about that?Well actually this book Violet tells us that she’s gained some new perspective!!🤯Actually she’s glad all those people died because watching all those people die made her a better rider because they inspired her to… not die(?)! Because that’s a normal and morally good thing for our main character that is SO empathetic and SO kind to say!🙈 Violet is so good, I wish I was just like her!!!☺️Also remember Sloane and her dead brother?!👱🏻\u200d♂️ Well Liam spent all of book one writing letters to Sloane, his only living family! Wouldn’t it be so nice if Violet gave those to Sloane out of the kindness and goodness of her heart to help Sloane cope with the loss of her older brother?!😊 Well she didn’t!!Violet withheld the letters for weeks after Sloane arrived at the school, (weeks in which Sloane very well could have died by the way) and only offered to give Sloane the letters if she agreed to train with Imogen (a girl Sloane does not like) and only agreed to give her one letter a week!! There are over fifty letters Violet! What happens if Sloane dies during a freak accident which you KNOW are rampant at this death school???! Violet is such an empath guys🥺 she really understands and cares for the people around her.😣 Don’t you wish you were just like her?!😁Violet also does a variety of things such as:- Dropping a gryphon flier off the side of a cliff and then being surprised when said gryphon flier’s friends don’t like her? Inspirational💫- Talking shit on the infantry for not trusting dragons and being cowards after literally being a prime example as to why the infantry should not trust riders or their dragons! So empathetic🥺- Wanting to murder Xaden’s ex for saying a couple of barely mean comments to her! A totally rational response!!!👍- Trying to translate a journal from a dead language she doesn’t know (she does know many other dead languages, of course) instead of giving it to the girl that she’s knows understands that dead language! Wow! the smartest main character of our generation! 🤯- Accusing every scholar and student of the school of perpetuating misinformation and hiding history that she herself just found out about! She’s so kind and thoughtful 🥳- Forgetting instantly about her friend who got her neck snapped after some assassin asked who Violet Sorrengail was. She cares so much about her friends!👯\u200d♀️- And many, many more abhorrent things🤩In case you forgot (because apparently Yarros did 90% of the book) Violet has EDS. Sometimes it’s brought up, but not really with any substance. And Violet just wraps her joints and “pushes through it” and “puts all her pain into a box” (??) and pretends she doesn’t have a problem at all. No further accommodations are granted to her in this book aside from the saddle from last book which is already dumb because everyone trying to hold onto a flying creature should be using saddles anyway.I highly suggest: Fly Or Die: The Ableist Narrative of Toxic Perseverance by Ella T Holmes for a much better explanation than I can provide as someone that doesn’t have EDS.Let’s talk about Xaden because if I have to think about how super special and powerful and amazing Violet is I might eat all the gravel in my backyard. Xaden’s depiction in this book is gross to say the least.Rebecca has confirmed that he’s a PoC which is great!Keeping that in mind, I love how he’s described as incapable of love and is called a monster and is untrustworthy!!😍😍And I absolutely adore that our super special and talented basic white girl Violet is the person that shows him true love and trust and is the only person who can take his mask of cruelty and violence off for the first time even though she’s so much smaller and weaker than big, strong, powerful Xaden. It’s so cool that all the other characters are so terrified of him and that he acts as little more than Violet’s big overprotective and jealous guard dog! I especially love that Violet’s mom practically tortured him and gave him a hundred and something scars and that he has to take responsibility for all of the marked ones!! That’s not concerning and horrific!!!! And I love that he also got another scar for “claiming” Violet!! that’s so attractive and romantic and good representation and not at all fetishizing men of color at all!!!🥰🥰🥰 Thank you so much for your hard work Yarros!!!🫡He’s also annoying and refuses to tell Violet anything unless she asks hyper specific questions. Their whole dynamic is just annoying and stupid.And I love all of Yarros’ other characters who have less personality than paper bags with faces drawn on them!!🪑 Frankly a folding chair has more charm than any of the characters in this book.They’re so unique and are definitely really funny and don’t ever bog down the scenes with so many characters that you can’t tell who is even talking anymore! They’re all unique and dynamic with character arcs!! Of course! What else would they be?😆And the dragons! 🐉 Oh the dragons! How could I forget about the dragons that are nothing but glorified Uber rides!! They don’t do shit but posture and growl and be boring!Here’s some fun facts about dragons: dragons can choose their tail shape but they can’t choose their color which directly influences their personality and temperament!!All baby dragons are gold because that’s interesting! Is there an evolutionary reason for that or something? Not that we’re told of!More dragon sex is mentioned, thankfully we don’t have to live through the dragon-lust again though!Also the dismounts that Rebecca describes the Riders doing are literally physically impossible!! All the riders should be dead if they try to pull that shit! Giant flying dragons are not horses you can’t just walk around on it while it’s diving and jump off of it😭😭Oh and Anadarna also is now like a super special purple/chameleon never before seen breed of dragon with the rarest tail shape!🐲 Are we surprised? No. Just bored. 😴She also now has like a disabled/malformed wing. Her wings were fine in the first book, but now they’re not? Idk. I feel like that should have been a thing in book one but whatever. (Tairn literally blames it on Violet which is sort of hilariously fucked up??) But anyway she obviously can still fly because god forbid a disability ever hinder a character in anyway that makes them adapt, but she can’t ever hold a rider? Violet is like 90 pounds as we are so graciously reminded so I feel like if Andarna gets bigger she definitely should be able to carry her but whatever. 🤷\u200d♀️TLDR: the dragons are BORING. And they’re not even funny or cool or even scary. Why write about dragons if you make them boring and insignificant to the plot??! And Andarna is a special-special because of course she is. 🤪This review is getting way too long so let’s just talk about the ending.Oh no! Violet’s mom that got no real development or anything died! Anyway. 🧐Why the fuck did the revolution refuse to help Navarre? They claim to be morally superior and to care about the lives of civilians but just blatantly ignore like 50% of the continent’s population because they’re Navarre citizens? And we’re supposed to root for them? Right! Awesome! Okay!😆👍What are the actual morals of the revolution? What is their end goal? Why did Violet join them so quickly without asking any questions??🫠She’s so intelligent!🤓I’m completely fine with Xaden becoming Venin, though I doubt it will be resolved in an interesting way. Though I don’t think it’s really an interesting plot twist and I saw it coming a mile away after all the boring Venin info dumping I had to sit through, but at least it’s something.HOWEVER I CANNOT FORGIVE IT FOR MAKING THE FINAL LINES OF THE BOOK“Welcome to our fucked-up family. Guess we’re brothers now.”THE SECOND TO LAST LINE IN THE BOOK IS “WELCOME TO OUR FUCKED UP FAMILY”😭😭😭😭😭WHAT WHAT WHATDO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT DID TO ME??I READ 634 PAGES OF THE WORST, MEANDERING, BULLSHIT PLOT POINTS, HORRIFIC AND BORING SEX SCENES, INDECIPHERABLE INFO DUMPS, NONSENSICAL MAGIC SYSTEMS, FLAT CHARACTERS, BORING DRAGONS, HORRIBLE REPRESENTATION, AGGRESSIVELY UNFUNNY FRAT BOY HUMOR, UNEDITED GARBAGE AND YOU END IT WITH “WELCOME TO OUR FUCKED UP FAMILY”???????????????!!!!!!!!!!!?!?!?!!?!??!ARE YOU TRYING TO GIVE ME A JOKER ARC??? WAS THAT THE POINT OF THIS BOOK????AM I SUPPOSED TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY AS AN ACTUAL FANTASY BOOK???THE REASON THIS BOOK TOOK ME SO LONG TO REVIEW IS BECAUSE I GOT ACTUAL PSYCHIC DAMAGE FROM THE LAST LINES OF THIS BOOK.I HYPERVENTILATED I THREW MY PHONE I SCREAMED I STARED AT A WALL AND CONTEMPLATED MY PLACE AND PURPOSE ON THIS EARTHI HAD MORE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT THAN ANY CHARACTER IN THIS ENTIRE BOOK IN THE 0.5 SECONDS AFTER READING THOSE LINESHOW AM I SUPPOSED TO REACT TO THAT??DID YARROS THINK SHE ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING WITH THAT ENDING??HAVE I LOST MY MIND?? PEOPLE LIKE THIS BOOK? PEOPLE TAKE IT SERIOUSLY AND MAKE UP THEORIES FOR IT??? WHAT??????GENUINELY IF YOU LIKE THIS BOOK WHY? WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? ARE YOU OKAY? DO YOU NEED HELP?WELCOME TO OUR FUCKED UP FAMILY??? GUESS WE’RE BROTHERS NOW???YARROS I AM LIVING IN YOUR WALLS WHAT DO YOU MEAN WELCOME TO OUR FUCKED UP FAMILY WHAT DO YOU MEAN😭😭😭😭😭😭I FEEL LIKE I AM ENTITLED TO FINANCIAL COMPENSATION FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL DAMAGE THIS BOOK HAS INFLICTED UPON MEso thanks for reading my review <3 I hope this helps your decision making process when it comes to buying books :) (don’t buy this book) Yarros did not receive any financial compensation for my suffering and I highly recommend that if you want to read this book (for some reason??? Why?? I spent so long writing this to give you reasons not to!😭) you get it from your library or literally any other means.Red Tower and Yarros are not people that deserve your hard earned money or support.Also whoever the fuck claimed to have edited this book is a world class scammer because they got paid for doing literally nothing. But also they should be fired and exiled and never allowed to look at words again.I have more to say but I hit the word limit💀'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Because love, at its root, is hope.

That shit is harder to kill than a dragon.Well, fuck🥲That being said, I promised myself I'd finish my current readings before starting this one, but FoMo was a bitch and then, would you believe that, I tripped and fell into Xadaddy's arms.Silly, clumsy me.Iron Flame was alright, but I'm not crazy about it.I found the writing even more YAish than it was in Fourth Wing and I, painfully, have to admit I feel the same about the romance.I don't know if maybe, when I first read Fourth Wing, I was in a place, mentally speaking, where my reader needs were more than met despite the flaws, but it seems like I can't overlook them with the sequel.Being completely honest, the plot does pick up after the first half and the romance has its up and downs all through the story, but it never reaches the point where I felt like giving up on it completely.The smut was fine and the tension well written, but I'm not a fan of Yarros's idea of spicy dialogues.The one liners, sometimes, made me cringe a little, and the characterization of the main characters left me a tad confused, at times, especially at the beginning. I couldn't follow the story properly because I felt like Violet was thinking one thing then acting in a completely opposite way.Speaking of Violet...When I read FW, I thought Yarros'd made her a bit of a Mary Sue, but that was okay, because she had obvious flaws, even she was aware of, to balance her randomly having every special skill on the menu and succeding in every single task she was burdened with.Iron Flame Violet is a total badass and she's definitely grown a lot, but she also feels a little incomplete and rough at the edges. I don't know if it's intentional and/or tied to her future evolution, but I wouldn't have minded her being more confident, especially when it comes to her relationship with Xaden.Xaden is still daddy, in case you're asking, and he was a total dreamboat, the ultimate book boyfriend from start to finish.Like I've mentioned before, I wasn't really sure about the romance, at first. I wanted more grovelling and Violet's constant thirsting over Xaden's fine behind gave me a headache. It gave me major early Tory/Darius vibes, and if you're a fan of Zodiac Academy, you'll get what I mean.Thankfully, things took a pleasant turn when I reached the second part and I wasn't only rooting for them, I was absolutely feral when everything mined their eventual happiness.This works for the plot as well. In the first half, I wasn't really enjoying myself and could count on one hand the moments I actually found interesting.But then shit hit the fan, twists started piling up and every page turned was an angsty fest I totally wanted to attend. I devoured the second half in hours and when I reached the end, just felt like staring at the wall.And have a mojito or two.I definitely didn't see THAT coming.Another thing I really appreciated, aside from the chef's kiss perfect action scenes and THE SASSY DRAGONS (omg my baby Andarna!!!), were the secondary characers. Violet and Xaden's friends deserve their own books - Rhi in particular <3<3<3< - and I definitely hope the sequels will focus on them more, especially because some characters are only now starting to blossom and they seem particularly interesting.I also would like to take advantage of this topic to admit I never really hated Dain. I'm pretty passive when it comes to him, but I swear to god, if RY takesthatdirection, I'm gonna throw a fit.Overall, this was, for me, a decent sequel, albeit an unnecessarily long one.If you loved FW but are having trouble with it like I did, I recommend pushing through it.All in all, it's pretty worth it.I'll leave under the spoiler tag some sort of disclaimer because, even though I usually try my best to stay clear of any kind of drama and hate brining real life politics into my bookish heaven, I've been harassed for a couple days both in public and in private because of my choice to give this book a chance, so for the first and last time in my permanence here on this site, I'll go out of my usual way and discuss things I usually never discuss on GR, after all.I'm aware of the controversy surrounding this author and this book series.I'm not ignoring the problem, I'm simply choosing to keep my thoughts on the matter private and my general beliefs silent, except for serious situations that require me to speak up about them out loud or environments where I know judgement or opposition would come in a respectful manner and not in the form of bullying and name calling.Unfortunately, that doesn't always seem to be the case here on GR, these days.I'm publicly choosing to read this book acknowledging what's going on behind the scenes, and my review will simply be that: an objective and honest book review like the hundreds I've written before, as my hobby and favorite pastime.It won't nor shouldn't be my opinion telling others what they can or can't, should or shouldn't read in their free time and how to use their money or to consume the media they purchased.If I had that type of influence, I most certainly wouldn't be spending my spare moments reviewing books for free.Iam choosing, for myself, to leave a review that has nothing to do with the person who wrote this book or her political views, and it's between me, my objectivity and my conscience to decide how this will play out.I don't need to state this, but before anyone starts throwing around terms and essays, my support and prayers go out to people who are suffering. I chose to do something about the delicate and important matters we're discussing (and those conflicts and natural catastrophes I rarely see discussed here, because, guess what? 1) it's GoodREADS not GoodWORLDWIDENEWS and 2) the world sucks everywhere and it's been sucking for a really long time), but you won't hear me being vocal about it, because I've learnt you don't have to boast about your actions and contributions to be a good person. That sometimes those who are lousy and loud with words, just like the idea of being good without really acting on it.I'm choosing to help whoever I feel needs helping in a way that's suited to my personal beliefs and that has nothing to do with the books I prefer to engage with.I'm choosing to remain neutral when it comes to sharing political views on a site dedicated to book tracking; war and death are a reality I'll never turn away from.And if separating art from the artist isn't a tolerated choice, I hope keeping my private life and my reader life separate will be more understandable.I hope those who disagree with my choice to refrain from sharing my political views, will give me the benefit of the doubt, as I'll try to do with them and their ideals.If you wanna talk politics or discuss what an author has or hasn't done, my comment section isn't the place.

Not that this one wasn\'t great, but it didn\'t give the same feelings as the first one did when it hooked me instantly because of the Parapet scene.Many things didn\'t work for me.The start of this book wasn\'t as exciting... (she was eating freaking biscuits). And Brennan\'s revealation and all were just so avg and boring? A lot of info dumps too. The Dragons made this book better.The first 30% of this book is filled with \'You don\'t trust me enough\' drama between Xaden and Vi, which was seriously getting on my nerves.I get that she\'s hurt, but she was being absolutely ridiculous, demanding info while withholding it as a form of retaliation. Her inner monologue about being a \'bad friend\' and always \'feeling guilty\' for lying again and again was constantly on repeat. NO ACTION NOTHING NADA.

This freaking drama grated on my nerves, and I was tired of how much this phrase was used. LIKE STOP? Everybody knew that Xaden is not sharing everything just to protect her life, and to a certain extent, I understand Violet, and I agree with her.but she\'s being so immature and whiny, and I swear this book just kind of ruined her character in many ways because she was always back to this old topic, and they constantly fought each other, and Violet constantly defied Xaden again and again (as in risking her life) and then made up eventually.The author really tried to put angst into their story with smut, but tbh I DO NOT PREFER THEM AS A COUPLE (at least not rn). The love was too quick, and the amount of trust issues, insecurities, and fights they had was so wrong and unhealthy. Xaden was being protective of her and hiding truths from her for her OWN SAFETY! and saying from experience, fantasy girlies do not like overprotective bfs. AND ADDING CATRIONA IN IT? That was the worst! The whole ex-jealousy thing was insane. and if this keeps going on, I don\'t think XadenVi will be the endgame (there are 5 books ffs)• side characters:For me,Rhiannonstole the show. She\'s so mature and amazing? and I love her sm! How she kept calm and been patient and supported Violet, and she\'s so damn skillful? SHE DESERVED APPRECIATION AND I\'M GLAD SHE GOT IT.

I\'m glad his character got recognized a lot in this book!Varrishsoooo weirddd sooo creepyyyyy! 👺 I hated him so much and what he did with Violet? HE DESERVED A PAINFUL DEATH WTH!

I read many times and I came with a seizure because why are they even added? A second reread would help, but I won\'t go there anytime soon. A lot of elements of this book were so weird that I prefer book 1 A LOT!what the actual fuckery?(the ending ofcourse)I can finally sleep now as I haven\'t slept more than 5 hours just to finish this book.I\'m sorry but I didn\'t know about this author being zionist when I read this book and I didnt contribute to her financially and all as I read the pirated version.

This was incredibly disappointing...I don’t even really know where to start with this review, because I feel like I have so many complaints.First and foremost, let’s start with one of the book’s most glaring issues: the writing was genuinelybad. It’s as plain and simple as that. This whole thing dragged like crazy and I was just so bored most of the time. Not only that, the writing was also painfully shallow. Nothing and no one had depth: all of the characters were completely one-dimensional and the plot failed to be interesting or engaging in any way.Speaking of the characters, let’s go on with my complaints by talking about our failure of a main character. I don’t know what happened to Violet between this one and the previous book, but I don’t recognize her whatsoever. She used to be the perfect balance of kind and bad-ass with a clever and sharp mind to boot! But now this girl we all knew and loved disappeared completely and instead we got this whiny, insecure idiot without a single rational thought going on inside that annoying brain of hers. I suddenly couldn’t stand her anymore!Same goes for Xaden: he suffered from major character assassination as well. He used to be strong, smart, mysterious, intriguing, and swoony as hell, but that was all gone now. Xaden turned into the most flat character ever, and he had no depth whatsoever. He truly felt like a robot to me, and I lost all interest in him. He is gone for most of the book, and at first I really missed his presence, but after a while, I was just bored every time he came on page, because I knew he would be the same repetitive and annoying character he was during all his other scenes, so I kind of didn’t care anymore if he was gone or not.The fact that both Violet and Xaden turned into insufferable characters is probably a big reason as to why their romance was terrible in this book too. First of all, after the end of the first book Ineededto get some groveling from Xaden, but did we get that here? No. Not even for a second. Xaden wasn’t sorry, he wasn’t regretful, he wasn’t trying to earn back Violet’s trust. No. He didn’t do anything. He didn’t even fight for Violet to forgive him. He was just... waiting. Not lifting a single finger to get back the woman he supposedly loves. He was so cocky in knowing that Violet would crawl back to him anyway that he refused to do anything to speed up the process. He just waited. And I guess he was right, because our spine-less heroine did indeed take him back without getting anything in return: no promises, no trust. Just nothing.Which obviously leads to a very unhealthy relationship between them where they don’t trust each other and in which they refuse to communicate. EVER. All they do is be horny and have sex, but they never actually talk anymore. They don’t confide in each other and neither do they let themselves fully open up to the other. Their entire relationship was just shallow, boring and irritating. I no longer liked anything about it. And then we even got some goddamn other woman drama, and my patience just vanished! I hated it.Now, when it comes to the side characters I don’t even know where to begin, because I feel like none of them were written well or with any depth to them. It’s like the author could never seem to focus on more than a few characters at the same time, so whenever she wanted to pay attention to one side character, all the other side characters just fell away. For example: at the beginning of this book we have quite a lot of focus on Imogen, and I was really seeing some amazing progress between her and Violet. I thought I saw the start of a beautiful friendship forming between them. But then, the moment Rhiannon started coming back into the fold (after being ignored in the first part), Imogen completely fell away again and her relationship with Violet never picked up. It’s like the author couldn’t handle Violet having more than one close female friend; she couldn’t focus on both at the same time. And therefore, neither Imogen or Rhiannon ever truly felt like friends to Violet because they were often suddenly ignored in her inner monologue or in the story. They were more like decoration, like tools to further the story along. Thus, none of Violet’s friends ever feel like real characters on their own..I loved the dragons in the first book; they were my favourite part of the entire book. But now, I couldn’t care less. Tairn used to be this sassy, grumpy dad-type, but now he was just a flat, monotone character with no real personality. Everything he said was repetitive, and his entire character just seemed way too simple and lacking any sort of depth. When it came to Andarna, I genuinely think her entire character was butchered. She used to be this cute and precious little baby, and now she turned into someone annoying, bitchy and arrogant without any meaningful connection to Violet. She was like an entitled teenager, and there’s a reason why nobody likes those.Of course, there were also other characters of whom I was really looking forward to seeing their story develop, but I didn’t get anything remotely satisfying when it came to them. Liam’s sister was only in a few scenes and in most of them she was just flat-out exasperating; everything about her character was anti-climactic.More importantly however, I feel like Dain just got completely ignored during this entire book. He used to be Violet’s best friend for such a long time and after it is revealed he didn’t even really do anything to betray her, Violet doesn’t remotely seem to care?? She doesn’t think about him and she doesn’t give him the time of day... she sort of forgives him but not really?? It was so weakly developed and I honestly expected more. It was, once again, very anti-climactic.Long story short, the only reason I somewhat enjoyed this book, and why I even finished it, is because I still felt a semblance of attachment to the story and these characters after book one, but even that wasn’t enough to keep me engaged for long enough. I couldn’t help but skim near the end of this book, because I was just so bored. I genuinely didn’t care anymore, and this book was just way too long for no reason.

Yet it was so enjoyable and exciting. I loved it in all its imperfections. Xaden and Violet have my heart and the series seems to be getting darker and more powerful. But oh how I ate it all up 🤭Was it better than Fourth Wing?The plot certainly was better but I do think people will find its execution a bit messy in general.Is it binge worthy?Absolutely, you just need time.So A LOT happens in this one, in fact way more than the first book.This book is so action packed and relationship focused, I didn\'t think I could love this series more but I really do.The best part about this was Tairn and Andarna. No one can tell me otherwise. I came in to love Xaden and Violet but the dragons... AHHHH 😩😩❤The book picks up immediately after the events of Fourth Wing and with no time wasted we jump into the story. Iliked the addition of new charactersand the way they all had their own personalities yet never overpowering.Felixand his sarcastic arse was top notch. I liked how he kept things real. I do believe the transition ofSolane\'sissues with Violet could have been smoothened a bit considering how strong she came to be. I absolutely LOATHEDVarrish.He\'s the equivalent of Umbridge I swear. Hated, hated, hated him. Those who have read Fourth Wing know, am not mentioning one of the characters, but I\'ll just say- his dynamic with Violet was chef\'s kiss 🤌""I want you exactly how you are, emotions and all. I want the woman I fell for...""🩶I lovedXadenand Violet.The groveling and reassurance THROUGHOUT the book was everything!!So we all know how things were left in Fourth Wing, and I expected Xaden to grovel his way for a few pages but our girl Violet made him grovel the whole time and I LOVED it. He was patient with her, he took his time with her. He made mistakes in this one too but he owned up to it and gave her answers.❤️\u200d🔥She had 100 questions? He answered them all. She asked the same question a million times? He answered it each and every damn time. Someone tried to make her jealous? He confidently claimed and assured her every time. Yeah, exactly! That\'s the kind of man he is 🤭😌⚡I adoredVioletin this. Let\'s be honest, there will be a lot of people who will find her annoying and insecure in this one. I personally did not. To me it made sense. Everyone lied to her throughout her whole life. Almost every new person wants to kill her. She lost someone very close to her. Her issues with Cat although wasn\'t really necessary but made sense. It gave Xaden and Violet the opportunity to become confident in each other and gave the opportunity to trust each other again. I loved Violet was patient and open towards Xaden, well eventually 🤭🐉Now let\'s get tomy babies- Tairn and Andarna.Y\'all if you adored them in the last book? You will LOVE them in this. Tairn was his sarcastic self, caring self and always giving his Silver One wisdom. I absolutely LOVED Andarna. Her adolescent self was so snarky, it was adorable. I wanted to protect them both, and especially my baby Andarna. Her reveals(Yes, multiple reveals 👀)had me gasping. I can\'t wait to see what else is in store for them.🔥Theside characters- Ridoc, Sawyer, Imogen and Rhiwere such good friends. The way they supported Violet through thick and thin. They had each other\'s backs. Sawyer and Jesina? They\'ll be cute together if it happens 🤭 These four kept me laughing. They made the two main characters real and brought life to the book. B and Mira 🫡🤡Dain and Cat-Bro now idk what to think about them 😭😩 It feels weird. No they\'re not a couple or anything, just two idiotic characters....""I would have done the same thing you did because I\'m just as reckless for you as you are for me.""The romance. The spice. The action. The plot twists. The drama. The reveals. The writing. PERFECT🤭🤭 I believe the torture scenes and the training bits were the best written parts as it showed how deep all of their bond was. Butthat one scene(can\'t spoil) had me bawling my eyes out, so heart touching and I just wanted to hold and hug him 😭😭😭❤ Those who have read it will know 😭The reveals at theendtho OH MY GOSHHHH. Yes it\'s true I got spoiled for the ending but I didn\'t let it get to me. I was bummed but I ate it up because of how well Rebecca Yarros wrote it. The action was so good!! I couldn\'t put the book down at all. The cliffhanger tho 😭😭😭😭DAMN BRUTAL. DAMN. BRUTAL.Am gonna be obsessed with the next one too 😩😩 Can\'t wait for it.Be kind on the review.

It would be quite easy. Just get rid of the constant repetitive repetitious:“How am I supposed to really love you if I don’t know you?”and“He doesn’t trust me.” I shrug. “And I can’t really trust him. It’s complicated.”Because, god, it\'sreally notthat complicated. The romantic will they/won\'t they mostly played out inFourth Wing(of course they will) so having to sit through loads of faux love angst about ""oh, Xaden, how can I know you? How can I trust you? Fuck, you have a hot ass"" was so boring. Not to mention the fact that Yarros\' smutty talk is kinda cringe.I was so so close to skimming during the first half BUT I have to say I thought the book went on to redeem itself a lot in the second half.The politics and magic of this world are surprisingly quite interesting when they manage to rear their head in between Violet and Xaden\'s theatrics. Yarros developed side characters further and I really came to love the camaraderie between Violet, Rhi, Sawyer and Ridoc, as well as the developing relationships and tensions with new characters. I love the voices of the dragons. I enjoyed Varrish as a villain (one of the few things I did enjoy about the first half.)When we reached the battles at the climax of the novel, I couldn\'t look away. The action scenes were suspenseful and dramatic and the ending, though a bit predictable, made me actually interested in reading the next book.I admit I was shocked to discover three more books are planned.

I\'m going to need a moment to process all this.Many moments later...Right, onto my thoughts.Allow me a second to gush here. I love it when a book knows what it\'s there to do, and that is to entertain the reader. It isn\'t there to be slow or boring or god forbid, pretentious (shudders). Rather, its goal is to squeeze every ounce of joy and delight out of the pages, and that\'s what this series does best.Cracking open the first page, I was sucked right back into the world of Navarre and Violet Sorrengail. It\'s as if I\'ve never left it. Everything I loved from the first book is here—nonstop action, characters I could root for, snarky dragons, and sizzling romance. I couldn\'t turn the pages fast enough.The only thing I didn\'t love was our main couple having squabbles for half the book over reasons I couldn\'t make heads or tails of. I get that Rebecca Yarros has to inject some sort of strife between them to keep things interesting, but I was just confused. But if it\'s that or hundreds of pages of lovey-dovey mush, I guess I\'ll take confounding couple problems any day.I always have a sliver of trepidation going into book 2 of a series. What if my enjoyment of the first book was a fluke, a figment of my imagination? Or that the author somehow found the magical formula once, but can\'t reproduce it again? Or worse, that there\'s no interesting story left to tell? But I needn\'t worry becauseIron Flamecontains all the magic of its predecessor.I will say though, going in, the length at more than 600 pages was a bit daunting. But once I started, it didn\'t even matter. I was riveted throughout. It felt like every single page served a purpose—except for the aforementioned confounding couple problems—building momentum and eventually hurtling towards a stunning conclusion. Honestly, if there were another 600 pages, I\'d happily gobble those up too.Before this book, I admit I was a bit puzzled that there could be five books in this series, like how much more is there to this story? But seeing the way Yarros has built out the universe and the war in this book, and especially that ending, I get now how there could be so much more to this. And I\'m glad. I\'m not sure I\'m ready to say goodbye to Navarre any time soon, so I\'m happy there are still a few more books to come. I just hope the wait isn\'t too long.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:#1.Fourth Wing~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""1 StarAlright, I'm not going to rant or be very specific in this review because I know many people are still currently reading the book.

I don’t understand how an author can go from writing a captivating world with a fun magic system, an incredible enemies to lovers dynamic, & well-written, fleshed out characters… to completely dismantling every aspect of that in a single book. I can not stress enough how painful this was to get through. I was tempted several times to dnf and simply pretend it doesn’t exist.the main characters in this were absolutely infuriating. they both became the worst possible versions of themselves and it made their relationship completely insufferable. they went from being one of my favorite book couples, to me not caring whether they even lived to see the end of the book.the entire story was so rushed through that I was getting whiplash. the plot of this one book could’ve been spread across the next three books. she needs to slow down the story, because rushing through the plot devalues everything.throwing in plot twists every other chapter for shock value does not make a book better, especially considering most of these plot twists were clearly not planned out. it just feels exhausting.rebecca yarros needs to seriously reevaluate her long-term plan if she wants to restore the integrity of this series (if possible at this rate). the remaining 3 books need to be properly researched, thoroughly thought out, and most importantly: NOT rushed for the sake of popularity.and it probably wouldn’t hurt to fire whoever her editor is (if said editor exists)two stars for a three star read. yes, i’m knocking an additional star off for this being my most highly anticipated read for the back half of the year, and then it having the absolute audacity to be one of the worst books i’ve ever read.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3 - ⭐️⭐️⭐️Overall,Iron Flamewas okay.Parts I\'ve enjoyed and parts I found myself skimming through the pages. It was littered with fillers.My favorite parts were mostly the action scenes and the dragon scenes.I wasn\'t a big fan of the development of the romance in this one, there were tender and hot moments but that still didn\'t make up for how the relationship seemed to go in circles rather than grow. Maybe that\'s because Xaden\'s development was.....meh? Not that Violet\'s development was any better.I absolutely loved the tension between Violet and Xaden in Fourth Wing, but once the relationship passes that phase it\'s tricky for authors to keep it interesting and it certainly fell short in this sequel.I don\'t know if I\'m the only one who feels this way but this book was heavy in dialogue and information dump and that\'s why it felt like it was dragging..The drama between some of the characters had me roll my eyes because most of it was so unnecessary we could be doing other far more interesting things than this.I\'ll just highlight a few spoilers below to get some points across so beware..............[Iron Flame Spoilers Ahead].............First of all, the jealous ex trope should be on every author\'s list of banned tropes. It always results in unnecessary drama and tension between the couple that I do not need especially when they have far more important issues they need to resolve between them. Imighttolerate it if they weren\'t an established couple, but if they are then that\'s a big no no for me.I wanted to throw my kindle at the wall. It\'s just frustrating to read about.And speaking of Violet and Xaden\'s relationship, dancing around the whole ""trust"" issue while still hiding things from each other simply because the other didn\'t bother to ""ask"" was annoying and did not add anything to their relationship but to create unnecessary tension. Did Xaden actuallyworkfor earning back Violet\'s trust or was he just waiting around for whenever the time was convenient? And Violet\'s judgement and choices were often clouded by her longing and lust for Xaden.Still I found some of their scenes tender and sexy but it definitely is less appealing to me than it was in Fourth Wing. Their relationship has less substance now.Because of how lukewarm my emotions were throughout most of the book, the ending did not gut me as much.These thoughts reflect my own experience while reading this book.'}]"

",Sarah J. Maas,4.18,3244315,613542,"Fantasy, Young Adult, Fiction, Romantasy, New Adult, Fae, Audiobook",419,05-05-2015,"When nineteen-year-old huntress Feyre kills a wolf in the woods, a terrifying creature arrives to demand retribution. Dragged to a treacherous magical land she knows about only from legends, Feyre discovers that her captor is not truly a beast, but one of the lethal, immortal faeries who once ruled her world.At least, he’s not a beast all the time.As she adapts to her new home, her feelings for the faerie, Tamlin, transform from icy hostility into a fiery passion that burns through every lie she’s been told about the beautiful, dangerous world of the Fae. But something is not right in the faerie lands. An ancient, wicked shadow is growing, and Feyre must find a way to stop it, or doom Tamlin—and his world—forever.From bestselling author Sarah J. Maas comes a seductive, breathtaking book that blends romance, adventure, and faerie lore into an unforgettable read.","[{'rating': 1, 'content': '(Note from 4/17/2023 So someone reported this for unmarked spoilers even tho I prefaced it lol so the spoilers will be marked where they are, even though they really aren\'t spoilers at all because they do not significantly affect the plot in any way but oh well. It\'s either do this or have the entire review hidden bc of spoilers)(Note from 2/21/2023 because I apparently have to spell it out: For those of you who don\'t read comments or check dates read, I read and reviewed this book in 2018. It has been about 5 years; as I have stated in a number of comments, I will not continue this series. In the intervening years since reading this, my feelings on the matter have not changed nor have I desired to continue. Please refrain from commenting about how I need to continue the series or that I did not understand the book. I receive too many of those comments and I\'m tired of replying the same thing over and over again. This review is for me first and foremost, not you. Please move on if you do not like my take.)Me to Sarah J Maas:""Do you lie awake at night to come up with all your witty replies for the following day?""Oh dear, this is awful.The WritingThe title of this book is stupid. It\'s stupid and flashy and unrelated to the actual content of the book. It\'s solely for the ~wow~ factor. The quotable line, ""I love you... Thorns and all"" is wholely ineffective because ""thorns"" had not been established as a motif and was only used in that context in that very scene, more than halfway through the book. The word ""thorn"" was only used a grand total of 9 times in this book. The original Beauty and the Beast story had established rose motifs—you can\'t borrow good writing, even for a retelling. That\'s just lazy.The writing itself was inconsistent and poorly done.I pushed and pulled, but the mud was too slick, and held fast.Are you aware of the definition of ""slick"", Sarah J Maas? I do not think it means what you think it means.Besides that, Amarantha\'s hair drastically changed color after about 90 pages:Her red-gold hairHer black hairWhich is it, Maas? It can\'t be both unless she has unmentioned magical hair dyeing abilities.The atmosphere and the opening chapter were excellent and I was intrigued by the idea that was offered me, but the actual book did not deliver at all.This next point is a spoiler, but because I am disgusted with Sarah J Maas for including this, I amnotgoing to mark it as such, since everyone should know what kind of morals this book is supporting before they read it especially when they are as filthy and vulgar as this was.The attemptedrapeof Feyre by Tamlin was brushed off as no more than a mere romantic, steamy encounter to further their lukewarm love story. The only conclusions I can logically draw from this are all rather victim blamey, tbh—she was warned several times to stay inside with the doors locked until dawn, but she leaves her room not once but twice before dawn because she ~wants to go to the party~ and then later, after she almost gets gang-raped and is saved and then creeped out by Rhysand the sociopath, she thinks she is totally safe to go eat a bunch of cookies because, well the drums stopped, so it\'s probably okay now, and then she getssexually assaultedby Tamlin, who wasstill high with lust magic.I was about to pass out when he grabbed me, so fast I didn\'t see anything until he had me pinned against the wall.""Let go,"" I said as evenly as I could.I [pushed] him away. He grabbed my hands again and bit my neck. I cried out as his teeth clamped onto the tender spot where my neck met my shoulder. I couldn\'t move—I couldn\'t think.Before, during and after theattack, she\'s thinking,Wow, he\'s really hot. I\'m kinda uncomfortable with this, but I guess it\'s okay that he\'s drunk on lust magic, because I wanted to sleep with him anyway. That is avery wrong and dangerous way of thinking.No matter what, it isneverokay foranyoneto make someone else sexually uncomfortable or afraid, especially when they\'ve given verbal disapproval. This entire scene left a bad taste in my mouth.And then there\'s Rhysand\'s behavior. He repeatedly violates her personal space and comfort, drugging her and forcing her to""dance""for him in front of a large crowd for weeks on end after stripping her all but naked. Like all Fae males, apparently, he uses brute force to get her to comply with his sexual wishes.""But he didn\'t actually touch her; he kept his hands just on her waist!"" you say. Yeah, but did she say he could touch her at all? Did she actively encourage him to touch her? No, she did not.I pulled away, but his hands were like shackles.I would not have such an issue with this if Sarah J Maas didn\'t give the impression that she supports such behavior. That is what I find unconscionable.Besides that, the plot made no sense, even after exposition-Alis gave us the lowdown—in fact, it almost madelesssense then. It was cheesy and cliché and frankly, boring. The ""riddle"" was extremely easy and only proved that Feyre is an absolute idiot with no logical abilities, as I was able to figure it out before Amarantha had even finished saying it, and I\'m notoriously bad at riddles.The sex scenes were almost Empire of Storms levels of bad, cringey, and gross. I think Sarah J Maas doesn\'t know what YA means and isn\'t aware she\'s actually writing for NA.The WorldbuildingThe Fae were, for one thing, almost exactly the same (primarily in appearance and personality) to the ones in the Throne of Glass series, and tbh I was disappointed. They\'re not even cleverly unique faeries. They\'re just Tolkien-esque elves that are actually vampires: fangs and biting, immortality, aetherial beauty, animalistic tendencies, superiority complex. They don\'t have any distinct differences from humans in their thought processes or emotional capacities—only the same degree of variety that exists in humans.The religious system and creation story was very interesting and I really liked that aspect.The CharactersFaerie aka Belle: Sarah J Maas decided to try something new and have a first-person fixed perspective, but it didn\'t really work, because Feyre was a bland complacent character without much substance passed the surface level, and most of the interesting action took place where she couldn\'t see it. She suffered, like Celaena did in Crown of Midnight, from what I call Nehemia syndrome: the character that the MC has grown to trust, despite obvious suspicious behavior, turns out to be manipulative, and yet the MC completely overlooks that fact in favor of idolization of their lying friend. In this case, everyone in Prythian is keeping secrets from her and after almost getting her questions answered by the Suriel, Feyre decides to ""Stay with the High Lord. He will keep you safe,"" and just completely forgets that she wants answers about the blight. Also, whereas Belle left the Beast in the original story because her father was in mortal danger, in this book, Feyre leaves becauseTamlin impies that she\'s gonna get ganked by Rhys or Amarantha, the evil Faerie Queen.She is not an active protagonist. Also, her painting skills aren\'t a part of her characterization; it just feels tacked on to make her ~cool~ and ~unique~Tampon aka the Beast: I don\'t even care about this guy tbh. He\'s a confusing character who just feels like a Chaol-Rowan merge on steroids. He\'s violent, obsessive, and abusive, but also sweet, understanding, and caring, because that\'s not a contradiction. There\'s a difference between a complex character and a poorly written character.Lucien aka Lumiere/Cogsworth (his steampunk eye suggests Cogsworth but his personality suggests Lumiere): So apparently he ""hates"" Feyre even though I almost shipped them more since they consistently had better chemistry than her and Tammy, and that\'s saying a lot, because they didn\'t have chemistry.exposition-Alis aka Mrs Potts: She was okay. Just okay. She was fine.Reese\'s Cups aka also the Beast and kinda Gaston too: Is he supposed to be her love interest for the rest of the series or something, because the fan art definitely suggests that, but, uh, did everyone forget that he\'s a dangeroussociopathwith a history of violence?? He has no regard for her emotional well-being and sees her body as literally nothing beyond a sexual plaything. He\'s a horrible person.Amarantha: Why did there have to be a ""big bad evil Faerie Queen"" in this at all? There\'s already one in the Throne of Glass series and I can only take so much female-against-female hate from a supposedly feminist fantasy writer. Amarantha was bland and predictable, and her motivations were extremely surface-level.Her fam: Nesta was like, supposed to have some kind of implied character arc but lol it wasn\'t very good. Elain was nice and I liked her. The dad was okay, I guess. Pretty forgettable tbhIsaac Hale aka fake-out Gaston: This character wasn\'t important at all, but I just wanted to say that I think this is the dumbest name choice in a high fantasy book that I\'ve ever seen.Isaac Hale?? Really, Sarah J Maas? Really? That\'s the Jason of fantasy names. This is a the-guy-who-went-to-high-school-with-my-older-sister kind of name. It\'s not a fantasy name.ConclusionWhile I managed to read it fairly quickly, I had to dnf it for several days before deciding to trudge through. It was horrendous. I may pick up the sequel at some point, idk, but for now, from what I predict and understand from various spoilers I\'ve encountered on the internet, I don\'t really care about this series very much. Frankly, it\'s not good.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""That was both horrible and incredible at the same time, and my thoughts are a whirlwind.Note: The first part of this review is spoiler-free, but the second half is most definitely not. The spoilery section is blocked off by siren emojis (🚨). Skip to the end for bonus content, including an ACOTAR rap written by yours truly.This is the story of a mortal girl, Feyre, who kills a Fae in the woods one day. She’s whisked away to Prythian, home of the Fae, where she will live the rest of her days as punishment for murdering the wolf.Whoever said this was a Beauty and the Beast retelling is clearly not okay. This is far from a retelling, becauseit takes all the important themes outand leaves just the bare plotline:1. The Beast (Tamlin) is not ugly or even a beast at all. He just has a mask stuck to his face forever as part of a curse that I will get into more in the spoilery section.2. We are not aware of any good reason for Tamlin to keep Feyre until the very end, and it’s still a flimsy reason (this relates back to the curse).The problem with the plot is that the foreshadowing is so faint. The plot in the beginning and up until the 75 percent mark makes no sense at all. Tamlin takes Feyre to live in luxury, with good food and nice clothes and freedom, because she killed his fellow Fae? It’s just nonsensical.How is that a punishment at all?She no longer has to care for her spoiled sisters, she’s away from the poor village.However, it does make sense in the end, but Feyre is very naive for believing all of this. Something doesn’t add up. People who DNF this book will be very confused indeed.In Beauty and the Beast, we know of the curse beforehand, so we can find a good reason for the Beast to be kind to Belle. But Tamlin? It’s a mystery.So anyway, Feyre gets taken to a land of luxury to live out the rest of her days in comfort as “punishment,” but she’s still not happy because for some reason she misses her sisters, even though they treated her like dirt.She falls in love with Tamlin, which was expected because he’s not a Beast. There’s no barrier to overcome here.She isn’t forced to look past his ugly exterior because he has no ugly exterior.Along the way, another Fae named Lucien conveniently reveals everything Feyre needs to know right before it happens. This is supposed to be foreshadowing? I think? But in the end, he makes things so easy for Feyre and there’s no conflict whatsoever.The only problems arise from Feyre’s own stupidity.Their exchanges basically go like this:Lucien: The Suriel are super dangerous and even hard for the Fae to trap so stay away.Feyre: *makes simple snare* *kills chicken* oOpS I caught one, what a coincidence!!Everything is far too easy for Feyre.She’s supposed to be a responsible hunter, but instead she makes stupid, reckless decisions that don’t line up with her character. She follows an illusion of her father despite being told it’s fake, she goes outside on Fire Night, she chases the Suriel, she goes after Tamlin… etc.If you tell her not to do something, she will do it.Lucien: Stay in your room, it’s dangerous.Tamlin: Stay in your room, it’s dangerous.Literally everyone ever: Stay in your room, it’s dangerous.Feyre: *gets a midnight snack*Feyre is trying to figure out the details of this blight that’s supposed to be taking over Prythian, but luckily for her, Lucien and Tamlin give everything away with no struggle whatsoever.The result is thatthe danger does not feel genuine.It feels like a cheesy way to add angst to the relationship between Feyre and Tamlin.Speaking of Tamlin, everyone hates him so much but he’s such a sweetheart. I know that he gets worse in ACOMAF, but there’s nothing wrong with him in this book. He may be a little bland, but he’s much better than Rhysand. More details in the spoilery section.And then we have the writing, which is just bad. “...” is used in every other sentence, the poor em dashes are abused, and Feyre’s bones bark. A lot. Like, every time she falls down, she describes her barking bones. And what’s up with the phrase “my bowels turned watery?” It’s used at least twice and I don’t like it at all. This is notShatter Me.🚨🚨🚨SPOILER ALERT🚨🚨🚨So, what’s up with Amarantha?I really do like her. She’s a compelling villain because she’s (somewhat) realistic. Sure, she tortures people for fun, but her backstory makes this seem (somewhat) reasonable. (Somewhat.)Basically, she kidnaps Tamlin and Feyre runs after them because she has no self-preservation instinct. She challenges Amarantha, and in return, she is given three trials. If she wins them all, she and Tamlin will be free and his powers will return. If she loses… well, Amarantha keeps saying that there wouldn’t be enough left of Feyre to burn.However, Amarantha gives her a different option. She could solve a riddle.This is when things go downhill. First of all, why would Amarantha bet all her power and might on a simple riddle? It’s not even that hard to solve. The riddle itself is bad. The rhyming pattern isn’t great. And worst of all, the answer?It’s love.The answer is love.How does this make sense? Amarantha is a brutal, sadistic villain, so why would she write such a cliche, cheesy riddle?She should have made it oddly specific so Feyre would never get it.Anyway, Feyre answers it correctly at the last minute, Amarantha loses all her power, and Tamlin kills her.It was far too easy.Moving onto Rhysand. I hate him with a burning passion. He’s a greasy, crusty, dusty, musty old man. I can’t believe Feysand is the endgame ship. I’m suing. This is ridiculous. I don’t understand how people love him. He’s abusive, uncomfy, and weird.People keep telling me that I will love Rhysand in ACOMAF and hate Tamlin. First of all, I highly doubt it.Second of all,if you have to rely on making one character a villain just to get people to like the other character, that’s bad writing.Finally, the curse is so specific and random. Tamlin has to fall in love with a mortal girl who hates the Fae so much that she killed one in cold blood, and he has to wear a mask, and she can't know it's a curse.🚨🚨🚨END OF SPOILERS🚨🚨🚨In conclusion: Feyre is an idiot, Tamlin is precious, and Rhysand deserves to rot in a hole.Also, I wrote a rap.

DNF at 30% because I just got fed up with things moving at a snail\'s pace and NOT MAKING SENSE AT ALL. This was one of the most uncompelling versions ofBeauty and the Beastthat I have ever read. The writing is nothing outstanding, there was nothing that moved me. I feltCruel Beautyamong other B&B retellings I\'ve read this year and last have done a far superior job at moving me emotionally.Look, I\'m sure by the end of the book, all the things tie together and everything\'s just dandy and things will make sense, and I\'d be like ""ooooooh, so that\'s why ____."" Me, I don\'t care. Ain\'t nobody got time for that. I have so many questions and I\'m just fed up. This is not a retelling of Beauty and the Beast. This is a book about a girl who gets to live an easy life with a guy who\'s implied to be a gorgeous Fae underneath his mask.The original story makes sense: here\'s roughly how it goes. Handsome prince is cursed to be ugly unless he gets a chick to fall for him. Flash forward, there\'s Belle\'s dad. Belle\'s dad wanders into Beast\'s castle and touches his stuff. Beast doesn\'t like the fact that Belle\'s dad touched his stuff. Beast is going to kill Belle\'s dad unless he gets Beast some pussy. Belle\'s valiantly steps in to save dad, Beast is as nice to her as much as a hairy ugly, self-conscious, socially ostracized monster can be. Belle is treated like a princess because Beast really, really fucking needs her to save him and his people before the curse runs out!There\'s a reason Belle is treated like the queen! Things make sense! They have to learn to trust one another. Things are slowly developed an built over time. There is a hideous beast who is scarred emotionally, and a beauty who needs to look past the exterior. There is a point. Not so with this book.Things are far, far too easy with this book.Now here\'s this version of Beauty and the Beast,a retelling that tries to be bad-ass and fails completely,from the little that I have read.There\'sFeyrewho has a pretty crappy life with an absentminded, worthless, spineless dad, and two of the most bitchy, ungrateful sisters in the entire world. She slaves for them, she hunts food for them, she works her ass off for them. Without her, their family would starve. They don\'t care. I feel some pity for her, but she acts like so much of a martyr that there\'s only so much I can take.While hunting one day, Feyre kills a wolf, well, surprise, surprise, that wolf turns out to be a Fae in disguise. In return for this kill, Feyre is taken by a wolf (who\'s a Fae in disguise) away from her family.“What is the payment the Treaty requires?”His eyes didn’t leave my face as he said, “A life for a life. Any unprovoked attacks on faerie-kind by humans are to be paid only by a human life in exchange.”A life for a life!Oh, no! Is she going to die?! That\'s what a life for a life means, right?WRONG. Feyre is taken off to magical Fairyland to live in luxury for the rest of her life while her family is taken care of back in their little village.“Some would say it’s unwise to insult a Fae in his home,” Tamlin ground out. “Some would say you should be grateful for me finding you before another one of my kind came to claim the debt, for sparing your life and then offering you the chance to live in comfort.”So what?!Why?!This makes no sense at all.Feyre kills one of their kind. A beloved brother.In exchange, there isabsolutely no punishment whatsoever. She gets to live in a fantastically fabulous castle, waited on by servants. She gets beautiful clothes and delicious food.Another useless answer. I dug into my breakfast, savoring each rich sip of tea, and she slipped into the bathing chamber. When I was done eating and bathing, I refused Alis’s offer and dressed myself in another exquisite tunic—this one of purple so deep it could have been black.Clearly there is some kind of a setup involving The Treaty, since there seems to be a lot of secrecy between the Fae...but wait, whatever information she wants, the Fae reveals...they\'re revealing their own weakness to Feyre, who is constantly plotting her own escape.It doesn\'t make any sense!“There is … a sickness in these lands. Across Prythian. There has been for almost fifty years now. It is why this house and these lands are so empty: most have left. The blight spreads slowly, but it has made magic act … strangely. My own powers are diminished due to it. These masks”—he tapped on his—“are the result of a surge of it that occurred during a masquerade forty-nine years ago. Even now, we can’t remove them.”Over and over and over,the Fae reveal their secrets to her, including one that might help her escape.“So there are faeries who will actually answer any question if you trap them?” Maybe they’d know how to free me from the Treaty’s terms.“Yes,” he said tightly. “The Suriel. But they’re old and wicked, and not worth the danger of going out to find them.And then pretty much the next chapter, she goes out AND IMMEDIATELY FINDS THESE MYSTERIOUS CREATURES. WHAT THE FUCK.I do not like it when things come so easily to a main character, and everything comes easily to Feyre. There is no consequence whatsoever to her actions. There is no punishment to her deed of killing. The Fae are supposed to hate her...it doesn\'t feel like it, because she is ""inconsequential."" In fact, they\'re more of her playmates than her wardens. The Fae seem to have no other things to do besides play with her and hunt with her.“My morning work was postponed,” he said. Indeed, his usual tunic was off, the baldric gone, and the sleeves of his white shirt had been rolled up to the elbows to reveal tanned forearms corded with muscle. “If you want a ride across the grounds—if you’re interested in your new … residence, I can take you.”And teach her how to read and write...because Feyre cannot read or write, an ironic twist to the Disney Belle\'s love for reading.“I could help you write to them, if that’s why you’re in here.”Feyre is irreverent, ungrateful and insulting to her wardens...in a way that gets her no punishment whatsoever.“Do you ever stop being such a prick?” I snapped back.Dead—really, truly, I should have been dead for that.But Lucien grinned at me. “Much better.”As I said, I\'m sure this book improves in the end, but from what I\'ve read, this book makes no sense, the writing is emotionless, the characters are flat, the main character unrealistic, and I do not care to continue.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""INITIAL REACTION: WILL UPDATE WITH REVIEW LATER BUT KNOW I LOVED THIS.

I started reading it as soon as it became available and the array of positive reviews from my friends and strangers alike made me feel sure I would love it. But I didn\'t. It is possible I expected all the wrong things fromA Court of Thorns and Roses, and maybe my review can prevent others from doing the same.Here\'s what I expected:an intricate fantasy world, supernatural politics and alliances, fast-paced action, a sensual romance - perhaps similar toCruel Beautyand otherBeauty and the Beastretellings, and a flawed but likable heroine.But this book is, if you ask me, nothing more or less thansoftcore erotica. Which is fine, if that\'s what you\'re looking for.I personally thought that the fantasy aspect felt like trimmings around a story that was all about a romance between Feyre (the narrator) and Tamlin (a High Lord of the Fae). There are some titillating scenes where Tamlin bites Feyre\'s neck and they have sex - undoubtedly the best bits of the book and I won\'t pretend I didn\'t feel a little hot under the collar myself. But the ""ancient wicked shadow"" promised in the blurb is only really a source of more romantic angst for Feyre and Tamlin.However, I *do* like a good romance as much as anyone, so there are other reasons this book didn\'t quite work for me. In order to express what I mean, I\'m going to compareA Court of Thorns and RosestoCruel Beauty, which is, in my opinion, a better book.In CB, I felt the chemistry between Nyx and Ignifex as soon as their loaded banter started to fill the pages. They were sexy together, Ignifex was an evil ruler (which was a real problem for their relationship) with blood-red eyes, and the supernatural part of the book was creepy, weird and completely unique. Despite enjoying the actual non-PG scenes inA Court of Thorns and Roses, I never felt any real chemistry between Feyre and Tamlin or any realistic challenge to their relationship.What makesBeauty and the Beastsuch a compelling romance?One that demands to be told over and over again in so many different ways? I\'ll tell you what it is: it\'s the obstacles, the challenges, the improbability...how can a young woman come to love an ugly beast?We ask.I\'ll prove it\'s possible!The author replies. That\'s why readers fall in love with the beast again and again, even when he is furry and has horns like the Disney version. I loved the Disney beast.And that badass fox in Robin Hood so it\'s possible I have issues.Tamlin is not a beast.“Even as he bit out the words, I couldn’t ignore the sheer male beauty of that strong jaw, the richness of his golden-tan skin.”Oh my, how could a poor young woman ever love a pretty-faced, golden-haired, completely not evil Fae prince? How weird.Maas is a good writer and the beginning - before Feyre is taken to the Fae world - made me believe a great book was on the way. When Maas writes action, she writes actionreallywell. But there was far too little of it in this book. It came in behind the descriptions of beautiful Fae men and the Fae palace.In short:It just wasn\'t nasty enough.In truth, this felt more like an extended Cinderella retelling than what it was supposed to be. A girl lives in poverty and looks after her rather annoying sisters until one day she is swept up by a prince who takes her to his beautiful palace (after about three chapters). I just find it hard to recommend this when I thinkCruel Beautyis similar and yet so much better.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Tumblr'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""4.45/5 ⭐Full review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolf🐺This book’s mood song match –Fix You by Coldplaymum: *enters kitchen at 3 am* What the hell are you doing?me: *with a bowl of ice cream in one hand and ACOTAR in the other* I'm starting another SJM seriesmum: Hang on, I have a bottle of vodka here somewhere*And if this is not some relatable shit when facing Sarah J. Maas’s books then I don’t know what to tell you anymore. You puzzle me.So, there you go – another great universe erected by SJM just in front of our humble eyes. She is building her own fucking multiverse and we are here to witness the power of a goddess at work. I will make three sacrifices for that.This is, so far, for me, the best Beauty and the Beast reimagination.HER EXECUTION STYLE IS THE AIR TO MY LUNGS.And this one is not even the best of her works.“Magic – everything was magic, and it broke my heart.”Mainly, our action is happening at the Spring Court where our main character finds herself in front of a new intriguing life. Or at least as intriguing as a Court of flowery gardens can be.As I always say about SJM’s books,the characters are the ones who make the action. It’s like they are the very engine of a plot.I kind of likeFeyre. She definitely has her own personal issues, mainly because she is broken and lonely and desperate to beat her status. She is human and miserable, mainly because her family is horrible. Her whole family was created to look like the typical fairytale family – an absent coward of a father, an uninterested mother, a sister full of wicked hatred and another one caught up in her own world, sensitive and naïve. Until her sisters do something worthy of my affection, I ain’t changing my mind about them.Lucien(the Emissary of the Spring Court), I must say, I liked from the very beginning, but he somehow managed to grow on me. There was something likeable about him at first and he only proved that to me more as the action went on.Tamlin, the High Lord of the Spring Court, on the other hand, seemed a bit stiff the whole book, even though I sometimes appreciated the occasional softness of his heart.But full-on honesty now – thebestthing about this book, the one thing that made it 110% better wasRhysand. He won for this book a full star from me with all of his domineering prick moves. He played the bad boy role so good that my traitorous heart enjoyed him whole. I might have a problem but oh, what a perfect problem he is.“His voice was a lover’s purr that sent shivers through me, caressing every muscle and bone and nerve.”Sexy.Rhysand and Feyre certainly have a sort of total chemistry that it seems Feyre doesn’t have with Tamlin; not even after theysupposedlyfell in love with each other. I don’t buy that love for more than a second and by the end when everything seemed to try to make me believe their relationship I was still not convinced.I recognise fabulous chemistry when I see one and that ain’t it. Rhysand, you’d better act up, love, I have expectations. You’re more than just a cruel, beautiful ruffian, I know it.There’s a certain cruelty in this book, so very Maas. I sometimes feel like I’m reading the words of a psychopath, but then I remind myself how much Ienjoythis cruelty in these books and I temperate myself.That crazy wretch Amarantha is definitely the embodiment of cold murder and torture in this book and this is visible when it comes to how much her actions affect the other characters’ moods and movements. It’s terribly interesting though to see how terrified all of them can become when facing her.But by the end, there was this sliver of hope that lingered. And that broke the evil to pieces.“This wasn’t music to dance to – it was music to worship, music to feel in the gaps of my soul, to bring me to a place where there was no pain.”Even though I think this is not the best of SJM’s works, I still believe is so very good that just makes you want to know more. It leaves you craving. And in my humble opinion, that’s a bonus factor in books.All and all, my first step into the ACOTAR universe has been a success. More steps to come. Until I fall in love. Wholly and irrevocably.""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I cannot remember ever being this conflicted over a book. There are parts of A Court of Thorns and Roses I really loved, but a lot of parts I really hated.I went into this book fully expecting to love it. Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite fairy tales, and I was interested to see how SJM made the story her own.First off, my biggest problem with this story was Feyre as a character. I have never been so irritated. Her character development and personality, for the most part, didn\'t make sense to me. She was the caretaker of her entire family for years, supposedly a hunter with a strong survival instinct. And yet, she proceeded to make the stupidest decisions and put herself in danger time and time again. I didn\'t get the sense that she did this out of bravery, but more out of stupidity. It didn\'t mesh with what her character was supposed to be. Examples of these idiotic choices:1. Repeatedly plotting to escape into a faerie land that she knew to be deadly, when she was asleep on the way to the manor and obviously wouldn\'t know her way back to the mortal lands2. Running after the illusion of her CRIPPLED father at NIGHT, when she has been told and witnessed how deceptive fae can be3. Trapping a Suriel with little more than a snare, in the deadly part of the forest, after she has been told, and AGAIN, SEEN how dangerous these creatures are4. Going to Fire Night after being told how dangerous it is, not leaving after being almost raped by 3 faeries, and then proceeding to leave her room AGAIN afterwards5. Drinking the faerie wine at the Solstice, even after Lucien of all people warned her not to6. Leaving the manor when the Suriel flat out TOLD her not to and that she would be safe with Tamlin, and deciding to not mention that to ANYONE before he forced her to leaveIn addition to all of these idiotic choices, she also is incredibly inconsistent. She\'ll go from hating Fae to sympathizing with them to loving them back to fearing them at the drop of a hat. These inconsistencies are probably the most irritating, as there are scenes that I absolutely adore with Feyre, but then she goes back to doing the next pain in the ass thing on the next page.I also found her relationship with Tamlin to be problematic. Yes, I do enjoy problematic things (especially ships from time to time) but there were a lot of things I couldn\'t excuse with them. Again, more inconsistencies in characters\' behavior. Tamlin\'s hot and cold behavior was eventually explained, but not until 70% of the way through the book. It was too little too late. Also,I found the Fire Night scene to be a problem for me. I do enjoy volatile relationships and bad boy characters. But only when we are told from the beginning that one of the characters is ""bad"". Tamlin we are led to believe is a saint, then he bites her and gets possessive, but all is forgiven the next morning. Because he\'s a ""nice guy."" No.The world building I found to be lackluster in a lot of ways. While I really enjoyed the wide variety of Fae creatures we got to see, I thought that a lot of the back story was revealed in a lazy way. Instead of having Feyre figure anything out for herself, important things are told to her through long monologues from a number of characters throughout the book. This happens numerous times.Additionally, few side characters have any development and most felt like blank slates. With that being said, the ones that were developed I adored. Lucien and Rhys saved the book for me in a lot of ways. I found them both to be complex and interesting characters.The last 10-15% of the book saved it for me. I found the plot to finally be interesting, and I found Feyre\'s decisions in those chapters to actually make sense. A lot of things were set up for future books that have me very intrigued, and I\'m looking forward to the rest of the series. Many things that I disliked in this book, may in fact be remedied due to some of the occurrences in this last small section of the book.Overall, I was disappointed by this first installment. While there were elements I really enjoyed, they didn\'t make up for the elements I didn\'t. I\'m hoping future installments will prove to be better.I will also be doing a full video review and spoiler-filled discussion on mychannelin the future if you want to know more of my thoughts.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""If you've ever wondered which literary world would be the best to live in, wonder no longer, cause there's aBookTube Videoto answer that!The Written Review:----------Update - 12/6/19ShouldI cross the insurmountable TBR? Or reread this series again?I think you know the answer----------Here's the original review:Feyre is huntingin the middle of the woods tokeep her useless starving family alive(Hunger Games, anyone?).A chance encounter with a wolf - who wasn't entirely a wolf - leaves Feyreon the wrong end of an ancient treaty.She is forced to go to the fairy realm to live out the remaining years of her human life -no friends, no family and no freedom.“Has anyone ever taken care of you?” he asked quietly.“No.” I’d long since stopped feeling sorry for myself about it.At first, she cannot think of anything but escape. Slowly (but surely), she is swept into the fairy realm -in its magic & intrigue, in its danger & hopelessness, and in its wonder & glory.“Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, Dawn, Day, and Night,” it mused, as if I hadn’t even answered. “The seven Courts of Prythian, each ruled by a High Lord, all of them deadly in their own way. They are not merely powerful—they are Power.”Feyre lands in the Spring court - which is under amasquerade cursefor nearly fifty years.The court is being attacked by all manner of terrible creatures and there is ablight upon the land.This blight will soon cross to the human realm - threatening everyone Feyre holds dear.The first half sucksbut keep readingThere's no way around it. From page 1 to about 200, Feyre isannoying and obstinate.I nearly put this book down half a dozen times (it was like readingRed Queen).BUT, there was something about it that kept me interested.AND THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT.Because wow. Seriously wow.Midway through the book,things turned around magnificently.It was like a whole new book.Sarah J Maas is a devious little thing.Suddenly, all the plot holes, nonsensical actions of her fairy captors (Tamlin and Lucien) and Feyre's complete idiocy flipped on their heads.Everything makes sense now.I literally could not put this down.Though, and maybe it's just me, butthe Tamlin-Feyre arc felt a bit rushed/forced.Her constant love declarations really had me questioning their relationship. But then again, I had a friend who accidentally spilled the beans on that one.Without giving any spoilers, I sure hope book 2 does acomplete character shifton you-know-who (NOT voldemort) because I amnot pleasedwith the way the love interest was hinted at during the end of the book. (He's such a jerk!)Overall, I amamazedby how much effort Sarah J. Maas put into constructing this story. I'm this close || to rereading the book solely to better appreciate all those little clues that I must have passed over.So, if you pick this up and just aren't feeling it -keep reading- trust me.The Finer Books Club - 2018 Reading Challenge: A book recommended by a friendYouTube|Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Facebook| Snapchat @miranda_reads""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""4.8/5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️“Don't feel bad for one moment about doing what brings you joy.”I'm speechless.

I WANT THE SECOND BOOK IN MY HANDS BUT MY ORDER STILL HASN'T COME. I'M READY TO GO TO FUCKING ENGLAND MYSELF AND PURCHASE IT. KIDS I'M LITERALLY DYING HERE.The Beauty and the Beast-esque fantasy drama tells the story of Feyre, who finds herself entwined with faeries after unknowingly killing one. When the 19-year-old huntress kills a wolf in the woods, a beast-like creature arrives to demand retribution for it. Dragged to a treacherous magical land she only knows about from legends, Feyre discovers that her captor is not an animal, but Tamlin, one of the lethal, immortal faeries who once ruled their world. Feyre must find a way to stop it or doom Tamlin and his world forever.I'm not a fantasy fan. I love fantasy in film and tv but not in books. I picked up this book cause I wanted to use it for my thesis for uni (don't even ask) and now after I graduated I decided to give it a go. My favorite genres to read are historical fiction and contemporary, and fantasy falls on a very different category. But the fantasy in this book man... it gripped me tight and didn't let me go.First I started off this book a bit confused. The language confused me a bit, the terms, all the information. I'm reading books in English while my native language is Greek so fantasy fell a bit harsh on me. As I said, I'm not a fantasy fan, and with fantasy comes many weird words and shit like that. But I kept going and after a while I got used to everything and started to enjoy the plot and the characters. I enjoyed very much the factor that there weren't many characters in this book. I don't like when a book is crowded with characters, it doesn't give me the space to love them all. This book succeeded in making all the characters lovable for me... even Rhysand. I fucking love Rhysand man. Unexpected feelings happening.The worldSarah J. Maascreated is so rich and dark and gloomy but also happy and hopeful and full of light, I truly enjoyed reading about it. I always get bored, to be honest, with descriptions and politics of different worlds but this one excited me. Even the fucking politics were exciting. I want to delve more into this world wHEN MY FUCKING BOOK ARRIVES.Now to the juicy shit... the romance. Holy fucking shit. I ship these two so hard I can't even breathe. When he sent her away I wanted to scream! He gave her a good fucking and left her hanging. Why am I laughing at this? But honestly, the romance was amazing. At first, I felt like the entire book was only gonna be about the romance and I didn't quite enjoy that but after all the revelations and the twists in the plot, the romance was used wisely. And I didn't expect that, because I have heard lots of things about this book. And now we have Rhysand... this dark, handsome motherfucker who has a gloomy past. This will become a triangle, I can feel it in my bones. But I'm here for it, for some reason. I love the heat Maas's romances convey in me.To sum it all up, this book took me a while to get into but it was all worth it. Maybe after this book I will start reading more fantasy. Maybe. Maybe not. As I'm waiting for the sequel to arrive, I will drawn my sorrow into crying about how amazing this first book was. Or maybe reread some parts. Maybe.

And I have faith in ya\'ll.Plus, I am getting it free from the library, so why not, no?'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""I approached this book with an open mind and wanted to enjoy it. Despite not being a fan of the superfluous writing style or the lackluster world-building, I was still willing to rate it 3 stars by viewing it as an easy guilty pleasure romance book. The relationship seems harmless and I still don't see how it's as problematic as people dramatize it to be. The first half of the book is a standard Beauty and the Beast retelling — not awful, but not special either — and then the second half really dips in quality, which lowered my rating to 2 stars.A couple glaring issues that stood out to me:1) The background story of the curse is literally told instead of shown via a side character's lengthy monologue. This was disappointing since I was intrigued to find this out by piecing clues together, not by being told it straightforwardly like a regurgitated wikipedia article.2) The main character seems relatively smart but consistently has leaps of logic that are clearly there for the sake of plot. 9 out of 10 times she won't follow the advice of another character.3) The antagonist is SO cartoonish — like mustache-twirling cartoonish. She gives a bunch of arbitrary challenges and rules for no reason other than for the sake of stringing along a story. It feels like she's hosting a game show or some overly complex scavenger hunt. There's no reason why she'd bother setting up any of these superfluous rules. I think this is the worst antagonist I've ever read.I'm willing to overlook the writing style and bland romance, but once I got to the part where Feyre answers the riddle, I had to drop it down to 2 stars because it was so ridiculous and lazy. I've heard that the sequel is much better though, so I am willing to give it another try, just not any time soon haha.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'First read: May 2015Second read: May 2016Third read: April 2017Fourth read: February 2018Fifth read: June 2019 — I think this is my most read series alongside Harry Potter and Mistborn.Sixth reread: Feb 2021Seventh reread: September 2023Every reread of this book has somewhat differed but nothing too drastic. It’s still my least favourite in the series. There’s nostalgia involved since this was my first book by Sarah J Maas. I’ve become really familiar with these books now. Or maybe I should say attached.It’s a great Beauty and the Beast retelling. It’s a great setup for the books to come, especially where Feyre is concerned and her character development, which is where Maas excels at.I quite frankly hated how loyal Feyre was to her family, though it’s understandable. But it’s this level of loyalty without any concern for her own well-being that leads to her downfall. Her loyalty to Tamlin when it came to the events that happen towards the end of the book destroy her. It was uncomfortable to read and see Feyre come to this realisation herself.This seems to straddle the line of YA and NA fantasy, which is why I’m assuming the world-building feels so lacklustre, and at times, juvenile. Amarantha read like a spoiled child, though she’s the villain. I just didn’t care for the magic and world-building in this book because of how underdeveloped they felt.Thank the stars this improves leaps and bounds in the sequels. Everything improves drastically in the sequels.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'An illiterate 19 year old straight up kills a guy and is outraged when there are consequences.

Funny Story
",Emily Henry,4.24,734665,552023,"Romance, Fiction, Audiobook, Contemporary, Contemporary Romance, Adult, Chick Lit",400,23-04-2024,"A shimmering, joyful new novel about a pair of opposites with the wrong thing in common, from #1New York Timesbestselling author Emily Henry.Daphne always loved the way her fiancé, Peter, told their story. How they met (on a blustery day), fell in love (over an errant hat), and moved back to his lakeside hometown to begin their life together. He really was good at telling it... right up until the moment he realized he was actually in love with his childhood best friend Petra.Which is how Daphne begins her new story: stranded in beautiful Waning Bay, Michigan, without friends or family but with a dream job as a children’s librarian (that barely pays the bills), and proposing to be roommates with the only person who could possibly understand her predicament: Petra’s ex, Miles Nowak.Scruffy and chaotic—with a penchant for taking solace in the sounds of heart break love ballads—Miles is exactly the opposite of practical, buttoned-up Daphne, whose coworkers know so little about her they have a running bet that she’s either FBI or in witness protection. The roommates mainly avoid one another, until one day, while drowning their sorrows, they form a tenuous friendship and a plan. If said plan also involves posting deliberately misleading photos of their summer adventures together, well, who could blame them?But it’s all just for show, of course, because there’s no way Daphne would actually start her new chapter by falling in love with her ex-fiancé’s new fiancée’s ex... right?","[{'rating': 5, 'content': '4.75!“All those moments throughout the days, weeks, months that don\'t get marked on calendars with hand-drawn stars or little stickers.Those are the moments that make a life.Not grand gestures, but mundane details that, over time, accumulate until you have a home, instead of a house.The things that matter.The things I can\'t stop longing for.”Now I am not gonna lie but this was not Emily\'s best work and after a rant withRoxyI understand that there can be some things that could have been done to make the story better but that does not change the fact that I loved reading this book and did not want it to end because you just have to read Emily Henry\'s works to understand that! Good writing is such a plus for me because if the writing isengaging and has you fully immersedin the book you probably won\'t see the problems that it has, unless its pin pointed out and this was the case with this book because I was so in love with the writing and the characters and with everything that she set up that I did not even find anything bothering me. She writes such intricate characters who you can relate with so much and you actually do feel for them, overlapped with such realistic qualities and problems that makes you relate to them and that doesn\'t make you feel alone because you see how another character faces the same problems, deals with it the same way you do and there\' just something so beautiful about it.Okay so it\'s basically about two two people Daphna and Miles both their Fiancées cheat on them which leads to Daphne getting kicked out of Peters house and has to stay with Miles and while they both are there, the get a wedding invitation from their exes which leads to Miles and Daphne falling into a fake relationship to make them jealous and honestly them being roommates as well was so hot. It was different from other fake dating tropes because of the way it was set but the way it unraveled could have been something more. There\'s this quote during this scene where Daphne tells Miles of what she did that I laughed at and smiled stupidly at:""Wait!\' He braces his hands against the counter, face brightening. ""So he called to try to make you feel so pathetic you wouldn\'t come ruin his special day and you told him we were dating?\'\'Im sorry,\' I say again.\'That fucking rules,\' He says. \'How\'d he take it?""Daphne and Miles were such good characters and I kind of think that there could have been more depth to them but I still enjoyed the way that they were written in like Daphne self doubting herself because of her father always left her after promising that he was there to stay and I loved how she got over it and finally confessed her feeling by giving an angry rant on his phone because he needed that and I also appreciated the bond that she had with her mother although I do think that we could have gotten more one on one scenes for them and as for Miles, I loved him so much and its with all Emily Henry\'s men, I see myself in them.. be it Gus, Wyn, Charlie, Alex or Miles theres always something within them that I find I can relate too and for here with Miles was how he texts, the way he overuses the word nice which bugRoxyoff so much but for me the thing that I related to him the most was whereHe panicked and reacted anxiously and then realized what he had done a little too lateI won\'t elaborate on that because that would be a spoiler but I did get him during that scene but besides that scene, Miles was such a cute and hot too?? loved him. There was one thing that I appreciated as well but thought more could have been done was Miles past with her mother and how it turned him into who he was, always overlooking peoples negative side, never lashing out and always being nice(?)Their banter that I loved:""True,\' he says \'but I haven\'t had any luck yet tracking down the stretch of beach where thirtysomethings go to smoke weed\'\'Oh, they\'re all just vaping from their beds while watching HGTV\'\'Not us,\' he says\'No, we\'re adventurous\' I say""_""I turn to look at him. \'Even when you try to be mean, you\'re nice,\'His eyes seem to spark when he smiles. \'I\'ll try harder.""_""Do me a favor,\' he says lightly, \'Unlock your door.\'\'Why?\'\'So I can push you out as I peel out of the parking lot,\' he says,\'You would never,\' I say\'I would never\' he admits.""_“Drink. Dance. Have fun.”“In a room with our exes,” I point out. “Who think we’re dating.”Miles’s smile hitches up. “See?” he says. “Doesn’t that sound fun?”I absolutely loved the friendship that Ashleigh and Daphne had because it was so down to earth and real and raw that I just fell in love with it and I think it was because Emily focused on Ashleighs character as well and gave her a story which made us understand where she was coming from and what was happening and how that eventually led them to be friends and I also loved how she supported Daphne\'s decisions but wont lie to her as well and would subtly try to make her understand things, she was certainly better than whatever the fuck Sadie was. Another bond that I liked but thought some scenes could have been explored more was of Miles and his sister JUlie they were just so wholesome and cute and deserve the whole world.""You\'re worth it, Daphne,"" he says, hand soft on my jaw and eyes closed.\'Miles?\' I whisper. \'I do, I do what all those parts of you\'His eyes open, molten, warm, \'Good,\' He says. \'They want you too.\'Then he kisses me.""The romance was honestly the horniest Emily has ever been it was not I would say insta-lust because there was development and it wasn\'t like \' oh one look and im hard\' but it was that instead of the intense pining, proximity and slow burn, they just acted on what they felt. I am a sucker for slow burn and wanted more but I cant deny how much I enjoyed reading the scenes. Also, the way emily henry also writes poetic smut?? Like??? How can you do that woman. Despite it being her horniest, it was very well balanced.Now,The things that could have been better;(spoilers)(credits;roxy)1, More drama as we were promised a wedding which could have increased the sexual tension, the fake dating part and the drama a lot.2, Daphne going to her mom to rant like we saw Rory do with Lorelai in Gilmore Girls.3, Male povs because having Miles\'s POV would have been so interesting since would\'ve gotten his emotional scene with Julie and it wouldve been more showing and less telling.4, More drama by Miles\'s mother meeting them and this book being at least 200 pages moreNowthe scenes that I loved1, When Daphne gets dumped and throws almonds at Petra and Peter2, Miles and Daphne hanging out across the town3, The cherry hill scene with Ashleigh, Miles and Daphne4, Daphne making it up to Ashleigh5, Miles going to confront Daphne\'s dad6, The cute tender moments between Miles and Daphne that will make you feel single.7, the milkshake, fries and beach scene.Overall, a fantastic read that I will definitely read again and again despite some things that could have been added.Ratings for her other books:1, Beach read: 52, Happy place: 53, Funny story: 4.754, People we meet on vacation: 4.55, Book lovers: 4.02Special shoutout toRoxyfor getting me to read all of Emily\'s books last year and hearing my rants about it.

This is my first Emily Henry book that turned out being such a letdown for me, as I was a big fan of the rest of her stories, or at least most of them. I\'m still not entirely sure if the title was meant to refer to the way our two main characters, Miles and Daphne, began their relationship — ""You know, Funny Story.. my fiancé dumped me for his childhood best friend, who happened to be Miles’s girlfriend, and that’s how we ended up living together, and then I accidentally told my ex-fiancé that Miles and I are dating, so now we are fake dating."", or if it was just meant to suggest that this would be a fun story to read. Maybe it even refers to both of these options at the same time — which is most likely, but unfortunately, as I already said, it didn\'t end up to be a fun read for me.As usual, as in every Emily Henry book, we have a book-loving character, this time a librarian — Daphne, who turned out to be quite an okay heroine for me. I could relate to her in a few ways and if I had to choose which main character I liked more, I would point at her, but at the same time, she wasn\'t even close to the bond I had with January, who I\'m starting to think will always be my favorite heroine of this author. I probably would have felt more than just ""quite okay"" about her if she hadn\'t moaned every time she ate something, but like I said, she wasn\'t that bad. I actually loved that she stood her ground and never considered going back to her cheating ex-fiancé, unlike our hero who wasn\'t so sure about it and who, speaking of which — let\'s get to him now.Miles Nowak, our Bridget Jones\'s Diary-watching, spicy-woodsy-smelling (like every other romance book hero), Crocs-loving hero who as for now is my least favorite Emily Henry male character. Yes, he had some good moments, but instead of screaming, blushing, and kicking my feet for how wonderful he was with Daphne, I kept thinking about these facts about him""Miles looks up at me.“They,” I say, “suck.”“She’s the love of my life,” he says.“The love of your life sucks,” I tell him.""The love of your life? Hell no. I didn\'t like that he said that about his cheating ex-girlfriend, so I expected him to say the same thing about the heroine later in the book, but that didn\'t happen. I know he loved Daphne and chose her, but this quote left a bitter taste in my mouth.Or when the question was asked ""if they would get back together with their exes"" and Daphne\'s answer was this""Would he take her back? I find myself wondering, before seamlessly transitioning into Would I take Peter back?“Definitely not,”I say aloud.""and Miles’s that""Petra was the exception, not the rule, for me. So if she wanted to get back together?I don’t know.But it’s not worth thinking about, since she’s engaged to your ex-boyfriend.”She cheated on you with her best friend?!? What do you mean ""I don’t know.""?? It should have been ""No."" from the very beginning when you found out about it.The worst moment in the book that confirmed me why he is my least favorite Emily Henry hero was when he went to see his ex when she called him crying and because of that he left Daphne waiting for him.""And then Petra called, and she was sobbing. So hard I couldn’t understand her. I’d never seen her cry before. I honestly thought someone had died. She asked if I could come see her, and I said yes. Because I was worried.I still care about her.”Shecheated on youand then a month later was engaged to her best friend!?! What do mean you still care about her??""I didn’t mean to tell her first.” The tops of his cheeks redden. “That I’m in love with you.""And then the first person to know he loved Daphne was also his ex. You know that feeling when you read a romance novel and you just feel that the hero loves the heroine? In Miles\' case it was the opposite. Throughout the book, I had the impression that if his ex-girlfriend wanted to come back to him, he would welcome her with open arms. Only at the end of the book, when he did one thing, I was like ""Hmm, okay, maybe he loves Daphne then."". But as I just said, I only started feeling it at the end of the book. All the things I mentioned, plus the fact that a month after the breakup he still kept pictures of her in his room instead of burning them, are why he will probably always be my least favorite Emily character.I don\'t even know what to say about the romance part of the book because it was boring as the chemistry between Daphne and Miles seemed non-existent to me. They finally confessed their love to each other, and the only thing I felt was happiness, because I knew that this book would end soon. I guess that alone says enough how much I enjoyed their love story.I never expected that reading Emily Henry\'s book would evoke so many unpleasant emotions in me, and yet, as you can see, it unfortunately happened. I hope I\'m in the minority of people who feel this way, because Emily\'s book being one of the biggest disappointments of the year wasn’t on my bingo card.────────Me at my graduation: 😐Me at my wedding: 😐Me when Emily Henry announces a new book: 😍😍😩😩😻😻😻😍🥰🥰😍🥰'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I give this book 4.5 stars, rounded up to steamy forced proximity, friends to lovers, opposites attraction. In no way can I give any Emily Henry book less than five stars.This book isn\'t my favorite among Emily Henry\'s works. ""Happy Place"" holds that position, while ""People We Meet on Vacation"" is my least favorite of hers. (By the way, both earned five stars from me, so I have to work on a different grading system for Henry’s books like triple five stars, minus five stars, etc. But I\'m sure each of her books will become my favorite romance readings of the year, even though Colleen Hoover releases a book at the same time. Yep, ColHo fans, I’m one of yours, but fair is fair! Emily Henry is a true musician and poet playing the strings of my heart.)But let\'s be honest: Miles Nowak is the BEST BOYFRIEND Emily Henry has created! He’s caring, a charm magnet, selfless, easy-going, adventurous – not only the best boyfriend but also the best male friend any woman seeks. His irresistible hotness is the cherry on top. I\'m usually irritated by the heroes Emily Henry creates, but so far, Miles has exceeded them with his good heart, sense of humor, naturalness, without having a selfish bone in his body!I have to admit I had doubts when I first decided to read this book because I\'ve never been a fan of love triangles or ex-lover situations. When they are involved, things get messier, and emotions get blurrier. Most characters do something irritating, missing the ex or trying to rekindle, which pisses me off.I won\'t give spoilers, but I can say this: the situation of becoming roommates with your ex-fiancée’s new fiancée’s ex-boyfriend couldn’t be handled very gently and fairly. Both Daphne and Miles are wise, analyzing their situations very reasonably. When they accidentally find themselves in a fake dating situation, they even share their thoughts honestly. That’s why I loved both of the characters. They know their own flaws, weaknesses, and they don’t whine or obsess over their exes. They hold each other to get through the trauma, and from their mutual tragic incident, a beautiful, unique friendship is born. I loved how they slowly lowered down their barriers, learning to explore themselves and the huge life awaiting them. They acted so mature and were so careful not to be each other’s rebound, even though the sparks fly and burn the apartment they share to the ground.The plot revolves around Daphne, who loves the story of how she met her fiancée Peter until he dumps her after the bachelor party to choose his childhood friend Petra over her, giving her one week to move from their shared house, heading to the Amalfi Coast with his new girlfriend! Yes, what a jerk! Homeless and hopeless, Daphne, who recently left her old life behind to start a new life with Peter, finds Miles: Petra’s dumped a few minutes ago boyfriend at Peter’s door, and she pops up the question: is there any vacant room at your apartment?Yes, the equation might be too complicated. Daphne: reserved, tight-lipped, buttoned-up children’s librarian living with a carefree, adventurous, pothead guy who is working odd jobs, as her ex-fiancée defined. But when they get an invitation to Petra & Peter’s wedding, their very reserved roommate relationship changes after a night ends at the bar, and both of them decide to RSVP to the wedding. And guess what? The same day Peter makes a pity call that leads Daphne to lie about her relationship situation with Miles. She says they are dating, and thankfully Miles plays along with her game.But what if she misjudged Miles from the beginning? This self-deprecating, friendly guy who always puts others before him, comes to the library to cheer him up when she reads books to the kids, takes him places in town she has never seen, helps her open her mind and heart, rediscovering herself. Is he the guy her heart wants?Well, I loved Miles, I loved Daphne & Miles\' love story, and the beautiful epilogue in the end! No more words! Emily Henry never disappoints me! She meticulously solved this challenging relationship equation with the best possible outcome! Go on!

(the woman writes a mean substack.)there were a few things i didn\'t love about this book. it tries to fitso muchinto a few hundred pages: our protagonist, daphne, is left by her fiance weeks before her wedding, causing her to: move in with miles, her fiance\'s new girlfriend\'s ex-boyfriend; realize she has no friends; begin a quest to find herself; get over the fiancé and fall in love with miles; join a variety of community groups and neighborhood activities; make her current job her dream job; repress some CLEAR mommy issues i thought we were going to address, and fully get over her daddy issues.all of this is happening so much.it comes at a cost, which is that typical emily henry magic (and i don\'t just mean the bygone magical realism i mourn every day and never shut up about).this book is not quite as funny — jokes feel forced, sometimes to the point that you can only identify something as reaching for funny because the character ""joked"" or ""played along"" instead of ""said.""it is not quite as polished, with writing feeling a bit unconfident, full of words italicized for emphasis and, you know, the whole verbs that aren\'t said thing. (there are a LOT of dialogue attribution words that aren\'t ""said."")and the characters have none of their usual better-version-of-reality charm. miles\' nick miller archetype would never work for me personally, but my real issue with him is that his character traits fade once we\'re supposed to see him as a romantic prospect. our side characters, ashleigh and julia, feel like interchangeable joke-bots to the point of being vaguely threatening. (when they pop up on page in tandem i feel a sense of unease.)and to be honest, daphne has no self awareness. because there\'s so much happening in this book, everything has to be incredibly simple: daphne\'s issue with her dad, AND daphne\'s issue with miles, AND daphne\'s friends\' issue with daphne all has to be the same. it makes for some moments of ridiculousness — like how can daphne be melting down about being wronged on the same city block where she realized several hours earlier she had wronged someone in that exact same way? how could she be so unwilling to give the grace she expects for herself? and how could emily henry set scenes of this book on a cherry farm in michigan when she knew what it would do to me, specifically?!sorry. that\'s the last time i\'ll bring up magical realism. i think.ol\' daph just has too much to figure out about herself. i think this abandonment would be so completely traumatic even if she HADN\'T built her entire life around her fiancé only to be left entirely alone, and even if it WASN\'T eerily similar to her daddy issues, and even if she DIDN\'T have a bunch of unresolved things going on up in ye olde memory palace, that the last thing she\'d be doing is sticking around someone else\'s hometown flirting with her new roomie.especially since what she ends up doing is repeating the exact same cycle with no awareness at all.and in the worst offense, miles\' illiterate texting style reminded me of the himbos i used to date (date doing a lot of heavy lifting here) in my wayward youth. which should be a jailable offense in and of itself.bottom line: like anything emily henry has ever written, this is better than a lot of books. it just isn\'t better than most emily henry ones.----------------------currently-reading updateme

me.my current emily henry rom com ranking is: book lovers (5 stars), happy place (5 stars), beach read (4.5 stars), funny story (3 stars), and people we meet on vacation (2.5 stars). if we have completely different rankings, you\'ll probably feel differently about this book!if you are a big romance reader (reading booksforthe romance), you will most likely enjoy this a lot. but if you are a lit fic reader who loves emily henry books for the protagonists and their introspection and the fact that her romance feels grounded and realistic (me), this might be a slight miss. it\'s been a while since i\'ve described an emily henry book as just ""good"", but this one feels like that for me.funny story still has emily henry\'s signature witty dialogue and chemistry between miles and daphne. it is arguably her most commercial romance to date, filled with more romantic scenes between the two characters. daphne, after being dumped by her fiancé for his best friend, decides to room with miles, who was dumped by said best friend. in classic emily henry rom com style, funny story is set in a beautiful town in the midwest (michigan), charged with quick banter and heart to hearts between the characters. in this vein, the book felt like a mix of beach read and book lovers, in a sense.but not really. while it\'s impossible for me to dislike a emily henry book because of her writing, much of my enjoyment as a reader comes from being able to see myself and parts of my personality reflected through either protagonist. for book lovers, it was overwhelmingly nora, for happy place, it was harriet, for beach read, it was gus, and for people we meet on vacation, it was alex. and so on.the main qualm i had with funny story is that neither miles nor daphne felt relatable to me, which made it a less enjoyable read than her other books. this is why i say that my neutral stance on this book is most likely a personal one. daphne and miles both felt very confusing to me as characters, almost as if they were hybrids of emily henry\'s previous characters. i couldn\'t quite get either of their characterizations or defining traits. there is not a single emily henry book i didn\'t read in one sitting...until this one.like i mentioned above, a big reason for my love for emily henry books is her protagonists and how their introspection does not read like other commercial romance books, but more like literary fiction. her characters are well thought through, reflective, and very three dimensional. nora was literally just me from start to finish (so i don\'t have to really put forth a defense about three dimensionality). harriet\'s introspection on loneliness and living for other people genuinely changed my life. but daphne didn\'t really have any.the chemistry and get-together also felt a bit rushed and forced at times, and the dialogue and heart to hearts felt less genuine and blander than her other books. for a book called funny story, it was...not. i think my big issue was just with miles as well. he just didn\'t enough charisma and charm for this book to be memorable for me. wyn and alex didn\'t really either, but i related a lot to alex and wyn was redeemed through harriet.funny story is a great read and definitely still a cut above other romance books. but this one just didn\'t do it for me. i really hope her next release works for me!thank you berkley for the arc!⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻i didn\'t love this i\'m sorry guysreview to come⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻I GOT THE ARC WHOOOOOOO⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻emily henry ! do you want my firstborn? my college diploma? my kidney? you name it, it’s yours !!!'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4 stars!i have now read three emily henry books, and while she is undoubtedly a talented writer, what i find most fascinating is the loyalty of her readers; going to your nearest bookstore on release day for a book that is probably no less than $30 — that’s dedication. and you know what, i think i finally get it.i didn’t have particularly high expectations for funny story, but in all transparency, this just might be my favorite book of hers, hovering right above beach read (which i thoroughly enjoyed) and book lovers (of which i have no recollection but still think highly). it’s far from perfect, but it does a lot of things well, and that’s quite a feat considering it’s less than 400 pages (proof that less is more!) and, according to the reviews i’ve seen, her most “romantic” romance novel yet.still — i think funny story, like her other books, straddles the line between lighthearted romcom and introspective women’s fiction. the banter in this one is some of the best she’s written — it’s reread worthy, the kind that makes you laugh out loud. the characters themselves are wonderfully written; it’s obvious that emily henry adores them. she crafted miles and daphne with so much care and thought, adding dimension to the characters through their experiences and focusing on how said experiences changed and ultimately shaped them into the miles and daphne we read about in this book. it’s rare for me to like one mc in a romance book, let alone both, but daphne felt so relatable — her thoughts mirrored my very own at times. and miles i had a soft spot for because how could you not? he’sthis is me tryingpersonified. and the romance? god, the romance. i’m a harsh rater, even more so when it comes to contemporary romance. but in every! one! of! her! books! emily henry prioritizes the emotional connection between the two main characters. and the way she develops their relationship and has them slowly open up to each other? it gets me. every. time. i live for their vulnerable moments, for their conversations about their pasts, about what haunts them, as much as i live for their banter.despite this being first and foremost a romance, it is also a story about rediscovering yourself, relearning who you are and what you like and what you want out of life. it’s a reminder to live for yourself, to spend your days with the people you love, to love them without restraint or inhibition. the ending is beautifully uplifting, the last sentence tying back to the very first, the tone hopeful and reassuring. it’s what i think i needed right now as someone who’s entering her twenties and is so intimidated by the unknown, who’s tempted to run away from the unpredictability of it all. and i’m sure it’s a book i’ll come back to when, in five years, my life will probably make even less sense than it does now.thank you to netgalley and berkley publishing for the arc 💓'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Can a book survive on nothing but banter? Well,Funny Storysure tries.Okay, all you rabid Emily Henry fans. Before you chuck your rotten eggs at me, please let me explain.If ever there was an Emily Henry book that I should connect with, it's this one. Daphne is a librarian (my dream job) and she's in a pretend relationship with her roommate, Miles, in order to get back at her ex-fiancé (an intriguing premise). And yet, something was missing. I kept waiting for the story to grab me, and it never really did.I hate to say it, but the crux of the problem is that the whole thing was rather forgettable. I only just finished the book, and already I hardly remember anything about it. The characters, the interactions, even the conflicts, while all feelgood on the surface, were in fact fairly bland underneath.I enjoy a low-stakes beach read as much as the next gal, but there is a difference between low stakes and no stakes, and this was too much in the latter. At no point was there anything really on the line. The story just shambled along, with lots of banter and some minor conflicts here and there, until the requisite 300-some pages were met, and then it was called a book.Speaking of the conflicts, I totally didn't understand Daphne and Miles' issues, or even Daphne and Ashleigh's. Do people really get so upset and potentially break up relationships and friendships over such small issues? And each one, blown up to be so important, can only be resolved after much back and forth, with pages upon pages of dialogue of each person's feelings and the associated parental trauma that was at the root of all their misgivings. It was a bit much.Don't get me wrong, I did have fun. There were entertaining moments, and the banter was truly top notch. And it wasn't just for the main couple during romantic moments. No, the banter was interspersed everywhere and among everyone, so we got plenty of chuckle-worthy moments.But you can't just sustain a story on banter alone, no matter how delightful it is. When the characters feel as lackluster as Daphne and Miles and their conflicts equally bland and forced, it was hard to care either way if they ended up together, which is always a bad sign in a romance.I feel like I'm the only person out there who doesn't get heart-eyes at the merest mention of an Emily Henry book. My experiences so far have been largely underwhelming, or maybe I just haven't read the right books by her. Either way, I'll add this to the pile of Emily Henry books I've pretty much forgotten the moment I finished.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:Beach ReadPeople We Meet on Vacation~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'funny story? ha. ain’t nothing funny about the way my heart was tugged while reading this book. emily henry im under your bed cuz why’d you write a fmc that has the same thoughts and fears as me?!? 💀opposites attract has never been written better than before this. Daphne and Miles were written for each other like a prophecy. this is one of emily’s most horniest books yet, and i was there for it all the way through. “his mouth is still cool from the lemonade, his breath tinged with hints of lavender, and his hand slides around to the small of my back, fisting into my shirt…” i love these descriptions. there was something very tender when he said “always so buttoned up” to Daphne, who’s a librarian, as he was ripping her clothes off. 🫶🏽i just know if i had an attentive, calm, loving, cherishing, beautiful man like Miles in my life he’d be extremely manly to the point where i can turn off my brain, be a girly girl, and not have a worry in the world. his gentle love felt like a caress to my soul. the way he effortlessly took care of her, saw the signs, respected her space and mind. Miles…YOU GOT IT LIKE THAT?!? he makes me feel like im standing in sunlight☀️lives were changed when Miles said, “ I know I’m not who you pictured yourself with, but I think I could be, eventually.

Because you’re my best friend, and I’m in love with you.” brother my knees just hit the floor in the middle of walmart😭Daphne such a well rounded character. her fears were so real and the way she overcame them was nothing if not humbling. emily writes her fmc so nuanced and layered and deep. i feel like she’s writing about me and im ok with that 😁also if i ever catch Peter in public im throwing a brick at himemily henry books ranking:1) beach read2) funny story3) book lovers4) people we meet on vacation5) happy place'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""i'm all for recycling but does she have to keep writing the same book every yearboring. repetitive. bland characters. a mc that moans every time she eats something (is this some kind of weird new sex thing. was i supposed to be turned on. sparks were definitely flying but that's just because i considered setting myself and the book on fire multiple times). i was actually gonna give this two stars but the more i think about it the more i hate it. also i'm in a very bad mood. lol.i have said it with book lovers before and i will say it again: all her books feel the same. wake me up in two days time and yell the names alex, gus, and miles at me and i will struggle assigning them to the right books. i don't even remember happy places mmc... and i actually liked that book... meh whatever.those two had about the same amount of chemistry as me and that work project i have been putting off for weeks because it bores me to death just thinking about. watching paint dry would have been more exciting than reading this. maybe it isn't too late yet. someone get me a brush.my theory concerning emily henry's popularity on goodreads is that she always writes about female characters that in one shape or another love books. and... that's basically most of the demographic here so. which is fine and yay yippiee juhu, representation (the poor underrepresented class of *checks notes* white cishet female readers) but like .... please write a book that isn't just the previous ones rearranged and glued together?also, the story wasn't even funny???""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4.5 stars!

Sometimes, just when it feels like smooth sailing on the raft you call a life, an unexpected fucker of a wave smashes your plans to splinters and send you off course and adrift. Such is the case for Daphne in Emily Henry’s charming new novel,Funny Story, whose life has been shipwrecked upon the shores of a Lake Michigan vacation town with the ex of her ex’s new fiance. You read that right, and these mutual exes are such a smart match they are practically named after each other, Peter and Petra, so out with the tweed and in with the twee I suppose. But, as Daphne learns, sometimes a shipwreck can be a new start to something more beautiful. One of this books biggest strengths in allowing the narrative to wade through sorrows to create a portrait of adults discovering how to carry their own baggage and how their interactions with others are affected by it with a lot of the drama not being a miscommunication trope, per say, but more people tripping themselves up into confirmation bias based on their own personal traumas. It has some grit that grounds the otherwise breezy narrative and the real love story is learning to love oneself in order to love and be loved. It does wrap up a bit overly idyllic but honestly, I felt the biggest cracks in the veneer of the story was when it tried to make things happier than it probably needed to be but I understand why that is the case. With her signature witty banter, wry humor, and characters that are easy to fall in love with as they fall apart and into love themselves,Funny Storyis a endearing tale about picking up the pieces only to discover oneself amidst the wreckage, learn to be yourself for yourself, and find a love where you least expect.‘The same universe that dispassionately takes things away can bring you things you weren't imaginative enough to dream up.’Alright let’s talk about love and stuff (surprise: the “stuff” is trauma!) I foundFunny Storyto read as a much quieter novel than most of Emily Henry’s works, but also found that, coupled with a slow-burn plot that lets scenes and character introspection really breathe, to be part of what made it so endearing for me. This will probably take some criticism for being slow but my favorite books are the sort that don’t exactly have what most people call a “plot” soooo this was fine for me.Funny Storyreads more along the lines of the coziness inBook Loverswhile also being more successful than I foundHappy Placeto be. Having just readLynn Painter’sHappily Never After, I felt like this was a successful version of the many things that story tried to be (both books, however, have a thing about eating pizza being sexy which…ok…???) where the characters actually felt their age, the fake dating felt plausible, the third act drama was passably believable for the genre. It does try to tie up too many loose ends and solve all the issues and I don't think we needed that, but I suppose cliches are cliche for a reason and there are expectations in genres so thats more a Me thing. And like, sure there's a lot to pick at but also it’s aiming to be a fun book and it lands that aspect while also managing to have a dynamic look at how past hurts can haunt our self-esteem and hinder our vulnerability when trying to connect with others and that helped hold the story together. One person's breakdown is another person’s novel glue I guess? Wait, I think I just finally understood literature.‘You can't force a person to show up, but you can learn a lesson when they don't.’This is a fairly character driven narrative of self-discovery and trauma processing that just so happens to stumble into romance so having the characters be in their early 30s helped bring this to life. Also that everything sucks and they just keep having to go to work and smile because they work public facing jobs–I FELT THAT SO HARD. I’ve found in similar novels that the characters felt far too young for their ages whereasFunny Storycaptures being an adult but not having the stable career/family/housing/etc that would make one “feel adult.” It's a very Millennial narrative where jokes like ‘are we evil or just immature?’ to laugh off behavior felt very true to life and all these characters seemed to walk onto the page directly out of the sort of single, early 30s service industry folks I’ve known and been friends with. But it also positions the characters in the wreckage of their Round 1 attempt at adulthood where they can no longer pretend they aren’t a product of their past and have to weigh out how their past traumas and coping mechanisms have embedded into their personalities. Especially since both Miles and Daphne are still reeling from hurts caused by the actions of their parents and don’t have a healthy relationship to serve as a compass for their own (and Daphne’s father is still a source of constant disappointment). ‘I don’t want you to look at me like I’m broken,’ Miles says at one point and this cuts to the heart of how these character’s present themselves: eager to show they are alright while feeling far from fine inside and wanting to hide that.’It’s easy to be loved by the ones who’ve never seen you fuck up. The ones you’ve never had to apologize to, and who still think all your ‘quirks’ are charming.’Since so much of dating involves understanding each other’s defense mechanisms and unpacking how past traumas inform your interpersonal relationships, being able to be vulnerable is important to intimacy andFunny Storydoes well by showing how frustrating it can be to open yourself up at the same emotional places where you are currently bruised. Though, speaking of intimacy, readers should know Emily Henry is not a closed-door romance writer (as Ashleigh says it is ‘definitely not PG’) and while the sex scenes are fairly awkward here (I suspect the term “cringe” will get used in a lot of reviews) I think thats part of their charm as these are just…awkward people. Henry wrote a rather humorous article (read itHERE) on how to write sex scenes and the key detail she returns to several times is vulnerability and embracing the awkward, but also using the scenes to progress the characters.‘The scene has to change things. Because every scene has to change things.And that’s it. As close as I think I could get teaching someone to write (or rewrite) a sex scene. You have to treat it like any other scene, because that’s what it is…It has to move the story. It has to shift the emotional landscape. It doesn’t have to be universally deemed sexy (it can’t; people like different things) and it doesn’t have to avoid the territory of cringe (it won’t, for the aforementioned reason). It simply has to be true to the story.’While I’m not sure the scenes here really count as plot progression, I found the awkwardness that leaves the characters rather flustered and confused about their relationship to work as part of the character study that seems to be the focus of this book. Its a novel about finding yourself but thankfully its not white folks “finding themselves” by going to India or Joshua Tree listening to The Doors, its just getting high and watching action movies with your roommate and getting some “accidental” action of your own.‘She’s a walking fantasy and I’m a librarian who actually does wear a lot of buttons and tweed.’Learning to love oneself in all your faults and failures is difficult, but the joy in the discovery of what makes you “you” comes alive through Daphne quite well. The set up is pretty great and Henry launches you into it rather quickly. I do enjoy how it sort of mimics the set up inBook Loverswhere she gets dumped in a very romcom ending “I realized my best friend was my love all along” way like Daphne is the discard fiance that barely gets any lines and seems lame anyways (so I guess shoutout to anyone who maybe identified with Mark Ruffalo’s fiance in13 Going On 30?). This is just another incident in a long line of feeling not important in the lives of those who claim to love you, and having had an absentee father taught her a few self-defense mechanisms long ago:‘Trust people’s actions, not their words.Don’t love anyone who isn’t ready to love you back.Let go of the people who don’t hold on to you.Don’t wait on people who don’t jury for you.’Being free from a relationship she thought would sail her happily from life has also made her reflect on how she never really formed a solid sense of self and instead allowed a relationship to fill in all the blanks for her. ‘I always cleaved to people I love and tried to orient my orbit around them,’ she realizes, which was an attempt to ‘make myself unleavable.’ And guess what? They all left. But now she has a new opportunity to find herself in it all.‘Im not sure which parts of me are him and which parts are genuinely my own and I want to know. I want to know myself, to test my edges and see where I stop and the rest of the world begins.’Having also ended up in a Michigan lakeshore vacation town only for my supposedly “got it together” lifeplans to go down like the Edmund Fitzgerald (if you are from Michigan you are required to love the Edmund Fitzgerald and think of the Great Lakes like some fierce god that gives life but takes it away. Any museum is like “Science/Art/History/etc is so cool!” Michigan museums are like “the Lake is a cruel mistress who will kill you and everyone you love!”), this all resonated with me. Too much maybe. But I loved seeing her come to love it and find her own place. ‘I feel embarrassing pride at having become a regular at someplace new all on my own,’ she thinks about becoming a familiar face in a coffee shop. Can confirm that is a cool feeling when you feel utterly alone in the world. Good for you, Daphne, find your place.‘There’s no place on this earth like Waning Bay.’Speaking of place, Emily Henry excels at capturing a sense of place and embedding it into her narratives as if the local community itself were a supporting cast character in her romcoms. It helps, too, that her locales tend to offer plenty of comedic relief along with their atmosphere. Henry has spoken at length about the importance of “place” in crafting her novelsin interviews, stating that ‘I want my characters to feel like they grew up in the place where [my books are] set.’ InFunny Story, however, we watch Daphne as she has to learn a new place being stuck in a Northern Michigan vacation community, but it is less the way learning a place is about learning to better understand her love interest as it was inBook Loversand more about learning to understand herself. Luckily she is aided by her new roommate, Miles, who also had to find his way amidst this community after shipwrecking there himself (can relate, buddy). Henry captures these Michigan communities in highly specific and humorous ways while making it still relatable to those unfamiliar with them. Maybe I’m biased and Daphne being a librarian and Miles being a bartender at a cherry themed wine bar is just something I’d enjoy because I work in a library after having myself been a wine bartender at a cherry themed establishment. But aspects of Michigan vacation towns felt so true to life. I laughed at the bar named “BARn” which is so eye-rollingly Michigan. But also aspects like seeing a young couple that are ‘on a first date which might somehow be an actual vacation,’ or everyone having their “corn guy, jam connection or cheesemonger, or someone saying things like being on the water is probably what church is to some folks. But for real, if you need amazing tomatoes, I know a guy.‘A good librarian makes all the difference.’The side characters are great as well, like the younger sister who brings in a lot of heartfelt discussions on family dynamics in response to family traumas, or the single-mom librarian. The library aspects are a bit kitschy but charming and I’m glad Henry presents the very real issues of how much blatant sexual harassment librarians face or the random moments of extreme anger or weirdness and how we just…deal with it and move along like a blip in the day. I usually hate when authors add libraries or librarians into plots because it's so stereotypically twee or inaccurate but Henry pulls it off well. Back to the sister for a moment, I thought the age gap between siblings was explored in a pretty comically-true-to-life way and how it wasn’t miscommunication between them but just…lack of communicating at all because you just assume what the other person is thinking. Which, okay real. That plays into the third act drama as well where its less a miscommunication and more falling victim to your own confirmation bias and assumptions. But Miles is sweet. I really liked Miles, guys. Miles feels like people I've met, especially in my bartending days. Also a coworker told me they think Miles is based on me. He’s not, I don’t own crocs (shoutout to the cover artist for including that). Did he do something sort of uncool at the end that Daphne is understandably upset about? Yes. Not great. But also did it feel like...well, something you'd hear a friend tell you about why their mad at a guy? Absolutely.I also don't know if this actually needed a successful romance? Maybe that's just me but the aspect about loving yourself and existing outside the circle of your partner was pretty great and we could have left it at that.‘A second act I fell into, and the home that I chose, as much as it chose me.I can’t wait. I can’t wait for this whole world I’ve invited to surprise me.’All in all,Funny Storyis a sweet story of summer, libraries and finding joy in a new town and new friend. What I really loved about this book—even when it made me cry because Isobbedat the end—is how it just felt like people interacting with people and stumbling through their own issues instead of having some driving plot pushing people in directions. What I’m getting at is they felt like people instead of chess pieces for the sake of plot. The third act drama is done well too. Though when Henry tries to tell you that Michiganders refer to vacationers as “fudgies” for coming here to get our fudge (which is yum)...no we don’t. But the people from the Upper Peninsula DO in fact call the lower Peninsula “trolls.” Nobody in this novel says “ope” though, which is the Michigan noise for everything. Daphne should have said “ope” during a sex scene, I would have fallen over and then made this novel the State flag or something. Anyways, I enjoyed this and I hope you will too.4/5‘Family. The real kind, who will always love you, even when your decisions make no sense to them.’UPDATE: I totally bought the Emily Henry merch shirt for this book.

I would have loved to live this romance.I couldn't give this 5 stars (for personal reasons), because I winced at certain moments and was like 'why isn't love like this in real life'. ⋆𐙚₊˚⊹♡I'm going to read another of her books - which one should I read?⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ ── reading log22/05 1:21pm ୨ৎthey're so sweet together im so jealous why isn't love like this in real life see this is why i have issues22/05 9:00am ୨ৎawww I relate to her relationship with her mum21/05 1:09pm ୨ৎNO its all too quick21/05 11:26am ୨ৎhe's kind of cute yknow 😳︶︶︶ ⊹ ︶︶︶⠀୨♡୧⠀︶︶︶ ⊹ ︶︶︶⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ ── pre-readingit's happening... this certified romance cynic is reading her first emily henry book. i will keep my complaining to a minimum i swear︶︶︶ ⊹ ︶︶︶⠀୨♡୧⠀︶︶︶ ⊹ ︶︶︶may tbr:ಇ.salt to the seaಇ. powerlessಇ. house of earth and bloodಇ. everyone in my family has killed someoneಇ. brideಇ. listen for the lieಇ. she's not sorryಇ. love on the brainಇ. the familiarಇ.a court of wings and ruin+a good girl's guide to murder+the clinic+a court of frost and starlight+funny story""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""★ 2.75 starsi guess it’s time for me to start considering that maybe i’m notexactlythe target audience for Emily Henry’s books.see, i don’t think she’s a bad author. i really don’t. believe it or not, i do think she’s a good writer and i can understand (to a certain extent) why most people are obsessed with her work.but as much as i tried and keep trying, i can’t be one of those people.aside from this book, i’ve read four other books by EH. you can easily guess which ones because they are her most popular:Beach Read,Book Lovers,People We Meet On VacationandHappy Place. i hatedBook Lovers&PWMOV, but enjoyedBeach ReadandHappy Place[she’s very hit or miss as you can notice]. however, while these two books were enjoyable — back when i read them, at least — i can’t exactly say i was obsessed with them. were they good? well, yes, but they weren’t perfect and i personally found them a bit overhyped. my not-so-extraordinary experiences with her past works were the main reason why i didn’t have high expectations forFunny Story. although, deep down, i wanted it to be the book that would make me say “wow... now i really understand all the hype she gets, i’m definitely an Emily Henry fan now!” but that obviously did not happen.it’s such a shame because this book actually started off good. i mean... kind of. in the first 50% i was convinced that this was going to be a 3 star read — i know people have different thoughts about three star ratings; some think it’s reserved for bad reads, others think it’s reversed for decent/‘just okay’ reads. in my opinion, it can mean both, it just depends on the book.at first, i thoughtFunny Storywould be getting the “decent/‘just okay’ three star rating” from me. i was liking some things, but disliking others.our female main character,Daphne Vincent, was one of the things i was liking. she was imperfect and flawed, but also realistic, which was a nice thing to me. i prefer reading stories with characters who are not perfect and have flaws because that makes them feel more human, real, and easy to relate with. of course there were particular things i didn’t like about her and i won’t lie that sometimes throughout the book i found myself getting annoyed at her, but generally speaking, Daphne was not an awful character. not the most remarkable or loveable if we’re being brutally honest — i do wish Emily had given her a more captivating personality, but she was still likeable despite that so i’m not going to complain much. my favorite thing about her character is probably the fact that she is a librarian, how cool is that? she’s living the dream!as for our male main character,Miles Nowak... um, was i supposed to care about him? because i didn’t, sorry. honestly, Miles is not even a bad MMC and i truly had nothing against him — the thing is that i just found him uninteresting and rather forgettable. sure, he was cool guy occasionally and he had a few nice moments, but that’s about it. nothing more to tell you. Miles didn’t have any outstanding or charming qualities in my opinion and i was pretty indifferent about him for the majority of the book. i thought he would win me over eventually, but eh, he never did.the story itself was not the bestest and most interesting i’ve ever read, but the positive thing is that it was keeping me somewhat entertained. even with its issues, i was not bored and i wanted to keep reading more and more. i even started feeling a tad hopeful that things would improve at some point because i could see some potential there. but guess what? it did not improve. in fact, it got worse.i don’t know where exactly things started going wrong, all i can tell you is that after 50% i lost all my interest in the story.i assume it might be because of the romance. Daphne and Miles started having more “romantic” scenes and i was not interested in that. not even a little bit. from the beginning, i couldn’t feel any chemistry between them and their romantic interactions were all so cringe and unnatural to me. just unpleasing to read. so yeah, it actually makes sense why i lost interest when they really started becoming more than friends.i genuinely enjoyed the friendship between these two, their dynamic as friends was fun and sweet, but as a couple? oh, absolutely NOT. when i read romance books i surely expect to root for the main characters to end up together, because duh, butFunny Storymade me do the exact opposite. Daphne and Miles should’ve stayed as friends and friends only and i’ll die on this hill. no one can convince me otherwise. it’s not even just because i think they havezerochemistry, there are another million reasons why i think that that they shouldn’t be a couple. the biggest one is that neither of them were very prepared to embark in another serious relationship so quickly (nor they should). they should take care of themselves first and get therapy instead.on top of that, the author also started coming up with unnecessary and tedious subplots. like for example the dad subplot — the most boring — and i just... couldn’t take it anymore. i was getting more and more annoyed and the urge to give up was very strong at that point, but i kept pushing through. i don’t know why, though? it wasn’t even worth it.then... when i thought it couldn’t get any worse... the author throws in a ✨third act conflict✨ and what a stupid, irritating third act conflict it was. was it even necessary? it came out of nowhere and the whole thing felt way too forced and annoying.i got so angry at Miles’ actions and i don’t think Daphne was that wrong or immature for reacting the way she did. the conflict just proves my point that they! were! not! ready! for! a! relationship! (well, mainly Miles.)ironically, for a book calledFunny Story, this wasn’t funny at all. it’s not the worst book i’ve ever read (trust me when i say i’ve read worse) but it’s not one of the best either... it was just not for me i guess. i still recommend it, though — i feel like others might like it more than me. i certainly hope they do.𓂃 ⚝ 𓂃 ๋. ₊ ꒰ ✉️favorite quotes. ꒱ ₊ . ๋ 𓂃 ⚝ 𓂃“The same universe that dispassionately takes things away can bring you things you weren't imaginative enough to dream up.”“You can’t untell someone your secrets.

You can't unsay those delicate truths once you learn you can't trust the person you handed them to.”➛ this book also talks about some parental abuse that i honestly do not think i’ve ever read about before, and i know it is going to mean a lot to a lot of people. also the way that miles handles that trauma in the present day was something that really made me feel seen and meant more to me than i have words to put in a review here.“I need it to be okay. Because I need to be okay. As a kid, I just felt so fucking scared and powerless, all the time, and now, I just need to be okay.”➛ and this is also just such a book about community, and carving out space and safety and love with the people who you trust and want to build a home with. especially when you’ve lived a life of not really having much stability, and the thought of it being taken away makes you scared to start to build it.➛ libraries will always be the heart of cities, with some of the most powerful tools we have to amplify voices and create change. i am actually typing this up during national library week here, and i just can't emphasize enough how important these buildings, these safe spaces filled with heart, and these librarians are. i would get so emotional when daphne would talk about the kids at her branch, and the books she’d pick because of them. ahhhh, a reminder to just show up for your local library, do donations if you are able (time, books, and money), make sure your library card is updated, just show your appreciation in every way you’re able to.“To me, libraries have always represented the best of humanity. The way we all share knowledge and space, and... and how we find ways to look after each other. It's not a perfect system, but it's powerful.”overall, this just had so much to love. actually, as i am typing this i am considering making this a five star. I’m just not sure if i loved this as much asbeach read, but it is for sure a new favorite emily henry of mine. but miles is for sure the best love interest she, or maybe any other contemporary author, has ever written. and i absolutely cannot wait to watch you all fall with both him, and daphne, and their amazing funny story.trigger + content warnings:drinking, smoking, a joke about suicide, brief mention of fetishization (to a side character and in a negative light), parental abandonment and neglect and and instability in past, child abuse in past, mention of loss of parents in past (side character), one sentence mention of cancer (side characters parent), anxiety depiction, and just a story about people going through a really hard break up that has a little bit of infidelity vibes (even though no cheating did occur to them)♡evie'samazing spotify playlistblog|instagram|youtube|wishlist|spotify|amazon♡Beach Read★★★★♡Happy Place★★★""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""“I don’t know how to talk along the surface of things, but I also don’t want to unearth the ugly stuff, over and over again, for people who are just passing through my life.

You can’t untell someone your secrets. You can’t unsay those delicate truths once you learn you can’t trust the person you handed them to.”— Emily Henry is never beating the ✨ sorcery allegations ✨when she keeps writing my thoughts and experiences. This isThe Tortured Poet's Departmentcoded with elements ofMidnightsin the second half of the book. This book was everything I didn't know I needed and I'm going to need Emily to write more contemporary romance books immediately.— The romance is a heavier focus compared to some of her other work, however it still had Emily's character driven stories, witty humour and introspection. This will be very subjective depending on your own personal connection to these characters and stories but I felt so seen in this book. This was a personal experience for me as it always is with Emily's books and I found it emotional at times.➳Daphneis up there with one of the most relatable FMC's for me. She's cynical about love and has been neglected by most people in her life. The romance was a large factor, but Daphne's fear of abandonment, parental issues and cynical nature gave me the emotional depth I crave in Emily's books. Daphne's abandonment issues are incredibly realistic and I got teary towards the end seeing how this has shaped her life.The Prophecyfrom TTPD this is so Daphne coded as she doesn't feel like she belongs anywhere with family, friends or relationships.“You can’t force a person to show up, but you can learn a lesson when they don’t. Trust people’s actions, not their words. Don’t love anyone who isn’t ready to love you back. Let go of the people who don’t hold on to you. Don’t wait on anyone who’s in no rush to get to you.”➳Milesis portrayed as the well-liked and free-spirited personality, however, he has a depth to him once he opens up. He's very patient and in tune with the emotions of people around him. He's an optimist and I loved how he turned Daphne's pessimistic statement's into something positive. I love his personality and banter so I will forgive him for wearing crocs all the time 🫣“It’s easy to be around people who don’t know you. But as soon as someone starts to figure you out—as soon as you can’t be perfect—it’s easier to move on. Find someone new to be the cool, fun, laid-back one with.”➳PeterandPetraare terrible people. I found Peter especially triggering. He's the guy that always wants what he doesn't have and can't let others be happy without him. Petra got off too easy for her behaviour.➳Ashleighis a side character but she offered a lot to this story. I loved thefound familyaspect she brought but also her own experiences also added depth to the story. I loved her moment with Daphne towards the end of the book which offered constructive feedback to Daphne's response to conflict.➳The romancehad me kicking my feet like a love-struck teenager. They were so adorable and the chemistry and tension was palpable. The angst was on nearly every page and while the sexual tension was amazing, it wasn't instant love and their relationship offered so much more than sexual chemistry. They did trauma bond to an extent at the start but it's very clear that their chemistry was not a consequence of the hand they were dealt. This is very loosely fake dating — It could had fallen into so many other tropes but I loved the direction Emily took and she really let the characters stand on their own.“I want to kiss you, every time you take a sip of something and make that sound. I want to kiss you every time I walk past your bedroom and hear your laugh through the door. I want to kiss you every time I hear the shower turn on and know that you’re in there. I want to kiss you all the time, Daphne. Sometimes it’s just easier to find an excuse.”— There's a conflict towards the end and people might have some mixed feelings about it. I personally thought it was realistic because I related to the characters I would have felt the same. I don't pick Emily's books up with the expectation of it being a fluffy. I crave the introspection so I was not disappointed. It goes without saying that her writing is beautiful and witty — she had me laughing, blushing and crying.

A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #2)
",Sarah J. Maas,4.65,2470134,550147,"Fantasy, Romance, Young Adult, New Adult, Fiction, Romantasy, Fae",626,03-05-2016,"The seductive and stunning #1 New York Times bestselling sequel to Sarah J. Maas's spellbinding A Court of Thorns and Roses .Feyre has undergone more trials than one human woman can carry in her heart. Though she's now been granted the powers and lifespan of the High Fae, she is haunted by her time Under the Mountain and the terrible deeds she performed to save the lives of Tamlin and his people.As her marriage to Tamlin approaches, Feyre's hollowness and nightmares consume her. She finds herself split into two different one who upholds her bargain with Rhysand, High Lord of the feared Night Court, and one who lives out her life in the Spring Court with Tamlin. While Feyre navigates a dark web of politics, passion, and dazzling power, a greater evil looms. She might just be the key to stopping it, but only if she can harness her harrowing gifts, heal her fractured soul, and decide how she wishes to shape her future-and the future of a world in turmoil.Bestselling author Sarah J. Maas's masterful storytelling brings this second book in her dazzling, sexy, action-packed series to new heights.","[{'rating': 5, 'content': 'Rating: All the stars in the universe""I needed not to be dead when I agreed.”“You needed not to be alone.”I don\'t really know what to say in order to adequately express how stunningA Court of Mist and Furyis. How exquisitely beautiful. How slow-burningly sorrowful. How... joyous at the same time. I\'m at a lack of words for describing how it truly made mefeel-- because this book resonates with my soul and my heart and my mind so wonderfully, it just filled me with awe from within, leaving me drowning in an eternal swirl of emotions, a ruin because of a mere novel.“But then she snapped your neck.”Tears rolled down his face.“And I felt you die,” he whispered.Tears were sliding down my own cheeks.This book is a story aboutlifeandloveand every gray shade in between. A story about the bleak days and the lovely winds of change. A story about hard-fought happiness and soul-wrenching sacrifices. And a story about a girl who finds herself drifting away into the fields of nothingness only to discover the stars and moon and night sky pointing towards her glorious rebirth.Feyre, oh dear Feyre. I amso so proudof her and who she\'s become at the end of the novel. She\'s so exhilarating and vibrant and incredibly strong. But she was not like this in the beginning. The events in the previous book shredded her apart from the inside out, living only a shell of the brave young woman we cheered for. My heart ached for her. But she finds herself again -- her true self, her wild heart, her luminous spark of daring, fierce, brilliant dreams. And the heroine that emerges is coated with sheer determination, powerful bravery and astounding compassion.I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal.I was a survivor, and I was strong.I would not be weak, or helpless again.I would not, could not be broken. Tamed.I want to assure everyone that not one character,NO ONE, acts OOC. And besides Feyre, no one changes. You know what I\'m talking about -- the alpha-males vulturing around Feyre. ACoTaR only showed us bits and pieces, but we mustn\'t jump to the wrong conclusions about certain people especially since the depth of ACoTaR felt (at least to me) similar to a Vegas wedding after meeting a guy in the hotel lobby, whereasACoMaF was a reality check. Harsh and cruel and unyielding.This being said, I liked Tamlin. He was true to himself. Everything he does, he does out of love and of fear of losing Feyre. And we all know that people blinded by love can often make mistakes -- and Tam did. Many mistakes. A lack of understanding intoxicated him and an imperative need for control severed his perception. Paradoxically, we get to know him better even if he\'s not a present figure throughout the book. And perhaps, now that we\'ve seen more of his layers and facades... perhaps we see him in a much different light. He has issues and I truly believe Amarantha messed him up mentally -- nowhere near the trauma Feyre endured, but still a haunting scar imprinted on his demeanor. Regardless, do not mistake all I\'ve said as excuses in his defense, because they are not. They do not excuse his ultimate authority, his condescending attitude and his infuriatingly rash decisions for which he does need to suffer the consequences.I just cannot wait to see him get his ass handed to him by Feyre.“He did—does love me, Rhysand.”“The issue isn’t whether he loved you, it’s how much. Too much. Love can be a poison.”Rhysand, on the other hand, was the epitome ofdamn. I might even have a confession to make... He might...*gulp*... have overthrown Will Herondale and Dorian Havilliard as my favorite book boyfriend!!Rhys embodies the highest standards for fictional males. His bad-boy allure. His arrogance. His cunning mind. His elegance. His astounding power. But these are nothing compared to his internal beauty -- his selflessness, his nerve-wrecking intensity, his carefully crafted mask, his turmoil and his kindness. His self-doubt brought me to my knees, because he is such a precious cinnamon roll and he doesn\'t realize it. Andholy shithis past was just too much --I WAS (AM) AN EMOTIONAL MESS.“You think I don’t know how stories get written—how this story will be written?” Rhys put his hands on his chest, his face more open, more anguished than I’d seen it. “I am the dark lord, who stole away the bride of spring. I am a demon, and a nightmare, and I will meet a bad end. He is the golden prince—the hero who will get to keep you as his reward for not dying of stupidity and arrogance.”And you wanna know what?HE\'S A GODDAMN FEMINIST. If that doesn\'t make you fall in love with him head over heels, I don\'t know what will. Plus Rhys is basically the hottest fictional guy ever created (Darkling + Warner + Dorian = omg). WHY ISN\'T HE REAL???*sobs*“Tamlin won’t allow it.”“Tamlin isn’t your keeper, and you know it.”“I’m his subject, and he is my High Lord—”“You are no one’s subject.”***“Maybe it’d be a mercy to be ended—A broad hand gripped my face—gently enough not to hurt, but hard enough to make me look at him. “Don’t you ever think that,” Rhysand hissed, his eyes livid. “Not for one damned moment.”***""She wins,” Rhys breathed. “That bitch wins if you let yourself fall apart.""Lucien remains clever and intuitive and even though his relationship with our heroine gets stranded, his only flaw is undying, blind loyalty and I cannot fault him for that.Moving now onto more serious topics -- the new characters. We have quite a lot, but by far the loveliest ones are Rhysand\'s Inner Circle.They\'re squad goals. FierceMorrigan; strange and kickassAmren; sassy, arrogant and skilledCassian; reserved and observantAzriel. All these, plus Rhys, entangle a dynamic that createsa family. I loved them to bits. Secondary characters, yet so wonderfully nuanced, three-dimensional characters that gut you with their own stories and make you shed a tear at how much they love each other. Plus, they cracked me up on a constant basis. And the respect and unflinching support they have between them was all kinds ofwowandawwww.Okay. Enough with the stalling. Let\'s venture into dangerous territory akathe romance.*deep breath*I want to start by sayingthere is no love triangle-- there\'s onlya wonderful, all-consuming and healthyrelationship that evolves naturally until it reaches paramount heights. I was constantly plastered with a stupid, goofy grin on my face whenever this couple interacted or was simply in the same scene. What makes them absolutely beautiful in my perspective isthe mutual respect, honesty and supportthey have for each other -- it paints them with anempoweringand downright heartwarming glow. Their amazingfriendship, their sparkingchemistry, their hilariousbanterand their hot as helltensionhad me repeatedly blessing the gods for Maas.“He locked you up because he knew—the bastard knew what a treasure you are. That you are worth more than land or gold or jewels. He knew, and wanted to keep you all to himself.”***“I’m thinking,” he said, following the flick of my tongue over my bottom lip, “that I look at you and feel like I’m dying. Like I can’t breathe.”Besides those strong traits of their relationship, I need to mention the steaminess and sexiness and overallHOTNESS.Because this book? It\'s hot. Like black-in-the-middle-of-July-in-California-hot. NA, after all. You thought ACoTaR was hot?YOU THOUGHT WRONG-- prepare yourself for hyperventilating, fangirling and swooning, \'cause SJM\'s writing skills slay in those scenes.“I heard every word between you. I knew you could take care of yourself, and yet … ” He went back to his pie, swallowing a bite before continuing. “And yet I found myself deciding that if you took his hand, I would find a way to live with it. It would be your choice.”I sipped from my wine. “And if he had grabbed me?”There was nothing but uncompromising will in his eyes. “Then I would have torn apart the world to get you back.”Oh oh oh but there are some other ships that get my blood pumping even though they\'re not sailing -- YET THEY SHOULD. They totally should. Mozriel and Nessian embody pure awesomeness.And Elain and Lucien will be so interesting to see play out!What I enjoyed tremendously about this particular sequel is how it managed to expand the realm beyond its initial borders, in terms of world-building, depth and history. ACoTaR now seems like a small piece of a giant puzzle, the lovely but common retelling ofBeauty and the Beastpaling in comparison to ACoMaF which, while just teasing us with glimpses of the real deal that\'s to come, contained a sense of radiant and vastepicness.The most special and bewildering aspect is the lush and vivid portrayal of the Night Court. Enthralling and contradictory, it completely enraptures you with its seductive tone. So different from the Spring Court (and Summer Court which we get to visit!!). But I expected something disheartening and equally dark, and while this mysterious court has that vibe and then some, there is also such glorious light and normalcy and elegance that reside in its spectrum. The Court of Nightmares gave me goosebumps. The Court of Dreams, however, gave me breath and life. The book centers in Velaris andohmygod this city! I loved Velaris with all my being and if there ever was a fictional place or universe in which I\'d want to live, then Velaris and the Night Court are it.Plotwise, there isn\'t really much to say, honestly, besides the fact that the king of Hybern is the new big bad wolf (as expected) and he wants to bring chaos into this world. But his presence is subtle, his threat only looming on the horizon -- the finale will deal with him more. Yet we encounter intrigue and secrets and eye-opening side stories and tales that create the legacy of Prythan hand in hand with the world-building. It felt similar toHeir of Fire, a journey of healing rather than grueling war. However, as in HoF, the last few chapters left me breathless and white-knuckled as I gripped the book to read every single word.Betrayals, alliances, resurrections, magic and evil marvelously unraveled in an explosive punch, a mic drop of a sort.It leaves you craving more the very next instant.We\'ll see more Nesta and Elain and Tam and Lucien in the next book, that\'s for sure. But the stakes are so high and the game of hide and seek between friends and enemies so dangerous that I cannot help but be in a continual frenzy until the sequel. It\'s going to be as much of a masterpiece as this one, certainly.A Court of Mist and Furymade me want to re-read it the second I\'ve finished it -- and re-read again afterwards. It made me want to live in its universe. It made me want to be friends with the characters, tell them how much I adore them and just how precious they all are. It made me feel alive in so many ways that it also rendered me speechless.But you know where its absolute beauty resides? It\'s in the cleverness with which it was constructed. Sarah J. Maas outdid herself -- with the loose threads, with the vibe ofHades & Persephoneand with the countless clues and hints that begged for a re-read of ACoTaR in order to pick them up bit by bit. No one can say she changed her creation to her whim, because it was all carefully planned out, mapped out ever since the first page of the first installment.“You are my salvation, Feyre.”A Court of Mist and Furyis my newfavorite bookand I\'ll keep it close to my heart from now on. Enchanting, clever and masterfully written, it shattered my expectations and raised itself on a gold pedestal. I love it completely and I hope you\'ll do so too -- as fiercely as Feyre loves the night.On a chirpier note though, I\'ll go drown myself into a hell of a long book-slump because nothing,absolutely nothing can come close to this glorious book while its remnants shine so brightly in my mind.ENJOY! <3P.S.:My headcanon fanart for ACoMaF:My Night Court photoset is a bit spoilery, so here\'s theTumblr link.My ACoMaF inspired playlist --The Stars Who ListenListen here:8tracks;YouTube.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'HOLY FUCKING SHIT. HOLY. FUCKING. SHIT.A COURT OF MIST AND FURY IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE.***CONTAINS A SHIT TON OF SPOILERS***REALLY, IF YOU HAVE NOT FINISHED THE BOOK YET, DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW.THIS BOOK IS WAAAAAAAY MORE THAN 5 STARS, IT\'S MORE LIKE 1000000000000000/5 STARS. I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE PERFECT BUT I DIDN\'T KNOW IT WAS GONNA BETHISPERFECT.To be completely honest with you guys, I have absolutely no idea where to start, so I\'m warning you, this is gonna be far from an actual review.May 3rd was the day I died.I ran to my mailbox, knowing what awaited me there. I opened it and saw the box, amazon prime tape all over it. I took it and ran back inside my house. I stared at the box and took a deep breath...THEN RIPPED THAT SHIT UP. I CLAWED AT IT, SHREDDING THE WHOLE FUCKING BOX IN THE PROCESS. I SAW THAT BLUE FUCKING COVER AND KNEW THAT MY LIFE WAS NEVER GONNA BE THE SAME. I TOOK THAT FUCKING BOOK AND TURNED THAT SHIT OVER. THE COVER WAS FUCKING BEAUTIFUL. SCREAMING LIKE I WAS BEING TORTURED IN THE DEEP PITS OF HELL, I RAN AND SAT MY ASS DOWN ON THE COUCH. I OPENED THAT SHIT UP AND READ TIL MY EYES BLED. DAMN STRAIGHT.So all I read in the first 40 pages or so was blah blah blah Tamlin blah blah blah Where\'s Rhys.And then the moment we\'ve been waiting for happened. The moment whereRHYSAND INTERRUPTS FEYRE\'S WEDDING TO BRING HER TO THE NIGHT COURT. FUCK YEAH.The Night Court is the most beautiful thing ever. Could it be any better? No. It was perfection. And when Rhys winnows with her there, Feyre\'s first instinct is to throw a shoe at him.THE ALL-POWERFUL, MOST FEARED HIGH LORD OF THE NIGHT COURT GOT HIT BY A SHOE.It was adorable.And Rhys helped teach Feyre how to read and it was the best thing ever. All the while training her on her new found powers. These powers came from the seven High Lords and Feyre has all of them.EVEN RHYS\'SFeyre became a very strong character in this book, Sarah knows how to work in that character development! She knew how to fight for herself and always wanted to be there to help in times of need. And the reason for leaving the Spring Court forever was because stupid Tamlin didn\'t let her go anywhere and practically made the estate Feyre\'s new prison cell. How symbolic. Remember that time Under the Mountain, Tamlin? When your ""beloved"" was trapped in that same cell for three whole months? How you didn\'t do anything about it and watched her rot? How on her last day Under the Mountain, you wanted to have sex with her instead of trying to free her? Ever think of those things Tamlin? Doesn\'t seem like it because now you\'ve recreated that same cell that\'s caused her so much trauma. Isn\'t he the greatest.When Feyre made the decision to stay at the Night Court with Rhys and the squad (who I adore so much by the way), I was so happy. Not just because that meant Rhys and Feyre time (whoo!), but because it showed how strong she\'s become and that she finally escaped the captivity of the Spring Court into the freedom of the Night Court. And she is a total bad ass.The Night Court squad is so awesome. We\'ve got Mor, Amren, Cassian, and Azriel who I love all equally. They all have character depth, flaws, and pasts that we learn about. Mor\'s past was devastating and made me want to just give her the biggest hug. I also enjoyed amren a lot because she looks like she could kill you and will actually kill you. And Azriel and Cassian are also really fun to read about as well. They are all cinnamon rolls.Let me just say, I love it when the girl saves the guy. In this case, it was Feyre saving Rhysand. They were flying and Rhys was hit in the back with ash arrows and was captured and whipped. Now Feyre, she wasMAD.She winnowed and killed the guys torturing Rhys like the total boss she is and saved Rhys from death. I was seriously so scared for my baby.NOW IS THE TIME TO BRING IT UP GUYS. THE MOMENT WE\'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR. WE WANTED IT TO HAPPEN FOR SO LONG. AND NOW IT\'S OUT IN THE OPEN. READY THE CANON.RHYSAND AND FEYRE ARE MATES.RHYSAND. AND. FEYRE. ARE. MATES.THE FANDOM RIGHT NOW.AND RHYS HAD DREAMS ABOUT FEYRE BEFORE HE EVEN MET HER. WHEN HE FIRST MET FEYRE HE HAD A SENSE THAT THEY WERE MATES. HE KNEW THE WHOLE TIME, AND IT BROUGHT MORE TEARS TO MY POOR EYES. IT ACTUALLY MAKES ME WANT TO REREAD A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES JUST TO HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW ON IT. AND RHYSAND REALIZED HE LOVED FEYRE WHEN HE HELD THE DAGGER TO AMARANTHRA\'S NECK.RHYSAND AND FEYRE ARE MATES AND EVERYTHING IS RIGHT IN THE WORLD.AND WHEN RHYS TOLD FEYRE EVERYTHING, (AND I MEAN EVERYTHING)...(LIKE REALLY EVERYTHING), I CRIED. IT WAS SOOOO.... I\'M SORRY I CAN\'T EVEN PUT IT INTO WORDS, BUT YOU PROBABLY FELT THE SAME THING. YOU KNOW.AND THE NIGHT OF STARFALL. OMG MY BABIES. THEY WERE AT THE BALCONY AND THEY WERE SHARING PERSONAL THINGS (I LIVE FOR THESE MOMENTS). AND THE ABSOLUTE MOST ADORABLE THING THAT HAPPENED WAS WHEN THEY BOTH WERE HIT IN THE FACE BY THE STARLIGHT AND LAUGHED. LAUGHED. AND SMILED SO MUCH. FEYRE HADN\'T SMILED LIKE THAT IN FOREVER. AND OH DEAR LORD SAVE ME, I\'M PICTURING THE GRIN RHYSAND GAVE FEYRE RIGHT NOW AND IT MAKES ME MEEEELLLLTTTT. I JUST SIMPLY CANNOT.Now, let\'s talk about the hottest scenes ever between my dear Rhys and Feyre.THEY WERE SO STEAMY AND I WAS FREAKING OUT THE WHOLE TIME. I DIDN\'T KNOW IF THIS WAS REAL LIFE OR NOT. AND THEY LASTED PAAAAAGGGGEESSS. A GLORIOUS AMOUNT OF PAGES. THESE WERE THE FELLOW STEAMY SCENES:COURT OF NIGHTMARES.THE CRAMPED BEDROOM.MATE REALIZATION. (THE BEST ONE)And Rhys is not who we expected him to be. He\'s sacrificed so much for his people like I can\'t even explain becauseHE SACRIFICED SO DAMN MUCH.And I seriously cried when he revealed all these things about himself.MAIN CAUSE OF MY EMOTIONAL TRAUMA RIGHT THERE.I could go on and on forever about the many many many precious Rhys and Feyre moments, but let\'s talk about that ending.Things were so perfect so far that I was getting scared. Scared that all that perfectness was going to be ripped away and I was going to be one emotional mess. And for a minute there, I was. You guys know what I\'m talking about.So Feyre and Rhysand acted like Feyre was under Rhysand\'s control the whole time so it made it seem like Feyre actually still loved Tamlin and that she wanted to go back with him. And then she wanted to make it seem more real. And I\'m like ""FEYRE IF YOU FUCKING TELL THE KING TO BREAK YOUR MATE BOND I SWEAR-"" And then she tells the king to break the mate bond. And Rhysand\'s screams just shattered my heart when he was about to. And shithead Tamlin\'s says ""Do it."".AND THE FUCKING KING OF HYBERN BROKE RHYS AND FEYRE\'S MATE BOND.I THOUGHT IT WAS OVER THEN AND THERE. I COMPLETELY LOST MY SHIT.BUT WAIT. IT\'S NOT OVER.RHYSAND AND FEYRE WERE ALSO ACTING THAT OUT TOO. THE MATE BOND WASN\'T BROKEN. I REPEAT, THE MATE BOND WAS NOT BROKEN. THE KING JUST BROKE THE BARGAIN WITHOUT REALIZING IT WASN\'T THE MATE BOND. THAT LOVE CANNOT BE BROKEN, ESPECIALLY RHYSAND AND FEYRE\'S. AND SO NOW THIS SETS UP THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD BOOK. FEYRE IS GOING TO SPY ON THE SPRING COURT AND SEND THE INFORMATION DOWN THE MATE BOND TO RHYS. YEAH FEYRE YOU GO GIRL.Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that Nesta and Elain were turned into High Fae. And Lucien is mated with Elain. Crazy, am I right?!AND FEYRE IS NOW HIGH LADY OF THE NIGHT COURT.I AM COMPLETELY SPEECHLESS AND AM STILL IN UTTER SHOCK AT HOW BEYOND AMAZINGLY PERFECT A COURT OF MIST AND FURY WAS. I CAN\'T EVEN PUT IT INTO WORDS. EVEN A GIF. I JUST-- WOW. YOU GUYS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I\'M FEELING RIGHT NOW. RHYSAND AND FEYRE ARE EVERYTHING I EVER WANTED.THE THIRD BOOK SHOULD BE CALLED ""A COURT OF PAIN AND EMOTIONAL TRAUMA"" BECAUSE THAT\'S HOW IT\'S PROBABLY GONNA GO. HERE COMES THE YEAR LONG WAIT. I DON\'T THINK I\'LL SURVIVE WITHOUT IT LONG ENOUGH. I WANT IT SOOOOO BADLY!!!!!AND I\'M MEETING FUCKING SARAH J. MASS ON THE 14TH AT THE CHICAGO BOOK CON TO GET MY COPY OF ACOMAF SIGNED AND MEET HER IN THE PROCESS! I\'LL MOST LIKELY BE RENDERED SPEECHLESS JUST LIKE AFTER I FINISHED ACOMAF. I AM SERIOUSLY SO EXCITED.I WILL SAY IT AGAIN: A COURT OF MIST AND FURY IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE.""To the stars who listen-- and the dreams that are answered.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Instagram||Threads||Facebook||Amazon||TikTokI almost tossed this down in disgust five times while reading this book. I knew, going in, that it was going to be a massive act of revisionism with regard to Rhysand, the villain of the first book. And as someone who loves villains and thePersephone myththat could have been something I could have gotten behind under the right circumstances. But I wasn\'ttrulyprepared for the narrative gymnastics that this book would perform to try to redeem him without really making him do any legwork. By the end of the book, he\'s still a sleaze lord, only now he\'s a sad sleaze lord in leather pants who was actually the heroine\'s soulmate all along and an all around Nice Guy. Pop a fedora on his head and he\'d probably ""milady"" his way through the Night Court.Big yikes.The beginning of the book was great, and very much in keeping with ACoTaR. Feyre has PTSD (understandable) and so does Tamlin (also understandable) and they\'re trying to heal and find the same love for each other that was the fuel for Feyre to save him under the mountain in the first place. The passion between them in the beginning was great. Feyre\'s misgivings about ruling also made sense. I could even understand why Tamlin would want to be so overprotective. He felt like he had betrayed her in failing to keep her safe and was overcompensating for it in the worst way by essentially treating her like she was made out of glass.Enter Rhysand, who makes good on his bargain to take Feyre back to his court for seven days a month. He actually ruins Feyre\'s wedding, where she is about to get married to Tamlin but having a major case of cold feet and PTSD. He tells her that her wedding dress is ugly and tells her that she should thank him for saving her the effort of breaking things off, because he is *chef\'s kiss* a prince among men. *eye roll* He takes it upon himself to teach Feyre to read and write and is so shocked that she was allowed to be illiterate for so long... which was kind of weird to me, because I was pretty sure that TAMLIN was actually teaching her how to read in book one?? Maybe I\'m wrong, but I seem to remember Tamlin teaching her to read was a major part of his introduction as love interest.Also, apparently Feyre hates painting now and is totally upset that Tamlin gives her a set of paints as a present. Because how dare he get her something that she used to like but didn\'t tell him that she doesn\'t like anymore. How dare he not be a mind-reader like Rhysand who is a prince among men.Anyway, things between Tamlin and Feyre aren\'t so great when she gets back. She starts noticing that he\'s really controlling but they never really sit down and talk about it. She whines about it but never discusses anything with him... and yes, while his behavior isn\'t great, locking her in the tower is hardly the abusive act that Feyre milked for all it was worth. It was bad, yes, but it\'s not like Rhysand was free of faults (oh no, we\'ll be getting to that), and yet his past was wiped so clean it was practically sparkling, while Tamlin\'s smaller crimes are portrayed as the Greatest Wrongs in the History of Wrongs, and you would think he put her up in some kind of prison camp for all that she goes on about Tamlin locking her up and Rhysand freeing her. IT WAS SO ANNOYING.The ""mate"" thing is really just a neat excuse to forgo any groveling while also explaining this seeming switch mid-series between love interests. We learn that Rhysand sexually assaulted Feyre for her own good, to keep her angry so she wouldn\'t give up hope. WOW, WHAT A GREAT GUY. About 370-pages in, he finally brings up the assault and sort-of-but-not-really-apologizes and Feyre merely shrugs it off, despite the fact that in book one, everything he did was infuriating and traumatizing to her, and she HATED his guts and HATED him for parading her around and objectifying her in front of Rhysand, drugged her, mind raped her, and even made jokes about forcing herself on her, but yeah, Tamlin\'s the bad guy because he locked her in her room ONE TIME.It\'s kind of amazing, really, how eager Feyre was to throw Tamlin in the trash.Also, like Celaena/Aelin in THRONE OF GLASS, it isn\'t enough for Feyre to be a bad-ass fighter on her own terms, no. When she comes back with the gifts of the other Lords, she comes back with LITERALLY ALL OF THEIR POWERS, and she is so powerful that people are going to kill her just to keep her powers from manifesting. Because a heroine just isn\'t worth salt if she isn\'t the Queen of the Specialverse, I guess. Part of what made Feyre so endearing in book one is because she actually did have to struggle to succeed; here, everything is served to her on a silver platter.I skipped over most of the Night Court things... they were so boring.Of course, Tamlin has to become a traitor. Maas basically did to him what she did to Chaol and Dorian in THRONE OF GLASS. They both become terribad people so Rowan can show up and steal the scene with his earth-shattering orgasms. I guess maybe even the author realized that Tamlin didn\'t look that bad, so making him into a betrayer was necessary for giving Feyre a clean-cut reason to dump his ass without looking petty. Also, apparently he harbors a sexual assaulter in his court, because in this book we learn that YET ANOTHER WOMAN IN THIS BOOK tried to have her way with Rhys without his consent, and Tamlin just keeps her around... because he\'s the bad guy now.We\'re supposed to feel sorry for Rhysand because he was Amarantha\'s ""whore,"" and yes, I do feel sorry for him... Amarantha was awful... but that doesn\'t excuse his own abuse. ""This is for your own good"" is literally one of the go-to phrases of abusers. He was AWFUL in A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES and he never really grovels for it. He tells Feyre abouthisabuses while crying, but that\'s all about HIM. He provides plenty of reasons-- excuses-- about why he did what he did, but this serves more to brush off his actions than genuine contrition. I wouldn\'t even care if he became her love interest as the villain if he was actually KEPT as a villain, but it\'s like all that brutality gets a pass because he is, in fact, a nice guy. Also, the casual story about what basically serves as an allegory to genital mutilation in his mother\'s court was super disturbing and mentioned like once, but holy yikes-- his parents were fucked up, and I felt like that should have been unpacked more.Lastly... the mental illness rep. Some people apparently think it\'s great. No. I don\'t think it is. Love basically cures Feyre\'s ills. While it\'s true that being in an unhealthy relationship can exacerbate existing mental illnesses and cause ones you are predisposed to to manifest, being in a good relationship is not a cure. You don\'t lose your PTSD or whatever because the sex is good and you\'ve found your soul mate. That is a toxic trope in way too many romances, and I can\'t stand for it. ALSO, what about Tamlin\'s PTSD? This was also never really discussed. Does only Feyre get to behave irrationally and have freak outs? That\'s an unrealistic expectation to have, and her contribution to that toxic relationship was never even discussed... because of course, Feyre is perfect.On second thought, maybe she is perfect for Rhysand. They\'re both selfish trash people.One of the crowning moments in this book is Feyre saying NOBODY HAS SUFFERED OR GONE HUNGRY LIKE I HAVE while a few chapters before she was hating on Tamlin for literally tithing his people until they starve. I guess she\'s the High Lady of Virtue Signalling as well. Fuck the poor people if they don\'t give her an excuse to hate on Tamlin. I don\'t believe they\'re mentioned again.If you forget how perfect this couple is, Feyre and Rhysand will remind you 2342342 times why the two of them are the Faerie Jesuses Incarnate who died and prostituted themselves for your sins.This almost reads like bad fanfiction of the first book. I really don\'t feel like Rhyand and Feyre were destined to be together from the beginning. I felt like maybe Maas initially planned on a love triangle but maybe thought Rhysand was too rough around the edges, and so worked double-time trying to find reasons to excuse all of his behavior and make him supes enamored with the heroine.The greatest death in this series wasn\'t Junian\'s or Amarantha\'s... it was Tamlin\'s character.It isn\'t even like Rhysand is perfect in this book. His flirting is literally saying things to Feyre that most men would get slapped for. He talks to her like one of those sexist asshats inMadmen. He\'s constantly talking about her appearance in a creepy way, and helaughswhen she\'s upset that he used her as bait for the Attor. Even their bargain, which ended up allowing him to read her mind, was done without consent, and he certainly doesn\'t ask for consent every time he reads her mind. At one point, he even says that he could rip her mind apart if he wanted. It\'s almost like this book was written out with the intention of having him still be the villain and Maas changed her mind halfway through.I really couldn\'t stand this book.Rhysand and Rowan are literally the same person, and their ""development"" with the heroine follows the same trajectory. It\'s not the worst book I\'ve read, and it\'s not even the worst Maas book I\'ve ever read, butI will never for the life of me understand why this series is so popular, or why some people who eagerly condemn other books for being problematic seem so eager to forgive or ignore the flaws in this one.Your mileage may vary.1 to 1.5 stars'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'When I finished this book,the mountains trembled.*Do I need to remind you to be civil? No, I don’t. Good kids.Thanks to my wonderful friendsEmer,ReyesandSarah(click to read their reviews) who helped me up this calvary, with whom I shared joys and sorrows, and who made me laugh so much I probably won\'t need to swing by the gym for the rest of my life.And a special mention goes toKaterina,NastassjaandVera(again, click and be delighted by snarkiness), who ranted with me in the comments of more than one update.Thank you. <3(I told you reading this book was so much fun.)---➤ The book, in brief:“Stop comparing.Stopcomparing me to him.”Because do you know what it is called when youkeepandkeepandkeepcomparing the previous love interest to the current one, and each single one of thesesugary,clichéd,obviousandtritecomparisons invariably leads to the conclusion that the ex is a prick while the newcomer is a Perfection Milkshake?No, Maas? I thought so.Oh well.I’m going to say this just once: it’s calledmanipulation.Now look at me, Maas. Do I look like a reader who enjoys being manipulated to you?No? Why,I thought so.To all those who still have to start this series and are intentioned to:don’t readA Court of Thornes and Roses. Spoil yourself a little of what happens there andstart with this one. Because -and this is the truly sad thing, as someone else said before me-A Court of Mist and Furycould even be enjoyable if the first book had not happened before.•I won’t go so far as to say that what we have here is a case of lack of “show” and an excess of “tell”, because the first chapters do show that Tamlin, whether for some PTSD or because he has always been a scumbag, undeniably acts like the worst man on the planet. I am even willing to forgive howcaricaturalhis behaviour appears. But, throughout the book, every occasion is a good occasion to throw in a comment tooverturncompletely also all the positive parts of him that are showed in the first book.(In this regard, I should say that inA Court of Thornes and RosesI did not care for Tamlin in any way, so I am not speaking out of frustrated adoration.)In this scenario, Tamlin is the epitome of all evil, while Rhys, of course, the epitome of all good: Tamlin cares for hierarchy, Rhys cares for family and nothing more (ugh); Tamlin wants her caged, Rhys want her free; as it turns out,it was Tamlin’s betrayal to begin the feud between his family and Rhys’s, and so on. I am not in any way saying that a man shouldn’t give freedom to his woman (it’s not that he should;he must, uncompromisingly), or that a plot-twist like the one I mentioned isn’t a good turn of events, even in terms of characterization, but everything is just sostereotypicalandtriteandsickly sweet.All of this,in the name of a ship. I think Maas should understand that falling out of love is just as normal as falling in. People fall out of love for normal reasons even if their exes don’t suddenly turn into maniacs.I am sick of this device, courtesy ofQueen of Shadows, and I don’t need the new love interest to be pushed on me: I am perfectly able to decide for myself.•I’ve seen some reviews in which these two characters are described as complex and multifaceted on the basis of their role reversal. Allow me to say that, in my opinion,nothing about them, in this book, is complex nor controversial.Maas did nothing more than switch their places and their personalities with them: Tamlin was the good one and turns out to be the villain; Rhysand was the villain (somehow, and indeed the Rhysand of the first book is the one I can honestly call intriguing) and now he is nothing short of a Fae Prince Charming.Simple as that.Besides,I liked Rhysandin this book, butI deeply missed the more wicked, morally grey part of himthat we saw Under the Mountain. He’s hot, sure, but he also comes off asflatand, at times,pathetic.•It was a dick moveto lock Feure up in the mansion, yes. And yet, I can’t wrap my mind around Feyre’s fickleness, considering thattwo chapter latershe says this:“I\'m thinking that I was a lonely, hopeless person, and I might have fallen in love with the first thing-thing? Now he’s a thing?-that showed me a hint of kindness and safety. And I\'m thinking maybe he knew that- maybe not actively, but maybe he wanted to be that person for someone. And maybe that worked for who I was before. Maybe it doesn\'t work for who- what I am now.""She hadevery rightto leave the mansion and let him stew for a while, but if that is the result of months and months of undying love, well. He stopped being worth of her love maybe, but I don’t think she fought for it that hard either, especially if he really was dealing with some PTSD. I think love is also about trying to fight for the other person even when they don’t seem to fight for us, to give them time, to give them chances, even though at one point we have to stop.It just would have been nicer and more enjoyable if Feyre’s affection’s shift hadn’t been so swift, that’s it.•All the contradictions. Feyre leave her abusive boyfriend, but then falls in the arms of a man who breaks every bone of a guy who called her names. Uh-uh. And if you say “He did that because he called her ‘whore’, and he’d been called whore too, and thetrauma”, I say: how do you know Tamlin’s behaviour wasn’t due to his trauma too. Maybe he just needed time. But it’s okay if it’s Rhysand that does that because epitome-of-perfection, remember?Hisbeing all possessive is okay. He can say things like “She’s mine” and snarl at people who so much as look at her. And don’t get me started on indecent exposure.•Thenew charactersare all nice and pretty and invariably haunted by a dark dark past. It’s nice to read about them and to witness their banters, but they don’t stand out as particularly well-written or sophisticated.•Theplotis evenweakerthan Maas’s usual. And contrary to what I usually do, I’ll sum it up for you: Feyre flees. TheMy Little Ponies gang- ops. I meant the Court of Dreams’ defenders (I know, the ponies were cooler) look for Things. Which do Stuff. Precisely, destroy Taran’s Black Cauldron and defeat The Horned King, minus the fluffy Gurgi.Well, wrong story, but that\'s basically what happens.In more than 600 pages.•People purr. Normal cats, thank God, ordinarily talk like freaking civilized beings.•The first timeRhysand and Feyre have sex and he climaxes, the mountains tremble. I refuse to comment on this thing, and if it was me who had written such embarrassing idiocy, I would be hiding my head under the sand. Moreover, allthe sex scenesare verycheesy,dramaticandover-written.•Lucien andElain’s mating bond. I swear on my heart I have never, ever read anything more ridiculous than this scene (oh, no, wait: the mountains). The passage from normal, rational person to mad caveman takes less time than a spark to burn. I almost expected he started hissing “My preciousss”.•And yet,I enjoyed it, or better, I enjoyedRhys,Rhys, his long, sappy, tearydeclaration/explanation(I have a thing for this trope; it could have been a thousand times worse than it actually is, and still I would\'ve loved it. I am such a softie, I know. My fault), theending, andRhys. The other things I pretty much despised. I also appreciate the fact that at least the author tried –and at some length, I think, even succeeded a tiny bit- to conceive a scenario in which Rhys’s cuddliness actually makes some sense.I still prefer him wicked.➽ To sum it up, what can I say? I read it with with ease because of an extremely fluent, even though not particularly sophisticated, writing style, and, as we all know, idiocies and mushy stuff can also be enjoyable, and truly, this book take the concept ofguilty pleasureto a whole new level. Nonetheless, I am sorry, but I can\'t overcome theirritationthat Maas\'s little games cause in me. She used the same lame and unprofessional trick twice now; my trust in her is gone, and I\'m wondering if we should expect a third time too.EDIT29/03/16: Ok, so I read the excerpt -as usual, unforgivably late, but this time the delay is due to the fact that I didn\'t know whether to read it or not. If you want to join the club, you can find ithere.What do I think of it? I simply think that making a protagonist goOOCwith three plain lines does take an inconceivable amount of talent. Because apparently the wholeQueen of Shadowsmess wasn\'t enough.Respect, Maas. Really.EDIT14/01/16:*braces herself for the incoming tomatoes*I don\'t like the cover!*runs away as fast as she can*'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'LET ME START MY REVIEW BY QUOTING MY PRE-REVIEW, THE ONE THAT I WROTE BEFORE THIS BOOK CAME OUT:Written in September 2015:Now that I\'ve read Queen of Shadows I don\'t know what to expect from this one. I AM SCARED. I\'m totally open to the whole Feyre/Rhys thing, but I love Tamlin so much and I don\'t want him to be ruined by Sarah J. Maas! Can someone please tell her that she can make us love a character without ruining another character?Because really, I ship Feyre and Tamlin, but I will not be mad if SJM handles Rhys\'s and Feyre\'s relationship with cleverness.PLEASE SJM, DON\'T RUIN TAMLIN....And of course, WHAT DID SJM DO? RUIN TAMLIN!I tried to write my review without major plot spoilers, but there will be some minor spoilers about how the characters were handled. And warning: my emotions over this book are a mess, you\'ll se how contrary they are!Anyway... let me begin:OH, I was mad! I was so angry when I started reading this book, because it is in the first chapter that you notice that Tamlin has changed and not for good. Now he\'s an asshole. He\'s insensitive and controlling, I couldn\'t stand him! So congrats, SJM, you made me despise my (now former) favorite character in this series.I read a few reviews that said that Tamlin was always like that (a possessive piece of shit), but NO. HE WASN\'T! He was caring and protective, not a control freak. I feel that Tamlin changed because of everything that happened with Amarantha. Everyone comments on how Feyre had PTSD and Tamlin didn\'t try to understand her, but I think Tamlin also had PTSD. What he went through with Amarantha (and with almost losing Feyre) had a huge toll in him. I can accept that he changed because of that, but no one acknowledges it, not the readers, not Feyre, not even SJM.So that must mean that he just changed because he\'s an asshole (I\'m not buying it).My problem is that SJM wanted to force Rhysand on us, like she wanted to force Rowan on us in her Throne of Glass series. Excuse me, miss, but I don\'t need the love interest to be pushed on me. I can decide by myself. And the thing is... I FELL IN LOVE WITH RHYS IN THIS BOOK! And I think I would\'ve fallen for him even if Tamlin hadn\'t been the piece of shit he was.Before this book, I couldn\'t imagine any possible reason that would make Feyre leave Tamlin and fall for Rhys. Not after everything she went through to save Tam, he was the love of her life and her feelings for him were genuine. But then of course, the author put a lot of effort in ruining Tamlin, just so Feyre could fall out of love. What SJM doesn\'t seem to understand is that falling out of love is normal. It\'s perfectly fine. You don\'t have to turn a character into a bad guy for that to happen. Sarah turned Tam into a villain, and that was not necessary.I also hated the comparisons Feyre was always making between Rhys and Tam, so frustrating! They were so obviously put there only to make sure that the reader understood that Tamlin was evil and Rhysand was good:-""Ugh, Tamlin doesn\'t let me go anywhere. But Rhys lets me do anything I want!""-""Ugh, I had my nightmares and Tamlin never woke up to confort me. But Rhys is always there for me when that happens!""-""Ugh, Tamlin only cares about hierarchy. But Rhys cares about family and about his people!""-""Ugh, Tamlin doesn\'t let me enter to his room. But of course Rhys invites me to his!""...I MEAN, SERIOUSLY? We can notice that by ourselves, but Feyre kept comparing and comparing during the whole book.Have you read the Shatter Me series? It was as if Feyre was Juliette, Tamlin was Adam and Rhysand was Warner... the very same pattern! First Tamlin was a cinnamon roll and suddenly he becomes a bad guy who only thinks about himself and is obsessed with Feyre. And Rhys was the evil guy in the first book but then you discover that he had really good reasons to do everything he did, and he\'s a good guy incapable of commiting any evil. Gosh, I really liked Tamlin, but now I simply can\'t stand him. SJM succeeded!And I had other issues with this book... but that was my main one. I\'m afraid this has become the modus-operandi of SJM.Let me talk about those other issues... starting with Rhys. His character really intrigued me in the first installment of this series, he seemed evil, and I knew there was more in him than what he let us see. I knew he had his reasons to act the way he did, and of course I wanted to know why. BUT THIS WAS JUST RIDICULOUS. He\'s not justnot evil, he istoogood, bordering in perfection. He\'s a saint, he\'s ""Saint Rhys"". There is too much goodness in him. He\'s also the ""most powerful Fae ever born"", see? It\'s unnatural to be that perfect.Another issue was that Rhys seems to be the only High Lord that cares about peace and prosperity. He\'s literally the only one trying to stop the King. The other High Lords don\'t care about humans! The other High Lords are stupid! I feel like SJM did this just to add more perfection to Rhysand\'s character: Obviously he\'s the only considerate Fae that cares about the poor humans, the other High Lords are nothing compared to him!Now let\'s go to the other side of my review (this will be drastic): Despite eveything, I LOVE RHYS SO MUCH! UGH, SARAH! You did it, you made me fall in love with him! Maybe it\'s his good nature. Maybe it\'s his perfection. Maybe it\'s because he reminds me of Warner. I don\'t care anymore... I\'m just really rooting for him. I don\'t know how Sarah does it. Even with everything that bothers me about his character, I couldn\'t help falling for him.And it is rare when I change my ship in a series, but I did in this one because there\'s no way I\'d still ship Feyre and Tamlin after everything that happened in this book (which is sad, because I really shipped them in the first book). Now I can only say that I ship Feyre and Rhys SO. MUCH. Their relationship development was beautiful, everything they went through made their love more real, made it stronger. There is no love triangle here, there are no teams, there are simply Feyre and Rhys and I NEED them to be together.There were only two things I didn\'t like about their relationship. 1)The whole: I DREAMT ABOUT YOU BEFORE I MET YOU....Cliché, cliché, cliché. 2) The ""YOU ARE MINE"" parts. I mean, Feyre left Tamlin because he was possesive and controlling, but all those ""you are mine"" are not exactly different, right? I don\'t like that kind of love. It should not be about belonging to someone, it should be about belonging together.I also love Cassian and Azriel. Everything that happened at the end with them made me a sobbing mess! I just hope Cassian recovershis poor wings!, because if not, I\'ll just go to a corner and cry forever.Now let\'s talk about Feyre. Sometimes she infuriated me because of all the comparisons she made and because she was always complaining about Tamlin not trying to understand her, but she didn\'t really try to understand him, either. Sometimes she was really unfair with himExcept when he locked her up, I would\'ve done the same thing Feyre did. AND NO, I don\'t want them back together (NEVER), it\'s just that she made me really mad sometimes. But in contrast, I think she really grew as a character in this book, she blew me away! The scene with the water wolves was AMAZING. AlsoI cried when the evil creatures attacked Velaris! Ugh, stupid queens!!!...I couldn\'t stand it, it was painful to read. But back to Feyre, I like the directon her character is going.I can\'t wait to read the next installment! I know Tamlin doesn\'t have a chance of forgiveness (I myself can\'t ever forgive him), but I\'d like to see redemption in Lucien, he\'s a character with great potential and in this book he was just too weak.The world building was great, a total A+! I\'m still a little confused about the whole Jurian ordeal, but I hope he gets killed soon :). All in all, this book was GREAT, I think that maybe it was better than the first one, and that\'s saying a lot, because I loved ACOTAR. But since I had way too much issues with it, I could not give it 5 stars. I don\'t know how Sarah does it... she makes me love her and hate her in every book she writes! But it\'s more love than hate, I am SJM trash. She\'s QUEEN.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""I've never been thismanipulatedin my life.I was stripped off my free will until there was only a shell left behind, a puppet complying with her master's whim. This is the most vulgar thingSarah J. Maascould do.Allow me to elaborate.•In order to be candid, I have to admit thatI enjoyedA Court of Mist and Furymore than I expected, and found some redeeming traits that prevented me from rating it lower. However, I can't hide my rage and utter disappointment sinceeverything we read inA Court of Thorns and Rosesvanished into thin air. Remember the sweet love story between Tamlin and Feyre that defied immortal tyrants and resulted in great sacrifices in the name of their love? Well, forget about it. We were warned that this would be aHades and Persephone retelling, meaning the romantic relationship between Feyre and Rhysand would be inevitable. The way, though, Sarah handled the transition wasfeebleandinfuriatingto say the least. I don't think there has ever been a character moremistreatedthan Tamlin, with Lucien following suit. We get it, Sarah cares about her precious baby Rhysand, but her real talent as an author would be to make me choose him because I found something unique in him,not because she forced him down my throat. Tamlin's inexcusable behaviour suffocated Feyre, and I felt drowning and suffocating along with her. Since I couldn't possibly wish for her to stay in a mentally abusive relationship, Rhysand was the deus ex machina, the only one to save the damsel in distress, given that her friends abandoned her and her fiance suffered from split personality. Sarah dangled Rhysand in front of me, and every reader, sayingpick him pick him pick him. She had Tamlin and Rhysand facingidenticalsituations, only for Tamlin to do the wrong thing while precious Rhysand was the impersonation of right, of all that's good in the world. Tamlin locked Feyre? Rhysand set her free. Tamlin forbid Feyre from participating in his activities? Rhysand would always have her by his side. Tamlin extinguished the fire burning in Feyre and left her a hollow version of herself? Rhysand fueled that fire, and so on, so on. Now, I've been on the losing side of a triangle before, but always both love interests had some good qualities. In this case, though, Sarah served you the answer on a silver platter by annihilating the opponent and erasing everything that made the relationship between Feyre and Tamlin good and healthy. Rhysand was always sothoughtfulandconsiderateand knew what Feyre needed, he was her salvation. Of course he was, there was afreaking magic bondbetween them that allowed him to read her thoughts. Even the lesser fae servant in the Day Court would understand her needs if they were bonded. In every chapter she would chantRhysand is so gorgeous,Rhysand is so sexy,Rhysand is the most powerful High Lord in the history of Prythianyada yada.We.Get.It.Don't even get me started on the repetition of the wordmate, I rolled my eyes so many times I fear I might have a permanent problem.•Lucien losing his backbone and Tamlin turning into a psycopath a-hole were not the only character mistreatments, though.Rhysand was the victim of his own creator's adoration.In order to make him the perfect match for Feyre, she made himtoo perfect. Gone is the wicked, morally grey, complex character that intrigued us inA Court of Thorns and Roses. While unveilingthisRhysand, instead of finding shadows and darkness and lust for power, we found asappyand fluffy bear asking for love and affection. Everything he did was out oflovefor his friends, for Feyre and his country, and I fail to accept his reasoning behind his actions Under the Mountain. If you don't want the villain to know how you feel about Feyre, you can simply ignore her. But no, why not drug her, grop her while drugged and humiliate her instead?•Now let's get to the relationship between Feyre and Rhysand. For more than the first half of the book I liked them, with their banters and flirtation and the pent-up tension. But from attraction and friendship Feyre suddenly jumped to declarations of love and thenmountains trembledand she startedglowingand their sex scenes varied between steamy to cringe-worthy and more eye-rolling ensued (I seriously need to see an ophthalmologist).•Plotwise, I can't help but notice that some things were veryconvenient. You suspect the King of Hybern is preparing for war? Let's ask the monstrous ancient creature, who in the span of five minutes will give us all the answers, including the means to defeat the King and the exact location of the weapons to nullify his powers. Wanna convince the mortal queens to give you what you need? Write a mushy letter about your love for Feyre. The result is guaranteed. I mean, really?•Why three stars then, you may wonder. Well,I became very fond of the secondary characters. Mor, Azriel, Cassian and the ultimate Queen, Amren, were funny and caring and loyal, and I was actually more invested in their stories (which, to be honest, were all sob stories). I also enjoyed Sarah'slush descriptions, you could feel and breathe and walk the streets of Velaris, and the Summer Court. But most importantly, I admire the way Feyre's trauma from her experiences Under the Mountain was depicted. The guilt, the sorrow, the self-loathing were tangible, and the healing was slow and realistic. Her wounds would be there, and she learned to live with them. Feyre became a strong woman who embraced her gifts, her powers, her sensuality and ferociously claimed her place alongside men. She rose from her ashes.“When you spend so long trapped in darkness, you find that the darkness begins to stare back.”•A Court of Mist and Furyhad great potential, but I can't say I loved it. I'm partially sad because I lost some of my respect for Sarah, for shredding to pieces the characters I loved only to show her own favorites are better. I don't know whether I'll readA Court of Wings and Ruin. Before the last chapters it was a big no, but that final confrontation was the book's highlight for me and now I'm considering to dwelve into the third instalment to find out the end of this story-arc.To all my friends who loved this book, and I know there are many of you, please don't be harsh on me. The magic of reading is precisely the fact that we all read the same book but get something different from it. ❤️You can findthis reviewand more over atBookNest.eu!""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Let's pretend this is Starfall and I have more than 5 ⭐ to giveThis book’s song mood match –Nocturnal by Elle VeeFull review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolf🐺“To the stars who listen – and the dreams that are answered.”How dares Sarah J. Maas??How dare you, lady?? How dare you destroy me like that and then drink cups full of my salty tears like they are fine wine?? What kind of fucked up sadistic witchy ritual is this for you?You annihilate me with your cruel imagination. And because I’m a masochist, I love it. Keep going queen, I love this kind of pain.So, I couldn’t have picked a better time to read this but the quarantine time; all I did all day was reading this; I was being transported to this amazing world that I want to be part of right now – the Night Court is my eternal home from now on.“Stay here for however long you want. Stay here forever, if you feel like it.”It helped my mental health so much I am at a lack of words to express my gratitude.When I was younger, I used to read a lot of mythological stories and even though the Greek mythology confused the hell out of me, I had this fascination for some badass ladies. Amongst them were Persephone and her story. Yes, my cheesy heart loved that, okay?Persephone was the Bride of Spring, but she was stolen by the God of the Underworld – the terrible Hades – because he was head-over-heels in love with her. But she hated him with all her being until…she didn’t anymore. She learned to love his weird-ass too until he became her husband.If this isn’t the literary world’s foundation for their enemies-to-lovers theme, then I don’t know what this is, I give up.Well, this is the exact thing that happens inA Court of Mist and Fury. Rhys gets to be Hades (duh, obvy!) and Feyre is our darling Persephone. My brain started producing serotonin once again because of that tiny little fact some now happy beyond compare.This book is a love statement. Falling in love – slowly, truly, deeply, madly in love. And hard. But heart-crying beautiful. And it is not only about two beautiful creatures learning how to love each other and all the states they get through to find that love.This book teaches of how to fall in love with beautiful people, beautiful faces, beautiful minds and beautiful souls. And most importantly, how to fall in love with yourself. How to cherish everything you get to have in order to know how to soothe your life and spirit.“But then she snapped your neck.”Tears rolled down his face.“And I felt you die”, he whispered.Tears were sliding down my own cheeks.“And this beautiful, wonderful thing that had come into my life, this gift from the Cauldron…It was gone.”Don’t get confused though. This is still a Maas work of art and thus it is still very, very extremely hot. I can’t manage to launch into an explanation of how hot this book is because it is on fire, okay? And with this, SJM makes out of this book a full emotional experience (an emotional roller coaster better said but oh well).All of my favourite characters from this series make an appearance in this book. If you thought you loved the characters you encountered in the first book, then wait to be blown away by the apparition of the Inner Circle. They’re precious, deadly soft babies that I would want nothing more in life for them but to be fed, warm, cuddled and loved.-Cassianis the ruffian of my heart, he’s big and loud and gives off this feeling that he’ll keep you happy and safe no matter what; just love him so much;-Azrielis the baby-bat-guardian-angel of my soul whom I love so much and all I want to do in life is hug him and feed him and protect him from everything and everyone;-Amrenis a scary old bitch whom I love for the simple fact that she doesn’t seem to give a fuck about anyone but she’ll be ready to defend her friends if it comes to it;-Moris my girl-crush of this series and sometimes I think she’ll be my ultimate wine-drinking bestie; I love her to death;“A queen – a queen who bowed to no one, a queen who had faced them all down and triumphed. A queen who owned her body, her life, her destiny and never apologized for it.”All those weirdos are like a big, fat present for me, wrapped up in colourful paper and with a bow tied on top. I don’t know how I managed to go on with my life before I learned about their existence.Now, moving on to more serious, adult-like topics, I want to confess one thing: this book is extremely sensual. It really goes places and I went with it like in trance. The level of sexiness explored here is so intense that it could be made a masterpiece of sensually falling in love. And this is mainly because ofRhys.In this book, I honestly cared more about Rhys than I cared about all of the characters inA Court of Thorns and Roses. He is the sexiest thing I’ve ever encountered in my life and with this, I have discovered, he’s my type of man, no questions asked.“I have known many High Lords. Cruel ones, cunning ones, weak ones, powerful ones. But never one that dreamed. Not as he does.”It feels like he’s having his own personalised gravitational system and we simply happen to fly around like thebăgători-de-seamăthat we are, if I’m allowed to express myself as Romanian as possible.Rhysand and Feyre's falling in love journey is one of the most beautiful love stories this world could read about. It is so warm, but also so crushing. I love it. It’s like a most beautifully painted love dream.By the end ofthis– *vaguely gesturing towards everything ACOMAF is*– I felt tired, hurt and blurry-sighted. And truth be said, a bitsobby(a bit more). I’ve been hurt to my core.But I loved this book so much, honestly. And I’m thankful for the fact that it exists for me to read it.“We were a song that had been sung from the very first ember of light in the world.”""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '❝I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal.

Tamed.❞A Court of Thorns and Roses was one of the first books I started reading that got me into Fantasy and reviewing books. Way back when this series, the Throne of Glass series, and Sarah J. Maas, herself, wasn\'t hyped up like there\'s no tomorrow. It was the first book I\'ve read by Sarah J. Maas and the reason I picked up the Throne of Glass series because I just needed more SJM in my life.I was satisfied with the way things ended in ACOTAR so when I heard that some ""changes"" were going to be made in A Court of Mist and Fury, I was a little disappointed. I was NOT a fan of the changes that were made in the Throne of Glass series which was why I haven\'t picked up Queen of Shadows yet even though the book has been sitting on my shelf since the day it\'s been released. That\'s just my opinion. I know some SJM fans are going to start pouncing because they sincerely believe that Sarah could absolutely do no wrong. Don\'t get me wrong, I LOVE SARAH J. MAAS. She is an outstanding author. I love her writing, her characters, and the world that she brings to life. It was her books that changed my perspective on Young Adult Fantasy, but I honestly wouldn\'t say that I agree with every direction that SJM takes with her books.I suppose the questions to ask now are: what was my stance at the end of ACOTAR and how did I perceive the changes that were made after reading ACOMAF?Let me address the most important aspect of Sarah J. Maas\'s books, this series, and probably the thing that majority of readers care about the most: THE ROMANCE. Since A Court of Thorns and Roses was a loose retelling of Beauty and the Beast, my ship of course was none other than Tamlin and Feyre. I loved them as individuals and I loved them even more as a couple. AND I loved Rhysand. Just not as a love interest. I felt like Feyre wasn\'t worthy of the enigma that was Rhysand. But knowing the trend that SJM follows in all of her books, I figured a change in love interests was inevitable. After all, a book isn\'t written by Sarah J. Maas if there isn\'t some character butchering and changes in love interests involved.But after reading A Court of Mist and Fury, I actually found myself accepting the transition in love interests much to my surprise. As much as I wanted Tamlin and Feyre to stay together, I knew it wasn\'t going to happen. These two people that survived weren\'t the same people that were Under the Mountain. They\'re relationship became such a nightmare and so unhealthy. It was two damaged lovers waiting for a disaster to happen.In the beginning of this series, I understood where Tamlin was coming from and why he was so protective of Feyre. It was for Feyre\'s own good and nobody wants to lose the people they love and/or care about. But he took it way too far. He became too overbearing to the point where he was holding Feyre back. We all understood the trials and suffering that Feyre had to go through but I feel like people don\'t acknowledge what Tamlin had to go through as well while they were Under the Mountain. It was nothing close to what Feyre had to go through but Tamlin had to watch the person he loved suffer and die. He couldn\'t protect her the way he wanted and he didn\'t fight for her as he knew he very well could have. He was helpless and a coward. I think he realized this, which was why he tried to make up for it afterwards by protecting her now to the point where she\'s being suffocated. It still doesn\'t excuse what Tamlin does in this book but he\'s just another damaged character like Feyre and Rhysand. He\'s just hurting in different ways and expressing that pain in a way the he views would make up for his shortcomings in the first book. Tamlin loves Feyre, that much is evident. He just loves her too much, and that is the tragedy.As for Rhysand, all I can say is that I loved him in ACOTAR and I loved him even more in A Court of Mist and Fury. I loved that we finally get a good understanding of Rhys as a character, the secrets he\'s kept, and the sacrifices he\'s made for the good of his people and his court. He was everything that Tamlin was not and twice the man and High Lord that Tamlin will ever be. I\'m not completely sure if I\'m 100% on board with Feyre and Rhysand yet but I love their chemistry, friendship, and the way they just understand and respect one another. I think I would\'ve been head over heels in love with Feyre and Rhys instantly as a couple if ACOTAR never happened and I didn\'t get so attached to Feyre and Tamlin. But I no longer ship Tamlin/Feyre and I\'m slowly, but surely, beginning to fall in love with Rhysand and Feyre little by little.With romance aside, everything about A Court of Mist and Fury turned out every bit as great as I anticipated a year ago. Sarah J. Maas did not disappoint. I was preparing myself for the worst but instead I got the best. Sarah really knows how to capture her audience with her writing, worldbuilding, and characters that she has created. Of all the new things that were introduced in this book, the new characters of the Night Court were definitely my favorite. I thought the Spring Court was great in ACOTAR with characters like Lucien and Alis but the Night Court was at a whole new level with Cassian, Azriel, Morrigan, and Amren. BADASS is literally an understatement describing these new characters.Besides Rhysand and Feyre, ACOMAF introduced so many new ships and I can\'t handle all the perfectness that everyone is. I now ship Mor and Azriel with all of my being, just putting it out there. XD And Cassian and Nesta. And Lucian and Elain. None for you Tamlin.Overall, I was glad I waited to read A Court of Mist and Fury because as a result, I was able to dive into the story with an open mind about the changes that were going to be made in terms of romance and the direction that Sarah J. Maas was taking the series. Love her or hate her, Sarah can write one hell of a story and is such an outstanding author. Although there were some parts of the book that went by a little slow, I think A Court of Mist and Fury was even better than ACOTAR in more ways than one. Sometimes I find that sequels may suffer ""middle book syndrome"" but ACOMAF amplifies that momentum knowing that Sarah is preparing to hurtle anticipation and suffering our way for the conclusion of the A Court of Thorns and Roses trilogy.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal.I was a survivor, and I was strong.Oh damn. That was so unexpectedly good. And to think I almost didn\'t take a chance on this after not loving the first book...So, here it is: I present to you7 reasons why this book is a million times better thanA Court of Thorns and Roses.1) Less romance.Oh, don\'t worry, there\'s romance. There\'slusty, slow-build, flirtatious romancethat somehow manages to be completely absent from the first book, even though romance was more central to the plot. But there\'s also so many other things here. It\'s a fantasy with romantic elements, not the other way around.I always say I tend to become more invested in love stories when they\'re subplots and the book itself is not actuallyaboutthe love story. I like it when the characters come together around and between all the rest of the action and drama. That\'s what\'s happening here. Because there is a whole shitstorm of other things going on - which, by the way, has led tobetter world-building, more exciting action and reveals, and a fascinating overarching story.2) Feyre\'s growth and development.And, in fact, the growth and development of many characters. Maas spends some quality time on character histories and backstory to strengthen our understanding of them. I absolutely love it when characters show realistic growth over time and I think that\'s especially important with Feyre here.Feyre is not the character she was duringA Court of Thorns and Roses. How could she be after the events of that book? Naturally, she has changed and found that her needs and aspirations have changed too. Once upon a time, back when she was weak and starving, she longed for a strong protector like Tamlin. Now she is strong, and she needs freedom to train her newfound strengths.3) I hate Tamlin.Honestly, if you happen to be a diehard Tamlin fan, I can see this book being a huge disappointment. Luckily for me, I pretty much despised him. He\'s never been anything but apretty-faced control freak. I\'m glad Feyre has seen that and rebelled against it.I should warn you that Tamlin is absent for about 70-80% of this book. And that was just fine by me!4) I love Rhysand.I foresee the ""oh no, it\'s a love triangle"" comments rolling in, but I really don\'t think it is. I actually think this is a great book aboutgrowing up and discovering that you\'re a different personwho longs for different things. I don\'t get the sense that Maas is trying to play out the Tamlin/Feyre/Rhysand angst; she is merely showing a young woman having a change of heart.AND can we just talk about how much better Rhysand is. There\'s all the superficial stuff like he\'sexciting, flirty, dangerousand I love the story behind him. He\'s more fun than Tamlin and I like fun. His banter is wonderful. But I\'m also talking about a more important level. Rhysand is, despite being the ""bad boy"", thoughtful and selfless. He doesn\'t want to stifle Feyre\'s strength and lock her away for her own protection - he wants her at his side, an equal, a partner in crime. And I love that so much.I like men who see value in strong women.5) Less sexual.I\'m sorry, you horny readers, but I just need to put this out there:I really dislike Maas\' sex scenes. Maybe Tamlin had something to do with it but, in general, I think they\'re overwritten and melodramatic. I also think she does a lot of ""telling"" you that it\'s hot, instead of ""showing"" how it is, which is a common writing mistake, but is far worse when in a sex scene. It\'s unconvincing.And by ""overwritten"", I mean that she describes kissing as ""branding"", thrusts as ""breaking"", and sex moans as ""prayers"". Literally none of those things are sexy. She gets the flirtations and banter right - that bit is hotter than the actual sex - but I start to cringe when the clothes come off.A brush of his tongue against the seam of my lips had me opening fully for him, and he swept in, claiming me, branding me.Also, is it really necessary for the male characters to ""growl in approval"" during sex? Not just once - and arguably one growl is one too many - but several times. I\'m supposed to be fanning myself with desire and all I can think about isRoy Orbison\'s Pretty Woman.Mercy. Rawr.6) New characters.A Court of Mist and Furyintroduces many new characters, and the difference between this book and the first is that I found them all memorable, not just the main three characters. Maas has definitely not neglected her characterization and character detailing here. Everyone who comes in and out of the novel has an important purpose, is fleshed out with personality and history, and makes an impact.My favourite was Amren, but I also loved Cassian and Azriel. Our brief introductions to the Bone Carver and the Weaver were highlights too.7) The ending.Take note: this is how to ensure your reader needs to get their hands on the next book. It\'s not a cliffhanger, but it is still EVIL. In the best possible way. I loved everything about it. It\'s the kind of emotional high that leaves you somewhere between wide-eyed horror and smiling gleefully.How will I last a whole year?Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube|Store'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Well, well, well. How the turns have tabled.ACOTAR was, uh...not my favorite book in the world.But there are no words to describe how much better ACOMAF is.All the problems I had with the first book were fixed. The story got bigger and more epic. The romance improved dramatically. And I fell in love with all the characters.This review has spoilers for the first book. Spoilers for ACOMAF will be boxed off with siren emojis (🚨).After the events Under the Mountain, Feyre is understandably traumatized. She saved Tamlin and the Spring Court at the cost of her own mental health. She had to kill innocent Fae to save him. And now she can\'t look at the color red without getting flashbacks. She wakes up every night to throw up.And Tamlin isn\'t helping.He\'s extremely protective of her after Amarantha killed her, even though Feyre was brought back stronger than ever as a High Fae. He doesn\'t allow her to talk to her family or to leave Spring Court land. He goes as far as to lock her in the house so she won\'t try to help the recovery effort in Prythian.And that\'s when she breaks. She calls out for anyone to save her, and Rhysand hears her through the bond, taking her to the Night Court to ride out the storm. But along the way, she realizes that she is more than a figurehead. She has powers, given to her by the High Lords when her body was remade. This book is essentially Feyre\'s journey to finding and accepting herself with Rhysand\'s help.Rhysand, High Lord of the Night Court, is not as he seems. In ACOTAR, we saw the facade he put on so Amarantha didn\'t get suspicious. But the real Rhys is a haunted, traumatized character who hates himself and feels worthless. He\'s exactly like Feyre. An excuse for Rhysand\'s past behavior is given, and it actually makes sense.Their journey to discovering themselves is beautiful, touching, and heartbreaking. And while I do hate Tamlin for being so heartless to Feyre, I can see where he\'s coming from and I don\'t think we should treat him like a villain.He\'s protective of Feyre because he saw her die, and he\'s absolutely terrified of that happening again. So he protects her the only way he knows how--by shutting her inside and not letting anyone see her. And it drives Feyre mad. I think there should have been a Tamlin redemption arc, and I really want to see Tamlin recovering from his PTSD as well. Because they\'re both suffering and they both deserve help. I don\'t want Tamlin to become the villain.However, the signs of emotional abuse and possible physical abuse are clearly evident.- Claws come out whenever Feyre confronts him- Makes her PTSD worse by locking her inside, giving her flashbacks to Under the Mountain- Doesn\'t take her opinions seriously- Doesn\'t listen to her, or kisses her or something to make her shut up- Gives her no responsibilitiesThe mental health rep was outstanding. Tamlin\'s rep was kind of harmful, but Feyre\'s was so raw and emotional and real.She didn\'t recover from her trauma because of love.She recovered because of friendship, and because people actually listened to her and took her seriously. Love was just a side effect.It\'s really the little things that helped. Feyre comforting Rhys during his nightmares and realizing that they were alike. Mor wearing blue instead of her favorite color (red) when she first meets Feyre. The Court of Dreams giving Feyre time to recover when she has a panic attack.The one thing I think this book needs is more diversity. Everyone was white except for this one guy that showed up for two chapters. The caucacity.🚨🚨🚨SPOILERS AHEAD🚨🚨🚨I did not like Rhysand\'s character after Feyre discovered the mating bond.This may have something to do with the fact that I don\'t like the idea of ""mates."" They\'re essentially soulmates, if you\'re not familiar with SJM. I always felt uncomfortable with the overprotectiveness that comes with the term and the kind of animalistic ring to the word itself.I actually really, really loved Rhys\'s character before he and Feyre were mates. He was so suave and intelligent and witty. That is, until the mating bond snapped into place. And then he was insanely overprotective and I just don\'t like that in a character.🚨🚨🚨SPOILERS HAVE ENDED🚨🚨🚨Another rap, because why not.

There\'s too much that happened and (whew) I am just wholly overwhelmed with everything.We last left Feyra as abroken shell of a girl- she survived trials and the hardships but her mind wasn\'t the same. Tamlin deals with this through acuddle and coddlemethod but her fears won\'t go away.Then, on the day of her wedding -someone saves herand despite her vehement disapproval - she realizes that she\'s in need of rescuing.He thinks he\'ll be remembered as the villain in the story. But I forgot to tell him that the villain is usually the person who locks up the maiden and throws away the key. He was the one who let me out.I love how Sarah J.

He\'s such adelightful gossiperthat I\'m desperately hoping for a reappearance in the third book.Orthe Weaver- such a mind-blowingly creepy character - who will (undoubtedly) be long-standing in my memory.

I just want to fill this review up with the heart-eye emojis.Minor spoilers will be included. You've been warned.This book is incredible. This book is important. But before I get to that, this book was a massive, gigantic improvement on ACOTAR. They're not even the same two books. Or they are, but ACOMAF elevated this series to what it deserved and needed to be.The world was epic, detailed and grand and I never wanted to leave. Everything about it clicked. I was absolutely transported into a world that I became obsessed and enthralled with. The pacing was beautifully slow, but well paced and the build up was great.So, the story line picks up right where it left off, with Feyre and Tamlin being back in the Spring Court, and now having to suffer from PTSD and anxiety. I absolutely love how SJM explored this and showcased how they were both affected by what happened in the events of the last book.Now, I was afraid that Tamlin's character was going to be completely bashed and written off since readers were hating on him and since I really liked his character in ACOTAR, that had me worried. But as I read on, the progression with his character made sense. As much as I loathed how he became, it's understandable and true to real life. His PTSD took on a different form. Sadly, that form became more emotionally abusive, manipulative and controlling. It was almost unbearable to even read. It was ugly but it needed to be there.Feyre just lost herself. She didn't know who she was anymore. Her trauma unfolded in a way that changed her completely and led her to who she truly needed to become.I absolutely loved how SJM incorporated those aspects into the story and how Feyre grew and continued to beautifully grow throughout the book. Facing setbacks, but ultimately, finding herself and her voice again. That 'human' element made it so relatable and warm. And the depth that SJM went into for both characters was impressive and you couldn't help but be invested and feel a strong sense of empathy.But what I loved more than anything was that SJM showed what a healthy and unhealthy relationship is. What to stand and not to stand for, depending on the standards you've set for yourself and which ultimately, you decide for yourself. 'Twas fuckin feminist as fuck, whilst also incorporating what true friendship and a healthy and loving relationship can do for your worth. To ultimately put your wellbeing ahead of everything so you may recognise the signs of an imbalanced relationship.And Rhysand? I need him in human form. Sometime soon, universe.This book just has so many fantastical and realistic elements to it. I loved that we were able to take something a way from it, enjoy it, and I'm even happier that SJM decided to extend this series.

Quite on the contrary actually.I think we all agree, it\'s just plain wrong if a middle-aged man tries to get into a teenager\'s pants.

I understand how people would consider the sequel to be an improvement since the main character shows more agency and certain tropes are reversed, but the development was very on-the-nose and came at the expense of turning other characters into cartoonish villains. The writing suffered a lot from telling and not showing, especially when it came to the dialogue, where it mostly consisted of the main character asking questions which would result in the other faeries answering via several pages of monologues in order to tell the exposition and characters’ background stories. This would be fine if I cared about anything in the book at all, but I don’t.

If you have problems with swearing, do not read this review*Buddy read with my partners in disappointment:Katerina&Vera. Yay, we are freed from under the Mountain at last! And a special hug goes to my dear friendSimona(click on the names to see girls\' reviews) You were right, dear, reading this book and, especially, discussing it is so much fun, indeed.First of all, let me show to you a simplediagram, where you can see how the level of my engagement toward this book...uh, plummeted (actually I wanted to make the diagram more vertical, but, well, I am not good with graphic stuff) with every chapter until nothing was left for me to enjoy.And let me tell you it was a rather bumpy and painful ride.Now, let\'s clarify a few things:- I am not a fan of ACOTAR. You can see inmy reviewwhy.- I had few expectations starting this book... ah hell, I had THE ONLY expectation - Rhysand.-I do not hate this book, I dislike it.<----- I am close to hating it now.This review is probably going to be a mess of thoughts with no structure, so I am sorry in advance if it\'s confusing, I just wanted to splash out my disappointment.I liked Rhys in the previous book; I liked his darkness. I knew he was not evil and had his reasons to act as he did, and I wanted to know why. I wanted him and Feyre together. But turns out, me and Rhys are never going to happen, not because he acts OOC (out of character) - after finishing the book, I know that he didn\'t act OOC - I dislike his sugary nature; there\'s too much goodness in him, he is practically a Saint: hell, he is the Saint among Fae!“We are lucky to have him, Feyre.” I turned from the door. “I have known many High Lords,” Amren continued, studying her paper. “Cruel ones, cunning ones, weak ones, powerful ones. But never one that dreamed. Not as he does.”“Dreams of what?” I breathed.“Of peace. Of freedom. Of a world united, a world thriving. Of something better—for all of us.”Of course, the other High Lords are stupid, they don\'t see the war coming, they are not interested in peace and prosperity, only Rhys does everything, and no one wants to listen to him.Poor baby.And let\'s not forget he is the strongest Fae out there.Here—here was the most powerful High Lord ever born.The face of dreams and nightmares.Only throughout the book, there was more than one situation where his ""mighty"" powers let him down.The question: why make him so powerful, impossibly so, if a little bit of vulnerability could\'ve made him more real and likable, and suited the plot better. It\'s unnatural to be that good. He became a cardboard character with no backbone and lives only to serve Feyre, it seems.But, fuck, it wasn\'t even my biggest issue. I hated how Maascompared Tam and Rhys in this book all the time. I never liked Tam, but, seriously, how much shit you can splash on one person before he turns into shit himself? I pity Tam and what Maas did to him. Time and again Maas shoves down our throats how Rhys excels Tam in everything: Tam didn\'t want to talk to Feyre about his nightmares. Rhys wanted to talk and share. Tam never held her hair while she vomited her guts out every night (she does it a lot, by the way, nauseatingly so). Rhys held her hair and cuddled her:He never woke when the nightmares dragged me from sleep; never woke when I vomited my guts up night after night. If he knew or heard, he said nothing about it.Large, warm hands pulled my hair back a moment later.“Breathe,” Rhys said. “Imagine them winking out like candles, one by one.”I heaved into the toilet again, shuddering as light and heat crested and rushed out of me, and savored the empty, cool dark that pooled in their wake.Tam locked her up in the house and forbade her to participate in any action. Rhys allowed her to do whatever she wanted. Tam didn\'t let her visit his rooms. Rhys invited her to his;With Tamlin, he’d kept his own rooms and slept in mine. And I supposed—I supposed it’d be the same.I was almost to my bedroom door when Rhysand drawled from behind me, “We can use your room if you like, but … ” He was leaning against his open bedroom door. “Either your room or mine—but we’re sharing one from now on. Just tell me whether I should move my clothes or yours. If that’s all right with you.”Tam is starving his people. Rhys\'s people prosper (he probably gives them food for free). Tam said there are no High Ladies in Prythian. Rhys made Feyre High Lady of Night Court. Comparisons were in EVERYTHING like the author couldn\'t stop shoving up our asses how Tam is lesser than Rhys in every aspect you can think of. And all this is solely for Feyre to make it easier to dump Tam and switch to Rhys.Then there\'s Feyre and herlovesex life. Feyre said that she fell for the first guy who showed kindness to her.I’m thinking that I was a lonely, hopeless person, and I might have fallen in love with the first thing that showed me a hint of kindness and safety.But she can\'t - wouldn\'t - admit that it wasn\'t love that she felt for Tamlin. She, time and again, repeats it was love: she loved and sacrificed and then forgot the guy in two months\' time. I would\'ve respected her more if she admitted that it was lust.He buried his face in my neck and said onto my nape, as if the words would be absorbed by my body, as if he could only say it the way we’d always been good at communicating—skin to skin.Whyfeel guiltyabout wanting another male? But no, Feyre is Mary Sue, she can\'t be the simple girl who had a change of heart. She loved but had serious reasons to fell out of love.Easy-peasy. Heck, I would\'ve respected her more if she was an elite prostitute serving High Lords and choosing her next lover without shame or labeling lust as love. But she is a hypocrite and Ihate hypocrites. It leads me to my next issue.Feyre/Rhysand. Honestly, I don\'t believe Tam loved Feyre, no, they just had a comfy agreement: fuck but don\'t ask questions. Rhys, on the other hand, I believe he really loved her. What about her? No. I am still not convinced it was love from Feyre\'s side; lust - yes. Again,Feyre has a pattern: when Rhys was a bad guy, she hated him, but when he started doing good stuff for her, she realized how good he is, how kind (don\'t forget this all is in comparison with Tam like we are stupid kids and can\'t fathom the universal truth: Rhys is good, Tam is bad);Feyre doesn\'t ""love"" Rhys despite his flaws, she ""loves"" him because he has no flaws.Mr. Purrfect Perfection. And when she finally admits she wants him, she still acts like a hypocrite by saying, ""But I loved Tam, deeply, I just don\'t any longer, because he treated me badly (I still don\'t get how splashing some paint on walls and locking her up once is abusive and the reason to easily fall out of love)."" Did you love him indeed? I want to ask for the thousandth time. Feyre just says she loved him to find an excuse to fuck Rhys. And that leads us to theirmating bond.When Feyre finds out they are mates, she relaxes and thinks, ""Fuck, what a relieve now that I know Tam and I was never going to happen, I don\'t have to feel guilty any longer for wanting to fuck Rhys"". But before we cover the mating process, let\'s touch on the snotty conversation they had. If you still had any doubts before that Rhys is a Saint, believe now that he is. He is a miracle reborn. Attention: he was always kind to Feyre even when he was a dick toward her. He loved her already when they were under the Mountain, he knew they are mates, it wrecked him to hurt her; he was jealous of unworthy Tam, but Rhys was noble and didn\'t want to ruin Feyre\'s life. And that sloppy melodramatic speech of his continues for a whole chapter!""A Court of snort and boredom""as someone on GR called it once (sorry, I don\'t remember who said that or I\'d hug this person). And again, Rhy\'s goodness is shoved down our throats *gags*Mate.My—mate.This beautiful, strong, selfless male … Who had sacrificed and wrecked himself for his family, his people, and didn’t feel it was enough, that he wasn’t enough for anyone.Also, as we are on the topic... did you noticehow many times the phrase""my mate""is repeated in the book?!Hundreds of times! It\'s like a broken record player. I think if I hear ""mate"" one more time I may vomit like our Feyre-parrot does all the time.They fuck. It\'s a disaster of epic proportions. Mountain quacked. MOUNTAIN. QUACKED. Seriously? What was that? Some kind of cheap shapeshifter porn?Okay, When they are done, and I am done yawning, and we all move to civilized surroundings... wait, what the fuck is happening?!Rhys acts like an animal, he can\'t stop wanting to screw Feyre. Their mating bond makes them horny as fuck. He is so protective of his female. It\'s serious stuff among Fae folk, they could even kill if another male looks sideways at their females.“The … frenzy,” he said carefully, as if fearful the wrong word might send us both hurtling for each other before we could get sustenance into our bodies. “When a couple accepts the mating bond, it’s … overwhelming. Again, harkening back to the beasts we once were. Probably something about ensuring the female was impregnated.” My heart paused at that. “Some couples don’t leave the house for a week. Males get so volatile that it can be dangerous for them to be in public, anyway. I’ve seen males of reason and education shatter a room because another male looked too long in their mate’s direction, too soon after they’d been mated.”Faeries - cunning, highly intelligent, powerful creatures act as if they are primitive animals from a cheap porn novel. After Rhys loses some steam fighting his buddy, he goes and fucks Feyre against the table. Everyone outside hears and knows. Wonders! How civilized they are indeed! Are we supposed to find these animal games romantic? Does it suppose to be a healthy relationship?And this book is labeled as YA and published by Bloomsbury Children\'s!It is NA (new adult) or erotic at the very least!My next issue - the plot. First of all, let\'s not delude ourselves there\'s something more to the book apart from theromancemating.The plot is a crutch for the romance.Everything characters do, they do between Rhys\'s and Feyre\'s courting. And even these parts are poorly executed. Why, oh why, does Maas need to chew everything for us?! We are not stupid, we can get hints and would like to have some space left for the imagination.Show, don\'t tell.Show us through hints and glances, make us work for information; make us want to know! And the plot itself is primitive: go there, do that - monotone routine with no unexpected parts. 50% into the book and I have already known how everything would end.I don\'t understand the half-orgy scene in the Court of Nightmares where Feyre and Rhys were almost fucking while everyone watched. It was a distraction while the others were stealing something important. It\'s so stupid I can\'t even. Maas couldn\'t think of something smart for distraction, rather than thisdisgusting humiliating scene?! The best part is the ending, though. Why would mortal queens conspire with the King of Hybern? Because they want immortality? They\'ll get their immortality but will be slaves. Would it be worth it? I don\'t think so. And why demonstrate the experiment with humans turning into Fae twice? Wasn\'t one time enough, when Feyre\'s sister Elain was made into Fae? Why make the same with Nesta? Because it serves Maas\'s idea of making Feyre\'s sisters immortal and finding mighty mates for them. It doesn\'t matter that the plot looks illogical and stretched - everything is ideal for Maas\'s grand plans. Tam is a traitor because he wants Feyre back. Why, he is a reborn villain now! How stupid it is to betray your country, because of the woman who doesn\'t want you? Why villains in this book so villainous? Why there\'s no depth to them? Good is good, bad is bad. End of conversation.This book is 640 pages long. 640 pages of unnecessary descriptions of clothes, Rhys\'s goodness, Tam badness, Feyre\'s vomiting, mating, getting from point A to point B. 640 pages of parading High Lords to who I wouldn\'t trust to rule a swamp, let alone whole Kingdoms. Where\'s the smart and cunning in this book? And what kind of place is Night Court? Is it a mix of East and West and the modern world? Lace underwear, seriously?! Why does Night Court resemble so much human reality? Is this another point to Rhys\'s goodness? I have tons of questions toward this book, but I don\'t think getting my answers will somehow make it better. It\'s late for that.I wouldn\'t say there wasn\'t anything good about the book for me. Compared to Rhys and Feyre I liked secondary characters, and Cass and Nesta as a couple attract me more than Rhys and Feyre ever will. It\'s sad I am not interested in learning more about them in the context of this series.When I started this book, I practically had no expectations, and now I am angry. Angry at the book I wasn\'t even sure I would read in the first place! It\'s a new low. If this book was an erotic novel or NA, I would say, ""Good, we had sexy time"" - and move on. But this book pretends to be something different than it really is. Something more meaningful and deep, and it cruelly deceives people into thinking they are going to read a fantasy YA with a strong plotline and character development. They will be surprised to find an entirely different beast here. I am glad I am finally done with this series:no more, never again, burn in hell, book.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Re-read via audio!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '""When you spend so long trapped in darkness, you find that the darkness begins to stare back.""Yall... this book... this book and its hype... this book and its hype and all it\'s spoilers;\xa0had me worried.\xa0On\xa0top of all that\xa0I\xa0feared that this book, all 600 plus pages, would suffer a massive case of second book syndrome.

Since this book was broken up in several sections I\'m\xa0going to basically break my review down by that.A Court of Mist and Furyis the second book in theA Court of Throns and Rosesseries. This book starts off right where ACOTAR ended. Feyre, however, isn\'t recovering well from what happened to her under the mountain. It doesn\'t help that Tamlin basically avoids talking about it at all cost and he insist that she never leaves the estate. Being trapped in the house just\xa0wedding planning, with no friends, no family, and waiting for the moment when Rhys comes to claim her for their deal. Feyre is a broken girl the first part of this book. Not knowing where she stands or where she wants to be. So many things happen in the first half of this book, all leading up to Rhys finally coming to get her. That\'s all I\'m really going to say about the first\xa0section\xa0of this\xa0book.The next part of this book we finally get a lot of\xa0the answers we\'ve been dying for!

I loved that Rhys decides to surround himself with the best of the best, say F the people who don\'t see females as badass, and puts two fierce girls as part of his inner circle. Cassian and Azriel, be still my beating heart. I loved these two. What interesting characters. Each with such a unique back story.\xa0This part of the book was all about build up and setting the stage for the ending.\xa0This is why it took me awhile to get through this book... but trust me get through it, its so wroth it.The last part\xa0of this book... God give me strength! I don\'t know how I\'m even going to get through the rest of this review. This section of the book was everything I ever wanted! There is action, suspense, romance, history, and\xa0twist. Everything that was building up from the first parts were perfect set up for this to be a big bang. There were also so many things that\xa0I thought were minor details in the first book that\xa0turned out to be huge reveals in this one.\xa0I was also so worried that the ""love triangle"" aspect still hanging in the air that it would end up ruining things for me. I can\'t not address it, and I swear it\'s not a spoiler, but allthe romance in this is PERFECT. It\'s also why this book is so much bigger than the first, because it\'s so full of sexy fun times.This book is hot, HOT! I really don\'t get how this book is still categorized as Ya, I think this jumped right into NA. Seriously, so yummy! I have for sure gotten on the same ship as everyone else.The ending. So much happens. It was so amazing. Shit hits the fan! I did not see it coming. I knew one thing that was going to happen, because you can\'t not see it, but the rest of it had me on the edge of my seat. I kept screaming ""WTF"" The whole time. Like really, what just happened?!?! Those last two chapters though. Those last two chapters were.... Lord! Oh and that last paragraph! That last sentence!!!! Lets just say it was the most epic!!!I wish my review was a little more detailed, and sorry if it\'s all over the place, but that\'s how this book made me feel. A messy, disorganized, and a hot mess. I can\'t wait till book three.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'MIND=BLOWNMy hysteria is threatening to break me and I wonder if it is possible to die of elation. I\'m frozen in 35646 layers of disbelief and I\'m trying hard not to explode from the sheer impossibility of this flawless story I\'ve read. I read, read, read, and read until I reached the Acknowledgements page and knew for sure that I finished the best book I\'ve read in like... an eternity.The story is simple, really. It picks up right where it left off inA Court of Thorns and Roses.Feyre is living in the Summer court and is going to marry Tamlin. But things have changed since she has turned into High Fae, an immortal body but with a human heart: She has to stay by Tamlin\'s side and be his trophy, left with nothing to do but paint and plan her wedding with Tamlin, High Lord of the Spring Court. As she grapples with the horrors she\'s had to endure Under The Mountain against Amarantha, she also awaits Rhysand, with whom she struck a bargain to visit his Night Court for one week every month.A Court of Mist and Furywas magical. Angsty. AndDamnably beautiful.Theplotwas so tangible, I didn\'t want to get it over with. Theromancewas so tantalizing, I felt my heart pound frantically in my chest. Theambiencewas soalluring, I struggled to take my eyes off it. And thetwistswere sounexpected, I was forced to gawk and stare at the ceiling, due to relief or stupefaction, I don\'t know. I was thoroughly enchanted in a world filled with intrigue, magic, lies, and secrets and I feel weighed down by the depth of it.Sarah J. Maas\'s writing is the literal definition ofmagnificent.She creates a world so captivating and lets you drown in waves ofwonderand intrigue,enigmaand appeal. Her words are powerful, heavy with conviction, articulate, and relevant. I can\'t thank her enough for delivering this masterpiece and much more. And for introducing me to two of the best characters I can\'t stop fangirling over.Rhysand.High Lord of the Night Court; Beautiful, brutal, and powerful. He appears to be cold and arrogant initially, occasionally cracking jokes about his beauty. He is surrounded by an aura of sensuality and vivacity and he handles even the direst of situations with grace, casually yet courteously. He is as dangerous and ferocious as he is subtle and generous. He hides behind a mask of savagery and manipulation, trickery and deception but beneath the mask, he\'s kind and humble, a High Lord who cares for his people more than he deigns to express.Feyre.Our strong protagonist who develops from being oblivious in the first book to someone who didn\'t need to be coddled, pampered or protected, who didn\'t cravestabilityandcomfort, orluxuryandeasiness. She hates being judged based on her human life. She can be compassionate, affectionate, and loving, but she can also be vicious, seductive, and cunning as she sees fit. Extremely short-tempered and sometimes provocative, she makes for her shortcomings by being powerful, warm, and unbelievably loyal (Ironic, as she keeps calling herself atraitor)I really liked Tamlin inA Court of Thorns and RosesI thought I\'d be devastated by not seeing him with Feyre. But the author made it easy for me to dislike him as he wanted to lock Feyre up, keep her as his trophy and suffocate her by being overprotective.""Love was balm as much as it was poison""The reason why Feyre had been hopelessly in love with Tamlin could\'ve been because of the fact that she was lonely and desired company and so fell for the first person who showed her a hint of kindness and offered commiseration and safety.Whereas Rhysand was different, he gave Feyre the freedom to choose what she desired and believed in her capabilities. He soundlessly, silently, fought for her. A perfect gentleman.""He locked you up because he knew- the bastard knew what treasure you are. That you are worth more than land and jewels.The story also shows us how much our first impression of people/ things could be wrong in the form of role reversals in the male protagonist. Rhysand, who I once perceived as a manipulator, liar, and a ""shameless flirt"" unveils his identity mask and shows how considerate and sacrificing he can be for the people he cares about. I\'m glad I could see a whole new depth to his character, that despite being hard as a shell on the outside, he too had moments of weakness wherein he needed consolation.The book was in support of feminism andequality.It also shows how one can go to any extent to protect their friends and loved ones whilst also exemplifying thatyou can choose your family.Cassian, Azriel, Amren, and Mor were amazing support systems and I\'d give anything to meet them in real life.I could keep going on and on about it, but I think I will peace out for now. 😁✌️'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I don’t even know what to say. I’m in a frenzy. This is the strongest attachment I’ve had to a series since Twilight. I’m so addicted to you know who and I hate you know who with every fiber of my being.

I know I’m late to the game but I can’t and won’t shut up about this.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'RHYSAND PLS'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Buckle up ladies and gents and those outside these labels:Mary will have words with you (and she will stop referring to herself in third person).“When you spend so long trapped in darkness, you find that the darkness begins to stare back.”A Court of Mist and Furyis a million steps up fromA Court of Thorns and Rosesfor a thousand reasons and one. The most prominent one though, the one that glows with the fire of a thousand suns, is how—even as a cheasy, romantic fairytale—this book is more painful and human due to themes of trauma and mental health than both its predecessor and its inspirations:Beauty and the BeastturnedHades and Persephone.“To the stars who listen—and the dreams that are answered.”With anexpanded yet still fairytalish (meaning less defined rules) world,emotional, dramatic, flowing, thread-of-thought writing, andnew, captivating, and steal-your-heart-stab-you-in-the-dark characters and dynamicson top ofthemes of depression, abuse, and post traumatic stress disorder, ACoMaF really has much to talk about.Shall we begin to dig in?“[I knew that] I would never be a gentle grower of things, or someone who burned like fire—but that I would be quiet and enduring and as faceted as the night. That I would have beauty, for those who knew where to look, and if people didn’t bother to look, but to only fear it...then I didn’t particularly care for them, anyway.”Mental Health:How We Can Inflict Pain While in Pain➥PTSD, Depression, and (Possibly) BPD with Feyre & TamlinOne of the first things people criticiseA Court of Mist and Furyfor is Tamlin—some say his actions came out of the blue, while others agree that he was acting according to character but SJM made him an unnecessary villain when he could’ve been given support to heal. So before I discuss Feyre’s mental health issues and their representation, I’m going to address those two groups of people.“I am drowning. And the more you do this...you might as well be shoving my head under the water.”➤Do Tamlin’s choices come out of the blue?The answer is a simple no, and here’s why: Even inA Court of Thorns and Roses,Tamlin was a controling, aggressive, uncommunicative person who did not know how to truly listen or speak, how to be considerate and open. This makes sense because not only was he not taught any of those traits, he also experienced trauma and abuse growing up.He is extremely emotional and has no idea how to control those emotions, all while having learned to ignore his feelings because only ruthlessness equals survival and efficiency. This is unhealthy for a myriad of reasons, least of which is the fact that,no matter how willfully and insistently you turn away from your emotions, they never go away—closing your eyes so you might not see them doesn’t mean they aren’t there, it just means they’ll pounce on you in your greatest moments of weakness and you simply won’t see them coming.“The issue isn’t whether he loved you, it’s how much. Too much. Love can be a poison.”Tamlin is lonely and broken and living behind a wall of mistrust and fear, not knowing how to tear down that wall nor even acknowledging its existence. I have a couple of friends who struggle with Borderline Personality Disorder and, while I don’t want to diagnose anyone here, he actually reminded me of one of them. I will elaborate, bear with me.➤Is Tamlin’s arc unnecessary and unrealistic?That is a straight up no, because of the aforementioned friend. Much like my friend, Tamlin neither wants to acknowledge that he needs help, nor does he want to be vulnerable enough toacceptanyone’s help. Do I think he is broken beyond repair? No, no one is broken beyond repair.Our scars, however ugly, are what make us beautiful, and the cracks in a broken glass can be filled with gold, healed to become something new.But do I think he could’ve healed in this book with the help of Feyre and Lucien? Again no, because of two reasons.“There is the darkness that frightens, the darkness that soothes, the darkness that is restful.” I pictured each. “There is the darkness of lovers, and the darkness of assassins. It becomes what the bearer wishes it to be, needs it to be. It is not wholly bad or good.”❶ I’ve personally grappled with mental illnesses for years and have friends both online and offline suffering who I’ve walked this path with, dragged back from the edge of suicide, and given help and solutions to when they hurt themselves and others so they could heal. I’ve also made a very, very unhealthy choice again and again and put aside my healing to be everyone’s full-time therapist. Anyone who was in pain? I would roll up my sleeves, telling them to come seek me out whenever and for whatever, and put all my energy in the ring when they did.Now, I’ve learned something from my online big sis Cath:You areno one’s therapist(unless that’s your job ofc). And Feyre did what she could to give Tamlin the space and support he needed, but she was also suffering herself and it’s cruel and infuriating to expect her to completely forget about her own pain and force him to heal when he isn’t truly accepting or seeking help. Which is the 2nd reason.“Sweep it under the rug, like everything else.”❷It’s one thing to support and help a friend towards healing, and it’s another thing toheal them. You can’t save a drowning man who refuses to take your hand. You could jump in, grab them, and swim to shore—but there’s a high chance they would drown you, too, in their attempt to get you off them.Again, I have done this, and it’s wrong because not only was I taking away their choice and saying that I know better (which I don’t, it’s their life) I was also risking them drowning me—I don’t much care about this, let me drown who cares, but it’s not healthy behaviour.Still, I’ve done it, put life and breath and soul into showing those drowning friends why they should seek a hand to stop their drowning and learn to swim, and I’ve failed as many times as I’ve succeeded. That friend I mentioned Tamlin reminded me of? She’s one where I failed, and all I could do was watch her in pain as she lashed out and inflicted pain on others, and try my best to do damage control with her victims—because theywerevictims, as Feyre clearly is one.A victim of abuse rooted in ignored, festering pain, twisting a caring, passionate soul into a source of suffering.“There are good days and hard days for me—even now. Don’t let the hard days win.”Now that that is out of the way, how about Feyre’s struggles?➤Above all else, this book is a love letter to healing.I can’t personally vouch for the PTSD (which I found accurately written based on what I’d learned of it from others’ experiences), but I can tell you about depression. And I can tell you how heartwrenchingly Feyre’s suffocating blanket of silence that cruelly embraced her and hauled her beneath the sea resonated with me. I will leave the exploration and healing to Sarah J. Maas. Thank you.Friendship:Why We Need Support to Heal➥Rhys, Mor, Amren, Azriel, and Cass Vs. LucienI think the second best thing about ACoMaF, beside its rep, was its characters and their dynamics. More specifically, the Court of Dreams. I find that name too cheesy to swallow so from now on I’m referring to them as the Gang #sorrynotsorry.“I have so many things to deal with that I’m sometimes tempted to unleash my power across the world and wipe the board clean. Just to buy me some damned peace.”#relatable✦Rhysandmight not be my number one (or two, or even three) character in this series, but that does not mean I don’t love him, it just shows how many amazing characters grace the pages of this book—because Idolove him.He might be arrogant and teasing and always seem in control, but underlying that facade is a deeply rooted insecurity and self doubt.They do say the most seemingly arrogant people in the room are the least confident ones (I mean, I hope they do and I didn’t just creates a saying out of the blue).Confidence means believing in yourself even as you mess up, and Rhys might be arrogant but he’s not confident—his every mistake and misstep are worms he lets devour him from the inside out. And he does make mistakes, because he is not perfect, just as no one is; he is a person who, in his drive to protect and give and give andgivefrom himself until he is bled dry, tends to occasionaly refuse to share what he knows and others should be informed of. What’s most important though is howhe accepts, apologises, and learns from his mistakes because what he values most is freedom of individuals to choose the path they want to walk.“You remain your own person. You decide your fate—your choices. Not me. You chose yesterday. You choose every day. Forever.”✦Amrenwith her no-nonsense, practical, I-will-sooner-kill-you-than-coddle-you attitude is my real number one, because this unyielding Tiny Ancient One would tear the world to pieces to fight for what she holds dear—though you wouldn’t guess what it is she values with her general cutting reply to everything around her.“I once lived in a place where the opinion of others mattered. It suffocated me, nearly broke me. [...] with enough courage, you can say to hell with a reputation. You do what you love, what you need.”✦Mortakes the spot as my 2nd fave right next toAzriel; where one is fire and boldness and charisma, the other is ice and silence and an enigma, and both will have your back and front and sides all the way to the threshold of death—and beyond. And then there is babyCassianwith his insufferable arrogance and heart of marshmallows that will push you and be there to catch you if you fall. (I need to add that I will take my hope for a polyamorous relationship between these three with their complicated, enchanting dynamic to the grave and hold it close through whatever comes next).✦ But why are they so important to Feyre’s healing?Because you can’t heal alone. I’ve tried it, and the road is rockier and more precarious without a shoulder to lean on and a hand to hold.I’m still learning to not cringe at taking a hand to walk the path (and failing, not gonna lie) but I nevertheless appreciate how breathtakingly SJM writes these journeys of recovery every. damn. time. You need friends to heal, and you need to help friends to heal.“I wonder if, even in my despair and hopelessness, I was never truly alone. I wonder if I was looking for this place—looking for you all.”✦ That’s whereLucienfails. I love him and his loyal heart, but sometimes you need to check your loyalty—sometimes the people and values you are holding on to are breaking something rare and fragile.That’s the precise issue with Lucien: He does not understand the depth of Feyre’s pain, if he had, he would’ve fought without backing down, getting up each time he hit the ground, because my baby is not a coward. Alas, people don’t ever really grasp another’s invisible pain.Romance:Where Love Can Bloom(SPOILER ALERT)➥Instalove or Slow Burn, featuring Feysand“I’m thinking, that I look at you and feel like I’m dying. Like I can’t breathe.”Rhysand and Feyre are not my fave couple as their dynamic is too sweet and romantic for me personally. However, it takes nothing away from howyoufeelthem fall in love, like a flower blooming and a freezing pair of hands finding colour next to the miracle of fire, or like the warmth and light of a familiar embrace you fall into in a world of cold, dark unknowns.Some readers accuse the mating bond of being instalove in the case of Rhysand falling for Feyre. Did they read chapter 54? Rhysand fell for her as she was a human surviving Under the Mountain, and everything he did before that was him trying to save an innocent girl he suspected of being his mate but did not specifically feel anything towards.In the end, mayhaps this book is too romantic for me, the aromantic with a heart of ice, to ever be my #1 book of all time, it nonetheless makes a comfortable and cozy den in its corner becauseA Court of Mist and Furyis a fairytale that takes the dashing princes and magic, and replaces it with human suffering and healing.“You think I don’t know how stories get written—how this story will be written? I am the dark lord, who stole away the bride of spring. I am a demon, and a nightmare, and I will meet a bad end. He is the golden prince–the hero who will get to keep you as his reward for not dying of stupidity and arrogance.”CompanionsBook series playlist:Spotify URLBooks in series:➴A Court of Thorns and Roses(ACoTaR, #1) ★★★✯☆➴ A Court of Mist and Fury (ACoTaR, #2) ★★★★★➴A Court of Wings and Ruin(ACoTaR, #3) ★★★★☆➴A Court of Frost and Starlight(ACoTaR, #3.1) ★★★☆☆➴Untitled Novella(ACoTaR, #3.2) ☆☆☆☆☆➴A \u200bCourt of Silver Flames(ACoTaR, #4) ☆☆☆☆☆'}]"

And I cook a delicious meal for the whole family before heading up to eat alone in my tiny room on the top floor.I try to ignore how Nina makes a mess just to watch me clean it up. How she tells strange lies about her own daughter. And how her husband Andrew seems more broken every day.

IYKYK, my reviews are always honest.Writing: idk out of 5 | Plot: ????2???/5 | Ending: 5/5 tbhAfter letting this marinate for a couple of hours, 2 stars is the way to go.THE PLOTMillie is living in Casa Nissan aka her car when she\'s hired as the maid for the Winchesters, a ridiculously wealthy family. She\'s over the moon to have a job and a bed, but she quickly realizes something funky is happening in the home. And she\'s not sure if she\'ll make it out alive... dun dun dunnnnnn!!!!!MY OPINIONHonestly... I\'m confusion. This is how I felt after I readThe Trapped Wifeby Samantha Hayes. On one hand, this was garbagio, on the other hand, it had some things that kept me reading and enjoying myself. It\'s a book I love to hate and hate to love all at once. Ok, let me try to make sense of thoughts:- Millie\'s POV is straight up ""dear diary"" style. As in, ""I spent 7 hours cleaning the house and I thought about Andy Winchester\'s bangin bod the entire time. He is so dreamy. Does he like me too????"" It\'s also giving me ""rages to riches"" fanfic written by a tween vibes. BUT AT THE SAME DAMN TIME... the book was legit funny in parts???? Like great dark humour throughout????- Millie\'s character makes no sense. Not a spoiler—she spends 10 years in jail. Yet she has zero survival skills and seems relatively unbothered by the fact she was locked up for an entire decade. I\'m telling you right now I can\'t last 10 MINUTES in jail unscathed, so a whole ass decade would have me coming out on some Rambo shit.- I did not like Nina. She was over the top, selfish, and illogical. I can\'t feel sorry for what she went through because .... No spoilers.... but if you read it, you\'ll know.- The ""mystery"" is kinda obvious. It\'s likeThe Wife Between Usmixed with... idk,Gone Girl? There wasn\'t really any suspense. You know what\'s gonna happen. From Part II onward I was speed reading like a mf. But I was invested in the whole revenge vibe like ok girl go OFFFFFF.- I gave the ending 5/5 because it\'s women\'s history month and that\'s all I can say without spoiling it- I\'ve readThe Locked Doorby this author and this was a totally different vibe. Good for her for going in a totally different direction with no projection of her medical career/knowledge in the story. I\'m not sure if it worked, but at least the ending was better than Locked Door.I can see people really enjoying this or really hating it. Do not expect this to be a literary masterpiece. You will not be mentally stimulated in any way. This is your standard popcorn thriller but not as annoying as Unmissing, Stay Awake, etc because of the dark humour. This is the type of book you read afterMy Dark Vanessarips your heart out and stomps all over it.PROS AND CONSPros: you\'ll keep reading because you don\'t know if you like it or hate it, awesome dark humour, great endingCons: vapid plot and characters, rags to riches fanfic written by a 14 yo vibes, dear diary ass writing'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '“The Housemaid” by Freida McFadden is just one of those novels that for years to come, I will speak highly of and recommend to anyone that wants an incredible thriller. One that’s also filled with mystery and psychological terror all wrapped together brilliantly. From McFadden’s excellent writing style to all the characters I absolutely loved, this is easily one of the best novels of 2022.It’s a very addictive read that is so hard to put down, you’ll more than likely find yourself reading deep into the night because it’s a genuine page-turner. I loved all the little revelations that pop up here and there on top of an incredible story. Just when you think you have it figured out, this novel turns your world upside down.Don’t worry, I will not go into any specifics or spoil anything for you but I’d consider this a must-read novel. Besides the fantastic pacing, I also loved all the New York references since I’m a New Yorker and it really felt close to home. Thinking back on everything, I can’t tell you how many authentic jaw-dropping moments I had while reading this as this novel completely blew my mind.The ending was beyond satisfying and just something I didn’t expect at all! LoL saying it was a drop-the-mic moment is an understatement. This was a wild, insane, fun, adrenaline-filledthriller that kept me on the edge of my seat. It was a wonderful reading experience as I wish every novel I read was like this!I give “The Housemaid” by Freida McFadden a perfect 5/5 as this is a masterpiece. I’ve read many novels in my life and this is one of the most memorable ones that will forever stand out for me. This novel was unique, exciting, and everything you could ever want in a thriller and then some. It’s a rollercoaster of a read from start to finish and I can honestly say that McFadden has a new reader in me. This was the first novel I’ve read by her and I’m genuinely excited to read more of her work and whatever future novels she writes. She is an amazing author with one incredibly creative and talented mind!'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '3.5 stars — I decided to read another Freida McFadden book because I wanted a page turner that didn’t require much thinking. “The Housemaid” had gotten numerous high reviews so I decided to try it. The book started off very good and had me hooked from the beginning. It tells the story of Millie a recent parolee who is homeless and in need of a job. When she gets hired by Nina and Andrew as a live-in housemaid/nanny she believes she has found her dream job. But soon she realizes that Nina is a very difficult person to work for (think Meryl Streep in “The Devil Wears Prada”). I really enjoyed the interactions between Millie and Nina and her family. I was squarely in the 4.5 to 5 stars range up until the final 30 pages or so of the book. I won’t spoil it but to say the actions of the police, Enzo, Millie and Nina were ridiculous is such an understatement of how bad this book came to a close I can’t describe it. I don’t remember yelling out “No” and “come on” and “really” while reading a book before. (Yes I’m weird) but I had no choice considering the epic plot collapse that left me shaking my head.

Italian to English is right there on your damn phone.Nina’s chapters are bizarre.I’m still not sure what the “big” twist is. There are several reveals, but nothing earth-shattering.This tries to be an upscale version of Minka Kent...or a low-budget version of Sarah Pinborough.

The only downside to that, though, is that it did take me a little bit to care about Millie because we didn't know a lot about her in the beginning.Overall 4 stars!

After all the buzzing hype surrounding this book that never seems to diminish, I finally decided it was time to dive in and award myself some entertaining popcorn reading. However, oh boy, this book absolutely deserves every bit of its never-ending hype. It exceeded my expectations, had me gritting my teeth, squirming restlessly in my seat, and, even though I anticipated the delicious twist from the beginning, I still admired how the author perfectly developed this smart cat-and-mouse game. The last third, in particular, was exceptionally brilliant! I knew right from the beginning that I would enjoy this heart-throbbing, jaw-dropping, unputdownable, twisty psychological thriller, but I didn't expect to love it even more and immediately decided to jump into the next book of the series, despite some reviews emphasizing that it might not be as good as the first one. I just couldn't resist spending more time in Millie the maid's disturbing, mind-bending world!Meet Millie: recently released from prison for a crime we don't know if she committed or what kind of crime she got involved in. She's homeless, living in her Nissan, worn down from her latest job at the bar, getting rejected even from burger joints, barely having a chance to start over at her young age (she's in her mid-twenties, a pretty girl, but she disguises her beauty behind glasses and baggy clothes, just in case somebody thinks she's too attractive to be hired). She can't believe her luck when her application as a housemaid at Winchester House (correction: it's a mansion surrounded by a gate with a beautiful landscape) is approved by Nina Winchester: a stay-at-home wife, a bit overweight, dressed only in white, a sophisticated woman who seems friendly at first sight.Millie is introduced to Nina's little girl, who looks like she jumped out of a Children of the Corn movie with her weird baby doll dress, white-blond hair, and spoiled brat attitude that rubs her the wrong way. Then there's the father, the breadwinner of the family, the overly handsome Andrew Winchester, who seems like Prince Charming and whom Millie can barely stop herself from drooling over.Millie doesn't mind that she has to live in the attic, with a room that has the tiniest window that never opens and a lock outside the door that mostly gets stuck. She also keeps herself in check as Nina's emotionally unstable behavior pushes her buttons until they nearly fall to the floor. She can't flip the bird to her unsatisfied, bickering, witchy employer and her irritating, annoying little daughter because if she doesn't get a good reference from her employer, she's forced to live in her car, violating her parole, which could send her back to prison. She keeps her mouth shut, but it's not easy to deal with Nina's mood swings.When she learns a dirty little secret about Nina's past and gets warned by the hot, candy-like landscaper Enzo, who unfortunately speaks only Italian, she realizes that by accepting this job, she may be putting her life in danger. Especially when it's so tempting to get seduced by Mr. Winchester, while his wife watches them like a jealous hawk, ready to tear her limbs apart. Oh, Millie, you've found yourself in another prison you can't escape, haven't you?Overall, I'm giving this highly earned five stars and diving into the next novel of Millie the Maid as fast as possible!

How does this have such a high rating?WHAT TO EXPECT:✨ psychological thriller✨ mystery✨ plot twists✨ TW: infidelity, domestic abuse, torture, toxic relationship, murder, death (this is not a complete list, so be sure to research the trigger warnings before)My Thoughts:What a fucking waste of my time. I am annoyed I read this book and cannot believe it came so highly recommended. There\'s so much I can say but I\'ll keep this review short since I don\'t want to spend more time thinking about this book than I have to.I hardly ever read thrillers yet I was able to predict everything.I honestly wish I DNF\'d but I decided to keep going for the big plot twists that I was told would completely surprise me; but alas, they did not. The author basically tells you what\'s going to happen next by making the narrator have internal dialogue that panders to the reader. Here are a few examples.1. The FMC, Millie, enters the room she will be living in and goes,""There was something about that room that was very scary.""Oooooo, I bet something terrible happened there. *I say this sarcastically*2. Millie meets the gardener and she notices,""There\'s something in his expression that sends a chill down my spine. And then he shakes his head, almost imperceptibly. Almost like he\'s trying to warn me.""And then he tells her it\'s dangerous and she should leave. Huh, I wonder why the gardener would tell a random woman she\'s in danger living in this rich suburban home as the maid. What could possibly go wrong?3. Millie meets the husband and immediately notices how hot he is.""It\'s hard not to notice that he is several levels more attractive than his wife.""And throughout the story she constantly comments on how handsome he is. I wonder what\'s going to happen between the super hot maid and her super hot employer. . .4. Millie\'s bedroom door locks from the outside and she notices there are scratches on the door,""Like somebody was scraping at the door. Trying to get out.""Cue the Cardi-B viral sound ""That\'s suspicious. That\'s weird."" We all know she\'s getting locked in that room at some point.There\'s a lot more but again, I don\'t want to spend more time on this book so, moving on to my next point.The writing was juvenile.Along with the author\'s penchant for pandering to the reader, the book was just so average written. It felt like someone in high school wrote it. Simple writing. Basic characters. Unrealistic development.Millie was an unbearable FMC.She\'s a recently released convict and has had a hard time keeping a job. She\'s desperate, which is why she overlooks all the red flags about this new job as a maid. But for fuck\'s sake, it\'s like she has zero self preservation. I absolutely hated her and the choices she made throughout the story. The only redeeming thing about her was how she handles everything at the end.But that ending has me laughing because of the sheer stupidity of it all.You\'re telling me Millie has been a dud for the entire book but somehow she comes out on top at the end? I don\'t believe it but whatever.Overall, this book was a miss and I do not recommend it. I should be giving this 1 stars because I legit didn’t like anything about it. But it was readable and even if predictable, there was a cohesive plot. . . so I’ll give it 1.5 stars.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Thank you to the publisher and NetGalley for providing me with a copy of this novel for an honest review. It has been published in April 2022.""The Housemaid"" by Freida McFadden was a bit of a disappointment to read.First of all, the tagline ""From behind closed doors, she sees everything"" must have been chosen by someone who never read the book, because it couldn\'t be farther from the truth: Millie goes through the novel blissfully unaware of everything that happens around her, be it behind closed doors or not. Even the most telegraphed plot twists somehow catch her by surprise, despite all the warning signs and the not-so-cryptic warnings she receives from other characters. The only ones who see everything from behind closed doors areAndrew and Enzo, and how sad it is thata novel written by a woman, with a woman as a protagonist, should depict both its female main characters as such hapless damsels in distress?Nina has no agency at all, she\'s only good to be rescued by her super-hot, muscled, Italian stud, and even Millie shows no initiative at all up until the very ending.On the good side, the narrative flows easily enough, making the read a quick one. On the not so good side, there are some huge plotholes that make the whole novel feel like a joke: for starters,Enzo\'s charade doesn\'t hold water. It\'s simply not believable that a man in his thirties who has lived and worked in the US for 3 years, being employed by a dozen families in such a posh neighbourhood, and who is considered the best at what he does, would not speak any English at all, not even the most basic communication that Italian children are taught in primary school. When we find out that he\'s just pretending, it\'s even worse! How would he ever get a job with all those very wealthy, very elitist families if he wasn\'t able to let on that he spoke the language? How would he be able to follow his customer\'s instructions, to the point that he\'s considered ""the best at his job"", if he had to pretend he didn\'t understand them at all?And what about the ""translating apps"" that Millie mentions in the very beginning of the book, hoping that they\'ll help her communicate with Enzo, except then she never uses them, never mentions them again and spends the rest of the novel complaining that she has no way of communicating with Enzo?What about the security guard who searches Millie on the basis of a random phonecall tipping him off about her alleged shoplifting? In the real world, no security guard in their right mind would do such a thing: they would more likely enquire who the person calling them is, and how can they know who is a shoplifter and describe how the shoplifter is dressed, since they\'re calling *from outside the shop*.How can Millie describe her new, tiny attic room in the Winchester house as an ""inhuman place, like a torture chamber"", when she\'s been living in the back of her car right before moving to said attic room, and has spent 10 years in jail right before that?Let\'s not even mention how far-fetched the twist aboutthe policeman\'s daughteris, and how it would be absolutely impossible to simplydrop an investigation like that, even if a random policeman decided to.Still, I wouldn\'t have minded the plotholes so much if the characterisation hadn\'t been so bad: literally all of the characters, including the protagonist, are nothing more than stock characters, flat, cartoonish figurines in no way relatable or interesting. On top of that, all 4 main characters (I\'m counting the 9-year-old brat as well, yes) are completely, irredeemably despicable. The only vaguely likeable character is Enzo, but then he\'s a walking stereotype, so in the end I didn\'t like him either.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'what in the batshit crazy, psycho, disturbing verity by colleen hoover was thatgive me more'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""It was a quick fun read, exactly what I needed. The book gripped me from the start and I struggled to put it down.The story is not something unique tbh. But the way it's told is chef's kiss.

I think I have only read 6 with 4 of them being Holly Jackson's books but that's pretty much it, and I remembered how quickly I read them and how much I enjoyed some of them so I decided that I was going to read a lot of thrillers when I got free in June and The housemaid was the first target and it's safe to say, I loved it. The way this was so fast paced and it had me hooked!! I would've read it in one sitting but because of Eid and having so many guests over and with my cousins coming to stay with us, it made it hard for me to binge read this but I still read a huge portion of it whenever I picked it up, I was literally forced to keep it down. I stand by what I said, thrillers are the hardest to write because it's a mess at the start, there are so many leads and only one culprit and the way you have to tie all of them together while keeping the reader hooked is a really hard job which Freida nailed 🤭 this book also gave me verity vibes and I was here for it.The story follows our main character Millie who's an ex-convict, desperate for a job. She finds one as a housemaid for the Winchesters and from there onwards her life starts to get messy. I would say Millie in this book was a badass, especially with how everything was done in the end 😭🤌🏻 wow just wow. I really liked her. I won't talk about Nina and Andrew because they are heavily tied to the plot and plot twists and well....I mean I guessed the main twist but not the intensity of it but some of you may not so I won't say anything except for how conflicting and interesting characters they were to read and 👀 Enzo 👀 can we get more scenes of him??In thrillers the one thing I learned was that it's never the first person who the MC thinks of as the culprit so my doubts were on someone else and I had predicted that it would be them but didn't know why or how and man 💀 that was fucked up, the intensity of what they did skyrocketed it really helped me feel for our victim.I also liked how well it was partitioned into three parts and how one followed mille then Nina and then both.Overall, I think that all that I can talk about without spoiling anything but I would definitely recommend it because I had an amazing time.____This is Freida McFadden's highest rated book.......let's see what the hype is all about 🤭(Let the June thriller tbr marathon begin!)""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '★4 stars“""I can’t seem to shake that uneasy feeling. That I should get out of here while I still can.""As this is aspoiler free reviewit\'s going to be short and sweet as I can\'t say too much. I can see why this psychological thriller is so popular! It\'s definitely a fast faced page turner.The plotMillie Calloway is hired to be an in-house maid for the Winchesters’ in a time when she is desperate, living out of her car and no one will take a chance on her. The Winchesters’ are a very well off, upper-class couple who have a 9 year old daughter, Cecila. When Millie enters the house she starts to realise that not everything is as perfect as it seems. Unfortunately for Millie, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.╰⪼Thoughts""There’s something about this room that’s making a little ball of dread form in the pit of my stomach.”The first 30% of the book was pretty slow for me but once I pushed past this it really picked up. This book is filled with plot twists and when you think you have it figured out, there\'s further reveals. It kept me on edge and while I did suspect some things earlier on, there was definitely a lot of build up towards the end that I didn\'t see coming 👀 The few twists I did guess didn\'t take away from my enjoyment of the book. This was my first Freida McFadden book and won\'t be my last.I found the writing style to be quite simple and the chapters were relatively short which made this book binge-worthy.The Housemaidis perfect if you are new to the thriller genre or picking one up after a long time. The few issues I had in the first 30% which kept my rating from being higher was that I felt the author was trying too hard to tell me how to feel as the hints and \'thriller elements\' weren\'t subtle. I also found the last couple of chapters to be a little rushed. I wanted to have chills but I sadly didn\'t feel that way but I was definitely hooked on this book.Overall, I thought the epilogue was fantastic and I can\'t wait to see what happens in books 2 and 3. This book is very entertaining and will whisk you away into the thick of it. There are some slight romance elements as well which might entice you to pick this up if you are new to thrillers.

It is so bizarro that you keep clicking on your cell phone to check if the world is still out there and you\'re not registered somewhere in a padded cell.Millie comes up short where luck is concerned. She\'s always been at the wrong place and at the wrong time pretty much all of her life. Millie\'s been living in her cramped little car for some time now.

Cecelia, nine years old, is spoiled rotten and lights up Millie every chance she gets.

The pace and the short chapters keep this one afloat. The storyline has a familiar ring to it as those of us who\'ve read a billion psychological thrillers know. McFadden throws in a few zingers and twists to liven it up. Foolish people get fooled. Street-wise never do. But you press on just to experience the final outcome. And when it comes.....it comes. Not a blockbuster read by any means, but it\'s already been popular because of that eye-poking cover.

The person she hires will need to be desperate for a job, and have CERTAIN personality traits.Millie fits the criteria.She is willing to live in the tiny ATTIC room, with only one window, which seems to be painted shut, and has a lock on the OUTSIDE of the door-and she is tolerant of Cecelia who is dressed up like Wednesday from the Adams family, but definitely doesn’t have the manners of a pretty little girl.She must also need the job enough to also tolerate the split personality of Nina, herself!I enjoyed Millie’s sense of humor, and was curious to see where this would go-initially.Then came Part Two, and there is a SURPRISING twist, but it’s very OTT and the story goes off the rails at this point. 🚂And, in PART THREE, the story twists yet again.Sure, I realize this story is meant to be taken with a grain of salt, preferably served on buttered popcorn, 🍿 but, the last two parts were too crazy for my taste!But, there are MANY 5 star reviews so, IF the crazier the better is what you are looking for-it should satisfy YOU! 😉'}, {'rating': None, 'content': 'Pre-readThis is gonna be my first thriller so please be good🤞🏼'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Outlier alert!!Millie = the ex con has just being hired as a maid.

If you feel satisfied enough to just remove yourself from this review, run with that feeling. Because I have, like. Seven pages of sh*t to complain about.That’s if I’m efficient.And I’ve never been an efficient reviewer. Once. In my life. I counted two hundred (and two) uses of a word over seven hundred pages. That shouldn’t scream “rational and in control of her passionate fury” to you.So buckle up, buttercup. We’ve got some categories to run through.DISCLAIMER: This review is teeming with spoilers. It is also X-rated, due to the strength of my anger and the copious sex scenes in the source material.I HATE THESE CHARACTERSRhysmakes me cringe harder than Renee Zellweger in Bridget Jones’ Diary. (At least that movie has both Colin Firth and Hugh Grant to distract me from Renee viciously critiquing her own body and, like, spilling coffee all over herself or whatever.) He is capable of two actions, like a mildly impressive Ken doll: 1) sex person and 2) valiant hero trying to kill himself in the name of his friends constantly. Either he is full on f*cking Feyre (sick alliteration, Emma) or he must be actively prevented from jumping in front of poisoned weapons with the half-hearted motivation of Heroism To Save My Family (even if it’s not at all clear why doing this would save them, because whatever none of the plans in this book make a lick of sense anyway).Because, as if this book weren’t fun enough, it rivals the Fast and the Furious franchise for use of the my-real-family-is-the-one-I-made-not-the-one-I-was-born-with cliché.Like Rhys,Feyrealso manages to find time in her packed schedule of sex scenes and repetitive dialogue to be incredibly, incontrovertibly dumb. For example, when she traps Ianthe and ties her up or whatever, she spends an unbelievable amount of time indulging an evil-villain-revenge rant. Just enough time for her to be CAUGHT BY THE DAEMATI (a Cassandra Clare-esque douchey term that pretty much means “species of bad guy,” to the best of my recollection). So much of this book was me silently screaming.Speaking of the aforementioned schedule, it’s no wonder that that thing Feyre used to do called “painting” is dropped like a hot potato. She never does it, but it’s mentioned a handful of times in the beginning of the book. And then forgotten. And then, suddenly, almost at the merciful end of this suffering:“The movement so perfect that I knew I’d one day paint it.”We’restillpretending that Feyre paints? Between the same diverse selection of identical sex scenes, identical training scenes, identical war discussion scenes, I don’t think she has time for something so banal as a singular interest or hobby. Idk if we’ll have time; I think she’ll have to get to third base with Rhys in a perfumed bath later.At least Feyre is brave and strong, though. Which is why she’s “too tired” to do anything after a loooong day of watching other people fight in a battle, followed by Mor winnowing her home. So courageous. How does she do it.Plus, she’s a brilliant friend. Which is why, when Morrigan confronts her for lying, leaving, making her and everyone else fear she has died and also making Mor responsible for it, Feyre’s response is “OH YA??? WELL YOU HAVE A CRUSH ON AZRIEL.”Truly a depiction of a powerful woman for the ages.And I don’t getLucien’s appeal. Do we like him out of the same reason we like Draco? (I’m saying “we” as if I like either of those characters.) Is it an omg-he’s-just-trying-to-do-right-he-didn’t-know-any-better type situation? Because Draco is a child trying to impress a father who doesn’t love him and I still don’t totally buy that. I’m still not a Draco fan. And Tamlin is not Lucien’s daddy, although...maybe a more interesting book if he were.CassianandAzrielare both flat and boring.Amrenis characterized so inconsistently that it’s impossible for me to know whether I like her or not. (I’m going to say “not” - seems like a safer bet.)Nestais almost cool, but the whole I Am Mean And Hard And Damaged thing goes too far. AndElainjust floats around and lets things happen to her.Morrigan, never all that interesting, now just represents the worst bisexuality rep I’ve ever read.It’s never a good sign when you’re praying for characters to die in battle just so you can catch a f*cking break.But guess what. None of them do.THE WRITING SUCKS, ON BOTH A COPYEDITING LEVEL AND A SUBSTANTIVE LEVELI truly believe that whatever team of sad sacks was assigned to copyedit this book was physically unable to attentively read it. And I cannot blame them. But it does allow for some hilarious mistakes to make it through these dull, dull pages.Example: “She did not avert her eyes from the Morrigan.” That pesky “the” makes her seem like a pro wrestler, or someone with a fun nickname, rather than the personification of the worst bi rep ever to grace young adult pages. But we’ll get to that.There are so many ellipses and dashes and italicizations and...other - ways: ofbreakingup the TEXT that it actually gave me motion sickness. On top of everything else this book has made me suffer through.Maybe if a copyeditor had found the strength to make it through this book, they could have stopped the way SJM insists on using the term “Hybern.” IT MEANS SO MANY THINGS. “Hybern” is used as the nomer of the evil king, the word for his people, the name of his kingdom, and the title of the land it’s situated on. That is just...basic bad worldbuilding, no?Also, a monster creature thing described as having no eyelids narrows its eyes. This inspired a fifteen minute long discussion with my roommates on whether eyes can narrow without eyelids. We came to a unanimous consensus: no, they cannot.Also, asValpointed out in her amazing review of this book, the words “vulgar gesture” are used over. And over. And over again. WHAT DO THESE USES MEAN. WHY DO THEY CONSTANTLY INSPIRE LAUGHTER IN WHATEVERGLORIFIED PROPCHARACTER WHO HAPPENS TO BE NEARBY. IS THIS TACTIC SUPPOSED TO REPLACE ACTUAL JOKES OR BANTER? Because it doesn’t. It just makes me angry, and also confused, which makes meeven angrier.And who thought that was even possible.WHAT IS THIS ATTEMPT AT HIGH FANTASY LANGUAGEExcept then, y’know, Rhys and Feyre and the Gang are also so hip and cool and up to date that this book uses the word “fuckable,” a word so slang-y that my laptop recognizes it as a typo for “suckable” or “faceable,” whatever the hell those words are.Otherwise, the only other remarkable attempt at making this any different from the way humans speak in 2017: the use of the word “male.”Women are sometimes called “females” in this, but are also called women and girls and whatnot. Men, on the other hand, are absolutely only called males. There’s an amazing moment when SJM refers to Rhys as a man, and then instantly, like, corrects herself. So it reads on the page as “man - male -”It makes no sense. I love it.It’s truly the little things.THE END OF THIS BOOK IS JUST A LISTING OF CLICHESAs the war we’ve waited for finally arrives, and so does the time for motivational speeches and tragic goodbyes and other things that fail to make me feel something, SJM loses it entirely.Nearly every line of dialogue in this section is just a cliché, and so I will copy and paste them here, for your perusal and accompanying amusement.“Leave this world…a better place than how you found it.”“One life may change the world.”“I believe everything happens for a reason.”“It is the family you make, not the one you are born into, that matters.”“Light can be found even in the darkest of hells.”“The great joy and honor of my life has been to know you.”“I wasn’t sure if in the entire history of Illyria, there had ever been such a discussion.”So bad. And, therefore, so good.LET’S LAUGH AT DUMB THINGSThe moments when this may or may not be attempting to instill some sort of entertainment or amusement in its reader do not work at all. Luckily, we have something much better: Really dumb stuff. It is much more fun (and nourishing to the very soul, like a bowl of chicken soup - so pretty much the series of books “Chicken Soup for the Soul”) to laugh at something unintentional and dumb than it is to laugh at a cheap joke. This is why the show America’s Funniest Home Videos has been on for twenty-eight seasons, and like a thousand interchangeable bad sitcoms are canceled every year.For example, this passage. Feyre and Rhysand are apart, blah blah blah, it’s the tragedy of the century (or millennium, since these boring ass people live for infinity, because there is no justice in this world). Unsurprisingly, they use their mind control powers for a saintly motivation: sexting. Which is already so hilarious. But it gets even better, because:“I sent back an image of me sticking out my tongue at him.My clothes were back on when his answer arrived.Like mine, it was wordless, a mere image. Like mine, Rhysand’s tongue was out.But it was occupied with doing something else.”I choose to interpret this statement the same way a middle schooler interprets the existence of performer Marilyn Manson based on a shady rumor he once heard about a surgery to remove three ribs. I believe that this is incontrovertible evidence that Rhysand can suck his own d*ck. WHAT ELSE COULD HE POSSIBLY BE DOING. WHAT COULD IT POSSIBLY BE OCCUPIED WITH. SJM I JUST WANNA TALK.But just as often as I was making myself laugh by making Rhys my YA fantasy version of Marilyn Manson, I was being equally amused by seemingly innocuous lines. Like when Eris, scary villain/abuser extraordinaire, was bidding The Night Gang adieu and said, “See you at the meeting in twelve days.” I MEAN. WHAT. WHO SPEAKS LIKE THAT. Even dialogue is just an opportunity to force an info dump. You guys, seriously: this book isso poorly written.LET’S SCREAM ABOUT DUMB THINGSSometimes, or most of the time depending on how you look at it, I do not want to laugh at the dumb things. Sometimes I am incapable of it, because this book is an ungodly length and so much of it is long-term stupidity.Chapter 45, for example. Or, as I like to call it, “That Meeting in Twelve Days Finally Happens.” Yes, this book is so boring that we are expected to anticipate an actual, literal meeting. Sure, it’s a meeting between high lords to talk about war, but it’s still a sit-down political discussion. And also it’s just the same endless repetitive cycle of insult dialogue feat. fun moments of The Night Gang being the least convincing people on the entirety of the Earth.There’s an especially great moment in that adrenaline-inducing conference. For the 800 pages leading up to it, Rhys is all,“Ok, Feyre. Listen up. Number one thing - just don’t show your powers, k? Long story short the Powerful Men are going to get pissy and then…well y’know these negotiations are the most important thing to happen in hundreds of years, which I should know because I’ve been alive for that long, even though you’re, what, fresh outta adolescence? Anyway just the only thing you should do is not show your powers.”To which Feyre’s response is,“Got it. *shows powers instantly*”YES. Feyre shows her powers at the meeting!! So quickly!!! She doesn’t even try all that hard, and, as promised, it almost derails the nonstop excitement of this much-anticipated civilized forum! Almost. Except then everything works out, as it always does, by Feyre saying something totally normal, 6/10 at best, and everyone being like “wow omg...who is this girl...she is so smart and brave and honest and we respect her so much” so that Rhys can be like “that’s my mate lol.”IRRELEVANT COMPLAININGThe only way to make the experience of reading a deeply unpleasant, extremely long book worse is to publish that book with goddamn tissue paper pages. This was like reading the Bible but without the action. And with a whole lot more smut.I’m tucking this quote in this section too, because I don’t know if I’m being persnickety, but at one point, it’s said that“Only a madman would wield the might of his army just to get revenge on three women.”And my question is, why use the word “women”? Why not “people”? Is it more insane if it’s women? Why is that? TELL ME WHY. REALLY I JUST WANNA TALK.PLOTLINE? WHAT PLOTLINEThis book is just...so boring.There are countless info dumps, which, I mean. There’s no excuse for that in a third book. This was going to be the last book in the series, when there was still hope in the world and I prayed that somehow SJM actually was writing these books for some sort of artistic fulfillment rather than money. How, I ask you, would there still be so much sh*tty worldbuilding in the last book in a series?OH YES, THIS BOOK IS DEFINITELY WOKE AND NOT THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF THAT ENTIRELYSJM has been getting a lot of sh*t lately for her white/straight/cis narratives. So it’s no surprise that she would try to get those pesky activists off her back this time. Unfortunately, she does a remarkably bad job.This book is all straight people except for LGBT+ relationships based on sex alone, or in an unequal relationship wherein one person has authority over another. (Examples: a high lord whose bisexuality extends purely to the fact that he’s into threesomes; a military captain dating his high lord/commander/boss.)Plus, there’s bisexuality rep so terrible it took me hours to make it through a handful of pages. But that gets a category of its own.I also shouldn’t be surprised at the redemption of abusers in this book. Because Tamlin, in ACOTAR, was just a Nice Guy. Fine. But the fangirls loved a certain bad boy guest star with purple eyes. So, instead of creating a love triangle or transitioning between love interests like a normal person, SJM made him into an actual abuser. A villain.That’s also fine. But you can’t just redeem him like you could redeem the unloved side of a love triangle. Because you made him into a genuinely bad person.Unfortunately, SJM must have missed that memo. She must have missed it three times, actually, because Eris also gets redemption (and a throne!). As does his enabler brother, Lucien. Wonderful. Abuse apologists for the win.But this book is totally, definitely feminist, right??? I mean, female protagonist! War plotline! It must be, by default! So when Cassian says“I told you that the moment we started letting females into our group, they’d be nothing but trouble”, and woke king Rhys responds,“You actually said you needed a reprieve from staring at our ugly faces, and that someladieswould add some much needed prettiness for you to look at all day.”it’s totally fine!So it’s an utter shock that this narrative also lives nearly entirely within the bounds of gender roles. Reading about men (Rhys, Cassian, Azriel, all the high lords) fighting in battle while the women (Feyre, Mor, Elain, Nesta, Cresseida) watch and tend to the wounded later is sorefreshing. Doesn’t make me want to blow my brains out at all.And no, Mor being assigned to babysit Feyre later on, only heading into battle because Feyre tricks her into fighting so she can sneak away does not make it better, thanks.This is definitely, certainly the feminist YA fantasy you’ve been waiting for, folks.THE WORST BI REP EVER TO HIT THE SHELVES, WHICH IS INSANE BECAUSE WHEN IS THERE E V E R GOOD BI REPBut I haven’t mentioned the most unforgivable thing yet. The thing that made this book my first SJM one-star, after giving every other book I’ve read by her two stars. The thing that actually made me feel real hatred and fury and, worst of all, sadness.Truly, the worst bisexual representation I have ever read comes in the final chapters of this book. I’ve read a lot of bad bisexual rep. And it’s endlessly upsetting. But none of it felt quite like this.Apparently, Sarah J. Maas decided in the third book that she wanted to stop getting sh*t for her heteronormativity. So she decided to take a character who had been established as straight, and make her bi.So she took this character, Morrigan. She makes Morrigan cry. She writes Morrigan’s impassioned speech to Feyre. This is Morrigan’s coming out, for the first time. Morrigan says that she prefers women. To the point that she is only capable of feeling romantic love for a women.But occasionally, she will force herself to sleep with a man. In order “to keep people from looking too closely.” Instead of telling the man who has been in love with her for centuries that she doesn’t love him back, won’t ever love him back, she forces herself to sleep with men when he’ll know that she’s done it, so that she still seems straight but he’ll know she doesn’t love him.And the author dubs it bisexuality.I hate that she felt entitled to use this underrepresented, misunderstood sexuality as a playing piece in her own quest to be well-liked. I hate that the hundreds of thousands of people who read this book have been given this depiction of bisexuality. And I hate that Sarah J. Maas will keep writing wildly successful books. Books in this very series, depicting this character in this way and calling it “bisexuality.”It’s unfair. It’s awful. And I am never, never, never going to forget that it happened.Bottom line: I didn’t expect to like this book. But I also didn’t expect it would become one of my least favorite books I’ve ever read.----pre-reviewI did it.Everyone told me I couldn't do it.Just DNF it,they said.You're being insane,they said.Why would you force yourself through 700 pages of misery?

No, I don’t. Good kids.“You High Lords really do love your melodrama, don’t you?”(As if I hadn\'t got enough ammo already.)For honesty\'s sake, the last two thirds of the book I could only bring myself to skim through (and I\'m quite proud of myself for managing even that). The first third had accurately enlightened me as to what I was to expect, and my (abysmally low) expectations were met point by point.We girls of the SmutClub weren\'t able to do a proper buddy read as we did last year with ACoMaF due to real life kicking our asses. However, I\'m sure you don\'t want to missSarah\'sandReyes\'sreviews, andEmer\'scall for honesty and good sense when it comes tothe target market of this series(and of theThrone of Glassseries too, at this point) perfectly highlights a problem I haven\'t been able to wrap my mind around since it first arose.•First of all, I\'d like to take a moment to answer a question that no one asked but that I think it fair to take into account nonetheless, said question being, ""If you evidently don\'t like Maas\'s books, why do you keep reading them?""Very good point indeed.I used to consider her books a guilty pleasureuntil, well, yesterday. The word ""pleasure"" in that expression, though, baffled me very much even before. More correctly, reading her was an experience akin to getting your first period at school and noticing too late (mortallyembarrassing), while ranting about it later was an honest if inclement exercise in snark, just as reading other people\'s reviews with previous knowledge of the book was pure amusement, be them positive or negative, and this latter reason is probably what always convinced me to suffer a little for the greater fun. Sometimes I also enjoyed some parts, so mine wasn\'t all sadism, after all. ButA Court of Wings and Ruin? (I still have no clue about what this absurd title is supposed to mean.) This one wassheer torture.A bore. Like havinga pitchfork repeatedly shoved in the eyeballs.(I should refer you tomy review ofA Court of Mist and Fury, which already contains many, if not all, of the issues I had with this final installment too, because since I\'ve read that book with way more attention than I did ACoWaR, you\'d probably find that one more specific and generally accurate.)•The writing gets worse. It\'s a miracle -or whatever its opposite would be called. Saying that it\'smelodramaticdoesn\'t begin to describe it anymore; admitting that its basic rule isemotional manipulationwould be such an understatement, my fingers itch. Everything is amplified, everything is exaggerated, everything makes twice the noise that it should make proportionally to its dimensions. Which is to say,everything becomes grotesque.Ridiculousness abounds, especially when matters of the heart (you haveno ideahow much I struggled not to use some other word that would have been more fit to the case at hand there) are concerned. I\'ll make just two quick examples both taken from chapter 14.The examples may contain mild spoilers.“Where are my sisters?” The thought clanged through me, jarring as a pealing bell.Rhys paused, hand slipping from my hair as his smile faded. “At the House of Wind.” He straightened, swallowing—as if it somehow checked him. “I can—take you to them.” Every word seemed to be an effort.But he would, I realized. He’d shove down his need for me and take me to them, if that was what I wanted. My choice.It had always been my choice with him.”To spell it out, what Feyre\'s voice is implying here is that one point in the never-ending list of reasons why Rhysand is worth worshipping is that he is able to keep it in his pants ten minutes longer so that she can go say hello to her sisters, whom she hasn\'t seen in more than a month and who, last she saw them, had just undergone a devastating trauma. It is evident that Maas isstillshoving in our faces that wemustabsolutely love Rhysand... a pity she isstillpicking all the wrong reasons, because what I think when I read a scene like this is ""Someone please lock him away"" (and I\'m being kind).Example number two(trigger warning: this one\'s rather disgusting. I for sure gagged once or twice.), this oneto show what I mean by ""overwritten"" and ""grotesque"" and ""ew"":“You have a choice,” he murmured against my cheekbone. “Either I lick every inch of you clean …” His hand grazed the tip of my breast, circling lazily. As if we had days and days to do this. “Or you can get into the bath that should be ready by now.”I pulled away, lifting a brow. “Are you suggesting that I smell?”Rhys smirked, and I could have sworn my core pounded in answer. “Never. But …” His eyes darkened, the desire and amusement fading as he took in my clothes.“There is blood on you. Yours, and others’. I thought I’d be a good mate and offer you a bath before I ravish you wholly.”I huffed a laugh and brushed back his hair, savoring the silken, sable strands between my fingers. “So considerate. ThoughI can’t believe you kicked everyone out of the house so you could take me to bed.”“One of the many benefits to being High Lord.”“What a terrible abuse of power.”That half smile danced on his mouth. “Well?”“As much as I’d like to see you attempt to lick off a week’s worth of dirt, sweat, and blood…”His eyes gleamed with the challenge, and I laughed again. “Normal bath, please.”You see what I mean? Maas triesso hardto write steamy, sexy moments that she stopped noticing that the way she writes them became (a long time ago I dare say)utterly ridiculous. What sane person in their right mind would ever say ""I’d like to see you attempt to lick off a week’s worth of dirt, sweat, and blood off me?""Many, many,many, if not all, of the problems this book has are linked to the writing,silly,childish,bloated,cheesy. It sourseverything.•Not totally disconnected from this, there is also the insistence with whichFeyre\'s bliss with her Court of Friends and Familyis continually trotted out, especially if there\'s the opportunity to describe it through someone else\'s point of view, as it happens with Lucien\'s in the first part of the book.There is a reason if one of the axioms of storytelling is that talking about happiness is difficult: it\'s uninteresting, poor of nuances, syrupy: people don\'t want to hear about happiness. “Happy families are all alike,” after all.•One of the main points ofFeyre\'s character arcshould be her discovery of independence and of her inner strength, of the fact that she doesn\'t necessarily need anyone, especially a man, to guide and direct her every step. A shame the impression we get from the whole series isthe very opposite: Feyre\'s character growth (not automatically meant as an upward trajectory) seems to be irreversiblyconnected to the ""male"" who is (even virtually) at her side. In this book, she and Rhysand are pretty much a single entity. Can I feel a tinge of outrage at this, please? We women are very able to be complete on our own, thank you very much. The whole""mating system"" (I can\'t even, it\'s too ridiculous)has me not exactly convinced in this regard too. Various characters throughout the book keep having this attitude, especially towards Feyre, that impliesa vision of women as mere objects of sexual interest, pawns in a purely male game of lust and authority, and they are never challenged because their brain is full of crap, but simply because they insult Feyre–and not even Feyre as herself, but Feyre as Rhysand\'s mate, like during the meeting of the High Lords in chapter 46, when someone calls Feyre ""human filth"" and Rhysand\'s reply is physical violence plus a laconic“Don’t ever,” Rhys said, hands sliding into his pockets, “speak tomy matelike that again.”Again, everything, even on the level of language, revolves around a man and the girl\'s relationship to said man. I fail to see the women\'s empowerment in this.•I\'ve never seensuch a cheesy ending. It feltlike I had just swallowed a monumental bucket of melted sugarand I couldn\'t even breathe because the very air got stuck to the sticky back of my throat. Basically it made me finally understand that Maas\'s main interest was to make sure none of her precious babies got so much as a scratch.➽ I was trying to find a way to be tactful and diplomatic about this, but there is none. The first book was nice and very entertaining, the second was still entertaining but way less nice,the third is ignoble. Bottom line:this series is crap.Don\'t read it(and if you know me and my reviews, you know Ineveronce recommendednotto read a book, nor do I think I shall ever do it again, because the fact that I don\'t like something doesn\'t mean that nobody would or should. Besides, I don\'t really believe in second-hand opinions. So the fact that I think this book will actively damage your brains and that I\'m warning you off it should really speak volumes in itself). There are far more worthy books out there waiting for you.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '3.75 stars""Rhys stepped off the stairs and took my hand.Night Triumphant—and the Stars Eternal.If he was the sweet, terrifying darkness, I was the glittering light that only his shadows could make clear.""It\'s the worst feeling in the world when finales don\'t match up to their predecessors.I likedA Court of Thorns and Roses, IlovedA Court of Mist and Fury, I am frankly disappointed byA Court of Wings and Ruin.First, the writing.It\'s in desperate need of another round of editing. It\'s unpolished, full of unnecessary repetition and lazy placeholder sentences.Maascanwrite. She\'s proved it over and over again, which makes ACOWAR seem almost criminal. I think the strain of writing two novels a year finally caught up with her. ACOTAR AND ACOMAF don\'t really count because they were written long beforeThrone of Glasswas published. All she had to do was clean up. But ACOWAR was written back-to-back withEmpire of Storms, which was a beefy number on its own.Fervent as I was for ACOWAR, I wouldn\'t have minded waiting another year if it meant getting quality content.Second is the ending.Rhys lives, Amren lives, everybody fucking lives.Where are the sacrifices? How it can possible that no one in this bloated main cast dies? (Don\'t you bloody dare point to Feyre\'s dad. He was barely a presence the entire series, and I remain firmly convinced Maas brought him back just to fill the death toll and shut up people like me.)I understand Rhys\'s resurrection—he\'s Feyre\'s mate and fan favorite and therefore too important to die—but Amren too? Her losing her godly power is not a sacrifice. She\'s still High Fae. Why not make her human? Why not have a human serve in the Night Court? Or why not have Cassian or someone else lose their wings? Quite a few reviewers (and me included) havementioned this already, but Maas undeniably has an obsession with inhumanly powerful characters.On the subject of Rhys, it would have been so, so cool for Feyre to be the sole ruler of the Night Court. The first High Lady in history. And it would have been a fitting end to her character arc. She was dependent on a man in the first book, was broken by the same man in the second, and then healed and made to see she could be powerful and independent by another man. In the third, she stands alone, back straight, strong and proud, without a man. Obviously I\'m oversimplifying things here, but you can\'t deny the pieces line up.Also, that deus ex machina army in the end. Oh, we\'re on the edge of losing! All is lost! BUT WAIT here\'s an army. And ANOTHER army!Another thing that bothered me is howunbelievably powerful Feyre is.There is feminism, which is an underlying theme for her character, and there is what-the-fuckery. Near the beginning of the book, she is able to take on two daemati (powerful fae) who have a thousand years of fighting experience over her. Later, after she accidentally ingests a drug that strips her of her powers, they still magically flare back to life to help her triumph over two seasoned High Fae fighters.Right, I think I\'ve bitched enough about the bad.Let\'s get to the good.I love the characters.The Inner Circle, Lucien, Nesta, Elain... they are a huge part why I rated ACOWAR as high as it is. Feyre and Rhys—in this book and this book only—aren\'t as interesting. Their story in terms of conflict was finished in ACOMAF and although I enjoy how Maas explores how normal couples argue and make up, I\'m not as invested in them as before. There are too many other stories begging to be told: Lucien\'s, Elain\'s, Nesta and Cassian\'s, Mor\'s, Tamlin\'s.Yes, Tamlin. This fandom is too hard on him—and too forgiving of Rhys. I will never forget what he did in ACOTAR. Yet because the story is filtered through Feyre\'s perspective, Rhys becomes a hero who makes mistakes and Tamlin becomes a monster who commits unforgivable sins. He genuinely thought the woman he loved had been abducted and was likely being tortured. I\'m not excusing his abusive behavior, but we have to remember he was suffering from PTSD too. He was trying to protect Feyre the best he could—just like Rhys by forcing Feyre to make that bargain with him way back in ACOTAR, fyi. Why does Rhys deserve dozens of free passes and not Tamlin?Hating the High Lord of Spring just because Feyre does is a disservice to the complexity of his character.I also like that Maas seems to bepulling away from the whole ""mates"" concept.Multiple characters within have strong romantic relationships without the mating bond, and those that do may not necessarily be right for each other.Much as I love the idea of Lucien and Elain, I get the feeling that she\'s setting them up for something different. Elain and Azriel, and Lucien and Vassa.The pacing is good, too.There aren\'t as many sex scenes as the previous book, which I was happy about, though not due to any misguided sense of propriety. I simply found myself bored reading about Rhys slamming his shaft up to the hilt or what not.Still lowkey mad the first thing Feyre did after coming back from the Spring Court is bang Rhys and not check on her traumatized sisters.While I liked them in ACOMAF, there are more important things going on here, like the war or the other courts.Final verdict? Bring on the spin-offs.My review of A Court of Thorns & RosesMy review of A Court of Mist & FuryMy review of A Court of Frost and StarlightMy review of A Court of Silver Flames'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I wish so much that I could tell you I loved this book... but I just didn\'t.After thinkingA Court of Mist and Furywas such a huge improvement fromA Court of Thorns and Roses, I was really excited for this third installment. I even preordered it. But I really struggled to get into the book from the very start. Frompacing issuestoawkward sex scenesthat did nothing for me, it was one disappointment after another.I\'ve said this before but I reallydislike Maas\'s sex scenes. At her best, she writes them strangely with words like ""branding"" and ""claiming"", but here they were just plain icky. With all the talk of ""mates"", ""growling"" and ""purring"", and the climaxing from stroking one another\'s wings, I felt like I\'d walked in on two animals rutting in the mud. Ugh.And another thing-- Feyre and Rhysand are already mated and loved up to their eyeballs so there wasno sexual tension, no will they/won\'t they, which made the sex scenes so boring.What\'s strange about these sex scenes is how they manage to somehow be both graphic and coy at the same time. Maas never actually uses explicit words. If a young kid picked up this book, they might assume Rhysand and Feyre were dancing or playing an instrument.His touch turned different. Exploring. Broad strokes and feather-light ones, arches and swirls and direct, searing lines.And her vagina is usually described as ""there"" or ""where I want him"". Then, at the same time, these scenes are weirdly overwritten, with her orgasm (obviously not called that) leaving her “skin glowing like a newborn star in its wake”. It\'s just really not my thing.I was disappointed with the writing in general, to be honest. Maas seemed to write a lot more ""tell"" and a lot less ""show"" than usual. I was especially disappointed at the wasted opportunity for some underhanded manipulation in the first part. After how the last book ended, Feyre was kind of ""undercover"" at the start and in a position for lies and sneakiness. Except it was mostly her swanning around and quietly seething to herself about how much she hated Ianthe and how much of a douche Tamlin is.I thought this whole part was boring when it should have been extremely tense and exciting.But I think the worst thing was the overall pacing. It\'s a long book, but I can normally sprint through Maas\'s works in a day, yet here it wassuch a slog. Especially the first half. It\'s taken up with a lot of character conversations and strategizing for the upcoming war with Hybern. It lacked a pull, a sense of urgency, some kind of tension to make me need to know what happens next.I cannot believe they\'ve announced anotherfour booksfor this series. Why??? I can only hope they are some kind of spin-off series because, otherwise, either a) we will have to suffer through who the fuck knows how many more awkward, unsexy Feyre/Rhysand sex scenes, or b) Maas will destroy Rhys\'s character and hook Feyre up with yet another hot fae dude. I\'m not sure which is more likely.The later chapters of this book picked up in pacing, but I think it wastoo little, too late. This is a whopping 700-page monster and it obviously didn\'t need to be. I will say that I liked how things were left with Tamlin, but seeing as that part was only a few sentences long, it doesn\'t make up for everything else.I\'m thinking this is where I drop out of this series.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Just published my latestBookTube Video- so excited to share it!The Written ReviewAfter that ending only one quote can adequately sum up my feelings:Something thumped in front of me.

Maasjuggles so many unique personalities- from the sweetest human to skin-crawling monsters - without them blending into caricatures (Every time, she astounds me with her creations).Herworld has such depththat I'm constantly amazed by the little, reoccurring details (I feel like I could walk the city of Velaris without being lost for a moment).Hercharacters feel real- their personas, their movement, their banter - I felt like they were right in front of me, rather than words on a page (how is it possible to fall in love with so many characters in one book?).I could not be more impressed right now.The 2018 POPSUGAR Reading Challenge - A past Goodreads Choice Awards winnerYouTube|Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Facebook| Snapchat @miranda_reads""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4 StarsBefore I say anything, I must say this:What the fuck is this ""vulgar gesture"" that has been mentioned over andoverand a-FUCKING-over again throughout all this series, which all the characters seem to gift each other with?No for real, I would love to know.Are they all giving each other a different ""vulgar gesture"" every time, or is it ONE single gesture.And if so, which one?This one?This one?How about this one?No?How about the ever tried and true?Or, perhaps, MY personal favorite:No?Well, whatever. I would love to know.Anynotawave, if you follow my reviews, you know that I didn\'t particularly love book one and two of this series like most people did. And, conversely, most people who adored books one and two seemed to be less...enthused with this book.So, of course, leave it to me to be the complete opposite of everyone else.Because, even though I wasn\'t OMG inlurvewith books one and two, I found myself really into this one.Maybe it just took books one and two to really dig my heels into the series - who knows - but I was really digging the characters in this one.Obviously, I loved the relationship between Feyre and Rhys...The group love and loyalty of the Night Court inner circle...And the connection between Feyre and her sisters...But - and I know this is not the case with most people - I am REALLY loving Nesta\'s story.I have been oddly drawn to her and her cold bitchiness since book one and I REALLY loved the growth she displayed in this book, the dynamic between her and Cassian, just everything.And of course, RHYS. Who can not love Rhys?In fact, this book actually made me really appreciate books one and two more.I might go back and read them again.But until then, I am looking forward to the next book in the series.And I also just obtained theThroneseries, so hopefully I will enjoy that one from the onset.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I’m wrecked.Becausea Court of Wings and Ruin was the BEST CONCLUSION I could ever hope for.I want to shoutTHANK YOU SJM for this incredible adventure. Thank you for letting us dream and travel across the stars if only for a short time.I have been a massive fan of the ACOTAR series since the first book so I was highly anticipating ACOWAR.I was afraid I wouldn’t like the third book as much as I loved the second one but hell, I was so wrong. I swear, I don't know how many nerve cells this book cost me.Not only is the book thrilling and well-written. But it added a lot more complexity than I'd expected. Both in the characters and the plot.The progression brings aboutso many new faces(Have five to Helion, my second favourite High Lord), each of them unique in their own way.When Feyre was in the Spring Court, she was so over-powered like she is a goodness and no one can stop her -I was getting some unwanted Aelin’s vibe here– butthe plot was pretty well-driven after that, allowing each character to have its share of glory in Hybern Battle. And thank god for incredible plot twists or else I would have died a thousand times.The other thing that I really enjoyed is the fact thatthe book was unpredictable. I got all emotional becausethe story has a way of being built up and simply torn down piece by piece by a certain event and you are like “What the hell just happened?” and then being rebuilt once again.I literally went mental in one of the last scene – YES, THIS SCENE –my parents were actually concerned because of my change of emotions. I cried during the emotional moments, I got stressed during the battle scenes, I laughed so hard in others, I blushed during the bold sexy scenes, but most of all,I had – and still have believe me - embarrassing fangirling moments over the characters.I have a lot of favourite scenes.Like a lot especially those where a potential couple interact –You should have seen me during NESSIAN SCENES, I was a FANGIRL MONSTER– butone scene particular brought me to tear and that was RHYS’s SPEECH BEFORE the FINAL BATTLE.Overall, it wasan EPIC BOOK closing an AMAZING trilogy with immensely ENTERTAINING STORYLINE, characters TO LOVE and a DETAILED fantasy WORLD.Very much worth your time.What are you waiting for?""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Yay!

I don't think I'm going to bother writing a review, simply because I wouldn't do it justice. Neither would it showcase how much it means to me. Other than to say that I feel this sense of loss and wonder that I felt when I finished reading Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. This series has become that ingrained in me. And I couldn't be more appreciative and grateful for these books. So, thank you, Sarah J Maas, our High Lady. 😆Thank you for creating such incredible characters that mean the absolute world to me and world I never wanted to leave. This is the exact reason why I read.ORIGINAL REVIEW:And I thought it couldn't get better than ACOMAF...Sarah J. Maas, my goddess of everything, you have obliterated me. Shattered my soul and healed it. Words will not do justice in me expressing how much I adore you, your books, and the extend of what this book means to me. The expectations I had for this book were met above and beyond and I think this book is part of your soul laid bare...I cannot recall crying this much over a book, ever. And now heart feels heavy and sick with love whilst simultaneously grieving over these characters, a set of characters and world I’m never going to forget.I cannot thank you enough for writing this story!*forever in a book hangover*""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Words fail me. I have always been more of a fan of Sarah J Mass fan, but more towards her Thrown of Glass series. I think this is her best book so far. This book just has everything. Great characters, great story, secrets, betrayal, redemptions, ACTION!!!! You name it, it is here. 700 pages and not a line wasted. Hell, I would have been happy with another 700 pages of this standard. The character are great, but there is such great character development that no one is one dimensional the character are conflicted and complex with their own strengths and issues. Every time I learned something about one of the characters, I wanted to know more. Every character had their moment to shine in this book, and every character in this book could very easily star in their own book. That is the depth of the character in this story. Espicallly Rhysand, and anyone in the Court of Dreams.Since the last book, Feyre has returned to the Spring Court to destroy it from within. This is not Feyre crushed by her truma, suffocated by overprotection, or the powerless girl in a world of monsters/guardians. This is the angry, powerful, deadly calculating woman. I like the fact that Rhysand is every bit her match. I am actually interested to see which of them is the more powerful. So far, with centuries of experience behind battle, tactics, and studies, he seems to be a step ahead, but time will tell. However even with all this going on War is coming to Prythian and with all the High Lords in agreement (with their history of grudges and betrayal this is next to impossible ), they are still way out numbered against the King of Hybern and the power of the Calderon. Once again, it falls to the Court of Dreams to lead the charge not only against their enemies but the very thinking of many Prythians as well.This is just an awesome book. I don't think you have to read the other book in the series to love this book, but I would definitely recommend reading the whole series, but I definitely read this one. The more I read, the more I wanted to read. It took me through every emotion, the anger of betrayal, the pride in overcoming adversity, to the election of victory. I honestly do not think SJM could fit anything more into this many pages.

Maas-ish in a way that did not surprise me but still made me terribly emotional. It wasn’t the ACOMAF-emotion, it wasn’t the EoS-emotion, it wasn’t the KoA-emotion, it wasn’t the HoEaB-emotion.This book has had its own emotion, I swear. It was tough, but somehow it was milder than the others previously named.Except for what happened on page 666.I cannot forgive that.I almost had both a heart attack and a stroke at the same time. And I am still not over it and I still feel like SJM pulling shit like this on me is exactly why I might need therapy.After the pure emotion of the previous book in the series,A Court of Wings and Ruinshows the final battle and all its raw and powerful emotions and actions. The dirty and the bad and the ugly – there are all of them there.This battle though is also freedom. No one is above scheming anymore. One must do everything they have in power to win because the cause is holy. There are sacrifices that must be made and plans that must be developed.This battle is also about unity and the book shows us how important this is. When there is a common goal at stake, then pride must be left outside when entering the war-tent. And true masters of war know that. Everyone must work together because victory is in the numbers.Aside from the compelling emotions that charge a book deeply powered by the promise of war, there is another facet of the plot.Thecharactersdiscover alter-egos, personalities that they did not know they had. Or they knew and they tried to reprimand them as hard as possible. Everyone has to overcome their own selves and that is a battle too.“It’s a rare person to face who they truly are and not run from it – not be broken by it.”Every character has their own secret that springs out with the tiniest occasion it gets to have. We see different angles of Cassian and Azriel, of Mor and Amren, of Nesta and Elain, of Tamlin and Lucien. They all fight two battles – of freedom and of self.Rhys and Feyre get to discover and unravel themselves too, but where Feyre finds her vengeful self, her strong and determined essence of a ruler, Rhysand shows us his vulnerable, soft side. The side that determined him to sacrifice himself to keep the ones he loved free.In this book, Rhysand is his ultimate selfless self. And honestly, nothing in this world would make me not love this hell of male.Sarah hit the jackpot with this gem, I’m telling you.If I had to get through absolutely every single emotion this book gave me then I’ll need something stronger than infused water to keep me going, a big cone of chocolate ice cream and probably a re-read of the whole ACOTAR series just to be sure I get everything right.I love how cunning and ruthless does SJM get when writing her books and even though sometimes there is no need for something like this, ACOWAR had to benefit from that. How else could such a mesmerising story end but in tears of frustration and raw feelings, I’m asking you?I honestly fell so hard for this series it became one of the things I think I’ll love in my life forever and ever. Glad I could read it and right now, writing this sorry of a review, I am considering so hard re-reading all of the books because damn, this helps my mental health in so many weird ways I can’t even seem to understand it myself.If you haven’t read the beauty of the ACOTAR series, please just go for it. Your life will be complete and you’ll probably thank me later ;)“Maybe one day, when the earth had grown old and died, when the stars had vanished, too…maybe then, we would return to this place.”'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4.25/5 stars""Remember that you are a wolf. And you cannot be caged.""I want to print off a picture of this cover and keep it in my wallet. Just in case anyone asks me if I have children, I can just show them this.Because all these assholes are my children.I don’t even know where to start with this review. I’ve been writing things and then deleting them for weeks. Every combination of words just isn’t therightcombination I need to right the perfect review.Sarah J. Maasalways releases not one, but two gigantic books a year and I don’t even know how to write a thousand word review? Actual proof that SJM is a writing goddess. We have been blessed from the heavens.So anyways, I\'ve decided to write whatever the hell comes to my head. So this entire review is one huge train wreck. It\'s an unorganized mess. I\'m gonna apologize for that right now. It also contains unmarked spoilers because it is almost three thousand words long and I don\'t have time to go through and mark every single spoiler.ACOWAR had the unfortunate luck of having to proceed the epicness that was A Court of Mist and Fury. It’s like being given $1,000,000, spending it all, then being given only a $100,000. Both amounts of money are nice to have, but obviously the million is the better option. Or like watching Beyonce perform live in concert, then having to watch a youtube video of Beyonce. Both are nice, great options, but there is always going to be the preferable one. I actually feel sorry for ACOWAR. It didn’t deserve to be a follow-up toA Court of Mist and Fury, but it really didn’t have an option. ACOWAR is better than ,A Court of Thorns and Rosesbut if you were to look up the definition of “prefection” in the dictionary, there will be a picture of the ACOMAF cover.Let me just get some of my thoughts & feels written down real quick. Beware, some might be spoilery. Please proceed with caution.A COURT OF THOUGHTS & FEELS1. Rhys is actually the best fictional character ever and I love him2. Feyre is actually the best fictional character ever and I love her3. Mor is actually the best fictional character ever and I love her4. Lucien is actually the best fictional character ever and I love him5. Amren is actually the best fictional character ever and I love her6. Azriel is actually the best fictional character even and I love him7. Cassian is actually the best fictional character ever and I love him8. Tamlin is actually the worst fictional character ever and I hate him9. I hate him so much10. Seriously11. Who okay’d Tamlin as a character?12. They should be fired13. Ianthe sucks too14.I’m glad that bitch got destoryed by the weaver15. We could have done without the sex scenes though.16. Remember when they were in the library? And all they wanted to do was have sex and not read. Talk about unrealistic.17. Rhys is the most dramatic character in YA…...pass it on18. The beginning, when Feyre was at the Spring Court, was actually my favorite part of the entire book? I loved it.19. I was just like yaaas Feyre girl you destroy those losers20. Also when Feyre and Rhys were reunited that was cool21. I wanted that scene to be longer though with a lot less sex22.Also the Suriel’s death was not okay’d by me and Sarah will be hearing from my lawyers23. Also who approved the term “vulgar gesture???” They should be fired too.24. Also if I ever hear the word ""mate"" again I\'m gonna spontaneous combust25. Cassian + Feyre = A friendship you will never have26. Mor is gay and all is okay27.Also no one in the night squad died which is really unrealistic to me? Also kinda disappointing. I was preparing myself for a death that never came, which took time away from me preparing my funeral.28. Also Amren is the best thing to come out of this book29. If the sequels aren’t about her I’m sueing.30. Also does anyone know why we were fighting this war? I don\'t remember.31. And also does anyone remember how the high lord powers work and why they all happen to be the most powerful people their courts but they get their position through genetics? Because if I haven\'t learned anything from YA literature, at least I\'ve learned that there will always be a chosen one who\'s more powerful than any ruler. So why hasn\'t that happened?CHARACTERS! cHARACTERSFeyre.Feyre is the best? She has evolved so much since the first book. And she\'s so loyal to those she loves. But if she hates you, you are dead. There is no way to save you.Rhys.I don\'t know if you knew this, but in certain countries it\'s agaisnt the law to hate Rhys. He\'s the best.Tamlin.Remember that time when you used to like Tamlin? Hahahaha he\'s an asshole.Mor.She\'s gay! Which is also the only diversity we got in this book.But she\'s the best.Amren.I want to be her when I grow up. She\'s the best.Lucien.I am just so glad that Lucien found God in this book.Cassian.I just love Cassian? I just want him to wrap me up in his wings. He\'s the best.Azriel.I would leave my boyfriend Kaz for Azriel. He\'s the best.SUMMARY AND COMMENTARYI’m going to do something I never done before in a review. There are so many scenes that I just want to talk about, that I’m gonna summarize a lot of this book so I can talk about them. This entire thing is spoilery so please don\'t read unless you\'ve read the book.So we start off athellthe Spring Court and Tamlin is being is douchebag self like always. He’s just hanging around, doing his meninist things. Not realizing that Miss High Lady of the Night Court over there is slowly taking down his court.A nightmare, I’d told Tamlin.Iwas the nightmare.I was kinda hoping for more telepathic interactions? I wanted Feyre to say something like, “Oh Rhys was just terrible to me.” and Rhys to just pop up and be like, “Terribly good in bed.” or something like that. But that never happened. SJM really threw away her shot.Hamilton would be disappointed.I’m going to be honest here. I didn’t really understand how Feyre took down the Spring Court? Like I know she did it by gaining the people’s trust. But I didn’t understand that sunlight scene or all the uneventful trips to the wall. Also Ianthe didn’t die in the first part which was disappointing. BUT IANTHE DOES GET HER HAND SMASHED INTO LITTLE PIECES BY FEYRE WHICH IS SO FREAKING BRUTAL I screamed the entire time like wow I don’t like the bitch either but did she really deserve to have her hand continuously smashed? I am a good person who has morals and part of me is still like “yeah she deserved that”Anyways Feyre is eventually like #byelosers @ the Spring Court and leaves. She takes Lucien with her which is really cool because Lucien deserved better than those assholes. So Lucien and Feyre flee the Spring Court, which at this point is burning.In fact I have an actual, never before seen picture of the spring court taken shortly after Feyre leftSome stuff happens and there\'s fighting because it’s a high fantasy novel and not having any fighting would probably make it a contemporary or something. But anyhow, Cassian eventually comes and helps Feyre and Lucien with the fighting. And the Cassian/Feyre reunion is the best reunion in this book? Like what Feyre/Rhys reunion?I met those laughing, fierce hazel eyes.Cassian’s smile softened. “Hello, Feyre.""My throat tightened to the point of pain, and I threw my arms around his neck, embracing him tightly.“I missed you, too,” Cassian murmured, squeezing me.Honestly, that scene was the absolute best? Like after that, the Feysand reunion was so underwhelming. It happened just a few pages later but it wasn’t cute dialogue and hugs and ***friendship*** Their meetup was crying on the floor then having unnecessary explicit sex.SJM is great and all, but her sex scenes are the worst. I understand that sex is a thing that exist and Feysand participates in it, but I just don’t care about the details. I would rather have more Amren dialogue.So at one point during all this reunion sex, Feyre tells Rhys that he likes a dramatic entrance which has just won an oscar for “understatement of the year”. Because obviously, Rhys did not crash Feyre’s wedding in ACOMAFThe next part of the book is just like plotting and stuff. It’s kind of boring. I honestly almost fell asleep during the next two hundred pages? I mean I didn’t though because this is a SJM book but I could have. There was no action. No suspense. At least I had Amren and her I-don’t-give-a-shit attitude to keep me awake.There is the library scene which is the worst scene in the entire book. So Feyre and Rhys are in this gigantic ass library surrounded by books which is like life goals right? If you don’t want to be surrounded by books then gtfo of my review. But anyways, instead of appreciating the luxuries they have in their life, Feyre and Rhys spend the entire time flirting with each other? This annoyed me so much. It was the most unrealistic scene in this entire series. I don’t care if my High Lord mate was there with me. If I was in a library surrounded by books, then he doesn’t freaking exist in that moment.Also there is a giant monster thing that lives in the basement of this library that everyone is afraid of? #goals“If you hadn’t stolen my bride away in the night, Rhysand, I would not have been forced to take such drastic measures to get her back.”I said quietly, “The sun was shining when I left you.”So Rhys and Feyre and the rest of the squad decided to throw a party. By party I mean, they decided to get all the incredibly powerful, opinionated fae in one place and try to come to an agreement. This is such a smart idea. Just wow. They also invite Tamlin to be nice and then they act surprised when he shows up??? Like you guys sent him an invite to your birthday party??? It would be rude of him not to come???? Why would he turn down free cake like that?!?!?!Tarquin took him in. Then me. And the others. “I rescind the blood rubies. Let there be no debts between us.”“Don’t expect Amren to return hers,” Cassian muttered. “She’s grown attached to it.”So the greatest thing ever happened during this meeting? And I’m not talking about when Feyre destroyed Tamlin when he was being a prick. No, I’m talking about how Amren isn’t returning her ruby that marks her for death? She’s so iconic. I want to be Amren when I grow up.Then, while all these high lords were in the same place and wasting time fighting with each other,donald trumpthe King ofHybitchHyburn brings down the wall that they were all tryingnot sodesperately to protect. And again, they were all surprised.Like are you fUCKing kidding me? How did you not see this coming???? You are standing around, doing pratically nothing. Wasting all the time in the world. AND YO UARE SUPRISED THAT HYBITCH IS ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH WITH HIS PLANS. YOU KNOW HE WAS TRYING TO BRING THAT WALL DOWN. he WAS GONNA DO IT AND YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY WAS THE PERFECT OPPURTUNITY. Honestly, I am surprised he didn’t succeed earlier than this?So noW that the wall has been destroyed and is never coming back, all these high lords realized that if they are going to win this war, they are gonna all get off their asses to do something.Also what even are we fighting for? All I know about this war is that the King of Hyburn is bad and the Night Court Squad is good. How did this war even start? What did Amarantha have to do with anything? Who even is Myriam person and what does she have to do with anything? I know it was probably explained in ACOMAF but that was a year ago and I was too busy placing my attention on Rhys to pay any attention. So at this point I’m 469 pages into the last book of this trilogy and I don’t even know what we are fighting for? I’m emotionally invested in a war I know nothing about. Is this what politics are like?Anyways, the squad and their newly found high lord allies go to take down Hybitch.So then Feyre has this brilliant idea to go find out good friend the Suriel. I forgot the Suriel even existed tbh. He’s so creepy that I am sure my brain purposely block him out from my ACOTAR memories. So we go find Mr. Suriel and he is near the Weaver’s cottage.I also blocked the weaver out from my memories so, if you are like me, this is when you bust open your ACOTAR coloring book, flip to the picture of the Weaver, and then pretend to remember.So the Suriel is kinda helpful but unhelpful as always. But Feyre still cares about him becasue why would’t you care about the creepy monster that doesn’t even have a proper name and you\'ve only met like three times? So Suriel, that unhelpful yoda, is in the middle of giving Feyre vague advice when THAT BITCH IANTHE SHOWS UP AND JUST SHOOTS HIM WITH AN ARROW FOR NO GOOD REASON. Obviously having a crushed hand hasn’t affected her aim any.Someone should just kill that bitch already. Which is exactly what Feyre does. And she isn’t even easy on her. She takes Ianthe into the Weaver’s cottage and the weaver like eats her. Gross. I would have atleast chosen a less graphic demise. And something that kills her a lot longer.How fortunate are we that we caught the impossible-to-catch Suriel for the third time right near the cottage of a monster thing that likes to eat bitches? We are soooo fortunate.“Feyre Archeron,” the Suriel said again, gazing at the leafy canopy, the sky peeking through it. A painful inhale. “A request.”I leaned close. “Anything.”Another rattling breath. “Leave this world...a better place than how you found it.”So after murdering Ianthe, Feyre goes back to the dying Suriel and I haveThe Hunger Gamesflashbacks to Rue’s death scene. I was kind of expecting Feyre to gather flowers to place around the Suriel. And obviously, even though we are in a world surrounded by magic, there is no way to save the Suriel. He dies. I’m devastated. You are devastated. I still vaguely remember the Suriel from the past two books.And if I’m honest, this all could have been avoided if Feyre wasn’t so dramatic and just asked the Suriel to coffee or something.Oh also, I just happened to have stumbled upon this picture of Feyre that was taken one time after someone was shocked she caught the SurielMore stuff I don’t care about happens blah blah blah and then Feyre’s sister, Elain, is somehow kidnapped by the cauldron.Also making a cauldron the most powerful object in all the universe is the stupidest thing I’ve ever read.How did the Cauldron kidnap Elain? I don’t know it is never really explained how that inanimate object does anything. Remember, I still don’t know why the crap we are at war here. Anyways, Feyre gets really upset so she goes undercover as Ianthe and infiltrates the Hyburn army and saves Elain. Feyre goes through maybe one obstacle along the way and then returns to her mate Rhys.Also, if you are a person who participates in drinking games, then here’s a fun one for you while you read the book. Every time the word “mate” is said you drink. And get drunk during the first chapter. You\'ll be in the hospital by the third chapter. So actually don’t play that drinking game.And was I the only person who felt this entire thing was so unneeded? This is a 700 page book and we are nearing the end and now we are going on missions that run a little too smoothly? Like I know Azriel gets hurt but he’ll heal perfectly fine because we live in a world of healing magic that works on bat wings but not bitch’s hands.More fighting. There is a lot of fighting that happens. It’s like they are at war or something.Oh remember Feyre’s father? Yeah, I don’t either. But he comes back. I didn’t know he was gone but he came back with ships named after his daughters and Odette fromSwan Lakebut instead of a Swan, she’s a firebird which might just be a stupid name for a phoenix, oh and he name isn’t Odette. Anyways, her father finds this queen they just happened to be looking for even though there’s no way he could have possibly known that because he has been missing for 37297843 years. So obviously, because of this all his past sins are forgiven instantly. Then her father eventually dies because ofTrumpHybitch and we are suppose to be sad about it but I’m still standing here likeThen, on page 666, because Sarah is in fact the devil, the unthinkable happens. MY BABY RHYS WHO IS SUPPOSE TO BE PROTECTED AT ALL TIMES DIES. YES DIES. AND AT THIS POINT I’M CRYING IN THE CORNER AND WANTING TO THROW THE BOOOK INTO A VOLCANOAnd I’m just like, “If he ficking stays dead then at least all 700 pages of this book will make great kindling to warm my now cold heart”But then I remember ACOTAR and how Feyre here died and then was brought back to life so I start looking at the other high lords who happen to be near us at this moment and I’m just “Hey do a girl a favor here AND BRING BACK MY BOYFRIEND.”But then I also remember there’s a certain asshole who is also a high lord who has to help and I Start FREAKING out but then he comes through and he’s just like “Be happy, Feyre,” and SAVES RHY’S LIFEYou still an asshole Tam, but maybe just a little bit less.ANd I’m just crying in the corner even harder than before.Then somehow they defeat the King of Hybitch and Feyre and Rhys live happily ever after. Both are alive. The #NightSquad is still alive. Beause that is super realistic.Looks like the only person who is dead here is me. Oh well.CONCLUSIONSo while ACOMAF is still the best, this is still a great novel and I loved it? Being with all my children again is all I have ever asked for in life and I \'m just glad that they all ended up happy.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '4.8/5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️“Only you can decide what breaks you, Cursebreaker. Only you.”Let me talk to you about this book. This bookKILLED ME. This bookDESTROYED ME. This bookANNIHILATED ME. This bookOBLITERATED ME. This bookELIMINATED ME. This bookWIPED ME OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH. This bookEXTERMINATED ME. This bookERADICATED ME. I will never recover. How can I function after this fucking book? I was supposed to read it slowly becauseA Court of Frost and Starlightwill arrive here after a week and I have had serious issues waiting for those books in the past, but I couldn\'t stop. The last 300 pages were marvelous, they gripped me by the balls and took me with them on this amazing journey. I was reading till6amyesterday. No regrets. The feels are always heightened this ungodly time of day. And I\'m so happy I read this book at that time. But let\'s start from the very beginning.Looming war threatens all Feyre holds dear in the third volume of the #1 New York Times bestselling A Court of Thorns and Roses series.Feyre has returned to the Spring Court, determined to gather information on Tamlin\'s manoeuvrings and the invading king threatening to bring Prythian to its knees. But to do so she must play a deadly game of deceit – and one slip may spell doom not only for Feyre, but for her world as well.As war bears down upon them all, Feyre must decide who to trust amongst the dazzling and lethal High Lords – and hunt for allies in unexpected places.This book started off strong enough. I was extremely excited about Feyre infiltrating Tamlin\'s Court and taking him down. She would be such a badass. I expected this part of the book to be bigger, to be honest. About 250 pages, to be exact. I really enjoyed the scheming, the planning, the cleverness of Feyre, how she turned everyone against one another so brilliantly. I hated Tamlin and Ianthe more in this part of the book, obviously. They were both manipulative, controlling and toxic. They truly deserved each other. Lucien gained some respect from me in this part of the book. I was really disappointed in him inA Court of Mist and Fury.Afterwards, the pace of the book gets a bit slower than I would have wanted. I expected it to happen, because the ""format"" of these books is always the same, for me at least. A very powerful beginning, then the pace lags a little bit and in the end the trueBAM! But it was different for me in this book. I didn\'t feel the same excitement its predecessor gave me (till page 400). And I understand why. The previous book opened up a whole entire different world to me. From the Spring Court and everything we thought we knew was right, everything changed. And we start off getting to know everything in the Night Court, and it was all exhilarating. As much and even more as it was getting to know the entire world of everything in the first book. Getting to know Rhysand and his true incentives, the inner circle, the world, seeing the romance bloom between Rhysand and Feyre. In this book, everything is settled. We know everyone, the world, the romance is stable. There aren\'t as many new things happening, except when we get to page 400. Till this page, I would have given this book 4 stars, which is low for this series for me, because I LIVE FOR IT.I\'m going to talk a bit about the first 400 pages, before my favorite part of the book starts. After Feyre arrived in the Night Court with Lucien, everything took a certain pace. We got to feel Velaris again, the inner circle, Rhysand, the conflict, the problems. A gargantuan War is coming, and they had to deal with it. Gather allies, forge a plan, make actions, bargains. This entire chunk of the book was about the war and how they would end it. And I truly enjoyed that but it didn\'t keep me on my toes, you know? Till page 400.PAGE 400. THAT\'S WHERE THE REAL SHIT STARTS. And then we got to page 400. When the meeting starts. This is the part I couldn\'t leave the book down. The part where if anyone commanded me to leave the book down, I would have killed them. Like fucking Feyre would. This meeting was so enthralling. The tension was keeping me enraptured the entire time. I\'m content that we got to know the other High Lords of Prythian, we got a better understand of the world and its people. They were all truly incredible characters (except Beron), especially Helion. I loved his humor, his swag and that he\'s bisexual. I noticed something very important in this book. There was more representation. Not enough but more. We got to see black characters, bisexual characters, gay characters, lesbian characters (MOR I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, I\'M SO PROUD OF YOU GIRL). This series isn\'t known for its diversity, but it was nice to see some more examples popping up. It was refreshing.But anyway, let\'s continue with the meeting. I was so proud of all my Night Court babies, how they handled it. Each question a challenge that was met brilliantly.IF I COULD I WOULD STAND UP AND APPLAUD AZRIEL FOR ATTACKING ERIS. FUCKING ERIS.And also my Queen Feyre, who showed her true powers without fear of the High Lords. Of so many High Lords, who could easily kill her. And then Tamlin enters the Dawn Court room. I thought there was a limit to how much I hated him, but he surpassed that. His crude, distasteful and inappropriate comments were so unnecessary. Dude, we know how fucking butthurt you are that your girlfriend left you for a better man than you, but we\'re here to discuss how to prevent the War, your comments are fucking irrelevant. Be a better man for once and show some restraint. Now wonder even Lucien left you. Lucien. Oh man. Helion is Lucien\'s father. I was so fucking astonished. This book bestowed many plot twists for us, and this was one that gripped me tightly. I don\'t even know the reason, I just really like Lucien all of a sudden. More than I liked him in the first book. And I genuinely appreciated how he trusted Feyre, and how he acclimated himself to the Night Court. How he saw good in Rhysand and his people, after all the propaganda of the latest hundreds of years. How he wanted to be useful and help do something significant for the War.I WANT TO DISCUSS HOW FEYRE IS SUCH A SHIPPER, IT HURTS. Feyre is like us. She ships her friends with each other and tries to make the ship happen. I\'m so proud of her. I\'m so proud that she actively participates in her friend\'s happiness. She ships everything I ship, and I couldn\'t not notice it, it\'s so obvious. I want her to succeed. I want her to find the best fucking girlfriend for Mor, cause my girl deserves happiness. They all deserve it, but her more, in the relationship factor. I\'m very sorrowful that in this world, a lesbian woman can\'t thrive. It mirrors our own world, to be exact. Some people have the resources and the family behind to support them, and some people just, don\'t. Mor has been so unlucky in the romance department, with her cruel family stopping everything that she does. I want her to come out, and I want Feyre to be beside her and support her.I WANT TO TALK ABOUT NESTA AND CASSIAN. NESTA AND CASSIAN. The ship I was rooting for since the previous book. The ship that is killing my heart slowly and painfully.THEY HAVE TO BE MATES. PLEASE TELL ME THEY\'RE MATES. And even if they\'re not, their dynamic is so strong. Their scenes so utterly powerful, even them staring at each other had me dying in my seat. I want them to thrive. They are my favorite couple, after Rhysand and Feyre, and I want them to prosper. There was such a gradual progress with them. Sarah handled this couple\'s dynamic amazingly. How we started seeing, little by little, how Nesta started caring more about Cassian. How gentle he was with her, with her feelings. He didn\'t push her, he didn\'t drive her to the edge. I want more of them, I want them to take over the world. Nesta is such a favorite character of mine. Strong, unyielding, snarky, flawed, raw, true. She is perfectly flawed, the way I like my characters to be. This book series doesn\'t favor flawed characters. Most of them are impeccable, outside and inside. But Nesta isn\'t. She still shows her humanity and I love her for it.We talked about Nesta... now we have to talk about Elain. Useless, needless Elain. I didn\'t like her in this book. I loathed her moping around, her extremely extravagant sensitivity, her outmost obsolescence. I couldn\'t stand everyone defending and protecting her, all the fucking time. Oh poor little Elain, how bad must it be for you to be immortal, young and beautiful forever, aw I feel so sorry for you. She didsomethingin the end by stabbing The Hybern King, but not something miraculous. Nesta integrated the action. I just didn\'t enjoy her character in this book, she was utterly annoying to me.This War man... this War. It was the most tit gripping thing I have read in a very long time. The adrenaline was high up in heaven. It was jaw dropping, breathtaking, awe-inspiring. When the hope was lost, there would be hope, and when there was hope, it would be taken harshly out of our grip. There was so much shit happening, so many characters appearing, to help, to condemn. Strategies being thrown our the window, plans succeeding, failing, bargains breaking. There was just.. so much happening. I couldn\'t keep track of everything. The action was astounding, the plot twists out of this world, the thrill spectacular. I devoured these chapters in a heartbeat. I wasn\'t even looking at the pages or chapters, or even time, I was just reading. This book was a true and amazing ending to an incredible series. I\'m so happy I picked these books up. This series made me love fantasy again. I have stopped being a fan of fantasy for many many years, and these books reintroduced me to its virtues.I WANT TO READ MORE FANTASY BECAUSE OF THESE BOOKS YEAH.RHYS\'S DEATH GUYS. It happened in page666, how convenient. I didn\'t feel a heartbeat for a minute. I know he would survive because he\'s in the next book, but you know how it is. I was utterly heartbroken by Feyre\'s reaction. She made me feel what she was feeling. I cried. Literally. And hear me out a bit. This is a huge deal for me. I never cry with books. The only books I have ever cried about are theHarry Potterseries and theOutlanderseries. Which are my all time favorite books of all the fucking universe. When I started crying, I was so surprised at myself. I was so happy I did. Because Rhys has become one of my all time favorite characters, and seeing his demise broke me. Like Feyre\'s heart was broken. And then Tamlin gives his last speck of light and saves him. Let\'s talk about him and his redemption arc.You have seen my feelings about him in the fist part of this review. In the end, they shifted, just a bit. I truly appreciated how he helped Feyre, how he saved her. And how he saved Rhysand\'s life. I don\'t like him, but I value how he got over his grudge, and actually helped everyone, for the good of Prythian. I forgive you, Tamlin, you\'re still a piece of shit of a character with many unsolved issues, but as Feyre said“I hope you find happiness, too.\'""And I did. Not just for what he\'d done for Rhys, but...Even for an immortal, there was not enough *time* in life to waste it on hatred. On feeling it and putting it into the world.So I wished him well -- I truly did, and hoped that one day...One day, perhaps he would face those insidious fears, that destructive rage rotting away inside him.”You get a pass, bitch. I\'m curious of what will happen to his relationship with Lucien. It will be interesting.I have written 12000 words for this review. And 8000 are left. I will surpass Goodread\'s character limit. Lmao. I had so much to say about this book, the ending of a marvelous series. I couldn\'t help myself and I\'m very sorry for this chaos of a review. My feels are still raw and unedited. And if you\'re reading this right now, you\'re a true hero for going through all of this shittone. And I love you for it.To sum it all up, this book was a truly magnificent journey and an incredible ending to a wonderful series. I\'m literally speechless, and I will think about this book a lot. For a very long time. Nothing else more I can say, this review explains it all. I will crawl now to my bed and die peacefully of the feels. And till the next one... K BYE!7500 characters left out of 20000.LMFAO.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5/5 ✧･ﾟ: *""I would have waited five hundred more years for you. A thousand years.""This was the easiest 5 stars of my life, and for sure my favourite book in the series. I wish I could attach the video of me hysterically crying. I felt so much for this story, world and characters. So many things like tugged my heart strings, whilst being whimsical at the same time. I laughed and cried - this was just sooooo good. Getting into fantasy is really hard sometimes but this made it so easy. ⋆˙⟡♡╰┈➤PlotI think this book is a lot more plot focused than ACOMAF. They\'re dealing with strained political bonds with a devastating war on the horizon. It was so cool to see the other courts and all their personalities, how they all had their own stories that tie in with our main characters. As a certified romance hater, this was much more my style. There is stilla lotof romance to swoon for, between multiple characters and it was just *chef\'s kiss*.I will not stop talking about found family - these moments were responsible for me crying my eyes out.╰┈➤CharactersPersonally,Feyrewas a lot more likeable in this book. Less whining, more protective sister, protective family member. She\'s still not perfect and buts her nose into situations which I feel like she shouldn\'t, but it didn\'t make me dislike her, it\'s just a flaw. She has some very epic and real adventurous moments in this, and her anointment asHigh Lady of the Night Courtonly made me like her more.Rhysand, what a sweetheart. I love him to bits, he\'s soft on the inside but a bit of a powerful arrogant cheeky guy on the outside. He\'s sooooo sweet to Feyre and as someone who loveswords of affirmationI found him so loveable. He loves his family so deeply and that is represented further in this book. I loveCassianmore though. He\'s like a man man, also my style, but has a very soft spot for a girl. So adorable.BothNestaandElainmade me fall in love with them. They\'re so different, and they developed differently during this story, but the outcome was still the same. Nesta was starting to get on my nerves at one point because she\'s a bitice coldbut it grows on you, as it grows on a particular Illyrian warrior. I love the fact that they both have a special power that contributes to their overall adventure/mission. I\'m so excited to see them more in the next book. 𓍢ִ໋🌷͙֒╰┈➤World/SettingListen - this world was beautifully painted. The characters in this were painted so vividly, I could imagine each of them and they were all beautiful. As we see a lot more of the different courts, we see how different they are, both in attitude and visual representation, which was so well done. I could see Autumn court, Summer court, Winter court, Day & Dawn, and it\'s just so cool. I can\'t decide which one I would like to live in more, but I\'m leaning towards Winter.╰┈➤PacingSomething was always happening, there was always something to be interested in, laugh at, or cry at. There were some really tense moments at the ends of chapters that kept me hooked and this is a looooong book (703 pages). My ADHD struggled at times, but that doesn\'t reflect the story.╰┈➤EnjoymentAs you probably can tell, I enjoyed this so much. Like so so much. I felt the characters, was invested in the story, kept wanting to read it. Personally the story had everything I wanted, found family, epic battles and high stakes. So good.╔═════ ❀•°❀°•❀ ═════╗score card:plot: 5/5characters: 5/5world/setting: 5/5pacing: 5/5enjoyment: 5/5total: 5/5ੈ✩‧₊˚╚═════ ❀•°❀°•❀ ═════╝₊˚⊹♡ reading log09/05 9:30am ୨ৎgod damn I hate tamlin so much I hate the spring court so much what a sad sad man09/05 6:53am ୨ৎazriel and mor are positively killing me08/05 6:50am ୨ৎdid i get up at 6am to keep reading this? yes. is something awful about to go down in the story? yes.07/05 8:10pm ୨ৎi love this world, i love reading about these characters i love them all in their own unique way - but MAN this is long and my adhd cannot handle it - azriel is my favourite character so far, nesta\'s coldness is getting a little on my nerves but I\'m sure its for a reason07/05 4:31pm ୨ৎnesta be like 🥶🥶🥶05/05 8:35pm ୨ৎoh good i\'ve already cried, found family is my biggest weakness i can\'t05/05 6:44pm ୨ৎgod this book is long so much has happened and im only 13% of the way in05/05 12:02pm ୨ৎtamlin is stupid₊˚⊹♡ pre-readingit\'s tiimmeeeeee!! i\'ve been DYING to know how this is going to play out i\'m so excited the last one had me in an emotional ball on the floor - i expect nothing less from this one (although i know the second one is most people\'s favourite).i\'m so excited to see more of nesta and elain!! and of course everyone\'s favourite book boyfriend, rhysand.✦\u3000\u3000\u3000.\u3000\u3000. \u3000\u2008˚\u3000.\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 . ✦\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000˚\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 . ★⋆..\u2002\u2002 \u3000\u3000˚\u3000✭\u3000 \u3000\u3000*\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000✦\u3000\u3000\u3000.\u3000\u3000.\u3000\u3000\u3000✦\u3000˚ \u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u2008˚\u3000.˚\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000✭\u3000.\u3000\u3000. \u3000\u2008˚\u3000.\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 ✦may tbr:ಇ.salt to the seaಇ. powerlessಇ. house of earth and bloodಇ. everyone in my family has killed someoneಇ. brideಇ. listen for the lieಇ. she\'s not sorryಇ. love on the brainಇ. the familiarಇ.a court of wings and ruin'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""symptoms - sweaty palms, increased heart rate, calling everyone'mate.'diagnosis - rhysand withdrawals.treatment - rereading this book.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'A Court of Wings and Ruinis the third book in the ACOTAR series by Sarah J. Maas, and it\'s wild. The book starts with Feyre spying on the Spring Court for Rhys, pretending to be Tamlin\'s faithful wife again so she can undermine his Court from the inside.I absolutely adored the first part of the book. I love how clever Feyre was, setting up the destruction of the Spring Court while no one knew what she was planning. The way she tricked Tamlin was gold.After she returns to the Night Court, war breaks out between Hybern and Prythian. She goes on a quest to find the Cauldron, an ancient source of magic that might just stop the war. But not all of the Courts are willing to help her, and she will have to call on other magical creatures and forces to aid her in her search.I didn\'t like this part of the book as much. It felt very aimless to me, and drawn out for so long that the plot points lost all meaning. I wasn\'t bored, exactly, but the plot just feltwrongto me, as if something were missing. It was pretty straightforward in the beginning—find the Cauldron, destroy Hybern—but then a bunch of subplots were introduced. Feyre had to make deals with spirits and gods, she had to avoid Hybern—it was just... a lot, and yet too little at the same time. What do I mean by ""too little?"" Well...The pacing was dreadful. That doesn\'t mean I was bored.The plot built up far too quickly. Unlike inThrone of Glass,where the plot built gradually and climaxed in KoA, the plot here came out of nowhere. The villain, the King of Hybern, was so one-dimensional and uninteresting. His motives didn\'t make sense, the little history that was thrown in was so random and didn\'t help make him a better character at all, and his death was so unsatisfying. The character who killed him... well, I\'m not going to spoil it, but I don\'t think they were the right character to do the job. See the spoilery section for more on that.This series would have been better as just a regular romance, without all this...plot.I only really cared about the Inner Circle anyway. If it were just a faerie romance with great side characters and a found family, I would. Not. Care. That\'s all I want. Adding a whole epic plotline to the story just drags it down. I much preferred the more introspective ACOMAF.I really, really loved Feyre in ACOMAF, and now? Not so much. She has too many powers. She can do everything the High Lords can and more. I love how she\'s the first High Lady, but honestly, she has every power and it gets annoying when she can do basically anything.However, there are still times when I like Feyre more than Aelin. She\'s more mild and less overbearing, and I like that in a protagonist. She\'s persistent when she needs to be, and determined to learn. She understands the meaning of responsibility.Rhys before the mating bond is superior to Rhys after the mating bond. For one, he was less protective in the beginning of ACOMAF versus ACOWAR. I\'m tired of overprotective, aggressive male characters. I miss the Rhysand of ACOMAF, the one with a sharp sense of humor and patient respect for Feyre. He still has some of the traits he exhibited earlier, but they\'re dimmed in the face of his overpoweringmaleness that can sometimes turn into toxic masculinity. Thank you, next.🚨🚨🚨SPOILERS AHEAD, PROCEED WITH CAUTION🚨🚨🚨Elain killed the King of Hybern and I am angry.She\'s incapable of doing anything useful and everyone, including the other characters, consistently forgets she exists. How am I supposed to believe she sneaked up behind the big baddie and stabbed him? How is she the hero here? Okay, maybe this is her big moment, when she overcomes her fear and does something awesome, but... where\'s the buildup?I have a theory that NoBrain Elain is actually whip-smart and pretends to be meek and helpless just to manipulate everyone around her. And I have evidence.1. One of Elain\'s only lines of dialogue is, ""I hope they all burn in hell."" And everyone is shocked because she likes gardens and flowers and she hardly ever talks so they all think she\'s weak. But what if this is just Elain\'s true side showing through?2. She holds all of the characters in the palm of her hand. Nesta is obsessed with protecting her. Azriel is in love with her. Feyre will do anything to save her when she gets captured, and so Rhys likes her too just because Feyre does. They risked all of their lives just to sneak into Hybern\'s camp and save her, despite the fact that she has done nothing useful this entire book. What if she\'s manipulating them all, using them for her own gain?That\'s my wild theory. Have fun with it.At the end of the book, Amren sacrifices herself to destroy Hybern. This had the potential to be a really powerful, touching moment. But no. She got brought back from the dead because no one EVER dies in fantasy books. And this makes me mad. Her sacrifice lost all of its pain because there were literally no consequences.🚨🚨🚨SPOILERS HAVE ENDED🚨🚨🚨NoBrain ElainWritten by SofiaNoBrain Elain puts me in painHer stupid shenanigans make me mad againShe\'s a pointless character who does nothingBut add to my unending sufferingShe never talks, but everyone loves herMaybe it\'s trauma, but I still sufferShe gets into trouble and everyone criesI just smile and hope she diesShe belongs with Tamlin, that much is trueIf she ends with Azriel, I will sueNesta may be angering, but at least she\'s not thisI would banish Elain from this earth with my last wishElain, ElainNoBrain ElainNobody cares about your painThis may sound harsh, but rest assuredThe whole book community thinks you\'re absurd3.5 starsACOTAR reviewACOMAF reviewcredit'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'You know you\'re a dedicated fan when you mark an untitled book set to release in 2017 as a ""want to read"".

You will see battles mired with savagery and viciousness, harsh and regrettable decisions and nerve-wracking adventures in a world where humans are perceived as weak and easily destroyable.Sarah J. Maas's world building is so exquisite that I felt detached from my own body, incapable of focusing on anything else happening around me, only flipping the pages with an acute yearning of what's about to happen. She delivers plenty of magic and mayhem, with a knack for perfect pacing of the story and character reflection.CharactersThe Inner Circle, my favourite squad ❤I love their devotion to each other. Their ability to be kind in spite of harsh circumstances, their ability to love despite enduring a millenia of cruelty. They're all so full of light, it makes we want to smile and simultaneously tear up at their unconditional loyalty. I was so attached to them, like I was bound to them by an invisible, irrevocable tether. When they struggled, I struggled. When they were hurt, I was hurt. I could feel their rage, loyalty and honour coursing through my veins, like a shrieking void.High LordsI don't think I would have enjoyed this book at all if not for them. I'm glad thatSarah J. Maasshowed them in a new light, something readers haven't seen in the previous books.As amusing as their banter was, I also feel deeply moved by their actions, their unwavering faith in one another during the battle despite their iffy past.Be itHelion,the Spell Cleaver;Thesan,the healer;Tarquin,the sympathetic and thoughtful leader;Kallias,the snow/ice manipulator andBeron,..... Never mind, I didn't really like him; I loved them with every echoing heartbeat. (Beron being the exception)\u200eOh andTamlin. I apologise if I've been harsh to him after readingA Court of Mist and Fury, but I have a new found respect for him. Despite his impropriety initially, the fact that he finally rises to be a better man by not dwelling on petty vengeance and retribution hit me in the gut and made my eyes burn with warm tears.WhereA Court of Mist and Furywas romance heavy (not that I'm complaining),A Court of Wings and Ruinwas action-packed and was cluttered with twists and magical intrigue and SJM definitely didn't let the romance aspect of the book obliterate the subplot, deftly exploring all the details.I feel weighed down by the intensity of this composition and I vow never to let it slip even from the deepest clutches of my mind ❤""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '4.75!""Night Triumphant- and the Stars Eternal.”I might be in the minority here but I liked ACOWAR more than ACOMAF but this has only happened during this reread before this reread the four times that I read this series I always preferred ACOMAF maybe because I loved the romance but reading this now really made me appreciate the plot and the politics in this book. This book was exactly 700 pages long and 700 pages have never felt this short because I actually flew through them and despite rereading this series every year there were still moments where I forgot certain things happen and the plot twists surprised me as well, the way it was written made it very easy to read a 700 paged book.“I see all of you, Rhys. And there is not one part that I do not love with everything I am.”FeyreI feel like Feyre is very underrated, her cunningness is overshadowed a lot by the fandom because of how compassionate she is because in this because people really rave about how cunning she was and how she made a fool out of the spring court and hey, believe me I loved that scene to probably me best part in this book but then I looked back and saw that Feyre has always been this clever and she made it till this book because of how smart she was and I just feel like its very underappreciated. I love her.“You do not fear... You do not falter. You do not yield.”RhysandI really like Rhys\'s character bur he is probably my least favorite bat boy lol. I liked him, he made rash decisions some I understood, some I did not but in the end it all worked out well. I love how cocky he was and how he presented himself with this calm composure and IDGAF attitude and I also like how he was actually nice and not a total bitch, how he helped everyone and would do anything for the people he loved. The romance between Feyre and Rhys was good as well and I liked how well it was managed in the span of three books.“We\'re all a broken, in our own ways - In places no one might see.”The Inner CircleAmren as always was the character I loved and my heart was beating so fast during those final pages because if ykyk, Cassian, him and Nesta in this book ATE and I loved him. Mor, I was justice for her, I need answers, I love her but I also want to know more about her because we only know bits and pieces about her past and nothing more and finally Azriel, I love that man so much, everything that he said and did was beautiful.“Only you can decide what breaks you, Cursebreaker. Only you.”I think the plot, the entire build up and how it all paid off was really well done and the action sequences were also detailed and really well written, The court intrigue was also something I appreciated. Especially that highlords meeting (prolly my favorite scene) and the bargains that were made, the satisfying endings that we got, the reunions and all of the massive forces aligning together with twists that you won\'t see coming and it was just really good as for the world building I am stunned how it still grew and morphed into something more beautiful.Overall, a really solid conclusion to this series and while tog remains superior, this series will have a special place in my heart!!____Listening to the graphic audio just so I can hear the loml Az say""Be careful of how you speak of my high lady""🤭Reread #4'}]"

She gets up each day, gets a kiss from her husband Nate, and heads off to teach math at the local high school. All is as it should be. Except…Last year, Caseham High was rocked by a scandal involving a student-teacher affair, with one student, Addie, at its center. But Eve knows there is far more to these ugly rumors than meets the eye.Addie can't be trusted. She lies. She hurts people. She destroys lives. At least, that's what everyone says.But nobody knows the real Addie. Nobody knows the secrets that could destroy her. And Addie will do anything to keep it quiet.From theNew York Timesbestselling author Freida McFadden comes a story of twisting secrets and long-awaited revenge.","[{'rating': 1, 'content': 'I\'ve enjoyed previous books by McFadden (Never Lie, The Inmate, The Locked Door) -- so, despite REALLY disliking several of her recent books (The Housemaid\'s Secret, The Coworker, Ward D) -- I still really wanted to read THE TEACHER.This one felt more like her earlier books in a way I enjoyed -- mainly that it was super fast-paced and full of characters to dislike, so despite some serious misgivings along the way, I still had it clicking along at a pleasantly-surprising two or three stars in my head, but then the epilogue happened. I always expect a McTwist or twelve, and of course won\'t write a spoiler here (( BUT FEEL FREE TO SCROLL DOWN IF YOU WANT THEM )), but that last ""twist"" was completely fucking unacceptable on many levels.* thanks to Poisoned Pen Press for the NetGalley review copy.

Who is digging? Who is dead? Fun start!Then we flash back to three months earlier where we meet Eve Bennett, who is putting on a pair of black JIMMY CHOO stiletto pumps to go to her job teaching high school math (lol) and thinking about how hot her husband Nate is compared to her... and also how much she hates him because they never fuck anymore. Nate also teaches at the high school - English - and is the hottest hottie hot hot teacher at the school, based on a list made by the senior girls that another faculty member knew about and then shared with Eve?The next chapter is from Addie\'s perspective. She\'s a junior, and everyone at school hates her because last year there were rumors she had a relationship with her math teacher, Arthur Tuttle (who is decidedly NOT a hottie hot hot teacher as he evidently resembles Santa?), while he was tutoring her and ""ruined his life"". Eve doesn\'t like Addie because Arthur is the nicest man ever and could *never* do such a terrible thing. Because that\'s 100% how the world works. Men who seem nice could never, ever be predators. Duh.Addie gets bullied a bunch by a girl named Kenzie Montgomery - a popular cheerleader who is also (supposedly, but as it turns out way later is NOT) dating Addie\'s old BFF, Hudson Jankowski. Hudson was Addie\'s only friend for years - they both had drunk dads and not much money - but then Hudson got swole and started playing football and is now super popular.Anyway, Eve is PISSED because Addie the Santa Destroyer is in her math class and she\'s going to have to teach her even though she has a ""terrible feeling about this girl."" She drowns her sorrows by going to a shoe store at the mall and thinking about stealing some LOUBOUTINS because it wouldn\'t be a FMcF book without the word LOUBOUTINS in it at least once, but then she doesn\'t steal the LOUBOUTINS and goes home and tries to bone Hot Nate, but he\'s not into it, so they eat some pasta instead. Everyone in this book eats A LOT of pasta.Addie hates math and is not happy to be in mean Eve\'s class, but she\'s super jazzed because she\'s also in Hot Nate\'s English class and Hot Nate loves poetry and Addie writes poetry and he also writes poetry and he loves Edgar Allan Poe and she also loves Edgar Allan Poe and OMG!!!!!!!!! Addie writes a poem and Hot Nate LOVES it and wants to see her after class because her poem is so amazing and a lyrical masterpiece and should be published. He recruits her for the high school poetry magazine (called REFLECTIONS, dear lord), and he makes a lot of eye contact with his chocolate-bar-brown eyes.Later that day, Eve puts on her MANOLO BLAHNIK boots and ditches Hot Nate to go to a shoe store. It is very important to know that Eve really, REALLY likes shoes. Like so much. She tries on the same LOUBOUTINS she tried on at the mall and then Jay the hot shoe salesman feels her up and they go fuck in the storeroom among the piles of shoes. As it turns out, our girl Eve has been making love (vomit) with the shoe salesman once a week for the past four months and wishes she could run away with him. Oh, Eve.Addie and Hot Nate are at a Reflections meeting and he tells her he\'s entering her poem in a state competition because she is ""a master of this craft, even at sixteen"" and is so amazing. Addie says she\'s not amazing at math and Hot Nate asks if his wife is giving Addie a hard time and then says a bunch of shit about how he was dumb at math too and his wife is too logical and not a dreamer like they are... and now Addie is officially being groomed!Then it\'s Eve\'s thirtieth birthday and she puts on her LOUIS VUITTON pumps and tries to bone Hot Nate before work, but he\'s not into it again. Uh oh. Later that night they go out to dinner at a (yep) pasta restaurant and have a terrible time. Nate parks really far away from the entrance to the restaurant which is a dick move because she\'s still wearing those LOUIS VUITTON pumps with a four-inch heel. Eve thinks she should try to connect more with Hot Nate and let him read his poems to her in a park again like he used to (all I can think about are the Kens playing guitar at the Barbies for four hours on the beach), even though she doesn\'t even like poetry and would rather do quadratic equations because she likes MATH, goddammit. Hot Nate gets flirted with by the waitress and then spots Addie at the restaurant and talks about Addie\'s lyrical mind and their mutual love of Edgar Allan Poe a bunch to his wife. Happy B-day, Eve! Addie notices Hot Nate is eating ravioli and ponders his filling selection and wishes she was eating dinner with him so he could share his thoughts about EAP poems with her (again with the Kens on the beach).Addie and Hot Nate run into each other by the pasta restaurant bathroom (sex-ay!) and she worries that someone will see them talking and he\'ll end up ruined like Santa Tuttle. She tells him about her terrible day being bullied, so he gives her a special homework assignment to write an angry revenge letter to her bully and Addie thinks about what a bitch Eve is for making Hot Nate so unhappy. After the terrible birthday meal, Eve finds a pair of glossy red SAM EDELMAN sling pumps on her porch from Jay. Awww. Sex shoes!Addie\'s locker gets filled with shaving cream by mean Kenzie, and during the cleanup -- in the first McTwist -- reveals that Hudson helped her kill her father. DUN DUN DUNNNNN! Her dad was a drunk, abusive asshole and they pushed him down the stairs and pretended they were at Hudson\'s house studying the whole time. After the murder Hudson completely stopped talking to her, but he still helps her clean her locker because he is such a nice guy.Then Hot Nate comes along and helps clean up the last bit of locker shaving cream and offers Addie a ride home from school in his Honda Accord. Addie is digging the ride because the car is cleaner than her mom\'s and smells like him, and he tells her about the difficulty he experienced being a poetry-writing sixteen-year-old boy and recites the first poem he ever wrote (for his mom, at age six, which Jesus H DOES NOT COUNT AS A POEM), and she wishes they would kiss and thinks ""there\'s something poetic about the name Nathaniel"" (aaaand I am officially dead because my husband is named Nathaniel and I can\'t stop laughing even though this entire situation is gross AF).ANYWAY, Eve fucks Jay again. Addie cheats on a math midterm and gets busted. Eve wears her MANOLO BLAHNIKS to school. Hot Nate takes Eve to the bone zone after school so she doesn\'t rat Addie out to the principal for cheating on the math test. Addie steals Kenzie\'s keys, lets herself into her house, and breaks a ceramic bird.We are now 47% through this goddamn book.Hot Nate and Addie talk again after a Reflections meeting, and he lets her know that he got her out of trouble with his mean wife. Addie hugs Hot Nate to say thank you, ""But then something firm pokes me in the leg. Like a roll of toilet paper."" Um. I have read more than my fair share of sex business in books and have never in my life heard a boner compared to a roll of toilet paper. I have a lot of questions.Hot Nate apologizes to Addie for the toilet roll in his pants and then immediately launches into complaining about how his wife sucks and how he feels like he\'s finally connected to someone for the first time in his life. Addie leaves but can\'t stop thinking about that firm toilet paper pants roll (GIRL, RUN!) and comes back. Hot Nate says he\'s trying so hard to resist her but he just can\'t and then they go into the abandoned photography darkroom and make out a bunch. Hot Nate drives Addie home afterwards and tells her she\'s his soulmate. Then he goes home and tries to bone zone Eve but she turns him down, so now his toilet roll is blue and he is mad.Addie writes a terrible poem about her love for Hot Nate. Then Hot Nate reads her a terrible poem that he wrote. And now I can no longer call him Hot Nate as a joke because he\'s officially a fucking rapist.Addie and Sexual Predator Nate have a lot of predatory sex in the darkroom. SP Nate continues with the soulmate talk to keep Addie hooked even though ""it doesn\'t last long, and Nathaniel says that\'s normal when you like somebody as much as he likes me."" AAAAAAAGH. Addie starts thinking about how much better everything would be if Eve was not around anymore.Then Addie gets her lunch dumped on the ground by Kenzie and Kenzie sees a copy of the poem SP Nate wrote. Eve is mean and won\'t let Addie eat a sandwich during class, so Addie hates her even more. Eve and SP Nate have a bad dinner party with their friends. Eve spots Addie lurking in the bushes outside of their house and tells SP Nate about it. Eve then tells the principal and Addie gets hauled into the office. SP Nate tells her to ""deny everything"" so she lies and says she wasn\'t there, but since she also got busted lurking outside of Santa Tuttle\'s house no one believes her. SP Nate starts ghosting Addie so she goes to see him in his classroom during lunch. They kiss AND EVE SEES THEM and takes a picture.This is the part of the book where Eve talks a bunch about how none of this is Addie\'s fault and that she is a child and that SP Nate is a fucking creep who took advantage of her vulnerability and that it was his responsibility to keep this from happening because he is an adult. Then goes on to say the age of consent is sixteen, so he\'s technically NOT a rapist. Keep all of this in mind when we get to the fucking epilogue.Eve then meets up with her fuckboy shoe salesman Jay and tells him everything. They decide she needs to leave Nate and also decide not to tell the principal. Then Eve gets wasted, confronts Nate, and kicks him out. He yells at her a bunch about shoes and leaves. He texts Addie and says he wishes Eve was dead. Addie concurs and eats a bunch of ice cream. Eve also eats a bunch of ice cream and passes out on the couch. She wakes up to a loud crash and worries someone is breaking in to steal her LOUBOUTINS because that is rational and because LOUBOUTINS haven\'t been mentioned for a few chapters.omfg we\'re almost at the end. buckle up.The crashing sound was Addie knocking a frying pan off of the stove. Eve and Addie confront each other and Eve says a bunch of reasonable things about SP Nate being a manipulative predator and how his feelings for a teenager are not normal and Addie flips the fuck out and hits Eve in the head with the frying pan. Three times. She calls SP Nate using Eve\'s phone and SP Nate comes over. Eve wakes up while Addie is getting a sheet to wrap her corpse in and SP Nate strangles her. Addie notices that Eve\'s body is in a different location and now she has big finger-shaped bruises on her neck, but SP Nate convinces her to help put Eve\'s body in the trunk and they drive her body to an abandoned pumpkin patch. We learn that SP Nate\'s biggest fears are death and snakes. They start digging a hole, but then SP Nate lies about getting Eve\'s purse from the car and abandons Addie and goes home to bed. Addie finishes burying Eve and messages Hudson to come pick her up from the middle of nowhere.Now SP Nate is at home and weird shit keeps happening. He finds shoes in the shower and thinks about The Raven a bunch and eventually calls the police to report Eve missing. He then finds more shoes in strange places - some covered in dirt, some with smashed pumpkin on them, and then there\'s a bird in his kitchen so he thinks about The Raven some more. FFS.The police visit Addie and question her a little and seem to think she killed Eve because SP Nate shows them her rage letter about Kenzie. Then Kenzie shows up at Addie\'s house and apologizes for being such a huge bitch and tells Addie SHE was in a relationship with SP Nate when she was FOURTEEN and knows Addie is also being abused because SP Nate gave them both the same shitty poem (which she saw in the lunchroom) and they had to break up when Addie had her Santa Tuttle scandal so that\'s why she hates Addie so much. The girls then go to the police station and tell them everything - and the police actually believe them, which feels like a fucking miracle.SP Nate is home and finds a pumpkin with a bird inside in his kitchen and freaks out because THE RAVEN. The police are on their way so he goes to the pumpkin patch to check Eve’s grave and make sure she\'s really dead. Uh-oh... The grave is empty! Eve is alive! Turns out she unburied herself and called Jay to come get her. Jay takes her to the sexy shoe store and gives her some sensible winter non-fuck boots and hides her in his tool shed for a few days. They start pranking SP Nate with the shoes and pumpkins and birds and whatnot and when he goes to the grave they are waiting and hit him with a rock and chuck him in the hole and bury him alive. While digging, Eve remembers the poem SP Nate wrote her when she was fifteen and he was her teacher - and (McTwist!) it’s the same poem he gave Addie and Kenzie so I guess we’re all happy SP Nate is going to be dead in the pumpkin patch because he\'s a Serial SP with an unstoppable toilet roll.Now we’re (FINALLY) in the epilogue.The police stop investigating because Eve isn’t actually dead and they assume SP Nate just left town without a trace. Eve quits her job and also moves away. Hudson and Addie are friends again and Kenzie has stopped bullying Addie and no one is being sexually abused anymore, so I guess everyone is fine?And now for the final McTwist:IT TURNS OUT HUDSON JANKOWSKI IS THE JAY EVE WAS FUCKING IN THE SHOE STORE so she’s also a sexual predator despite her earlier CORRECT yelling at SP Nate about it being wrong to - you know - have sex with minors. For fuck’s sake. Also - from a strictly logistical standpoint… how did Hudson/Jay manage to drive to the middle of nowhere and back twice in one night to pick up both Addie and Eve? And why is he hanging out with Addie even though she tried to kill Eve? And he already knows she killed her dad? And how did he and Eve catch all of the birds? And get one to stay in a pumpkin?The end.EDITED 2/22/24 TO ADD/CLARIFY : Jay was not married. The baby was his little brother. The ""her""/woman on the phone was Jay/Hudson\'s mom. And according to FMcF herself... (thanks to a commenter asking FMcF directly) -- EVE KNEW JAY/HUDSON WAS A STUDENT AT HER SCHOOL. Aaaaaaaaaagh barf blech ewwww fuuuuuuck.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Oh my goodness! The moment I lay eyes on any Freida McFadden book, I find myself canceling everything in my life. Even in the midst of preparing Christmas dinner, with invited friends and a few accidental crisps due to my divided attention—I just can\'t resist diving into more chapters.Her latest book should be promoted as the literary equivalent of Pringles: once you pop open the book, there\'s no stopping!""Teacher"" may have its faults, like plot holes, far-fetched twists, and characters you\'d rather punch, curse, and scream at than care about, especially when bad things happen to them. Yet, it\'s undeniably addictive, with an extra-fast pace that keeps you entertained. I caught myself nervously laughing at the end of chapters, and thankfully, the final twist was a masterpiece. No one could see that coming, not even those with strong spidey senses and detective skills like me, who typically ruin surprises by revealing the killer in the middle of movies. I must applaud Freida McFadden; that amazing conclusion had me singing Taylor Swift\'s ""Look What You Made Me Do""!Now, let\'s delve into the main story, centered around three highly antipathetic characters: Eve, a math teacher happily married to the very handsome and older Nathaniel, an English teacher at Caseman High School. People give Eve side-eyes, assuming she\'s too lucky to have lured a man like Nate with her mediocre looks. However, behind closed doors, nothing is as it seems. Her husband touches her monthly as a mandatory activity, and they grow estranged each day, fueling her obsession to buy more expensive shoes and hoard them in secret places around the house.It appears everyone is enchanted by her husband\'s charm. But when a problematic student named Addie is assigned to both her and her husband\'s class, Eve realizes she needs to be cautious. Addie is the reason one of her favorite teachers resigned due to inappropriate behaviors. Did the teacher truly touch that girl, or was she the stalker ruining the man\'s life? What if Addie sets her eyes on her husband? What if things spiral out of control?I\'ll stop here to avoid spoiling your reading experience. Despite its shortcomings, I had an amazing, highly entertaining time with this thriller. Especially in the second half, things get so batshit crazy that you keep telling yourself, ""no way,"" but yes way—it\'s a ride of expecting the unexpected! I\'m rounding up from 3.5 stars to a solid 4; it\'s unputdownable, twisty, and well-executed.I eagerly look forward to reading the next addictive book by the author, including the third book of Millie the Housemaid.Many thanks to NetGalley and Poisoned Pen Press/Sourcebooks for sharing this wonderful book\'s digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest thoughts.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology:medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Just wait a moment.

However, when a new affair blossoms, those involved are willing to go to any length to keep it a secret. No matter what.MY THOUGHTSThe Plot:Okay prepare for arant review, because boy oh boy do I have a lot to say. First off, this book was like the off-brand version of My Dark Vanessa. I don't know why, but so many things, and I mean SO. MANY. THINGS. Were almost exactly like that book. It was like Freida took that plot and turned it into a thriller. QUITE LITERALLY. This book wanted to be My Dark Vanessa so fucking bad and it's NOT. That was my thought the entire time reading the book is it felt like a rip-off. Second, this book can barely be called a thriller. This is probably the LEAST thrilling thriller I have ever read. The entire 70% of the book was build-up. 70%!!! The first 70% could have been literary fiction (*cough cough My Dark Vanessa cough cough*). I'm sorry (not really) I cannot stress that point enough. The actual thriller part was SO incredibly lackluster. It was boring. It was so boring. The best thing I can say about this is that it's a fast read. The plot twist was fucking stupid. It was predictable. There was no point where I was on the edge of my seat. I never was left guessing or creating theories in my mind. There was little to no creativity here!!! Ugh it was FRUSTRATING!!!! I am so glad this was on kindle unlimited because I would NOT have purchased this as a physical copy.The Characters:Long story short, everyone in this book is stupid and immature. Eve is beyond obsessed with shoes to the point that that's all she cares about...especially during the plot twist (IYKYK) and she was so incredibly plain. Nate was a p*dophile and he was gross, need I say any more? Addie was the most childish 16 year old I've ever read about in a book. I understand that people can be naive, but girly pop...come on. Nobody can be this stupid like she was in this book. I can't even bother to write anymore about these characters.Overall, do not waste your time on this book. I wish I could take back the 8 hours I spent reading this because I could've used it reading something else. Normally I love Freida's books, but I cannot get past the points I made above. I think this is my least favorite of all of the books I've read by her.

I am genuinely doubting if it's even written by Freida McFadden and not a sixteen year old. Maybe I'm the only one but her writing was so different than her other books. Freida, it's okay, no one was putting a gun to your head, you did not have to write this novel if you didn't want to. Every single word felt so forced.Major Problem #2The characterswere even more infuriating. I can't think of even one character that I liked even a little bit. I have no interest reading 400 pages about some psychopathic pedophiles. This honestly disgusted me so much, the way such thing was romanticised throughout the book.And there we go with stupid naive MCs ...Addie love, you're so lucky you're fictional, otherwise I would've loved to slap you to your senses. They say love makes you blind, but it made our sweet MC dumb, deaf and extremely stupid too.The other award goes to our second mc - Eve. She was so insecure throughout the whole book and always moaning and complaining - I'm not pretty enough, not curvy enough - maybe when you'll stop your husband will finally love you.Problem #3Romance- non existent.Problem #4I can still come in terms with bad writing and characters but atleast give me a goodplot twist.Half of them I saw coming from miles away and there were no jaw dropping revelations that I was anticipating. I am honestly so disappointed.Problem #5The ending-It literally makes no sense??? Eve was sleeping with Hudson the whole time? Are you for real? And if I remember correctly, it was mentioned that Hudson was talking with his wife on the phone call. And had a baby? Who he was babysitting that makes sense but a wife?

She be blown. The first response (from Reddit – oh how I love the subReddits) states “I get why it's popular because it's fast paced and a very easy read but the plot is so derivative and the writing style is so annoying.” To that I say – PREACH.Talk about an easy reader. The plot (LOL plot!) here starts with a body being buried in the woods. You then meet the “teacher” (teacherS in this case since Eve is married to a fellow educator named Nate) and their student Addie. It doesn’t take much of an I.Q. to figure out EVERYTHING that is going to happen so I have no idea what “twists” people cream their jeans over. Maybe they are contained in her other books???? (Sidenote to anyone thinking of making a drinking game every time “shoes” are mentioned. Don't do it. You will die from alcohol poisoning.)Apparently she has a real rabid fanbase so I guess I can look forward to potentially getting trolled for eternity like I have for nearly a decade by the Cohorts (note to trolls - I delete and block you rather than engage so have a blessed day and maybe go outside and touch some grass). It also appears from my quick one minute search of the interwebs that she apparently is a copycat so the half that don’t love her want her cancelled. Bottom line? No matter what we readers/reviewers can’t win. But before any of you go all keyboard commando please note that popcorn thrillers like these are a dime a dozen and trying to claim Freida steals from Riley Sager, an author who admittedly makes his millions reimagining others’ tales, isn’t gonna hold up in court.

AndFirst Lie Winssure does.When I go into a mystery/thriller, my expectations are always sky high. I know, I know... I'm setting myself up for failure. But I can't help it. There's so much hype surrounding books in this genre, it's hard not to get swept up in the excitement.By the time I get my hands on the book, I'm usually frothing at the mouth, hoping this is the thriller that will make my eyebrows raise so high and my jaw drop so hard that I end up looking like a cartoon character. But alas, I remain looking firmly like myself. So it's quite a delight when I come across one that actually delivers on the thrills.Right off the bat, this feels like a unique story. It isn't just your typical domestic thriller, with the is he/she trying to kill the other, and yes he/she is, but the twist is that no he/she isn't, but gotcha the last twist is that he/she really is. (You can tell from my bitterness that I've read too many of those.) Thankfully, this story has nothing to do with that. Instead, it reminds me ofAlias, one of my favorite TV shows of all time.I absolutely love the way this story is plotted. It's got so many threads all interweaving together, along with plenty of twists and turns. In fact, this story surprised me so many times I lost count. And the reveals aren't just saved for the end where they are dumped on you in one go, but instead nicely spaced throughout so you get plenty of surprises along the way.If I had to point to one weakness, it would be the writing. There was something about it that came across a bit forced to me, as if it hadn't gone through all the necessary rounds of editing. It didn't flow naturally, and it took me out of the story at times. Along with how complex the plot is and how much explanation is required, and the whole thing felt more convoluted and clunky than it needed to be. Still, that seems like a small complaint when the plot is so enjoyable.As is usual for this genre, you should go in blind. Don't peek at the blurb/book jacket and definitely don't read any summaries. Unfortunately, I didn't follow my own instructions. I have this urge to read anything placed in front of me (instructions, ingredient lists, street signs, what have you), and in a moment of baby-related sleep deprivation, I accidentally read the book jacket. It wasn't a huge spoiler, but it did clue me in on the direction of the story and the initial chapters. So you've been warned.If you're looking for a thriller that's a bit different and will actually thrill you, this is definitely a worthwhile contender. I suspect it'll end up being one of the biggest thrillers of the year.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

All I know is that what started off as a strong book with a few great twists in the beginning, it soon went downhill with some over the top moments that were so unbelievable and unbearable to read. If this was a television show, I would have changed the channel with a quickness.And what I found absolutely implausible about this story was the fact that no matter what job assignment “Evie” was assigned to, her friend Devon was able to assist her. No problems ever came about there. That was so outlandish, I had to roll my eyes at every section that he occurred. Just wondering if anyone else found that odd? 🤔Please read other’s reviews before deciding whether or not to read this book, as I seem to be quite alone in my opinion.

I\'m thrilled to announce one of the best action-packed, twisty, scheming, mind-throbbing thrillers with a perfect cat-and-mouse game that keeps you glued to your seats, eyes on the pages, afraid of breathing, and just reading till you reach the final page – much like an addict satisfying mystery cravings! Reese’s Book Club made a marvelous choice!My feelings still hurt from the rejection after requesting an arc copy from publishers. I made disgusted noises after receiving that foreboding NetGalley mail, feeling like I was being stabbed by tiny glass pieces from all directions. (Yes, I never quietly accept rejection like a normal person). Anyway, at least they gave me the chance to go book shopping and add a great hardcover to my library, which might cover my entire study. (I barely take a step without hitting my face on the book mountains, but who cares? I\'m happy to drown in books.)Let\'s focus on why I adored this reading and why it\'s not just one of the best releases of the month but also one of the best thrillers of the year. Evie Porter, even though that’s not her real name, is tough, extremely smart, playful, guarded, observant, bold, rightful, a survivor, the main character of the book, who won my heart with brownie points. I easily resonate with her, and as the author takes us on the journey from her past and the dangerous jobs she’s attended throughout the years, my respect for her and my understanding of the reasoning behind the choices she’s made grow with each chapter. She’s a kickass, smart, powerful woman that awakens your inner heroine to roar, fight, conquer.The fast-paced progression of the story and whirlwind action scenes, the mind games between Mr. Smith and Evie increase your appetite to find out more, formulating new explanations about the big scheme. But our author is too smart, always a few steps ahead of us, preventing us from expecting the revelations and big twists. She keeps giving us sucker punches, pulling the rug from under us, killing our spidey senses with more ""you-never-see-that-coming"" revelations that make you gasp, your mouth agape, minds blown.Great trajectory, well-established character development, heart-throbbing pace, jaw-dropping conclusion is the formula that made me fall for this book and do everything to keep it on your radar!Here’s a quick recap of the plot: Evie Porter seems like a nice Alabama girl, finally embracing her happy ending with a gorgeous guy who saved her in a damsel-in-distress position. He asks her to live with him in a house she’s been dreaming of since her childhood: a white picket fence, a beautiful vegetable garden in progress, a peaceful neighborhood. What more could she expect? But when her boyfriend Ryan’s problematic friend with alcoholism and money issues appears with a new girlfriend named Lucca Marino, Evie\'s specially planned, new world shatters because her real name is not Evie. It’s Lucca Marino. And she’s sent to this little suburban paradise not to flirt with Ryan but to watch his moves and the illegal interactions he’s handling at his side job every Thursday where he disappears.Who is this woman reciting the same life story she has, disguising like Lucca? Could her longtime boss Mr. Smith send her to rattle Evie, or is there a more dangerous game somebody is playing to ruin her life? The only way to find out is to face the challenge and let the games begin!I’m cutting off here not to give much away! Get ready to roll and prepare your grey cells to get burned, losing yourself in a high-tempo, entertaining, exciting mind game, a wild ride you never want to leave, and take a few more hours to enjoy Evie/Lucca, whoever she’s in this full-throttle world!If you’re interested in reading my extended book reviews, movie critiques, and hilarious astrology articles, be sure to check out my Medium account using the link below:medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""I fell hard for the hype, but it was not meant to be.I read a sample ofFirst Lie Winsonce before and put it down, but I picked it up again after reading a few rave reviews.

I never really got into it.What it came down to was two things:boredom and disbelief. There was never a point in my reading of this book when I wasn't experiencing one or the other.We move between the present, where Evie Porter pursues her mark, Ryan Sumner, on the orders of her mysterious boss, Mr. Smith, and flashbacks to her past and previous jobs leading up to where she is now.The flashbacks I found boring, but I'm in the minority here; many of my GR friends seemed to find this book very compelling.

It felt like I was being bombarded with twists, turns, different characters (or just different character names) and whatever it may have achieved in fast-pacing sacrificed my ability to care for any of the characters.It read to me like a very cheesy undercover agent thriller. I also very quickly guessed whoMr. Smith wasbecause there weren't enough realistic options for who it could be.""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Hmm did I read the same book as everyone else? 🤔'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I found listening to this book as an audiobook to be engaging and suspenseful.

Plus, neon-coloured font? Say entirely less. Happy to report that I was not disappointed. The hype is real. HOWEVER,extreme yeetage of disbelief is required for maximum enjoyment.If you go into this trying to line it up with reality, you\'ll be sorely disappointed. This is Blacklist lite; you gotta lean into the ridiculousness. If you can do that, good times are had.This is extremely bingeable. It\'s very action-driven. You\'re spared the waxing poetic inner monologue thankfully. You get a little peek at ""Evie\'s"" backstory, but most of her inner monologue is focused on the who, what, where, and why of right now. I liked the dual timeline structure that slowly revealed pertinent clues to solve the ""current"" mystery. There are baby bombshells throughout (love this), and although things become a little convoluted near the end, you\'ll definitely keep flipping the pages as the intrigue ratchets up.I would\'ve liked a little more depth in Evie and Ryan\'s characters. I understood why Evie started scamming hoes, but it takes a lot of gall to actually execute and I\'m curious as to how she learned how to run a good scam. And then Ryan... no spoilies but like, we needed more info on what motivates him, his true character, and what Evie liked about him. I have A LOT of questions regarding these two, but it didn\'t really take away from my enjoyment of the book. FYI, there is romance in here and fade to black ""spice"" but ya\'ll will survive, I promise you.Apparently this book has been in development with Hulu since fall 2022 (get the bag, girl) and I am PUMPED. I can\'t wait to see how this plays out. I know screen adaptations are never as good as the book, but in this case I think it\'ll be even better as a movie since it\'s so action-driven.

It’s available on January 2, 2024.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""In a Nutshell:An interesting cat-and-mouse drama. Steady-paced, twisty enough, gripping throughout. Recommended, but not necessarily as a fast-paced thriller.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Story Synopsis:Evie Porter has just moved in with her dreamy boyfriend Ryan Sumner, a rich businessman with a grand family home. Is she excited? Yes, but not as you would imagine. You see, ‘Evie Porter’ doesn’t exist. The identity of Evie has been given to her by her mysterious boss “Mr. Smith”, and moving in with Ryan and learning everything about his business is one of her tasks on this ‘job’. She cannot allow her comfort with Ryan to supersede her professionalism. But when an unexpected surprise reveals itself, Evie begins to wonder if she is on the job, or if she herself IS the job.The story comes to us in Evie’s first person perspective.PSA: Go in blind!Bookish Yays:😍 The plot: Innovative without being over the top. I like this kind of unreliable narrator story because the narrator isn’t making a fool of us by feeding us false information but by revealing only as much as she wants to. It’s nice to figure out if the con artist is conning someone else or being conned or worst of all, conning us!😍 The cat-and-mouse factor: The book is very clearly a cat-and-mouse dramatic thriller, but you will keep changing your mind about who is the cat and who is the mouse.😍 The twists: These come at regular intervals. Some of them, I could guess, and some caught me unawares. But almost all were interesting.😍 The main characters: Usually in thrillers of any kind, we get a clear picture of which character to trust and which character to doubt. Not in this book though. I kept changing my mind back and forth about Evie and Ryan.😍 The romantic relationship: As Evie has just stepped into a new phase of the relationship with Ryan, I was worried that their romance would supersede the core story. But the author uses their relationship as an impetus to the main plot rather than making the relationship itself the focus. Their connection is used well.😍 The character development: The writing is really intelligent, especially at the start. You get a cue of how Evie’s mind functions without any devious sentence from her. It is understated, yet impactful in keeping us on our toes. Well done!😍 The ending: Really good and fairly satisfying, which made me forgive and forget the minor loopholes in the rest of the content.😍 The use of the title in the plot: So clever that it is almost like a master class in lying! (Yeah, that’s not really a good thing to learn, but hey, it is a useful skill! 😉)Bookish Mixed Bags:😐 The writing structure: Divided between ‘Present Day’ and some flashbacks containing details of the earlier jobs handled by “Evie” for Mr. Smith. I initially felt that these backstories were superfluous and just a way of extending the book, but by the time I reached the finale, I realised how important each story was in the overall plot. That said, a couple of the past gigs were drawn out and boring. Also, the ‘Present Day’ plot was so interesting that it was a bit frustrating to diverge into the past in the midst of the present action.😐 The pacing: Just as I like thrillers to be. Not so fast as to eat up the details, and not so slow as to kill me of boredom. It is fairly quick and steady throughout. However, if you like your thrillers fast and furious, you might be disappointed.😐 The complexity: This story being too complicated is both a pro and a con! I still don’t know if I understood the whole of it, but what I understood, I mostly enjoyed. But if you ask me to explain some of the finer points, I’ll be totally lost! 😁😐 The typical sidekick character – a tech genius who can crack anything and everything without ever coming on the radar of either the police or the villain – is so done to death! I liked the character, but I am bored of characters like him.Bookish Nays:😒 There are a few teeny plot holes and coincidences and exaggerations. Some of the character motivations are weird! Then again, these are the features of almost every thriller, which is why I am not a happy reader of this genre.All in all, I definitely enjoyed this psychological drama as it kept me hooked throughout. I am not a thriller lover by any means, especially as so many “thrillers” these days seem like carbon copies of each other. This book was mostly a breath of fresh air. The pacing might not satisfy all avid thriller readers, so it’s better if you read this as a twisty medium-paced cat-and-mouse drama.This author is supposedly known for her YA thrillers and romances, and this is her first foray into Adult Thrillers. But as I haven’t read any of her YA works, all I can say is that this book doesn’t feel YA any time, which is great!I will end with the same advice I give myself before picking up such a story: Read it without overanalysing to enjoy it better. Because of the unique and complex structure and multiple timelines in the past, I wouldn't recommend this book on audio.4 stars.I read a complimentary copy of this book through The Pigeonhole.

For me this was a mixed bag so I’ll go with my PROS AND CONS format..PROS:Very interesting premise, really different from most thrillers I’ve readA main protagonist, Evie Porter” who was walking a fine line between “awful person just out for money and maybe she’s not so bad after all”A interesting cast of characters although not very well developed.A great twist in the middle where an imposter shows up with Evie Porter’s true name, Lucca Marino. This throws everything into the air and Evie has to figure out who this person really is and what she is doing here.“The first lie has to be the strongest. The most important. The one that has to be told”CONS:This book broke one of my cardinal rules “Don’t tell me – Show me”. I really don’t like to have the book explained to me in the last quarter, I’d rather have clues to figure out the puzzle on my own.The constant shifting from present to past grew a little tiresome. At times I wasn’t sure who was who - but I guess that was the desired effect.The ending was full of twists but believability has to be put on hold. The ending just seemed to OTT for me.This is the author’s first shift from YA to adult books and I think this is a good one.

And the main reason is because ""Evie Porter"" is nothing more than a carefully crafted persona, one of many that \'Evie\' has been given as an employee of the mysterious and calculating Mr. Smith. This is nothing more than her latest con job, and Evie is ready to play the part with ease. She meets some of Ryan\'s friends and finds it easy to stick to her story...until the unthinkable happens.She hears a name at a party that is a LITTLE too familiar...herOWNreal name, Lucca.It turns out Evie may not be theONLYoperative in town...but why on earth would Mr. Smith have given HER name and, in turn, HER true backstory to another woman? Through many years, locations, and personalities, Evie has worked to keep Lucca\'s name and personality underground and locked away on the chance that she might have to go back to her someday...but now it looks as if this opportunity is slipping through her fingers.Is this con MORE than just another plot for Mr. Smith\'s devious and dastardly revenge on others...but a plot to exact revenge on EVIE? Can she find a way to outsmart the ultimate con-man...before the REAL Lucca exposes all?I\'ll be honest, the glowing 5 star ratings wereEVERYWHEREbefore I even picked this one up, and I\'ve been DYING for a good, juicy thriller with twists, turns, and deception for a LONG time...probably since I picked up Julie Clark\'s The Lies I Tell back in JANUARY of this year!With a clever and cunning \'cat\' like Evie at the helm, and many positive blurbs from authors I love and reader friends I trust, I was almost certain this one would be a home run for me.But much like attending a baseball game, what sounds like a fun diversion in theory (okay, maybe with baseball it\'s a bit of a stretch for me anyway) left me ACHING for a Seventh Inning Stretch.Elston comes to us from the world of YA, and I have to say overall, I wouldn\'t have guessed...and with a book that is this complicated, that\'s a definite compliment! The characters in this one didn\'t read \'young\' (as is so often the case when authors make this transition) and the plotting felt deep and intricate enough for an adult book.But sadly for me...this is where the positives ended.At first, I was intrigued by Evie and her manipulation of Ryan and thought the plot was going to center around that deception...which in and of itself would have been interesting. The minute we started taking long jaunts into the past and to all of her previous con jobs though...it became clear to me that this book was going to be a lot LESS about the inner-workings of the characters minds and the internal battle of Evie (Am I good? Am I evil? Do I want to leave this life behind) and more just plot point after plot point.To me, the book just felt like a steam engine, relentlessly chugging along but without letting me as the reader process the scenery and FEEL anything.Elston spent SO much time making sure you, the reader, knew how PERFECTLY plotted everything was along the way and that she (and subsequently her MC) had thought of everything.While this is an impressive feat, ""perfect"" plotting just isn\'t enough for me for a thriller to feel visceral and memorable to me. As much as I\'m sure everything does line up and make sense (and towards the end, most of the intricacies of the past cons are FINALLY explained in context),I honestly just felt like I was watching an action film in book form.While I occasionally enjoy these type of stories, this one just didn\'t stir anything in me emotionally and a week later, sadly feels more than a bit forgettable.And in the end, while I expected Evie to con EVERYONE in her path...I never expected her to con me.😔3.5 stars'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""This was one twisty rollercoaster ride!Not often do I come across a good con artist thriller and one with a female lead.

The one that has to be told”I found the premise ofFirst Lie WinsbyAshley Elstonto be truly intriguing. Evie Porter, a con artist who works for the mysterious “Mr. Smith” finds herself trapped in a complex web of manipulation as she works on her current mark, Ryan Sumner. Posing as Ryan’s girlfriend while passing on information about Ryan’s business to her boss should have been easy for her, given she has almost perfected her game over the years in Mr. Smith’s employ. However, her growing feelings for Ryan, her feelings of guilt for her deception and her desire for a different life than she has chosen (or the life that has chosen her?) and the added pressure that she is being closely monitored and failing her current task would result in dire consequences, complicate matters further and the situation begins to spiral out of Evie’s control.The beginning of the book drew me in and had me hooked, but as the plot progressed, my enthusiasm dampened. The author’s writing shows promise and I thought most of the twists were well executed (the entry of “Lucca Marino” was a genius plot point). However, too much of the narrative was devoted to telling rather than showing, which detracted from my overall experience. Evie is an interesting protagonist but the oversharing (in excruciatingly minute detail) about both past events and how events unfold in the present timeline not only messed with the pacing and but also made me forget that I was reading what was supposed to be a suspenseful “thriller.” Though not entirely unpredictable, there were a few aspects of the mystery that were well-crafted. However, I wasn’t a fan of how the author chose to end the story and found a few developments/revelations toward the end utterly unconvincing and contrived.After a very long wait for my library copies, I can’t help but feel more than a tad disappointed with this one. Had I not approached this novel expecting a fast-paced, complex, edge of your set thriller, I would have enjoyed it more.I paired my reading with the audiobook narrated bySaskia Maarleveld, who has done a commendable job of breathing life into this story.Connect with me!✏Instagram✏My Blog✏The StoryGraph'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'You know what the most surprising thing about this amazing roller coaster of a ride complete with upside down and backward twists and turns? That I had NO complaints… none, zip, zero, de nada.

If you want something proofed, I’m your person. I have a lot of 4-star books, but 5-stars… authors have to really work hard to get that fifth star because there’s ALWAYS something I wish was different.

Don’t even read the blurb. When I saw a few of my fave GR reviewer friends (looking at you Darla, Marilyn, Yun, Jamie, and company) give this thrill ride 4s and 5s, that’s all I needed to know and away I went.I loved all of Elston’s characters— the good, the bad, and the ugly. But her pacing and the way she feeds backstory was the secret sauce to this 5 Michelin star recipe. As they say, I’ll read anything by her from now on.

I just couldn’t wait to see what was in store for Evie and friends next, so we ordered door dash and I avoided my cell phone like the plague for two nights.Before I end this ridiculously over-the-top review (which will have typos, because I can never successfully proof my own GR reviews the first time out), I just want to say, despite the glitches (and the lost reviews), I sincerely love this platform and my reading life is so much better because of other reviewers! (I figured with this much love, it wouldn’t hurt to spread some of it around.)PS. Le sigh— I just realized that I better pick my next book carefully. My 5-star reads are rarely followed by another. Any suggestions?(Reviewed 5/27/24)'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'THIS WAS MY FAVORITE BOOK OF 2023!Hold on. I need to catch my breath after thatepic rollercoaster ride of suspense. I’m not kidding.First Lie Winswasso much more than the synopsis promisedand only in the best possible way. Between sometruly wicked twists and turns that had me shouting “WHAT?!?” more than onceand thedeliciously perfect character list, I wasmore than blown away—I was stunned into silence. Trust me when I say thatthis is no normal psychological thriller. It wasa slam dunk success of the highest order.Starting from the top,the plot was pure dynamite.Finely layered and with mind-boggling complexity, it not only had me reading late into the night, but kept my eyes pinned to the page.A deftly woven storyline of dual POVs, there wasn’t a chance of me seeing behind the perfectly drawn curtain. Oh no. Take it from me,the whip-cracking plot that was compelling and intensepiled on top ofsharp writingandnerve-shredding dreadmade this into what issure to be one of next year’s bestselling books.But that wasn’t all that I loved. After all,the characters were both true-to-life, but also beyond the realm of believing. In a sublimegame of cat-and-mouse, I never knew who I could trust, which was one blindingly good feat. Time after time, I threw my belief behind someone only to get knocked over with a feather when I got surprised yet again.Running the gamut from calculating to endearing, I couldn’t help fallinghead over heelswith more than one individual within these much loved pages.The twists, however, were where this novel shined.Unguessable and perfectly set up, each and every onetook me by surprise while also shifting the storyline just so. With them, the story morphed into something altogether different than what I’d been expecting. Trust me when I say,if you think the synopsis sounds good, then the true premise will leave you utterly breathless.All said and done,while I’ve been on quite the streak of winners recently, this one easily takes the cake.Addictive, fast-paced, and complete with some of thebest morally gray charactersI’ve ever read, this is not a book to be missed. In my opinion, this wasStone Cold Foxwith the level dialed up to ten. So if you loved that book or any other with a con artist at its center,be sure to pre-order this puppy today. I, for one, am over the moon as I now enter into the book coma phase of the read.Rating of 5+ stars.SYNOPSIS:For Evie Porter, Ryan Sumner is just the most recent mark in a long list of jobs. A conwoman hired by an elusive man named Mr. Smith, Evie—or rather, Lucca Marino, as she was known prior to meeting her boss—has one goal in sight. To follow the instructions Mr. Smith has set out for her and obtain whatever it is that he needs. No matter what she’s after or how many dangerous risks she must take, she’s in it one hundred percent.This job, however, is sure to be different. For one thing, Ryan has worked his way through Evie’s defenses. Perhaps it’s the constant games that she plays on the unsuspecting, but suddenly the placid life as the wife to a local golden boy seems all too enticing. Besides, her last job didn’t exactly go according to plan, so she’s on rather thin ice with her boss. Tempting as the idea may be, though, Evie continues to try and keep her head in the game.At a party one afternoon, however, the situation goes from bad to worse when Evie’s introduced to the date of one of Ryan’s old friends. Smiling broadly, the attractive young woman says “Hi, I’m Lucca Marino.” Shocked into silence, she realizes the one thing Evie has always worked hard to maintain is now up for grabs. Face to face with her imposter, she knows it’s going to take hard work to beat the odds in this new chess match of wits.Will Evie manage to not only achieve the desired outcome for Mr. Smith, but also have a clean future to return to one day? As far as she’s concerned, she’s more than happy to rise to the challenge. After all, she’s one of the best. If anyone can pull it off, she knows it will be her—just as long as no one else gets in her way.Thank you to Ashley Elston, Pamela Dorman Books, and NetGalley for my complimentary copy. All opinions are my own.PUB DATE: January 2, 2024Trigger warning: con artistry, cancer, burglary, getting roofied, mention of: alcoholism, drug use, fatal car accident'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4.5 starsWell, if you fancy reading a book that has an excellent twist at around 10% in, then this is definitely for you! This is Evie Porter‘s story, but who exactly is she? Why is she in Lake Forbing, Louisiana and specifically with Ryan Sumner? It seems she lives by the mantra “first lie wins“. The stories are told in the present day and back tracks to the last few years of Evie’s life.Wow, this is one interesting novel as all the characters “dance” around each other, sometimes with all the intensity of an Argentine Tango. Evie’s story is a really good one and keeps me glued and turning pages from beginning to end with the questions of the start being intriguingly answered by the finale. It’s full of suspenseful moments and has tension in spades and is a fascinating mystery on several levels which keeps the momentum of the guessing game going.The premise and plot are clever and well thought out and it’s of the thrilling tangled web variety. The pace is brisk, there’s the occasional lull but it’s for a reason which advances the plot and offering up valuable insight into Evie and others. I really like Evie as a central character and grow to admire her creative ability to think on her feet and her tenacity and determination.There are lies and secrets by the truckload, some skeletons in the closet, chameleon characters – it’s got the lot! Needless to say, there are good twists and some are very unexpected and force a rethink.Overall, it’s a cracking, fun, entertaining cat, mouse thriller of a read which I enjoy very much.With thanks to NetGalley and especially to Headline for the much appreciated arc in return for an honest review.'}]"

Every woman he dates goes on to find their soul mate the second they break up. When a woman slides into his DMs with the same problem, they come up with a plan: They'll date each other and break up. Their curses will cancel each other’s out, and they’ll both go on to find the love of their lives. It’s a bonkers idea… and it just might work.Emma hadn't planned that her next assignment as a traveling nurse would be in Minnesota, but she and her best friend agree that dating Justin is too good of an opportunity to pass up, especially when they get to rent an adorable cottage on a private island on Lake Minnetonka.It's supposed to be a quick fling, just for the summer. But when Emma's toxic mother shows up and Justin has to assume guardianship of his three siblings, they're suddenly navigating a lot more than they expected–including catching real feelings for each other. What if this time Fate has actually brought the perfect pair together?","[{'rating': 5, 'content': '5 stars!!“The best kind of love doesn’t happen on moonlit walks and romantic vacations. It happens in between the folds of everyday life. It’s not grand gestures that show how you feel, it’s all the little secret things you do to make her life better that you never tell her about.”You guys do not know how excited I am to write this review because this book meant so much to me and I honestly didnt think a book could mean so much to someone until I read this 🥺 It was so beautifully written, with such emotion, Only one book has managed to make me cry (As long as the lemon trees grow"") while this one did not make me sob, It brought me so close to it when I read the epilogue because it was perfect 🙂\u200d↕️✋🏻 I could have binged this book in one sitting because I was literally free but I was so attached to these characters that I was delaying an inevitable goodbye which hit me so hard because within a span of 400 pages, they gave me so much and took it all away as I closed the book 😔✋🏻 Reading this book was such a serene experience, makes me want to read every Abby book out there because this was fucking beautiful. I have never in my life read a book filled with so much feeling, such perfect representation of guilt, self-hate, anxiety and neglect as this 😮\u200d💨This book perfectly captures gut-wrenching moments mixed with feel-good, heartfelt moments, written with so much emotion that it honestly felt like I was experiencing all this in real life with them with me because there is no way a book can have me on the verge of tears imagining them sitting together as they laugh and live a happy life or make me feel so angry at a character for treating her daughter so bad and I can not stress on how the slow burn made me feel AHHH!! I wanted everything and it eventually gave me everything 😭. The writing was simply breathtaking, it reminded me so much of Emily Henry because usually her books are the type to make me feel this way. The way it described love is gonna make you believe in it 🩷I feel like another way to look at why this book is so perfect for us is because we had unbelievably high expectations like you do not know how high are expectations were, we singlehandedly believed that this would be our summer read and the anticipation that led to this book because were waiting to read it in June but my copy took a month to arrive and then one thing led to another and before we knew it, and we learned that you need to read the first two books (not true, this could be read as a stand alone) 😭😭 but for a better experience we did and we really enjoyed these two but they can not be compared to this masterpiece. It was everything, it managed to exceed everyone of our expectations and we loved every second of it 😌 This showed how good of a book this was.The characters in this book were so fucking precious 🥹. I wanted hug all of them because they all deserved so much better than what they got, We follow two characters Emma and Justin who meet over a twitter thread and having similar relationship problems enter a fling \'Just for the summer\' and one thing leads to another and to know more you would have to read this book because so much happens and I am still stuck in those moments 😔😮\u200d💨✋🏻“You\'re not asking too much,"" he said. ""You were just asking the wrong person. Ask me instead.”Justinwas the epitome of \'If he wanted to he would\' because he did!! 😌 I love how good Abby Jimenez\'s men are. All of them are literally green flags. He was everything that you would look for a man. That man was the standard because no one has ever put themselves out that much for anyone, he was fully committed, the way he comforted and understood Emma\'s trauma and pain and tried to give her time and be there for her was so precious for me because this should be the bare minimum tbh these days, he did all this while struggling himself with his mom going to jail and him having to take care of his family, all of it put together complimented the book well.I mean how can you not love him, he\'s 6ft, charming, charismatic, funny and has dimples + is a software engineer and uses his skills to make fun things for his gf 🤭. I love, love, loved the effort that he put into this relationship and I also love the found family aspect that we got because of him, this whole series tying up to this moment felt like a massive found family and I was in love with it.“In a world where you can choose anger or empathy, always choose empathy,”Emmawas such a strong character tbh because it\'s so hard to find books without any annoying female characters and I was so happy when I found Emma to be so realistic and relatable 😭 I wont agree with anyone saying Emma didn\'t deal with anything in a mature way-✋🏻 Live with a mother who abandons you and neglects you and then judge her✋🏻. Emma was so cute, I loved her and I literally grew so close to her and so fond of her that everything that came rolling down on her made me so sad and angry. I loved the way her character looked at the world, where she would look at things with more empathy and would encourage people to do that as well. People like her are a gem and should be protected at all costs 🩷I hated Emma\'s mother sm 😡 she made me furious because what she did was unforgivable!! to think that Emma could have gotten so much love and such a nice past- but she didn\'t because Amber the fucking bitch was to selfish to do that, she would abandon her and ruin her life, would make her feel like shit and would not care for her or more or less pay attention to her 💔 Especially chapter 41 where she talks to him (yk who) and he tells her about his past and she thinks that\'s it could\'ve been for her.“Maybe home isn’t a place. Maybe it’s a person.”Maddy is the friend we alll want and I am so happy and thankful to god for giving me friends like her because she was perfect. She understood Emma so well, gave her reality checks and supported her, helped Justin figure her out and overall I just loved how she was there for her always. I also loved Emma\'s relationship with Justin\'s brother and I liked how Justin and Emma rekindled because of them<333“What are you thinking?” I asked. He didn’t answer for a long moment. When he did, he did it with his eyes closed. “All I ever think about is you.”The romance was everything that I ever wanted. It was everything. I loved it so much that I literally have no words to describe it, it made me feel every emotion that is out there to exist 🥹 Justin and Emma were made for each other, it was everything that I was looking for in a moment, there banter alone was so well done and their chemistry was perfect tbh. Their domestic scenes had me swooning 😮\u200d💨 where they would cook together and help the kids and I loved how she would just extend her trip. That first kiss scene literally gave me and Emma both butterflies, it was so well done. Although it\'s supposed to be a fling but there\'s so much slow burn and angst and tension filled in this book 🥵 The perfect balance of everything. Like its the perfect fucking combo for everyone out there. I genuinely would read it every year/ every summer.Scenes that I absolutelyloved:1, Justin making Emma pre-date questionnaires and giving her invitations 🤭2, the whole toilet king banter 😭✋🏻3, Dual pov 🙂\u200d↕️4, The confrontation between Emma and her mother 🥺5, Chapter 40 😨6, Justin paddle boating his way through to get on an island just because Emma called him and told him that she was sick 🥹7, The airport hotel scene between Maddy and Emma 🫂8, Sarah emergency contact list scene + JustinEmma domestic scenes 🩷9, Justin and Emma on the date where Leigh and his mom crash with them 🤣10, the first and the last chapter 🩷🫂“The moment Emma came into view, my entire world slipped into slow motion. My brain took a screenshot. I felt the moment freeze and save. She was beautiful.”The plot (Spoilers will be mentioned) started off so cute with the whole fling and it served well for their banter and chemistry and I was excited to see where all of it would go tbh because I wanted to see how all of it would end and oh my god that plot twist that came and hit us?? like me andRoxywere shooketh like we could have figured this out so fast but we were so blind like we were actually so blind and Jimenez did such a mega job keeping us distracted with Justin and Emma that we didnt even figure out the elephant in the roomSPOILERSumm chapter 40?? Daniel and Emma being siblings?? I felt so bad for her when Daniel and her talked and Amber was litr mentioned + Neil was right there HOW did we not notice him LMAOO. anyways I liked how Daniel and Emma got their good moments and she had a better life and found someone to love just because of a summer flingSPOILERS ENDOverall, an amazing read!! I went in with extremely high expectations and read every single word there was to read!! Would definitely recommend!Some of the quotes that I loved;“The love stories sold us the wrong thing. The best kind of love doesn’t happen on moonlit walks and romantic vacations. It happens in between the folds of everyday life. It’s not grand gestures that show how you feel, it’s all the little secret things you do to make her life better that you never tell her about. Taking the end piece of the bread at breakfast so she can have the last middle piece for her sandwich when you pack her lunch. Making sure her car always has gas so she never has to stop at the pump. Telling her you’re not cold and to take your jacket when you are in fact, very, very cold. It’s watching TV on a rainy Sunday while you’re doing laundry and turning her light off when she’s fallen asleep reading. Sharing pizza crusts and laughing about something the kids did and taking care of each other when you’re sick. It isn’t glamorous, it isn’t all butterflies and stars in your eyes. It’s real. This is the kind of love that forever is made of. Because if it’s this good when life is draining and mundane and hard, think of how wonderful it will be when the love songs are playing and the moon is out.”.“Sometimes the best way to show love or be kind to someone is to meet them where they are.”.“Unhealed trauma is a crack. And all the little hard things that trickle into it that would have rolled off someone else, settle. Then when life gets cold, that crack gets bigger, longer, deeper. It makes new breaks. You don’t know how broken she was or what she was trying to do to fill those cracks. Being broken is not an excuse for bad behavior, you still have to make good choices and do the right thing. But it can be the reason. And sometimes understanding the reason can be what helps you heal.”.“Sometimes I feel like the seasons could come and go and come and go, a hundred years could pass, a thousand, the ground could collapse under us, this house could crumble and go back to the earth, and we would still be standing here frozen in time, because every second I’m with you is eternal. I’ve never felt anything like it.”.“Because when you’re in love, you do hard things.”.“I’ve been waiting my whole life to feel like this and I thought it was a curse that nobody else ever worked out. But it wasn’t. It’s just that they weren’t you.”.“To me, love meant you stayed. But now I understood that love sometimes means you let someone go.”.“This is the thing nobody tells you about The One. How they’re timeless. How the moment they pop up again you’re right back in it, right where you left off.”.“Tell me your day today from start to finish.”____This book fucking ruined meEasily my favourite book of the year 😭___In Roxy\'s wise words""This better be revolutionary‼️""•Buddy reading withRoxy__Please, please, please be THE summer romance book.

This was my first book by Abby Jimenez and it put me off to the point that am no longer sure if I want to read any of her other books.✔️ Online meet cute✔️ Insta lovey✔️ Found familyThis was one of the most bland and emotionless writing I have read in a while.There were no feelings to it, I surely did not feel a single thing reading it. The plot execution was so messy and had no direction.The romance was very mid.The two characters start off okay but then their personalities clash. The chemistry is meh. They do have some cute moments but I could not feel a single thing for them.Justin and Emma have issues of their own but Justin deals with things a tad more maturely compared to Emma. Sure, I feel bad for Emma but the way her story and character was written is justso damn boring.Justin's siblings were more cute and I would rather read about them than this tiresome book.I skimmed it towards the end and have no regrets. I realize that it's probably just me who didn't like it but please go in with low expectations.Also, what is the purpose of marketing it as a standalone if we have to read her other books first in order to start liking it?!~•~•~Found family?

This book gives golden retriever 'IF HE WANTED TO HE WOULD' MMC and a complex, good hearted, kind and layered FMC who when brought together, make this story magical. The chemistry is something I could almost reach my hand out and FEEL radiating off the page. The honesty, and communication was so refreshing to see characters who whilst setting boundaries, and being carefree with each other also unashamedly sharing feelings with one another.

I didn’t expect the rollercoaster of emotions I felt reading this one. I cried, I laughed out loud, I annotated. I really liked Part of Your World, I loved Yours Truly, but Just for the Summer is easily my favorite. 100 stars!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Oh boy! Too many words come to mind at once, creating a huge cacophony. They're not enough to express how much I loved this book. Great, brilliant, adorable words aren't doing justice for this most poignant book, and even the best couple and best book boyfriend (OMG: don’t you think Justin is like cinnamon rolls meets mud pie? This character completely changed my perspective about the name, although I still think both Justin Bieber and Justin Timberlake are rubbing me the wrong way) created by Abby Jimenez.I used to think “Part of Your World” was her best work, but “Just for the Summer” exceeded it with Toilet King references, fantastic dating options, so many ugly cries, and sweetest, sighing, swoon-smile-repeat moments blended in heavy triggering subjects that are handled with care and in a realistic way, including PTSD, panic attacks, death, child neglect, dysfunctional family, and mental health issues.The witty and sweet dialogues, catchy banters, physical attraction, and emotional intimacy, along with the perfect chemistry between Emma and Justin, are pure perfection! Even though they met through a Reddit thread that turned into humorous messages and sweet phone calls during the hardest times of their lives, their blooming friendship and curse-breaking designated dates—including four dates, one kiss, and a breakup—are a scenario doomed to fail when the attraction hits the roof.Another best part of the book is seeing cameos from the “Part of Your World” universe. Seeing those favorite characters in this book made me smile a lot.Let’s take a closer look at the plot:The book opens with a laugh-out-loud “Am I the asshole?” Reddit thread written by Justin, a cute, caring 29-year-old engineer who sees his situation as a good luck charm, meaning each woman he dates finds their significant other immediately after their breakup, and they even invite him to their weddings.Emma, a 28-year-old traveling nurse, reads this thread during her lunch break with her bestie Maddie, and she decides to DM the guy because she’s also the good luck charm that every man she dates marries immediately after the breakup. Justin decides to write her back, which turns into very entertaining correspondences. A few days later, they start talking on the phone, and eventually Justin comes up with an interesting offer: if they date each other and break up, they can also break the curse and have a chance to find their soulmates. Emma finds this plan unreasonable at first. She and Maddy had already decided to fly to Hawaii for their rest residence, but as long as she spends more time with Justin on the phone, she decides to change her plans and rent a cozy cottage in Minnesota for only six weeks to help her realize their date plan.She even plays the guilt card to convince Maddy. The plan is simple: they’ll date only for a few weeks, kiss each other goodbye, and ride off into the sunset with their own future soulmates. But when sparks start flying around them and their first meeting turns into being hit by a love truck, the detailed plans, which included more surveys and questionnaires, are fated to fail. Especially when both of them struggle with unexpected mommy-related family issues, which push them toward each other, and Emma, who resists taking people into her heart, finds herself letting not only Justin but his entire family in. Could she learn to set roots somewhere? Could she learn to dissect the barriers to make herself small and open her heart fully to love and be cherished in return?Overall: three words, “I loved it,” and two more words, “read it”! This is one of the best romance novels of the year, and don’t you dare miss it!Oh boy, I couldn’t tell you how much I appreciate this digital reviewer copy I received and how thankful I am to NetGalley and Forever (Grand Central Publishing) for sending me this ARC copy in exchange for my honest review.

I couldn’t connect to the main characters, the romance felt like a side character and had no depth, and the plot felt all over the place at times and wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be. While reading it, I felt literally nothing, as if someone had taken away all my emotions. I don't like to admit it because I don't like doing it in books, but the number of pages I skipped because I was so bored is pretty embarrassing. Our main characters had their first kiss and I was close to falling asleep.Also, is it possible to feel overwhelmed by the amount of things happening in a book to the point that you forget that it is even a romance? Because that's exactly how I felt for most of the story. I recently read a short novella by Abby JimenezThe Worst Wingman Everand I felt exactly the same, as if the romance was a side plot and the problems and difficulties of the main characters the main. Don't get me wrong, I even liked how the author handled them here, but for the romance book it was supposed to be, the romance was actually my least favorite thing here.*Thank you to NetGalley for the advance copy in exchange for an honest review!*""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Forgot to update this but I LOVED IT just like I knew I would.

One big difference with Just For the Summer compared to her previous books...there is very little of the whole miscommunication trope--bonus points for me! The dual POV gives us a glimpse of two completely different stories, and lives, and slowly merges them into one complex, yet beautiful, story. One of friendship, forgiveness, healing, and the life changing realization that you ARE worthy of love! There were twists I was not expecting and not at all prepared for!!

The questionnaires that Justin made solely for Emma regarding dates were literally screaming 'if he wanted to, he would'.⌗ –“You’re just in a different place than I am—”“Then meet me where I am.”gosh I loved how many times he did things out of his comfort zone for her. HE PADDLED ON A FLOATIE FOR AN HOUR TO HER COTTAGE WHEN SHE WAS SICK. I don't even need to say more. He met her where she was.⌗ –“Maybe home isn’t a place. Maybe it’s a person.”I want to pull Emma out and hug her 🥲💗 Her traumas made me so emotional, the things she faced. She was definitely making practical choices when she didn’t want to stay, but I’m glad that Maddy was there to guide her and give her a reality check. It hurts, but still. i hate her mom sfm. I thought she had good moments and would redeem herself, but my bad. She sucked, and I want her in a dumpster pls.⌗ –“What’s wrong? Tell me what you’re thinking.”I paused. “I’m thinking I like you a lot more than you like me.”Their romance was cute, but they both had a lot of baggage. Justin was sometimes right about 'how his feelings for her are more than hers are for him,' and it was understandable from his pov, while Emma kind of struggled with her feelings. The breakup & his little anger after that was justifying, but I'm glad he understood her. The last moment when she told him she loved him, ugh 😭 their hug!!!!!!! I love them. 🧸🎀The epilogue was so cute fr 😭, and I'm so happy that their mom came back from prison after 2 years instead of 6. seriously, Justin taking care of his 3 siblings and talking about the responsibility was so hard. (him with Chelsea melted my heart ffs).him talking about his MOM BEING A SINGLE PARENT hit way too close to home.The words they used tore me up because it kind of helped me feel what my own mom must be feeling. nvm, this book had some great lessons innit.Maddy was harsh about her mom most of the time,and I kind of saw her as inconsiderate at the start, but tbh, i understand her.Telling someone one thing again and again and seeing them being hurt by it every freaking time is frustrating.You just can't let your friend or someone you love suffer like that. Not by anyone. Maddy literally stole my heart! 😭I was kind of rooting for Neil & his 'ex' (not knowing she was book 1's fmc), but when i found out what he did 💀 lmao. I'm glad the author didn’t give him his HEA, but he did change... nvm WHO GIVES A F?ᝰ.“Four dates. A kiss.

Another book that had me laughing and crying and cheering a couple on!With cameos from characters from the “Yours Truly” and “Part of Your World” an earlier two book series-I devoured this unputdownable book!And, the ending?

IYKYK, my reviews are always honest.writing:very mid |plot:okay |ending:THANK GOD |3.5 rounded upmy opinionFYI: this is insta-love with fade to bland grey spiceDespite the writing being extremely mid, I\'m tossing this 4 stars (3.5 rounded up) because Abby got my ass with Emma\'s character arc. I was INVESTED. If she hadn\'t extracted her head from delulu-land, I would\'ve given this one star so brace yourself while reading this. I honestly didn\'t give AF about the romance, I was on edge the entire time waiting to see how the dynamic between Emma and her ain\'t shit womb donor (mom) shook out. But seriously, Emma almost made me DNF because her toxic positivity was making my blood pressure skyrocket.The blurb leads you to believe this is a less misogynist Good Luck Chuck, but the curse storyline was ultimately insignificant. Also, if you really think about it, it makes no sense Emma would give up Hawaii for Minnesota (this felt like a crime) to break the relationship curse when her entire ""thing"" is she\'s constantly on the move and refuses to settle down. If she doesn\'t want to stay in one place, why does it matter that her exes find their soulmates after they break up? Seems like the curse was actually working in her favor because she never had to worry about ""the one that got away"". But I digress...This is my first Abby Jiminez that I completed (dnfed Yours Truly—no I won\'t be taking questions at this time) and I did find it funny. I liked the AITA post to kick things off and to tie it all together at the end.Random, but I\'ve noticed that authors are allergic to dialogue tags these days. Not all dialogue needs tags, but I find it odd that emotionally charged exchanges were devoid of them. It\'s giving interview transcript and I\'m not a fan of it. Feels lazy.No spoilies but I did like the conclusion of the book and I found the characters decently flushed out. Maddy is the fucking REALEST. She deserves ALLLLLLLL the good things in life. I hope her size is never sold out during sales, she never gets janky substitutions when ordering groceries online, and that her socks always match. She NEVER complained about Emma\'s selfishness; she was fiercely protective, patient, and endlessly selfless. Also, Justin\'s backstory was interesting. Definitely unique. Yes, the stress of his family situation was downplayed big time, but at least it was something different than the ""my mom died when I was young"" backstory that we usually see for MMCs. I think Justin was too good for Emma... He and Maddy should\'ve linked up together tbh.Usually I only share quotes that make me wanna gauge my eyes out with hot spoons but in this case, I\'m gonna share an excerpt that had me questioning if someone was cutting onions in close proximity of me:""You\'re not asking for too much. You were just asking the wrong person. Ask me instead.""Faaaacccttttsss though (within reason). Your ""too much"" for someone will be another person\'s bare minimum.All in all, this book kept my attention and threw me for a loop several times. I was ON EDGE. So I have no choice but to give Abby her flowers for taking me on a wild ass ride.pros & conspros: good character arc with Emma, Maddy is a real one, Justin was a likeable MMC (epitome of ""if he wanted to, he would"") with a unique backstory, strong resolution to Emma\'s story and their relationship, funny at times, interesting premise although not fully executedcons: very bland, emotionless writing... it was really the character\'s actions/beliefs that kept me emotionally involved, lack of dialogue tags during heated scenes watered things down, Emma\'s motivation to break the curse made no sense____Check out my YouTubeandmy TikTok'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '➳4.75⋆I.

And if it's helpful to anyone- I am not a fan of the first two books in this series and more or less was about to give up on Abby - it's nothing that she as an author is doing wrong. I've just found her stories to be a little too Hallmarky for my taste?Maybe not Hallmark, but just not my type of cheese?

She's determined and kind hearted despite everything she's been through.There's nothing exceptionally different with this rom-com in comparison to others- in the sense that much of it is predictable.

But i truly am not sure if i would have given this book five stars, if not for also readingpart of your world! so again, totally do whatever you wanna do, read these however you want to read them, but i just recommend reading at leastpart of your world(which is probably the best romance book i’ve read in years, so it will be a fun side quest, i promise)!now that that is out of the way - let me actually talk about the book itself! The basic premise is that a girl read a reddit post that makes her realize the poster and her have one thing in common: they both are the person people datebeforethey find their soulmates. So emma (28, traveling nurse) slides into justin’s (op, 29, engineer) about this curse they both may have, but then they start talking about other things and realize that they actually have more in common than their nonexistent love lives. they come up with a plan to maybe try to break this spell by dating each other on emma’s next traveling assignment, where she will come to minnesota where justin is at. and maybe, much like another book i loved this year -funny story, justin can convince emma to fall in love with his state, and maybe even want to set up some roots even though she lives a life constantly moving from place to place with her best friend.firstly, i love justin, i love emma, i wish them both the very best in life, but their friends, in particular maddy, oh they have my entire heart. this is a love story, without question, and this has a lot of heavy themes of grief and childhood neglect, but to me, this is a story about friendship, support systems, and being there for the people you love in life, no matter what. from justin’s friends knowing exactly what to do to lightening the weight in his life, to emma’s best friend maddy, who gave her so many different types of love throughout this book and truly is probably the best book friends i’ve ever read about in my life, to justin’s mom’s best friend who makes me cry even thinking about. this is just such a book about showing up for people, and also feeling like you trust people to show up for you, even when others in the past have made you a person who does not trust easily. these themes just really set this book apart for me, and is the reason this will be one of my favorite books of 2024.other things i loved: first dates with kittens!! questionnaires/google forms letting the person know what you like on dates! i know a lot of medical travelers and it was really cool reading a mc who does it! also, accurate med surg stereotype commentary, alongside accurate vegas stereotype commentary lol. you’re never too old to make new connections, and healthy relationships, with respected boundaries (romantically, but also with friends and family and anyone you choose to share your life with)!overall, if you’re looking for a really good romance, following two people healing from their pasts, both together and apart, and truly creating a healthy life for themselves, while also being such a love letter to friendships and all relationships (again, not just romantic ones), then please pick this up. i knew i was going to like this, but i didn’t expect to love it so very much and be impacted by the story so very deeply. and if you need a reminder, you are not the sum of the bad things in your past, especially stuff that was beyond your control. and it’s never too late to get the help, or extra resources, that you deserve. and you always deserve to live a healthier life, surrounded by people who appreciate you and love you unconditionally.lastly, abby - please give us the maddyand doug’sbook.

Justin and Emma think they are under a curse, everyone they date finds their one true love after a break up so they decide that maybe if they dated each other, that would break each other\'s curse, right?The first book I read by A. Jimenez was Yours Truly and I remember thinking that for a romance writer who leans more towards romcom, she explores too many medical trigger warnings, like maybe it would make sense if were typical contemporary romance because you\'d kind of expect that. Her covers get me and I pick them up because I want their romance to make me go ""awww too cute"" just the bright colors and smile a lot more than cry and have my anxiety triggered. I was worried when I read the description and trigger warnings for this book - panic attacks, anxiety, PTSD, depression, depictions of undiagnosed mental health issues, a toxic mother, and past child neglect.This managed to be still very cute and felt like a warm hug after therapy. I loved this storyline so much more. I loved the layers to the characters and the plot as well. It did not at all feel like the triggering contents overwhelmed the romance of the story to me and it had me invested in Justin and Emma, Maddy and Niel and Amber the whole time.***this is as much summer as I\'m going to get rn, I\'ll take it ☀️👙⛱️🌸💛'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'i REALLY liked this book—teetering between 4 and 4.5 stars. the more i sit with it, the more i miss it. especially you, Justin🥹i read this in under 24 hours and in two sittings. ate👏🏼it👏🏼up👏🏼 it was the perfect book for me at the perfect time. it doesn’t quite beat out THE FRIEND ZONE (my fave of hers) but it was good. maybe my second fave of hers?!? it’s time for an author ranking…this is the perfect romcom to head into spring/summer with, and a PERFECT beach or pool binge (i binged it outside this weekend). and the setting? the Midwest in the summer >>>my favorite thing about Abby Jimenez’ books are the side plots. she kind of reminds me of Katherine Center in that way—where the side plots are almost just as strong if not stronger than the romance / main plot. this was no exception!i also love how mature her characters are. maybe that’s a reflection of my age (31), but i’m here for the older 20s/early 30 romances where people are in similar stages of life to me. much more relatable, idk the younger characters just dont hit as hard for me now (which obv makes sense, except if you’re Magnolia Parks lolllll).this book was much deeper than i was expecting it to be, esp with the mom side plot. but i really applaud Abby for how she wrote and handled these delicate topics and characters. without spoiling anything, the third act breakup was actually really respectable and not an eye roll at all (which it typically is for me, iykyk).but like, is Justin everyone’s book bf now? bc he’s mineeeeeee. my goodness he was perfect 🥹 gentle and kind and caring and romantic and supportive. and i’m sure he was a SMOKEEEE lol😮\u200d💨chalk this up as a book i’d like to see adapted STAT!!!!'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3.25 Stars ★“Maybe home isn’t a place. Maybe it’s a person.”Abby has become an auto buy author for me since I enjoyed both Part of Your World and Yours Truly. However, this one let me down some.Just for the Summer is the third book in the Part of Your World series. What you will find is an online cute meet, dating pact, and some rom-com romance. As this has forced proximity, witty banter, and found family, that\'s not all. There is also Abby\'s typical mental health representation that she navigates with care. This had me giggling and kicking my feet to tears streaming down my face.Emma and Justin have something in common they are both essentially known as ""good luck charms."" Everyone they date ends up finding their soulmates once they break up. They come up with a plan to go on for dates, share a kiss, and break up. Their goal is to cancel out the streak and find their soulmates.Emma Grantis a travel nurse who doesn\'t stay long in one place, and she has her reasons. She is strong and kind-hearted, but don\'t let that fool you because she has years of emotional damage. Her trauma stems from abandonment and always believing the best in people. She tends to detach and distance herself from everyone when she feels stressed. I\'ll be honest that I didn\'t vibe with Emma a lot as she seemed immature to me. That is until all of her baggage started to unravel, and she began to realize why she was the way she was. I loved watching her growth once it started. I just wish that it would have been sooner.""Why not forgive? In a world where you can choose anger or empathy, always choose empathy.""Justin Dahlis sweet, caring, and funny. He is strong as well, and I can say that I appreciate his character. He goes through so much with changes that are happening to his life that are out of his control, but he deals with them as well as one can. He became a quick second to Jacob for me because, let\'s face it, Abby knows how to write a mmc that we all love and swoon over, and he is no exception.""I’ve been waiting my whole life to feel like this, and I thought it was a curse that nobody else ever worked out. But it wasn’t. It’s just that they weren’t you.”Emma and Justinstarted off as insta-love and didn\'t really move away from that, in my opinion. This is what didn\'t work for me the most as it\'s a romance book, and I myself didn\'t feel it until towards the end. Don\'t get me wrong, they had their cute moments, but I wanted tension and chemistry. Justin was putting forth into the relationship, but it didn\'t feel like Emma was, which I can understand in some sense. It just felt very one-sided. I can say that they were good at communicating. The romance made an appearance when Emma caught up to Justin, but I would have liked to feel it much sooner than the last 25%. I did love the surveys that he sent her with options. I am always indecisive, especially on things to do or go eat, and this would help me to choose.“Four dates. A kiss. No breakup.”“Not just for the summer?”“No. Forever this time.”If it\'s one thing AJ definitely knows how to write, it\'s the found family. I was eating it up like candy. I loved Maddy and how she kept it so real and told it like it is. It has me excited for her book.The ending was cute, but again, I was a bit disappointed. It felt rushed to me, especially after the conflict that, in a way, it felt necessary for Emma to grow. I just would have liked to see more of them working on any of their issues together as in real life things just don\'t mend themselves back together magically. I really enjoyed the easter eggs that were sprinkled throughout. A couple of them literally left me with my jaw dropped. While I didn\'t love this, it was still enjoyable. I look forward to reading more of her work as stated before she has become a favorite.Quotes and favorite moments""Sometimes the best way to show love or be kind to someone is to meet them where they are.”“Unhealed trauma is a crack. And all the little hard things that trickle into it that would have rolled off someone else, settle. Then, when life gets cold, that crack gets bigger, longer, deeper. It makes new breaks.""“Let’s be very clear here. I am not the obstacle in the way of your happiness. That person is you.”""Four dates, one kiss, and a breakup. Just for the summer.""“You’re not asking too much,” he said. ""You were just asking the wrong person. Ask me instead.”""Maddy was like a first responder for my soul. She always had been.

And ever since being forced into the Cauldron and becoming High Fae against her will, she's struggled to find a place for herself within the strange, deadly world she inhabits. Worse, she can't seem to move past the horrors of the war with Hybern and all she lost in it.The one person who ignites her temper more than any other is Cassian, the battle-scarred warrior whose position in Rhysand and Feyre's Night Court keeps him constantly in Nesta's orbit. But her temper isn't the only thing Cassian ignites. The fire between them is undeniable, and only burns hotter as they are forced into close quarters with each other.Meanwhile, the treacherous human queens who returned to the Continent during the last war have forged a dangerous new alliance, threatening the fragile peace that has settled over the realms. And the key to halting them might very well rely on Cassian and Nesta facing their haunting pasts.Against the sweeping backdrop of a world seared by war and plagued with uncertainty, Nesta and Cassian battle monsters from within and without as they search for acceptance-and healing-in each other's arms.","[{'rating': 1, 'content': '✨hardcore Nesta and Cassian fans need not engage. shoo !!✨She drew up short. “I’m not afraid of anything.”but you will be afraid of me when I rant about you. bitch.Now on to the point which is this book. Oh, this book. Oh, this damn, freaking pathetic book. This has been: One of the worst experiences of my life. I\'m freaking salty and I need a refund of my expectations.Let me make something clear. This book actually made me realize that iusedto like the original trilogy a lot. But - SJMruined every. single. thing.She ruined everything good about those precious, loveable books and characters. So, now I just hate everyone 😊Now, what are the actual good things in this book you may askanything that is not Cassian, Nesta, Mor, Amren, Feyre, Rhysand• LUCIEN• AZRIEL•He said Feyre Darling and she told him no goodbyes Rhys• the endThis book was entriely useless. Things this book has include:• cringey talk• Nesta and Cassian (what\'s their ship name?) scaring me to death.• bad, horribly redundant writing• Nesta\'s inner fire blah blah• Nesta eating my brain•Cassian\'s cock rubbing against the seam of his pantsevery two pages (literally i\'m not even joking)• bad sex• Nesta screaming about how she sucks• mate• Nesta thinking she owns the world• everyone looking at Nesta and falling to their knees (hulk smash)• everyone looking at Nesta and sayingmother save you(i will gouge my eyes out if i have to read ""mother save you"" ever again)• Nesta getting a new superpower every 50 pages. i mean it.• NESTA AND CASSIAN BEING OH SO PRETTY• a lot of boring girl talk• Cassian and Nesta doing it everywhere• boring Nesta things which i skipped• Nesta being a bitch the entire book and doing inexcusable shit and then apologizing in the last 50 pages or sth and suddenly everyone forgives herrr• some boring side characters• an absolutely boring plotline (non-existent is a better word)• and as soon as things between Nesta and Cassian are resolved, the plot was dissolved into thin airBasically, this book sucked. badly. I wanted to crawl into a freaking hole and die. My eyes are literally bleeding from the amount of stupidity in this book.AND THE SIMILARITIES I CAN DRAW BETWEEN THIS BOOK AND ACOMAF(but let\'s be real ACOMAF is superior with a really good plotline, an actual love letter for people to heal, good chemistry, excellent characters and with an amazing ending).Firstly - Nesta and Cassian:Nestaaaaaaaaaaaa. THE BITCH. She did nothing, nothing while Feyre provided for them AND STILL, SHE BLAMES EVERY SINGLE PERSON. Like she was mad that Feyre found a new family but basically Nesta did everything in her power to push Feyre out of the picture when they were human. I do get it that some people protect themselves by using angry words or whatever BUT to me she just seemed like aselfish bitch. And when everyone finally grew sick of her bullshit she\'s like: oh my god everyone hates me.Yes, I do. I do hate you.(Update:Someone told me i was being disrespectful towards people who suffer from PTSD. Well, it certainly wasn\'t what I was saying but if, in anyway, my words have hurt you then I\'m extremely sorry.BUT Nesta\'s PTSD doesn\'t justify her behavior. Let me take an example from this book. Isn\'t tam-tam suffering from PTSD? But the way she treated him? Was that perfectly fine? The point is that this isn\'t only about her PTSD. She wasn\'t suffering from such a thing before going into the Cauldron. If you read ACOTAR from the beginning, you\'ll see what kind of character Nesta was from page 1. If she treated other people suffering from depression like Feyre, Tamlin, oh the way she talks to Lucien then how can anyone even expect that I give her space - when she doesn\'t give that to others?)and just to show her ✨superior powers✨we are constantly told that:• Amren shivered (ohhh scary)• her power ... is death herself (dramatic much?)• Rhysand\'s face grew white (*eye roll*)• Mother save you all (okay but pls shut up with that line)At this point, I am fucking begging SJM on my knees to stop making every single person in her world the epitome of power.and her POV was so boring. IS THIS CHARACTER GROWTH? :’) I could watch the grass grow instead of this. It was so bland after she had mentioned about 1000 times in only the first 200 pages thatshe is angry. Okay we get it. Now stop. But sadly Nesta didn\'t stop. All she could think about was: Cassian\'s cock, how unworthy she is (for his cock),the fire within her wanting to burstttttt or sth. ffs. I have never read a book more redundant than this.We were at the 600+ page mark and still Nesta didn’t change ONE BIT. All her character growth came out of the blue in the last 50 pages which just felt like the dumbest, most miserable attempt at making her seem better (it failed btw).the girl said to Elain:“Spare me the bullshit, please.”I read in a review that Elain didn\'t try to help Nesta. SHE DID. She was there for her. but Ms. Prissy Princess was too into herself to see that. And then she kept raving about Elain choosing Feyre yeah yeah shut up.and she literally said Cassian tastes like crackling embers?? C R A C K L I N G E M B E R S. and then fire roared in her blood and there was an extremely cringey makeout scene after that. Oh, the sex scenes were so cringey, i skipped them whole 😌✊and then there’s Cassian. I used to LIKE Cassian, I LIKED his jokes and attitude.But SJM being SJM turned him from an interesting character into a sex addict. He makes such stupid jokes the entirety of the book, and there is a single thought in his head: his cock. 👏👏👏 he has zero sense, idk why people even like him in this book. I was so sick of reading every two minutes that he wants to fuck Nesta OKAY WE GET IT NOW MOVE ON THINK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. MY GOOD SIR YOU ARE A GENERAL OF AN ARMY OF THE BIGGEST COURT IN PRYTHIAN. DO YOU SERIOUSLY NOT HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO DO?Secondly – the plot that never was:Their world used to be so interesting to me and I don’t gaf what anyone else says, the entire concept of courts and worlds and gahh I loved it and I wanted to know more about it.But instead of discovering more about this world, we spend 700 pages reading Nessian fucking each other in every position instead of discovering more about this world. I WISH the plot was given the attention it needed but sadly – it wasn’t. Basically, everything that happened in the (non-existent) plot was to give Nesta more superpowers *rolls eyes*This is in no way a fantasy, even labeling it as such is an atrocity. NOTHING HAPPENS IN TERMS OF PLOT.Thirdly - Rhysand:And then there\'s the elephant in the room.Rhysand. I cannot for the life of me believe this is the same person from the previous books. If a man treated me the way Rhysand treated the women around him in this book, i would eat him alive. And this is a major statement coming from me since I loved Rhysand to the point of pasting his face all over my house and I spent all my teenage years worshipping on his shrine.SJM gave his character a 180 degree turn from the man we all met and fell in love with in ACOMAF. Is this the same man who helped Feyre heal in ACOMAF? YOU\'RE ACTUALLY TELLING ME THAT RHYSAND WOULD DO THIS TO FEYRE? Do y\'all remember chapter 54 of ACOMAF? Do y\'all remember all the things he did for her? How in seven hells is this the same person?I will never in a million lifetimes forgive SJM for destroying one of my favourite characters. A character i genuinely loved, a character i cried over, a character itrusted- now forever destroyed. RIP Rhysand.And this isn\'t just the problem with Rhysand. SJM made the entire Inner Circle go from people who suffered and were full of empathy for others to these immature childish bastards whose sole purpose is to somehow berate Nesta.Conclusion:Lucien and Azriel are the only good things left in this book, they are my precious babies whom i will protect till the day i die AND IF SOMEONE SAYS ONE BAD THING ABOUT LUCIEN AGAIN, YOU BETTER BELIEVE I WILL RIP THE FABRICS OF THE WORLD TO EAT THAT PERSON ALIVE.I\'ve said it before, i\'ll say it again. Mass is not a bad writer. I love her ToG series (her superior series btw). She\'s good when she wants to be and I just wish she bothered writing ACOSF and writing Nesta’s character and her journey in a more believable way.You can\'t argue with the fact that Nesta is a pretty toxic character whose redeeming qualities came at about page 600+ after doing inexcusable shit the entirety of the book and for me that\'s too late. And then there\'s the matter of everyone around her being so fuckingdisgusting, i don\'t even know who I dislike more.What this world needs is for these 500-year-old hooligans (who haven’t learnt a single thing in their entire millennia of living) to step aside and let ME rule the Night Court (I’d be a better leader than any of them anyway) with Azriel by my side.Let\'s just hope the next book is A HUGE BOOK ABOUT AZRIEL because no one deserves it more than him 😭 Pls SJM give him the book he deserves.------------that cover is 2020 in the flesh'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Spoilers hidden because I’m not a dickThis review gonna be a lili bit of raving about this book by itself VS ranting how it was as a continuation of Maas’s seriesHonestly, my biggest challenge going into this book was all my preconceptions of this world and its characters.The stakes were high.Cassianis one of the biggest favorites in the fandomWhereas Nesta has a reputation for being a....So going into it, the book was better when I tried to block out all the nasty shit in previous books and high expectations.This isn’t the start of a new ✨Maas✨series, just a standalone romance happening in same world.I highly recommend that mindset cuz then it's less disappointing. Moving on,꧁The Characters꧂I have never likedNesta Acheron. sorry not sorry. I didn’t like her much in the previous books but I acknowledge that her character has potential for such depth that Maas really tried to develop here.But did it work?Typically these characters dynamics would usually have me ✨screaming✨with a bloodthirsty heroine and spitfire cocky guy who always comes back for her!!I’ve always loved Cassian. But i didnt*quite*love his POV.I felt like thru an attempt of making his character more dimensional, we lost some of his key characteristics as the flirtatous badasswho uses humor and adrenaline to cope... Yes it was amazing getting insight into his thoughts and Maas’s writing style easily adopted this dual perspective. I just wish we got more of the Cassian that trained Freye and let her punch out as needed while cracking jokes at Rhysands expensive.Maas is known for her growling, purring, overprotective, asshole, alpha males. BUT I LOVEEE ITTTTAnd his relationship with Nesta was so well developed. He knows Nesta as a victim, killer, broken girl, self-sufficient woman, and general badass.He's seen it alll and he keeps coming back for her.Together, these two were the perfect combination fora hot chaotic relationshipthat had you swooning, cackling, and gasping.I don't think Nesta will ever be my fav characterhowever her story really speaks to mental health for someone who reacts/protects themselves with sharp words and angerSome describe Nesta as ambitious and authoritative character but to me she was veryselfish, cold, and distant. She did nothing to help Feyre provide for their family and spent the money Freye earned on frivolous items. THEN in fey world went on whole refusing to train/ help others but demanding they protect ONE of her sisters?!*fuck off*In this book, She*finally*had moments of -well i’m tired of not being able to protect myself. LIKE YES BITCH THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL BEEN SAYING THIS WHOLE TIMESo on that element, I was sooo glad she was actually making progress and decisions!At the same time, I found myself disappointed with the Inner Circle*gasp*I know, I was sad about it too. I understood why they were done with her shit. Because, same.But the constant bashing of Nesta's drinking, sex, and weight were low blows especially compared to the violence and weight loss Freyre went thru. hypocrites much? I fully recognize this isn’t reflective of the characters we knowbut its Nesta’s perspective of the charactersacting towards her...*Shrug*꧁The Maas Quality꧂Honestly, sad to report no major twists. It was just a really good, borderline dark, romance driven by character development and lottttasexy sexy fun timessince its not longer YAIf I had just randomly picked this up, then this book would’ve been off the charts with such dynamic characters, beautiful worldbuilding, and an okay plot.But in comparison with her others, this book seemed kinda basic and was missing some intricate detail plot twists that you usually can count on with Maas.To sum up it was an epic story of redemption-- Of a girl finding herself again after tragedy. And along the way she makes friends, and a lover who listens to her who supports her rough recovery, and not always her actions.Somehow this book felt soooo long and overly descriptive.. but also was not enough. No idea how that happens but there it is.The next threat/enemy makes logical sense. So I liked thatI wanted Nesta to get fierce FOR her sisters and be finally willing to fight FOR them. I lovesome badass sisters dynamicsof teasing each other, bitching at each other but would do anything for each other in the end!Didn't really quite get that.I was constantly underwhelmed by Nesta. She talks lotta shit but what has she actually done?She has continuously refused to show initiative in her own life and failed to provide for herself. Instead, she constantly chose to lean on the resources of others for her survival.All she has done is complain.Complainabout her human life while refusing to work and save herself or her sisters.Complainabout the happiness her lili sister found while refusing to be part of it.Complainabout the only people willing to fight and save humans while refusing to train or learn to fight FOR HERSELF.iM bOrEd and AnGeReD by the dismissive bullshit that defined her character up to this point in the seriesThis book showed some sparks of greatness! Taking initiative in her life! Using all that spitfire and backbone to make something for herself! But in the end, it kinda failed to live up to the fierce powerful Nesta I was hoping she would transform into.Reading this book you can’t help but compare to Maas’ other great heroines.I think the big difference is that Aelin always kept moving forward. And Bryce was a little shit. But Nesta handled her depression by freezing and becomingnasty.Which is just really hard to read sometimes.Overall, I’m glad I read this book but it won’t be a major re-read like most Maas books. The book stands on the friendship the characters build, Nesta overcoming her despair and FINALLY developing her interesting powers. I greatly enjoyed the character dynamics of how Cassian and Nesta are such strong complex characters, but I wanted their romance to be more epic and to sweep me away. I love this world and all the creatures and BADASS FEMALE WARRIORS but the plot was lacking and I hate the power change that a lot of Maas’ characters are undergoing.If you are teetering whether to read this book, I gotta tell you to lower your expectations and try to forget the bullshit of Nesta’s past in order to just fully enjoy this book. It was pretty great seeing the Inner Circle’s relationships in the aftermath of Wings and Ruin, especially through Nesta’s harsh eye that hardcore READS THESE BITCHES and all their flaws. Plus it gives some foreshadowing and builds excitement for which characters might be next.It was a good romance, but it wasn’t a great Maas book.ALSO I’M STIL FRIGGEN PISSED ABOUT THAT COVER-------------------------------------------------------------------------Pre-Book thoughtsI have never likedNesta.sorry not sorry. I didn’t like her much in the previous books but I acknowledge that her character does have potential for such depthSome describe Nesta as ambitious and authoritative character but to me she was veryselfish, cold, and distant. She did nothing to help Feyre provide for their family and spent the money Freye earned on frivolous items. THEN in fey world goes on whole refusing to train/ help others but demanding they protect ONE of her sisters?!*fuck off*Just the idea of a sister knowingly fucking over another in how she treated Freyre as human for YEARS ... it actually hurts my heart a little bit .... that kinda selfishnessBut Cassian liking her will probably MAKE me like her more*god i hope so cuz he deserves the best*I just sick of Nesta's unrelenting nastiness while also hoping she resolves her trauma and that Cassian finds the happiness he deservesWish listIt’d be kinda cool to find out that she was doing something—sacrificing—to help the familythat Freyre never knewback when they were humans behind the wallShe just needsSOME redeeming qualityfor all the times she constantly bitching and lashing out at everyone. Some reason for why the whole Cassian ignoring thing and treating her sis Feyre like dirt*shaking my fucking head*Also generally she way 2 protective and angry towards people for there not to be some sorta backstory or event behind it hahahCover:ehhh I not really a fan of this style... also don’t think it really suited for Cassian with the hardcore Autumn court theme and colors. This just seems like such a let-down and step-down compared to the artful creativity and beauty of Crescent City*frowny face*But its Maas so of courseeeee imma read it*duhhhh*""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""EDIT: this kind of blew up so I just wanted to say that if you're one of those people writing essays in the comment section to try to change my mind: I don't care lol 😭 good for you for being passionate about something but I'm not here to read a think piece on why you disagree, stream red velvet tho xThe following will contain major spoilers.Nobody is surprised. I knew absolutely nothing would make this book good, save SJM deciding not to write it altogether.Now, I have to make it clear upfront: IloveNesta. I really resonate with the way that she deals with her own emotions and is consequently treated by the people around her. That being said, I loathe SJM’s books. I only begrudgingly pushed through this for Nesta, and even that wasn’t worth it.Nothingcould have made this worth it.I’m not here to give a criticism of the plot or politics, because I’m sure nobody cares (I don’t). I’m also not here to judge the sex aspect of this book, although I know many people have chosen to critique that. Instead, I’d like to cover the three cardinal sins this book committed:respect, rebirth, and rhysand.RespectACOSF starts off with our heroine using drinking and sex as her coping mechanism. The third book in the ACOTAR trilogy left our main characters, especially Nesta, heavily traumatized. She witnessed her good-for-nothing father come back after he didnothingfor her or her sisters as children and try to fight Hybern. She watches as he dies in front of her. She watches as thousands of Illyrian soldiers die. She watches as Cassian is nearly killed multiple times in front of her. She’s underweight, depressed, has PTSD, and gets shit all because of it.No, in fact, she’spunishedfor it.The straw that broke the camels back is the fact that she spent 500 gold on beer and gambling. Now, the problem isn’t that she drank or gambled. It’s that she used this money-which is HILARIOUS considering that Rhysand owns five houses and pays each Inner circle member a salary that is so grotesquely huge it’s described in previous books as being more than they’ll ever need in their lifetimes. Rhysand is even completely fine with the fact that Velaris is full of so-called “slums” but oh, no, NESTA can’t be living in one! It’s fine if poor people exist, she’s just not allowed to be one of them because it’s “embarrassing” to them. Obviously, they cut her off completely, DESTROYED the entire neighborhood she lived in (has anyone wondered what the fuck happened to the other people living there lmao? are they just homeless now?), and ship her off to a sexist, homophobic war camp with the one person she doesn’t want to be around because being depressed is just /such/ a sin.She is repeatedly berated by every member in the court. Some lovely examples:>Cassian tells her that everyone “fucking hates (her)” and later makes this out to be “oh, I just said that but I didn’t really mean it.”>During one of their sex scenes she asks him if his friends won’t be angry with him for sleeping with her because she’s so aware of the fact that they hate her.>“Perhaps you can find it in yourself to try a little harder this year.”>He jokes that she might order him to kill himself, and she asks him if he really thinks she’s capable of that. Because this entire time they’ve made her feel like sheisa monster.>Mor tells her that she “never deserved the benefit of the doubt that good people like (Cassian) give her” and also says that she should be thrown into the court of nightmares. For anyone unaware, the court of nightmares is where her homophobic and abusive family is.>Amren constantly makes fun of her appearance and berates her for having sex. She tells her she looks awful at every opportunity, and always chalks it up to be because she sleeps around and drinks too much.>Rhysand gets his own section for abhorrent comments.There is no end to it. Every chapter brought a character insulting her for justexisting.Her weight problems are described fucking atrociously. The first time Cassian even sees her in the book he comments on how she’s “skin and bones” but guys, he still wants to tap that. Every time her weight is mentioned is either to insult her for starving herself because, need I remind you, she’s DEPRESSED, or it’s for Cassian to point out while he talks about how hot she is.All of this. All 768 pages of insult after insult after humiliation and pointless paragraphs forNestato apologize tothem.Because it’s /her/ fault she’s depressed. It’s /her/ fault she has PTSD. It’s /her/ fault and she needs to change for everyone else. Because everyone forced her to leave against her will because theylovedher, something they make sure to remind her of every single damn chapter. Nesta is disrespected by everyone throughout the entire book and is rewarded for it by being the one who must respect them instead.RebirthYou have no idea how excited I was back when I was an ACOTAR fan and Nesta was rebirthed as a High Fae and got her powers from the cauldron. It was like watching someone so similar to me-someone who was mean, and opinionated, andboldhold all the power in the world. I wanted to see how SJM would write her journey of becoming physically and mentally strong-of mastering her powers.We see glimpses of it. How her eyes shine with fire. How she sears the stairs she walks on with a single finger. The light emanating from her. The way she is single-handedly more powerful than Rhysand, who was said to be the strongest High Lord. It was incredible.And then she gave it all up.That’s it. Journey’s over. She gave up all of the power she had, but not before using it to mutate her pelvis so that she would be able to birth an Illyrian baby without dying.Yeah. That’s all.RhysandI have never met a character whom I loathe more than Rhysand. Perfect, feminist king Rhysand who loves giving women a choice so long as they pick the one he wants them to. He’s the most worthless, pathetic, egomaniac asshole I’ve ever read about. His name is mentioned 791 times, which is 791 times too many.It’s made very clear from the get-go that he hates Nesta. He’s aggressive toward her in a way that makes me want to strangle him every time he speaks. Every comment toward her or about her is an ill-intended remark.Nesta makes what he knows of him clear early on: “Any offering Rhysand threw her way was solely out of love for Feyre.”Wait for it, things are about to get comedic.When Nesta finds out about Feyre’s pregnancy, Rhysand looks at her threateningly, because of course he thinks she’s a danger to his kid. It says, “Rhysand was not only male, but a Fae male, and he would eliminate any threats to his mate and child.”Here comes the funny part—Absolutely hilarious to me that Rhysand wants to be the white vanilla king who loves women (and is definitely not misogynistic) and his wife SO MUCH that he hid from her the fact that her giving birth could potentially kill her.Oh yeah!Because wanting to protect your mate (gag) involves lying to her about her own body and child. He strictly forbids anyone tells her about it, so, naturally, Nesta tells her.Now, I’m not going to sit here and pretend like she had good intentions. She was just doing it to be an ass. But at least she told the god damn woman that the kid inside of her was going to KILL HER! And then, Feminist king Rhysand declared, and-I-quote, “Get Nesta out of this city. Right now. Before I fucking kill her.”Round of applause for our cracker saltine lord ruler Rhyse Hall, everybody.I have no other words. No words for how every single time Nesta dared to stand up to the awful way she was treated by him Cassian would get angry ather.As if Rhys was some infallible God who could do no wrong and must never be criticized. No matter how large his wrongdoing was, it was always her fault. Always her who was the problem.I just feel like...I don't know. I like Cassian, or I did, at least. I think that a good love interest should both support the heroine and call her out when she's being a dick, but relentlessly siding against her is just so ??? What's even the point? His entire family hates her guts, and he doesn't do much to make her think otherwise or to comfort her about it. He definitely doesn't act like he doesn't share some of their views. I don't see how a male lead placing his family over his girl could be very romantic?Concluding thoughts and my 13th reasonThis is the worst book Sarah J Maas has ever written, and that’s saying a lot. From her worthless white feminism to the complete and utter mind-numbing torture I had to face through this Bible-length tome, I could not have thought of a worse thing to read. It’s sad because I truly love Nesta Archeron so much, but this book made it evident that Sarah Janet hates her and wants to give her the worst story ever. Also, Feysand baby had a stupid name. SorryEDIT:frequently asked questions so that you can stop asking them:Why would you read something you know you'll hate?It's a free country! Why did you read this entire review if you knew you would hate it? (Yes, I /am/ a miserable person. I enjoy writing hate reviews. I think it's funny)It's a fiction book, it doesn't need to be realistic.By mistreating mental illness and eating disorders in fiction you perpetuate the idea in real life. The thing is, writing about something is not an endorsement, but neither is it a condemnation. SJM could have written about these situations in a way that was respectful, but, at least in my opinion, she completely missed the mark. I'm not saying she shouldn't have written about Nesta's mental health and weight issues. I'm saying that the way she wrote about them made it seem like they were just...her fault? Do you know what I mean? Like, as someone who has received comments about my weight many times, I felt deeply uncomfortable by how people treated her.If that's what you think then what do you think about... (enter character/ship I didn't mention)?I like Gwen? I don't have any further thoughts.Do you think having mental illness excuses someone to be a bad person?Mental illness is an explanation, not an excuse. It /explains/ why Nesta wants to be left alone. It /explains/ why she has a hard time being around anyone in the Inner Circle. It /explains/ her complicated feelings toward them. Nesta was already a mean person before this book—the actual question is whether or not any of her rude behaviorneedsto be excused in the first place. And that's for you to think on. Personally, I don't care.What Red Velvet song?All of them!""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5 - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️It feels like coming home after a long journey.That is precisely what I feel whenever I read aSarah J Maasbook. WhileThrone of Glassis my favorite series butACOTARis special to me. It helped me during one of the most difficult periods of my life and in particular,ACOMAF.I have no words to describe the beautiful familiarity of returning to a world you know you have always missed.I swear I could almost feel the gentle breeze of Velaris caressing me, welcoming me back while knowing that the story will start from a very dark place.Because this isNesta\'sstory.In the beginningAnd in the endThere was DarknessAnd nothing more.I will be writing two sections of the review soon:• a non-spoiler section that will come first• a spoiler section because I DO need to highlight some points.----------Non-spoiler review----------Nesta\'shealing journey was not a smooth one. I did not expect it to be. She clawed her way out of the the darkness that engulfed her ever since she had turned into a Fae.For her to heal, Nesta had to rip her soul apart to find her self again.I will tell you that I disliked Nesta so much in the ACOTAR books, I just kept a tight hold on the grudge against her.But Nesta is not a person that was meant to be liked. She is vicious and her sharpest weapon has always been her tongue. She could inflict a wound so deep with a mere word. But I came to realizeNesta is the most ""human"" character among all of them.Humanity does not equal good morals necessarily, Nesta is heavily flawed and her flaws are what makes her human.She is guilt-ridden to the point she allows her guilt to rot within her, poisoning most of the traits that makes her a good person. She carries such a deep disdain towards herself that she acts on it and you often see it in the form of lashing words.Why does she allow this to happen to her? Because she holds onto one belief:She deserves it.When I started seeing Nesta\'s soul more clearly after she began to tear it open, I felt my soul resonate with hers to the point that I cried.She was a prisoner in her own head, reliving certain deaths and nightmares that she can no longer see the light in the world. She can no longer see the goodness in her.It was powerful. It was raw. It was ugly.It was devastatingly beautiful in a way.That is what Nesta\'s healing looked like. She was such a damaged person inside that she gave up on the hope of healing herself.Does that mean all is forgotten about Nesta\'s past behavior? About the fact that she hurt and wronged many people? That she at many moments was a horrid person?The answer is No, and this is what makes Nesta\'s healing journey so impactful and emotional.Her trauma after the Cauldron and the War wrapped its adamant chains around her. The devastating war still haunts her and pulls her back from that light at the end of the tunnel where her family await her, a family that are bent on believing that she chose to remain in the darkness.No one was willing to go deep into the darkness to her and gift her a fragment of light that will guide her steps out.No one was willing to go as far as to shatter those chains and spare her from that misery.No one except forCassian.Nesta and Cassian\'s romance was maddening, passionate and wild.They were feral with each other, they were mad for one another, they were perfect for each other. I expected no less of them.Sarah J Maaswas not kidding when she mentioned that this was the filthiest book she has written so far.I was very impressed with her writing style, I really enjoy seeing an author\'s journey throughout the years and how much they grow. Of course, ACOSF comes with its own set of flaws and issues but it does not ruin the overall experience for me.If it shredded my emotions, if it made me cry, if my heart felt attached to this world after turning the very last page. It deserves a 5-star rating from me regardless of the issues and flaws that I will highlight in the spoiler section.Not to mention now that I adore Nesta, I adore the person she had become in the end and this is coming from a person that never liked her in the previous books.A Court of Silver Flamesis sexy, emotionally gripping and powerful.WARNINGI will go into detail about the book in the other section of this review below which will contain MAJOR SPOILERS, so please this is a heads up for those that have not read the books to not continue further unless they are willing to be spoiled.--------MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD--------Spoiler-review:The following review will be summed up in points because this is the best way to sort my thoughts and make sure I left nothing out.Yes people I am about to let it all out.Also, this is my own experience and my opinion should not be treated as a fact. To each of us their own unique reading experiences. I do not want to ruin anyone\'s experience and I do not want someone to ruin mine.So, let\'s get on with it!*ACOSF\'sbackbone wasNestaand her found family:Gwyn and Emerie. I adore their precious bond and the fact that they are badass female characters whom are also passionate readers of smutty romances. I love that Nesta found other friends outside the IC, they all found something in each other and helped one another heal.* TheHouseis my new favorite character.* Unpopular opinion but I am glad to seeRhysandplaying the High Lord role. Of course we\'d find him to be more broody since we are no longer seeing him fromFeyre\'sperspective, we are seeing him in his true element. I\'ve noticed that a few readers said they didn\'t like Rhys in this book, well.. Rhysand isn\'t the epitome of perfection many make him out to be and I appreciate that because he is heavily flawed too and yes I do like Rhysand.* My heart bursts with so much love forCassian! He wasn\'t without flaws too but I finally saw the raw version of him.* Although I was in no rush to seeFeyre\'spregnancy, yet it warmed my heart because Feyre deserves that kind of happiness after everything she went through. Of course I cried when she announced that she was pregnant I already suspected it early on.* It\'s refreshing to see theInner Circlefrom two other perspectives especially Nesta\'s and their treatment of her as if she was a hopeless case. Not saying that Nesta wasn\'t at fault here but they too are not cutting her some slack.* I think in regards to theromanceI have a few things I want to address: there were some romantic scenes that felt repetitive from ACOMAF + the intimate scenes were sometimes spicy in a good way and sometimes sloppy with weird descriptions.* I loved seeingNesta\'sgrowth because it was beautiful and ugly at the same time and you can easily notice the shifting points in her healing.* I rolled my eyes at theNessianmating bond, sorry everyone. I let it slip because I grew fond of them both but I do not want the romance to always be attached to some invisible bond. It\'s supposed to be rare we already had that with Rhys and Feyre.* Theplotdid not feel stable, it felt like it went to so many different directions. I was kind of hoping there would be more politics and human queens involved but it\'s not like I wasn\'t happy to where it ended up.* I was missing the open-conversation I was looking forward to between Nesta and the Inner Circle, both acknowledging their wrongs.* The rareRed starblasting through the sky that rattled Rhys, freaked out Cassian and the Priesstesses is none other thanAelin!.* Can we talk about the fact thatHelionwanted to enter the Night Court in a Golden Chariot led by four white horses with manes of golden fire and Rhys was like no so he settled for a Pegasus still having the best entrance of any character in the book.* the whole High King situation is a big No No. I love the dynamic of the Seasonal and Solar Courts and that what makes Prythian unique. Making Rhys a High King would ruin that and the fact that each Court is associated with its High Lord\'s power. I\'ve had it with Rhys beingthe most powerful high lord in historyso I do not need him to be upgraded to a High King especially not with using weapons that are the products of Nesta\'s power. That\'s giving Rhys way more power.* The scene that hit me the most was when Nesta let it all out. I cried because I am familiar with that level of self-loath.* I cried at the scene when Feyre was giving birth, it was intense and so emotional. Deep down I knew SJM wouldn\'t just end it here but it did not stop my heart from breaking.* The aftermath was so precious.* I do not mind thatNestalost the power she took from the Cauldron. She will lead the Valkyries whom she revived with her two other friends. She will grow even stronger without relying on powerful magic that makes her a target of other enemies. Her power has been a heavy weight lifted off her shoulders, and she gave them away in the most emotional and beautiful way.* Unpopular opinion: I have no issues withAzriel\'s POVbecause this is the first time we are exposed to his thoughts and he definitely was not OOC. Azriel is not some dark cinnamon roll, he is a deep inner turmoil. I find his notion of love and thoughts of Elain to be unhealthy. He has no experience with love besides the 500 year old unrequited love for Mor which brings me to ask... how come Az would get over Mor, his 500 year old crush just for Elain? They have not even spoken about their feelings. Anyhow, I do believe Azriel to be at a very dark place and it saddens me that many readers disliked him after this. Azriel has always kept to himself, he was never brought into the light, he does not know what love truly is. Having an Archeron sister does not guarantee the happiness his brothers found, this is a very wrong mindset.* Yes, I\'ve said it before and I\'ll say it again:Azrielneeds a ray of sunshine kind of character and we find that inGwyn. I think she is perfect for him and there is a reason SJM gave her the spotlight in his POV. Her name literally means happiness, blessing, white, fair while Az\'s is God is my help and Azrael the Angel of Death. Such a stark contrast, like yin and yang.* I hope SJM won\'t useGwyn, a SA survivor, as a plot-device for Elriel and then discard her that is too cruel.* Yes, not all Illyrian brothers should end up with every Archeron sister so I\'ll be rooting for Azriel and Gwyn in the next book.* Also, many people calledRhysa hypocrite for his actions with Azriel. No, what he did makes sense and he is pulling rank because this is how Rhys asserts his role as High Lord with a responsibility toward his court. Az ignored the Mor question, Az did not express his love or feelings towards Elain only his desire to have her and I\'m pretty sure there would\'ve been a different reaction from Rhys if Az told him that he genuinely loves her. With a baby on the way, Rhys won\'t risk any more conflicts that targets him and his family nor will he risk alliances with the other courts because of Azriel. How many times throughout the books did Rhys ask something of Azriel like to stop spying or not engage in a battle and he refuses until Rhys pulls the High Lord act on him and tells him that\'s it\'s anorder, people forget how stubborn Azriel can be.* I appreciate the fact that this book gave us a new perspective to theInner Circleand their flaws. I still adore them.I may add points later on, I\'m not quite sure I covered everything but I hope I did.Another note I would add is please be careful with posting spoilers in the comments. Try to be vague about it because it will still show on Goodreads feed to other readers that haven\'t read the book.Remember that this is my own personal experience of the book and my own personal opinions that in no way invalidate your own, so please do not invalidate mine if you do not agree with it.ACOMAF remains at the top but ACOSF managed to take over the second place, I will definitely be rereading it some time in the future.This is the longest review I have written so far, so thank you for sticking around.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '*This review contains no spoilers.*(very scared and had to edit my review after i pressed control + f and saw how many times i used the word ""fuck""). i have grammatically de-fucked this review. enjoy.)Ranting and RavingLet\'s get one thing clear: I am a hard core SJM fan. I have read and loved every book this woman has ever written. But can I be real a second? This book was shit, and I hated everything.CharactersI hatedevery single personin this book. Well, except Azriel (he can have me any day). But everyone else can die.I don\'t understand how you can make a fantastic, wonderful trilogy about love, friendship, healing, and everything beautiful in this world, and then come out with a disgusting, trashy, smutty ""romance"" that has absolutely no plot, shitty character growth,and an overall shitty book.Not to mention the cover. What is that, anyway??? An orange mask? A tiger?SJM took her perfectly developed characters and pretty much just let them rot. From the first three books, I loved every single person. Everyone. Now I hate Feyre. I hate Rhysand. I hate Cassian. I hate Amren. I hate Mor. For ** sake, IdespiseElain. Why is she a character? Why does sheexist? What does she add to the book? What role does she play, other than to collect people’s sympathy and make them feel sorry for her? I’m sorry (not), butElain is a ** idiot.I cannot STAND this hoe. Sarah, please write her death. I can\'t deal with her constant whining and bitching, running to Rhys and Cassian and telling them she wants to go back to the human world, just because of Nasty Nesta. Elain, you\'ve been living with your sister your entire life, and you choosenowto complain about how much of a bitch she is? Where were you the past eighteen years? Please, sweetie, grow a spine.I loved Feyre and Rhysso much(note *past tense*). I would\'ve done anything for them. Now I despise them with every atom in my body. The entire book is just themfucking, and Rhys bragging to Cassian that they’re fucking. And nowFeyre and Rhys have a childand now my life is over. I hated this book. I hated everything. No way I\'ve already mentioned that.On to the next bitch of the month: Cassian. Why the ** do I hate Cassian now (who I ADORED in ACOTAR)? For a simple question, there\'s an equally simple answer. Mostly because Cassian doesn\'t know how to keep his ((())) in his pants, and all he can think about is Nesta sUcKinG it and fUckInG it and doing whatever kinky shit they did that I can\'t even mention with a straight face. I hate you, Cassian. Ihateyou. Get me characters whose livesdon\'trevolve around their OTP and who think about thingsotherthan fucking, bucking and yucking the love of their life. Which—not to mention—Cassian and Nesta don\'t even seem to love each other. It\'s all about the rElEaSe for them, because apparently, these fictional bitches have so much sexual tension that they can\'t help rubbing up on each other every twenty ** pages. Bye. Every one of you nasty lil bitches disgust me.Wait, you\'restillnot done talking about the shitty characters? No bitch I\'m really not, because I\'m so angry at how many trees died for this pathetic book.The next shitty character I’ll be talking about is none other than Amren the hoe and Mor the bird. I honestly feel a little bad talking shit about them just because I adored them so much in the trilogy, but this shit has got to betalkedabout!Heads-up to all those authors out there: when you are describing a character and how pOwErFuL they are, please. please.pleasedo not get other powerful characters to ""shiver"" or ""pale"" when they are around the character you want to MAKE powerful. It is the cringiest thing I have ever read in my life. It’s so painful. Come up with some unique way to describe their power and make readers admire them, NOT get powerful characters like Amren to ""shiver"" and Rhys to ""pale"" when they are around Nesta. I don\'t necessarilyhateMor and Amren, but they’ve become so ** irrelevant in the fourth book that there\'s really no point talking about them anymore.Character ArcThe character growth in this book actually made me laugh. It was so minimal that it was astonishing. It was just Nesta apologizing to everyone because she realized everyone ** hated her guts and she had no one to go to. How can apologies possibly show character growth? I agree, Nesta\'s bitchy behavior throughout the book was inexcusable. However, that was why I liked her.It would\'ve been better if she continued being the bitchy little shit she was, but rushing her character growth towards the last 100 pages is stupid and inexcusable and straight up lazy, and it was a complete waste of my time.Love InterestNow let\'s get into why the ** I hate Rhysand\'s guts. Mind you, I used to love this hoe. I would’ve died for him. Now? I’m just glad I was never faced with that decision. If I was in Prythian, I would rather breathe raid smoke than the same air as him.First, Rhys is the only form of character growth in this entire book. I\'m sorry, did I say character growth? I meant characterdepletion. Rhysand has accomplished it, y\'all. He has accomplished his Unbecoming. Where was that sweet, kind, playful man that helped heal Feyre and helped her and everyone around him? Where the ** did he go, because I sure couldn\'t find him.Throughout the book he also brags to Cassian about fucking Feyre nonstop. You have sentences like:""\'Feyre initiated this round.\' Cassian could hear the pure male satisfaction in Rhys\' voice as he said it.""""I dismissed the maids bc I don\'t want them hearing what we\'re up to.""Cassian, laughing: ""Give the poor female a break""Rhysand: ""We\'re taking a break.For now."" (Did this bitch really just sayfor now?)But really though, why the FUCK is this necessary? Does Sarah J. Maas think it\'s attractive for a male to talk about his partner like that? What has she done to perfectly amazing characters? I am confusion? And disappointment? Now he is an egotistical jerk, a typical overprotective alpha male (*coughs* did someone say Rowan? - I despised him in EoS), and a ** shitty ass friend.I wouldn\'t go so far to say that ACOTAR was one of my favorite fantasy series ever, but it was definitely up there. Now, it is down there. I don\'t ever want to read about these thirsty whores ever again.PlotHold up, there was a ** plot? Unfortunately, there was nothing in this book resembling anything of the sort. There was no plot whatsoever, to the point that there weren\'t even any plot holes. In order to have plot holes, you must havesomesemblance of a plot. I was justwaitingfor some crazy SJM shit to go down, for her to pull some astonishing bullshit on us, for some hoe to declare war on another hoe. But then the book just ended. And I was confused. I didn\'t understand. I thought someone had ripped the last 200 pages from the back of my book. Alas, it was not my book\'s fault. It was the author\'s.Additional PointsI woke up at 9:38 AM to write this hateful review because the hate is overwhelming. I wanted to die reading this. Nesta is oh-so-powerful because her power is ""pure death,"" as Rhys puts it. I couldn\'t stand this. The only person that was tolerable in the slightest was Azriel, who I would probably marry. But everyone else in this book has turned shitty and disgusting. The other character who Isort oflike is Nesta, who everyone says is a selfish bitch, but that\'s really the only reason why I like(d) her.I was going to reread ACOMAF and the rest of that damn series before I started this book, but now I can\'t even bring myself to, because then I\'ll just end up remembering the utter failure that was ACOSF. I\'m not putting up with these characters anymore. Y\'all can all die and I would laugh. Which is certainly a surprise, since I balled my eyes out when I thought Rhys was dead in ACOWAR. Now Imyselfwould brandish the knife on him. I’d gladly throw him in that ** cauldron while cackling and sit there watching that bitch burn (that sounds really evil and i should delete this sentence but i won’t because i’m feeling resentful and bitter)Overall, i you\'re looking for a book with some steamy, smutty romance, then by all means, this might end up being your favorite book! But for those of us who have brains and who are sensible human beings and actually likecontentin a book, with likable characters, a plot driven story ... go home. Get your money back. Don\'t even get yourself hype for this book. I walked down that path, and honestly, there is no going back.And trust me, I know how popular SJM is. I can\'t scroll through the GR homepage without seeing some unsuspecting victim starting ACOSF. People probably won\'t stop talking about it for the next few months, which is unfortunate, because it\'s trash. I genuinely feel like this dumb shit is overshadowing some really top-tier books, so I\'m going to redirect y\'all to my favorite series of all time,An Ember in the Ashes. Read all four books, it\'ll do you some good, especially after shit like ACOSF fucks with your sanity. AEITA will put this trashy, slutty book to shameful tears.-1,000 starsCheck out my new blog'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '1 STAR.Nesta Acheron is the only interesting character that SJM has ever managed to write and yet she was treated like complete and utter shit throughout this whole book.THIS IS NOT A REVIEW OF THE STORY BUT INSTEAD A DISCUSSION OF SJM’S HORRIBLE “FEMINISM” AND HOW SHE DID NESTA ARCHERON DIRTY.SPOILERS BELOW.I knew before even starting this book that I would dislike the journey that SJM had obviously planned for Nesta but I elected to power through because I genuinely liked Nesta’s character and she resonated with me on a personal level. I shouldn’t have.Within the first few chapters of this book, I was already infuriated beyond belief. Not even 20 pages into the damned thing and we have Cassian, who is worried about thin and unhealthy Nesta has gotten when he suddenly goes off on a mental tangent about her “magnificent breasts”. What the fuck? Unfortunately for us all, this is not even the worst thing to happen to Nesta in the first chapter. We are immediately greeted with Nesta being furiously slut-shamed by her once-friend Amren and our captain feminist Rhysand agrees.“ “Though I bet it’s hard to look good,” Amren went on, “when you’re out until the darkest hours of the night, drinking yourself stupid and fucking anything that comes your way.” … Rhys seemed inclined to agree with Amren. “It seems Rhysand, who is famous for always LETTING women have a choice, does not agree when it comes to women he doesn’t like. Furthermore, Amren’s blatant slut-shaming is brushed off;“ - did Nesta notice the faint glimmer of worry in Amren’s smoky eyes-understand how rare it was? ”Who literally gives a shit. I don’t care if this is the first time Amren has ever been concerned for someone, you don’t say that type of shit to your supposed friend.Poor Nesta is then evicted from her home and ordered into doing what Feyre and Captain Feminist Rhysand want or she will be forced into the human world where she has no place and would be shunned. Some sister, huh? Not only this but Feyre and Rhysand take it upon themselves to tear down a whole block of APARTMENTS where PEOPLE LIVE just because they don’t like that Nesta stays there. SJM has not even tried to stop her privilege from seeping through her characters and if I didn’t already loathe Rhysand I would most definitely be leading the mob to his door at this point. And so Nesta is forced to obey Mr “You always have a choice” Rhysand and attend training with Cassian.We’ll skip a few chapters; Cassian whines and lusts and does a remarkable performance as a “Nice Guy” tm until Nesta insults his precious perfect High Lord and he tells that her everybody hates her. Everybody. Now, it’s remarkably obvious to even the characters in this god forsaken story that Nesta has been struggling after the war (after all it was the supposed reason they sent her away) and yet dear old Cassian gets upset that Nesta doesn’t like his bitch of a High Lord and tells her that everyone hates her. Everyone, you can assume, includes her sisters and himself. This gets resolved in typical SJM style with a “I didn’t mean it, I was angry” apology that is literally faker than me in my online lectures.We move on to some sort of conflict and Rhysand and Co. decide to “ask” Nesta to do something incredibly dangerous, the last time she had done it resulted in the capture of her younger sister Elain. Of course, Nesta doesn’t exactly want to do that and so our quirky inner circle quickly remind her that her aforementioned sister can do instead. The sister that Nesta would die to protect, that one? Yeah. And so, our lovely little Nesta is once more forced into doing what President Feminist wants because her only other option is to sacrifice her sister’s safety. But yeah, you always have a choice, right?Speaking of choices… time for the big one.It’s revealed to us that our darling couple Feysand are with child, cue cheers! Except, the baby has wings and giving birth to him will probably kill Feyre. Rhysand obviously goes around and makes everyone swear not to tell Feyre for… reasons? Captain Choice not telling his wife, mate whatever, that the child she’s carrying will pretty much kill her? Feminism.Now, this stays a secret for a while until Nesta finds out that the glamorous Inner Circle have been discussing her and taking votes on what is or isn’t essential for her to know about her own powers. So, Nesta’s pissed (as she very well should be) and has a confrontation that leads to her telling Feyre the truth about her little fae baby. Shock horror, Rhysand isn’t pleased. In fact, I believe his exact words were:“Get Nesta out of this city. Right now … Before I fucking kill her.”Charmer.Sure, Nesta only told Feyre the truth because she was angry and wanted to hurt her, but I hardly think Nesta is the villain in this situation. Yet she’s treated like one by everyone except Feyre (this is perhaps the only time Feyre has shown some sense). Not only that, Rhysand literally threatens to kill her. When I tell you, I had to put this book down because I was SO INFURIATED, I could barely breathe. If a man ever did that shit to me, he’d be dead in a ditch. But unsurprisingly, SJM pins the blame on Nesta.When I tell you, I could rant about SJM’s purported “feminism” for hours I am not lying. This review could go on for another 20 pages if I wanted to. However, spending that much energy on SJM would be a new low, even for me. So, a wrap-up.A Court of Silver Flames is potentially the worst book I have ever read, especially in terms of character development. We start with Nesta, traumatised and lashing out, and what do we finish with? A Nesta who had to go and beg for everyone’s forgiveness and nobody, not once, apologised to her despite everything I’ve just discussed. I think maybe Feyre apologised once and Rhysand buys her dresses at the end like … are you SHITTING me?!Throughout this story, Nesta finds her own little group of friends and this is probably the only good thing about this stupid fucking book. Nesta’s friendship with two other women was surprisingly heart-warming at times and perhaps the only thing SJM did not screw up completely.This book was a complete and utter fucking monstrosity and I sincerely hope SJM never writes another book again.Fuck you,Allana'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4.25 stars“So Nesta had become a wolf. Armed herself with invisible teeth and claws, and learned to strike faster, deeper, more lethally. Had relished it. But when the time came to put away the wolf, she\'d found it had devoured her too.”I am irrationally annoyed by how much I enjoyed this.I read the reviews and was prepared to snicker my way through the purring, the ridiculous sex scenes, and constant assertions of ""my mate."" However *sigh* this series just does something to my cold cynical heart. I laugh at it, but I am incapable of hating it.So take my hand, lovelies. Let us venture into my detailed thoughts, which I have thoughtfully assembled into a list with no discernible pattern or theme:-Nesta is so bitchy sometimes. I get that it\'s complex and there\'s a certain feminism in portraying someone like her as a protagonist instead of a villain, but jeez, girl. Learn some basic manners. I occasionally wonder if SJM went too far in making Nesta the selfish stepsister in ACOTAR. It\'s hard to shake off that image. She does attempt to justify it in this book by explaining that Nesta was angry at her father for giving up and not providing for his daughters. Nesta was ready to let them all starve to prove a point-Rhys says to Nesta, “Of course you have a choice. You always have a choice here,” like he didn’t force Nesta out of her flat, force her to live in one of his residences where she can\'t leave, force her to train with Cassian, force her to work at the library, etc. Surely there are better ways to stage an intervention. I know they did it out of love, but Tamlin did what he did out of love, too-Speaking of, everyone hates Tamlin because he gave Nesta and Elain to the King of Hybern (which he did to save Feyre), but when Rhys threatens to kill Nesta if she hurts Feyre, that’s somehow okay.Nesta literally had to flee for her life after telling Feyre the truth about her pregnancy-Rhys and Feyre are supposedly equals, but he refuses to tell Feyre about the dangers of her pregnancy. Nesta is portrayed as the bad guy for telling her sister the truth-Can we stop worshiping Rhys now? Please?-I like that Nesta asks Cassian how he likes his blowjob. It normalizes communication during sex-SJM is too lazy to think of actual names for magical places and items. Under The Mountain sounds ominous if you think about it, but then there’s the Harp, the Mask, and the Crown-Ireally liked Nesta\'s character arc: her struggle with trauma and depression, her cold rage at her father for refusing to provide for them and the steel pride that prevents her for apologizing to Feyre for her past behavior, the self-loathing and insecurity, the female solidarity with other victims of sexual assault and misogyny. On that last note, I\'ve never understood why Nesta and Elain were so upset with being being transformed into beautiful, powerful High Fae back during ACOWAR. SJM explains it more by linking the violent act of being forced inside the Cauldron and changed against her will with rape/sexual assault.-While I adore the themes mentioned above, SJM writes the same arc over and over. All of her female protagonists (Aelin, Feyre, that girl from House of Earth and Blood) wrestle with crippling depression at some point. She recycles plots and characters and writing phrases. Gets pretty old-The ending is thematically confusing.Nesta and her friends are thrown into the Illyrian Rite of Passage thing, which has traditionally forbidden female warriors because sexism. They get through it together without magic, symbolically smashing the patriarchy. This ties in with all the themes ACOSF has been pushing.Feyre\'s childbirth near the end is where it gets confusing. Both Feyre and her kid die, but Nesta saves them by stopping time and bargaining with Death (or the Cauldron, can\'t remember). She alters the shape of Feyre\'s pelvis so a kid with wings can pass through and transforms hers as well for her far-off future kid with Cassian. In exchange, Nesta gives up some of the power she took from the Cauldron, but gets to keep a little because God forbid a SJM character is anything less than overpowered.Thematically, the childbirth scene doesn\'t make sense in terms of the book\'s overall plot. What is the implication? That women have to sacrifice power in order to have kids? That doesn\'t fit the whole feminist angle.Maybe the scene can be interpreted as Nesta finally repairing her bond with Feyre? ASOSF has seen Nesta feeling disconnected from her family (guilt over her dead father, anger towards Elaine for supposedly turning her back on her, both rage and guilt regarding Feyre). Here, Nesta is restoring family by saving her sister and nephew\'s lives. She communes with the Mother, the harbringer of life. It contrasts her power of death, which is connected to her feelings of rage and desolation. Nesta believes she is too prickly to love, but through her hand (and better mental health), life blooms.That\'s a better interpretation than SJM had a baby in real life and wanted to work in motherhood somewhere. Also, Feyre has been resurrected twice now.

Rhys and Feyre are annoying to me because they are perfect and have no flaws and that's boring. I literally could not care less about any of the other characters besides Nesta, Cassian, and Azriel. SJM also uses repetitive language, and I swear she gets paid per ellipsis. There are many things I don't like about these books.But dang it, are they entertaining! And I would be lying if I didn't say that I shipped Cassian and Nesta like I never have anyone before!I was so ready for this ship to sail. And now that it has, I gotta say, I'm disappointed. I wantedmore. I can't even tell you what I wanted more of. I just wanted more of it. I think I hyped this up in my mind so much that there was no way it could ever live up to it. I wasn't consumed by the romance the way I wanted to be.I wanted an epic love story and I didn't get one.The whole romance felt 'meh' to me, which sucks since it's the main reason I read this book. I wanted the angst, the longing, the pining, the yearning! You romance readers know what I'm talking about. Instead, I got a lot of sex scenes. And while I don't mind it, I wanted more romance than sex. It didn't live up to my expectations.I also liked but didn't love the characters. I used to love Nesta, and while I liked her growth and seeing her overcome her trauma, she didn'tfeellike the Nesta I liked so much in ACOWAR. Maybe it's just my disappointment, but she and Cassian felt off to me. Just slightly out of character when compared to what I'd seen before. Then again, people are different from different perspectives.Having seen it all before from Feyre's POV means that we got a biased, not necessarily accurate representation of who they are.That brings me to the fact that I actually liked the Inner Circle more in this book than before. I still don't love them and think they're all lowkey horrible in their own way, but I was more ok with them. Maybe because unlike Feyre, who saw them as perfect people who could do no wrong, Nesta isn't afraid to point out their flaws. Unfortunately, Cassian is blind to the fact that Rhys has flaws at all. It bothered me so much how angry and borderline violent he'd become whenever Nesta mentioned she didn't like Rhys. I also hated how Cassian was so unbothered when Rhys threatened to kill his mate. I kept waiting for Cass to stand up for Nesta in front of Rhys. It didn't happen. I don't know why everyone in this series insists on acting like Rhys is the greatest thing since sliced bread.All of that said,I did enjoy watching Nesta come into her own, and find happiness with her new friends.\xa0I also loved Nesta's relationship with the House.\xa0The House and Nesta is a friendship I didn't know I needed. By far the best relationship in the book.!!!THE FOLLOWING IS A SPOILER!!!I hate that Nesta had to lose her power. She was death incarnate and could wield insanely powerful objects as no one else could. Then it was taken away. It's like SJM didn't want her to be a match to the ever-perfect and powerful Rhys. Same with Amren in ACOWAR. Why can't powerful women stay powerful? Also, while I'm all for girl power, Nesta and her friends shouldn't have won the Blood Rite. How do girls who have been training for three months win against warriors that have been training for years? It makes no sense.!!!SPOILER OVER!!!Also, this had a weak plot.All of the books in this series do if I'm honest. It's definitely a character-focused novel. The plot feels distant from the story. It's worse because the plot of this is very obviously a setup to other novels. The villain in this story was irrelevant, they didn't even make an appearance until the end.It feels like the introductory book in a series,which I suppose it is, but I still didn't like it. This made the book feel longer than it was, and it was already pretty gosh darn long (not that it stopped me from reading it in one go).Overall, this book was OK. Nothing more. Nothing less. I am still eagerly awaiting Azriel's book.Also!! Apparently, Feyre doesn't suck at painting! Shocking right! This is the first time that her paintings were described in detail and people actually commented on their beauty rather than just vaguely acknowledging them. In my mind she still sucks though.Ok, now I'm about to get controversial. Don't come for me, I don't have the energy for it.Apparently, all the SJM haters have been bullying people for buying this book because it's not diverse enough? WTF.If you don't want to read this book, don't. If you don't want to buy this book, don't. If you're mad because the author is writing the story she wants with the characters she wants, go read other books. It's truly that simple.Don't bully people for spending their money how they want and for reading what they want.\xa0As far as I know, Sarah J. Maas hasn't disrespected anyone in her books. Sure, her books are hella white. But if it bothers you, go read more diverse books. Don't be an asshole to people who want to read this. And don't be a hypocrite and tell people that you don't support the story but then say you're gonna pirate it because you're still interested in reading it.Read it or don't.

Armed herself with invisible teeth and claws, and learned to strike faster, deeper, more lethally. Had relished it. But when the time came to put away the wolf, she\'d found it had devoured her, too.""Just out of respect for this book, I feel like I should be going through a mourning phase, sit with this story a little while longer and let it simmer, rather than trying to move on. I can\'t even begin to tell you how much of a therapeutic reading experience this was.It had all the SJM trademarks, great friendships, great emphasis on found families, great character development, and even greater sex. Of course.I\'d call this Part 2 toA Court of Mist and Fury. It echoes that book very much in terms of the themes discussed, i.e. depression and going through the process of healing from trauma, which she very much highlights is never linear.With Nesta that depression took on a different, more aggressive form:•\tNesta is a stone-cold bitch. I relate.•\tHer anger was fierce. I relate.•\tShe pushed people away with her attitude. On purpose. I relate.•\tLack of self-worth. I relate.•\tExtreme discomfort to emotions so anger is the easiest option. I relate.Do we see a pattern developing here?”Did she count–was she worth being counted? It was the question that sent everything crumpling inside her.”She had every right to be one (anyone that has carried this much anger and depression on their shoulders knows how much this weighs you down and debilitates you), though I initially hated how her anger would attack anyone that remotely showed any care. But your circumstances shape you. Trauma leaves an imprint. Hurt people hurt people. She was trapped in a vicious cycle of self-loathing and hatred and grief and it took a tremendous toll on her mental well-being. All due to her dysfunctional childhood, her body being invaded without permission and being thrust into a world she was conditioned to hate.I could write essays on Nesta’s character. I adore what Sarah J Maas did with this. There was so much attention to detail when it came to Nesta’s overall well-being, all which attributed to her growth and healing and it blew me away. It became about the little things, celebrating the small growths, embracing setbacks and moving forward in your own way and your own time.This is very much a character driven book, which is probably why I loved it so much. I’ll take that over plot any day, especially when it’s done well. However, there is a plot present. The world-building become even more epic in this book. It was so much more solid, since it was built upon from the other books in the series. I mean, that House? I want one!I didn’t want this book to end – it could’ve been longer. This almost felt like an extensive prologue. We just got to see the cusp of her capabilities asNestaand I’m craving more of her.

I WANT TO DEDICATE MY TIME TO RANDOM ACTS OF KINDNESS TO MY WONDERFUL REAL FRIENDS ON HERE AND IN LIFE. NOT WASTE TIME ON BOOK DRAMA!! (Funny how no one skimmed the smut they bitch about) 😉🤣😂😏My thoughts are wayyyy down below. And if anyone doesn’t like what I say or the book that I love so much or the author just go eff off! I don’t give a rats ass what you think. I’ve already deleted and blocked a person I didn’t particularly like their comment on my review so...😘This is a whole damn mood for me!!!!!!!!!!!!!When I read fantasy books I try to remember to put on my favorite YouTube music. It just sets the mood!https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6nRFaOF...In the beginningAnd in the endThere was DarknessAnd nothing more***I have this image coming from my UK woman on a booksleeve! 😏Nesta didn’t, couldn\'t, move as Cassian leaned in to whisper in her ear, ""The first time I saw that look on your face, you were still human. Still human, and I nearly went to my knees before you."" His breath caressed the shell of her ear and she couldn’t stop her eyes from fluttering shut. His smile brushed against her temple. ""Your power is a song, and one I’ve waited a very, very long time to hear, Nesta.""I didn’t have a clue how much I would love this damn book! It’s my favorite out of all of the series so far.I’ve been deeply hurt mentally and physically in my life. I used to be in a fighting school until my physical/medical shit has mostly taken things away from me. I have a couple real life girl friends, but nothing like this book, oh how I wish!! So, this book hit all of the feels for me!Nesta is an asshole, but she has some reasons with mental trauma - I can relate - I’ve got a lot of mental issues myself but not for the same reasons.I loved the fighting and strengthening scenes, I so much loved this in my life and miss it tremendously. I love the girl friends made and the girl empowerment in the book. These women went through hell!!I love Cassian so much. I love Nesta! I love all of the family and I love that damn house! Oh if I could have a house like that!!I love some of the things Sarah said in the acknowledgments.This book made me cry tears of sadness and happiness!The strength these women showed through the help of Nesta and Cas and Az were amazing. But ultimately they did it themselves. I love finding characters that are like this as I can try my hardest to be the same way. Among the many things I deal with I fight wanting to kill myself. It’s been really bad lately and I’m working with my doctors and my nature. These characters made me so happy, which I don’t have a lot of happiness and I’m so grateful. There’s only so much a person can hide about themselves trying to act all happy on the other side of the internet.Anyway, I loved this book dearly.And if it didn’t have enough action for you or was too smutty or written without certain characters and bullshit you wanted, f*ck off and write your own damn book and quit your damn bitching. I’m just sayin, I haven’t read any shit reviews and I won’t. I’m keeping to my own happiness of the book.Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾'}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""100 days into 2021 and 100 books have been read.

Hopes and prayers are answered!!!!""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'No one is a bigger Nessian stan than me...so imagine my surprise at this rating.This reviewWILL CONTAIN MAJOR SPOILERSso please read at your own risk if you haven\'t finished or picked up the book. But to adequately rant (like, truly rant) about all the ways this book didn\'t work for me we just need to air it all out without an vague mentions of what went down in this book.My biggest problem with this book started and ended with Rhys and Feyre. Y\'all, I truly doNOTcare about them anymore. They had their time to shine and they did...so can we please move on? The second I read about Rhys having his shield up around Feyre so no one could detect her scent I was 1000% sure she was pregnant and pissed the fuck off because I knew somehow this was going to circle all the way back around them. And sure enough Rhys went off to be an absolute piece of garbage and not tell Feyre that she would die delivering their child since it had wings. So, when NestaFINALLYhas her big moment to show how much she\'s grown as a character it\'s overshadowed by Feyre going into labor and almost dying. Which pissed me off in itself, however, I made it 730 pages and nearly put this book down because of how triggering it was. A warning would have been nice instead of having to read about a lifeless child being born because some of us have actually been dealt that shitty card in life and would rather not have to relive those moments. I was truly ready to vomit and ended up having to skim those pages.Next up, and almost just as disappointing was the romance between Nesta and Cassian. I have loved them since day one and was so looking forward to watch their love story unravel. On one hand, I loved the physical aspect of it. SJM upped her smut game for sure in this one but that\'s pretty much where it ended. There was something major missing between the two of them that left me feeling next to nothing for them and all the tension between the two of them in the prior books was so far out the window. Truly a letdown and please don\'t even get me started on how abysmally underwhelming the ""mate"" reveal was.Third, was Nesta\'s growth. Just like I loved Nesta and Cassian together, I loved Nesta by herself. She\'s always been one of my favorite characters in this series even when she was a shitty person. So, I was always looking forward to the day when we would get Nesta\'s story because she needed a major glow up growth wise and usually SJM is really great at writing good, solid growth in her characters. But again, this fell so short that majority of it just seemed physical instead of mental. While I\'m aware she has a lot of growing to do and this book was essentially her realizing that it leads me to wonder...did we really need 750 pages just to get to that point? I think not.The only, and when I say only I really mean it, thing I thoroughly enjoyed in this story was the ""Valkyrie"" training and the friendship that Nesta, Emerie, and Gywn had. I was flying through the part were the girls were thrown into the Blood Rite and cheering them on to make it all the way to the top of Ramiel. But that\'s basically it...and to get that little enjoyment in 750 pages is just a total fail for me.Of course, even though this book totally didn\'t cut it for me and left me beyond furious (Rhys & Feyre, I\'m looking at you) I\'m still a clown and will buy the next book when it comes out because I need to see what in the hell SJM is doing with these characters. Specifically Mor..why was she nonexistent this entire book? And Azriel... are him and Elain mates or not? Because I will riot if they are, he deserves so much more than miss garden girl.Okay, rant over 🙃'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""All the Stars ⭐️✨⭐️✨⭐️I know a lot of people don't like her...but Nesta is my favorite ACoTAR character, and has been since the end of book one/beginning book two.I love female characters who are unashamedly prickly...who have defensive outer shells and soft inner cores...who secretlycarethat people don't like them...but also simultaneously don't give a shit.Ever since Maas has been dangling the Nesta/Cassian pairing in front of us like so much chocolate, I have been dying for the focus to be on them.

It’s so unfair to the other books :((Quick Warning:Have an aspirin handy because what goes down in this book will mess with your heart.Reading this book felt like having a cold breeze brush my face after being out in the hot sun; of honey-ginger tea making its way down my sore throat. It gave me an adrenaline rush I don't think even confronting a Polar Bear would've given me.This book was definitely flawed and I wasn’t a huge fan of the plot (if there was one). Nesta and Cassian’s relationship however was like a weightless joy. Every conversation, every emotion had so much depth and every character grew in their own roundabout way.This book highlights the ramifications of the War with Hybern- Nesta's trauma and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. After losing her mother at a very young age, having to watch her father's neck being snapped right after he told her how much he loved her, being turned into a High Fae against her will, and the pain of almost losing her sister Elaine, broke something in her. Everybody has their own way of dealing with trauma. Nesta deals with it by building an invisible wall around herself and pushing away the people that love her the most by hurting them with her acid words.As she embarks on a journey towards self-development, she finds that the only one who can decimate the wall around her isCassian- A fierce Illyrian warrior and the General Commander of the Night Court.As her wall keeps degenerating over time, a deliciously romantic and sex-drenched relationship develops between them. There's obviously LOTS of steamy, ragingly passionate scenes but what is most appealing in their relationship is the minor displays of affection and the respect they have for each other and will set your soul on fire.They each challenge the status quo and reveal themselves to be stronger than anyone imagined through rigorous training and practice.I love howSarah J Maasredeemed Nesta's character in tiny steps and not like how she redeemed Rhysand in ACoMaF. Nesta's journey toward self-love wasn't smooth. She kept falling down, picking herself back up only to realize she fell deeper. This falling-down-climbing-back-up-thing went on for a while and it was so raw and real that my tear glands vowed to empty every drop from my body.For all those who hate Nesta after reading ACoFaS, let me tell you: I come from the same place. But do not let that stop you from reading this book because what's the worse that can happen, hmm? You will either hate it in which case you can always DNF it or get back to it later. But if you love it, then there's no stopping you from jumping around like a maniac. But if you don't even try, you will never know, will you?""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""“Forgiveness is not that easy.”“Forgiveness is something we also grant ourselves.”So did I really wait three years for ACOSF only to binge read it in 14 hours with 0 sleep? Yeah I did and it wasso worth it.And before you start looking for it in this review, yes we find out what was in the box and yes we find out if they are mates or not but no I will NOT spoil those in this review. I also included links to the bonus scenes at the bottom.SPOILERS BELOWSo I’m just gonna go ahead and say SJM fed us so good after almost three years! So many theories were proven and the filler chapters were giving me life. It’s perfect for those who’ve followed her series as they come out and have had to endure the torturous wait for more.But first thing’s first:what thehellhappened to the conflict that was building up in ACOFAS?I can’t have been the only one bamboozled with the way Sarah conveniently just resolved The One Big Thing that could have been the center of ACOSF. You should’ve seen my face when Cassian mentioned that Kallon DIED IN THE PREVIOUS RITE without a fuss. Like? What? Isn’t…that… why… we’re here…. ? No? Okay?And alsowhat happened to the “You’re coming with me to the Illyrian Mountains” bit?Again, another misdirection (for lack of a better word) on what we were expecting ACOSF to be. Soooo many people, me included, were expecting Nesta to move in with Cassian in a small cottage to actually live in the Windhaven Camp! I’m actually pretty sad that that didn’t come to pass BUT I’m not complaining with how things turned out.WITH THAT SAID;1. Put simply, the wait was worth it.I loved this book.I loved the plot.I loved NessianI loved the smut!!!!!!I loved the House of Wind.I loved Eris.I loved MOR (I know I’m surprised at how that turned out too).I loved Azriel-the-chaperone!“You two need a chaperone up here?”Yes. No. Yes. “I thought you were the chaperone.”Az threw him a wicked smile. “I’m not entirely sure I’m enough.”The full quote is even better than I could have hoped for!2. Another thing I love about ACOSF was the passage of time!The entire book spans about a little over a year, which justifies the crazy amount of events that happen in this behemoth of a book.Remember when the entire TOG series was said to have happened in onlyone year? Yeah I didn’t like that.3. I have a feeling that the red star that shot through the sky was Aelin falling through Prythian in KOA!PLEASE TELL ME YOU GUYS SAW IT TOO.“The mood hadn’t been helped by a rare red star blasting across the sky one day—an ill omen, Nesta had heard the priestesses muttering. Cassian reported that even Rhys had been rattled by it, seeming unusually contemplative afterward. But Nesta suspected that the omen wasn’t the only thing contributing to Rhys’s solemnity. Feyre was only two months from giving birth, and they still knew nothing about how to save her.”4. I’m just gonna take a minute here to talk about the smut.So ACOSF is officially an adult book and it shows in the smut! There is so much of it and I have only one complaint - that SJM did not flesh out a particular 34+35 scene. She no longer uses her oh-so-famous “velvet wrapped steel” innuendos. We go straight to the point with “cock” and even the word “cunt” now.It also goes without saying that the smut is decidedly more intense than what we've seen from her previous books. SJM was not kidding at all when she said she's descended into new levels of filthy when writing ACOSF.I did, however, still have some slight issues with the bookFor one, I didnotlove how Feysand hijacked certain parts of this book *cough cough the ending cough cough* It’s a Nessian book and yet Feysand is still the center of their world. No, I’m living in Nesta’s world. I want it to be all about her!I also had a slight disconnect with Nesta’s character although I can’t tell if she was acting out of character or if she was just grossly misrepresented in books 1-3 since we read it from Feyre’s POV. Nevertheless, I still love how she arced as a character and how she healed.START MAJOR SPOILERS SECTIONEnding spoilerI’m very sad that Nesta pulled an Aelin and lost majority of her powers in the end. I loved powerful!Nesta. I loved that everyone was afraid of her. I loved that she was rewriting Prythian history by merely existing. Gods that are older than Prythian itself were afraid of her. I hate how she gave that up in the end. What is it with women being rendered powerless in these books (Aelin and Amren)?Nesta spoilerI am also upset that Nesta ended up melding back with the IC? Everyone was expecting her to move out to Illyria and have her own family outside of the Night Court - I wanted that for her too. But, oh well.Azriel POV spoiler (Bonus scenehttps://drive.google.com/drive/folder...)I’m SO excited to see where his story goes. I’m not a heavy shipper for Elriel or Moriel or Azgwyn (??) but I’m interested to see who gets to be with Azriel in the end!Feysand POV spoiler (Bonus scenehttps://www.reddit.com/r/acotar/comme...ORhttps://wetransfer.com/downloads/abec...)THAT TEASER OF RHYSAND’S LAST NAME??? GIVE IT TO US SARAH WE ARE SO CLOSE.Generic spoiler…..And is anyone else scared that not even one minor character died… That’s kinda sus….END MAJOR SPOILERS SECTIONAll in all, I would give this 4.8 stars because it was just so good, save for the extremely high expectations which were kinda curbed with her sudden plot change.The Azriel bonus scene was also super interesting and I’m excited to see what book 5 has in store for us!So I'm gonna go and digest this for a few days before rereading it all over againbecause I am a slut for Nessian.———PRE ACOSF RELEASE PREDICTIONS BELOWBecause Feb 2021 is coming nearer, I'm going to post my expectations for ACOSF because I'm a simp for Nessian.These will be a mix of stories from ACOTAR 1-3 I want told from their POVs as well as their own character arcs!FOR CASSIAN> More about his upbringing and his mother> Him wrecking oneBUILDINGin the Summer Court that resulted in him being banned lol> His first encounter with Bryaxis> Cassian taking Mor’s v*rginity> What the hell was in that box he threw into the Sidra 😭😭😭😭> Training the female Illyrians and Nesta> Seeing him more as a General Commander and not the class clown/comic relief in the IC that we saw him from Feyre’s POV. I need to see Warrior!CassianFOR NESTA> Learning more about her bond with her mother> Exploring her powers and what she is> Her initial days in Velaris after being Made> Acknowledging her destructive habits and learning to heal> I want to see Amren vs Nesta OR Mor vs Nesta and have Nesta KICK THEIR ASSES> Nesta and Emerie bonding>NESTA IN ILLYRIAN LEATHERS AND WALLOPING CASSIAN IN THE RING> Nesta taking the Rite!!!!> Kicking some Illyrian butts who try to make her feel inferior> Finding her own Inner Circle because I’ll be damned if she works for Rhys> Speaking of Rhys, I wanna see Nesta make him cry (I love Rhys but we all know he and Nesta hate each other lol)> Have her let go of Elain and finally be her own person with her own life that isn’t all about protecting her younger sisterThese are just off the top of my head but obvs there are more angsty Nessian scenes that Ineeeeeedto happen or else I will die""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""1.)A Court of Thorns and Roses★★★★2.)A Court of Mist and Fury★★★3.)A Court of Wings and Ruin★★★3.1)A Court of Frost and Starlight★★★[2024 reread]★★★★i feel like this book is very polarizing among readers, but i think i land on the unpopular side with believing this book is maybe sjm’s best. this is truly close to a five stars for me, and i think i was able to appreciate even more rereading it.in this first book of the acotar spin-offs, we see nesta and cassian, both doing immense healing and growing. this book does star nesta, and truly seeing her reclaim her life, her safety, her agency… it was so beautiful. the very basic premise of this book is that nesta and cassian are tasked with tracking down three magical items, one of which one of the human queens may be using. we get to see nesta learn her own powers, we get to see her train with cassian, we get to see her love - both herself and new friendships… and yes, cassian - and we get to see her heal the way she needs to heal. it was honestly very powerful and, again, i really do not think sarah gets the credit for this book that she deserves.oh, and there is a romance novel loving sentient house who stole my heart all over again. sometimes, all you really need is a friend who knows how to keep you warm in the way you need to be kept warm. i just loved this with my whole heart, friends.i have now finished my reread of what is out in the acotar series and… i had such a good time rereading all of these. I think my biggest takeaway is… i didn’t love rhysand (this feels wild to even type). i feel like he was truly book boyfriend status back in the day, but now? i feel like he made me upset way more than he ever made me swoon during this reread. And this book really solidified that, and i think it was extra amplified because cassian is such a good boy. but again, this was such a fun reread that i really enjoyed doing, and we will see if i can rereadthrone of glassvery soon!trigger + content warnings(with minor spoilers for this story!):ptsd, grief, loss of loved ones in past (parents, siblings), blood, domestic abuse in past, child abuse in past, sexual assault in past, talk of rape in past, murder, death, talk of war, sexism, misogyny, nightmares, talk of captivity in past, drowning, attempted assault and rape, talk of suicide ideation, withholding very important medical information, high-risk pregnancy, ableist and dated language for people with disabilities, emergency child birth scene (involving death of both mother and baby… this world has the power of magic so things end up okay, but i think this could be very triggering to some readers, so please use caution.)[2021 first read]★★★★listen, i can't believe we are here either. but this just truly impacted me (and made me cry) so much. i will say I feel a little biased because nesta and cassian are two of my favorite characters from this entire series but... i still didn't expect this to be so beautiful. and nesta finding these friendships and seeing them heal together, see their worth together, love unconditionally and unapologetically together? regardless of how hard and scary the journey to those steps were to even get to? seeing nesta realize she's not a bad person, no matter what the world makes her mental health believe? i really loved it.blog|instagram|youtube|kofi|spotify|amazon""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'This book made a lot of choices. Most of them were bad.A Court of Silver Flamesfeels like poorly written ACOTAR fanfiction. It has all the tags and features: making you hate the canon main characters, an uncomfortable pregnancy, the incorporation of lore you didn’t ask for and don’t need, ridiculously toxic love interests, and an unnecessary 200,000 word count.Let’s talk about the High Lord of the Night Court, a character who was a villain, then an adored main character, and now a villain again. Rhysand is so violent and overprotective and his only personality trait is “I will shred you to bits if you touch or breathe on or think about Feyre.” He literally put a shield around her so even her friends couldn’t be around her. Rhysand is only respectful to women who are submissive to him and obey his authority. He was nice to Nesta only after she made a huge sacrifice at the end for his sake. He’s so bitter, and I don’t know why Feyre finds that attractive. I liked him before because he wasn’t overprotective. He let Feyre do what she wanted. But now…“Cassian knew [Rhysand would] shred anyone who so much as blinked wrong at Feyre into a million bloody ribbons.”lol.Feyre is just a decoration in this book. Although she does have power, we don’t see her use it like she did in the previous books. What happened to that important and empowering fight to make her High Lady? Now she has no agency.I’m especially angry because this is so out of character for the Inner Circle. Mor’s development horrified me in particular. She was abused badly in the Court of Nightmares, so she knows how terrible and sick they are. Azriel even describes the way she “savored every moment in the sun… as if the first seventeen years of her life, spent in the darkness of the Hewn City, still lurked around her.” But then Mor says this:Mor sipped her tea, the portrait of elegant innocence. “We’d be better off throwing Nesta into the Court of Nightmares. She’d thrive there.”What happened to the Inner Circle who accepted Feyre with open arms and helped her heal from her sorrow and trauma? Is Feyre’s grief more palatable to the Inner Circle than Nesta’s? The sisters process their hurt in different ways, but Rhysand acts like Nesta is an embarrassment to the family because of it, like they would be the perfect family if it weren’t for her. In contrast, Feyre gets all the support she needs. There are ways to build up new protagonists without turning the ones we already love into villains.I haven’t even talked about the worst part of the book yet: Feyre’s situation. (I think this was revealed pretty early in the book, so it isn’t a spoiler. But you can fast forward to the next paragraph if you don’t want to know.) Feyre is in the middle of a life-threatening pregnancy with a baby that could literally rip her apart. Guess who decides by committee that it would be better not to tell her this vital information about her pregnancy, her health, her life, and the baby inside her body. That’s right: Rhysand and the Inner Circle. A really important theme of ACOTAR is individual, personal freedom. But this threw that all away. I cannot describe how infuriated this made me. And when Nesta made the decision to tell Feyre that childbirth would kill her (a decision made out of spite, but still a good one for Feyre), the response from the other characters was bizarre. From what I remember, Feyre was upset but ultimately supported the Inner Circle’s decision to hide this from her, and Nesta was forcibly and emphatically rejected by her family. I can’t make this stuff up.Parts ofA Court of Silver Flameswere good, although they were few and far between. The Blood Rite was pretty cool. The tension and high stakes and character development and the way the Valkyries bonded in their struggle was amazing. I really liked Emerie and Gwyn, and I’m invested in their backgrounds and their journeys to come. They are refreshingly unproblematic and normal. They are easy characters to love.Besides the ending, the plot wasn’t very good. The search for the Crown/Harp/Mask felt arbitrary and too random for my taste. It also got sidetracked constantly, so it wasn’t satisfying to me. However, this gripe seems so minor compared to the rest of the dumpster fire that isA Court of Silver Flamesthat I don’t even care.“My mate” every other pageHas filled me with unending rageBreaking Dawn-esque pregnancyFeels like a fanfic fever dreamAzriel, he shadow-singsCas doesn’t have the longest wingsFeyre does interior designNesta walks a narrow lineGwyn and Emerie are true heroesCassian’s over five zero zeroSister’s sick?

I got so much to say, so jumping right in.Why I rated it 1 star when I read it the first time-1. I read the whole series in one go instead of pacing myself or giving a break in between the ACOTAR world. Reading it immediately after ACOWAR and ACOFAS backfired. It led me to bebored.2. I thought it wastoo smutty.Which it still is fyi but this did not concern me in my reread oddly.3. I hadnot liked Nesta.Jumping straight from Feyre's journey was not an ideal decision. Feyre had a trilogy, so spending a lot of time with her compared to just one book of Nesta's did make an impact. I was still angry with Nesta and her treatment of Feyre.4. I simplyforgot about the majority of eventsthat were correlated to the Crescent City series when I made my GR account and rated it.Why I give it 5 stars now-1. Ipaced myself.Gave myself some time in between ACOWAR, AOCFAS and ACOSF. This worked brilliantly for me. There was proper balance.2. Idid not expect muchas I was concerned about how this reread will go. With my expectations low, the reread ended surprising me.3.I ADORED Nestathis time around. I found her journey admirable, relatable and far more understandable. Her struggles were portrayed in such a raw manner and the way she overcame them bit by bit was chef's kiss. I too, like the other characters had not given her a fair chance but when I did the way she blossomed into a wonderful character was worth rereading!! Nesta is such a badass and although I am not saying she was not wrong before (she was) but I understand now.I see Nesta Archeron, her being, and she is worthy.4.Romance and banterwas so fun. Cassian is such a softie and marshmallow at heart. I swear I just wanna give him a big bear hug.5. I loved reading about thepossibilities of different worlds connecting.There's so much that can happen.6. Theendingwas so emotional. I swear I was sobbing.Some things that might be controversial but I wanna state my take on it-1. I see people call Rhysand an arrogant asshole a lot in reference to his persona in this book.I disagree.Sure, he was harsh a bit but never arrogant, never an asshole. Rhys was always honest, never lying to anyone or Nesta. He has his mate to look after, his court to look after. People think that just cause he is Feyre's mate that's all there is to him. Wrong! Rhys is also High Lord. Trained to be a leader and warrior, he talks and acts like one. He doesn't have to act soft towards others he doesn't know well. And Nesta was that one person, he did not know.Just cause someone criticizes you, does not mean they are your enemy.The amount of hate Rhys gets is just uncalled for imo.2. This might not be so controversial butNesta's powers???The thing that happened at the end should not have happened. That's all I'll say to keep it spoiler free lol.Without elaborating much on my private life, I just wanna say- I felt Nesta's journey deeply and it resonated with me. There have been some changes in my own life since the last time I read this book and all I say to Nesta is, I get it.Man, I just had a completely new experience reading this lmao. Am sitting here as I draft my review, thinking wtf did I read the first time😂🙈~•~•~It's time to give Nesta another chance.

How strongly and personally it touched me.This is not an easy book to read and understand.I guess that part of its rawness and bittersweet tones are to blame on the fact that it's told from Nesta's pov, a character who was firstly written to be hated and who probably hates herself more than the audience ever could and eventually did.She's a very intense fictional person, and I'd lie if I said she didn't frustrate me to no end in more than one occasion.But I guess that's exactly what SJM wanted from this character.I could literally feel the self-hatred exude from the pages. The self-sabotaging, the way Nesta, who's never been a saint but who maybe was programmed to feel like she was one, denies herself everything that makes her feel even remotely worthy of light.I know how that feels, and I wanted to see what she would do to use her pain, her trauma and her past to mold herself into a new, damaged yet not spoilt, perpetually-evolving creature.I wasn't disappointed.I actually got more than I expected, because I eventually ended up falling in love with all the nuances this character possesses.Not one of them had offered to help save the Archeron family from poverty.They had thrown them all, mere children and a crumbling man, to the wolves.So Nesta had become a wolf. Armed herself with invisible teeth and claws, and learned to strike faster, deeper, more lethally. Had relished it. But when the time came to put away the wolf, she’d found it had devoured her, too.I must admit I never really was a fan of Nesta, but I didn't really ever hate her, either. I was simply indifferent to her and her antics, especially considering I knew being ACOTAR a Beauty and the Beast retelling, at least one of the sisters must be an asshole, and that's Nesta for you.I started getting interested in her as a character at the start of ACOWAR and, confession time, I mainly did it because of a pretty awesome Nessian fanart I've seen on instagram.Oh, don't judge me.The point is, as weak as I am for a good and steamy romance, it takes more than fantart and a few stolen glances to make me appreciate a difficult character, and if SJM managed to steal my heart with her Nesta, in the end, it means she did a great job that goes way beyond ships and smut.For the majority of the previous novels, Nesta is an unlikeable character, and for obvious reasons, the author doesn't want you to like her, so that it feels even more genuine when you start seeing there's good in her, and that she's perfectly nuanced, just like a real person.“There can be nothing more than sex, Cassian.”His jaw tightened, and he seemed to struggle with some internal battle before he said darkly, “Then I’ll take whatever you offer me.” He leaned in, his body still not touching hers, and said against her ear, “And I’ll take you however you wish me to.”Her toes curled on the stones, her hair dripping. “And if I wish to take you?”He smiled against her ear. “Then I’ll beg you to ride me into oblivion.”I want to discuss her character's journey in this review, because the book itself was good and the plot -the amount that was there, at least- was okay, but A Court of Silver Flames is a charcater-driven novel where the protagonist wasn't always a good person.For example, I've read at least a dozen reviews complaining about how this book makes you love Nesta and hate the rest of the original characters, or the opposite, and I can't say I don't see wher they come from, but I was lucky enough to fall in neither of these two categories since I've ended up loving Nesta and loving the other characters, as well, at the same time.They didn't always treat her with kindness, but I feel like they treated her in a very realistic way.When someone keeps pushing their luck, it's only a matter of time before people lose their patience.I loved how they each had a chance to connect and tangle their story with Nesta's, getting to know her, getting loved and understood by her, all of them finally getting a second chance at redemption and healing.One of the scenes I loved the most, is in fact, towards the end when Rhys kneels in front of Nesta after she's saved both Feyre and her baby's life. I lost it completely when they hugged.Nesta isn't an easy person to get along with. She's got a past that pretty much justifies her actions, but the way she choses to handle the consequences is all her own. And that's the point I feel like we need to remember. All her flaws are on display right from the start and there are moments when it even gets worse, but it's all part of her journey.It's only when you reach rock bottom that you can do anything but go up, right?“You could have ruled the world with your power,” he said carefully.“I don’t want to rule the world.” Her eyes were unguarded in a way he had never seen. Mate, she had called him.“What do you want?” Cassian managed to ask, voice rasping.She smiled, and damn if it wasn’t the loveliest thing he’d ever seen. “You.”“You’ve had me from the moment you met me.”She tucked a strand of hair behind an arched ear. “I know.”I loved how Nesta's relationship with Elain and Feyre was addressed. Elain could never do anything wrong in Nesta's eyes and the moment she (presumably) turned her back on her, Nesta was forcefully faced with a truth she wasn't ready to see, or better, that she didn't want to see.Same thing with Feyre. I felt like the sybolism of Feyre hanging paintings of everyone but Nesta in the new, opulent house she and her husband created, was for Nesta worse than any offense the inner circle ever thrown her way (and not without merit).One of the things Nesta resented most about about Feyre, in fact, is the fact that Nesta needed her to survive but Feyre didn't need her in return. Feyre was nothing but kind to her, all the time, but she hit her in the most subtle of ways, in a way that is more important to Feyre than words.Mind it, I don't mean what Nesta did and how she acted in the past is condonable, I'm just saying there's a reason behind her actions, reasons that will definitely help you (I don't say like, because you're allowed to still not like a character even if their past is justified) understand her a bit more.Nesta, as I see her, didn't like the hate and anger she felt all the time, especially towards her little sister. She, in fact, hated it and hated herself for feeling it.I've seen reviewers claim Nesta's friendship with Gwyn and Emerie made no sense, since she already had two sisters she could connect and make up with; I see their point, but I feel like Nesta was re-discovering herself and creating bonds tentatively presenting herself as the new person she was trying to become.Her relationship with the House, for example, was my absolute favorite. In my opinion, the fact that the House was stubborn, sweet, sarcastic in its own special way, warm and curious, added to the knowledge that Nesta Made it, makes me wonder (and hope) if that's exactly how Nesta sees her true self, if that's what she'd like others to see her.Rhys lifted his head. “This is a bad idea.”Cassian winked. “That should be written on the Night Court crest.”I loved seeing her through the eyes of someone who didn't fully know the darkest sides of her trauma and grief; I feel like it gave Nesta a glimps of what her life with her sisters could have been had her mother not gaslighted her into needing to be perfect at all costs, filling her head with conjectures and prejudices and depriving her from being free to decide what to do with her personality and future.And that's where Cassian finally jumps in. God bless that guy, honestly.I absolutely LOVED how he wasn't afraid to call her out on her bullshit but still knew (my god, he justknew) she needed some love despite it all, simple as that, and without asking anything in return.And sure, both Feyre and Elain loved Nesta, but I feel like the relationship the three sisters always had was always taunted by what they had to endure for and with one another.Feyre and Rhys will always own my heart, but Cassian and Nesta gave me the best emotions and I will never forget how beautiful they are together.And, holy shitNesta at the end, deciding she one day will want to have a baby with her Cassian completely destroyed me in the sweetest of ways. I don't consider motherhood as something essential, something you need to experience because it's mandatory to feel like a real woman. If a person feels complete and accomplished without ever having kids, I totally support it, but as a mother who has a problematic mother, I think it's one more proof of the fact that Nesta's journey is heading to a genuinely happy path.“I’ll be with you every step of the way,” he whispered into her palm. “Just don’t lock me out. You want to walk in silence for a week, I’m fine with that. So long as you talk to me at the end of it.”Plotwise speaking, there wasn't much going on, but I enjoyed it, nonetheless.One of the chapters I liked the most is when Nesta, Cassian and Azriel (instert Brooklyn99 BoyleMy fantasy threesome!gif) went to the Bog of Oorid looking for the Mask.I was fucking terrified by the whole Kelpie encounter.And the gift sharing moment was e v e r y t h i n g.I love Az with all my heart sigh.Also, I adored basically every scene with Gwyn and Emerie, especially when they were together.Maas's writing is exquisite as usual. I'll never stop being amazed by how vividly I can picture in my mind the scenes she describes.The only plotline I wish was handled a little better was the Rhys/Feyre andyou know whatone. Every choice Rhys made fromthatpoint, felt a bit uncharacteristical and not well thought enough.I decided to blame it on the emotion, because I refuse to think our Rhys would be anything but pragmatic when it comes to his Feyre's safety.Sorry if all of this makes little sense. This book and this character in particular made me really emotional in a way I'd never thought I'd feel toward a fantasy book carachter.Oh, and to lighten up the mood after this sob fest...this book also taught me something I've suspected for a while now, and that is, that everyone in acotar wants a piece of Azriel. Who am I to disagree.Nesta could hardly remember words. But she found them when she whispered into the darkness, “Stay with me.”A shudder rocked through him, but he only smiled as he tucked her into his side.And warm and safe and home at last in Cassian’s arms, Nesta slept.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '”Your power is a song, and one I’ve waited a very, very long time to hear, Nesta”.Aviso: la primera parte de esta reseña va a estar libre despoilersy les diré cuando empiecen a aparecer para que puedan dejar de leerla si no quieren saber qué pasa.No sé por qué me sigo sorprendiendo de que Sarah J. Maas lo logre una y otra vez. Es absolutamente impresionante lo que esta mujer puede llegar a transmitir con sus palabras. De verdad, leyendo ACOSF sentí que me destrozaban hasta lo más hondo y que luego, poco a poco, me iban reconstruyendo y poniendo cada pieza en su lugar.Como muchos aquí, debo confesar que no estaba tan emocionada por este libro porque se centraría en Nesta. Pero, así mismo, tengo que admitir que me comí todas y cada una de mis reservas y que, leyendo cada página, entendí profundamente a Nesta, sus traumas, su sufrimiento, su personalidad, la culpa que siente todo el tiempo y la sensación de que nunca eres lo suficientemente bueno para nadie. Y no sólo la entendí, sino que me sentí jodidamente identificada. Y, claro, luego me di cuenta de que odiaba tantísimo a Nesta porque reflejaba las partes más horribles de mí misma.ACOSF es un libro tremendamente intenso y lleno de emociones, de momentos de confrontar los sentimientos más oscuros, de arrepentimientos, rabia y odio. Pero también es una historia que lleva a Nesta en un camino que le permite enfrentar todos los demonios que tiene por dentro, todas las cosas que se ha guardado durante años, las decisiones que le quitaron de las manos y su odio hacia sí misma. Y, a pesar de lo oscuro que es el pozo en el que está y de lo duro que es el camino, Nesta se va a dar cuenta de que siempre va a existir alguien al otro lado de esa oscuridad para tenderle una mano, para caminar junto a ella y para recordarle una y otra vez que sí que se merece el amor de sus amigos y de su familia. Que nunca va a estar sola.En serio, no les puedo decir con palabras lo hondo que me llegó esta historia al corazón. Sí, es el libro máshotde Sarah J. Maas y todas esas escenas están diseñadas para ser leídas mientras estás en una tina llena de hielo porque… joder. Y obviamente las marqué todas y casi me da un infarto leyendo otras. Y también mucha envidia. Pero más allá de eso, creo que eran una forma súper poderosa de comunicar lo mucho que Nesta necesitaba una distracción, salirse de sus pensamientos durante unos momentos… u horas (because Fae lovers, jajaja) porque estar dentro de su cabeza era demasiado doloroso. Y la entiendo.Y Cassian… ay, ¿cómo puede existir alguien tan bueno, valiente, sensible y paciente? Si amaron a Cassian en los libros anteriores, en este van a querer abrazarlo (y más cosas, ejem) hasta que todo esté bien para él. No se pueden imaginar todo lo que conocemos sobre Cassian en ACOSF, sobre su pasado, sus sentimientos, sus miedos y, sobre todo, cómo es tan genuino como para siempre demostrar lo mucho que le importan quienes son cercanos para él, todo lo que estaría dispuesto a hacer y soportar por ellos. En este libro, Cassian enfrenta toda la tormenta de proporciones épicas que significa estar cerca de Nesta, pero lo hace porque sabe que ella está en un lugar oscuro, que está luchando por salir de allí y él la entiende… porque ha estado él mismo en ese camino antes. Joder, es que, de verdad… después de leer este tipo de cosas, ves a las personas del mundo real y te das cuenta de que eso no existe. Ojalá todos pudiéramos tener la certeza de que, cuando salgamos de nuestros momentos más oscuros, siempre va a estar alguien allí esperándonos para decirnos que todo va a estar bien o incluso sólo para sonreírnos o abrazarnos.Ahora, obviamente todo el libro no se centra únicamente en Nesta y Cassian, sino que Sarah J. Maas nos presenta una nueva amenaza que puede, nuevamente, destruir todas las Cortes e incluso afectar al mundo de los humanos. Pero esta es una amenaza mucho más antigua, poderosa y letal de lo que el Rey de Hybern pudo llegar a ser. Más adelante hablaré de ello, pero me gustó que hubiera una historia paralela de conflicto, de magia arcana y de monstruos que no pueden volver a caminar libremente por el mundo.Antes de empezar con la sección despoilers, tengo que decirles que amé profundamente volver a ver a los personajes que adoro. Feyre, Rhysand, Mor, Amren y Azriel no son solamente sombras en el fondo de las escenas de ACOSF, sino que siguen siendo importantes y están allí para los momentos más críticos. Ahora, que ellos sean ligeramente menos importantes en este libro que Cassian y Nesta no quiere decir que Sarah J. Maas no los vaya a usar para rompernos el corazón, triturar los pedacitos, sumergirlos en ácido y luego incinerarlos. De verdad, es tremendo… Y lo único que diré, y que discutiré más a fondo más adelante, es que les juro que no pude parar de llorar con el último 10% del libro. Y no precisamente de felicidad.Vamos con losspoilersy con Isa perdiendo la cabeza… de nuevo.•••1. Sí, vamos a hablar de la dedicatoria del libro. Cuando la leí al principio dije como “oh, vaya, bueno”, pero ahora que la estoy releyendo y estoy escribiendo esta reseña, puedo decirles que casi lloro. Dice”For every Nesta out there, climb the mountain”.2. Las pesadillas que tiene Nesta nos dan una pista de todo lo que está batallando por dentro desde que la sumergieron en elCauldrony, joder, poco a poco entendemos por qué es como es. Nadie que lidie con pesadillas que describe como el frío antes de las estrellas, el vacío antes del infierno, puede siquiera fingir estar bien.3. ¿Cómo me atreví a juzgar a Nesta sin saber que ella sentía la inmortalidad como un fuego eterno y no como una serena juventud? Son estas pequeñas frases las que nos dan, incluso en las primeras páginas, las pistas que necesitamos para ver lo destrozada que está, que toda su mala actitud es una coraza para protegerse.4. Me rompe el corazón ver a Cassian al principio del libro admitiendo que el fuego helado de los ojos de Nesta siempre había sido una tentación para él. Y es que justo lo piensa cuando está en su apartamento destartalado en donde ella se ha estadofuckinga cuantos machos Fae quisiera y bebiendo hasta perder el conocimiento… Y lo peor es que Nesta tiene a un macho en su cuarto en ese momento. Agh.5. Y luego ella admite para sí misma que todo ese sexo con desconocidos, el alcohol y la música la ayuda a apagar un poco ese fuego frío y oscuro que la consume desde que la forzaron a entrar alCauldron. Nesta siempre ha estado muy rota y siento que la hemos juzgado demasiado sin saber exactamente lo mal que lo estaba pasando dentro de su cabeza.6. Lo triste es que hay una cita que dice que ese sexo no la hacía sentir nada más allá de un momento fugaz de liberación de ese poder cataclísmico que hay dentro de ella. Pero luego se ríe un poco y dice que incluso los siglos de experiencia que algunos machos Fae tienen no los hacen buenos en la cama, jajaja.7. EL HORROR del momento en el que Cassian vuelve a ese apartamento y le dice que se nota que ni siquiera se ha dignado a cambiar las sábanas entre sus visitantes PORQUE PUEDE OLERLOS. Dioses, en serio Nesta está en un punto muy bajo en ese momento.8. Es tremendo cuando Feyre y los demás le dan un ultimátum a Nesta: o accede a entrenar con Cassian por las mañanas y a ayudar a las acólitas de la biblioteca por las tardes e intenta enderezar su vida o la van a enviar de vuelta al mundo humano. Esa pelea y esa conversación son durísimas, pero tenían que darle un empujón para que empezara a salir de ese pozo.9. AMO A RHYSAND. Hay un momento en el que está hablando con Cassian después de la “intervention” de Nesta. Y Cass le dice que tiene que volver a entrenar porque no querría que Feyre, sumate, encontrara partes blandas en su cuerpo. Y RHYS RESPONDE QUE ELLA NUNCA ENCUENTRA NADA BLANDO Y OMG, JAJAJA. Y luego hablan de que Rhys les dio el día libre a los sirvientes y Cassian cree que es para que no los escuchen pelear después de lo de Nesta, pero Rhys le dice que no son las peleas lo que no quiere que escuchen, AIUDA.10. Se me rompió MAL el corazón cuando Cassian vio el retrato de Feyre y Rhys juntos, sus anillos y a ellos mismos y lo invadió ese sentimiento de querer lo que ellos tienen, a alguien especial a su lado. POBRECILLO MÍO.11. Ay, dioses, y más adelante Cassian dice que tiene que alejarse mucho de la casa del río porque no quiere ni oírlo ni sentir su poder cuando Rhys… acabe. PERO ES QUE ESO NO ES TODO. Luego menciona como quien no quiere la cosa que, cuando eran más jóvenes, Az, Rhys y Cassian se f*llaban a muchísimas hembras Y GENERALMENTE EN LA MISMA HABITACIÓN. ¿ES QUE NADIE VA A HABLAR DE ESTO? O sea… dioses. A mí nadie me puede quitar de la cabeza que esos tres…you know. QUIERO UNFANFICDE ESTO YA MISMO.12. AMO cada vez que Cassian molesta a Nesta recordándole lo mucho que le gusta leer novelas eróticas, jajaja.13. Uf, también me rompe el corazón los momentos en los que Nesta admite para sí misma que sabe lo desagradable que es con los demás, lo dura que es la coraza que la rodea y lo asustada que está ella misma de ese pozo infinito de poder oscuro que tiene dentro de ella. Y hay una cita en la que dice que siempre se sintió cómoda siendo como un lobo, como un depredador, pero que cuando llegó el momento de eliminar a ese ser feroz, se dio cuenta de que la había devorado incluso a ella.14. Ehhh… ¿podemos hablar de que Rhys sigue siendo un loquillo? Es que le habla por el vínculo mental a Cassian en medio de dos… eh…roundscon Feyre,if you know what I mean.15. A ver, todos sabemos que, tarde o temprano, Cassian y Nesta van a hacerlo sobre todas las superficies de la Casa, pero es que toda la tensión previa es la que me matabaaaaaa. ¡La tensión y las frases con doble sentido y los gruñidos bajos! En el primer día de entrenamiento, Cassian le dice a Nesta, con voz súper grave, que le alegra que se haya levantado lista para jugar. Y ELLA SE DERRITE AUNQUE NUNCA LO ACEPTARÁ EN VOZ ALTA… todavía.16. PERO LO QUE SÍ RECUERDA ES ESE MOMENTO EN LA BATALLA FINAL, ahhhh. O sea, cuando pensaron que iban a morir y él la besó y le dijo que desearía haber tenido más tiempo, pero que la encontrará en esta vida y las siguientes. Es que me muero. Y Nesta admite mentalmente que nunca deja de pensar en ese momento. Ayyyyyy, ya bésenseeeee.17. Sarah J. Maas me quiere matar porque luego Nesta dice que si Cassian cree que todo esto de entrenar va a terminar con ella subiéndose a su cama, que está muy equivocado. Y él dice que eso está clarísimo, que él no se va a subir a la cama de ella, PORQUE ES ELLA QUIEN VA A SUPLICAR ESTAR EN LA CAMA DE CASSIAN. AYUDA, NECESITO AGUA FRÍA.18. Y no soy la única que necesita hielo porque cuando Cassian ve a Nesta en losIllyrian leathersde entrenar, que son pantalones y equipo muy ajustado, el pobre casi muere y empieza a fantasear sobre todo lo que haría quitándole esos pantalones y… uf.19. Y justo después de esas fantasías Cassian recuerda que no ha tenido más compañía que su mano desde hace más de dos años, cuando lo hizo duro y rápido contra una pared de ladrillo con una hembra cualquiera que encontró en un bar. O SEA, CASSIAN ESTÁHORNYY LA QUE NOS ESPERA EN ESTE LIBRO… MADRE DE TODOS LOS DIOSES.20. Esos primeros días de entrenamiento cuando Cassian lleva a Nesta a Windhaven y ella se niega a levantarse de una roca y entrenar son tremendos. Y es obvio que todos losillyrianse están burlando de Cassian por dejar que una mujer tan terca le gane… y aunque Nesta sabe que lo está haciendo ver débil y lo odia, no puede ceder porque siente que es mejor que la odie a que se acerque. MI CORAZÓN.21. Parte de la razón por la que este libro me enseñó a no odiar a Nesta es que entendemos mucho más cómo piensa. Y me identifiqué un montón, de verdad. Verla a ella era verme a mí en los momentos más horrorosos de salud mental. Cuando ella dice que odia todo lo que es, que está absolutamente exhausta y que está cansada de querer estar en un lugar que no sea su cabeza… wow.I felt that.22. Me encantó la conversación que tienen Amren y Cassian en la que ella le dice que deje que Nesta cave su propia tumba, pero que al final le ofrezca su mano. Que no se rinda y siga ofreciéndole su ayuda para salir de ese lugar oscuro.23. FAAAAAAAN de que Lucien diga que Tamlin está sufriendo y que desde el final de la guerra no ha adoptado su forma Fae, sino que está vagando por su corte como la bestia que es.Fucker.24. Sabes que se vienen problemas cuando empiezas a enterarte de que las criaturas poderosísimas que inclinaron la balanza en favor de la Corte de la Noche tienen hermanos. En este caso, nos presentan a Koschei, el hermano delBone Carver. Y que parece que está aliado con Briallyn, una de las reinas que entró alCauldrony que ahora quiere recuperar laDread Trove, una colección de objetos poderosísimos, hechos por elCauldronmismo, que tiene el poder de empezar otra guerra y borrarlos a todos del mapa.Oh, joy.25. Hay una mañana en la que Nesta casi no puede moverse porque la noche anterior intentó bajar las 10.000 escaleras que separan a la Casa de Velaris. Y Cassian se da cuenta en el desayuno y la molesta con que no se puede ni parar. Y ella lo hace apoyándose un montón en sus manos, pero él le dice que no cuenta si son las manos las que están haciendo todo el trabajo. Y ELLA LE DICE QUE SON SUS MANOS LAS QUE DEBEN ESTAR OCUPADAS TODAS LAS NOCHES, OMG. Entonces Cassian le responde con voz grave que si es eso lo que le enseñan sus libros eróticos, que sólo se hace por la noche. Él nota Y HUELE lohotque se pone ella y sigue diciendo que se puede hacer en cualquier momento, con la luz del día, durante un baño o incluso después de una LARGA Y DURA sesión de entrenamiento. En serio, lean este libro con hielo a la mano.26. ¡Lo peor es que toda esa conversación sucede mientras Az también está en la mesa con ellos! Y al final, cuando Nesta se va, Azriel le dice a Cassian que lo va a tener muy jodido, pero él ya no lo está ni escuchando porque en su cabeza se está imaginando todo lo que las manos de Nesta podrían hacer con él y JODER, LES DIJE QUE ESTE LIBRO ES DEMASIADO CALIENTE. Y ESO QUE NO HA SUCEDIDO NADA.27. Uf, golpe bajo cuando, en medio de una pelea porque Nesta sigue negándose a entrenar en Windhaven, Cassian también explota y ella le responde diciéndole que genial, que menos mal ya no lo va a tener babeando detrás de ella y que le costó mucho entender las señales de que ella no lo quería. Y MALDITA SEA, OBVIAMENTE LO QUIERES. Y ÉL A TI. Pero también entiendo la reacción de querer alejar a todo el mundo cuando ni tú te soportas a ti misma.***SIGUE EN COMENTARIOS***'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""3.5 stars.here comes the post-series hangover.it's safe to say that this series has my entire heart.nesta’s redemption arc is 751 pages of smutty illyrian desperation (maybe slightly too smutty?!) and self discovery. i now like nestabecausei’ve also disliked her. the ugliest parts of nesta are things that i recognize in myself and that’s the beauty of this book.✨a court of smut and self-help.✨and, of course, men with wings are just superior in every way.🤍 i need azriel to get his own booknow(though preferably not with elain lol)(acowar & acomaf remain my favorites from this series, but i can’t wait to see what sjm has in store for books 5 and 6.)""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '[2022] edit:changed my mind this is more of a 4 star than a 5🙃_________________I\'m sobbing that was so beautifulAll hailQueen Nestaand SJM for making melove her so muchI don\'t know what to do with myself now.Like actually, I think I\'m gonna be in a book hangover forweeks— no,monthsomg I cannot.

My love for SJM will never cease to exist.═══*.·:·.☽✧ ✦ ✧☾.·:·.*═══🛑Note: The first part will have NO SPOILERS, while the 2nd will definitely have SPOILERS. I\'ll have a warning when it comes to that.═══*.·:·.☽✧ ✦ ✧☾.·:·.*═══""Everyone deserves happiness. The road there isn\'t easy. It is long, and hard, and often travelled utterly blind. But you keep going.Because you know the destination will be worthwhile.""This isNesta\'s special journey. Nesta\'s journey through dealing with her trauma. Struggling with the pain she\'s been in and healing.Finding the ability to love herself.I didn\'t think SJM could write a better book for mental health than ACOMAF, but I believe right here, she didexactlythat. There wasn\'t a single scene where I didn\'t feel likemy heart was breaking.This was such an emotional ride. I could actually relate to Nesta and while it isn\'t as severe as her, there are times where I\'d also hate myself and feel like I deserve nothing. And seeing Nesta deal with all of this --it broke me in so many ways. To have her in so much pain and think that she herself has to change in order to be ""fixed""... ohmygod no I swear I cant.😭🤚Then there was Cassian. I love how he wouldn\'t give up on Nesta and even while trying to help her, he still didn\'t let her get away with everything.He kept reaching out his handthroughout it all. But in the end, the only person who could heal Nesta wasNesta herself.You can help someone as much as you want, but at the end of all that, it\'s up to them tosee past that darkness and find the light. Tolove themselvesandbe happywith who they are.To heal the parts of you that hurt so much and hurt others.im crying again dammitThis book hit me so hard. I\'m actually such a mess. I never thought I could love a book this much. Not surprised it was Queen SJM that did this to me.I willneverforget the impact Nesta\'s story had on me. There\'s no doubt that I\'ll be rereading this so many times in the future. Already I feel like rereading. My god, what has she done to me *sobs* is this what love feels like?═══*.·:·.☽✧ ✦ ✧☾.·:·.*═══🛑SPOILER part of the review below. Do not go past this if you haven\'t read ACOSF.🛑═══*.·:·.☽✧ ✦ ✧☾.·:·.*═══She would not be mastered by anything again. She was the master of herself.I know I talked about Nesta already but seriously she\'s such a queen. Cassian wasn\'t the only one there for her. We\'re introduced to new characters in this book andI love it. Honestly, it had to be my favourite part of her story.Nesta\'s friendship with Emerie and Gwyn was so, so,so wholesome and sweet.Each of them had their own past that haunted them and were afraid for the other to find out.But that\'s exactly what made them fit so well together.That moment where they all shared their secrets with each other, realizing that the other wouldn\'t be judging them...I cried so muchnot surprisingomg it was so beautiful to see them open up.Their love for each other was tested especially when they had to participate in The Blood Rite. I was so shook, I actually didn\'t think they\'d be doing it, but ohmygodthat was so stressful. I was terrified SJM would destroy me again and kill Emerie or Gwyn.Thank god she took pity on our poor hearts.Also, omg them training to be Valkyries dsfdsfgd YES YESYES. I LOVED that so much. And to see them in action during The Blood Rite against those bastards???Perfection.but also really stressful bc my gurls🥺ALSO THE FRIENDSHIP BRACELETS OHMYGOD I CANNOT.HEARTBREAKING AND BEAUTIFUL.I legit hope Gwyn and Emerie play bigger roles in the next two books, especially *ahem* because I have some ships in mind.😏 Yes, I may be too early but I believe in EmeriexMor and AzrielxGwyn🙏═══*.·:·.☽✧ ✦ ✧☾.·:·.*═══""The first time I saw that look on your face, you were still human. Still human, and I nearly went to my knees before you.""Tell me, what\'s one of the most heartbreaking scenes you\'ve ever read?I\'ll tell you mine --CHAPTER 50. That was so heart-wrenching, my heart died. My own sisters were looking at me like I was insane. But something even more heartbreaking?CASSIANCRYINGThat completely and utterly destroyed me. I was dying on the inside. Just thinking about him crying, is making me cry. I swear to god, I literally putmy heart through torture reading this.Seeing through Cassian\'s POV is the greatest gift we could\'ve asked for. All the flaws and insecurities he feels, I\'m in so muchp a i n. I adore himeven morethan before. He was there for Nesta and Nesta was there for him, my heart-""Forgiveness is not that easy.""""Forgiveness is something we also grant ourselves. And I can talk to you until these mountains crumble around us, but if you don\'t wish to be forgiven, if you don\'t want to stop feeling this way...it won\'t happen.""Hello? Please stop destroying me.Please, Cas.""You don\'t need to become some impossible ideal. You don\'t need to become sweet and simpering. You can give everyone thatI Will Slay My Enemieslook—which is my favourite look, by the way. You can keep that sharpness I like so much, that boldness and fearlessness. I don\'t want you to ever lose things, to cage yourself.""STOP. THE. PAIN. *cries* Cas, when did you become so wise and give such heart crushing speeches?? This is one of the most beautiful lines I\'ve ever read. No question about it.Also, to finally find out what was in the solstice gift Cassian wanted to give Nesta -- it wasA BOOK.Okay imma stop right there, I\'m crying again. I cant do this.🥺😭(And Azzy & Nesta\'s friendship...*sobs* beautiful. HE GAVE HER AFAELIGHT FOR READING AS A SOLSTICE GIFT. PLEASE, MY HEART-)═══*.·:·.☽✧ ✦ ✧☾.·:·.*═══""That\'s the key, isn\'t it? To know the darkness will always remain, but how you choose to face it, handle it...that\'s the important part. To not let it consume. To focus upon the good, the things that fill you with wonder.""""The struggle with that darkness is worth it, just to see such things.""Am I really dedicating a whole section toThe House of Wind?Yes, yes I am.I absolutelyloveNesta, but my god The House of Wind is the BEST part of this book. Absolutely amazing and kind. I didn\'t I could lovea houseso much, but here I am.Nesta wished for a friend and the House became that friend for her. It encouraged her to do more, pushed her to try more. The Housereads romance novels. I\'m crying, I love the House so much. And the darkness that swirled at the bottom of the library?? I can\'t believe that was theheartof the House ohmygod please I love it. The way Nesta accepted the way it was, just like the House did that for her...sdfgdsfs I\'m in pain. *sobs* too much for my heart.AND IT GAVE NESTA CHOCOLATE CAKE AND ROMANCE BOOKS.What\'s not to love about the House???woah wait, why is this reminding me of celaena with her love of chocolate cake and books *shook*The House of Wind ise v e r y t h i n g.═══*.·:·.☽✧ ✦ ✧☾.·:·.*═══""I went into the Cauldron, too, you know. And it capturedme.And yet somehow all you think of is whatmytrauma did toyou.""(This is Nesta\'s book, but I justhaveto say this.)I\'m guilty of this too, but I think most of us hated Elain because of how we saw her, being sweet, kind and useless...and judged her right away,forgetting that she also is stillsufferinggoing into the Cauldron and with what happened in the war against Hybern.Just like Nesta, Elain has a different way of showing her trauma and that\'s byhiding it awayand making it look like she\'s okay, using the image everyone thinks of her being--sweet and kind. It\'s just like we all think of her and hate her for that. Everyone expects Elain to be one thing, so she acts like that BUTis that truly Elain?So yeah, I judged her too early. (Feysand\'s POV really helped with this too) I shouldn\'t hate her right away because there\'s still her story to be told. I\'m actually excited to see that.But even knowing all of this, I still don\'t like Elain.🤷\u200d♀️ I understand it and everything but just something about her rubs me off the wrong way. I don\'t hate her, but I don\'t like her either. I have no doubt Sarah will make us love, or at the very least, like Elain next book.Also, I seriously do not ship her with Azriel.I believeAzriel and Gwynwould be such a beautiful pair ohmygod I\'d love that so much. If the three brothers get with the three archeron sisters...no no no,pleaseno. And I absolutely love the Azriel POV. My heart is hurting so much for Azzy🥺 He needs the love he deserves.Omg every time he\'d appear as the""chaperone""for Nesta and Cassian--omg I was dying of laughter. I loved those scenes. Poor Azzy having to deal with Nesta and Cas, tsk tsk naughty Fae. But the friendship between Nesta and Azzy ohmygod my heart, im crying it was so beautiful. Azzy have NestaAlso, something else as to why I think AzrielxElain wont be endgame is because during the solstice dance, both Cas and Eris talk about how smothered/plain Elain is wearing black, which I feel like is SJM\'s way of saying thatElain isn\'t compatible with The Night Court and it\'s darkness & shadows.ahhh I truly feel like she\'s going to go to another court in the next book.Also Azzy\'s shadowsdisappearwhen they\'re around Elain. Meanwhile, the shadowsdontdisappear around Gwyn...they come alive around her. I don\'t know about you, but it looks like SJM is trying to say something👀I stan Gwynriel“I am the rock against which the surf crashes.""“Nothing can break me.”AND THE FACT THAT AZZY SINGS AND GWYN SINGS SDFGSDFD I CANT😭🤚═══*.·:·.☽✧ ✦ ✧☾.·:·.*═══""I\'ll deny it to the grave if you tell anyone, but I missed you too, Cursebreaker.""Helion is amazing sdfgdsfsdf I love him so much. I think we can all agree withneedingmore Helion these next few books. And for Lucien to find out the truth🥺 We need a Lucien book so bad omg so many books needed.I\'m so curious as to what really was going on when Nesta asked about Jurian & Vassa and Lucien replied sharply HMM I may be reading too much into that, but something\'s going on ughhh I wanna know more about those three.ALSO,ERIS. There is SO MUCH MORE to Eris then is shown. I really want to see more Eris and his story. I believe there\'s a lot more to him and Cas even sees that he\'s a decent guy.Oh, another thing I forgot to mention was the fact thatNesta Made three magic weaponsand one of them she named the swordAtaraxia, which meansInner Peace...I\'m in love. I stan Nesta so much. She grew to be so much stronger than she was before annnnnd the tears are coming in again.😃✌This reminds me of Feyre and Nesta\'s relationship. *sobs* It brings me joy to see thetwo finally understand and show their love for each other. No matter what, Feyre wouldn\'t give up on her either. She tried so hard to help Nesta and I love Feyre so much for that. Unlike *cough* some people *cough* Rhysand. I actually despise him SO MUCH, it was so messed up. The way I hate this guy with every fibre of my being😃Although, I have to say that when Nesta apologized to everyone it irked me. Like yeah, she did say harmful things to them, but the Inner Circle did too?? Honestly, they should\'ve apologized too, mainly Rhys and Amren but ah, that didn\'t happen *rage* they should grovel at her feet.OMG WAIT. JUST ONE MORE THING I REALIZED.THIS:THAT WASAELIN.

",Sarah J. Maas,3.74,1598204,414246,"Fantasy, Romance, Romantasy, Young Adult, Fiction, New Adult, Fantasy Romance",272,01-05-2018,"Feyre, Rhysand, and their friends are still busy rebuilding the Night Court and the vastly altered world beyond, recovering from the war that changed everything. But Winter Solstice is finally approaching, and with it, the joy of a hard-earned reprieve.Yet even the festive atmosphere can't keep the shadows of the past from looming. As Feyre navigates her first Winter Solstice as High Lady, her concern for those dearest to her deepens. They have more wounds than she anticipated-scars that will have a far-reaching impact on the future of their court.Bridging the events ofA Court of Wings and Ruinwith the later books in the series,A Court of Frost and Starlightexplores the far-reaching effects of a devastating war and the fierce love between friends.","[{'rating': 3, 'content': '”Mother above and Cauldron save me.”Yep, that’s exactly what I thought when I read another one of Feyre and Rhy’s naughty scenes! The words might have been the same; my thoughts came with an eye roll instead of pleasure though. As did a lot of other things while I read this novella. Don’t get me wrong, I still enjoyed almost every second of this and it was really nice to spend some time with all those characters again BUT (yes, it’s a big but) there were a lot of things that didn’t sit well with me and you can bet your lovely behind on the fact that I’m going to point them out later on when I get to the spoilery parts of this review.Generally speaking this wasn’t bad. We got to see a little bit of our characters normal lives and I think we can all agree that after everything they went through they deserve some normalcy and happiness. It was nice to walk through Velaris, to go Solstice shopping with Mor and Feyre and to see those beloved characters interact with each other. They all survived the war and each and every single one of them is trying to cope with the aftermath. There are plenty of wounds that still need to heal and I’m kind of grateful Sarah decided to give her characters some room to come to terms with everything. So yes, this novella might not have a huge plot but definitely provides a good transition into the next series. ;-)Still, there were quite a lot of interesting dialogues and a bunch of things that either made me happy or caused me to get angry. Mostly it was the relationships between the characters and so this is exactly what I’m going to write about. Buckle up! This is going to be a hard ride! *lol*From here on out, I’ll talk about the relationships and ships of the characters, so this isn’t only going to be rant and gush feast but also a spoiler celebration! If you still continue to read and haven’t read ACOFAS yet, it’s at your own risk! Don’t say I didn’t warn you! ;-)The relationships & ships:Feyre & Rhys:”But you are bothering – you’re both still working to make this peace last. Peace, Rhys. We have peace, and the true kind. Enjoy it – enjoy each other. You paid the debt before it was ever a debt.”I totally agree with Cassian and even though this might sound harsh now I still need to say it: I want them to enjoy each other too, but please not as the MCs of the following books. I love Feyre and Rhys, I really do, but I think from ACOWAR on out their character development was kind of detrimental. I already mentioned it in my review of ACOWAR and I’ll say it again Feyre’s and Rhys’s holier-than-thou attitude is beginning to get on my nerves. Feyre and her friends weren’t the only ones that suffered and it would be really nice if she’d get out of her pink bubble and would acknowledge the fact that others hurt too! It’s good that Rhys and her have each other but not everyone is as lucky as them and it would help to remember that they made mistakes too! Also if I read about “toes that curl” in Feyre’s boots one more time I’m going to be sick. Yes, we got it, Rhys is such a sexy male and they really love each other. If you ask me their story should have ended after ACOWAR because right now I have more negative feelings towards them than positive ones and this is actually kinda sad. >_< Okay, Feysand shippers are allowed to take out their pitchforks and torches now... Just give me a little head start, will you? ;-PFeyre & Lucien:”And what, exactly, does this Band of Exiles plan to do? Host events? Organize party-planning committees?”Lucien’s metal eye clicked faintly and narrowed. “You can be as much of an asshole as that mate of yours, you know that?”I think Feyre was a real bitch to Lucien in this book. And no, I’m not sorry for saying it out loud. After all someone has to do it and I don’t mind it being me. I mean if she really wants him to be friends with her, she has to accept that he has his own life and doesn’t want to depend on her and Rhys. If she’d be honest to herself she’d realize that Lucien isn’t welcome at her court and that he has his reasons to stay away from them. I think the only two people who feel real sympathy for Lucien are Az and Amren and they only do it to some extent. So yeah, she can’t expect him to be happy with the situation. Lucien lost so much over the centuries and now he even lost Tam and his second home. It’s not Feyre’s call to decide what’s best for him! Especially because she’s actually the reason why Lucien isn’t welcome at Tam’s place anymore. So nope, take care of your own court and leave Lucien be! Thank you very much! And a huge YAY for Lucien! Because he dared to call Feyre and Ryhs out on their bullsh*t and didn’t back down! That’s my man!!! <333 Also I totally agree with him! Rhys shouldn’t have said what he did and the way he treated Tam cost him a lot of my sympathy.”Your mate should have known better than to kick a downed male.””I can’t stand to be in the same room as her for more than two minutes. I can’t stand to be in this court and have your mate pay for the very clothes on my back.”Elain & Lucien:”He hadn’t mentioned Elain, or his proximity to her. Elaine had not asked him to stay, or to go. And whether she cared about the bruises on his face, she certainly hadn’t let on.”So if you already put away your pitchforks and torches, guess now is the right time to draw them out again, because this isn’t going to be nice and tell you what: I actually don’t care! I’ll say it as it is: I HATE Elain! There, I said it! And I’m not even sorry for it! You think Nesta is a witch? Oh well, guess Elain is even worse because she hides it behind her super sweet appearance and gentle actions. By now I’ve reached a point where I despise her and I’m sick and tired of everyone defending this woman just because she is so sweet! Where was Elain when Feyre was taken by Tam? What did Elain do when Feyre went out hunting for them? Nesta might be a witch, and I can’t even believe I’m saying this, but at least she went looking for Feyre. What did Elain do? She got engaged to Grayson! YAY! Way to go! Also everyone loving precious and dear Elain! WTF?!!! Did Elain ever do anything except of looking lovely?! (Yes, she might be a great cook and good at gardening but seriously is that all!???!!!) AND WHY THE FREAKING HELL IS EVERYONE DEFENDING ELAIN WITH THE WORDS “Elain is Elain”!??? ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?? WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN!!?? I’m sick and tired of her getting away with everything because she’s everybody’s darling! Lucien deserves so much better than that! She can’t even talk to him for a few minutes? She can’t even thank him for the present he got her? Where was her present for him?! And just for the record: LUCIEN DIDN’T WANT HER TO BE HIS MATE!!! He’s as innocent when it comes to their mating bond as Elain! It’s not his fault that they are mates and people better remember this when they judge him for trying to get to know her! She doesn’t even give him a chance to get to know her so she’s just cruel and mean in my eyes. If she doesn’t change her attitude in the next trilogy I’ll never ship her with anyone. Not even Az. No one! For all I care she can live with her precious flowers and become one of them! GRRRRRRR!!!! AKDFASDFJASLDFJKASDFLK! Okay, I’m fine now. XD”Elain, at least, would be too polite to send Lucien away when he wanted to help. She was too polite to send him away on a normal day. She just ignored him or barely spoke to him until he got the hint and left.”Those doe-brown eyes turned toward me. Sharper than I’d ever seen them. “And that entitles him to my time, my affections?”“No.” I blinked. “But he is a good male.” Despite our harsh words. Despite this Band of Exiles bullshit. “He cares for you.”“He doesn’t know me.”“You don’t give him the chance to even try to do so.”Cassian & Nesta:”A storm is going to hit in a few days. I’d like you to distribute this amongst those who might feel its impact the hardest.”Cassian is so, so damn precious and he’s stuck with Nesta! That’s not fair! I think when it comes to me disliking characters in this series it’s a tie between Nesta and Elain. I just hate them both. (I know I’m making a lot of friends with this review. *lol* But I just can’t help it!) I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to ship them but after seeing that Nesta still didn’t change... Well, I just can’t ship them. By now I don’t even know if her character can be redeemed and if Sarah doesn’t work her magic with her I’ll never board this ship. And it will take a HUGE amount of magic to make her character at least a little bit more likable! And to everyone out there who likes Nesta and thinks I’m mean: I know she has PTSD too and I know that she suffers at least as much as all the other characters around her do, but that’s no reason to lash out at the others. If she wants to be secluded from them, live in a cheap apartment, drink all day and sleep with every fae male that comes her way: Okay! But to hurt the others, to fight them even though they are trying to help her, to spend Feyre’s and Rhys money without asking them: That’s not okay!! How many people have to offer her help until she accepts it? How often will she hurt poor Cassian because she’s just too proud to acknowledge that she has a serious problem? Just like Lucien, Cassian deserves so much better than her and I think I’ll make a petition for both of them! #FreeCassian&LucienFromTheClutchesOfTheCruelArcheronSisters”Nesta is Nesta. She does what she wants, even if it kills her sister. I’ve offered her job after job, and she refuses them all.”Tamlin & Rhys:Forgiveness could be a gift to both, but what he’d done... “Do you want her to?”His green eyes were empty. “Do I deserve it?”No. Never.He must have read it on my face, because he asked, “Do you forgive me – for your mother and sister?”I’m not okay with the way Rhys treated Tamlin! Yes, he made mistakes, yes he hurt Feyre, but that doesn’t mean that they have to hurt him too! Rhys should have known better than that, he should have been better than that and he shouldn’t have kicked Tam when he was already on the ground. Everyone can see that Tamlin is hurting and to treat him like that? To say what Rhys said to him? WOAH!! That was just cruel, mean and uncalled-for. I’m feeling really sorry for Tam now and Rhys helping him with the elk doesn’t make this any better. He only helped him because he might need him in future, not because he actually cared. Where is your compassion for Tam, Rhys? Where is the Rhys of ACOMAF I fell in love with? I don’t see him anymore. *shakes head*”I hope you live the rest of your miserable life alone here. It’s a far more satisfying end than slaughtering you.”Elain & Az:Cassian sat up, the portrait of outrage. “No?”Azriel tucked in his wings. “Would you want people betting on you?”I think the only reason Az reacted like that is because he might feel guilty for liking Elain. It’s so obvious that Sarah wants them to end up together and all those little tense moments between them speak volumes about her intentions. But as I said: I can’t ship Elain with anyone right now. Az is too sweet and gentle to end up with her and I really don’t want them to be together. Not because I would begrudge him a relationship with her, but because I think that he deserves better than her. After Mor played with him for centuries Az deserves the world, and then some! If Elain doesn’t change and acknowledges her misbehaviour against Lucien then I can’t ship this ship. And quite honestly, if I’d be Az I wouldn’t want to be with someone who treats their mate like that.”Azriel emerged from the sitting room, a glass of wine in hand and wings tucked back to reveal his fine, yet simple black jacket and pants.I felt, more than saw, my sister go still as he approached. Her throat bobbed.”Rhys & Lucien:”I can let go of the taunts,” he said, scanning my face. “And the fact that he still harbors some hope of one day reuniting with Tamlin. But I cannot let go of how he treated you after Under the Mountain.”I’m just glad that Lucien became friends with Vassa and Jurian because as I already mentioned above, he obviously isn’t welcome at the Night Court. Rhys still doesn’t like him and Lucien deserves more than to be tolerated. He deserves to be respected, to be loved and cherished and not to be treated like sh*t! Also what the hell does Rhys even mean with how he treated Feyre after Under the Mountain? Lucien did nothing wrong, he was there for her, tried to help her, defended her against Tam, spoke up for her and confronted Tamlin. And what did he get in return? Tamlin reprimanded him and might have even physically hurt him, Ianthe abused him and Tam let it happen because he refused to take part in the ritual, and Feyre?! Do I really have to point out what Feyre did? She lied to him, claimed that Rhys had turned her and even after she came back to the spring court she continued to lie to him and hurt him even more by destroying the only place he called home. Hell, she even used him to antagonize Tam and to destroy his friendship with Lucien. A great friend she was to him! And this after everything he did for her Under the Mountain. Hell, he even got whipped because he helped her and almost died as well. To destroy your friends’ life is a great way to show him gratitude. Well done, Feyre! So WHO EXACTLY TREATED WHOM LIKE SH*T AFTER UNDER THE MOUNTAIN, RHYS???!!!! Mhmm??? Care to enlighten me? And one more thing before I come to the end of thisrantreview: Lucien was in no position to help Feyre because he suffered from PTSD too. That’s something everyone always seems to forget. You can’t help someone else if you’re drowning yourself. And people better keep that in mind before they talk badly about him.Conclusion:I really thought I’d enjoy this novella and then move on to the next trilogy but for some reason those 229 pages kinda irked me. Big time. *lol* I guess that’s mostly due to the fact that all the things I already criticized in ACOWAR seemed to be even more prominent in this short story and I just couldn’t ignore it any longer. Also all the chapters we got from Mor’s POV didn’t contribute anything to the story, which is the main reason I didn’t even mention her in my review. All told this was a nice addition to the first trilogy and a good segue into the next one and I really hope that Sarah J. Maas will tackle all those issues I just pointed out. After all, “Hope dies last”! ;-PThis fanart was made by:https://twitter.com/Niruskyart'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '✨Hardcore SJM fans need not engage, kindly move along without reading this review.✨Me after finishing the book:IM FREEEEEE!!!!!!!! WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY FUCKING LIFESo let’s start by sayingthis book wasalmostentirely useless.Things this book has:• lots of walking around Velaris• shopping for presents• lots of bad innuendos• me physically rolling my eyes every two pages• way too much internal monologue about who had fucked whom, where and in which position• one really long and really cringy sex scene•somehow galaxies were involved in the sex scene and that’s not even the weirdest thing that’s ever happened in a sjm sex scene• mate mate mate mate mate m a t e ma te ma t e mat e m ate mAtE mATe MATE matE M a te• ""gentlemales""• I repeat:g e n t l e m a l e s• a few cute moments• a few funny moments•a tiny bit of actual fucking foundation for the next booksBasicallyFeyre and Rhys need to retireand let secondary characters finally have the spotlight.* The only POVs I genuinely enjoyed were Cassian’s and Nesta’s, which, surprise surprise, will be the focus of the next book. Fucking finally.*except SJM has a talent for ruining main characters so what happens when secondary characters become the main ones? Uhhh we shall find out I guess.Speaking more generally,this book was just mostly bad.I’m not only talking aboutthe writing, whichneeded a lot of editing, but the general feeling surrounding it all. Starting from the blurb, which is just a few sentences from the first chapter copypasted together. People, the blurb doesn’t even make sense. That extra sentence about snow? It shouldn’t be there. They obviously needed one more sentence to make the blurb longer and didn’t know what else to pick. It’s just bad. Whoever did that did a very poor job.* And that makes me angry.*EDIT: oh boy they changed the blurb!!! More than a full week after the book released! But I got receipts. #NeverForgetTheBlurbAuthors, even big ones, still have to fight hard to see their books picked up by publishers, be sold, and then be read and hyped by readers. But apparently that rule doesn’t apply to SJM.The publisher doesn’t even put any effort in pre-release things like writing a decent blurb, because they know her books are going to sell anyway. And I mean, I’m here writing this review because I’ve read this book despite swearing that I was done with this series after ACOWAR, because she has a talent for making you want to know what happens to the characters, even if (especially if) they’re not the main ones.But the least the author and the publisher could do is put some fucking effort and deliver a product that’s better than this. Instead, it feels likeeither SJM is a rare case of writer who gets worse every book she writes, or the publisher has decided that she’s still going to sell regardless how many rounds of editing her books get,so they might as well never edit them, thus never delivering a polished book.Because, folks, we might have started making fun of the wordm*tefor shits and giggles, but it’s become a big fucking problem, especially in this book. You know the writing advice that says to just use someone’s name when talking about them, instead of saying, idk, “the French girl,” or “the red-haired boy”? SJM has never heard of it. Think about your own internal monologue. Do you think of your spouse as “my spouse” all the time? Or do you simply think about them with their name?Cassian and my mate’s sister did not speak to each other at all.This sentence just does not flow. And it’s just one of about 70 times the word m*te was used (and keep in mind this is a 200 pages book).I wonder how many creative writing students failed their assignments for doing exactly what the most hyped YA fantasy author these days does constantly.Do we also want to have The Talk about theweird connotations and implicationsthat this word has? Oh boy, this conversation is about three years late, but I absolutely Do Not like all this animalistic shit, starting with m*te, moving on to how many times people purr, referring to people as males and females (ah, the good ol’ binary) (YES I FUCKING KNOW SHE CAN’T CALL THEM MEN AND WOMEN BUT JFC JUST STOP), to the weird possessiveness that the whole m*ting system entails. Also!!! Toxic masculinity!!!!!!! Weird unchallenged sexist comments!!!!! Trying to make Rhys sound soooo feminist when apparently his job is being horny 24/7!!!!!! Have Rhys (a literal sexual abuse victim) talk about how hecan’t standto be next to his m*te without, and I quote, BEING BURIED INSIDE HER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ohhhh now you\'ve done it, you got me mad. If you read a SJM book it seems like thinking/talking/having sex for most part of your day is the normalcy. Which it can be!!!! But guess what! Ace people exist!!!! People with low sexual drive exist!!!!!!!!!! That’s normal too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh no I’m using too many exclamation points let me hire an editor. When every single character you portray acts the same exact way towards something like sex, you’re telling your readers (mostly teens) that that’s what’s expected of them, that that’s how everyone is like. It’s no secret that diversity doesn’t exist in SJM’s world, and that involves how people view sex and romantic relationships too.It’s amazing that YA books have sex positivity.But books need to also acknowledge that ace people exist too. Protagonists and love interests that aren’t some sort of sex gods need to be there too. Thin boys, fat boys, trans boys need to be there too.If after >10 books a writer can’t get out of her own self-insert fantasies about what type of men she likes, maybe she isn’t a great writer after all.Maybe she needs to listen to the (still too small) part of her readers that demand More, that demand Better.I went on a HUGE tangent and I don\'t even fucking care. There were parts of the book that I liked. I even enjoyed most of its central part. I enjoyed Nesta’s PTSD portrayal and she’s the only reason I’m going to read the next book because parts of her trauma and her way of dealing with it have the potential to mean so fucking much to me. But I’m going to lower my rating to 1 star because I’m tired of all the things I mentioned above,I\'m tired of being treated like shit by an author and her team because they expect me to worship her when she doesn\'t even try anymore.My 1 star isn\'t even gonna change anything because everyone’s giving this the usual five stars, but I don’t care. I’m here and as a readerI demand better, I demand the bare fucking minimum, and I don’t think this book even tried.This was a buddy read withmy bon m@te(I’m sorry)____Correct me if I\'m wrong but shouldn\'t blurbs, like, tell you something about the book..........why is this one just a recap of the previous ones lmaoAlso shout-out to sjm for managing to squeeze the word ""mate"" within like 100 words of bad blurb'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '#1A Court of Thorns and Roses★★★★★#2A Court of Mist and Fury★★★★★#3A Court of Wings and Ruin★★★★★#3.5A Court of Frost and Starlight★★★★★First of all, let me just express my total devastation that an entire year of counting down the days until this book’s release isgonein two and a half hours of reading. I mean, I knew it was only going to be a novella, but… *sobs quietly*I didn’t expect it to go by THAT fast!This amazing little series has pulled me through some really dark times and brought so much joy into my life that I know I will treasure it, always. ♥Even now, with that bond again flowing between us like a river of star-flecked night, the echo of its vanishing lingered.ACOFAS definitely doesn’t read anything like the 3 main novels; the chapters switch perspectives occasionally, featuring POVs from Feyre, Rhysand, Cassian, and Morrigan. What struck me as particularly odd about this was the fact that Feyre and Rhysand’s chapters were in first-person, while Cassian and Morrigan’s were in third—a slightly jarring writing style, but nothing too detrimental.In his stare, I could have sworn galaxies swirled. In the shadows between his wings, the glorious depths of the night dwelled.We do get some really sweet and domestic Feysand moments, but I was actually surprised at how little time they actually spend together during the novella (and how little sex there is—who is this author and what did she do with Sarah?!). We did finally get the infamous wall scene! There are some incredibly sweet moments, at least a few scenes of Rhysand being his lovable cinnamon roll self, and a completely expected but adorable turn of events for their little family.Shadows different from anything my powers summoned, spoke to. Born in a lightless, airless prison meant to break him. Instead, he had learned its language.Feysand obsession aside, I loved how much time we got to spend with Cass and Az, learning more about their respective histories and how they’ve healed from the war. With Cassian’s perspectives especially, it felt like this was written to be a legitimate “bridge” between the ACOTAR series and whatever comes next, which I was honestly fond of, even if the next book’s focus on Cassian and Nesta does have me pretty nervous.Lucien had not come here to make amends during Solstice, I realized as Tamlin opened the door to the dark library. Lucien had come here out of pity. Mercy.Perhaps the most unexpected bits were the ones in which we visited Tamlin—with a novella this short, I honestly didn’t expect to see him at all, and certainly not in the state in which Rhysand found him. I never thought I would feel sorry for him, and I still think he’s a walking, talking garbage can, but I still couldn’t help being at least a little bit sad to see how far he’s fallen. I truly do hope that Sarah will write more about him in the future, because I can’t help but always feel that, no matter what a jerk he is, there’s something interesting about his potential as a character.Cassian set me down at last. “What’d you get me for Solstice?” I smacked his arm. “A heaping pile of shut the hell up.”Was ACOFAS everything I hoped and dreamed it would be? Honestly, no. This is more of a 4.5 rating, but you can believe that I did not hesitate to round up to 5 stars, because at the end of the day, I got to spend a few hundred pages with my precious bat babies, and watch this adorable little family interact and taunt and fuss and cry and laugh with one another, and that was all I reallyneededthis novella to offer me. I have missed the inner court so damn much since ACOWAR ended, and it just felt SO GOOD to fall right back into this world for a little bit longer. ♥Bonus list of tiny things that made me squeal:→ the sauna scene→ snowball fight traditions→ more “the power of art” scenes→ Morrigan reminiscing (ow, my heart)→ Amren’s newfound jigsaw puzzle obsession→ “Illyrian babies”→ Rhys cooking Tamlin dinner, like… what even?→ all the fuzzy scarves and winter holiday vibes→ Amren receiving a million pieces of jewelry as always→ Mor’s terrible taste in gifts→ SHAMELESS reference to Cass’ wingspanYou can find this review and more on myblog, or you can follow me ontwitter,bookstagram, orfacebook!'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Just published my latestBookTube Video- so excited to share it!!The Written Review*cue the undiluted screams of joy*Okay. Okay. I willtryto be objective about this one but I just finished ACOWAR and I am still riding that emotional high.To summarize:for a companion novel - not bad at all. It's full ofcotton-candy fluff,and I devoured every single bite.Now, this one was a bitheavy on the smutand a bit light on the Nessian but it definitely hadall the right feelsin all the right places.Stars flickered around us, sweet darkness sweeping in. As if we were the only souls in a galaxy.For those who don't know (and are curious) this novel sprang from avery drunk conversationbetween Sarah J. Maas (aka the Maaster) and her publisher.Maas confessed that in her free time that she wrote fanfiction of her work. Just little drabbles of what happened in between ACOWAR and her next novel. The publisher thought,we could sell that...And thus, this novel was born.So, keeping the origins in mind,I really liked this novel.There wasn't a big-bad or end-of-the-world subplot, not much plot development happened BUT this was afun and lightheartedread.And honestly, after ACOWAR, these charactersdeservea fewmonthsyears off from the doom-and-gloom.“Dangerous words, Rhysand,” Amren warned, strutting through the door, nearly swallowed up by the enormous white fur coat she wore. Only her chin-length dark hair and solid silver eyes were visible above the collar. She looked—“You look like an angry snowball,” Cassian said.Feyre and friends are spending theirfirst winter solstice(aka Christmas without Christ) together. And despite the warmth of the hearth, not all of the winter chill is kept out.Feyre frets aboutreuniting her family.Rhysand freaksout about what to buy her (Solstice and birthday presents!!).Mor isabsolutely terribleat expressing her feelings (and gift-giving in general).And Amren makes outlike a bandit(mostly cause everyone knows what to buy her - priceless jewels).And, of course,Nesta being Nestamade this novel shine.Every time she and Cassian are in the same room the dynamic between them is just perfect.He'd seen Nesta in that particular pose, too. He called it her I Will Slay My Enemies pose.Cassian had named about two dozen poses for Nesta at this point. Ranging from I Will Eat Your Eyes for Breakfast to I Don't Want Cassian to Know I'm Reading Smut. The latter was his particular favorite.I know this is just a companion novel and that there won't be much development in terms of relationships but c'mon Sarah J. Maas.Throw us a bone.(Actually, if you read the sneak peek at book 4 included at the end, I suppose she does offer us a bit of relationship hints).I am soemotionally investedin this series right now. I wish I could just time-machine myself into next year for book 4. But until I get that working, this companion novel will certainly tide me over.P.s. I got to read the hand-stamped version of Sarah J. Maas's book. All I could think of the whole time was -ohmygosh.

But if you read this just as an epilogue to the ACOTAR trilogy, it\'s just pointless and cringy fan service. If I have to read the words ""illyrian babies"" one more time it will actually induce vomiting.-----Original review, May 2018:we were all played like a violin in investing in this book. It’s $18 for lazy, messy fanfiction. This is 200+ pages of complete emptiness. There’s no purpose to any of this other than a money grab and longwinded, unnecessary epilogue to the original trilogy.This literally reads like someone from Tumblr wanted a scene with all the ACOTAR characters having christmas together so sarah whipped out her laptop. There was no substance or set-up to a new series at all. 90% of this book—and I wish I was kidding—is just the characters all going shopping for each other\'s presents--multiple times. The other 10% is Feyre and Rhys speaking in each other’s heads through the bond about how much they want to fuck each other. Additional scenes include the characters getting drunk every 30 pages, weird side POVs from characters who add nothing to the story, and a snowball fight between warriors. I honest to God am not joking when I say if I read this on fanfiction.net, I would laugh at it and say it’s unrealistic and poorly done. It’s just pure stupidity and vapid smut for the fans’ wish fulfillment.The writing in this is so messy. “Gentlemales” brought me to a depth of hell I haven’t seen before, so thanks for that, Sarah. Every time a female character says something “softly, but not weakly,” I feel like plunging a knife into my chest. Take a shot every time Sarah’s written that into one of her books. The sex scenes have so much potential to be steamy or whatever but Sarah ruins it by having the characters CONSTANTLY horny for each other, so it dampens any tension or angst. And the amount of times that sex is referenced in Rhys’s POV is utterly repulsive. At one point he justlooksat a table and is like “mmm I’d fuck Feyre on that” ... [john mulaney voice] FUCKING WHAT?? Even in Feyre’s POV when I could get away from his gross thoughts, he’d always talk shit to her down the bond and try and get in her pants or say something “sexy” but it’s just so corny and stupid and gross and it ruins the scene and I wanted to throw my book it was so irritating.I just think it’s funny how Feyre is the high lady and in Velaris, apparently women—oh, i’m sorry, FEMALES—are toootally equal to men *ahhem* males, and yet this entire book, Rhys is traveling to different courts and talking treaties and strategies with people and going off on business and Feyre does what? Cleans their home, goes shopping (no less than 4 times), cooks meals, and maybe if she’s feeling frisky, paints a little or has sex with her husband—oh, i’m sorry *ahhem*mate…. Sarah, don’t pretend that women are so equal to men but then literally only have female characters who love jewels and shopping and cooking and serving men and having sex. Even Amren didn’t slit a throat in this—she just complained about pooping and then had sex with Varian. Nesta and Lucien are the only vaguely interesting characters in this and I don’t like either of them. Their anger and distance made them more interesting than the characters in this getting shit-faced, making lame sexual jokes to each other, and referencing characters from the original trilogy I don’t care about.I wanted there to be something good about this because I genuinely loved ACOMAF and I’m waiting to feel a glimpse of the mastery that went into that book, but these new books just fan wish fulfillment at this point. This book was COMPLETELY unnecessary and the fact that Sarah is only extending the world to exploit the characters people like and get more money is just low. Let this series die, the world is done. The characters have exhausted their arcs and their humor is dumb and dry.Gave this book a star because Azriel deserves better than this bullshit.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Ok, it\'s time for an unpopular opinion. I\'m sure I\'ll get nasty-grammed all the way until next year for this but.....I didn\'t enjoy this. Not in the slightest.Granted, this is all opinion based; there\'s nothing inherently wrong with this book, I just found myself bored from beginning to end. In fact, I felt like the chapter excerpt for book #4 in the back had more to offer than this entire ""novella"" provided in 220+ pages. If you loved this one, I truly am happy for you, but I felt the need to provide some honest feedback in case there are others who may have the same expectations that I did here. I\'m going to keep this as spoiler free as possible, but if you haven\'t read the previous books in the series I would stop here.********************I\'m actually having trouble writing anything about the plot because nothing really happens in the story, aside from one decision that is made between Feyre and Rhysand. I did appreciate that the author was trying to offer a brief entrance back into the world she had created, and if this had been the beginning to a larger, 700+ page novel then I would have looked at this in a completely different light. I hate that I was expecting something to happen because it detracted from my ability to just enjoy being with these characters again as they shop for presents for each other and describe the food they are eating and recap everything we just read in the previous novel. But truly, if all you are looking for is atmosphere then you will likely enjoy this much more than I did. The descriptions of Velaris and the Illyrian war camps are breathtaking and exquisite.I did wholly appreciate the bit of backstory we get into Cassian initially, and my heart bled for Mor as she kept having to deal with her father and Eris and the Court of Nightmares, but every time I thought we were finally getting somewhere it would switch back over to shopping and food discussions. So I have to give credit to the fact that I was engaged in those moments, regardless of how the flow affected my absorption of the story. I was so disappointed in this disjointed lack of connection that I couldn\'t believe I was reading about the same inner circle I had once held so dear.Have I possible ""outgrown"" this series? I would hope not, because it\'s one of my favorite escapes, so I\'ve come to the conclusion that a big factor is this:I\'m tired of Feyre and Rhysand.It\'s not like I never want to hear about them, but I am so done with their narrative. It has come to the point where it feels repetitive and stale and dull and every single other character in this book, aside from a little bit of Cassian/Mor/Nesta was mostly left out. I wanted to hear more from all these other characters, from other courts spread across the continent, fromANYTHING BUT FEYRE AND RHYS.You know what I think the strongest point this novella has going for it?SJM actually made me feel a bit of conflicted sorrow for Tam Tam.I will never excuse abuse or the things he did wrong previously, but she managed to touch a tiny place inside my heart that wished for more for ole Tammy, that he could find someone to accept his brokenness and help heal him into a functioning member of fae society.I\'m sorry as I\'m completely aware that this review is just a bundle of disjointed thoughts (how\'s that for irony?), but it\'s the best I could do under the circumstances. Guys, I\'ll still read the next book, as I\'m interested in the Nesta/Cassian deal, but I sincerely hope that we see more Elain/Lucien/Azriel, because I missed my precious babies. I really did.Ok, NOW you can throw your pitchforks and knives at me, I\'m done!;)'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Rereading this again filled me up with all kinds of warmth and goodness. I adore this family.——————————That motherfuckin wall scene!I mean, what are words at this point when it comes to Sarah J Maas's books?! She's my favourite author. Her books have brought about this sense of utter calm and happiness within me every time I read and think about them.This novella was everything we needed to potentially see the direction the other books will go in. And boy, am I beyond excited for it!I'm sure we'll be getting more of Cassian and Nesta in the next book and Sarah J Maas does character development ridiculously well and my god, being able to look forward and dream about their character exploration makes me too excited for words.I loved that we got see more of the Inner Circle. They are, hands down, my favourite bunch of fictional characters. I feel like I'm part of the family. I'm so glad some lighthearted, happy and sweet, tender moments were included in this. The family aspect between them all felt too real, and so good to read. And so worthy of them to have after the events of ACOWAR.And the emphasis on art in this book and seeing Feyre getting back into it as a form of healing for herself and others was a dream. Her dreams were finally actualised.The progression from ACOWAR to this felt natural and the cities and its people (including our main lot) were still healing, still too traumatised from the war. But progress was being made and I can't wait to see how that will be looked at in the upcoming spin-off series.I think at this point people are more interested in the progression of other characters. I'm here for it, but I don't ever see myself tiring of Feyre and Rhys and the bond between them! Chapter 22 is all I'm going to say.

I know many people weren\'t happy about getting another book about them but they still hold a special place in my heart soa new whole canon book about them?It felt like Christmas morning for me lol.Besides that, from my point of view the book is more aboutseeing the inner circle heal after the warthan feysand. Some dealt with it better than others but everyone has its own scars.I loved seeingthe progression of Feyre and Rhysand\'s relationship,they\'re my all time favorite fictional couple and seeing them happy and making plans for the future was amazing, after everything they went through they deserve it and no one can convince me otherwise. Plus, it was good to seeold Rhyscoming back, he was kind of less funny and flirty in acowar (understandably).It\'s true,the plot was basically non existent but I mean ... uhm what were you expecting?I lost count of how many times Sarah said the whole book\'s purpose was giving a deserved ending to the feysand arc and creating a bridge between the two series. That\'s exactly what she did so I don\'t get the amount of hate I\'m reading about this topic.Plus, the final excerpt confirmed thatthe next book is gonna be nessian\'sand I liked how Sarah set up the two of them (especially Nesta, her story arc in acofas is soooo dark).

EXPLICIT SEX SCENES of heroine with both love interests: winner RhysandBook 3: NO LOVE TRIANGLE!Feyre and Rhys remain together, but there are other love triangles around and Rhys proposes a Male-Male-Female threesome to Feyre. Maybe he was joking, either way her reaction was unnecessarily enthusiastic for a woman who has already been sexually involved with 3 different men in the series and who is basically a newlywed. FeyRhys is still in their honeymoon period so why are they already joking about threesomes?♣ IF YOU DON\'T LIKE ABUSIVE LOVE INTERESTS AND ABUSIVE WOMEN-Tamlin love interest of book 1? ABUSIVE!-Rhys, secondary love interest of book 1 andprimary love interest of books 2 and 3? Rhys tortured the heroine(there was a reason, though)ABUSIVE!- The sisters? Everyone talks about how Tamlin should apologize. When will the sisters apologize?Feyre\'s elder sisters let Feyre hunt for the family from a very early age, but they were always there reaping the benefits of Feyre\'s effort. When Feyre was going through an abusive relationship they kept receiving money from Feyre\'s abuser and didn\'t bother to find out how she wasABUSIVE!♣IF YOU DON\'T LIKE WHEN sexual assault victims ARE THROWN UNDER THE BUS TO MOVE THE PLOT FORWARD. CAREFUL WITH DANGEROUS RAPE MESSAGESIt happens so much on New adult and adult literature (game of thrones, the girl with the dragon tatoo, the second book of the outlander series) a sexual assault victim gets the ""oh-you-were-raped?- don\'t- bitch- about- it- and- move- forward treatment. So many books trivialize the worst aspect of PTSD and sexual assault and try to ""sovle it"" either with revenge or the magic romantic relationship that will make everything go away. Or the experiences just get ignored and brush aside! This happens to Mor, a secondary character in the 3rd book who is a rape survivor whenshe\'s forced to work along with her attacker and the one who puts her through that was the hero of the story!To be fair, I can understand the circumstances, doesn\'t mean I have to like that kind of story line, especially when that\'s something that good editing could have taken care of. That kind of disrespect for rape was unneccessary IMO. It didn\'t move the plot forward and it\'s out of character for Rhys to act like that. I love Rhys and didn\'t like the way SJM made him act.♣ IF YOU BELIEVE ANY BOOK YOU PAY FOR SHOULD BE PROFESSIONALLY EDITEDI\'m not a grammar nazi and my spelling is terrible, but I can tell you, even some fanfiction I\'ve read has a more polished editing than this book. There\'s the overuse of words like mate. There are also problems with pace, repetitiveness, flow and consistency of the voices when changing from a narrator to the other and from a first person POV to a 3rd person POV. The characters sound too modern. The worldbuilding is not high fantasy at all. The setting of this series is pretty much like a modern series. All these are things that a content editor and a proofreader could have taken care off, but the publishers rushed publication lowering the quality of the editing and the writing. Even so they are selling this at full ebook price.My ratings for the series so far♣A Court of Thorns and Roses ACOTAR 3/5because abusive relationships, false advertising (it\'s new adult dishonestly marketed as young adult) and love triangle. My review is currently censored and hidden from the third page of review. It should appear somewhere between page 2 and 3.♣A COURT OF MIST AND FURY ACOMAF4/5 because I didn\'t appreciate the explicit sex scene with OM, but I highly recommend this book to my friends who don\'t mind safety issues and like explicit scenes in slow-burn-romance. This book is EROTICA (according to the goodreads description of the genre) marketed as YA.♣A COURT OF WINGS AND RUIN ACOWAR2.5/5 because poor editing, f bombs, repetitiveness, unnecessary sex scenes and dangerous messages. No, glorifying revenge and abusive women isn\'t female empowerment. No, in most marriage it isn\'t always the woman\'s choice, it\'s always the choice of both of them. My review is currently censored by goodreads.Sources of my pictures:AMAZON CANADA CHILDREN\'S BOOKS ADVENTUREAMAZON CANADA CHILDREN\'S BOOKS FANTASYAMAZON AUSTRALIA CHILDREN\'S BOOKS LOVEBooktopia A COURT OF MIST AND FURY RECOMMENDED AGESEROTICA GENRE DEFINITION ACCORDING TO GOODREADSACOMAF RECOMMENDED TO CHILDREN 11-13 on audibleWHY YOU SHOULDN\'T TRUST BOOKTUBERS AND THE YA GOODREADS CHOICE AWARDS REGARDNG THE CONTENT OF THIS BOOK?Because a vast majority of booktubers have failed so far to mention that this book series contains erotic/explicit content in their booktube reviews even though they always discuss ""young adult books"". It could be unintentionally. It could be intentionally. The reason doesn\'t matter. They\'re contributing to the false advertising.A fewbooktubers are being published or aspire to be published by the same IMPRINT of this new adult series. Others booktubers and bookbloggers seem to want good relationships with the publishing industry. They won\'t say anything that can hurt the marketing agenda of the big publishing houses.Note: Bookables, Benji Alderson and Polandbananas have mentioned this series is new adult , so of course a lot of booktubers are somehow honest, it\'s not cool calling out an entire community of readers because the dishonesty of a few bad apples. Distrust only the reviewers who call this series young adult.On the other hand, The Goodreads choice awards editors ignored the shelving system when they selected the categories for the goodreads choice awards last year. In the goodreads feedback group they told me that\'s how editors select categories: based on shelving.At the time of the awards this series was shelved primarily asfantasy and romanceby GR users, but still the editors made it compete on the young adult category. Not in romance (second most-shelved genre), not in fantasy (first most-shelved genre). They made it compete in young adult (third most-shelved genre followed closely by New adult)This review isn\'t meant to discouraging people from reading/buying the book. On the contrary. I\'m inviting you to read this series if you don\'t have problems with sexual content and abusive relationships.Despite all the problems I have with the false advertising I enjoyed the trilogy. But again I\'m warning you:♣ NEVER trust the information that you see on Goodreads, Common sense media. and booktube. Not all reviewers are independent and unbiased. Do your research.Life is too short and TBR piles are too big to just ignore the kind of information that can help us decide what we will read next. Goodreads shouldn\'t try to hide that information.People who pay $15-18 for a hardcover and $8-15 for an ebook of a young adult ""high fantas"" book have every right to expect:♣ 12-18 YO Main characters,♣ no F bombs♣ no explicit sex.♣ A profesionally edited book.That\'s not what any book of this series delivers.Update 02-24People aren\'t expecting something like this:For a series that is supposedly about women\'s choices,when Goodreads, Booktubers and Publishers hide this information from young girls they are taking away their right to decide when or if they would read erotic content. Not to mention they\'re contributing to the book being sold in the Children\'s section of multiple retailers.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""the snowball fight?? The solstice gifts??

This is the equivalent of a fluffy fanfic with no plot. Honestly, the plot of this series wasn\'t great in the first place, so ACOFAS is basically what happens when SJM makes the good decision to scrap the plot and just focus on the part I actually care about - the characters.This novella is infamous for, uh...My reviews are rated G, thank you very much.Let\'s just say... stuff happened in the sky.I had nearly sent us crashing into the rooftops like an Illyrian whelp.If you listen carefully, you can hear my wheezing.But that\'s not the main problem I had with this, even though it was, well - a littlestrange.I hate the treatment of Tamlin.I hate it so much.In case you somehow have no idea what Tamlin did in ACOMAF, here\'s a summary.He locked Feyre in the house and emotionally abused her. It was bad.But Rhys was such a jerk about it when it wasFeyre\'sresponsibility to talk to him.Rhys just assumed that what he said was what Feyre wanted. He was needlessly cruel to someone who was suffering from PTSD.Tamlin\'s mental illness doesn\'t give him an excuse, obviously, but I\'m still angry that Tamlin didn\'t get the help he needed. He was traumatized, scarred; but everyone focused on Feyre, leaving him to become the person he is now - broken, depressed, scared. Believing he is only worthy of hate.Look at how jerky Rhys the Beast is being literally after Tamlin saved his life:No, Tamlin deserved what he\'d brought upon himself, this husk of a life. He deserved every empty room, every snarl of thorns, every meal he had to hunt for himself.That makes me sad. That actually makes me physically upset. No one deserves that. No one. And it\'s not even Rhys\'s place to say this stuff to Tamlin:""You deserve everything that has befallen you. You deserve this pathetic, empty house, your ravaged lands. I don\'t care if you offered that kernel of life to save me, I don\'t care if you still love my mate. I don\'t care that you saved her from Hybern, or a thousand enemies before that.I hope you live the rest of your miserable life alone here.""WHOA.CALM DOWN.Look at how depressed poor Tammy is:Tamlin didn\'t have shields around the house. None to prevent anyone from winnowing in, to guard against enemies appearing in his bedroom and slitting his throat.It was almost as if he was waiting for someone to do it.Let\'s be clear - I don\'t like Tamlin. He\'s a manipulative jerk. But he needs help. He clearly needs someone to take care of him like Rhys did for Feyre in ACOMAF. And he was not given that, so everyone hates him because of it.This also ruined Lucien\'s life. Now he\'s not welcome anywhere. And he says it like it is:""You can be as much of an asshole as that mate of yours, you know that?""I mean, he\'s not wrong.My other big complaint with this novella is the random ""feminist"" stuff that\'s thrown in so awkwardly? We get it, males can cook and clean. It\'s not that revolutionary. It should have been incorporated better into the story, rather than stated outright....cooking, cleaning, child-rearing, clothes-making... There was honor in such tasks - pride and good work to be found in them. But not when every single one of the females here was expected to do it... Traditions going back thousands of years, left mostly unchallenged.Until us. Until now.Rhysand is such a Feminist King™I appreciate what this is trying to do, but it\'s so cheesy that... I really can\'t, I\'m sorry.""The boys can help decorate, clean, and cook. They\'ve got two hands.""Wow, Cassian\'s a Feminist King™ too.Added to the random tragic backstories that strangers confessed to Feyre at the oddest times, this novella felt rather weak.Oh, yes, they wererandomall right.""My husband didn\'t return from the war.""Miss Girl, Feyre does not know you.Oh, and here was an absolutely stunning analogy that just... shook me to the core.This same random weaver person had a tapestry and she explained that the black thread was called the Void and that the white thread was called Hope. And then...""If I were to stop, if I were to let this loom or the spindle go silent... Then there would be no Hope shining in the Void.""Wow, so the Hope thread symbolizes hope and the Void thread symbolizes emptiness!!!Speaking of on-the-nose, Feyre has a weird relationship with money. As she reminds us, over and over and over again:The sums we allocated were sizable, more money than I\'d ever dreamed of possessing.This would be okay if it were only said once. But no.It didn\'t feel real, those numbers and figures. Like it was children\'s play money. I only bought what I needed.She says this so. many. times. Basically every time she buys something.Decadent - it felt decadent, and selfish, to shop.I didn\'t like how the side characters developed (besides Nesta, her trauma was just haunting). No one forgives Nesta for making Feyre hunt before Prythian, and yet everyone forgives Elain when she did the same thing. It doesn\'t make sense. There\'s no explanation.""You still can barely talk to Nesta,"" I said. ""Yet Elain you can talk to nicely.""""Elain is Elain.""""If you blame one, you have to blame the other.""""No, I don\'t. Elain is Elain.""What kind of explanation is that? ""Elain is Elain."" And? Are we supposed to forgiveherinstead of Nesta because she\'s so gentle and kind and sweet and blah blah blah? I don\'t think so.My theory is that Elain is not actually nice. She only speaks maybe 2-5 times during this novella, and most of the time, she\'s speaking coldly. Everyone is surprised, but... This is just how she is. She takes advantage of her family and friends thinking she\'s weak and needs protecting. But she\'s actually just a colder person than Nesta.Elain\'s voice was colder than usual.I\'d never heard Elain\'s voice so cold.Also, what is Feyre painting? No one knows. This entire novella is about her painting and I literally still don\'t know what she\'s painting.""What sort of things do you paint?""""The things that need telling.""How very descriptive.I painted and painted and painted.I painted until my back cramped... I\'d known what needed to come out of me the moment I perched on the rickety stool...But it began to emerge. Began to take form.I lowered my brush and stared at what I\'d created.Me.Or how I\'d been in the Ouroboros, that beast of scale and claw and darkness; rage and joy and cold. All of me. What lurked beneath my skin.But...But what is it??I painted through the grief that lingered at the weaver\'s story, painted for her loss. I painted all that rose within me, letting the past bleed onto the canvas, a blessed relief with each stroke of my brush.I still don\'t know.I hadn\'t any idea what to get them, other than this. The [paintings] I\'d worked on recently - glimpses of their stories. None of them explained what the paintings meant, what they beheld.Imagine knowing what Feyre is painting.For on that painting I\'d shown him what I had not revealed to anyone. The creature inside myself, the creature full of hate and regret and love and sacrifice, the creature that could be cruel and brave, sorrowful and joyous.I\'ll leave you with that mystery to figure out. If anyone knows what Feyre\'s painting, tell me and I will thank you profusely.1.5 stars; the word ""mate"" was used 71 times. this is not Australia, thank you'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3/5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️“Stars flickered around us, sweet darkness sweeping in. As if we were the only souls in a galaxy.”I\'m sorry. I\'m so fucking sorry.THIS BOOK FUCKING KILLED ME WITH BOREDOM. I swear to God, I\'m dead now. My ghost is writing this review. I\'m fucking dead because this book had no point in even existing. This book isn\'t even filler. It\'s nothing. I can\'t even describe it. This book was SUPPOSED to be the bridge between the old series and the new series. But like??? This book was just messy archiveofourown.org fanfiction. And not a good one. Not one I would give kudos to or write a comment under. One I wouldn\'t read at all. But now let\'s go to the summary of the book, which is also inadequate.Feyre, Rhys, and their close-knit circle of friends are still busy rebuilding the Night Court and the vastly-changed world beyond. But Winter Solstice is finally near, and with it, a hard-earned reprieve.Yet even the festive atmosphere can\'t keep the shadows of the past from looming. As Feyre navigates her first Winter Solstice as High Lady, she finds that those dearest to her have more wounds than she anticipated--scars that will have far-reaching impact on the future of their Court.See? Even the summary has nothing to prepare us for. As you all know, because I\'ve been raving and raving about those books for a million years, this is the series which has reintroduced me to fantasy. This series holds a very special place in my heart and I have come to loveSarah J. Maasas an author, too. This book was unlike anything she has written. This book was clearly a money grab, fanservice sort of fanfiction book. Which added almost nothing to this series. Everything that happened in this book could be included in a 30 page snippet at the beginning of the fourth book of the series, and it would all be ok. But let\'s talk specifics.The plotLet\'s talk about the non-existentPLOT. This book was: shopping with Feyre, shopping with Mor, cooking with Elain, hardcore negotiations with Rhys, Az and Cassian, some good ol\' fucking with good ol\' Feyre and Rhys, and then again shopping, and then again some fucking, and some tension featuring Nesta,ARTwith Feyre, brooding with Tamlin, sexual tension with Cassian and Nesta, and let\'s not forget the epic new single....MATES, included in the new album byFeyre ArcheronandRhysand(who still doesn\'t have a surname)M.A.T.E.S.(masturbation anal testicles ejaculation sex) (wtf was that). Let\'s be real here. Every time I read this fucking word I want to off myself. This word is ruined for me. I can never hear a dudebro call another dudebro ""mate"" and not remember this. Let this word rest. Let this word die. Let this word becomeFrost and Starlight(see what I did there). JUST LET THIS WORD GO. WE KNOW THEY\'RE MATES THEY\'RE MATED FOR LIFE THEY\'LL BE TOGETHER FOREVER AND FOREVER NAH NAH NAH. Ugh. If I had one euro (yes I\'m changing it from ""if I had a dollar"" if I had a fucking dollar I couldn\'t use it for anything) for every time the word ""mate"" is in this book, I would go to vacation to Santorini. It\'s expensive guys. You have no fucking clue how much.The POVsThis book added multiple perspectives of characters, which I found pretty interesting, but also unnecessary because nothing happens in this book and we don\'t need to see that nothing explained from multiple people, but you know, it happens. It confused me, though. We mostly see Feyre\'s and Rhys\'s POVs, in first person, and then we see some more characters\' POVs like Cassian and Mor but... in third person. Which is really unsettling and baffling. And those chapters are such heartwreching and heartbreaking moments from their past, and in this book, it feels our of place. A book about the Winter Solstice which is basically Christmas, shopping, gifts exchanging, happy times, scenes like these seem unnecessary. I couldn\'t take them seriously, and I wanted to. Also, it seems like we\'re gonna get the next series with third person narration. Which is fine by me, but what\'s the point?The romanceI\'m not a big fan of established and domestic relationships. Feyre and Rhysand literally murdered me in ACOMAF. The sexual tension, the eye fucking, the actual fucking, the ""things"" before the actual fucking, they made my little shipper heart die with happiness. And then... they became so canon, it hurts my soul. They don\'t interest me anymore. It\'s all sex and fucking and ""oh mate, my mate"" and ""oh how much I love you my Feyre"" and sky sex which was disturbing and like??? People can see you dude! You can fucking winnow and fly, just get her on a bed, or a wall (lol) or a sink or whatever floats your boat. I believe these characters\'s circle is over now. I\'m truly excited for them to have a child but I guess we\'ll see everything from another people\'s POVs now. It\'s time now forCASSIAN AND NESTA. Oh man, how much I ship this. I\'m so fucking board for this. They are my new Feyre and Rhys. I want this to happen so badly, I want to scream. Nesta pissed me off a lot in this book, but I will handle her for this ship. And because Cassian obviously loves her and I love Cassian with my entire soul. Furthermore, I don\'t know what to do with Elain, in terms of shipping. Az and Elain are cute af but I kinda want to explore the whole Elain and Lucien factor. Elain pisses me off, but I love Az and Lucien and I want to see them happy.TamlinThis book made Tamlin an unnecessary villain. It\'s like this book didn\'t have a plot or anything or someone to blame shit on so just blame it all on Tamlin. Don\'t get me wrong, I fucking hate his guts. I appreciated what he did in ACOWAR, he kinda redeemed himself, but I still don\'t like him. Nonetheless, there is no point in what\'s happening to him. Everyone is casting him out. He doesn\'t have any friends, his home is a graveyard, his people hate him. And you know, he isn\'t the worst. We\'ve seen worst villains redeem themselves. He\'s just a controlling and manipulative asshole who can\'t control his temper. He didn\'t hurt Feyre or Rhys. I want to see what will happen to his character, but Sarah has villainized him too much.The humorThis book was funny af. Hence my rating. The Amren peeing scene, the sauna scene, the ""Illyrian babies"" scene, the painting Rhys nude scene, the Feyre and Cassian drunkly decorating scene, the gifts exchange scene. It was all hilarious and fluffy and happy and it\'s something I needed. I have come to love these characters so much and I feel their inner circle as my home. I was truly happy to see them domestic and healing their wounds after the war. But, nonetheless, there was not a book needed for this. All these scenes could have been included in the fourth book. But, you know, money is important.Basically, this book was a character driven tease which gave us nothing! Honestly, we see things beginning and then we are given NOTHING. I want to know, I want to know everything. This book was diverse to anything Sarah has ever written. I was expecting this BOOM to happen but nothing. A big huge pile of shit and nothing. The book fourth snippet at the end was the most interesting part of this book. We kinda see what the next series is gonna be about. But still, not ENOUGH. Honestly, people, don\'t pay money for this book. It was too expensive for its size and importance. This is why I never read novellas and extra books to series. They mostly add nothing to the story. ANYWAY, till the next book in the A Court of Thorns and Roses series, which will be late af, K BYE!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is a great catch with the main heroes of the series. The last book was an all-out epic. This one, though a lot shorter, is still filed with SJM’s great storytelling and character development.So far, I have seen all these characters in the worst possible situations and facing incredible odds. Making great sacrifices and the legendary lengths they would go through to achieve their goals and protect those they love. Now, when they have “won”, the work of rebuilding, forgiveness, and moving on from the losses suffered.Yes there is no where near as much action in this book, and the characters are not moved along as much as I would have wanted but the are definitely important issues uncovered her that need to be explored later. This is more of “wet the appetite” for the next huge chapter, but almost as importantly a much need to assess where the characters are right now in themselves and to each other.Though Feyre and Rhysand embrace their fate together. Others rebel against a fate they have not chosen with their very souls. These are the first steps in building a new world. A great point to catch up with everyone as they set their path for the future, to forget their past, or simply (stubbornly) deny fates chosen path.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'First, technically speaking, why was this book necessary? What was the plot?Was thereeven a plot? SJM said this novella is a bridge between Feysand’s story and the next story in this world, but what exactly did it bridge?All I got from this book is anger and a gag reflex.If you’ve seen my ratings, updates, or followed me at all on here, you know I wasobsessedwith ACOMAF. It was all I talked about for about a year, from the moment I read it.I basically hated the other two books, but I loved the second one, and got so attached to feysand.But, good god, it is justnot possiblethat the person who wrote ACOMAF is the same one who wrote ACOWAR&ACOFAS. (Yes I’m hinting at a conspiracy theory).Like, ACOWAR was bad, but I still had some attachments to Feysand, even though Rhys was kind of a douche even then.But this? This wasbad.let me just saythis book is not a fantasy book. It’s a contemporary set in a different world. no fantastic elements other than flying (and even that was only mentioned for the purpose of a sex scene) were present in this book.Feyre didn’t use her powers even once. You’d think she’d use this time to practice and perfect her abilities, but no. She might as well be human.Butwhat annoyed me most about this book (and ACOWAR too tbh) is the complete regression of the characters.Feyre went back to roaming around the house doing nothing all day, Mor isstillhiding herself for no apparent reason— homophobia is not even a thing in this world and even if it were we all know the Inner Circle would accept her no matter what, so what’s the point?, Nesta went back to her old self (though I kind of get that), Amren lost all her strength and fierceness and just sits around doing jigsaw puzzles, and Rhys, oh god, Rhys. HOW IN THE WORLD is this sleazy, sex crazed douchebag supposed to be the same loving, caring, supportive Rhysand from ACOMAF? He couldn’t gotwo sentenceswithout making some unnecessary innuendos, talking about how good Feyre feels, how he can’t stand being around her without fucking her or how he dicked her in the sky while flying (???).His entire first chapter in this was him sulking and whining because he doesn’t get to fuck Feyre daily.*insert the world’s smallest violin*But putting that aside, let’s talk about how “”feminist”” he is.(I just wanna note that I know I still loved Rhys (less, but still loved him) after ACOWAR even though all those issues were present there too. It was just a little more subtle and I was still on that Feysand rush since I’d read ACOMAF only a month before. Now enough time has passed and ACOFAS has really solidified Rhys’ problematic behavior in my mind and I can see it for what it truly is.)In ACOMAF, he said [about Feyre]”My equal in every way; she would wear my crown, sit on a throne beside mine.Never sidelined, never designated to breeding and parties and child-rearing.My queen.”(page 621).And what do you know, in ACOFAS she isconstantlysidelined,andtrying for a child.In fact, the beginning of this bookreallyparallels the beginning of ACOMAF. I mean, yeah, Feyre’s in a better mental state for sure, but she still sits around the house being bored, or painting, or designing a house, while Rhysand is out there dealing with all the politics. Direct quotes from the book-”perhaps I’d use the day to organize things. Find room for everything.““High Lady of the Night Court, Defender of the Rainbow and the … Desk.”[Rhys walks in while Feyre’s in bed] “Right where I left you”... “Isn’t it all I’m good for?”Like, are you fucking kidding me? Yeah, you crowned her High Lady, but the reality is that you never involve her in anything big. You just have her clean and do some paperwork. She’s a housewife. That’ssoooofeminist of you! High Lord of the Feminist Court!Basically,Sarah J Maas made Rhys such a supporter of women in ACOMAF to make the difference between Tamlin and him even clearer, and once we all switched to Rhys’ side she figured she could just drop the act.Well, I got some news for you Sarah. It doesn’t work that way. Your readers aren’t dumb.And also, can we talk about the whole period thing? It was really cool to see such an open discussion about it in a book (no sarcasm this time) but... the idea that it makes women completely incompetent? Not so much. And that cheesy scene of him stroking her hair while she’s in pain? I almost puked.Oh and for god’s sake don’t get me started on the sisters!!!First of all- Leave! Nesta! Alone!She’s been traumatized, and she doesn’t wanna be around the Inner Circle because it’s a constant reminder of what she’d gone through. Feyre of all people should know what that feels like. But no, she keeps pressuring her and practically blackmailing her so she would come.And Cassian chasing her down her street even though she asked him to leave her alone multiple times.These people can’t respect a woman’s simple request for privacy. but hey, they have a High Lady! Yay Feminism!And I am just disgusted by how Elain is treated in this book.She is constantly pressured by Feyre to give Lucien a chance even though she repeatedly and explicitly says she’s not interested. But Feyre doesn’t let up because he’s a “good male”.Again, Feyre is such a feminist Icon!Not to mention how much Elain is belittled and ridiculed in this. She may be naive, but she’s not dumb! she’s not a child! They all (excluding Azriel, the only pure soul in this mess) keep treating and speaking to her like she’s a four year old!!!I have more thoughts but I’m so angry that I can’t even make them into a coherent sentence and this is getting too long anyway, so the bottom line is, I only care about Azriel now, but even if there’s a book about him, count me out because I’m done. I’m just done with Sarah J. Maas books.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3.5 StarsSo...I\'m not in a reviewing mood at ALL; but I figured I better lay something down here before I completely forget any thoughts I have about this book and my experience reading it.I had a hard time rating this.Because, well, it just didn\'t blow my mind.That said.While I didn\'t love it...While I didn\'t really, really, reallylikeit per se...I didappreciateit.And here\'s why.Prior to receiving my copy in the mail and, obviously, reading the book, I received Maas\' subscriber newsletter email. In it she had the usual ""woo hoo, it\'s release day"" fodder they all send out, but it also contained - what I would later discover upon finishing the book - was exactly what was depicted in the ""Acknowledgements"" section.In it, she talked about the process of writing this book and how hard it was because, in the midst of it, her father had a major health scare and almost died. Still, despite this trying time - she also found out she was pregnant - and, despite not really always ""feelin\' it,"" Maas trudged through the writing process because DEADLINE.As someone who loves to write and also lost a parent in the past, I just really empathized with the creative struggle Maas probably had here.Now, am I saying that an author\'s personal life issues should be taken into account when rating/reviewing or considering your own enjoyment of a book?Hell no.Of course not.Absolutely not.I\'m just saying that, FOR ME, reading about that just changed the mindset I started the book with.I went in knowing that, by her own admission, Maas struggled writing it.So I guess you could say that 1) lowered my expectations bar, and 2) made me read the book knowing Maas had been experiencing personal pain while writing it.And I think that emotion was definitely captured in the story.This book will NOT blow your mind.It does NOT really move the plot forward.But what it did do, in my opinion, was move the CHARACTERS forward.It really drilled down into a lot of their inner thoughts and longstanding issues and baggage and - as someone who loves character driven stories - I really enjoyed that aspect of the book.Also, I mentioned this in a status update while reading, but for some reason, I am REALLY intrigued by Nesta\'s character.She was totally selfish in book one and has continued to be heinously bitchy throughout the series, but there is just something about her strength, stubbornness, and just plain fucking resolve that I love. For whatever reason, I am just sometimes drawn to complex, fucked up, misunderstood female characters that everyone else hates. And I can\'t WAIT for the next book.In fact, I think the character development done in this book is going to act as a veritable buttress to the next books in the series and make them even better for its existence, as meh as it might have been plot/action-wise.So yeah, I guess I had more to say than I thought. LOL Oh well.Toodles!P.S. I thought I\'d share the cool exclusive edition ends papers for anyone who hasn\'t seen them...'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""edit 2/21: still a waste of time but felt like i needed a refresh before ACOSF... prolly didn’t need to bother but it wasn’t that awful-------------------------------------and to think, i was so excited for this onednf @ like page 50. this just wasn't good & when i saw the second novella was announced my eyes rolled back in my head so far i saw fucking stars. i'll give you some unneeded backstory since i don't have much to say about content:i started this series before i started reviewing on goodreads. i devoured the first 2 books back to back in college and was pretty in love. at the time, i hadn't been reading hardly anything because college but after reading the first 2 i got back into reading and back into fantasy. so i will always be grateful for that, but i also think that colored my judgment of the series.when you've never had chocolate before, a hersheys bar tastes pretty fcking good. and when you haven't read fantasy in a while, SJM books seem pretty goodthese books really aren't that bad but they aren't really that good either. and SJM's bloated continuation of series is kind of getting on my last nerve. no one wanted 2 novellas. no one really wanted this series to continue beyond the first 3 books. sure we love the gang but could you just start a new series? your pregnancy shouldn't be an excuse for a shitty novella.i'm rambling. whatever. i'm selling this book.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Nothing happened in this I love it though'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '❄ DASHING THROUGH PRYTHIAN ❄❄ ON TAMLIN\'S FUCKING FACE ❄❄ OVER THE HILLS THEY GO ❄❄FUCKINGALL THE WAY ❄no kidding❄ FEYRE\'S BOUT TO STRIP ❄❄ MAKING HYBERN SHINE ❄❄ OH WHAT FUN IS TO WEEP AND CRINGE ❄❄ AT SARAH\'S CHEEZY LINES ❄❄ JINGLE BELLS ❄❄ CAULDRON YELLS: ""OH BOY, THIS WAS LAME"" ❄❄CHRISTMASSOLSTICE SHOPPING ❄❄ & FEYSAND SMUTTING ❄❄BUT NESTA SAVES THE DAY!!! ❄'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Real Rating: 2.5This book made me realize that I am more interested in the characters that are not in the inner circle like Lucien, Tamlin, Viviane, Kallias and even Eris (I’m really intrigued by him). Anytime those people were mentioned, my interest in the book rose. Unfortunately, since they are indeed not part of the inner circle, their presence in this was either non-existent or minuscule.This book was said to bridge the gap between what happened in previous books and the next ones. I somewhat agree that there is a sense of direction as to what the next book is going to be about but most of what happened in this had no bearing on that. Honestly, I believe this novella wasn’t necessary and SJM should have written a full book. This book had so many unnecessary fillers.What to expect- Feyre shopping- Feyre and Rhysand having dirty thoughts about themselves all the time/doing dirty things to themselves. The sex scenes/thoughts in this series used to give me anxiety because I did not want to read about that but in this, it was just annoying and old- Feyre painting- Feyre being sad that she was rich- Rhysand being ‘perfect’- To mix things up: Illyrian drama, Tamlin being sad, Nesta being annoying.Things I liked- My kind, loyal Lucien: I loved reading about him (mostly from other people talking about him) and I loved his brief appearance.- I liked reading about Tamlin even though it was mostly depressing. I have a feeling his situation is going to change soon.- I think among the inner circle, Azriel is my favourite and I loved reading about him. I’m curious about his shadows.- I like Eris… I don’t know why, I tried not to but I can’t help it. I think there is more to him than meets the eye.- I liked Feyre when she was not with/thinking about Rhysand. She’s actually a really nice and caring person.Now to get to some details- I know ACOTAR was beauty and the beast retelling but Tamlin in this gave me 'pre-belle' beast vibe with how lonely and depressing him and his court is. So hopefully, his belle would come soon 💕- I honestly don’t think Feyre did that much damage in the spring court to warrant the current state- I used the ship Nesta with Cassian like most people do but while reading this, I realized that I only shipped them because of the tension they have together. I used to like Nesta because I found her intriguing but she was so annoying in this and I honestly don’t know why Cassian still likes her. He deserves better and I honestly started shipping him with that girl at the shop smh- I also used to Ship Elain with Lucien but she’s so rude to him. No one is saying you have to be with him but at least be nice. He also deserves better- I don’t ship Azriel with Elain because their relationship gives me family vibe and not romantic. Especially with the comment about his mother- I still can’t believe Mor hasn’t told Azriel the truth..Until she does that, I don’t think I can like her.- I’m tired of being sad for Lucien. I really hope in the next books, we see him being happyOverall, if you’re a Feysand fan, you’ll probably really like this but I’m not so it was eh.This book wasn't worth my excitement and not just because Lucien was there for like 2 pagesP.Sare we ever going to know how rhysand became the most powerful high lord in history? or at least how that was provenPre-readingThis comes in exactly 2 weeks.

When Tricia finds her secret tapes of her sessions, she starts listening to get to the bottom of the doctor\'s disappearance.MY OPINIONBUCKLE TF UP. THIS IS ABOUT TO BE A LONG ONE.Where to start, where to start? Ok let\'s do the writing. I truly believe there are sixth graders who can write more compelling sentences. Here\'s an excerpt that nearly gave me an aneurysm:But my attention goes back to that white cashmere sweater I had been slobbering over last night. I love cashmere. I mean, everyone does. What sort of freak doesn’t like cashmere? And the sweater is so white. Like unblemished snow. I grab the sweater and pull it off the hanger. I throw it over my head, almost groaning in ecstasy at how nice the fabric feels against my skin. I love cashmere.I wish I was joking. Yep, she writes ""I love cashmere"" twice in a matter of sentences. I was almost hoping the cashmere was going to be laced with some kind of toxin that would kill Tricia and her four brain cells just so something interesting could happen, but nah, homegirl just looooooOOOOves cashmere.Then we have the aggressive spoon-feeding. I felt like I was being choked to death with the flashing neon sign foreshadowing that Freida deployed. Here\'s a sample:I don’t know why my friends don’t like him. Whenever we talk about him, they always say, this is a red flag, or that’s a red flag. But Ethan is a genuinely good guy. What does it matter that he hasn’t had many girlfriends before me? And why should the fact that he lost his parents and doesn’t have much family be a reason I should avoid him?The author repeats this train of thought so many times that even Ray Charles could see what was coming.Next, we have the ""click baity writing"" where the author mentions a secret (in this case, many, many times) but won\'t reveal the secret until much later in a lazy attempt to create suspense. See:I hope he still feels that way after what I have to tell him this weekend. I have a terrible feeling that the conversation will not go well.Ok and if by the grace of Beyonce you can get past this amateur hour writing, the characters are asstastic and plot has more holes than a cheese grater. Yes, yes, I know this is a popcorn thriller, so yeetage of disbelief is required. But I refuse to yeet my logic just for some Hallmark-grade entertainment. And once again, stop inserting ""intelligent"" and ""highly educated"" psychiatrists into these books if they\'re gonna have the logic of a bloated dead fish. Just stick with the naive mom of three who works in a craft store.SPOILERS SO SCROLL TO THE BOTTOMAt first Freida makes sure we know the house is very dusty, much dust, dust everywhere. And this dustiness grosses Tricia out because it totally clashes with Ethan\'s BMW (it\'s not a car, it\'s a BMW), her Manolo Blahnik boots and Ralph Lauren wool coat. But then she\'s okay with sleeping in her undies and bra in a bed that has been empty for THREE years?? And puts on a dead woman\'s RED FUZZY ROBE AND SLIPPERS?????? The real mystery is how the house was selectively dusty.Another one of my pet peeves is the unreliable narrator that lies for funsies, which of course we have in this shitshow of a book. Surprise, Tricia actually has a history with the house even though the readers are led to believe she\'s shooketh. And she had been stalking Ethan beforehand. Now why did she lie about these things? No reason, just trying to force a twist where there isn\'t one.Tricia\'s behaviour doesn\'t even make sense. So homegirl comes back to the house to find the bodyodyody that Dr. Hale left in the house (need that chemical spray she ordered off Amazon for my dog\'s bed tbh) but instead of searching the house, she decides to listen to recorded sessions... for what? Was she hoping that EJ would say ""hey, if you decide to murk me, can you bury me under your living room floor??? Tysm."" Priorities!!!!! This would\'ve made more sense if ETHAN listened to the tapes and then put 2+2 = Tricia is a crazy bish together.Lastly, tell me how Tricia can get away with murdering nearly ten people that are all intimately known to her. So her grammy and fiance and besties all die and no one bats an eye? Even Detective Pikachu could make the connections. Cmon now.Ok, I\'m going to cut myself off, but overall, this book was STANKY. I\'ve read two others by her: The Locked Door was ight and The Housemaid was not ight in the slightest.

Because it really doesn\'t.So many people have recommended McFadden to me. I actually went and picked up this book andThe Housemaidat the same time, but now I\'m reluctant to start her other stuff because parts of this were laughably bad.It\'s hard to say which was the worst thing. The repetition of the same thing over and over?It was a worrying reminder of the fact that I’ve only known my husband for a little over a year.It’s yet another reminder that I’ve only known this man for a little over a year.The way the author hammered us over the head with a red herring to the point that I felt a little insulted?Tricia discovers tapes of sessions with ""EJ"", a psychopath and wine connoisseur with a ""familiar"" voice. Her husband is called Ethan, is a wine connoisseur, has a temper sometimes, has no known friends or family and, she notes, she doesn\'t know him very well at all 🙄Or the ludicrous twists thatmayhave worked if this book had been written in third person, but in first person are utterly absurd?Also, the author does this weird thing where a character will say something via dialogue, then the narrator will make an extremely obvious observation about it in their inner monologue. For example:“Don’t let him manipulate you,” Ethan says. “He isn’t a good person. He killed [spoiler]. He killed one of the people closest to him. What kind of person does that?”Ethan doesn’t have a clue that [spoiler] isn’t the one who killed [spoiler].No shit! She does this multiple times.In some ways, two stars feels generous, but then I did blast through this with a need to know what the hell was going on. Not many authors manage to keep the suspense going like that.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Ok, I’m an outlier based on the reviews so far. I don’t think the book is bad or not worth reading, it has the Freida trademark suspense vibe with a crazy twist. It actually reminded me a bit of one of her previous book that I also had trouble with for the same reason as this one. Without going into too much detail my problem was that the ending made some of the previous events unlikely. There were too many inconsistencies. The author was clever when it came to leading you in a direction that might or might not be the right one, but that is because some reactions should have been different based on what you learned later.I also have an observation; Why did he go to work when they had no internet access in the house ?'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'A book that could’ve been so so good, if the author wasn’t desperate to throw in a twist that absolutely nobody could guess.The only problem is - no one guessed it because it made no sense.

Exciting!Did the writer actually read the first 200 pages before she published it? —asking for a friend.Tricia was so distraught and terrified because her new husband wants to buy the house they're currently snowed in which looks like a lived-in horror house in the middle of nowhere. Later we learn that everything was orchestrated and that she had different motives coming to the house. So, how is it that her emotions and state of mind in the beginning is not only inconsistent but strikingly contradictory towards the end. I guess we'll just chalk it up to antisocial personality disorder?This book's saving grace is that these two dysfunctional human beings ended up together, saving the world from their chaos. Well done, they deserve each other.Also, in this economy I can totally understand the urgency to close on a real estate property on a steal price and 100% get on board with living in a mcmansion in the middle of nowhere even if it's with dead corpses.“Everyone dies eventually, right? So unless we buy a brand new house, you’re kind of guaranteed somebody has lived in it who’s now dead. So what?”It's a good financial move. I can totally respect that.Poor writing.If this tried to be a read-it-again-for-a-different-story type of book, it failed.Mood setting is lousy. And I never appreciated the inner dialogues that just keeps on going in circles which only serves to make the characters look dumber but I get it, it does help fill the word count. For once, if the floor creaks I'd want someone to actually investigate and not be like'it be like that sometimes', 'that's just how it be'or not dismiss it with'maybe that's just — ', 'i guess it's —', if not, you best believe I'll be rooting for your character to dies first.I don't know about you butwhen I read psychological thrillers I crave for my brain to be challenged! I want it to be engrossing enough that I analyze everything and actually care about what happens next.I believe that precisely to be the hallmark of attentive reading/listening — it's when your audience comprehend the story enough that they are able to make solid assumptions and predictions as the story progresses. Don't you love it when you try to figure the mystery out? It's gratifying when you're right and incredibly disappointing when you don't. That in itself I think is a rewarding feeling as an author/creator/producer, to have your audience care about your work enough to be feel satisfaction in experiencing your stories/art. And I believe that is how the author and their readers communicate through the pages — forgive me for saying this but I believe that's the magic of books!Unfortunately, some thriller writer have become so invested in surprising their audience —so many twist!, woahhh the twist!, wait for the twist!— they try outmaneuver their audience that they messed up the story they had been building. This is exactly what happened here. Even worse isthe story completely ignored earlier events and details to fit the twist into its narrative!That's just mean and disrespectful.exhibit A:wearing boots not suited for the weather; if this was all planned, the least she can do is come dressed for the occasionexhibit B:showing of a real estate property that's not been cleaned or staged yet has food in store ... like that's not weird at allexhibit C:tape recorder battery that's still working after three years of no useexhibit D:not getting home security system a priority; it's 2022, I honestly cannot think of a single human being specifically of female species who would be so opposed to the idea of getting a home security installed in this day and age, I mean come on, don't you watch the freaking news?! You can buy a 360 camera on amazon for $40 or at least get a dog.exhibit E:trying to find a mobile service and when they did, they did NOT call the policeA good twist rewards the most attentive audience and while it's true that the most satisfying twist are the ones you figure out seconds before it's revealed, it's also imperative that the details and foreshadowing clicks into its place otherwise it's all just a big fat scam. As they say, the devil is in the detail.It's dark-lite. Not exactly addictive. It's a psychological thriller by virtue of it being sensational. Popcorn thriller for sure.Good thing it's short.I rated it 2 star and I explained my whys in great details. Avid fans can be so rabid sometimes.Edit: I was being generous by giving it a 2-star rating. It's a 0-star.

I really did not expect that twist and how everything tied up to it was 🤯Tricia and Ethan were the two characters we follow, both of them marry after only knowing each other for 6 months and decide to move to house far away from the city which was previously owned by Adrienne Hale antoher main character in this book who's pov follows the events that took place before tricia and Ethan move in. I would say I was expecting so many people but I just couldn't get any right 😭 and the way the pov switched and how tricias emotions, dialogues and the way she acted was described was truly amazing.The plot overall was very enjoyable because this was only 270 pages long but the way they alternated betweent he past and the present and the whole secret room with tapes scene and how every tape had a story and was explored in depth was amazing. The portrait scene was also so creepy 😭 + hiw Adrienne had a different story and how good it was and how everything intertwined together was amazing and ngl the atmosphere that this book created was 💯💯NowSPOILERS AHEAD‼️I was buddy reading this with Roxy and my first words to her were what kind of weird ass name is Tricia (sorry to anyone named Tricia) and she says thank god it's not named Patricia 😭😭😭 and the way Tricia was Patricia and she was also the one who killed everyone?? Like I did not see that coming, her being a murderer and killing Adrienne as well?? Wow! And the fact that I wanted to read this book again just to see how Tricia acted because the way she acted I was so sure that she was going to be the protagonist not the fucking antagonist. Also her husband also being a killer and them killing Adrienne's bf??

The MC is the killer and very familiar with the house, yet when reading from HER perspective in her own thoughts, she acts like she has never seen the house before and it's her first time inside it. Even though she gifted the painting to the psychiatrist, in her own head she acts like she's never seen it before. In her thoughts, she pretends to be suspicious of her own husband even though she knows his past and she also knows that she herself is the killer?This is deceptive and lazy writing.I gave it three stars because I couldn't put it down and read it in less than a day.

In the living room, there\'s this portrait of a woman with piercing green eyes that covers the whole wall. And also, there\'s this huge bookshelf filled with many copies of the same book, ""Anatomy of Fear"" written by a psychiatrist who was murdered three years ago. Is this her home? Did she die here?

Their plans take an unexpected turn when they find themselves stranded in the midst of a relentless snowstorm, compelling them to seek refuge in the seemingly deserted home of Adrienne Hale, a psychologist who mysteriously vanished without a trace.As the narrative progresses, it peels back the layers of this perplexing mystery, unveiling a web of intricate and sometimes twisted plotlines. Each revelation adds a new dimension to the story, keeping the reader utterly engaged and often taken by surprise. It\'s a narrative that gradually builds to a crescendo, leaving you with an ending that is not just jaw-dropping but also thought-provoking, resonating with you long after you\'ve turned the final page.I really enjoyed this book because my friends had raved about the author so much that they practically forced me to read it. The writing was straightforward and easy to follow, and the pacing was just right. What stood out the most was the plot\'s unpredictability. Unlike previous thrillers where I could often guess the twists early on, this book kept me guessing right up to the end. It was a refreshing change from the usual predictability I\'ve encountered in the genre.The pace at which the story unfolds is perfectly balanced, keeping my interest piqued throughout.The author\'s ability to seamlessly interweave both timelines added a beautiful dimension to the book, rendering it a truly accessible and engaging read. However, I encountered a writing style quirk that didn\'t quite align with my personal taste. It felt as if the narrative had a distinct influence from the Wattpad era, characterized by a prevalence of short, punchy sentences that often concluded rather abruptly. While this stylistic choice might appeal to many readers, I found it somewhat irksome. The lack of full sentences and the frequent terseness in the writing gave the prose a staccato quality, which, in my opinion, disrupted the fluidity of the narrative. This, of course, is a matter of personal preference, and others may not share the same sentiment.—Overall, if you\'re in the mood for a thrilling read that keeps you engaged from start to finish and delivers a jaw-dropping twist that you won\'t see coming, this book should be on your must-read list.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'You can tell when an author seems to be trying to hit a specific word count. A lot of words like “it’s” and “hasn’t” become “it is” and “has not” and so on. It makes it feel very choppy. Also why do we need entire paragraphs describing turning on a light or other mundane things? Lol …there were also many repetitive inner dialogues. At one point the characters inner dialogue said “this room is about the size of a walk in closet” … then two paragraphs later says “I was right about the size of the room, it’s about the size of a walk in closet” …another paragraph describing a bathtub and letting us know it had separate handles for hot and cold. Suffering through overly explaining the use of putting a tape in a cassette player, “I blow some dust off the tape recorder, then I pick up the tape I found. I remove the tape from the case and shake it out, then slide it into the tape deck. With one quick movement, I push the tape deck closed” …it just gives the vibe of trying to hit a specific word count rather than tell a story that flows.And how many times do we have to hear her tell us her friends think her husband she married that she barely knew has red flags but they are clearly wrong because he’s just “so sweet”? Or how many times do we have to hear that he wants this house and her thinking to herself “nope! Not going to happen!”? How many times do we have to hear that they saw a light on upstairs as they approached the house? We get it!!It’s so hard to concentrate on anything with the juvenile-esque writing style. It would be different if any of the characters were interesting or had a personality, but we don’t have that here either. Unless you count the female MC being utterly vapid as having a personality.

Next thing you know, turns out this vanilla lady is the one who killed the psychiatrist some odd years ago. There\'s more too. She was a patient of the psychiatrist. Her husband was another patient. And the psychiatrist murdered someone too. What is this, Oprah? You\'re a murderer. You\'re a murderer. Oh, YOU\'RE A MURDERER TOO! It\'s... so bad?

Her constant reiteration made him seem like a red flag. Don’t worry; this isn’t a spoiler; it’s what the author wants you to think.Now, about my theory, which what I was thinking when I was reading would have earned this book a 4 stars rating if it were true because it makes more sense than what the author wrote:EJ shares the same first initial as Ethan, right? They both have extensive knowledge of wine and share a love for it. Ethan seemed unusually comfortable in the house and appeared to know his way around a large place, suggesting he might have been there before. EJ had been there many times and was fascinated by the house, mentioning it repeatedly.So, one might think that EJ is actually Ethan, and poor Tricia is stuck with a narcissistic psychopath.If the story had ended with him killing her or her escaping, it would have made the book so much better. I can imagine keeping the first and middle parts of the book unchanged and only altering the plot twist; it would have made more sense.I can’t reveal the plot twist because I don’t want to spoil it, but I found it to be very disappointing, in my opinion.I understand why many enjoyed it, and I’m genuinely happy for those who gave it five stars, but it just doesn’t make sense to me and never will.'}]"

The only way the pages could have turned faster is if I had more hours in my day.The reason I am not givingNone of This Is Truefive stars, which I thought I would for 95% of the book, is that I feel conflicted about the ending. Maybe it is because I have certain expectations from Jewell at this point, and the ending here didn't fit with them... I just know that I wanted more from the final chapters. In a way, it felt unfinished. Could there be a sequel lined up?But back to me gushing about the stuff I loved because this is a cracktastic ride.Jewell throws together two women-- birthday twins, born on the same day in the same hospital -- from very different backgrounds. Alix Summer, with her seemingly perfect life as a podcaster and her seemingly perfect family in their beautiful house, and Josie, a woman from a council estate with a past filled with abuse, grooming and who-knows-what other horrors.When Josie proposes she be a guest on Alix's podcast to tell the story of her life, Alix is curious about this strange woman. Josie lets Alix into her life and history through the podcast and Alix, in turn, gradually lets Josie into her life too. But the more Alix comes to know Josie and her past, the more she worries she's made a terrible mistake.Lots of short, punchy chapters, interspersed with a Netflix documentary and podcast extracts, all make for a very fast-paced read. You know bad shit has happened from the start, maybereeeaaaaallllybad shit, but I didn't have a clue what, exactly, had gone down, and I was desperate to find out.Alix's life is nowhere near as shiny as it appears on the surface and Josie is just a fascinating character.

The ending is interesting and really got me thinking. My recommendation is to just go into the reading of this book with an open mind and without any preconceived notions as to what you think is going on, because that will probably change many times throughout.There were a few holes in the narrative and a few times that I thought the story could have been a bit tighter and less repetitive. However in the end I was able to overlook those factors and just go with it.And you have to be ready to set aside that a 13-15 year old CHILD cannot consent to a relationship regardless of how whackadoodle sociopathic she is. She just can\'t. And if Walter was turned on by that, then ew.

Josie is a train wreck of a character that I couldn’t look away from. Her character is one of the reasons I enjoyed this novel. At the same time, themes include pedophilia, alcoholism, and physical and emotional abuse, so it is not a fun read. It is also dark, tense, suspenseful, and has some major creepy vibes.

I buddy read this with my sister Irina, and part of the reason I love reading the same book as a friend or friends is due to the fact that you can really hash out your book review content ahead of time. We both ended up with similar feelings onNone of This Is True, and foremost agreed that it was a compulsive, must read suspense tale.Lisa Jewell is an incredibly talented storyteller, as she can really take the odd day-to-day occurrences and entwine them with clear and concise character development, giving birth to novels that allow the reader to fully engage with the cast of characters, no matter if they are likable or despicable. This book is no different, and the multiple povs really give us insight into the various narrators inner thoughts and feelings while the tension ramps up around them. Josie and Alix couldn’t be more different; they come from different lifestyles and circumstances, and yet… Could they be more similar than originally meets the eye?No spoilers, but there are some heavy themes discussed here. In fact, the build up of 85% of the novel is such a beautiful master class on slow burning suspense, and how to do it so that you don’t lose the reader in the process, that I was sure this would be Jewell’s darkest novel yet. The final 15% is what threw me for a loop. There are a few aspects that I had to overlook up until this point, behaviors and lack of affirmative action in the characters that I don’t think would play out the way it did in the book in real life, but understandably needed to be done to progress this particular story.However, my reason for not giving this a full 5 stars is that this final 15% felt as if it just lost steam and wasn’t sure of how it wanted to end, so it took a milder finale that had me feeling a little deflated, going from full speed ahead to a little bit of, “Wait, that’s it?” I believe the ending was designed to give the reader some authority over how they perceived not only the entire story, but also what happens after the final page is turned, although I would have been more satisfied with full closure.That said, this game of cat and mouse was such a deviously delightful read that I can’t help but highly recommend it for your 2022 TBR. While not my favorite Lisa Jewell novel, it is an immensely enjoyable read that will be a fantastic book club choice, brimming with copious discussion material.*Many thanks to the publisher for my review copy.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""2.5⭐️ the best part of this book is that it's finally overMy work colleagues might fight me on this one on Monday 🤭 was the premise good? yes, very good actually.

This was absolutely addictive!!When I first heard about this, I could hardly believe it. A story that follows two women turning forty-five, and I am turning forty-five this year. It can't be coincidence...I just knew I was going to love it and per usual, I was right. Not only did I love it, I freaking loved it. This will definitely be on myFavorites of the Yearlist.An added treat was Buddy Reading it with my beautiful niece, Lyss. I definitely recommend it for Buddy Reads or Book Clubs. There's a lot to discuss.This story follows two women, Alix Summers, a popular podcaster, and Josie Fair, an unassuming woman, whose profession is so inconsequential, I can't recall it.Alix and Josie bump into each other for the first time in the bathroom of a local pub, coincidentally on the day they were both turning 45. They were birthday twins!Shortly after, they bump into each other again outside of the school that Alix's children currently attend, and Josie's attended years ago.As they are chatting, Josie, who has listened to Alix's podcast, pitches an idea to her. Alix should do a podcast focusing on Josie's life.Josie tells Alix that she is on the brink of making some very drastic changes and she'd like Alix to document the process.Even though Alix finds Josie's vibe unsettling, she admits there's something fascinating about her. She is intrigued.Unable to resist temptation to dig into Josie's life, Alix accepts her offer and begins to record the podcast, inviting Josie to her home studio for interview sessions.From that point on, the women's lives become entangled. It doesn't take long for Alix to suspect that Josie is so much more than she initially appeared. Josie is a smart woman, who happens to be hiding some very dark secrets.Josie infiltrates Alix's life so deeply, she eventually ends up living at her house. Alix hardly knows how any of this happened and then suddenly, Josie's gone. That's when Alix's real nightmare begins.I was completely swept up in the lives of these two women. I loved the back and forth, learning about their past and present circumstances. Their dynamic, as well, was fascinating.Right off the bat, I was intrigued and I felt like I was being misdirected in some way. The path the story took, I was never quite sure who I could trust.As the story progresses, it's like a veil being pulled from your eyes, but I still couldn't believe what I was reading. It was so twisted!I absolutely recommend this to anyone who enjoys fast-paced and tense Psychological Thrillers. Bonus points if you have enjoyed Jewell's work in the past, or love stories that incorporate a podcast, or true crime, element.For the record, I thought Jewell nailed the podcast turned True Crime documentary angle. Additionally, her use of mixed media, with the sections from the Netflix series, was amazingly well done; round of applause.Thank you so much to the publisher, Atria Books, for providing me with a copy to read and review.

I liked how this book took the podcast element up a notch by adding a Netflix documentary spin. However, the last 20% of the book was a huge disappointment. Without getting into spoilers, this story has two possible scenarios that are left open for the readers' interpretation on what the truth is (if you don't like open ended endings then you won't like this book). However, either way you swing it, there is one particular character who is 100% a horrific person regardless of which scenario is correct. Sure, that particular character did meet their fate in this book, however, why did they get a redemption arc/sympathy. I thought it was in bad taste. Lisa Jewell completely missed an opportunity with this one, but instead decided to victim blame a 13-year-old who was groomed by a 40 year old and married her abuser. I almost settled on 2 stars because I did enjoy the book up until that point. However, the more time went by after I finished this book, the more enraged I became.

It is dark, and some have fairly remarked on how the matter of child abuse was treated. I don’t want to get into that, although I get why this is a sensitive topic. Despite the book being about dark topics, it read as a thriller and I liked the podcast angle. For some reason I like the twisted minds of someone with their own agenda, and the anticipation of what will happen next. You know something isn’t quite right, there are red herrings making feel uncomfortable inside, but you want to dive into the murky water to see the creatures lurking there. After all, isn’t that why we love unrealistic horror movies, because we can watch but still feel detached from it all? This isn’t a pleasant read, and it can easily become too much, but the exploration of themes like obsession, manipulation and warped mindsets did appeal to me.I think it’s best to make up one’s own opinion on this one, I get why some might feel uncomfortable, angry and frustrated by how some themes are handled.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""4 depraved, twisty, dark, and disturbing stars✨✨✨✨.

Josie in particular was detestable.The PlotAs the birthday celebrations get underway, a chance encounter between Josie and Alix reveals they not only share the same birth date, but they were also born in the same hospital, on the same day, and went to the same school.

Alix, whose husband, Nathan, is a binge drinker and frequently fails to come home, and Walter whose age gap has become even more noticeable to his much younger wife. Although she feels ‘groomed’ and controlled from the age of sixteen. A storyline which makes this difficult to endure in some parts, but they are real life issues so of course we should cover them.Alix is convinced by Josie to make her the subject and storyline of her next podcast which reaches out to thousands of women suffering domestic and psychological abuse, and women who enjoy hearing other life stories. What is to happen here though, changing format is the story has not yet completed. Its real time crime!!!.Review and CommentsThis story had me gripped throughout but I feel the ending let the book down a little. It was too contrived, and I failed to appreciate what drove this woman to do the things she did. I also enjoy more analysis when taking on difficult subjects and wanted a better ending for Roxy and Erin. The story behind Walter was left vague for me and didn’t conclude on the various aspects of his life and actions. Did he marry a much younger girl or was he guilty of ‘grooming’ her??. I settled on the former in the absence of any more detail. Even that was weird though.The ending did not spoil the book - it's just it could have been better. I would like to have seen the threads tied up nicely or differently, and then this would have been a clear 5 star book.However, for the plot as a whole this was excellent and whilst not entirely surprising, it was unpredictable which maintained the tension in the story. To have disliked some of the characters so much means Lisa Jewell did her job well. The suspense was palatable, the sense of danger and thrill was accretive and penetrating. The themes were well chosen. The underlying messages are great although some could have been fleshed out more, and the writing style just works a treat for me.I read this in day which I am deliberately not doing any more, because this was such a captivating read and a great book overall.A thrilling thriller, a chilling reminder to pick your friends carefully, and an immersive read that should keep you hooked.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4.3 🤯🤯'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Read this in one day and definitely enjoyed it!

Josie approaches Alix with the idea of being a subject of her next podcast feature citing the fact that she is in the process of making big changes in her life. Alix is both intrigued and a tad unsettled by Josie’s intensity and eventually agrees. Josie’s revelations about her past and her marriage are shocking and Alix finds herself becoming inextricably drawn into Josie’s narrative. Alix begins to doubt some parts of Josie’s revelations when she talks to people who know her and have interacted with her in the past. Just how much of Josie’s story is true? Josie seems to be fixated on Alix and is curious about Alix’s marriage which is also somewhat troubled. What follows is a complex web of lies, deceit, manipulation and murder. All is revealed when Alix becomes the subject of a true crime podcast to be featured in a Netflix documentary in 2020.None of This is TruebyLisa Jewellis a masterfully crafted work of psychological fiction- the kind of dark, edgy and suspenseful story that makes Lisa Jewell one of my favorite authors in this genre. Complex characters, shocking twists and several surprises (till the very end) and an ending that leaves you unsettled, made for a riveting read. I loved the structure of the novel, which is presented from the perspectives of Josie and Alix with transcripts of the podcast interviews (featuring Josie, Alix and several other characters) interspersed throughout the narrative.Having said that, there are a few things that keep me from giving this novel a higher rating. I know this is fiction and but a few things did bother me. None of the characters are particularly likeable (some worse than the others) which is fine. I know this is fiction but I could not ignore certain aspects of the story no matter how much I tried. Alix's inability to read the situation, her apparent blindness to several red flags in Josie’s behavior and her insensitivity to some extremely disturbing aspects of Josie’s life was off-putting. I also had issues with certain choices that were made in the handling of Josie’s present storyline. The author ventures into some very dark and disturbing themes in this novel (grooming, pedophilia, sexual abuse of a minor, trauma and mental health) and I’m not comfortable with the way those topics were presented.Overall, this is an intense and suspenseful read that delivers on the thrills. For the rest, it boils down to the reader’s ability and/or willingness to ignore certain aspects of the story.Many thanks to Atria Books and NetGalley for the digital review copy of this novel.

So when she “accidentally” bumps into her “birthday twin” again, a few days later, and Josie suggests that she might be an interesting subject, because Alix can follow her AS she changes her life instead of after someone has ALREADY done so, Alix decides to record a “test session” to see how it goes.A woman’s voice fades in…The things that Josie begins to share are QUITE shocking, and like an accident you can’t look away from, Alix cannot stop listening.BUT-how much of it is true?What if, NONE OF IT WAS TRUE?Alix has now passed the point of no return, and because of this-her recordings, interspersed throughout the narrative, have just become part of a TRUE CRIME podcast and SHE is now its subject.What will the result be, when the final screen fades to black?Who is Josie Fair, and what has she really done?There are TWO things you can ALWAYS count on with Lisa Jewell.First, if you handed me the first three chapters of a story in a binder, with no title and asked me to guess the author-I could identify her distinctive writing by her often QUIRKY and always well developed characters.Although our “host” Alix, is a likable mom, sister and wife-her husband, Nathan, has a bit of a drinking problem and often goes off on benders, not returning home until the next afternoon.And, we have Josie, the original subject of the Podcast, a shy woman who always dresses in denim, and who carries her Pomchi dog, Fred, clutched close to her chest in a denim pouch, his collar and lead, both made of denim too.

Now available as of 8.8!!**Imagine you\'re at a birthday dinner with anyone close to you...a friend, a significant other, a few family members.And though you\'re thrilled to be there and order something special, there\'s a TINY part of you that is dreading the possibility that at any moment, a server (or a cadre of servers) are going to come your way carrying a cake and singing the obligatory Happy Birthday song (or the restaurant approved version, anyway.)And what if THAT dread was only the beginning?While podcaster Alix Summers is out with her husband to celebrate her 45th, after the big song, a woman named Josie approaches the table and informs her that she is her TRUE birthday twin---down to the year. Though Alix finds this surprising, the two go about their separate celebrations and she figures that will be the end of it.UNTILJosie happens to run into Alix yet again - this time, outside of her children\'s school - and Josie has become completely enamored with Alix\'s podcast. In fact, she thinks she has the perfect candidate for Alix\'s next episode:Josie Fair herself.All Josie tells Alix initially is that she\'s looking for a change and a fresh start in her life...but nothing can prepare Alix for the details to come. Josie reveals shocking secret after shocking secret about her dangerous past and evenMOREdangerous present -- stories of grooming and abuse that haven\'t quite ended yet. Josie\'s predicament terrifies Alix...but at the same time, this mysterious and quirky woman slowly worms her way further into Alix\'s life...and her home.Although she wants to help her, Alix fears that this case may be far more involved than any she\'s explored in her podcast thus far. Will Josie\'s desperation to escape her situation lead her to say just aboutANYTHINGto get out, once and for all?And just how much of this \'true crime\' tale is, well, TRUE?Lisa Jewell has been around the scene for a while now: this is herELEVENTHthriller after making the transition from romance novels. Even Jewell herself has said her thrillers follow a general trend: now and then timelines, unlikable characters, at LEAST one teenage POV...and there\'s often a big \'didn\'t know they were related\' reveal.This formula has suited her well, and I\'ve never doubted her ability to write a compelling narrative.Whether I agreed with the way it played out or not, despite occasional uneven pacing, I\'m a Jewell fan through and through and also feel like I have a good sense of what to expect when I grab one of her books.Well. To say this one threwALL of my preconceived notions out of the windowCOULD be the understatement of theYEAR!This is a darker Jewell...a more DISTURBED Jewell...and in some ways it was everything I could have asked for in her evolution as an author.That being said, there were a few aspects of this plot that kept it from being a 5 star read for me and more than a few times I wished I could slowly back away from the characters in this book....and faster than Usain,BOLT!🏃\u200d♂️First off, I am the last person to be excited by the premise of a true crime podcast/documentary/Netflix show etc.But WOWZA. If Jewell wanted to shelve novel writing and jump into screenwriting TOMORROW, I think she could do it.The Netflix show ABOUT the podcast is cleverly and neatly interspersed into the narrative, and I kid you not, every time one of these sections popped up,I could almost SEE the drama unfolding before me.Rather than a plot device, it felt like an evocative and intriguing way to leave a tiny trail of breadcrumbs throughout the story to keep you dying for more detail, more insight, and that next provocative interview. Needless to say, if this were a real Netflix documentary...UTTERLY bingeable.These characters though...they might have been her most unlikable group to date. Even protagonist Alix has her blinders on selectively throughout and doesn\'t exactly do her due diligence with, well, anything. Josie is obviously a woman of mystery, but as a reader,I had a hard time buying her stories and suspected that a LOT was wrong with this situation (beyond the obvious).Nevertheless, I was excited to get to the bottom of things and had a hard time stopping myself from extrapolating endlessly as the novel wore on, with theory after theory about all of the players involved.But then it\'s revealed, amidst a sea of lies, that one story was TRUE: a character involved in grooming a young woman really DID groom said teenager.And where this should have left another character horrified, it was basically brushed aside entirely because the same character is painted to be a ""good guy"" for other reasons. Not only is this not the first time Jewell has done this sort of thing, but it took what wasSUCHa disturbing and powerful narrative to a sort of icky place. In a book that turns out to not be AS full of bad people as you may initially believe...there was no need for this turnaround.The character in question didn\'t really DESERVE any sort of redemptive mention or a \'pass\' for the disgusting behavior...EVEN if someone else turns out to be worse, and I just wish that Jewell hadn\'t soured such a strong and impactful story with this choice.At the end of a particularly sinister and AMAZING horror movie, I always have that moment where I\'m GRATEFUL to leave the theater, blink in the sunlight, and feel part of the less ominous real world.This book took me to that same sort of deep, scary place...and while I did manage to enjoy most of the ride?I have NEVER been more relieved to pick up my sunglasses and bask in the warm comforting glow of the summer sun!🕶 🌞4 stars'}]"

",Sarah J. Maas,4.18,1844259,354066,"Young Adult, Romance, Fiction, Magic, Young Adult Fantasy, High Fantasy, Audiobook",406,07-08-2012,"An alternative cover edition for this ISBN can be foundhere.In a land without magic, where the king rules with an iron hand, an assassin is summoned to the castle. She comes not to kill the king, but to win her freedom. If she defeats twenty-three killers, thieves, and warriors in a competition, she is released from prison to serve as the king's champion. Her name is Celaena Sardothien.The Crown Prince will provoke her. The Captain of the Guard will protect her. But something evil dwells in the castle of glass—and it's there to kill. When her competitors start dying one by one, Celaena's fight for freedom becomes a fight for survival, and a desperate quest to root out the evil before it destroys her world.","[{'rating': 1, 'content': 'Are you kidding me? What the hell is this shit? How do you screw up your story quite so badly after starting from an INCREDIBLE premise involving the most notorious assassin in the land - now a slave - being offered the chance to win back her freedom, sort of, in a ""to-the-death tournament - fighting the most gifted thieves and assassins in the land"" [says the back of my book, conveniently forgetting that (a) right before the final duels, the king specifically states that the competitors ""can win only by trapping [their] opponent[s] in a position of sure death ... andno further"" soto-the-deathmy foot, and (b) apart from thieves and assassins, a number of the competitors are actually ex-guards and random other criminals, for the most part disposable enough not to warrant names, and I\'d only consider a small handful of them to begiftedat anything]? I mean, you really have to be TALENTED to go from all of *that* Exciting Sounding Awesomeness to - well - toThrone of Glass.After reading the Q & A included in the back of my book, though, it all started to make sense, and I wish I\'d knownbeforebuying this stupid-ass book that it\'s inspired byDISNEY\'S CINDERELLA, of all things. I know what you\'re thinking:Where the fridge tart doesCinderellacome in? Isn\'t this story about, like, a TOUGH-AS-NAILS former-assassin-now-slave competing for her life in, like, the most badass tournamentever?Well ... actually, no. And I\'m happy to spend the next few hours of my life quoting this most dumbass book if it means AT LEAST ONE PERSON might decide not to waste their money on it, no need to thank me.\'""Wake up."" Not surprisingly, it was Chaol.She shimmied beneath the blankets, pulling them over her head, but he grabbed the covers and threw them to the floor. Her nightgown was wrapped around her thighs. Celaena shivered.""It\'s cold,"" she moaned, holding her knees to her body. She didn\'t care that she had only a few months to beat the other Champions - she neededsleep.[Nope, this isn\'t your bratty kid sister, but the most notorious assassin EVAH! You know, the one who - after slaving away in the salt mines for four months - was so desperate to escape that she even tried a mad suicide dash. What the hell, though; they\'reonlyoffering herher freedom.]It would have been nice if the Crown Prince had considered springing her from Endovier earlier so she could havesometime to regain her strength; how long had he known about this competition, anyway?[Sheesh. I know, right? Silly Crown Prince, not considering the feelings of, like, one of the most terrible criminals his men have ever captured. I mean, he gives you large, comfortable living quarters in his castle, a billiards table, a chance to change your life, even apuppy, and - what - he thinks this is enough?!]""Get up."" Chaol ripped the pillows from beneath her head. ""Now you\'re wasting my time."" If he noticed how much skin she was showing, he didn\'t react.[That wasn\'t irrelevant at all ... ]Grumbling, Celaena slithered to the edge of the bed, dangling a hand over the edge to touch the floor. ""Fetch my slippers,"" she mumbled. ""The floor\'s like ice.""[Yeah, put those servants in their place, Cinderella!]...From the doorway, Chaol asked, ""Why, might I ask, are you so tired?""She gulped down the rest of the pomegranate juice and wiped her mouth on a napkin. ""I was up until four reading,"" she said.\'[Why do you even have to ask, Chaol? It\'s only the start of the tournament of Celaena\'s life; of course she stayed up all night reading. SLEEP WHEN YOU\'RE DEAD, YO!! If the competition barely merits any page time, why should the competitors actually give a shit about it?!]\'A few minutes later, Celaena frowned at herself as she hurried after the captain into the foyer. ""I look ridiculous! These pants are absurd, and this shirt is awful.""\'[Way to be descriptive, Cinderella! Generic complaints FTW! It\'s not like you\'ve been slaving in the salt mines for a year, or anything like that, OF COURSE YOUR CLOTHES MATTER and HOW DARE THEY?! DON\'T LET THE BASTARDS GRIND YOU DOWN!!?!!?!!]\'""You expect me to use a mace an hour after sunrise?""\'[The horror!]\'She bit into an apple. It was tart, with a sweet, honey-like aftertaste. ""Oh? And what books do you love?"" He named a few, and she blinked. ""Well, those are good choices - for the most part. What others?"" she asked, and somehow, an hour flew by, carrying them on the wings of conversation.\'[Jesus. This paragraph isn\'t a pointless waste of space at all.]\'There was something girlish about her, too. Oh, he couldn\'t stand her contradictions!\'[INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS!!! Because *my* Chaol doesn\'t have a va-jay-jay ... ]\'Celaena bit down her laugh. Archery? It was anarcherycontest?\'[Yeah, that was my reaction, too ... ]\'Pelor, the gangly assassin, wasn\'t yet strong enough to manage a longbow, and barely made any shots. When he finished, his eyes gleaming with resentment, the Champions sniggered, and Cain laughed the loudest....Despite herself, Celaena felt badly for the boy. His shots hadn\'t beenthatbad.\'[Yeesh! If barely making any shots isn\'t *that* bad, I can see howCINDERBRATis the world\'s scariest assassin.]\'""Why would she kill me? I think she likes being pampered.[*snort*]If she hasn\'t attempted to escape or kill anyone, then why would she do it now?"" He patted his friend on the shoulder. ""You worry too much.""\'[ZOMG! U NVR HERD OFBIDING UR TIMEB4? This Crown Prince is clearly not the brightest crayon in the box.]\'Sam. What would he make of all this?\'[Since he\'s never been mentioned before, I really can\'t say. Sorry.]\'Dorian peeled himself from the wall. For all her assassinating experience, she didn\'t notice him until he sat down on the bench beside her.\'[Yeah, I can see why she\'s Most Baddest Assassinator EVAH! And who glued you to the wall, anyway, Crown Douche Bag?]\'""No. I can survive well enough on my own - if given proper reading material.""He looked at the fire, trying not to think about where she\'d been only weeks before - and what that kind of loneliness might have felt like. There were no books in Endovier.\'[I find it hard to believe thatlonelinessis your biggest problem when you\'re a beautiful seventeen-year-old girl slaving away in a salt mine, but ... what do I know? A BOOK!! A BOOK!!MY KINGDOM FOR A BOOK!!!!]\'It wasn\'t until later that Philippa brought the news. The Champion who hadn\'t shown up for the Test had been found dead in a servant\'s stairwell, brutally mauled and dismembered.The new murder cast a pall over the next two weeks, and the two Tests they brought with them. Celaena passed the Tests - stealth and tracking - without drawing much attention to herself or risking her neck to save anyone.\'[When your plot\'s so boring that you\'re summarizing it all, you\'ve got a problem ... ]\'He remained in the doorway, fearful that she\'d wake up if he took another step. Some assassin. She hadn\'t even bothered to stir.\'[I know, right? Also, you\'re a stalking stalker, Crown Douche Bag!]\'She smiled at the young chevaliers they passed - and smirked at the court women who eyed her pink-and-white gown. She couldn\'t blame them; the dress was spectacular. And she was spectacular in it.\'[Bloody hell, you\'d think a year of slavery would knock the vanity right out of a girl ... ]\'The assassin pivoted around the table and took aim again. She missed. Gritting her teeth, she considered snapping the cue in half across her knee. But she\'d been attempting to play for only an hour. She\'d be incredible by midnight! She\'d master this ridiculous game or she\'d turn the table into firewood.\'[Now, now,CINDERBRAT. Temper tantrums are, like,sounbecoming.]\'""For the world\'s greatest assassin, this is pathetic,"" said Dorian, stepping from the doorway.\'[Because assassins are widely known to be proficient at billiards. What, you didn\'t know??]\'She had often wished for adventure.\'[If you spend seven years as an assassin and somehow managenotto stumble headfirst into all sorts of adventures,you\'re probably not doing it right.]\'So she\'d cheated a little, but she\'d won.\'[LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, HOLD ON TO YOUR SEATS; WE\'VE JUST HAD OUR FIRST GLIMPSE OF CELAENA ACTUALLY BEHAVING REMOTELY LIKE AN ASSASSIN!!!! And it\'s only page 240 ... ]\'It had been over three weeks since her last encounter with Elena, and she hadn\'t seen or heard her at all, despite the three Tests she\'d had, the most exciting of which being an obstacle course, which she passed with only a few minor scratches and bruises. Unfortunately, Pelor hadn\'t done so well, and had been sent home at long last. But he\'d been lucky: three other competitors had died. All found in forgotten[well, obviously notthatforgotten]hallways; all mutilated beyond recognition.\'[The plot overload! It\'s ... it\'s ... positively ... unbearable ... ]\'Amidst her worrying, another Test passed without incident or embarrassment - though she couldn\'t say the same for the soldier who\'d been sent home - and she kept up her intense training with Chaol and the other Champions.\'[WOW: So Much Story! How can I process it all?]\'""Candy!"" A large paper bag sat on a pillow, and she found that it was filled with all sorts of confectionary goodies. There was no note, not even a name scribbled on the bag. With a shrug and glowing eyes, Celaena pulled out a handful of sweets. Oh, how sheadoredcandy!Celaena issued a jolly laugh and crammed some of the candy into her mouth....""Someone,"" she said in between chews, ""isverygood to me.""\'[I just ... oh God ... I have no words! :D Cookie Monster strikes again?]\'""Of course I want her,"" Celaena said, then realized what the implications would be. ""But I want her trained. I don\'t want her urinating on everything and chewing on furniture and shoes and books. And I want her to sit when I tell her to and lay down and roll over and whatever it is that dogs do. And I want her to run - run with the other dogs when they\'re practicing. I want her to put those long legs to use.""Dorian crossed his arms as Celaena scooped up the dog. ""That\'s a long list of demands. Perhaps I should have bought you jewelry after all.""[Hold your puppies, Dorian,CINDERDIVASTILL isn\'t done.]""When I\'m training"" - she kissed the pup\'s soft head, and the dog nestled her cold nose against Celaena\'s neck - ""I want her in the kennels, training as well. When I return in the afternoon, she may be brought to me. I\'ll keep her in the night."" Celaena held the dog at eye level. The dog kicked her legs in the air. ""If you ruin any of my shoes,"" she said to the pup, ""I\'ll turn you into a pair of slippers. Understood?""\'[Jesus Christ. Is it bad that what *I* want is for someone to rend Celaena limb from limb? And why does she have a bunch of shoes, anyway? Am I the only one who remembers that she\'s a fucking FORMER-ASSASSIN-NOW-SLAVE?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!]\'Philippa huffed. ""Just don\'t tell themIhelped you when you get dragged back here.""\'[Sure, because if Celaena says nothing, they\'ll probably assume it was one of her other, non-existent maids who helped her navigate her way into her dress.]\'Frowning, Chaol watched his friend dance with the assassin. He wouldn\'t have danced with her, anyway. And he was glad he hadn\'t worked up the nerve to ask her, not after seeing the color that Duke Perrington\'s face turned upon discovering the pair.\'[WTF isthe authorChaol talking about? What actually happens five minutes prior to this is that Celaena asks him to dance and he says no. Also, this guy\'s kind of a wussy-with-a-""p"" for a Captain of the Guard. He\'s never even killed anyone before. Yeesh. Captain of the Guard, my foot.]\' ... Cain was little more than a pawn in a game to amuse the king ... \'[That\'s what they keep saying, but the king isn\'t evenpresent in the castlefor the majority of the competition, so ... ]Oh, one more thing: THE NAMES! How the heck do you pronounce Chaol? Kale? Like the cabbage? And Kaltain Rompier has to be one of the stupidest names I\'veEVERcome across. It makes me think of frolicking unicorns, or ... something. As for the main character, well, I don\'t even know what to call her. Selena? Kay-lay-na? (that\'s the one I eventually settled on, after spending half the book mentally mumbling her name) I mean, what in Erilea kind of a name is Celaena? Is it really any wonder that Nehemia eventually renames her?! Other people get normal enough names, such as Dorian and Grave and Sam and Elena and Xavier and Cain and Philippa and Verin and Ned; simple names, really. I guess the special snowflake needs a special name to go with her very special personality impairment. Don\'t even try to get me started on the place names, because I tuned them out after Eyllwe, so I have no idea how these countries / lands / coffee beans relate to one another, but I\'ll probably live.And what is even the point of the glass castle? Or the non-existentthrone of glassthat the book\'s apparently named after? Thinly-veiledCINDERELLAreferences FTW!!!! If you ask me, the author should have gone forCinderella in Candyfloss Land!, because you certainly don\'t get much more than that. I don\'t even know what Celaena spends most of the second half of the book doing. The tournament trials and murders are mentioned in passing here and there (Yesterday we threw knives! Another three people were eaten over the past three weeks!) and the book focuses on - I don\'t know what - Celaena sitting in her room, Celaena fawning over herself in front of one mirror or another, Celaena boasting about her amazing assassin skills that you\'d otherwise never know she had, Celaena going for walks, Celaena admiring pouffalicious dresses,CinderellaCelaena wishing someone would invite her to the ball, Celaena eating sweets, Evil King being evil, and Frolicking Unicorn being high. It\'s ... exciting stuff. Really.Also, since when do slaves have possessions? Why does some random slave (whoimmediatelygets murdered by some random people, so yay for the Drama Llama) have enough salve to pass around as required? Who makes this salve? From what? Who are these slaves allowed to associate with that they can procure salve? What do they trade for this salve? Their bodies? Their hair? Salt they\'ve squirrelled away from the mines? Yeesh! Explain yourself, Sarah J. Maas!UGH! Terrible, terrible, horrendous. Nonsensical, stupid, pointless. Fluffy, pathetic, ridiculous. Need I say more? Really? Need I?Throne of Glasstries to emulatePoison Study... and fails ...spectacularly. Save yourself the torture and go straight forPoison Study. If you\'ve already readPosion Study, read it again.

Happy Reading:)'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'It feels likeThrone of Glasshas been a book I\'ve been thinking about maybe reading for a million years. The reviews and ratings from my GR friends on this book are very mixed and I can easily see why after finishing this entertaining but disappointingly tame and romance-y young adult fantasy.Throne of Glassis likeShadow and Boneround two. The premise is awesome for both: full of hardcore warriors/assassins, royal/noble secrets and scandals, a touch of magic... but each one, though entertaining, quickly hangs up its weapons and becomes far more concerned with dresses, bitchiness and whether or not that sexy dude thinks the MC is hot (he does).This book is to the fantasy genre whatTwilightis to vampires; though I have to stress that it is a fast-paced, compelling read and Maas does tame fantasy as well as it can be done. Despite my frequent eyerolls and disappointment at the romantic turn the story took, the pages seemed to fly by. I tend to read several books at once; I\'ll spend a few chapters with one and then mix it up by moving on to another, butThrone of Glassmanaged to hold my attention from start to finish with no time for interference from another book. This, in itself, was quite an achievement.Celaena Sardothien is the star of this show. A former assassin turned prisoner, she spends every day in the salt mines prison of Endovier. Having given up on hoping for freedom, she wishes only for death. That is, until one day The Crown Prince (Dorian) and his Captain of the Guard (Chaol) arrive with a proposition for her - fight in a competition, win, become the King\'s Champion for four years, and finally earn her freedom. It\'s an offer Celaena can\'t refuse. But, of course, things aren\'t that simple. Some dark evil is at work inside the King\'s castle; something that is killing off the competitors one by one. Plus, there\'s the handsome Prince and moody Captain to deal with too.I don\'t think Celaena is in the King\'s palace for a day before she starts obsessing over her looks, her new dresses and whether or not either or both of the aforementioned men find her attractive. She still manages to have more badassery than Alina inShadow and Boneand the book is, in my opinion, nowhere near as boring asGrave Mercy. But, still, I couldn\'t help being like ""BUT you said ASSASSIN!"" when she\'s there swanning around in front of the mirror. I like that she\'s ""feminine"" (whatever you want to take that to mean) as well as a brutal killer, but there\'s only so much high school changing rooms behaviour I can take. I think there\'s an excellent quote, a question that Celaena wonders to herself, that basically sums up what was running through my head for a lot of this novel:""How had she gone from the most feared prisoner in Endovier to this sappy mess?""How, indeed. But, that being said, I really enjoyed the banter between her and Chaol. And Dorian wasn\'t bad either. I\'ve said it before but I\'ll say it again for the benefit of this review: I actually don\'t mind love triangles when they\'re convincing and both candidates for the MC\'s heart are on equal footing so there\'s some tension over who they\'re going to end up with. Though I may have to do all kinds of evil things - like... stomping around my bedroom angrily or letting library books become overdue - if Celaena doesn\'t end up with Chaol. Ms Maas, you\'ve been warned.So, yes, I will be readingCrown of Midnight, god help me. I\'m hoping it will please me more than the sequel toShadow and Bonedid, but the ending of this does make me think the second book could have more action and nastiness (yes!). I think you can enjoy this book if you go into it knowing exactly what you\'re letting yourself in for. It isn\'t high fantasy. It isn\'t mind-blowing. But it is kinda fun *grins*'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Madre mía, ¿por qué no he leído esto antes?Por fin, y después de casi diez años, me he puesto manos a la obra con el primer libro de la sagaTrono de Cristalde Sarah J Maas. ¿Me arrepiento de no haberla comenzado antes? Rotundamente sí. Qué pedazo pistoletazo de salida para una obra tan grande, y qué de sorpresas me he llevado… Venga, vamos por partes.En líneas generales,considero queTrono de Cristaltiene un buen ritmo.No recae demasiado en descripciones pesadas, porque si lo hace es usualmente importante en algún momento más adelante. Hay unmuy buen equilibrio entre la duración de los capítulos, las escenas, los diálogos, momentos de introspección de los personajes y momentos de acción.Creo que está todo cuadrado al dedillo y hace que te sumerjas en la historia sin ninguna complicación.Celaena es un PEDAZO DE PERSONAJE.Enamorado de ella desde el primer momento, en serio. No solo es decidida y se la sudan completamente cosas como la monarquía, sino que es despiadada, sangrienta, extremadamente inteligente y curiosa, y la mejor asesina del reino.Es brutal.Sin embargo, también tiene su corazoncito, y ese punto de inflexión en su personalidad me ha terminado de encandilar.Personajes como Nehemia, Dorian o Chaol construyen un universo alrededor de Calaena que me fascina.Cada uno de ellos está muy bien definido, conectas con ellos, sus emociones y sentimientos, y creo que todos aportan algo a la trama de una manera u otra.Quizá he echado de menos más personajes como Nox, es decir, campeones de la competición con los que Calaena se acercara, pero lo que aportan personajes como Nehemia creo que lo compensa de sobra.El estilo de Maas no es nuevo para mí. Ya había leídoUna corte de rosas y espinas.En este caso, sin embargo, me ha entrado más fácil por los ojos. No sé si es porque es su primera novela, pero no creo que sea tan rimbombante como lo es en ACOTAR. Va más al grano, perono deja en ningún momento de escribir con esa pluma tan característica de la fantasía épica(con esto me refiero desde a uso del lenguaje a estructura concretas). Todo un acierto. La misma historia escrita de otra forma no me habría gustado tanto.Respecto a la historia...DAMN GURL!No me esperaba para dónde iba a ir la novela. Me encanta todo el tema de persona elegida que va a una competición a destacar, que es un tropo o cliché bastante visto. Sin embargo, los momentos donde se comienza a incluir magia o historia ancestral del universo donde se desarrolla la historia...Gloria bendita.Menuda sorpresa.Se me eriza el pelo pensándolo, porque no me esperaba para nada que la historia realmente tratara sobre eso y que se vaya a dirigir hacia ahí.Sé que esto es tan solo una introducción, pero estoy deseando ver hasta dónde puede llegar, porque de momento estoy fascinado.Creo quela autora presenta los elementos necesarios para comenzar a dibujar un imaginario sobre el universo creado,desde la magia hasta criaturas o leyendas antiguas, dinastías monárquicas y casas, relaciones de poder, estratos sociales o incluso economía y política. Plantea todo de una forma sencilla, fácil de captar, para desarrollarlo más profundamente en las siguientes entregas.Agradezco que no entre a trapo con esas cosas y que se centre más de momento en el personaje principal y los secundarios,porque creo que una historia sin buenos personajes, pues chica, me da igual. Así quewell done.Y bueno,el triángulo amoroso...Mira,nome ha disgustado. ¡Para mi sorpresa lo he disfrutado! Creo que las dinámicas no solo entre Calaena con los chicos, sino entre ellos mismos están muy bien pensadas y contadas.Todo es justificado y creo que Maas no peca de enamoramientos a primera vista o cosas extrañas que podemos ver en otras novelas juveniles del estilo.Las relaciones y romances parecen surgir con delicadeza pero de forma natural, y es algo que he agradecido enormemente. Deseando estoy -al igual que con la magia- de ver cómo se desarrolla.En definitiva,Trono de Cristalme parece una espectacular manera de comenzar una saga de fantasía tan extensa como esta.Me ha sorprendido y superado mis expectativas. De hecho, cerré el libro y de seguido abríCorona de Medianoche,la continuación.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""4.45/5 ⭐Full review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolf🐺I am an occasional liar. I don't lie often, but when I do lie, trust me, I might pass as a lie-detector scammer, don't test me, I'm ruthless. But in general, I prefer to be brutally honest and direct. That's my true nature.Today, I could've easily lied and said that I've wanted to read this book,Throne of Glassby Sarah J. Maas, for as long as I remember, but I’ve chosen to tell the truth instead: two months before actually reading it I’ve heard about this book and it didn’t appeal to me, mostly because of the cover somehow?? I know, I am a hypocrite (don’t judge a book by its cover, remember?), but the cover itself has (in my opinion) a crucial role in my own personal pick of a reading. And this particular cover felt like it wanted to intimidate me so bad.I actually tried to readThrone of Glassonce before, earlier in the year, and I managed to stop after preciselytwo words, change my mind and read something else. I don’t know what got into me then, but I dropped it like it’s hot, really.But boy was I wrong because I actually enjoyed it and it was VERY readable.I can’t say that I particularlylovedany of the characters, at least at the beginning. They all seemed to be so stereotypical that I quit trying to bother: the narcissistic prince, the oppressed heroine with a shady background, the wicked king scared of magic, the hard-core right hand of the narcissistic prince, the misogynistic brute etc., etc. But as the plot developed, I started liking this hard-core gorilla bodyguard with the name of Chaol, this narcissistic prince with a flirty nature, but with a real love for knowledge, this oppressed heroine which made a name for herself, but preferred to use it just to cover herself because that was a choice she could make.To be completely honest, the most beautiful relationship of them all is the one between Celaena and Princess Nehemia of Eyllwe. Their friendship is so pure and so natural that it seems like their souls have been friends since the moment the world was created. If I’d had to truly ship someone, I’d ship them both, because, let’s be real, they are, on their own, passionate, dedicated and strong women, but together, they make the perfect team. As I heard some lady in a bus saying once: “Us women are stronger when we stick together” and yes, it is so true and so accurate for Celaena’s and Nehemia’s situation too.There are two important things about a book:it has to teach you somethingandit has to help you escape your own reality. I don't know about you, people, but I read books in order to escape my own cruel reality (because that is the reality – a cruel and devious lifetime lasting wake-up call) and I recently discovered that fantasy books are the best remedy for an ordinary life. There is another life to live in a fantastic story, whenever the presented world is amazingly constructed and erected before our mind’s eye.To claim that and also deep, 7-D characters with some serious wisdom passages attached to the neatly done plotline is totally just a whole load ofbull, if you’d pardon my fluent French.I, for instance, do not judge a book by the lack of one of those aspects, but I judge it by the way it makes me feel and by how wholesome it is as an entity (and by its cover, of course!). This is maybe why almost every time I find something positive that I liked in a book that contributes to my general opinion about it. And this is also the case for this one!As the plot develops, the storyline becomes more and more intriguing until it reaches a point where things turn out dark and fantastic. What seemed to me at the beginning asokay-ishturned out to be, towards the end, a great, imaginative story. I am beyond happy that I was wrong! (That means the book is good because I rarely am wrong and I even rarely admit that Iwaswrong!).Celaena Sardothien, world’s best assassin, proves everyone that, after all, no matter how hard life beats us down, we must raise our head high up and keep fighting, because we all are beaten down by Life, but not all of us show this the same way:“We all bear scars, Dorian.

After enticing me with its promises of a reading experience reminiscent of Megan Whalen Turner and George R.R. Martin, Throne of Glass ultimately let me down. Having been excited for this novel for weeks and actually liking the sample I read, I have been brought back to earth now – with a jolt. This YA fantasy is a rather sorry example of its genre.I have the notion that a big part of this book did not work for me because of its heroine. Celeana is smart, athletic, talented and beautiful. She loves music and reading. She is fluent in different languages. She is great. And she knows it. And rubs it in your face repeatedly. As do her suitors and admirers. I had the feeling that Sarah J. Maas tried everything to make me love her heroine. How do you make readers love someone? Present them with a book lover! But somehow, she accomplished the opposite. I did not loathe Celaena, but she grated on my nerves. I wished someone would tell her off, would for once not grant her every wish; I wished the characters I liked would not fall for her charms and good looks.The little romance Celaena had (I won't say with whom) was laughable at best and mostly resulted in me rolling my eyes at the fact that the only attraction that existed between those two stemmed from them both being beautiful.In terms of plot, I cannot deny that there was always a level of suspense present. I did want to know how this story ended, and yes, there were actually parts when I feared the whole thing would not end well – partly because my beloved heroine did not deem it necessary to inform certain people about what she had witnessed in the castle. Overall, though, the story remained a tad too juvenile and simple for me. Important events were mentioned only in passing and the mythology did not go any further than what was important for the main story line. Many things remained unsaid – doubtlessly for the sake of sequels yet to come – but it was not the subtle way of remaining unsaid but hinted at I love in fantasy novels, it felt more like remaining unsaid to lure me into reading on.There were aspects I liked - Celaena's friendship to Nehemia, the Eyllwe princess, and Chaol, the loyal and fierce captain of the guard – but in the end, there isn't enough to make me interested in reading any sequels.In short - what I wanted: A less is more mentality. World building that does not only cover what is necessary to follow the main story arc. Subtle romance. Villains in different shades of grey. Assassins that actually assassinate. And do not only sit in their room talking or thinking about clothes and boys. What I got: A vain and mostly unlikeable heroine. Two men absolutely bedazzled by her presence. Hints of a love triangle. Lots and lots of descriptions of clothing. Flimsy world building. An overall poor execution writing-wise. Thank you.

I never liked the first cover, and am infinitely grateful that they changed them for the sequels. But as far as how Celaena herself is? I would say she\'s a bit of both. I feel like these covers portray two very different extremes, and Celaena seemed to possess a quality from each of them. That\'s actually what I loved about her. She\'s fast becoming one of my all-time favorite YA heroines.I\'ll admit that a long while ago, I hadn\'t expected the book to be this good.

The characters were well formed and excellently developed. There are recognisable and enjoyable twists on the classic Cinderella. Example Celaena Sardothien's fairy godmother is a ghost of an ancient warrior queen. There are also slight touches, such as Celaena having an innate charm with animals.I was also very impressed with the pacing and evolution of the story. Honestly, the 406 pages just seem to fly by. Just because Celaena was the greatest of assassins after being in a death camp for over a year, she needed to capture her old form, but her skills are still intact. Also, I like the way the author plays with her feelings. Even though she is an assassin, she is still very young and prone to her feelings and ego getting hurt.The book does leave a lot of questions, many of which are for the second novel, but as much as I hate prequels, I will have to read the backup stories on the Kindle version. I can't wait for the next book and am really looking forward to what is going to happen next.

I take full offense at badassery being missed.But seriously, guys, this book suffers from fuckingterriblecharacter work.Thesis Statement:Celaena is a badly written character.She is arrogant as hell, really petty, and somewhat obsessed with her own appearance. Andthat\'snot even the problem - a horribly unlikable assassin as a lead character could be amazing. But Celaena doesnothave enough character depth for her unlikability to be tolerable. Her alleged tragic past? Pretty much not represented on page. Frankly, tragic pasts need alotof fleshing out to be compelling and believable, and I don\'t even think Celaena\'s trauma is acknowledgedoncein this book - come on, at least do the bare minimum?Listen, okay, you want to get me started on my #1 pet peeve in YA for all eternity?Heroines that have less sense than the audience. I like my heroines to be one step ahead of me, or at my level. Let\'s talk about the fact that Celaena is just... a complete idiot.Some assassin. I am 98% sure I have more sense than this character / prop for love triangles does. Like, I\'m sorry, but how am I supposed to be intimidated by someone who 98% of the audience could outthink?I am so disappointed by all this character could have been and all this character is not. completely lighthearted. Again, that could be super enjoyable to read about! I\'d LOVE a book about a slightly unbalanced girl who murders people with a smile on her face. This could be Celaena if she were cleverer and a bit - okay, a lot - more fleshed out. But she\'s just an unbelievable, annoying heroine.And Jesus,I am so annoyed by the love triangle. Dorian is just flat as hell and has no character. Chaol is... okay, I know someone is going to fight me over this but I do not care.Chaol is an overprotective ass. I can\'t believe he\'s supposed to be the good romantic interest compared to Rowan. Jesus, how bad is Rowan?

Maas novel, and I don’t understand the hype. Warning: extremely sarcastic book review coming up!Celaena Sardothien is the world’s most famous assassin. However, she has been captured and is doing hard labor in a mine. Today is her lucky day though. The kind and absolutely dashing Prince Dorian arrives to save the day! Celaena can enter a competition to be the King’s Champion. If she wins the competition, she then has to serve four years of service under the king, and then she is free! Yippie!The concepts in this book sound right up my alley. Female characters? Yes. However, my gosh, this is probably the most unlikeable character that I have ever endured. I was hoping that someone would finish her off.Celaena is one of the least humble characters ever written. She is the female version of Gaston from Beauty and The Beast but worse. So much of the book is about, “Oh, I could take this guy down with one bat of an eye.” Give me a break. When she finally arrives for the competition, she does not seem to do any training other than what is forced on her by Prince Dorian or Chaol. If you want to be the best at something, you usually have a routine. Each day, you know exactly what to do to train and prepare.Celaena likes to sleep in and dream of kissing. I really wish that I was still producing Booktube videos because this book would make a great spoof video. I will just have to do my best to state the overexaggerated nature of Celaena.If Celaena was a book influencer, she started reading when she was three-months old. She has read a book in every state and country. She has read every book on every checklist, and she has a photographic memory. When she gets ready for a book quiz, she doesn’t even open the book to refresh her memory. And she giggles and dreams of boys kissing her. Tee-hee!The “romance” in this book is absolute cringe. One of her suitors is so struck by her beauty. Apparently, Celanea should have a GoodReads account, because nearly every day she could have the opportunity to receive creepy “hey beautiful” messages from fake accounts. This would make her swoon. Although someone can compliment a person on his or her beauty, so what? Beautiful is primarily about winning the genetic lottery. If you want to really compliment a person, say something about their work ethic, their kind and gentle nature, their thirst for knowledge, their passion to change the world.Throne of Glass is so boring. The King’s Champion has various stages to the competition. Because of the writing style, the suspense did not build. There is a stage of the competition, and it is described in a paragraph or one page. And people die in this book. However, our “world-famous” assassin Celaena does very little about it. Sucks to be them I guess. She is too busy thinking about kisses. The characters aren’t developed enough so when they die off, no one cares.This book completely lacks the strong female characters that I love. This is a love-sick assassin who doesn’t really show her full capabilities. It is really hard to take her seriously when she spends more time pouting about festivals and dreaming of kisses than preparing to win the championship.Also, anyone who has less than perfect skin is “bad” in this book. I have a real problem with this. Beauty is only skin deep, and I would rather have a partnership with someone with bad skin and has a bit of sense than someone who is “gorgeous” and can’t hold up their end of a conversation. But personal preference.Overall, the concept of a strong female assassin in a slightly fantasy setting sounds appealing; however, Sarah J. Maas did not execute it properly in Throne of Glass. If you really want a strong female character in a fantasy setting, I highly suggest The Golden Compass or Northern Lights by Philip Pullman.

I can see that. I actually could see a writing style development between the first and the second half of the book.This to say that, since from the beginning, I didn’t expect much.But since I’m here do discuss books and not to dig into the author’s background, I’ll admit I’m not a huge fan of the writing. Too many exclamation points!!!!!!too much self-indulgence in the characters descriptions and actions, and, definitely, too much walking around the edges.Sometimes I like it when a bookshowsits contents rather than shoving them explicitly into the writing as to say “hey, here’s how you’re suppose to interpret said emotion and fact”, and so on.I don't like that, nuh-uh.Plus, most of the time, it really looked and felt like a thirteen-year-old fangirl wrote a fanfiction based on scratches of books she's seen her big sister read.The plot is not bad. There’s magic and princes and the right amount of stabby-stabbing.Not bad, but not breath-taking, either. I'm not giving up, though, because I trust my fellow readers and I believe it when they say it's gonna get better.Well,Now, another thing that threw me almost completely off the Throne of Glass Train, was the main character, Celeana Sardothien.Oh, boy. I had such a hard time with this one.Not only I didn't connect with her and her way of thinking before the very last chapters, she's also made it into my Top 3 of most annoying characters thanks to her immaturity.I think only America Singer fromThe Selectionand Zoey Redbird fromMarkedcould top that, and this is saying a lot.She’s like that popular chick in high school who thinks she’s head and shoulders above the others. She’s like Regina George with daggers and an even snarkier holier-than-thou attitude.Basically Celeana in every single line ever:For someone who's supposed to be a deadly assassin, she's pretty weak and dull. I get it that she's a girl who likes being pretty and wearing nice clothes and dating hot boys (I actually love it when a female character can be girly and badass at the same time), but she's just so narcissistic and stubborn, she never (or rarely) speaks without thinking first, that you can't help but put aside her best sides and focus on the tooth-cringing ones. Sometimes, she really lacks tact, not to mention good manners, and, for the most part, she walks around feeling like she invented the concept of being a badass. I’ve got news for you, Cece. You still have a lot of road ahead.So flipping frustrating.Sure, she had her good moments, I actually appreciated her spirit and braveness in many occasions, but they were rare and ephemeral enough that they couldn’t have overcome the flaws even if Batman himself joined the collab.I really hope she’ll redeem herself, or at least, grow some sense into that little superiority complex-affected brain of hers.To be completely honest, sometimes I even enjoyed this book, but I couldn't help but notice they were chapters or paragraphs in which Celeana was silent or absent or too busy fighting for her freedom to care about other stuff.Ahem, I'll leave the math to you, peeps.Bless the multi-pov option! I really didn’t mind at all those Dorian or Chaol chapters.And, yes, feel free to read this as: I really didn’t mind Dorian nor Chaol.Which brings us to the romance side.Guess what? There was a love triangle! *fakes shock* I know.So. Original. And. Unexpected.Even if Huey, Dewey, and Louie engaged in some sort of inevitable, twisted and confused love triangle, which I’ll never be a fan of, I still couldn’t care enough to let it bother me. Just give me some substance, I don’t care who sucks whose face.Now, at the question, do you ship Celeana with Dorian or Chaol, I'll reply: WHAT EVEN IS SHIPPING ANYMORE.Since, y'know, I think it'd too much to hope Dorian and Chaol will both dump Sardothien, grab a dozen puppies each, and ride their way into the sunset, together.The other characters didn’t really convince me that much (although no one got nearly on my nerves as Miss Main Character did), I felt like there could have been more work behind, just like the whole story didn’t exactly engage me from start to end for the very same reason.You can tell someone didn't really do their best at researching. The setting and the way all characters behave could have been a little more authentic, and, holy crow, theooc-ismwas too much, even for a mediocre book.Still, I think after a good 60%, both the writing and the plot really improve right before my eyes.I’m convinced, maybe, I would have loved this book better if I read it when it first came out.I have too high standards now. really, it's like a curse.I’ve never really followed SJM but I feel like I should give her another chance (brain screaming: I WANT MORE DORIAN AND CHAOL). I’ll try not to let it influence negatively my coming judgment and consider this book an isolated case, and also this series’ chance to prove how sometimes books can upgrade in reverse, and put some more hopes intoCrown of Midnight.Until then, two and a half stars are more than enough.ACTUAL RATINGS 2.5/5{update July 2021: while my opinion on this book hasn't changed at all (Throne of Glass was and still is a let down with insufferable characters and cringey writing) I wanted to make this little update to tell whoever will read this review that I ended up caving and I continued the series, and I'm glad I did, because it really does get better. The plot in particular. SJM stepped up her writing game and I also ended up liking celaena's character development. This to say, don't be surprised if you step upon another of my THG reviews and find it more positive than this one.

I heard it being sold as GRR Martin\'sGame of Throneswritten for the female audience --- well, as a female audience, I am offended. As an avid reader of the fantasy genre, I am saddened that this is marketed as a fantasy-for-females. Thisbeing a YA does not excuse it from being riddled with clichés, painfully obvious foreshadowing, and a ghost of a fantasy worldruthlessly overshadowed by romantic overtones.Fans of fantasy -actualfantasy - I don\'t suppose would much enjoyThrone of Glass, either. And even though the synopsis makes it soundHunger Games-esque, I\'m afraid on that front, you\'d be disappointed, too.I would say, if you enjoyedThe SelectionbyKiera Cass, but long for a lessself-abasingcharacter than America, then I think you might enjoyThrone of Glass.I must warn you:this review will be long, and most of it dedicated to a bit of a character study if anything; and whySarah J Maas failed at her character of an assassin. But let\'s start at the beginning.Celaena Sardothien has spent years in the death camps of Endovier, where she will ultimately spend the rest of her life. Until, that is, crown prince Dorian appoints her to enter in a competition for the title of King\'s Champion, who will be tasked to do the King\'s secret bidding. But when one by one, the competitors turn up dead, Celaena knows that something evil lurks the castle.Instead of the action-packed novel I was lead to believe I\'d be reading, all I got were ... balls and dances, and then some fight scenes are thrown in there just to make sure we don\'tforgetthat this is supposed to be a story of an assassin. No,Sarah J Maas, I hopeyoudon\'t forget what we came here for.When I say thatThrone of Glasslowers the standards of Fantasy, I mean that it doesn\'t seem to know much about its own setting.Royal Households everywhere, at every turn of the century, have a set of rules dictating things such as etiquette; what is proper and what isimproper. And these rules don\'t exist for the sake of it - there arereasonsbehind etiquette: to prevent affronting your peers, for instance. To prevent harmful court gossip. To prevent a crown prince from running around and fathering a thousand bastards before he is even dubbed King, creating more than enough future claimants to the throne.I assume the same applies inThrone of Glass; for instance thereareetiquettes mentioned that deem a prince dancing with only one partner something considerably rude.Soit threw me way out of time and placewhen I found out that Chaol, Captain of the Guards, would enter Celaena\'s chambers at any time of day he wishes - even when she\'s still dressed in her scanty nightgown.Even the Prince does this; visiting her whensoever he pleases. You may call me a prude, you may call me many anti-feminist names, but this is not acceptable. Not because I give two cents on what the court would say about Celaena; not that I give two cents whether or not the prince was copulating with her; butbecause this is simply not done. Especiallynotwithout repercussion, if even in the form of social stigma.Celaena had a maid waiting on her - but it seems that all she was good for was putting her clothes on. It wasChaolwho barged in her room, underdressed as she was, just to wake her up. He is aCaptain of the Guards. This should not even be his task!These small, ridiculousignorance of Royal Household etiquetteanddivision of labourmade it seem as if the whole thing was poorly researched. You may argue that this wasnotfeudal England; that this world was built entirely ofMaas\' imagination, but things such aslogicshould still apply. And when has iteverbeen logical for aCaptain of Guardsto be responsible for waking up guests? When has it ever beenacceptablefor a Prince to come and go, without repercussion, into a common girl\'s chambers?But that is exactly the problem withThrone of Glass.The entire premisewasn\'tlogical.By this I am of course talking about the King\'s competition.""(...) He\'s hosting a competition. He invited twenty-three members of his council to each sponsor a would-be Champion to train in the glass castle and ultimately compete in a duel.""... and this Champion of his is tasked ...To work for the King of Adarlan as his loyal servant. She raised her chin. To kill for him (...)But where is the logic fail?you ask me. Allow me to reiterate. He wants aloyalsubject to kill for him, without question, with the utmost secrecy. Yet he chooses thisloyal subjectthrough acompetition. Not only that, he makes hiscouncilmenchoose the competitors for him.I may not be a direct member of a royal family myself, but I know there are things such as courtintrigueandhidden agendasand hell, there are hundreds upon thousands of discrete allegiances and plots being made left, right and centre.Do youreallywant yourfuture, ""loyal"" Championto be handpicked out of a number ofcriminalsand entrusted to yourcouncilmen?The whole competition thing wasn\'t at all very thought through. In the end, it felt as if it was just there to get the story going, to get Celaena into the castle.The competition itself was a let downnstead of some fight-to-the-death (or similar) trope, we get ... a race. An archery competition. Wall-climbing. And a lot of others that happened off screen.Amidst all these competitions and training programs, the plot scattered into flirting banter, gatecrashing parties, and some girl-on-girl hating; as ifthe author wasn\'t quite sure whether she wanted her novel to be the story of a ruthless assassin, or the romances of a ruthless assassin princess-wannabe.And now I get to Celaena, the princess-wannabe. Allow me to present a number of quotes I\'ve highlighted:She loved clothes--loved the feeling of silk, of velvet, of satin, of suede and chiffon--and was fascinated by the grace of seams, the intricate perfection of an embossed surface. And when she won this ridiculous competition, when she was free ... she could buy all the clothes she wanted.*Everything was wet and half-frozen, and while she could bear sodden hair, she couldn\'t withstand the agony of wet shoes.*There were more Champions seated at the tables--even the pimply-faced Pelor sat near Chaol! A half-rate boy assassin! She bared her teeth. How dare she be denied an invitation to the feast?You read all that and tell me, do you imagine these thoughts coming from a renown, world-classassassin?An assasin complaining about her wet shoes?About not being invitedto a banquet?No. Two things strike me here: First,she had just spent years at adeath camp, but her behaviour upon leaving it did not portray any humility or gratefulness of being far away from all those whippings and forced labour. You\'d think she\'d just be glad to be away from the mines and pickaxe to becomplaining about wet shoesSMH.Second;this sounds more like something a ditzy princess-wannabe would say. Oh, after I win this competition,I\'m gonna buy myself some clothes. For someone who has spent years suffering, who spent her childhood being trained as a ruthless killer, she comes across sounding soprivileged.Now, I\'m not an assassin. I\'ve never beentrainedas one, but for years Ididgo through a whole series of martial arts before finding one that suited my small stature. And ofallmartial arts -- from karate to jiu-jitsu to wushu to the one I finally settled with -- there wasone thingwe were taught was the foundation of any great martial artist.Discipline.And I\'m sorry, Celaena. Butyou don\'t have it.This is her reaction tofailing at a game of pool:A shriek of rage ripped from her throat, and Celaena ran over to the pocket. She first screamed at the ball, then took the cue in her hands and bit down upon the shaft, still screaming through her clamped teeth. Finally the assassin stopped and slapped the three ball into the pocket.This is her discipline at training:""It\'s cold,"" she moaned, holding her knees to her body. She didn\'t care that she had only a few months to beat the other Champions--she needed sleep.""I\'m afraid it doesn\'t work that way; you don\'t get to tell me that this girl is an accomplished, feared assassin at the age of.... sixteen?.... buther entire mentality, her entirepersonalitydoes not ring true of an assassin.Do you think the realm\'s greatest killer would be afraid ofwalking in a glass house?""Only an idiot would walk in a house made of glass.""(...)The thought of standing on floors of glass made her queasy.....afraid ofheights?She had a terrible headache around her left temple. Everything was sickly and frail. They were so high up, so dangerously high ...Do you think they moan and whinge and complain at the drop of a hat?Once they\'d finished their run, they trained in a private room far from her competitor\'s eyes. Until, that is, she collapsed to the ground and cried that she was about to die of hunger and fatigue.*Celaena frowned at herself as she hurried after the captain into the foyer. ""I look ridiculous! These pants are absurd, and this shirt is awful.""For heaven\'s sake, you\'re an assassin, not a supermodel. No. Discipline doesn\'t just mean getting up every morning and training every day. It also means adiscipline of the mind. It means self-restraint. It means keeping your head low. What kind of assassinwantsto be the centre of attention?? To have her skills known?? If you want glory, then you\'re in the wrong career path. Be a damned knight.But Celaena isvainandself-absorbed. Shewants to be in the spotlight.""I hate all these guards and nonsense; I hate you telling me to hold back when Brullo sings Cain\'s praises and I\'m just there, boring and unnoticed in the middle.""*""Do you know how insulting it is to pretend to be some nobody thief from a small city in Fenharrow?""Not only that, but she\'s also very contradictory and hypocritical:What was a ""Champion"" but a dressed-up name for murderer? Could she actually stomach working for him?And I suppose ""assassin"" is just a synonym for mercy-killer? But enough of her faults.Let\'s take a look at her more positive attributes.She\'s beautiful. In factsobeautiful that she drains the blood out of peoplewho sees her:Celaena smiled smugly to herself as she nodded to a passing noble-man, who raised his eyebrows at the sight of her. He was immensely pale, she noticed as he opened his mouth to say something, but Celaena continued down the hall.In factsobeautiful that other ladies envy her and she has to shove that in their facesbecause you can\'t have a YA novel without other girls being envious of our heroine!:She smiled at the young chevaliers as they passed--and smirked at the court women who eyed her pink-and-white gown. She couldn\'t blame them; the dress was spectacular. And she was spectacular in it. Even Redd, one of the handsomer guards posted outside her rooms, had said so.Also shallow, as it seems, because if Reddhadn\'tbeen handsome, his opinion wouldn\'t have mattered, right?Still not convinced that she\'s shallow?Why did Chaol never joke with her as Dorian did? Perhaps he truly didn\'t find her attractive. The possibility of it stung more than she would have liked.You see,because people can only like you if you\'reattractive. Oh, sorry, I got sidetracked. We were talking over herpositiveattributes. Well, she\'s a great dancer:She didn\'t falter a single step, nor did she seem to care about the many angry female faces that watched as dance after dance passed and they didn\'t switch partners.She also plays ameanpianobecause music is like, the way we show just how deep and artistic our heroine is:Celaena eyed the pianoforte. She used to play--oh, she\'d loved to play, loved music(...)Shelovesdogsbecause that\'s how we know she\'s a kind-hearted person. No evil person is an animal lover!:""Of course I want her,"" Celaena said, then realized what the implications would be. ""But I want her trained. I don\'t want her urinating on everything and chewing on furniture and shows and books. And I want her to sit when I tell her to and lay down and roll over (...)Oh, but she doesn\'t want to beinconveniencedso she doesn\'t want totrain it herselfof course! She speaks foreign languages,and!just so we canallrelate to her-- she also loves books!I could go on andpoint out her inconsistencies, but this is getting much too long for my liking. In short,Celaena Sardothien is a Mary Sue. But even worse --she is anunlikeable, vain, shallow, self-centred Mary Sue. And if you expect me to believe she\'s a deadly killer, then you better think again.But that is the final problem I had with this book -- the narratorconstantlytells us what to believe.There was something great and deadly concealed within her, and he didn\'t like it.while moments later, she\'s rolling on the ground, crying and whinging that she\'s gonna die of starvation. Yeah, no.Also,""Because it looks like he\'s in love with her,"" he said, and walked away.(...) His shoulders were straight, his back erect. He looked like a man. Like a king.Yeah, if you say so.But,you say to me,there must besomethingyou liked?Well, Ididlike Celaena\'s relationship with the err, Indian princess. I forgot her name. Because I didn\'t like the actual princess herself -- she doesn\'t know tact. She doesn\'t know diplomacy. She comes to a foreign realm and all she does is whinge and insult their language and clothes and court.So, no. I didn\'t like the plot, I didn\'t like the characters. The only stars go to Chaol for being a beacon of sanity amidst all the awfulness. It\'s a pity he, too, fell for our Mary Sue.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '""I swear on my crown that the pup shall live.""The five Throne of Glass novellas did a great job convincing me to push toward the main series. I mean what\'s not to like: A mysterious new world, a set of interesting characters (in novellas) and a lot of potential plot-lines to explore. But, after reading this first book, the only reason I\'m rounding up what felt like a 2.5-star read to 3-star (instead of 2) is, me not belonging in the intended audience. But even for a young audience, I believe some of the stuff here are too shallow and rudimentary, especially in the first half of the book.Though it wasn\'t much original, I still found the plot to be interesting. The unfairly convicted protagonist trying to make a change by fighting on multiple fronts, and some politics to keep things heated among characters, while adding a bit of dark magic to have a little mysteriousness. Story starts with Celaena being conditionally released from prison, to participate in a competition which expects to select a champion for the king. I was under the impression that this competition would be the main plotline, but it was mostly on sidelines. Politics played a major part, and I think that\'s what I enjoyed the most here. As for magic, there wasn\'t a whole lot of revelations in this one, however I\'m hoping everything would become clear in time. But after a few chapters, it quickly becomes apparent that the main theme here is romance. Everything revolves around Dorian - Celaena - Chaol trio, and leading up to a too obvious love triangle. But at least, it\'s not one of those terrible ones, where one of the three being a complete villain. The pace of the story was also okay, and even though the book wasn\'t much impactful, it was kind of a fun read overall. But the prose has a lot of room to improve, especially by moving beyond the pure melodramatic conversation.However, I have to admit, it did get better towards the end. Even though the villain turned out to be the obvious one, I loved the detailed final battle, until the very end.From the very first page, I didn\'t expect much from Celaena. It was clear from the novellas, aside from being fun, she had a number of conflicting traits, and was not very congruous with being an infamous assassin. Trying to squeeze in this many qualities to a single character is hardly a good idea, even if the character is of an age suit to be full of wisdom, and experience. But when you try that with an eighteen year old girl, who is the definition of impulsiveness, it is not surprising that the character turning out to be an annoyance. Even if the author had intended to create a strong role model for readers of the intended audience, I think the character came out looking too shallow, and inconsistent. I\'m not giving examples to avoid spoilers, but one does not have to look deep to find her shortcomings. Celaena might be a very popular character but she is anything but a role-model in my opinion.If it wasn\'t for the novellas, I probably would not have finished this book. And even with the novellas, I still might\'ve discontinued, if it wasn\'t for the shared opinion among many that first couple of books being the weakest in the series. I hope, at least in time, these qualities would fade away. At this point, I cannot say that I liked the prose that much either, but I\'m hoping that\'d improve as well.""So, I highly suggest, Miss Sardothien, that you get your arrogance in check.""'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'This book was sooooo goood!

She was taken from Endovier (the death camp) and brought to the castle to fight with other Champions. If she wins then she has to kill for the King for 4 years and then she is free. I have a feeling that\'s not to be. Prince Dorian is the one that chose her as his champion to fight against the others. Celaena is being called Lady Lillian because they don\'t want anyone to know who she is, since she is a bad @ssed assassin.I loved and still to this day love Chaol. But, I never liked the fact that Dorian and Celaena shared a few kisses. Ewww, I just don\'t like Dorian that way. He\'s like a best boy friend. I do love that he gave Celaena a dog she named, Fleetfoot =)I mean Calaena loves books and dogs and she\'s an assassin. How awesome is that. Oh, and the part where Prince Dorian picked up one of the steamy books she had been reading. Lol""Sunset\'s Passions,"" he read, and opened the book to a random page to read aloud. "" \'His hands gently caressed her ivory, silky br---\' "" His eyes widened. ""By the Wyrd! Do you actually read this rubbish?

I\'m glad they were friends.But . . something is killing off the champions in very narly ways. We do finally find out what it is and it just figures. That\'s all I\'m going to say.I loathed Cain, one of the champions, and Kaltain, an evil woman that was up to no good as well.I loved Nehemia, she\'s from another kingdom and there for her own reasons.

Maas! This is a very popular series. An extremely popular series, an exceptionally hyped up series, a tremendouslyOLD AF SERIES. Listen to me here, if I were a fantasy fan when I was a teenager, I would have definitely read this book. But you know, my relationship with fantasy hasn\'t been lit for the last2583 years, so I hadn\'t picked it up. I started loving fantasy again this year because ofA Court of Thorns and Roses, a book I bought because I needed it for my uni thesis, not because I was interested in reading fantasy again.SO YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH WORK I GOT WITH FANTASY BOOKS. I haven\'t read fantasy since 2010. I have a million fantasy series to catch up to. I\'m nervous.I WANT TO READ ALL THE FANTASY NOW AND NOTHING BUT FANTASY.ANYWAY, LET\'S TALK ABOUT THIS BOOK.After serving out a year of hard labor in the salt mines of Endovier for her crimes, 18-year-old assassin Celaena Sardothien is dragged before the Crown Prince. Prince Dorian offers her her freedom on one condition: she must act as his champion in a competition to find a new royal assassin.Her opponents are men-thieves and assassins and warriors from across the empire, each sponsored by a member of the king\'s council. If she beats her opponents in a series of eliminations, she\'ll serve the kingdom for four years and then be granted her freedom. Celaena finds her training sessions with the captain of the guard, Westfall, challenging and exhilarating. But she\'s bored stiff by court life. Things get a little more interesting when the prince starts to show interest in her ... but it\'s the gruff Captain Westfall who seems to understand her best.Then one of the other contestants turns up dead ... quickly followed by another. Can Celaena figure out who the killer is before she becomes a victim? As the young assassin investigates, her search leads her to discover a greater destiny than she could possibly have imagined.I had very high expectations for this book which were partially met. As I said before, my firstSarah J. Maasbook isA Court of Thorns and Roses, which is the her latest series. Most of you have readThrone of Glassfirst and thenA Court of Thorns and Roses, and you have experienced her writing flourish. I haven\'t. I read her better book first. I can see now that she has improved so much, her writing is so much better now. Some things in the writing of this book weren\'t my thing, like repetitions of some phrases, ""assassin"" being referred to Celaena the whole entire time (which bugged me a bit), poor choice of words at some parts. But I recognized Sarah in this book. I can recognize her writing style now, and I truly love it.This book gave me suchGame of ThronesandHarry Potter and the Goblet of Firevibes! From the badass main character with the hard to pronounce name which reminded me ofDaenerys Targaryento the championship which was like theTriwizard TournamentinGoblet of Fire, the vibes were fucking lit yo! The worldSarah J. Maashas created in this book was so immersive, I was so into it when I was reading the book. I wasn\'t even confused with all the names and places and words, it all came natural to me. I can see how after this book, the world will expand to an enormous extend with magic and Fae and so many new characters appearing, and I\'m here for it!The multiple character perspectives was a surprise to me. Celaena owns the most chapters, but we can see things told from mostly all the characters, (even the fucking King) which is something I was surprised about as it does not happen in her other series. I loved it. This is what I missed from theA Court of Thorns and Rosesseries. The multiple character POVs. And I relish in the fact that we can explore things from numerous viewpoints.CELAENA GUYS. CELAENA SARDOTHIEN. I LOVE YOU TO THE MOON AND BACK. I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY AND FIND THE BEST MATCH FOR YOU AND UNDERSTAND YOUR PAST AND YOUR LINEAGE AND BASICALLY CONTINUE TO BE A BADASS QUEEN. I didn\'t expect her character to be like this, to be honest. The book description suggested a ruthless, cold-hearted killer, and I expected as much. But her compassion and her kindness and her passion for multiple things showed from the very first pages. She is a merciless assassin who can end you with a snap of her finger but she has also kept her personality. Her humor, her quirkiness. She loves beautiful dresses, she loves to eat good food, puppies 🐶, and she loves books.SHE IS A READER GUYS. I absolutelyADOREwhen book characters are readers. Especially in fantasy. I can relate to them so much easier.I immensely appreciated her friendship with Nehemia and that it wasn\'t ruined at the end. I was so scared about this. I loathe when they make female characters hate each other in books, especially about a love interest! Just don\'t, please.Girls need to stick together!I want to see more of her in the future books. I\'m sure we will, but it was left kind of wonky in this book. I suspected her too, in the middle of the book, and I was certain it was her, orchestrating everything. But it was Cain. The obvious choice. It was anticlimactic, to be totally honest. I wanted it to be someone else. We all expected Cain, and it was Cain. I didn\'t believe it would be him, I was certain there would be a plot twist, at the end, or something. But no.AND NOWWWWWWthe romance. I love both Dorian and Chaol, both for different reasons. I\'m so fond of the relationships Celaena holds with both of them. They\'re so different, and yet they both mean so much to her.I SHIPPED BOTH THOSE SHIPS THROUGHOUT THIS BOOK.But I lean like 51% on Dorian. Their scenes were cuter, and I think they have more things in common. Their passion for books, the billiard scenes, the music scene,THE FUCKING PUPPY, the dance, the kisses, the candy. They made me feels so many things! And then we have scenes with Chaol and I was back in that train again.COME ON CELAENA, DARLING, JUST CHOOSE. I will choose for you, but for myself. I have no problem with that, sweetie 😉 I was conflicted about her train of thought, to be frank. The one moment she found Dorian extremely attractive and she wanted to kiss him, and the next she found Chaol handsome and she wanted to spend more and more time with him. I was as much confused as she is. But I\'m delighted that the author didn\'t make the romance the main part of the book. She didn\'t portray Celaena as a character who depends on a man to save her, or to make her feels special or anything alike. She would have been fine without them as love interests in her life. Furthermore, I have to talk about Nox. What a sweetheart. What a wasted opportunity on a character. We basically saw nothing of him. I thought he was gonna be a third love interest in the beginning and I was like""WOAH WOAH THERE SARAH HON SLOW DOWN""but luckily he wasn\'t. But I kept thinking about his character.YOU\'RE THE TRUE AND UNDOUBTFUL EPITOME OF THE WORD ""FRIENDZONE"". I hope we see him again.The final battle... oh man. It dragged more than it should, to be honest, but it was breathtaking. Sarah knows how to write a good jaw-dropping ending. There was so much information throughout this whole battle, that I had to reread some parts to totally grasp what was going on. It was so intense and magical and out of this world. I was so proud of myGIRLfor still being strong and trying to fight even though she was drugged. She made me believe, at some parts, that she would win. Kaltain. UGH. May we never see this bitch again. I WAS SO HAPPY WHEN WE FOUND OUT THE DUKE WAS SCHEMING BEHIND HER BACK ALL ALONG. I know we will see her again, but fuck her. I don\'t want to see her lying ass point of view again.To sum it all up, this was a pretty strong beginning to a series. I only gave it4 starsbecause it didn\'t overwhelm me. I keep comparing it to A Court of Thorns and Roses, which is like my favorite series, at the moment. I can\'t stop comparing these two series, damn it. But I loved it nonetheless and I\'m waiting for the next book,Crown of Midnight, to arrive. I\'m actually pretty excited, cause I have heard these books get so much better. and I can already see that. So till the next one... K BYE!!'}]"

But I can't risk losing this job – not if I want to keep my darkest secret safe . . .It's hard to find an employer who doesn't ask too many questions about my past. So I thank my lucky stars that the Garricks miraculously give me a job, cleaning their stunning penthouse with views across the city and preparing fancy meals in their shiny kitchen. I can work here for a while, stay quiet until I get what I want. It's almost perfect. But I still haven't met Mrs Garrick, or seen inside the guest bedroom. I'm sure I hear her crying. I notice spots of blood around the neck of her white nightgowns when I'm doing laundry. And one day I can't help but knock on the door. When it gently swings open, what I see inside changes everything...That's when I make a promise. After all, I've done this before. I can protect Mrs. Garrick while keeping my own secrets locked up safe. Douglas Garrick has done wrong. He is going to pay. It's simply a question of how far I'm willing to go...","[{'rating': 4, 'content': ""In a Nutshell:The good news is that this is just like ‘The Housemaid.’ The bad news is that this is just like ‘The Housemaid.’ A fun thriller, as long as you don’t overanalyse it. Better if you read the series in order.Story Synopsis:Millie is back, still working as a maid, and still struggling for finances. She is in a steady relationship with Brock, a lawyer who doesn’t know anything about her past. Not that she loves Brock, but as Enzo isn’t around, he will do.After Millie loses her current job, she gets a call from Douglas Garrick, a wealthy tech specialist. He wants Millie to clean and cook, but on one condition|: she is NOT to interact with his wife Wendy, who is ill. As Millie is desperate for a job, she agrees. However, things are, but obviously, not as declared, and Millie finds herself in a quandary; risk her job by helping Wendy, or go against her values by ignoring what’s happening?The book comes to us in the first person perspective of two of the characters, one being Millie.This sequel doesn't exactly continue from the end of the first novel, but provides enough of context to help us bridge to the events of this book. Though this can work as a standalone, I recommend you read the series in order, because Millie’s personality is much better explored in the first book.Since I complain about Bookouture blurbs quite often (Sorry, Bookouture! I still love you though!), I think I should also give them credit when they nail the task. The blurb of this book is spot on, revealing just as much as needed and creating enough interest without spoiling the fun or misleading. Good job!On the pro side, the story has every positive element that was present in the earlier book:👉 Quick-paced writing.👉 A storyline that keeps you invested even when you know what’s to come (or so you think.)👉 An intriguing prologue.👉 Characters who say one thing and do something else.👉 Twists – some foreseeable, some out of the blue.👉 Some funny moments, courtesy Millie’s snide remarks in her first person pov.👉 An ending that works well for the story.On the flip side,⚠ The pattern of the book is exactly the same as the first book. (And many other thrillers.) So the minute the prologue began, I knew it was not narrated by whom we would assume it to be. The appearance of the second character’s pov created a huge déjà vu moment, as I knew it would contradict everything Millie had told us so far. I was still interested in the proceedings; it is just that instead of enjoying the story as a fresh tale, I found myself playing detective and figuring out the twists based on the similarity to the first book.⚠ Millie didn’t endear herself to me this time around. Her attitude towards Brock was quite irksome, and her thoughts very repetitive. While she shows her true spirit by the end, I wish it had been more evident throughout.⚠ The writing is also somewhat basic, though, to be honest, I don’t read a thriller for its prose. But the overdose of foreshadowing and the back-and-forth rambling by Millie were somewhat disappointing.All in all, this is still gripping enough to provide an entertaining ride. I liked the first book much better as it had plenty of dark undertones. This one offers standard fare in comparison.I finally have the chance to use a phrase so many of my reviewer-friends do: it’s a popcorn thriller! Treat it as such than as a literary classic. As long as you read it with your logical side kept aside, you can have fun with it.3.5 stars, rounding up as it allowed me to complete it within a day.My thanks to Bookouture and NetGalley for the DRC of “The Housemaid's Secret”.

Clunky, repetitive writing. Cringey dialogue. Predictable plot with a “twisty” part 2 retelling the same boring story from another perspective. Skip this.(( SPOILERS BELOW ))................................(( SPOILERS AHEAD ))....................(( LAST CALL - SPOILERS ARE COMING ))..............................(( HERE ARE THE SPOILERS ))..........After the events of The Housemaid, our girl Millie has earned a reputation among rich white ladies as someone who can take care of business (ie help them get away from their shitty husbands AND clean their houses and babysit - she’s the full package). Despite all of her Good Samaritan-ism to the uber-wealthy (because who needs help more than the 1%?), Millie is still super poor and struggling. So poor that she is forced to live in the South Bronx! THE SOUTH BRONX!Millie’s hot Italian groundskeeper boyfriend and Samaritanizing associate Enzo has a-gone-a back-a to-a Sicily to a-take-a care of his a-dying mama so Millie is living alone in her SOUTH BRONX apartment. But she has inexplicably scored herself a super hot and rich and nice lawyer boyfriend named Brock (which, side note: omfg don’t name a character BROCK, unless he’s, you know, a rapist swimmer douchebag), who loves her soooooo much and wants her to move into his swanky apartment OVERLOOKING CENTRAL PARK because he’s ready to settle down because of his heart condition (?) even though they’ve only been dating for six months and Millie stands him up constantly and doesn’t seem to even remotely like him as anything other than an abstract concept. She also hasn’t told him about her past, but really, really means to, eventually. But until then, she’ll just act shady AF and keep skipping their dates. Sounds like a solid plan.Millie gets a new job cleaning for another super-rich couple, Douglas & Wendy Garrick, who live in a fancy PENTHOUSE APARTMENT on the UPPER WEST SIDE, JUST WEST OF CENTRAL PARK which is super different from her poor person neighborhood (the SOUTH BRONX in case you’ve forgotten). Douglas seems vaguely hot-ish in a rich guy way, but Wendy stays hidden away in a guest room. Uh-oh.Then Millie thinks she’s being followed and she gets attacked by her skeezy neighbor dude (in the stairwell of her apartment in the SOUTH BRONX) and she stands up Brock a few more times and buys some weird rich people groceries for the Garricks. Then she sees Wendy with a busted up face and at some point Millie gets Wendy out of the PENTHOUSE APARTMENT ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE and to a cheap motel that is even worse than the SOUTH BRONX, but Douglas finds her and brings her back to the PENTHOUSE APARTMENT and continues to escalate the abuse.Then it turns out the person following Millie is none other than-a Enzo! He’s-a back-a from-a Italy and his mom is dead so he thought stalking Millie was the best plan to restart their relationship. He calls Brock “Broccoli” 197 times, and it was funny-ish the first time, but it got old real quick, and his accent a-comes and a-gos and he speaks grammatically perfectly for a few sentences and then-a goes-a back-a to not understanding English. It’s a real-a rollercoaster.Anyway, the two of them hatch a plan to save Wendy. Blah blah some stuff happens and Millie shoots Douglas and he’s dead.But.Then.The twist.The dude Millie shot is not Douglas! The real Douglas is a schlubby goober and not the handsome-ish man Millie killed. Oh dear.So then we have part 2, told from Wendy’s perspective. Turns out, Wendy is a gold-digging skank who only married schlubby Real Douglas for his money. She has an affair with Fake Douglas, who is married to Real Douglas’s secretary, Marybeth. Wendy and Fake Douglas make a plan to kill Real Douglas for his money… and to frame Millie for his murder, which really seems like a lot of trouble to go through.Jesus H. Ok. So, the gun Millie shot was full of blanks. Fake Douglas was fake dead, so then Wendy killed Real Douglas and made him real dead. Millie hides from the police because they are after her. Wendy and Fake Douglas go to his wife Marybeth’s remote cabin to hide out and do some hot-tubbing, but then a very angry Marybeth shows up and Fake Douglas gets his throat slit (!!) and Wendy gets killed with digoxin heart pills and is forced to write a suicide note explaining everything, so now Millie is off the hook. Yay.Then we jump ahead a few months, and Enzo is muscularly moving into Millie’s SOUTH BRONX apartment, and then Broccoli shows up to to pick up a box of his shit, and I guess it’s another twist that Millie gave Broccoli’s heart pills to Marybeth and that’s what killed Wendy.So, now Enzo and Millie live together in the SOUTH BRONX, and I guess she’ll find another cleaning job? Sigh.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""2.5 starsThat was... interesting.Not as good as the first book, that's for sure.It started off slow with not much happening in the first 30% of the book. It seems very similar to the first book in the beginning. Things started picking up around 50% of the book with the thriller genre coming in to play massively and since then, couldn't help but binge. Thetwists and turnsup till part 2 are really interesting and then it went downhill for me.After part 2the issues I had were all because of the two female characters.Am sorry as good asMilliewas in the first one, she is SO ANNOYING in this one. The fact she keeps on using Brock??? Like girl just stop please. I feel so bad for him throughout the book. If you don't want someone or don't love someone, just let them go!! Her inner monologues are so repetitive.Then comesWendy,I HATED her so much. She is such a narcissist, all I wanted was Douglas to just tell her her reality and find a life of his own. I wouldn't even mind if her pathetic little gold digging arse got killed off in a brutal manner. What she got was so mild compared to what she deserved.*insert multiple swear words here*Theendingwas underwhelming. The men in this book deserved better!! All four of them!!I for sure recommend book 1. Book 2? Not so much.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4.5 ❤️🍾Tylko dlatego nie pięć gwiazdek, że pierwszy tom mnie wziął z totalnego zaskoczenia, a teraz już wiem, jak świetnie Freida McFadden konstruuje swoje książki, więc nie przeżyłam już takiego szoku jak przy „Pomocy domowej” ❤️ Co nie zmienia faktu, że to są absolutnie wybitne kryminały.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""3.95!A RANT AT THE END‼️This book was so intense!! Like UFFF I was in the edge of my seat and I would be lying If I said that I didn't enjoy it because I did. It kept me hooked throughout, so I have to praise freida for that atleast and the plot for this one was really well thought. I liked how everything was set up and how everything wrapped up. However, there were some plotlines that were weak but I would say I liked how strong part 1&2 were even part 3 till it's middle but from there onwards it started to go spiraling down.Millie was very annoying here. Too nosy for her own good and treated her bf like shit who was nothing but good to hear and had the audacity at the end to say that he left her when she needed her the most while she wasn't even present for most of their relationship, this part of Millie's actions was so infuriating but her being nosy and extra curious while working for Douglas was actually very smart from Freida's part because it completely took my attention from one thing and i broke my one rule 😭 but anyways, I enjoyed reading abiut Millie and by the end I didnt mind her being annoyingly curious or nosy because it served a purpose but the way she treated broc 🙄🙄 bffr Millie, bffr.As for the plot, I think Freida did a really good job at some parts especially the twist because I was not expecting that and I did enjoy it a lot but I found the start to be a little slow and part 4 to be very underwhelming and there was one thing that I'll discuss below that made no sense to me but other than that I liked the whole story.SPOILERS‼️So my one rule about reading thrillers is the first suspect is never the culprit and I broke it here 😭😭 by suspecting Douglas and hey I have to blame Millie's annoying nature because iw as so annoyed at her being nosy and all and with how Wendy (what a bitch tbh) and her constant gaslighting that I thought it was really Douglas 😭😭💀 until part two 💀 where my jaw was literally hanging on the floor. Wendy was one twisted woman like she was so insecure and tried to justify so many of her actions and pls the way she murdered Douglas at the end like 😭 my man just wanted to live a happy life but no you were too greedy and were trying to be so posh 🙄 like stfu bitch anyways, Wendy got what she deserved but hats off to her for orchestrating everything also her audacity to cheat and destroy another marriage?? 😭 Wow. Loved Douglasbecuase he had two balls and one brain to actually exclude Wendy entirely from the will. Now see this part one and two which was amazing but then comes part three where everything was not that much drawn out and then we get to the resolution and??? How??? Why??? Myrcabeth? Was that her name? It made no sense how a secretary managed to slit her husband's throat and also kill Wendy because 😭 like ik they both were having an affair but still it was so out of the blue and I didn't like it that much, it didn't feel satisfying. I also DO NOT understand like this made ZERO SENSE to me how when myrcabeth (wtv her name is) was making Wendy write a letter where she confessed to framing Millie and where she accused her of killing her husband and also herself, I didn't understand why she didn't say no because that way Wendy may have had a chance to escape or take down both millie and myrcabeth like why would she write that she was attempting to kill herself knowing that myrcabeth would kill her 😭😭😭 where she could bribe her way out or take them with her. It baffled me and that's what made lower my rating to a three.SPOILERS END‼️Overall, I had sm fun with it but the last part sucked.___Let's see where Millie ventures off to here...👀""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3.0 stars. After loving everything but the ending of “The Housemaid”I dove right into the sequel “The Housemaid’s Secret.” Although I always enjoy Ms. McFadden’s fast paced writing style, I didn’t enjoy “Secret” near as much as its predecessor. The primary distinction between the two books, in my opinion, was the tone of the book. “Secret” seemed to be written in a tounge-in-cheek style that began to grate on my nerves the more I read. For instance, at the very beginning of the book Millie gets fired from her job because the baby she was the caretaker for called her mommy in front of the baby’s real mother. It was written so over the top I couldn’t believe the author wanted me to believe this was a real scene in the book. Many other scenes (even ones depicting violent acts) were written so unrealistically, I never became invested in any of the characters. Because of the tone I would rate the book as just average even if I was able to fly through it. At times it felt like I was reading an early rough draft of the novel as the scenes were described in a bare bones style that were over before they could build any suspense. I never felt this way about “The Housemaid.” As you could probably tell from my very disjointed review, I had the hardest time explaining what I didn’t like about the book. The whimsical writing style on what could have been a great sequel to a great book left me unimpressed. I will definitely read Ms. McFadden again because admittedly her books are never boring and I’ve never had an issue with the tone of her books as it relates to the story before. Please be kind in your comments when you tell me how delusional I am in not liking the sequel as well as “ The Housemaid.”'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Book Two3.5 🍿STARSMillie is back and cleaning for a new wealthy couple,the Garricks. They live in a super swanky neighborhood in Manhattan, the Penthouse no less!It appears to be perfect, not a speck of dust in sight. There is one room that she won\'t be cleaning though. Wendy Garrick is behind closed doors, recovering from an illness.Millie discovers more than she was prepared for and makes a swift decision regarding Wendy.This was an entertaining popcorn read. Seasoned thriller readers may want less ""telling of the plot"" and more discovering of the reveal (at least i did), but we still get some major twists, a nail in the coffin moment and a lifetime movie end. Thunder and lightening included!! ⛈️⚡If you enjoyed book one or are a fan of the author, I think you\'ll enjoy this one too. I like the characters Millie and Enzo and would read more featuring them.Thanks to Netgalley for my arc. OUT February 2023'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""“The Housemaid's Secret” by Freida McFadden is another classic psychological thriller that will have everyone talking about it in 2023. A little backstory, “The Housemaid” was the first novel I read by her and I was instantly hooked. She is an exceptional author as I’ve read some of her other books as well but I was anxiously waiting for the sequel to “The Housemaid” because it was one of the best novels I read in 2022.Now, before I jump into my review, I want to let you all know about two trigger warnings in case they could affect you while reading. McFadden does a phenomenal job not describing anything in any kind of detail which is great but there are insinuations of violence against women and self-harm. Again, nothing is too detailed or graphic, just insinuated so I wanted to give everyone a heads-up about that. McFadden gets major props from me for not going into any specifics in both potential trigger warnings.I was very happy to get right back into what is going on with the main protagonist Millie since the ending to “The Housemaid” was pretty wild. Millie is awesome and I truly loved all the New York vibes in this novel. Being born and raised in Queens, NY, I loved all the references, especially to the NY Mets. It just felt so authentic and added another layer of immersion to this novel for me being a New Yorker and all.Besides that, all the little references to the first book in this series were also brilliantly done. I’d recommend reading the first one and then jumping right into this one to see what I mean. McFadden is a great storyteller that delivers some incredible suspense, mystery, tension, and my goodness, her plot twists are on a whole other level. She’s fantastic when it comes to them and they will literally have your jaw on the floor with how crazy they are once revealed. That’s exactly what happened to me and I still can’t believe them.This sequel delivers in ways only McFadden can conjure as it’s another incredible psychological thriller of a read. I love how all of her books are so fast-paced and addictive, you simply can’t put them down even if you tried. Her writing is so seamless that this novel was a genuine page-turner, especially when you get to the second half towards a crazy ending I never saw coming. Seriously, I’m still completely blown away by the ending.I give “The Housemaid's Secret” by Freida McFadden a perfect 5/5 as it’s another amazing novel by her that I’d highly recommend to anyone that wants a wild psychological thriller with crazy plot twists, mystery, and an incredible reading experience. McFadden is truly making a name for herself and I look forward to reading every single thing she’s written and all her future novels. She’s that magnificent and is an author I look forward to reading for many years to come.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""After thoroughly enjoying the first installment, I eagerly dove into this book, hungry for another whirlwind adventure in the world of Millie the maid. I can't help but keep my hopes high for the next installment, perhaps one where we follow Millie the social worker, assisting individuals caught in tumultuous relationships and dealing with dangerous spouses who mistreat their significant others. Personally, I'd love to see the narrative shift to focus on a husband's perspective in the second half of the book.I've come across several comments stating that the second book doesn't quite match the excellence of the first. However, I don't entirely agree with this sentiment. There are still incredible twists in this book that caught me off guard—not just one, but three brilliantly executed twists that took me by surprise. The first twist, while slightly more apparent, is not due to the author giving it away but rather because the book's concept encourages readers to think outside the box, fostering doubts about everyone's motives and leading us to suspect every move made by the other characters, all in an attempt to deceive us (or perhaps not-so-poor Millie, who retains her big heart to help others).In this new book, we find ourselves nearly five years ahead, witnessing the developments in Millie's life.At the end of the first book, she embarks on a journey to work in special homes, thanks to the highly-regarded references from Nina. Her mission is to aid housewives who have endured abuse at the hands of their husbands.Yet, within a few years, it appears that Millie has distanced herself from this perilous business. She particularly feels the void left by her partner in crime and her lover, Enzo, who had provided crucial resources to help abused women. Enzo's abrupt departure to Sicily to care for his ailing mother, coupled with his reluctance to specify when he'll return, leads to an amicable parting of ways. Millie begins dating Brock, a kind and caring lawyer with a critical heart condition who is eager to tie the knot soon. She also juggles cleaning and nannying jobs that come her way through word-of-mouth recommendations. Furthermore, she embarks on a journey to become a more effective social worker by enrolling in social psychology classes at a community college to better assist those in need.However, her latest gig ends abruptly when a misunderstanding with a child results in Millie being mistaken for the child's mother. The child's self-centered biological mother takes offense, leading to Millie's dismissal. Faced with no other options and fortunately without the need to move in with Brock (not broccoli), Millie manages to secure a promising job at the last minute. Douglas Garrick, a wealthy and influential business magnate, hires her to maintain his sprawling duplex penthouse, which he shares with his wife. Unfortunately, his wife's severe health condition confines her to her room for the majority of the day. The penthouse is largely spotless, with minimal chores for Millie—dusting, laundry, and preparing meals from recipes featuring obscure ingredients she's never encountered before. However, the pay and conditions are too tempting to refuse, and as the saying goes, beggars can't be choosers.Millie's plan is simple: follow her employers' instructions and avoid getting entangled in any family drama. But when she stumbles upon bloodstains in the bathroom and uncovers the reason for Wendy Garrick's seclusion—a battered and bruised face—her anger ignites. Despite the faint warning voice urging her to stay away from the family's issues, Millie can't resist intervening. Wendy Garrick, trapped with a monstrous husband, desperately needs saving, and Millie is determined to do everything in her power to rescue her. However, this time, the villain she confronts may prove to be more formidable than she ever imagined. To make matters worse, a relentless stalker is watching her every move. Is this threat connected to the Garrick family, or is something even more sinister lurking in the shadows, poised to threaten her life?Anticipating the big twist due to the first book's concept, I found the execution of these twists to be incredibly clever, with certain aspects even surpassing those in the first book. Upon finishing the book in a single sitting, I was so close to screaming and demanding another installment! I'm keeping my fingers tightly crossed that Freida McFadden won't keep us waiting too long for the next dance—or perhaps many more dances—in Millie's thrilling adventures. These books have become my new addiction, and I wholeheartedly recommend them to any reader in search of riveting, exhilarating, and breathtaking page-turners.I'm upgrading my rating from 4.5 stars to a solid 5, thanks to the clever twists, and eagerly looking forward to delving into more of the author's twisted tales sooner rather than later.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Dare I say that I liked this book more than The Housemaid?! Once again, McFadden delivered with some mindless entertainment (if you’re looking for a literary masterpiece, this isn’t the book). I was kept turning the pages, and not seeing all the different twists coming (like I did in the previous book).A brief summary… Our favorite housemaid, Millie returns to work for the very wealthy Garrick household. Douglas Garrick seems to be a nice man, but his wife Wendy does not leave the guest room. This seems very odd to Millie, and some strange occurrences start to take place.Once again, is Millie imagining things? Is Millie overstepping her boundaries once again? And why does she feel that someone has been following her? Don’t worry- all will be revealed with some surprising twists!Yes, there were a few discrepancies that I caught while reading this (but who’s counting, 😉), so I’m going with 4.5 stars rounded up. I will say that I do hope we see Millie again in a third book 🤞. I will also be cutting this review short as I plan on doing some cleaning up of my own 🧹🧽🪣I also recommend both The Housemaid and The Housemaid’s Secret as they are fun, entertaining, thrilling reads! Happy Reading my friends!'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '★3.75 stars""It all started with a simple cleaning job. And now it might end with my blood being mopped off the cabin floor"".I devoured this book in about 5 hours and if there\'s one author that can keep my attention like that, it\'s Freida McFadden. I disliked nearly every character in this book and that\'s how you know she can write wicked and complex characters.Millie is still naive and I wasn\'t expecting the story to go the path it did following the first book. I was expecting more of a ""vigilante style"" storyline than victim.

Freida McFadden has shown she can engage readers with suspenseful and surprising plots. The author followed the same formula here, but I didn't find it as compelling as the first book. The characters were mainly unlikeable, except for Brock (Brocolli). I found myself feeling sorry for the way Millie treated him. She needed someone more exciting and considered him boring and too predictable.Millie has a great deal of sympathy for abused women and will do anything to ensure they escape from harmful situations and by using any means necessary. Unfortunately, she often goes too far, further complicating the situation. She felt greater entitlement this time, and I found her more annoying.She is working in a fabulous penthouse apartment owned by a wealthy man. The home is immaculate, with little cleaning necessary, only cooking, laundry, and shopping for groceries. Her wages are generous. The man of the house has warned her never to enter his wife's room as she is ill. Of course, Millie's curiosity and contrary behaviour causes her to open that door. She encounters a badly beaten and injured wife, who she is anxious to help.The twists are surprising, and soon Millie will find herself in trouble with the police.

No suelo ser fan de las segundas partes y empecé este libro... con miedo. El primero me había sorprendido muchísimo y no sabía por dónde la autora sería capaz de innovar. Pero, a mi gusto, lo logró 100%.En esta segunda parte, Freida mantiene su estilo característico: capítulos cortos con finales enganchantes, narrativa fácil y una sensación de suspenso constante que te tiene con el alma colgando en un hilo... PERO a eso le sumó, mayor misterio (mucho más que en el primer libro), más terror (por suerte no leí las últimas 30 páginas en la noche) y le agrega más frialdad al personaje de Millie en una combinación que me pareció mega acertada (De verdad es un personaje al que ""amodio"" por sus rarezas/torpeza y su buen corazón).Probablemente, este no sea el thriller más complejo y completo que leerás en tu vida.

I clutch my daughter’s hand and smile back: but the second Mrs. Lowell sees my husband a strange expression crosses her face. In that moment I make a promise. We finally have a family home. My past is far, far behind us. And I’ll do anything to keep it that way…I used to clean other people’s houses—now, I can’t believe this home is actually mine. The charming kitchen, the quiet cul-de-sac, the huge yard where my kids can play. My husband and I saved for years to give our children the life they deserve.Even though I’m wary of our new neighbor Mrs. Lowell, when she invites us over for dinner it’s our chance to make friends. Her maid opens the door wearing a white apron, her hair in a tight bun. I know exactly what it’s like to be in her shoes.But her cold stare gives me chills…The Lowells’ maid isn’t the only strange thing on our street. I’m sure I see a shadowy figure watching us. My husband leaves the house late at night. And when I meet a woman who lives across the way, her words chill me to the bone: Be careful of your neighbors.Did I make a terrible mistake moving my family here?I thought I’d left my darkest secrets behind. But could this quiet suburban street be the most dangerous place of all?","[{'rating': 2, 'content': ""YASSSSSSS FREIDA give us absolutely….NOTHING!My blood pressure was indeed high after this debacle! 😟The Housemaid is Watching starts in true Millie fashion with her being somewhere where her ass shouldn’t be and now she’s all in the mix up looking down at a deceased individual bloodied up on the floor.Ok Millie lets gooooooooo!… unfortunately all the Twists and Thrills shops must’ve been closed because this book went NOWHERE! It gave juvenile family domestic! Which would have been ok, but can you at least make it fun please???I cant review this without giving spoilers, so don’t read ahead if you don’t want to be spoiled😏☆☆☆☆☆So the book starts and I already know Freida likes to introduce us to a bunch of characters giving us a bit of their backstory and setting up a scene. That’s all well and good but this dragged on for at least 60% of the book. Like nothing interesting was happening. All we knew was Millie and Enzo bought a property without blinds. They have two neighbours who have their irritating flaws, are nosy AF, and one of them wants to get down and dirty with Enzo.Their son Nico is acting up all of a sudden breaking glass and slapping up classmates for no apparent reason. Millie cant stop talking about how obsessed she is with her new house that has left them broke and she has high blood pressure, and then the biggest upset of all is I’m pretty sure the Enzo in this book was a fraudulent clone, because the Enzo I know would NEVER behave as diabolical and egregious as he did in this book.WILL THE REAL MILLIE AND ENZO PLEASE STAND UPIn the last two books I’ve already accepted that Millie is very naïve with a kind heart, but is a BAD B when business needs to be taken care of. Its been over 11 years and personally with everything she has gone through I would expect her to be just a bit more wiser. Evidently that was not the route Freida chose to take and she decided to also include Enzo's fine ass to the madness and make these two the most moronic fictional parents of all time.Which parent in their right mind would give their young child a pocket knife to fight off bad people?What kind of husband would not confide in his wife what’s going on with the maid? Enzo this isLITERALLYyour wife’s craft helping out abused women, but you want me to believe that her ‘high blood pressure’ had you keeping shtum and behaving like a shifty bellend!?GTFOH!Then Millie, I don’t even want to spend to long on you, but what a disappointment your character development really was. Your first thought being that your child could be a psychopath because they are acting out more than usually is BEWILDERING!FREIDA WHICH KIDS DO YOU KNOW THAT COMMUNICATE LIKE THESE 9 AND 11 YEAR OLDS?I know kids are growing up real fast in today’s world, but you can’t convince me they are speaking like Ada and Nico. Frankly both kids got on my last damn nerves, but I can’t blame them because they obviously have dimwits for parents. Oh and Freida you having an 11 year old tell another child that she will come into his room late at night and castrate him is REAL weird bro! What happened to kids reporting things that upset them to their teacher or parents?As for Suzette, Jonathan and Janice you lot can just go ahead andCHOKE!The reveal was underwhelming and unbelievable to say the least and having to trudge through how Millie was going to get Enzo out of prison was boring and predictable AF. Ada’s POV was eye-roll galore and did not a damn thing for me!The maid Martha can kiss my ass with that epilogue! Like was everyone just flipping mute and stupid in this book? You saw Millie who is someone you recognize, and you need her help, but instead of speaking out in the first chance you get alone time with her, You chose to behave like a creep staring her down like a loser, then start behaving mean and cold towards her when she rightly accuses you off being a thief!?THEN… Then you were comfortable to let Enzo take the fall for your crimes after everything he did to help you!??Jesus take the wheel!!!!!!!!!!!This book was aMESS!The only redeeming factors was seeing young Cecilia Winchester all grown up and being a boss babe! The chapters were short which was cool, but this book was longer than it needed to be. It could have definitely been 100 pages less, but Freida chose to spend the book giving us unnecessary fillers (Why do we care that Millie’s lipstick came off her lips but it made no difference because they were the same colour as her lips???? Why do we care that Enzo is setting up the plates and forks on the dinner table??? Why do we care about your thoughts about a praying mantis???) and telling us every damn little thing like we don’t have common sense.FREIDA please I am begging you, leave the housemaid franchise alone now okay hun?? I need you to put the paper and pen down and go on a long hiatus! I know you got to be tired babes with all these back to back books, because frankly its now showing!!I miss the old Freida and this book was a massive flop! It wasn’t exciting at all and you made all your once loveable characters be idiotic fools. Sigh 🙄“Were you completely shocked by who Martha really is, and by the Housemaids ultimate revenge? Did the twist and turns of Millie's and Enzo’s last adventure have you gripped?”FREIDA PISS OFFFFF! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣P.S.

Quick confession: I didn’t expect to love the third book so much, but it exceeded all my expectations! It\'s far better than the second book; I couldn’t put it down. I even canceled my appointment with my accountant, even though I have taxes to do. Who cares about taxes when there\'s such an amazing book to read? Okay, it\'s wrong to say something like that as a law-abiding, mature citizen, but come on, this book is incredibly good. I found myself wanting to stop time just to peacefully read my advance copy!What can I say to rest my case! The adventures of Millie the maid are the definition of addiction! I know I can find hundreds of people like me (maybe thousands) who, once they start one of her books, they cannot stop! It’s more addictive than Pringles! It’s riveting page-turners! It’s my favorite guilty pleasure!Her new adventure takes us 11 years later where we left things with Millie and Enzo. Now they’re older, married, having two kids; one A grader, sensitive, mature, smart daughter Ava, and a friendly, energetic, sporty 9-year-old Nico, named after Enzo’s family members. Their luck turned out, and their offer for the house has gotten approval which means they are about to be suburbanites, living in ( correction living ""ON"") Long Island.Millie is jumping in excitement to build a new life in a big house she still has questions about how they bought under its value even though they have to work harder to pay the mortgage. She is also excited to make new friends with her neighbors but unfortunately one of her neighbors cannot keep her hands off her husband, shamelessly flirting with him as the other woman who is health-obsessed and also a noisy busybody who likes to watch each step she takes from her house and make her uncomfortable. In addition to that, Enzo makes a jest to hire their neighbor’s maid Martha: the same woman she keeps giving her scrutinizing looks as if she knows her criminal dark past.Could Millie make the worst mistake by moving to this neighborhood where her neighbors act like she’s mud under their boot to scratch, her children keep acting like strangers and her husband might be too friendly with Suzette Lowell: their flirty neighbor next door? At the top of that somebody gets murdered as expected. Because where Millie goes, there should be murder, shouldn’t be? How will she save herself and her family without getting involved? What her family members keep hidden from her?Well: didn’t I say how much I loved this book that I should scream at the rooftops kind of! I\'m about to give this book ten stars which highly deserved!

I don't think he has changed much, he is still his mysterious self, protective, passionate and trust worthy. Millie is still her naive, off the track self. I liked Ada and Nico, would protect them with my life.GivenMillieis the main character, I didn't really see her as involved. She was just there observing things and that too in a completely wrong limelight. She wasn't good with the kids either.🚩Firstly, sending off Nico like that to Suzette's house? Am sorry, wrong!!!🚩Secondly, knows Ada is going through a tough time and does nothing.🚩The main issue was the way she continued to jump to conclusions regarding Enzo. So she only loves him when it's convenient for her and when she thinks he acts as per her. I did not appreciate the constant character assassination going on in Millie's head by the author.🚩Also, why was she turning into a little Nina?The overall crime was a bit predictable but the epilogue truly surprised me.Not sure how I feel about that. This could all have been avoided if Millie actually stopped being selfish and focused on her kids a bit?Although it's a binge worthy book, it doesn't make it a good story.Honestly, some authors need to realise when to put an end to a series.

And that's as far as I can say.Like all Freida McFaden books,quick and easy writing, very short chapters that make the book literally fly by, I finished it in just a few hours, I only stopped to sleep and have breakfast hahaha, but that doesn't mean the book is good.Would I recommend this book? No.I would recommend reading the first one and staying there.But I would recommend ANY book by the author in case of a slump or pallet cleanser, because the truth is that they fulfill the function that in my opinion they have, to entertain.ೃ⁀➷ 𝓹𝓻𝓮 𝓻𝓮𝓿𝓲𝓮𝔀:12/06:completely unnecessary, short review to come11/06:HAPPY RELEASE DAY!!

A THIRD BOOK???? Everything Freida writes I’m reading bitch.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'I was so excited for this one, but I was disappointed. To be honest, this didn’t even feel like a thriller for the first half of the book. There was very little suspense, part 1 was actually really boring. I felt like I was just reading about someone’s every day life.The rest of the book was a little better, murder mystery going on- who is the killer? But to be honest it never really pulled me in. There were no shocking twists, no extreme exciting parts. The one or two twists were somewhat obvious and they were not executed properly- very little suspense. It just felt like an unfinished first draft that should’ve been edited and made better.To be honest, if this wasn’t part of one of my favorite series I might have even DNF’d. The best part was seeing all my favorite characters again. Although Enzo was acting so badly the whole book that I started to like him less too.I think they set it up where there could be another book- I am not sure if one is needed now? This one didn’t even really feel like it belonged in the series. Was it the worst book ever? No, but when you are writing an addition to an amazing series, expectations will be high and this definitely did not meet them.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""4.35!I had managed my expectations for this one and it paid off so well. The writing was good and interesting and enough to keep you captivated and the way she thought of that plot twist 😭 like ik everyone including me predicted the main plot twist because it was expected but that epilogue?? 🤯 Had me screaming because I had no idea that it was going to happen.I had heard that Millie was going to be act like Nina and be annoying but tbh I get what she was going through and whatever she did or how she acted was 💯 valid. I also heard that Enzo's character was being 'butchered' I didn't feel that way either I think she had set up Enzo's character in such a way in the past two books that I knew even if he was the one there would be a valid reason and that he would never do anything to hurt Millie.Overall, I had sm fun with this book, it really took me out of the problems I was facing and I could just rely on it to take me away on a journey.___Praying that Millie isn't annoying or naive in this one (considering the time jump) I've also heard she reminded people of Nina.....which is not the best thing but lets go!🤞""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""To be really honest, I'm super hard on Freida's books. It's not that I necessarily dislike her books. I've actually read quite a few of them, and rated them fairly. I like that they're quick, fast paced and usually pretty entertaining.But I've been reading thrillers for a very long time and I just feel like her books barely tow the line for me.This book. Lol. Omg. I feel like, with what the population of New York is - I'm supposed to believe the twist at the end? Moreover, the other twist? Come on. What a let down and lack of imagination.The entirety of the first half of the book is like : boring, boring, boring, snooze, boring.The second half is like: Yeah, because I believe any of this shite? 🙄""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""I have so many thoughts about this book, but I'll keep it short and spoiler-free.Let's start with Millie—she's still the same after a couple of years, no big changes there. Enzo, on the other hand, felt a bit different this time. We all know he's super sensitive and practically worships the ground Millie walks on, but I only really felt that in the first few chapters. After that, he seemed a bit disconnected from his family.The kids? They were awesome! And that twist? Oh, the twist in the epilogue was classic Freida—totally unexpected and brilliant.Now, the first half of the book was a bit slow, setting up the plot and all, but it was still addictive and kept me turning the pages. Overall, I really liked this book. I wouldn't mind another installment in this series at all!""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""really this wasn't necessary-freida babe, 2 books were enoughwill still read it tho😭""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""3.5 stars“But it’s hard to ever get rid of somebody when they live right next door to you.”Was this book needed?Absolutely not.Did I devour this book in just two days?Yes!Honestly, I don't understand the need for this book. This was just an useless exention toHousemaidseries because there was just so much unnecessary drama and still I ate it up. But let's be honest this can never be as good as book 1 because that book made me a Freida McFadden fan for life. I wanted Millie and her vigilante shit but she acted so stupidly and naively in this book. She just kept on ignoring the signs that were right in front of her. Enzo was fine but he could've tried to avoid the misscommunication chains that only led to more unnecessary drama in this book.You must be wondering why I gave it 3.5 stars? Well, I needed something that could get me out of my slump and this book worked like magic. It kept annoying me with the misscommunications but it also kept me hooked with the plot. I kinda saw it coming but I was not expecting the last plot twist. It was well... something?This series is full of plot twists and mysteries and I loved first two books but nothing can beat book 1. I also liked seeing characters from previous books and I always wanted to know more about Nina and her daughter and how they were doing.Overall, this was an enjoyable and unputdownable mystery thriller by Freida McFadden.

The third in a series usually isn’t that great”Reading this sentence in the book made me laugh out loud cause it perfectly sums up this book in the housemaid series.Boring 😭😭😭 I wasn’t gagged at all. A couple throwbacks to the other books were cool and characters coming back into the story was a nice touch but not enough to make up for the absolutely boring storyline and eye-roll plot twists.I was sooooo excited for this but it fell so short of what I wanted. Maybe my expectations were too high but we definitely could have done without this addition. Sorry Freida. Love ya.Anyway, in true Freida style, everything happens in the last 100 pages, so the first 300 pages were a slog to get through. Literally NOTHING happens. I didn’t guess any of the plot twists because I went way more farfetched than they ended up being. So the actual plot twists were a bit of a let down. It was a pretty frustrating read to be honest.

Plus, there is the warning""Be careful of your neighbors"". Nothing feels more welcoming than being told to be on your guard!Fans of the series are going to love this book! I also highly recommend reading the first books in this series (The HousemaidandThe Housemaid\'s Secret. That way you have all the background on the characters. Having said that, I do feel that this book would work as a stand-alone but again, read the first two books. They are fantastic!Millie, Enzo, and their children Ava and Nico have moved into a home in a nice community. This isHUGEfor Millie as she used to clean people\'s homes for a living. Now she has her own home. With it comes neighbors. There is one odd one who watches all her neighbors from her living room. Then there is Suzette and Jonathan Lowell. They have a beautiful home and you guessed it, a maid who is giving Millie strange looks. Enzo is also getting some looks from Suzette who can\'t keep her eyes off her handsome and buff new neighbor. Millie is not very happy about the attention Suzette is giving Enzo, but Suzette promises to help Enzo get new customers.Oh boy! This book kept me on my toes and turning the pages. Just when I thought I had this book figured out, Freida McFadden threw in some twist and had me rethinking my theory. I had so much fun with this book. I was lucky enough to have both the book and audiobook versions of this book which made for an incredible reading experience. If you enjoyed audiobooks, the narrators of this book were fabulous.Freida McFadden is a brilliant author who has a knack of placing me right in the heart of the book. I felt as if I were a silent observer in all the scenes. The characters were fantastic. There were likeable ones, some questionable ones, and ones I loved to hate. This book was such a fun and dramatic read!A brilliant addition to the Housemaid series!4.5 StarsThank you to Bookouture/Sourcebooks UK, Bookouture Audio, and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

I was unsure of one of the decisions the author made at the end that didn\'t give reasoning, but she is so talented I decided I missed something.

I\'m already missing these characters so much.The following review will contain major spoilers fromHouse of Flame and Shadowso if you haven\'t finished reading I advise you not to read this review until then.Also, Sarah recently confirmed Crescent City book 4 is happening (probably in a few years). This one is a conclusion for Bryce\'s story.[MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW]...................................This book was one hell of an emotional ride and it might come as a surprise that I haven\'t rated it 5-star, but the more I thought about the book the more issues I found in it so I decided to deduct it from my 4-star rating to 3.5-star which is how I feel.I got some theories right which I\'m very excited about, I also got some theories wrong which was expected because I knew Sarah would throw a curveball at me in this book. It\'s fun to explore the possibilities as a reader but also I love it when the author surprises me and Sarah did, especially in part 1!!!Let\'s begin with the ACOTAR segment:Keep in mind that SJM changed the timeline gap she originally intended between ACOSF and HOFAS (which was around 6-9 months in her first draft)The gap between ACOSF\'s ending and HOFAS events isapproximately 3 months(Nesta said she killed Lanthys 7 months ago, which happened a month before Winter Solstice in ACOSF). So it\'s June/beginning of Summer in the ACOTAR world.The Middengard Worm making a cameo was not on my bingo card.- Nesta deserves a 5⭐️ for being the badass that she was in all the scenes. I loved seeing her in action and to see glimpses of the warm person behind an ice cold mask she mastered wearing. We see more of her sentimental side when Bryce plays music (in the bonus chapter) and when Nesta bids Ember and co. farewell. Nesta is set up to be an important player in ACOTAR5 now that she was left with Gwydion/Starsword and to find out why she got the eight-pointed star tattoo.- Azriel, my beloved, also deserves a 5⭐️. Seeing the spymaster and the Shadowsinger in action alongside Nesta was fun but also the crumbs SJM littered in the ACOTAR segment for him makes me even more thrilled for his arc in ACOTAR5, now that is a protagonist that is being well-prepped for his own book. We touch upon his mother and fondness of music in the bonus chapter, we still don\'t know how he got Truth-teller and the fact that his precious knife was originally owned by Enalius (the first of the Illyrians) and that is another tie to Illyria, we don\'t know how his shadows and magic work, he finds out through the Asteri under the Prison that the Illyrians were made by them, and honestly SJM gave more than what I expected when it comes to him. His personality is even more fleshed out and to my delight many of my friends and readers are warming up to him (he always had a personality you just needed to look closer).""[...] that wasn\'t there as Azriel landed fromabove them. His wings were spread so wide they nearly touched either side of the cavern.""Thank you Janet for confirming who has the largest wingspan yet again.- Now, Nesta and Azriel as a duo are incredible!!! I love their bond and friendship and seeing how much they look out and care about each other. They understand one another and that has been obvious to us since ACOSF, they both master putting on an icy mask to hide their emotions.Rhysand alongside Amren made a brief appearance at the beginning of the book and he seems apprehensive about the Asteri and the fact that anyone can walk into their world (I think we will see implications of that in ACOTAR5 being that Rhys saw two alien females fall into his world only months apart). He\'ll grapple with the question of who else can enter their world and how do they put a stop to it.I loved the ACOTAR segment so much because it was lore galore and I was craving all that info dump since ACOSF.The whole history of High King Fionn, Queen Theia, and Pelias was darker than I expected and I\'m glad Fionn did not turn out to be evil. I still feel enraged and devastated with what happened with Helena and Silene (Theia\'s daughters). It\'s almost impossible to excuse their actions but it is still sad that Theia damned her own family and people because she thirsty for more power.I can\'t wait to see what more will be revealed in ACOTAR5!The ACOTAR-related bonus chapters include: Walmart edition (Bryce, Nesta, Azriel) + BAM/Indigo (Ember and Randall).My current theory is some of the events in ACOTAR5 will happen in parallel with HOFAS (at least the first 30% of the book).To conclude this part, I\'m glad the crossover did not take over a big chunk of the book because it IS a Crescent City book.I wasn\'t rooting for a major crossover either with Throne of Glass (as much as it pains me to say it because I miss them), it would\'ve tangled up all 3 series and we would end up with a messy storyline. Major crossovers work for movies, not for books.The crossover was important for ACOTAR and CC because they are tied by history and we got answers that are important for both. We got resolution for it in this book, but not yet for ACOTAR. I didn\'t clarify earlier, we did get some TOG crumbs but it doesn\'t have the same level of implications as ACOTAR and it does leave the door open for a future crossover, but as of now we know most of TOG storylines had their resolution but Sarah did leave the door open for more stories.Now... moving on toCrescent CityI was rooting for Bryce but I did find her reckless and insufferable in many moments. It makes me miss HOEAB Bryce but in this book she\'s coming off too much self-absorbed.It\'s hard for me to buy the suprise schemes Bryce pre-planned, I mean it works for a character like Aelin but not Bryce. Certain scenes are convincing and some came out of the blue or were too convenient.Hunt is my darling and it was obvious throughout the book he is hesitant and triggered by his trauma since Shahar\'s rebellion so he will question every step they take, and Bryce seems pretty dismissive to him during those moments which... is not doing her any favors. She\'s not helping him through it and it makes my heart break even more for Hunt because he is so wary of upsetting her about it. Like, Bryce darling... he went through very gruesome torture sessions recently so cut him so slack.Don\'t get me wrong, I LOVE Quinlar and I\'m always rooting for them but... I hoped we would be past their trust issues and disagreements over minor things. I still want them to argue and fight, I don\'t want them to be a perfect couple but all this still rubbed me the wrong way.I also expected a soul-shattering, emotional reunion after the whole ""our love spans across time and universes"" quote but I felt underwhelmed with what I got given one of them was in another universe and the other was being tortured.Still, I got many other moments that I loved and cried and gushed over. Especially their bonus chapter!On the other hand, I devoured all of Ruhn and Lidia\'s chapters. Lidia\'s chapters especially are just *chef\'s kiss*.This book made me fall in love with them more and I was eating up all the angst, all the longing, and the intense sexual tension between them.I wish they got their own book though I need more of them.There were a few surprises about Lidia that I did not expect but I also love that for her and it helped to better understand her motivations.The chapters I struggled with the most are Ithan\'s and Tharion\'s. I\'m sorry but they were a snoozefest except for a few scenes.I\'m happy with what Ithan became and the resolution he got towards the end of the book, but the whole Fendyr/Reaper storyline wasn\'t all that interesting. At least I got more of Jesiba who also has her own very interesting backstory.Also, totally rooting for him and Perry.Tharion\'s chapters didn\'t get interesting to me until Sathia came into the picture. It\'s painful to see him make one miserable decision after another. It\'s like Sarah testing how much can one character fuck up.Sathia was a delightful surprise, I didn\'t expect Flynn\'s sister who made her seem to be nothing but trouble come off as a compelling character. I hope we get her POV in CC4. I want to explore a Fae female\'s POV who lived among the Fae and how their views and treatment of females turned her into who she is and how she can move on from it.I\'m a big fan of marriage of convenience trope so I\'ll consume all of it (if SJM manages to make Tharion more likable).Flynn (and his sprites), Declan, Baxian played important roles and I still adore them. I just can\'t help but think of how Baxian will live on without his mate Danika, it hurts.I was totally bamboozled by who Hunt\'s father is, let\'s just say he was conceived through team effort. He has three dads.Moving on to the villains:I\'ll start with the character that had the most satisfying death and it\'s Pollux. Lidia the female that you are. It was perfection.I didn\'t like how the Autumn King and King Morven of Avallen were off\'ed. It felt too convenient and I wanted a more satisfying resolution between Bryce/Ruhn and the Autumn King. He can get killed all over again for all I care, I just hoped it would be under a different scenario.Good riddance Sabine is dead.I expected something more in the final confrontation with the Asteri but it wasn\'t as epic as I expected it to be. I mean I\'m glad they\'re gone but I don\'t know... it was too easy. I don\'t think it even took 50 pages to off them.I felt like every villain was eliminated way too easily and way too conveniently. I think it would\'ve been better to spread out their deaths between HOSAB and HOFAS.I\'m glad that we saw Aidas, Apollion, and Thanatos but I was hoping for an epic battle between them and the Asteri. That one was too quick.There is one trope Sarah likes to pull in the climax but I\'m getting bored of it because she did it too many times to the point it no longer is impactful as it intends to be.Another thing that threw me off was shift between different character POVs mid chapter which felt like a whiplash and needed better formatting. To me I don\'t think Sarah is weak when it comes to writing multiple POVs (look at Throne of Glass), but for some reason it didn\'t have a smooth flow in this book.Overall, I did enjoy parts of book but Sarah took a big risk with the crossover.Though will say I\'m left with questions like:• What happened to the comms Crystal Ruhn gave Bryce before she escaped to Prythian?• What about all the Thurr connections and comparisons to Hunt?• What\'s the point of Ariadne and her dragon flame being able to burn even Princes of Hel?• Did we just forget about Viktoria?• Octartis (the Asteri) was a female in HOSAB, but in HOFAS it\'s a male?There are obvious continuity errors, typos and inconsistencies this book suffered from.Don\'t let my review impact your experience with this book or your rating, I love these characters and this world and I will miss them dearly but I always planned to keep my review transparent when it comes to this book. Sarah is one of my all-time favorite authors and half of her books are 5-stars to me so you\'ll know it will take a lot to sway me from that rating.I will definitely revisit these books in the future, I have attachment issues with Sarah\'s books.I will end this review with my favorite quote in HOFAS that made me sob even harder the moment I read it because of what it meant to these characters and to me.The friends they’d made were what mattered in the end. Not the enemies.Through love, all is possible.Thank you Sarah for another emotional journey I\'m forever grateful for the stories and the characters you always gift us ❤️'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3⭐️ Definitely had its moments but it wasn’t my favorite.***This review containsSPOILERSso if you have not read HOFAS or the previous books in the series, STOP SCROLLING ***PS: If you want to read the bonus chapters, I have them ALL on my story highlights on Instagram @thebiglittlelibrary 🫶 My favorites are Target\'s & BAM\'s!...Here\'s a fun, little summary of what happens:✨ ACOTAR crossover✨ Bryce eats a magic bean✨ Middengard Worm cameo✨ History lesson with a ghost✨ Nesta slayyyyyys✨ Tharion is an idiot✨ Baxian gets hungry in the dungeons✨ Ithan packs one hell of a punch✨ Lidia Cervos serves cunt✨ Boring Quinlar reunion✨ ""We All Live In A Yellow Submarine"" 🎶✨ Lidia\'s is legit Mother✨ Lots of sad boi energy✨ Hunt has a wardrobe malfunction 🍆✨ Asteri just being their usual asshole selves✨ Hypaxia is . . . there✨ “Don’t Fear The Reaper” 🎶✨ A random arranged marriage✨ Hel is DTF with an alliance✨ Hunt learns he was a test tube baby✨ Parricide 👏✨ Avallen gets a makeover✨ Bryce becomes death✨ Ithan nuts up✨ Hypaxia cures COVID✨ Epic final battle✨ Hel + sprites to the rescue✨AelinLidia serves even more cunt✨ Pollux gets fucked✨ ""Super Massive Black Hole"" 🎶✨ Bryce takes a trip to space✨ Hunt becomes Iron Man✨ Jesiba pulls a Ben Solo✨ Happily Ever After✨ My Little Pony reboot✨ House of Many Waters COMING SOON featuring Tharion (and Ithan)My Thoughts:Was it a bad story? No. But was it the best? No. There were things I liked and didn\'t like. I\'ll be going over all of it. So buckle the fuck up because this is going to be one hell of a review.First, I want to address the ACOTAR crossover.Honestly, I\'m indifferent about it all. I was surprised we mostly see Bryce interacting with just Nesta and Azriel, but I wasn\'t mad about it. I actually liked Bryce and Nesta\'s interactions and could DEFINITELY see them as friends under different circumstances. But honestly, Nesta was the best part of this entire crossover. Even after ACOSF I wasn’t a huge Nesta fan but after this, I really like her. I enjoyed seeing her from a total stranger\'s perspective!The entire point of the crossover was learning about Theia and her connection to the ACOTAR world - and it did its job there. HOWEVER, knowing that Hel knew the same history and could have easily shared this with Bryce is where my problem with the crossover comes in. If Hel had stepped in to give Bryce all the information (which Aidas says he didn\'t do because \'Bryce wasn\'t ready\'), there would be no need for a crossover. I mean, I guess at some point she’d have to visit the Fae world to absorb Silene’s Starborn power, but I believe it could have been done without even seeing any of the ACOTAR characters. Which pretty much makes me believe SJM did this as a fan service and/or as a way to get fans who haven\'t read CC, to read it. It was a genius marketing strategy, but I don\'t think it did much for the story. And unfortunately, I’m hearing from quite a few people that the crossover disappointed them. So, in the end, it may have backfired on SJM. But if you enjoyed the crossover, I\'d like to know and hear your thoughts on why. 😊What I liked:The overall plot.Listen, I gotta give it to SJM, she sure knows how to weave a story together. It\'s wild to me that even the smallest of details tend to have some significance later on in the story - things you may not have even realized are of any importance at all. I enjoyed the journey we\'ve been on since book one, and I thought how everything came together by the end was phenomenal.The insanity and possibilities of the Maasverse.I am still reeling from all the connections Midgard has to the worlds of ACOTAR and TOG. We mostly focus on the connections to the ACOTAR realm (the Fae home world) but we get some bits and pieces of the ties to the TOG realm thanks to the stories from Aidas and Jesiba. I am honestly in awe of how Sarah J. Maas is able to keep all this information straight and continue to build upon it. This is what I really admire and respect about the Crescent City series. From a fantasy standpoint, I think it was incredibly well done. This is a complex world with a complex history and magic system that can definitely be understood by a first time reader, but is probably appreciated more by those who\'ve read her other series. I\'m excited to see what Sarah does next in terms of connecting these worlds in the future.History lessons with Theia\'s daughter, Silene.This was so freaking cool. I absolutely LOVED learning more about our beloved ACOTAR world as well as the beginnings of Midgard and the role the Asteri played in all of it. It was a lot darker than I expected, which made it that much more interesting. The only thing I predicted beforehand was that the Prison was the Dusk Court, but besides that everything else was new information and super fun to learn about!Lidia mother-fucking Cervos.She is a baddie. Period. End of story. The things she\'s done. . . the things she\'s put herself through for years all for the sake of her sons. . . I\'m in awe. Lidia is the definition of strength. Her backstory was so heartbreaking. I legitimately cried. The way she sacrifices her entire being (mind, body, and soul) really reminded me of the way Rhys sacrificed himself while under the mountain. Both these characters put on a mask and became monsters in order to protect the ones they love. Even how they act after they are free and deal with the trauma is very similar. There\'s a lot of parallels between the two, which is why I probably love them both so much. Honestly, Lidia is my favorite character of the entire series and I wish we\'d gotten more time with her. Also, the fact she’s a descendent of King Brannon from the TOG world and therefore related to Aelin and Dorian in some way was not a surprise but super cool nevertheless.Lidia and Ruhn\'s romance.These two have my whole heart. 🫶 I absolutely ADORE them! They\'re probably my second favorite mated couple besides Feysand. They went through absolute hell in this book. Ruhn getting tortured and Lidia having to participate was so hard to stomach. Lidia saving Ruhn\'s life and nearly dying only for him to say“You’re dead to me,”made me want to scream. And finding out Lidia has children and her real motives for being the Hind absolutely broke my heart. 😭 They endure so much in such a short amount of time, and even though there was so much broken trust between them, they\'re able to accept the past and be there for one another. Lidia and Ruhn deserved their HEA. And if you haven\'t yet, RUN to the link in my bio at @thebiglittlelibrary and read their bonus chapter because it is so perfect!Ithan\'s character arc and story development.Did his rise to power feel a bit random and rushed? Yes. But I didn\'t expect it, so I liked that his story wasn\'t predictable - especially when he kills Sigrid by punching her through the throat. I GASPED so hard. lol Ithan was actually someone who really annoyed me in book two - he was immature and seemed lost - but his guilt for killing Sigrid takes him on a journey that ends with him coming into his own and finding his purpose as Prime. He grew up a lot and I honestly wouldn\'t be mad about seeing more of his story in future CC books. I\'m also excited by the fact he has the elemental power of snow! Just another connection to the TOG world.What I didn\'t like:The multiple, mid-chapter POV changes DROVE ME NUTS.This was probably my biggest issue. Most of the chapters had three different POVs. And at the beginning of the book, there were four main plots happening at the same time: Bryce in the Fae home world; Hunt, Ruhn, and Baxian being tortured, Tharion with the Viper Queen, and Ithan and the other random side characters trying to figure out wtf to do. So each chapter, we\'d follow one character and just as things were starting to ramp up, we\'d shift to another character in a completely different situation. Because of these constantly changing POV, the story didn\'t flow well and I wasn\'t able to truly immerse myself. I felt removed while reading. Maybe if each chapter had only focused on one, maybe two (max) POVs, the story might not have felt so disjointed.The predictable ending.While I enjoyed the Asteri plot, I thought the ending was predictable and incredibly low stakes (since you know no one important is going to actually die and stay dead). This could be because I\'ve read SJM\'s other series and have noticed some patterns and similarities to how she writes her endings. The allying with the \'dark\' forces of Hel, the sprites showing up last minute, the Lidia and Pollux confrontation, and Bryce dying and coming back to life, felt similar to the end of ACOWAR. And while the ending had a different plot, the familiarity of it all didn\'t allow for me to feel any surprise. It definitely wasn\'t a bad ending . . . I just didn\'t really pull me in.The story is plot heavy with not enough character / relationship growth.There was too much going on plot-wise with too many different storylines and too many POVs. While everything neatly came together in the end, the journey to get there was messy and overly complex. I think SJM could have found a way to simplify the plot and cut some POVs to make this easier to digest. But at the same time, because there was so much focus on the plot, a few of the characters and relationships didn\'t get the attention they deserved. Specifically, Hunt and Ruhn dealing with the trauma from their torture, Lidia dealing with her trauma, Ruhn and Lidia\'s relationship (see below), Ithan\'s and his character arc, and Tharion as a whole because what growth has he even gone through throughout this entire series?Not only did Ruhn and Lidia not get enough screen time to truly work through their trauma, trust issues, and anger, but THEY WERE ROBBED of a beautiful romance journey.(Sort of how we were robbed of more Elorcan in TOG.) I totally get the need for more plot in this book because it\'s the ending to the series and things need to wrap up. However, we barely scratched the surface of Ruhn and Lidia\'s romance in HOSAB. And then in this book, things are bad for a while before they come together without spending adequate time resolving any issues, healing from their traumas, and growing as a couple. I understand that it wasn\'t possible to do this in an already 838 page book, but I truly believe other things should have been cut to make their story more impactful. Or, I think they shouldn\'t have been a couple at the end so we\'d get a book that focuses on Ruhn and Lidia. Regardless, I think not diving deep into their story was a missed opportunity.Hunt and Bryce\'s \'reunion\'.This was one of the most anticlimactic scenes in the entire book. I was expecting Hunt and Bryce to immediately jump into each other\'s arms . . . to sob . . . to kiss . . . and say some incredibly romantic and sappy shit to one another. BUT NONE OF THAT HAPPENS. After everything they went through to find each other again, this was not the reunion I was hoping for.Hunt and Bryce as a coupleListen, I don\'t want to get into it but I don\'t think they have chemistry. Compared to SJM\'s other couples, they\'re definitely one of the weaker pairings. I get that in the story, they supposedly have this insane connection that spans across time and space, but I just never felt it. Side note: I LEGIT forgot they were married. 😂If you like Bryce and Hunt (and the rest of the Crescent City characters), I believe you\'ll really enjoy this story. But if you\'ve struggled to like or even connect with most of them, this story will probably disappoint you.Unfortunately, I fall in the latter group. As a whole, I think the CC characters are a bunch of immature idiots who act more like the stereotypical frat guys and sorority girls than people capable of saving the world. I mean, the majority of the characters are in their 20s but even the ones who are older still act childish at times.Bryce.I\'m sorry, but she\'s my least favorite SJM FMC. She\'s a selfish, immature, pick-me girl. If I had to read another sentence about how hot she was according to EVERY SINGLE GUY besides her brother, and listen to more of her shitty jokes (which EVERY SINGLE GUY thinks is so fucking funny), I was going to scream. And I get Bryce is a sarcastic bitch to everyone, but there\'s a time and a place for everything, and being obnoxious doesn\'t ever actually get anyone anywhere.Bryce also isn\'t a character that earned my respect as The Chosen One. Let\'s look at the origins of SJM\'s other main FMCs. Feyra was a hunter and Aelin was an assassin, while Bryce was . . . a party girl? The other FMCs proved themselves to be worthy of being the Chosen One but Bryce had zero skills to qualify her as a fighter or good leader yet somehow she was able to amass a group of people to follow her. Also, she never learned new skills. She solely relied on her inherited powers and the skills of others. Nepotism at its finest.Bryce was incredibly selfish when she unleashed an Asteri onto the Fae home world without a second thought for the millions of lives there . . . all because she wants answers, which she doesn’t really even get! Thank the Cauldron Nesta was there to save the day! And then, when Bryce tells Hunt, her supposed soulmate, to sack up and get over his trauma. Girl, WHAT?!Lastly, Bryce hating ALL fae because she’s had some bad experiences with a few seems incredibly close minded and just plain stupid. What about the fae in her life like Ruhn, Declan, Flynn and countless others who are kind and fight for what’s right? Apparently they don’t count. But how dumb is she to write off an entire race/species based on the actions of a few?Tharion.I didn\'t care for him in book one. I disliked him in book two. And I absolutely hate him in book three. I mean, does ANYONE like Tharion? Please, if you do, let me know in the comments and tell me why because I must be missing something. From what we\'ve seen, he is a selfish, immature, fuck boi that doesn\'t go through any character growth throughout this ENTIRE series. I was extremely annoyed that his POV took up a huge chunk of this book when it added little to this story. But it looks like SJM was mainly setting things up for him (and Ithan) to be the MCs in her next CC book. 🙄 I know I\'ll read it because it\'s SJM, but I won\'t be happy about it. He better undergo a serious transformation, like Nesta in ACOSF, or else that\'ll be the end of my CC journey.So many side characters that don\'t matter.Declan and Flynn.Okay, Declan\'s THE tech guy who only has use whenever SJM needed someone to hack something. How convenient. 🙄 But Flynn . . . I CANNOT for the life of me remember anything useful he did.Baxian.He\'s Danika\'s mate. Cool. And? I guess he\'s a hunk of meat that Bryce can call on during a fight. But as a character, he\'s not THAT special.Sigrid.She had so much potential but only propelled Ithan\'s character arc forward. Super pointless but probably setting up for the next book.Sathia.The most random of all characters. She pops up out of nowhere (I genuinely forgot Flynn had a sister) and married Tharion? This has to be a setup for the next book, but it just added another unnecessary piece to an already overly complicated story.Fury and Juniper.Bryce\'s ONLY female friends and I forgot about them lol. The fact Fury doesn\'t play an active role in this series is another missed opportunity. What\'s the point in Bryce having a badass friend if she doesn\'t even help??? I truly believe Sarah could and should have cut out a few of these people to simplify the story.Aidas\' reason for not just telling Bryce the entire truth about everything was flimsy.Apparently, it\'s because ""Bryce wasn\'t ready"". He couldn\'t risk her telling the wrong person and the Asteri finding out. So instead, he\'d rather have Bryce go on an insane goose chase and risk her life doing a bunch of other dangerous shit because he didn\'t think he could tell her the truth and convince her to keep her mouth shut. This entire situation just brought up my PTSD from when Danika withheld the truth from Bryce. Riddle me this, how is it that someone who no one seems to trust ends up with the most power and becomes the savior of Midgard??I also found it strange that Hel, a realm that has been trying to eradicate the Asteri for 15,000 years from Midgard and is currently helping other realms fight these beings, are fine sitting back, letting millions, if not, billions die throughout the years. From what I remember, after the initial rebellion with Theia, they tried helping once by creating the Thunderbirds. But that was eons ago and I don\'t believe they really tried since. It\'s like they were fine waiting till one of Theia\'s heirs was ready to take on the mantle and become the catalyst for a successful rebellion. But again, once they found Bryce, they didn\'t do shit to help her understand her powers or the history of Midgard and the Asteri. Ugh. Why??? There just isn\'t a good enough reason. So overall, I think Hel not stepping in more didn\'t make sense for a realm that is \'eager\' to help the universe, but also Aidas not revealing the whole truth earlier was such a cop-out and made Hel\'s entire involvement useless until it was convenient for the story.Overall, House of Flame and Shadow was an okay conclusion to the Crescent City series. I enjoyed how everything came full circle and how SJM scratches the surface of the multiverse. Sarah J. Maas is still one of my favorite authors, and even though this may not have been my favorite book, I respect the hell out of her and admire her. She\'s created some of the most magical worlds and stories that have changed a generation of readers, so she\'ll always hold a special place in my heart. I am excited for the next ACOTAR book, but I do hope she does what she does best and gives us a story with the perfect combination of a compelling plot, character growth, and romance. And for the love of god please don’t let it have more than 2 POVs.Favorite Quotes:“You’re as much of a monster as they are.”“Love will do that to you.”_______For Bryce, home was - and always would be - Hunt._______“You’re a prince, start acting like one.”_______“I don’t fucking care who you are, so long as you’re mine.

Because it\'s 1 AM and tomorrow 5 of my bookish friends are coming to spend the weekend at my place, I\'m going to post some of my raw notes because I don\'t want to leave you hanging. The plan is to come back on Monday and edit these into something easier to read lol. Don\'t expect these to be in an order that makes sense. There will be loads of spelling errors, ya just gotta deal until I can edit.With that said,SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT...FuryThe fact that all we “used” was her ability to pilot a helicopter is an embarrassment. Not to mention that this series was supposed to be about female friendships. We just, do away with fury and juniper altogether in this book. Stupid. Also, Fury literally makes a scoff about how all she’s doing is playing babysitter and I was like UH YEAH. THE FUCK?JesibaThere should have been breadcrumbs. We should have seen her interact with SOMEONE who knows Appolion *ahem, Aidas* and had her trash talk him. Then we’d be like what’s her beef?Book of breathings/library of parthosbig old plot hole. Disappointing.reunion between Bryce and Huntone of the things that made me SO ANGRYYYYYY like in the moment I was walking around saying “the fuck??? Wait WHAT???” I don’t see Pete for 24 hours and I will leap into that man’s arms. You’re telling me that *mates* who’ve been tortured and never knew if they’d find their way back to one another were going to like the fucking Ocean Queen stop them from falling into each other’s arms??? You cannot tell me they shouldn’t have been sobbing together. bullshit.Lack of character dev.I was surprised by this. I expected the book to at least take place over the course of a month, not like, a week. I get we don’t tend to change as humans thaaaaat much over a week but it\'s historically been something I appreciate that in her writing and we got none of it.Silene / Princes of Hel info dumpsI could go on and on here, but in essence, it’s bloody infuriating that there were people who knew everything all along and never guided or drop-fed that info to us over the three books. “You weren’t ready” I WANTED TO THROW MY PHONE what a cop-out. Secondly, by sharing all this info all at once, the reader doesn’t get to chew on any of it, the think about what it means. We’re just hanging on for dear life trying to take it all in. It’s like someone tossing us a ball… versus having a cannon full of tennis balls shot at you all at onceGeneral messiness/she bit off more than she could chewWhen I’m over here wishing that she’d kill some characters off, just so that we could have some emotional impact AND narrow the field, we’ve got a big problem. I think about Chekov’s Gun all the time when I’m reading… the rule in writing that if you include an element, you should use it by the book’s conclusion. And she just… doesn’t. I’ve never been more convinced than I am now after HoFaS that SJM doesn’t actually have some crisp master plan. She just leaves a fuck-tonne of Chekov’s Guns lying around, and picks them up willy nilly when it sort of works in a future book. That’s why it feels so messy, plot-hole-y, and just kind of ???the (anti)climaxthe whole final fight scene was anticlimactic, it never felt like anyone was actually in danger, and legit in all caps I was fuuuuuuming about the bringing her back to life. Nah. I’m fucking sick of it. Death is there for a reason. Get rid of it and you have NO stakes. Which makes all your hard work trying to get the reader to be worried about the character’s wellbeing null and voidOther things that made me real mad:•\u2060 \u2060what was the point in the viper queen getting a private fight between Sigrid and Ithan????•\u2060 \u2060\u2060SIGRID. are you fucking kidding me all of that round and round in circles and FOR WHAT.•\u2060 \u2060\u2060Ithan choosing to try to bring Sigrid back from the dead (reaper form) instead of focusing on what’s ACTUALLY important aka THE FIGHT OF THEIR LIFE WITH THE BIG BAD?????•\u2060 \u2060\u2060Bryce opening the coffin. why she acting like a dumb bitch? I literally wrote down: “????? Girl why so reckless”•\u2060 \u2060\u2060over promising and under-delivering: don’t make it seem like we’re going to get any face time with the acotar crew only to give us two of them•\u2060 \u2060\u2060The parasite is something they should have learned in the previous book.

They’re supposed to heal quickly, so which is it?? She’s spent over a decade in an abusive relationship with Pollux, so because he walked with her sons for a bit they’re just fine with it? Nahhhh fuck that. They shouldn’t have ended up back together by the end of this book and we should have gotten him making ALL the amends, her fighting with herself to learn how to trust him again, etc in the next book. THATS the character growth I want to see. ughhhhhh I’m still so mad lol.•\u2060 \u2060\u2060all that nonsense about to join or not join the blades… and she can simply summon the void herself???Lastly, and possibly most hilariouslysomething that didn’t really matter but spoke to how inconsistent SJM was with her own established rules: WHY DID IT TAKE RHYS 80 YEARS TO GET TO THE HOUSE OF WIND? TWIIIIIIIICE? He has literally winnowed just outside the wards and flown inside in a matter of seconds/like, a minute. He does it when Nesta is stuck in that nightmare in ACOSF. and TWICE we get oooooo he’s coming. look at that encroaching darkness. ooooo you better go. (proceeds to have a long, heartfelt goodbye with mom hugs) *closes portal before he ever arrives* bsffr.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""When you manage your expectations by being realistic and enjoy tf outta this masterpiece 😌🤭SPOILER FREE REVIEWI honestly feel so emotional finishing this book, saying goodbye to Bryce and Hunt's story. I was thoroughly entertained, invested and satisfied with the way this book was written. I would say that when you go into this book,please keep in mind you're reading Bryce's story, simply put you are going in for Captain Marvel and not Avengers Endgame 🤷\u200d♀️I also see people disappointed with the way Bryce was in this book.Even though she had few moments where I felt frustrated with her, I fully understood her. In a strange environment, she is not going to or supposed to act calm. She will be paranoid. Meeting new people whom SHE doesn't know and acting suspicious, trying to escape makes ABSOLUTE sense. Even in her irrational actions, there were rational intentions 👀Coming back to the book which is divided into Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3 like any other Crescent City book.Part 1explored more folklore, history, new places and people (for Bryce) and setting up a much more powerful world building. I found myself loving it, there were some big reveals and connections. I was also shocked to see one of the creatures back in the world and it brought intense memories. It also ends on a brutal note. Iykyk.Part 2was more hands on action, it built on to the reveals made in part 1 brilliantly. I see MANY people saying that this part bored them and dragged on. On the contrary, I found it to be much more intense and mind blowing. Lidia and Ruhn carried it beautifully. Part 2 ends on a very nerve wrecking note, and you'll immediately want to binge the rest of the book.Part 3was simply put- Binge worthy. Big reveals happen here, characters in this world get what they deserve and I ate it up. Ithan and Bryce were my favorite here, and surprisingly Jesiba too. It ends on a satisfying note and I just can't wait to see how it's going to add up to the future books.Onto the characters-❤️\u200d🔥Bryce-Although a bit erratic her actions are completely justified imo. She is the same Bryce we have grown to love- smartass, funny, badass, always standing up for the right and calculating. The sacrifices she's willing to make was emotional to see. But like any other, she does have flaws and is imperfect.⚡Hunt-My man. The way he cared for Bryce was everything. Even while getting tortured to the point where he is close to death, all he cared about was Bryce and his friends. He would do anything to protect them, even if it means he's gonna end up hurt. His big reveal was one that I was never expecting and I was shook. I loved seeing him unleash and put Celestina in her place.🔥Lidia-I LOVE her. She did so much for literally everyone good in this book, such huge sacrifices. She did not put herself first once and I loved her. I swear I just want to give her the biggest hug.🖤Ruhn-Loved seeing the way he felt for Lidia. Man's had me gasping, crying, emotional for more. His bond with Hunt and Baxian was intense and so loyal. The way he was protecting Bryce was everything. Tho that one scene made me dizzy (you know which one).🐺Ithan and 🧜\u200d♂️Tharion-Although different paths, I found them to be quite similar with the way they deal with their struggles. Before anyone gets frustrated with these two- Have you ever made a mistake and in order to correct it desperately, you make more bad decisions and more mistakes?? That sounds pretty relatable to me. Not all of us are perfect. Living in self loathing, guilt, and anxiety isn't easy. Tharion and Ithan thinking that they don't deserve anything good happening to them after making so many mistakes is real and it's amental health representation at its best.So many people acting like Tharion and Ithan were annoying breaks my heart cause I found them to be so endearing and loving, so loyal, so worthy despite what the two thought. I just wish to hold them and talk to them about it all.Baxian-All I'll say is he has strong teeth 😭Jesiba and Hypaxia-I appreciated so much what these two did, especially Jesiba. Without giving too much away, am sure you'll like them more.The romances-Bryce and Hunt-Honestly, after Feyre and Rhys these two are my favorite SJM couple and they are immensely underrated. Even in their arguments, they know when to support each other. They're the couple who will support each other in public even if they are wrong and correct the other in private.Ruhn and Lidia-So angsty. It's like they broke my heart multiple times and mended it to complete perfection. Literally everything about them is PERFECT. I loved how they communicated and bared themselves to each other.Also, did SJM throw in the marriage of convenience trope? 👀Y'all gotta find out for which couple, no spoilers here. 🤭🤭I believe people have forgotten that this is Bryce's story. In order to enjoy this book, you gotta keep that in mind. I can already see that SJM has foreshadowed a lot of multiversal possible scenarios. Hopefully she'll explore them on an Endgame level someday.But for now, am excited to see where the Crescent City series will go from here 😉 I highly recommend reading this series after ToG and ESPECIALLY ACOTAR.I did not want this to end, I could still read another 500 pages of this beautiful book and world. Already can't wait to reread 😭❤•~•~IT'S FINALLY HERE 😍😍 In all it's glory 🥹🥹~•~•~Am so ready for Jan 2024""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'The weakest conclusion to an SJM series by far. This book was one big deus ex machina clusterfuck. But I think most fans will overlook the huge issues in this book because we get to see some old favourite characters.Let\'s start off with the good parts:- Lidia Cervos 🧎🏻\u200d♀️🧎🏻\u200d♀️🧎🏻\u200d♀️Few characters had any agency in this book. Lidia was one of the few people who actually made a difference in this book. She really stole the show from Bryce and Hunt.- In the same vein as Lidia, Nesta lit up every scene she was in. Every scene she was in, I only noticed her. She really carried every part of the story she touched and she is so fun.- And obviously the entire Prythian part because those characters are elite. Loved the lore drop we got.- There was a particular scene with a few characters waving at each other that broke my heart.Now on to the bad:- Welcome to the Bryce Quinlan Show, where I spent 50% of the book asking myself ""Why are Tharion/Flynn/Declan/Sathia/Hunt/Ruhn even in this scene??"". So much of this book involved Bryce and Co. going somewhere to do something. But they all could have been Bryce\'s solo missions because it literally would not have made a difference if her companions weren\'t there. I think this was made particularly evident because there were 3 or 4 times where Bryce had to relay stuff she had done in the previous chapters to her group of friends. Because her friends weren\'t doing anything. The side characters felt soooo unnecessary in so many points in this book.- Another note on Bryce, she has some smart moments in the book but so much of her dominance is because she is The Chosen One. Everything she gains is because she is related to XYZ and has ABC in her blood. It makes it really hard to root for her because she didn\'t have to earn anything.- As I already mentioned in HOSAB, Bryce is only interesting in the context of Danika. By herself, she isn\'t that particularly interesting or someone I would root for. I think the strongest part about her was her friendship to Danika. This is particularly evident when anything happens between Hunt and Bryce. They just don\'t have that much chemistry tbh. I really wish this series had been about Bryce and Danika. Hunt really felt like a side piece. I really dgaf about this man.- I can\'t believe I had to read about Hunt going commando because his d**k is too big to fit into his underwear. I actually wanted to gouge my eyes out. 🤢😵\u200d💫😵 Also Hunt and Bryce getting handsy while their friends were fighting for their lives? Why were Ruhn and Lidia trying to get it on while their friends were literally right beside them in the cave? The most unnecessary scenes that were added just so this book can be spicy.- Ithan LOLOLOL. If you look up ""filler character"" he would be the #1 offender. He actually didn\'t do anything in this book for the first 70% and then he suddenly just have everything happen to him. His rise in power was the most eye-rolling experience because he doesn\'t deserve any of this.- Tharion sorry babes I wish I had skipped every scene you were in. I actually do not give a fck about this man. Suddenly Sathia appears. What did she even add to the story? Tharion and Ithan were the two most ridiculous characters in this book. I\'m actually so mad both of them got so much ""screen time"". But Tharion might get the ""Nesta"" treatment because it is clear his story isn\'t over.- In true SJM fashion, we get the ""We could have told you all of this in Book 1 but you weren\'t ready so we are just going to explain everything now"". I\'m so sick and tired of important information being gatekept for the sake of having a plot.- I want SO MUCH MORE grovelling between Ruhn and Lidia. I wanted the angst and yearning and the hurt x comfort. They are by far the best couple in this series.- LOOOL COOPER. Why did we focus so much on Sophie and Emilie in book 2 for them to basically not matter at all.- Sigrid and Ariadne felt like loose ends. Perhaps they will be important in future books but they took up too much time in this book for them to not matter much at the end.- OK, so book 1 had that big dramatic massacre, which really got my hopes up that SJM would actually commit to some gruesome ends for some of her main characters. SYKE! I\'m so tired of none of the characters actually being in danger.- Hypaxia exists to be a deus ex machina. Her and Jesiba\'s sole purpose in the series is to get people out of a pickle. They literally didn\'t serve any other purpose.- Also where were Juniper and Fury? They were completely neglected except for one scene.- While writing this, I just remembered I haven\'t even mentioned Baxian. That just shows how insignificant he was in every scene he was in. He just gets lumped in with Hunt and Co.- The Harpy comes back for her to get KO\'d in 0.2 seconds?- Hypaxia defeats a certain character very quickly. It felt so out of left field and rushed.Overall, this book felt sloppy.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'The harder you rise, the harder you fall. Sarah J Maas wrote her own kill switch to the “Maasverse” and activated it when this was published.Disappointed does not even sum up the entirety of how I’m feeling. For those people who are really enjoying and loving this, I am so happy for you, and I wish that was the case for me. But I am just glad to have finished it so I never have to think about it again. Long live the Crescent City duology. I am envious of the characters who got to die in HOSAB/HOEAB so they didn’t have to experience HOFAS and the defamation of character that touched every single character I had previously cared about and rendered them boring, two dimensional and soulless.For a book “millions of fans” have been waiting for for two years, Sarah did not deliver. She did not even purchase a postage label. The epic conclusion to the crescent city trilogy, which had so much potential, was reduced into a messy concubine of soap opera, unwanted comedy and minimal stakes. There was so much potential. So much potential and this is what we got. I am so angry.The writing in this book leads me to believe Sarah no longer cares about Lunathion, or her characters. This book is a testament to laziness, loss of passion and the arrogance of knowing no matter what she wrote, she would be making money.Through love all is possible… yet there was no love in this book. It was rendered impossibly cold and distant from anything else she could have possibly written. Through “convenient coincidences”, all is possible, should be her new slogan.I don’t even understand how in any stage of production, anyone at bloomsbury could confidently look at this and not question the drastic changes to characters, such as Bryce’s complete tyrannical selfishness, and Hunt’s stripped down personality and so on and so on. HOFAS was a failure and nothing more.Due to my disappointment at the entire picture, I could not even bring myself to be excited when certain plot points; which I would have screamed at, were unravelled, they felt anticlimactic and convenient at best. The the potential Sarah carefully constructed in not only the last two books, but the small sprinkles of lore throughout all her books, remains completely untapped and unused. Fans and theorists could have patched together a better ending to this series and (as someone who grew distasteful of theorists and did not look forward to a crossover) I’ve seen theorists who care more and know more and understand more of Sarah’s precious worlds than she seemingly did in this book.I am so so so angry. Sarah chose convenience, palatable and cheap shock factor over writing something meaningful. I can only guess this comes from the fact that “fame” has gotten to her head. Sarah has done a disservice to long standing fans in an attempt to suck in and appeal to celebrities and influencers, blending epic backstories and well planned out history into grey palatable mush that can be consumed by the masses, instead of the quality book it could have been to be consumed by the people that make this all possible for her.Even her regular fashion of fast paced, “epic” final 100 pages could not overcome first 700 pages of convenience, low stakes nonsense. There was no slice of life, no character development, just a long endless cave of info dumping and convenience.Sarah’s best writing is a footnote in the past. Bloomsbury I am so so disappointed in you for allowing this, marketing this, profiting off this. House of Flame and Shadow is a mockery of everything good in fantasy and did not deserve our excitement, our hope, or our joy.I normally restrain myself from negative reviews, because I do believe all art is subjective and everyone has a right to enjoy art as it comes. But this was objectively bad and there are no excuses. There is no explanation. Someone as revered as Sarah J Maas should be doing better as she rises, not worse. I hope HOFAS/Sarah and the rightful people at bloomsbury receive the criticism this book deserves so that they can ensure future books do not suffer the same fate.'}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""By now I’m sure we’ve all seen the news for special editions. Everyone is excited for the Adriel, Nesta and Bryce chapter so clearly Walmart is the move right? Everyone is happy. And excited. And that’s fine and dandy.But let me ask you this.WHERE IS CASSIAN???????WHERE’S MY MAN IN ALL THIS!He wasn’t included as one of the people in the bonus chapters and no one is concerned!!Did we forget that Elain saw a vision of Cassian dying??Why are Nesta and Azriel together while Cassian isn’t there????I’m scared guys. This book isn’t out and I’m already stressed.First of all, if Hunt, Bryce, and Ruhn don't live happily ever after in this. We riot.Second, if we don't get an Avengers level team up in this book I'm suing for getting my hopes up. That ending killed and then revived me and I don't know how I'm going to wait for this.Third, get ready for some crackpot theories cause my brain is spiraling!!! I don't know anyone in real life who has read this book, or who is just as excited about any of this as I am, so I have no one to scream these at. Instead, I'll scream them at you all!- Rhys' last name is Danaan?????- Either that or Ruhn isn't actually the son of Autumn King since he's clearly a descendant from the Night Court (Bryce literally thought Rhys was Ruhn so clearly there's a blood relation, But like the Autumn king is clearly from the Autumn court???? pls give me theories!)- Azriel has major ties to fey in Lunathion since he had Truth Teller and was the one that casually found Bryce. I no longer believe in coincidence. Everything is suspicious. If the whole ACOTAR gang can't cross to Bryce's world, I think only Az might. (The starborn sword and his knife have to fight together.- Fury and Amren are related or have similar powers or are of the same species (they basically act the same and no one knows what Fury can actually do). Are they one of the Asteri's creations??? Like how the Asteri made the angels and mentioned creating prototypes for the angels in the previous world which I assume is what the Illyrians are????? Where Amren and Fury creations of theirs in another world??-Hunt is part Thunderbird (We're told that he was literally bred for something and his father is a mystery) Like clearly one of the princes is his father, but like, the guy can literally absorb and use energy which is pretty thunderbird-ish.- Hunt is going to literally just suck the energy out of the Asteri and that's how he'll kill them. (I kept thinking that's what the thunderbird was going to do and then that went nowhere).-Cormac isn't dead. (I've decided that I like him and so he can't die.)- Cormac's side of the family might be related to Aelin and her world.- The shifters obviously come from Aelin's world and the wolves are lowkey related Fenrys????- I don't think Aelin will make much of an appearance. (the girl is tired, she went through too much let her rest!)- If Aelin does show up, it'll be brief. (As I said, she's tired, she's not here to fight) But if she does, I really just want her, Bryce and Cassian to interact because the chaos and badassery they would bring would be unmatched.- Ruhn and Lidia are obviously mates. Because duh. (Also, I totally called her being Agent Daybright. I knew right from chapter one that Lidia would be a good guy when she threw Sofie into the water.) But anyway, she might have some connection to Aelin???? I just get a vibe from her.Feel free to tell me I'm crazy. At this point, I'm grasping at straws and I know it.""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Erm, it’s no from me.I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again:Sarah J. Maasownsmy ass.I don’t feel this level of obsession for any other author.But this book? Was a shit show. I’m so glad it’s over. 😓I don’t even had it in me to be sad about this. I just wanna hate. Respectfully.✨Incoming rant review! ✨NO spoilers. Just a general overview.The first half had me captivated. I loved being back with these characters, discovering the world and the lore. Things were exciting!But, the second half lost me completely. The amount of running plot points we had started to read scattered instead of it coming together.Bryce, honey? You can suck my dick.🙂Her character arc was so messy, it made no damn sense! 😑The development was not there. Instead of growing into her power, her knowledge with wisdom, with the support of others that are much more skilled and smarter than she is, that understand the political nuance of the world better than she does, she chose to act like a spoiled, entitled brat, had the nerve to call herself a leader, yet was acting on her own accord all the time.She was running on arrogance and recklessness. She read stupid. She became the ‘alphahole’ she kept complaining about.I don’t understand why this was the direction her character went in. I don’t know what SJM or her editors were thinking. Or am I not understanding things correctly?No, I’m not the problem here.Bryce ruined it.She read like a bootleg version of Aelinand it was embarrassing to read. 🙄At some point, I had enough of the world-building too. A lot of information was being revealed and it was not smoothly laid out or explored. It just kept being piled on top of one another and I got bored. I don’t want to be reading pages of it.The crossover was another thing that was so poorly and boringly told. If you’re going to have a crossover, do it right. Incorporate the worlds together, because otherwise, why introduce it in the first place? The potential this aspect of the story had was squandered and fucked with. 😑Whilst I’m a fan of multiple POV’s, the constant switches here were making me dizzy. 🥴We had multiple perspectives within the SAME chapter. The paragraphs were too short. There was no time given to truly connect to their POV and immersive oneself in their struggles before we swiftly moved on to the next POV. I wish chapters were dedicated to them instead.This is by far my least favourite novel from SJM and now my least favourite series.This is not the SJM I’ve come to know and love. The one that creates found families like no other, romances like no other, mental health and trauma representation like no other with far tighter plots.I wasn’t expecting for my feelings to go in this direction. This was underwhelming and such a disappointment. I’m holding out hope that whenever the next book releases and I reread this*shudders*I’ll like it more? 😬I need ice cream.

I applaud her (yet again) for her ability to weave so many threads, characters and mythology into one insanely action packed tale.SPOILERS BELOW...I'm going to start with Bryce. I adore her. I feel like the theme of this book was ‘Level Up’, and she did this and then some. After all of the shit she went through in the previous books I loved see her step fully into her own.I’ve seen a few reviews criticising her character as being ‘insufferable’, which I find kind of interesting … mostly for the fact that when we judge something, it’s most often the thing that we don’t give ourselves permission to be or feel, or are judging within ourselves. As a collective, women have been taught to fear our own power, and here we’re presented with a fully fleshed, whole person that doesn’t feel the need to humble herself or shrink to make herself more relatable to others. Given the above, I get this can be polarising for some people who identify as female… but for me? I freaking LOVED this. The scene in particular between her and the two fae kings was so cathartic. SJM was really channelling some feminine rage and putting a metaphoric foot down against the patriarchy. Honestly, the amount of times I wish I’d been in a position to fight back like this… it was so wonderful to read.Bryce’s character arc across all three books felt right to me. The bit of tension between her and Hunt also felt valid - I could see things from both their sides and it felt true to their characters. Ultimately, Bryce was carrying the sole weight of being the key to destroying the Asteri, and her mental fortitude (while maybe it came across as being too headstrong at times) was needed in order for her to carry this out. Sorry not sorry.Onto Hunt - bless him, he really went through it in this book. I also thoroughly enjoyed his ‘Level Up’ towards the end. The romantic tension between he and Bryce was definitely higher in books 1 & 2 - here they were more in the ‘marriage phase’ of being a couple, which I guess is fine… although I wish we’d had a little bit more of a dramatic reunion / spice. Overall Hunt has always been a solid character in my mind.Lidia & Ruhn… I LOVE. They carried the romance in this book. Lidia was an incredible personality to work into the mix - she kind of reminds me a bit of Manon in that she’s not the FMC, but easily could be.Ithan - his scene with Connor had me sobbing. I had secretly hoped he’d end up as the Prime!Nesta - I’ve never been a massive fan of hers, but I was surprised by how much I enjoyed her in this book!. All of the snark and banter between her and Bryce was fantastic.Azriel - honestly, I’ve never gotten much from Az, and this book was no different. I think people project onto his personality (which is very quiet) and build stories about him in their own minds, because in reality we know very little about him, and he doesn't really speak that often. That being said, I loved the sweet moment between him and Nesta when he convinced her to take off the mask - it did mushy things to my heart.THE ENDINGI have no words except… what in the holy Interstellar!!? SJM can sure write a mind blowing action scene. So. Freaking. Amazing.THE ACOTAR CROSSOVERFor the most part, I was OK with how this panned out. There was always going to be a fine line between this remaining a Crescent City book vs turning into an ACOTAR take over.I think I would have liked just a **smidge** more from the interactions between Bryce and the gang - particularly with Rhys, Cassian and Feyre (who did not make an appearance at all.) It honestly felt like a Nesta x Crescent City crossover in the end, but I’m not mad about it. I am glad SJM stuck with the Crescent City POVs and that it stayed firmly a CC book.Furthermore, now that she has opened the connection between the two worlds, it leaves room for CC characters to cameo in future ACOTAR books which I wouldn’t object to in the slightest. And with the Starsword now back in Velaris… I’m sure it will come into play in future books.Side note: Randall & Ember’s bonus chapter - IDK why, but she continues to portray Rhys as an overbearing asshole? I just want the Rhys we know and love back.THE NEXT CRESCENT CITY BOOKI’d guess it will be a continuation of Tharion’s story. His journey in this book, was, essentially a retelling of The Little Mermaid - it would make sense for the next book given House of Many Waters is the remaining title. I think SJM put Tharion through the ringer in this book to lay the groundwork for a lot of character growth and redemption should his story continue. Maybe he and Ariadne are going to wind up together??Ithan's romance was also hinted at with Perry, but again there's a wide open space there so that's also another possibility.TO SUM UPI'm really sad this series is over, I've loved every second of it. <3""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Part One: The DropRuhn is pretty pissed at his girlfriend and our winged boys (feathers not leathers) aren’t doing great. Bryce is in a dungeon with a weirdly polite Rhys and friends but not the High Lady which seems not very “we are equals”-y. I had to Google Flynn because I could not remember who he was to save my life. Tharion is now a drug-addicted UFC fighter which I’ll call a step backwards. I have no idea where Syrinx is and this is very distressing. Nesta keeps being referred to as a warrior even though we all know that the biggest foe she’s ever faced is Cassian’s dick. Bryce’s Boob Star acts as MapQuest and Ithan accidentally kills someone he’s known for three days. Bryce finds out she hails from hella colonizers and then wakes up a haughty old bitch. Homeward bound! Azriel is apparently now the Nesta Whisperer?Part Two: The SearchBryce teleports into her dad’s office and he is a predictable dick about it. Ruhn, who asks to have his hand chewed off, is rescued alongside Hunt and Baxian and I cried. Lidia dies but this is a Sarah J. Maas book so she also un-dies. Ithan gets a job as an executive assistant in exchange for reanimating a corpse. Ruhn discovers that Lidia has little fawns and Hunt and Bryce reunite in a really unsatisfying way. You’ve heard of the Avatar, the master of all elements, now meet Hypaxia: The Fendyr-Bender. Bryce and the gang go treasure hunting on the island from MYST. There are many hieroglyphics and Hunt is a huge bitch while in Hel where he meets his dads. Ruhn kills their father (Vanserra boys take note), then Bryce sticks her sword in the floor of a cave and the land heals itself like the end of The Lion King.Part Three: The AscentSyrinx is with Bryce’s parents so everybody (me) can relax. The Asteri blew up a town square and killed a lot of people so Bryce decides to rip a hole in the space time continuum to get rid of them; perhaps they can be lured by a line of treats on the ground. Nesta just hands over her death Mask, which is totally like her and completely in-character. Bryce makes major decisions regarding other people without consulting them and isn’t sorry because deez nuts. Hunt decides he’s tired of his slave halo and just gets rid of it, I guess. Lidia is apparently Aelin’s granddaughter or something. Bryce sucks all the baddies into a void and then dies and comes back because SJM cannot stop writing anticlimactic endings. Nesta gets a nice hug. What happened to Tharion and his wife and the dragon and the dead alpha and the Viper Queen? What great questions that have no answers.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""1.)House of Earth and Blood★★★2.)House of Sky and Breath★★★♡ all 5 HOFAS bonus chapters:tumblr+redditthis was a reading experience, friends! after my content and trigger warnings, i will do a spoiler section of my thoughts because at this point in the sjm universe / maasverse, and this being the third book in the crescent city series, it is difficult to talk about anything without it being a potential spoiler!i had a good time reading this. I really loved lidia and ruhn’s storylines and they really made the entire book for me. I am also still so very in love with hypaxia, and the things i would do to get her pov. speaking of, I felt a little bored at some povs in hofas - mostly ithian and tharion (i am so sorry to these men, i love them and feel so much empathy for them, but it is true). and bryce’s pov made me feel a range of emotions, that’s for sure, but most of the time it wasn’t the best emotions. ultimately, i think there were too many povs in this book and sometimes the switching between them felt very jarring and unbalanced. i also feel like there was just so much going on, which valid, but instead of it being information that we started to learn in the first two books, it felt like sjm was kind of just throwing out every plot she could think up. and i think this all made the pacing of this book a bit weird feeling. but i did love that baldur’s gate unexpected cursed dot storyline a lot.like all sjm books, this could have been edited down a little bit (or a lot a bit). But i think what all sjm’s books do exceptionally well is discussion of trauma and grief and learning to live coinciding with those two very heavy things and also trying to heal from them, and how those healing paths can look very different for everyone. I feel like we can really see that in her crescent city series and it is always something that i will appreciate her putting out into the world.overall, i had a lot of fun reading this and making connections between all the things. if you follow my reviews, you will know how much i love theorycrafting and connecting different universes together, and this book truly took this experience to a different level. each easter egg truly felt like a long awaited gift i was finally able to open. and once i finished this last page, well… and all the bonus chapters, the anticipation i felt for whatever sjm does next was very surprising and a little unmatched. plus reading a new sjm book when it drops, with what feels like half of the online book community, feels special each and every new release.trigger + content warnings:death, grief, blood, captivity, slavery, extreme torture, a lot of violence, gun violence, maybe cannibalism / maybe just a lot of gore, battle, war, loss of a loved one in past (and a lot of talk about it), loss of sibling in past, defecation and urine mentions, self harm to get blood, sexual abuse, threat of rape, talk of forced breeding, talk of medical experimentation, talk of domestic abuse, talk of parental abuse, colonization, needles, bombings, a lot of talk and mentions of hurt children, vomit, a lot of talk of parasites, drugging / poisoning, self sacrifice / a lot of attempts at self sacrificingthis next section of this review will be filled with spoilers!please use caution!and please make sure you’ve read the entire throne of glass series and the entire a court of thorns and roses series!us finally getting the throne of glass crossover moment we have all been waiting for? I was truly screaming. lidia cervos, the woman you are. the stag throne, the hidden flame powers, the ruby ring, the blatant descendant name drop of whitethorn galathynius. i am still losing my mind while i type this. obviously bryce and ruhn being somehow related to rhysand is pretty cool. and i truly believe Ithan is a descendant of dorian because of the ice powers (and by the end of tog dorian was a shifter). but lidia being related to aelin? i am just speechless.lidia was the best character in this book for me, too. And she had the most heartfelt and empowering story going on throughout as well. and the naming of her one son brannon? truly, her and ruhn really were the stars of this third book and their povs were hands down my favorite. (that target bonus chapter? so good)okay more throne of glass crossover screaming - the under king! full credit toemmahalbrook on tiktok!but my jaw is still on the floor. i am just so excited to read reviews and find more crossovers that i missed, and to see all the crossover content that is still to come!my mind is still trying to process everything with theia and aidas (and helena and silene). i know rhysand is a descendant of theia and amren told him she was a prisoner of theia. But this book kind of makes it appear like amren was a captured “pet monster” of silene. i need to do more research but amren connecting all the gods and theia is really cool and something i think the fandom has been wanting more confirmation of for a really long time.okay back to crescent city, hypaxia was amazing, as always! i just love my sapphic necromancer queen. i know i made the baldur's gate joke above, but wizards of the coast are quaking at her finding the antidote to defeat the parasites and still finding ways to make it more easily accessible and forever lasting. she is actually the real mvp of this book.ruhn, hunt, and baxian going through some dark stuff and making jokes to keep light getting out of that dungeon. I actually really loved seeing their friendship in this book, even if… again, some dark stuff.i don’t want to talk about this, but ultimately i know i need to because i feel like this is the reason i am giving this book three stars, so let’s talk about it - bryce wasn’t my favorite in this book, sadly. her leaving cooper was just so cruel to me. i know many other reviewers are saying this, but bryce did so many things that made readers question that maybe she is turning into the villain (which might have been a little cool actually). but her leaving him behind was just wild to me. ember and randall showing they are upset because of this and voicing that bryce was wrong for leaving him still (or maybe even enhanced) made me so upset at her. But there were so many other instances too, like when she called lidia’s kids baggage? like when she told hunt to get over himself when the man was really going through it in those dungeons? what was all that? she felt so reckless and so careless and even heartless. ahhh i dont know, i just feel like bryce is easily my least favorite of sjm’s main characters, and i just liked her less and less each book, which feels so bad to say, but it really is how i feel.this is so random, but i also need to admit that i truly didn’t think cormac was dead dead, so i was so surprised when this book wrapped up and i guess that man really is! man oh man, i was truly waiting for that reveal and it just never came!okay, the ending! i loved seeing those three fire sprites truly saving the day. and them working at griffin antiquities at the end? oh, i really loved to see it. i shed many tears at jesiba actually saving the day, and i shed even more at bryce seeing danika and connor and everyone she loves waiting for her. and i did actually like the blackhole portal teleporting as well. the last 100 pages of this book were very strong and very heartfelt.and the very end? the way i truly wept at bryce's mom hugging and saying kind words to nesta. I actually felt insane with swollen eyes because of it. (the bam bonus chapter was probably my favorite of all the bonus chapters though. also, i just really want to live in the house of wind!) But yeah, i felt like this was a very strong ending to this book, and a very strong set up for whatever sjm does next! (probably with acotar now that nesta has the sword, dagger, mask, and a harp to potentially find bryce or whoever else whewwwww)lastly, because i cannot write a spoiler section review and not bring this up: when azriel said nyx is waiting too. oh, it got a tear from me. and bryce telling nesta and azriel how a phone works got a giggle from me. i truly cannot wait for whatever sjm gives us next.the acotar reread really came in clutch, especiallyacosf! But this whole reading experience just made me really want to reread tog asap! especially because (i can’t believe i am typing this) i think nesta is really making it hard for me to say that manon is my favorite sjm character!blog|instagram|youtube|kofi|spotify|amazon1.)Throne of Glass★★1.)A Court of Thorns and Roses★★★★2.)A Court of Mist and Fury★★★3.)A Court of Wings and Ruin★★★3.1)A Court of Frost and Starlight★★★4)A \u200bCourt of Silver Flames★★★★""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'SJM??????Byrce ruined this whole book for me..I feel like SJM just wanted to throw in everything in one book and hoped for the best.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""I FINISHED….IT’S DONE.I will never recover from this series. I will always be SO grateful to SJM for writing these books.I’ve been a certified #1 CC fan since the beginning. I adore these characters, world, lore, relationships - all of it, so much. Having said that, there were some things that did bother me in this book. Some parts were underwhelming, which really pains me to say.Overall though, CC will always hold such a special place in my heart.

I’m sure it is for some other prominent characters too.It will be a while, but there is a 4th CC book coming, SJM confirmed this. I honestly can’t wait to see who it’s about.

Despite my mixed feelings, I was completely engrossed the whole time and enjoyed it. It genuinely makes it hard to rate the book 🫠 I’m leaning towards 3.5 stars. It's not to say it was a bad book; it’s just not what I thought it’d be, and it gave acompletely differentvibe to CC1&2.Spoilers ahead!!-----The book is extremely plot driven, and I loved learning about the universe’s lore! I don’t think I’ll ever wrap my head around everything revealed. How Sarah can think up these ideas and craft such intricate worlds, I have no idea!🤯Part 1 was intense!The crossover was amazing. I appreciated how the book remained a Crescent City book and wasn’t wholly overpowered by the crossover. However, I didn’t like that too much was revealed all at once, too quickly, and mainly through direct dialogue. It would have been better if Bryce had discovered things on her own instead of being told straight up. It was almost a little too convenient. It set the tone for the rest of the discoveries as well. Nothing was played out entirely to its full potential.The lore was amazing, there’s no denying that, but the execution of it could have been better. It felt flat and almost like a tick box exercise, unlike Sarah’s usual style. With the number of things that were revealed, it might have been better to split this into two books as it sometimes felt rushed. I can’t get over the fact that this entire book's timeline wasONE WEEK!If it could have been spread further, it would have worked so much better, and that way, it would have addressed the lack of depth.My main dislike of the book was the completelack of emotional connection. All the characters lost the usual flair they had in CC1&2. It was as if they all lost their personalities. And maybe that’s with it being plot driven, but something just felt off with them all, and there was a sort of emptiness to them. It’s the complete opposite of CC1&2. Those books had me sobbing, but with this one, I didn’t find it anywhere near as emotional as I thought it would be or what it attempted to be. My issues with this started to present during part 2, with the reunion of all the characters.It was so underwhelming.We know Sarah likes her POV switch ups, and I usually don’t mind it in any of her books, but something was off here. The switches were abrupt and often within the same chapter, so any emotional development happening instantly fell short, and I struggled to immerse myself. Not to be picky, but there were many grammatical errors, too. I found many missing quotation marks, which just ended up disrupting the flow even further, as I was like'wait, when did the dialogue start?'On the other hand, I didn’t find myself getting bored in anyone’s storyline since it was extremely fast paced. It was hard to find a good point to put it down as the plot and the story just never stopped!Bryce frustrated me so much!She almost felt like a completely different character, and her character arc was extremely messy and frankly made no sense. She was acting as if she knew everything and was so unserious. Thankfully, part 3 is where she starts to return to her usual self, and by the end of the book, I was thinking'there’s the Bryce I know and love'. But the arc she went on to get to that point was bizarre.Bryce and Hunt’s relationship is part of what made me love CC so much, but their relationship in this book was flat. It lacked the chemistry, banter, and warmth they usually had. Sarah, why on earth did you have them arguing after their reunion!?!?!? Why were they constantly at odds with each other? I thought they had resolved their trust issues in CC2, so I did not like the angst between them at all. I get that they’re portrayed as a real couple, but I’m sad at how it played out 😭 They just needed to talk to each other and explain their feelings, but it was instantly shut down whenever they tried. That was primarily due to Bryce - I don’t understand why she acted as she did towards Hunt; she constantly dismissed his feelings. And again, the abrupt POV changes did not help. I’m glad they returned to normal in part 3, and I’m happy I got the bonus chapters between them to end it on a good note.Ruhn and Lidia were certainly a highlight!! There were loads of reveals about Lidia, which were completely unexpected. It made me love her even more. I must admit their relationship development felt awkwardly paced to me, though, which is such a shame because their romance journey could have been so much more beautiful 😭Surprisingly, I enjoyed Tharion’s and Ithan’s chapters. They added a nice reprieve from the intensity and added some value to the journey towards the end.Part 3 saved the book for meand was the only part where I felt somewhat emotional, even though the ending was pretty convenient. At no point did I even fear for any character, as it just didn’t feel high stakes enough. Shahar’s appearance was such a lovely surprise. I loved the reveal of Brann’s name. I didn’t connect the dots with that one, so I jumped out of my skin at that!! The sprites were some of my favourite side characters, and the mentions of Lele were a nice touch too 🥺 The Hel plot was handled well, and the reveal of Hunt’s father was a great twist.Overall,I’m feeling pretty bittersweet about it.Part 1 was good, I didn’t entirely like part 2, and part 3 saved it. It set up the next ACOTAR book well, and I can see how the next CC book will play out too.———————————————HAPPY HOFAS RELEASE DAY 🥳———————————————apparently the book has beenleakedand people are postingspoilersof the ending on twitter/tiktok etc😭 thankfully I haven’t seen anything but just had to give you guys a warning to be careful!!!———————————————OMG we have a cover!!!Jan 2024 can’t come quick enough 😫""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Super Magical Starborn waste of my goddamn time.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'oh wow no one died again.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Go girl, give us nothing!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '""The Hind knelt before her undying masters and contemplated how it would feel to tear out their throats.""❤️\u200d🔥-Line 1, Page 1.Spoiler Free Review.SJM has somehow managed to completely capture my heart and blow my mind once again!I want to start by saying that SJM never fails to completely capture my heart.

No murky or confusing plot points. No need to get out your legal pad to take notes. Lol. 😉The pacing was fast for a good amount of the time but slowed when necessary letting you breathe for a moment to take in all that is going on. The romance is absolutely chef\'s kiss 💋The magic is ohhh so magical.And that crossover - lawd. I need some of ya\'ll to get at me because...All in all SJM delivered, she put in the work on this one.I would say it\'s arguably her best book to date!Okay, maybe not that far.. but still one of the best.I\'m not going to post any quotes or passages at this time as the majority will be spoilers - will update this review at a later time for that. 💗'}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""if this doesn't have a scene where ruhn danaan declares his undying love for me i don't want it""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'i literally, don’t even want to talk about it.'}]"

Crown of Midnight (Throne of Glass, #2)
",Sarah J. Maas,4.35,1308896,318953,"Young Adult, Romance, Fiction, Magic, Fae, Young Adult Fantasy, High Fantasy",420,15-08-2013,"An alternative cover edition for this ISBN can be foundhere.""A line that should never be crossed is about to be breached.It puts this entire castle in jeopardy—and the life of your friend.""From the throne of glass rules a king with a fist of iron and a soul as black as pitch. Assassin Celaena Sardothien won a brutal contest to become his Champion. Yet Celaena is far from loyal to the crown. She hides her secret vigilantly; she knows that the man she serves is bent on evil.Keeping up the deadly charade becomes increasingly difficult when Celaena realizes she is not the only one seeking justice. As she tries to untangle the mysteries buried deep within the glass castle, her closest relationships suffer. It seems no one is above questioning her allegiances—not the Crown Prince Dorian; not Chaol, the Captain of the Guard; not even her best friend, Nehemia, a foreign princess with a rebel heart.Then one terrible night, the secrets they have all been keeping lead to an unspeakable tragedy. As Celaena's world shatters, she will be forced to give up the very thing most precious to her and decide once and for all where her true loyalties lie... and whom she is ultimately willing to fight for.","[{'rating': 5, 'content': ""Shit seriously just went down.Oh wow, where do I start with this sequel? I wasn't even sure I was going to read it when I recently finishedThrone of Glassand found it entertaining but a poor excuse for fantasy. You want to know whatCrown of Midnightfelt like? It was like the author listened to every piece of criticism I could have thrown at the first book, listened to everything I loved and everything that irritated me... and then wrote a perfect kind of book. The kind I wanted the first one to be; the kind I hadn't dared to hope she might produce in this sequel. There was more action, more nastiness, more character development, more surprises, more complications, more sexy, no love triangle - all of this and a well-placed, never-saw-it-coming twist. Ms Maas, consider me impressed.Crown of Midnighttakes a huge step away from the tame romantic/bitchy drama of its predecessor and opens up a story that is a bigger, bloodier and meaner than I think many readers will be expecting. Celaena gets to fully explore all aspects of what it means to be an assassin in this book; she is tested constantly and you can see her growing and changing and learning as the story progresses. And this story is one tumultuous journey of extremely high ups and unbelievably low downs with Celaena taking relationships to all new levels and watching others fall apart. Old enemies resurface and we start to get a glimpse of just how big the picture Maas is painting for us actually is.One of the strengths of this book is having no idea how it's going to end. You might think that's a given, butThrone of Glassintroduced us to a plot that was fairly easy to see mapped out. We are told of the challenges Celaena must compete in and win, we know that's what the book is moving towards, and it isn't too much of a leap to assume that (one way or another) Celaena is going to emerge victorious. Not in this book. This book starts with a blank slate, any mysteries or troubles that are to come are completely unknown to us - so every turn the plot takes is a surprise and every surprise is thrilling. I can't wrap my head around justhow much betterthis sequel is. Maas has already grown as a writer and storyteller, making me wonder what she can possibly have in store for us next.The characters are also so much better developed in this book. Maas is brave enough here to allow the main characters to make mistakes, do the wrong things and test our ability to like them. Well, I don't know about you, but the new dimensions to their personalities, their faults and weaknesses, only served to make me like them more. Dorian surprised me most of all. InThrone of Glass, Dorian feels like something of a plot tool, a pretty little obstacle to Celaena and Chaol's romance. The scenes with him felt like filler between the parts I was actually waiting for. But not inCrown of Midnight! In this, Dorian emerges as an interesting character with secrets of his own; he makes sacrifices for the people he loves and his importance to the bigger story starts to become apparent.In short?Throne of Glass...Romance, love triangle, pretty dresses, one-dimensional characters, little action...Crown of Midnight...Badassery, twists, nastiness, betrayal, more action, magic, secrets...If you were so-so about the first one and considering *maybe* reading this, you have my thumbs up.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5/5 ⭐Full review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolf🐺Chaol Westfall, a well-trained, muscular grown-ass man, Captain of the Royal Guard: *gets all soft and smooshy in this book*me: *needs to wrap him in a blanket, feed him some good hot Romanian rice pudding with lemon and sour cherry jam and protect him from the rest of the world because he is that precious*-\tActual plans that I really think about considering in a very serious wayAfter reading the first book of the series,Throne of Glass, I knew that I enjoyCrown of Midnight, but I’d never anticipated I’d enjoy itthat much.I\'ve decided to read this book in a teeny-tiny complicated period of my life: I\'ve been categorized by my ophthalmologist (cuz yeah, I wear glasses and not one buttwopairs, one of them being for reading, cuz yeah, my blind arse doesn\'t see well enough) as a ""are case"" and my eyes are „smashed"" because of too much reading and it\'s not normal. Sooo I\'ve been put through an ""a carrot a day"" cure and also ""only 30 minutes of reading"" cure. Because of that, I was not able to actually read as much as I wanted. But this book is giving to me a dependence that I am totally approving of, made me read so super-humanly fast that I\'ve managed to actually read enough in a day to accumulate the plot, the characters\' stories and the magic happening in general in Sarah J. Maas’ world.This book was better than the first book from the beginning. I think it is so much easier to get into the second book of the series because you have the advantage of the first one. In some series, the second, third, fourth etc. books are not as good as the first one. But in this series, you can actuallysensethem getting better and better (or maybe this is only my opinion). So second book of the Throne of Glass series > the first book (but don’t get me wrong, Ilovedthe first book too).It is useless to talk about the plot at this point already: it’s the second book, some covered plans are being made in order to wipe the fussy king from the surface of this world. Talks about rebel alliances and plans and talks about some long-lost heir of Terrasen’s throne, Aelin Ashryver Galathynius start pumping the air of the book. Some think they are just rumours; some believe in them because their lives depend on these rumours. But until the end of the book, everything becomes just a huge ball of energy that absorbs everything (including your soul) and in my opinion, this is so important.Sarah J. Maas is, in my opinion, a genius mind. She makes us fall in love, she makes us sigh, get angry, cry, wanna die and so on. All these elements are important spices in the whole dish of a book. I don’t know about other people, every single person has a personal taste, but I really think that this whole series is based on a brilliant idea, also very good narrated, even though I’ve read only two books.Now, talking about spice, even though I am actually kind of a bit (more) in love with Dorian, the Crown Prince of Adarlan, and I think he is the most charming and witty son of a wicked king I’ve encountered (since present moment) in any of my reads (remember that I am fairly new to YA Fantasy club) and I love his beautiful soul and the way he and Celaena work together, I cannot not be happy to see how the relationship between Celaena and Chaol Westfall, Captain on the Guard, grew. At least in this particular book, at this given moment. Even though some batshit happens and Celaena goes cuckoo bird.Going back, this book, the second book out of seven, blew my mind, made me laugh, made me sigh, made me cry, made me mad. And it was fantastic. Totally worth every single second I’ve spent reading it. I loved it.Also, Nehemia Ytger, thank you for existing, Queen!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Wow!

It was so good and I\'m just absolutely reeling from that ending. Because. Wow.Sarah J. Maas just delivered on this sequel.""Enough! We have enough enemies as it is! There are worse things out there to face!""Celaena slowly turned to him, her face splattered with blood and eyes blazing bright. ""No, there aren\'t,"" she said. ""Because I\'m here now.""Celaena Sardothien ex-prisoner of the salt mines has risen to the position ofRoyal Assassin.She must follow every whim of her king for four years. Only then, will shefinally be freed.It was a hard bargain but Celaenathought she could handle it.She\'s killed many, many before - so how could killing for the King be any different?The Mad (or merely cruel?) King sees spies and traitors everywhere. He frequently sends her out to murder innocents. To murder -not to assassinate- and that makes all the difference.Very quickly Celaena finds ways to smuggle out these would-be-victims, but with the ever-rising number of ""survivors"" (any one of them could blow her cover), the ever-increasing threat from home and the reappearance of an oldfriend-how could she even hope to protect those who matter to her most?I absolutely love how our main character isconfident, beautiful and completely in control- it\'s such a refreshing change from all the awkward, please-tell-me-I\'m-pretty and helpless heroines that populate many YA books.If they wanted Adarlan\'s Assassin, they\'d get her.And Wyrd help them when she arrived.The side-characters are so well-done. There\'s a bit of a love-triangle. Normally, I\'d run away screaming at the hint of a love triangle (I\'ve suffered through so many terrible ones) but Sarah J. Maas executed it perfectly. (Is there anything that the Maas-ter can\'t do?)Plus, that ending justsucked out my last breath.It was such a twist and it was so incredibly badass.

This is what I\'d like to call a gorgeous sequel. Dare I say it, it might even topThrone of Glass!Celaena Sardothien is doing her job as King\'s Champion, meaning she\'s killing people that stepped on the king\'s toes. And now she\'s got a new target: Archer Finn, former crush and friend from the time when she was within the Assassin’s Guild. Turns out, she\'s not killing her targets, but faking their deaths, so she\'s in a lot of danger if someone discovers her secret. The stakes are higher now that Archer is a well-known figure in Rifthold and that he might be involved in a rebel group. To make events even more complicated, the half-Fae and long-dead Queen, Elena, is asking Celaena to find the source behind the King\'s power.“Everything in this world is magic. Thank you ever so kindly for stating the obvious.”Celaena was a goddamn badass. I wouldn\'t mess with her in a thousand years. We finally see her wild and deadly side, the one that I\'ve grown accustomed to in the prequel e-novellas and that wasn\'t fully explored inThrone of Glass. Sure, she\'s still that sassy, arrogant and sarcastic girl, but above all, she\'s an assassin. A ruthless killer. And when the ones she loves are in danger or threatened, she\'s unforgiving. That part of her really gives you goosebumps. Oh, and let\'s not forget when she\'s in for revenge. One word: lethal.She was a whirlwind of steel and blood. As he watched her cut through the men like they were stalks of wheat in a field, he understood how she had gotten so close to touching Endovier’s wall that day. And at last—after all these months—he saw the lethal predator he’d expected to find in the mines. There was nothing human in her eyes, nothing remotely merciful. It froze his heart.Dorian Havilliard. Chaol Westfall. Dorian, Chaol, Chaol, Dorian. Chaol is the same sweet, loyal, funny, protective and fierce warrior. I loved his easy banter with Celaena and his alpha-male demeanor. Prince Dorian Havilliard is still the same passionate, kind, intelligent young man that is slowly transforming into a great ruler. And they’re best friends! How can I choose?!*crying*“I worry because I care. Gods help me, I know I shouldn\'t, but I do. So I will always tell you to be careful, because I will always care what happens.”InCrown of Midnight, Chaol and Celaena are getting close. Like really close. And because of that, both of their relationships with Dorian become more strained, awkward and tense. And that\'s kind of the single thing that bothered me at Celaena: inThrone of Glass, she was all over Dorian... and now? She doesn\'t care about his feelings when he clearly loves her. And that just got me going mad. I wanted to hug Dorian several times and give him cookies.Still, things evolve a little bit between them on a platonic level when a heartbreaking twist makes Celaena not trust Chaol anymore. And another unexpected twist involving Dorian makes things one hundred times more interesting.“When you do, I want you to remember that it wouldn’t have made any difference to me. It’s never made any difference to me when it came to you. I’d still pick you. I’ll always pick you.”I\'ve read some reviews that say that the love triangle\'s fate is sealed after the first quarter of the book. But now, after reading it, I\'m not so sure. Especially after that second half and killer ending. I love Chaol with all my heart, but I can\'t help but hope that Celaena will end up with Dorian. Now, now, don\'t throw stones at me! It’s still aCinderellainspired book! They\'re both swoony guys, but I\'ve always loved Dorian a bit more. Might be because of the dark-haired, blue-eyed appearance. And possibly the arrogance. And the bookish and funny personality. Perhaps even the fact that he\'s a freaking prince.*dreamy sigh*“If you are captured, if you are hurt, you are beyond our reach. You will be entirely on your own.”“I’ll be fine.”“But I won’t be. Every day that you’re there, I will wonder what has become of you. I won’t.... I won’t forget you. Not for one hour.”Nehemia was such a great support for Celaena, even if she had her own agenda. The princess is one of those selfless characters that would give everything up for the sake of her people. She\'s fair, ambitious and dedicated. And she\'s the key-player that sets things in motion in this sequel. But in a gut-wrenching method that will surely have you shedding a few tears.The villain we love to hate: the King of Adarlan, Dorian\'s father. His plans turn out to be down-right evil and unnatural. I loathe that guy because he\'s so willing to exploit everyone around him for his own sake. I want himD.E.A.D.*guilty smile*As it was to be expected, we meet new characters. My favorite was Mort. Why? First of all, he\'s an ancienttalkingdoor knocker. Second of all, he\'s hilarious!When they left, Nehemia spent a few minutes studying Mort— mostly asking him questions about his creation spell, which he claimed to have forgotten, then claimed was too private, then claimed she had no business hearing.Archer Finn was hard to read, but I never trusted him behind all those pretty smiles and coward-like behavior. Never trust a courtesan. Oh, and of course, there\'s Baba Yellowlegs. Even the name gives you creeps. She\'s an old, manipulative witch whose favorite meal is consisted of young girls. Told you: creepy.The character development is really spectacular. You can see how Celaena, Chaol and Dorian grow. By the end of the novel, our heroine is not running from her past anymore; the Captain of the Guard is ready to sacrifice himself and face his father; and the Crown Prince starts to stand up to the King no matter the consequences.“Thank you for all that you have done for me, Dorian. Thank you for being my friend. For not being like the others.”The pace was definitely action driven. I\'m not kidding when I\'m saying that sooo much happened and some many plots started to unfold between my eyes. Crown of Midnight was a page-turner through and through and there was never a dull moment.“How long will you keep her here?” Dorian said, looking down the stairs.She had attacked the Captain of the Guard in front of his men. Worse than attacked.“As long as it takes,” Chaol said quietly.""For what?”“For her to decide not to kill us all.”Another think that surprised me was the fact that Celaena is keeping so many secrets I can\'t even keep count. There were two revelations regarding her: I suspected the one revealed in the end, but the other one totally caught me unprepared. Both are jaw-dropping twists that will completely change the outcome of her adventures.“I’ll come back,” she said quietly. “I’ll come back for you.”The world-building was exquisite! We learn so much more about Erilea, Adarlan and the history of the country. We delve deeper into the Fae magic. It\'s a top-notch high fantasy world, coupled with a darker atmosphere, mistery, magic and amazing characters. The result is a certain recipe for epicness, one that Sarah J. Mass gorgeously created with her mad writing skills.If you haven\'t started this series, I\'m begging you -- pick it upASAP. It\'s complex, emotional and completely captivating. You\'ll laugh, you\'ll cry, you\'ll swoon, you\'ll gasp in shock and you\'ll fall in love with the story.Crown of Midnightwas an excellent follow-up that might not end in a claw-your-yes-out sort of cliffhanger, but it will make you crave the next installment like air. And man, what a ride that will be!*wink*ENJOY!<3You can also read this review here:http://raftul-cartilor-vampiresti.blo.............................................I NEED THIS BOOK!!!How can I wait another year?? It\'s killing me!!!!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'HOLY JESUS THIS WAS SO GOOD. I NEED THE NEXT ONE NOOOOOOW.Also, I appreciate the fact that this is not going to be a trilogy, we need more fantasy SERIES in the young adult genre.And Chaol <3'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '6th reread.Will I ever stop?That’s a no.————————————The ending. The ending. The ending. And the buildup to that ending? Absolute game-changer.My heart was beating! It brought me right back to the first time I read this series and felt my obsession with it and Sarah J Maas brewing! I latched on to it. And I have fallen in love alllll over again! 😍There’s so much that I justfelt!Celaena’s character development in this, to her finally beginning to accept and deal with her past, to stop trying to escape what it is she is meant to be, was incredible to read.And it hit me again how much she actually has suffered, from the time she was 8 till now. The people that she has lost, the sacrifices she has made to try and keep her soul intact and completely close herself off to the torture she experienced. It was so painful to read.I’m so not ready and ready for Heir of Fire. Pure pain and excruciating growth resides in that book.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'You can find the full review and more about this book on my blog!____________________________________________“But death was her curse and her gift, and death had been her good friend these long, long years.”____________________________________________5 BILLION STARSDon\'t get me started onthe cover,because you all know how much I appreciate these beauties.This series has everything on it\'s perfection,starting from the covers to the story and the characters,and everything.Simply perfection.____________________________________________“Who said anything about shame?"" She gestured down to her naked body, even though it was covered by the blanket. ""Honestly, I\'m surprised you\'re not strutting about, boasting to everyone. I certainly would be if I\'d tumbled me.""Does your love for yourself know no bounds?""""Absolutely none.”____________________________________________Throne of Glasswas a 5 star book for me,but comparing to this one,I don\'t know,this stands out in every single way.This is probably the best book I have read so far this year.I knew I will freaking love it from the first page.The story is more developed,the characters are too,and there\'s a moment where everything changes.That mind blowing moment that you should read to understand it,to live it.____________________________________________“What does that mean?"" he demanded.She smiled sadly. ""You\'ll figure it out. And when you do..."" She shook her head, knowing she shouldn\'t say it, but doing it anyway. ""When you do, I want you to remember that it wouldn\'t have made any difference to me. It\'s never made any difference to me when it came to you. I’d still pick you. I’ll always pick you.”____________________________________________The storyfollow Celaena,now officially the king\'s champion,doing his dirty work.The king sends her to kill people but she fakes every death.This trick becomes harder day by day,because she puts in risk the people she loves,her friends,her freedom and her being.She is torn between two protectors,Chaol and Dorian,who fight for her in different ways.But there comes a darker force,which Celaena has to fight,because it is her destiny,even if you wants or not.____________________________________________“Why are you crying?""""Because,"" she whispered, her voice shaking, ""you remind me of what the world ought to be. What the world can be.”____________________________________________If you remember my review of Throne of Glass,you would know that I did not loved Celaena,especially at the beginning,but gosh,she is now of my favorite characters I have ever read about.She is strong,and loyal and beautiful and has that weird sense of humor,that I truly dig,what can I say,I am in love:)____________________________________________“The rest of the world quieted into nothing. In that moment, after ten long years, Celaena looked at Chaol and realised she was home.”____________________________________________My favorite part was when Archer kidnapped Chaol and Celaena went to save him.That entry in the warehouse was phenomenal and so bad ass.Rest in peace Nehemia :(____________________________________________“I worry because I care. Gods help me, I know I shouldn\'t, but I do. So I will always tell you to be careful, because I will always care what happens.”____________________________________________Ihighlyrecommend this book if you have read Throne of Glass already.If you haven\'t then go check it out first and come to this one,because this book is perfection,like literally perfection.*Pictures from the review are not mine, I took them mostly from Google images or Tumblr*'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '“Some things you hear with your ears. Others, you hear with your heart.”To say Sarah J. Maas stepped up her game in the second book of her“Throne of Glass Series”most certainly would be the understatement of the century. No, scratch that, it actually doesn’t even get close to the truth. XDI swear in comparison to the first book this truly was an action packed and suspenseful read! =)Alone the many awesome fight scenes and the countless revelations throughout the entire book were already enough to cause my head to spin! Plus Celaena finally lives up to her reputation as Adarlan’s best assassin and actually kills people, which was amazing and involuntarily made me love this even more! *lol*Yes, Sarah can write and her action scenes always had me at the edge of my seat. Once or twice I might have even been close to falling off of my chair, but that’s another matter for another day! ;-PFor now all you have to know is that”Crown of Midnight”was an awesome read and that it was able to keep me on my toes and considering how many books I already read, this certainly should speak for itself. ;-)Since I don’t really feel like talking aboutthe plot(you’ll read plenty of it in my characters section aka The Spoilery Spoiler Section anyway) I’ll do something completely mean and will only give you a few words:Celaena, Chaol, Dorian, The King, Roland, Kaltain, Nehemia, Archer, missions, blood, death, creepy, magic, dungeons, books and let’s not forget about Fleetfoot!There you go! *lol* Haha! Oh Jeez that’s so vague you’ll hate me! XDWell, anyway! *smiles innocently*Let’s get to my favourite section!The characters:Do I still have to say it?! Yes? Okay! This is the aforementioned “Spoilery Spoiler Part” so if you don’t want to read quotes or spoilers or my crazy thoughts, you better stop now and never return. ;-P Don’t say I didn’t warn you!Celaena:”Some days, it feels like another person did those things. And most of those lives I’m glad I ended. No matter the cause, though, it – it still takes away a little piece of you each time. So I don’t think I’ll ever forget them.”Celaena is so kick-ass, I love her!!! We finally saw the relentless killer in her and I just couldn’t get enough of it! I thoroughly enjoyed all of the fighting scenes and the one with Baba Yellowlegs was definitely the best! XD I can’t wait to read more about those Ironteeth Witch Clans and I really hope they’ll be a part of the other books! Aside from the action I probably enjoyed Celaena’s character development the most. She’s no longer afraid to show her true self and she doesn’t only open up to Chaol but also to Dorian. I can’t say how much I loved all those new revelations about her and the fact that she’s fae took me entirely by surprise. I definitely didn’t expect that and I was like“WOAH WHAT?!!!”when I read it! I mean I always knew she had a secret and Sarah mentioned it often enough, I certainly didn’t expect it to be this kind of secret though!! *lol* I’m sure after the promise at Nehemia’s grave we can expect great things in the future and I’m so curious about Wendlyn; I immediately want to start with“Heir of Fire”.”I failed him,” she said. “In every way that counted, I failed him.”Another long silence, then a sigh. “Not in one way.” Chaol said. “I bet he would have wanted you to survive – to live. So you didn’t fail him, not in that regard.””I want you to know,” she whispered to the wind, to the earth, to the body far beneath her, “that you were right. You were right. I am a coward. And I have been running for so long that I’ve forgotten what it is to stand and fight.””The ship began moving. And Chaol – the man she hated and loved so much that she could hardly think around him – just stood there, watching her go.”Chaol:”She was a whirlwind of steel and blood. As he watched her cut through the men as though they were stalks of wheat in a field, he understood how she had gotten so close to touching Endovier’s wall that day. And at last – after all these months – he saw the lethal predator he’d expected to find in the mines. There was nothing human in her eyes, nothing remotely merciful. It froze his heart.”Ahh Chaol! My problem child! *sighs* I don’t hate him, actually I like him, butARGH!!!!He screwed up big time in this one and I just couldn’t believe what I read! I mean come on! You’re the Captain of the King’s Guard! You should be smarter than that!!! Seriously, in this book I really began to hate his loyalty to the king and it made me more than just angry that he never even thought about questioning the king’s orders! Chaol basically is the embodiment of the unthinking and unblinking soldier! Stupidly loyal to a fault!!! And that moment when he got kidnapped in his own domain?WHAT THE FREAKEDY FREAKING HELL?!Like: Are you kidding me!? I can’t help but wonder how he even became the Captain of the Guard. *lol* I’m so not impressed. Not at all! Plus he should have told Celaena about Nehemia, but he didn’t and that once again tells me that he still doesn’t trust her. At the end I felt kind of sad for him though. I mean he finally realised that he was blind and probably made the biggest mistake of his life. Unfortunately by then it was already too late to change anything about his misguided actions and he ended up suffering like crazy. Poor Chaol! =(”Once, Chaol might have argued. Once, he might have protested that his loyalty to the crown was his greatest asset. But that blind loyalty and obedience had started his descent.And it had destroyed everything.”But when Celaena walked out, leaving that damning will behind him, he didn’t even make it to his own room. He barely made it into an empty broom closet before the sobs hit.””But he could do this for her. Even if he never saw her again, even if she abandoned her duties as King’s Champion and stayed with the Fae in Wendlyn forever – as long as he knew that she was safe, that no one could hurt her … He’d sell his soul again and again for that.”Dorian:”You have power in you, Prince. More power than you realize.” She touched his chest, tracing a symbol there, too, and some of the court ladies gasped. But Nehemia’s eyes were locked on his. “It sleeps,” she whispered, tapping his heart. “In here. When the time comes, when it awakens, do not be afraid.” She removed her hand and gave him a sad smile. “When it is time, I will help you.”My charming and precious cutiepie!!!I love Dorian so damn much! He’s the best thing about the entire series and in“Crown of Midnight”he broke my heart. I suffered with him throughout the entire book and I really hate the idea that Sarah might make him a second Lucien. Neither of those two boys deserved what she put them through and I really hope she won’t continue to harm him in the next book. He’s just too pure for the world and he needs to be protected at all costs!!! Plus he’s amazing!!!I love the fact that he has raw magic in him and I see so much potential for the next few books! Still, his loneliness caused my heart to ache and I felt really sorry for him. He’s so alone and no one is there to help him, yet his first thought when he discovered that he had magic was that he needs to find out if his brother has it too. He wanted to protect Hollin and that’s so damn sweet! <33 Oh boy, how much I wanted to hug him when he frantically tried to hide his research in the library or when he was looking for Nehemia and waited in front of Celaena’s rooms. All this anger and despair - He doesn’t deserve it!!! Sarah, please have mercy on him!!!#TeamDorian forever and for always!!!!”How long have you been yearning for him? Was what he really wanted to ask. Damn him for caring. Damn him for every moment he’d spent with her.””How about you spend a year in Calaculla, and when you’re done, you two can sit here and tell me about your plans for expansion.””Something invisible slammed into the creature, sending it flying into the wall with a crunch. Gods. Dorian didn’t just have magic – he had raw magic. The rarest, and deadliest, kind. Sheer undiluted power, capable of being shaped into whatever form the wielder desired.”Nehemia:”I won’t deny that you have suffered, Elentiya, but there are thousands more who have also suffered – and suffered more. And they do not sell themselves to the king to get what they, too, deserve. With each person you kill, I am finding fever and fewer excuses for remaining your friend.”WHY SARAH!!!??Why did you have to kill Nehemia? She was such a lovely character and I didn’t expect her death! When Celaena found out about the King’s intentions I really thought that she’d be able to safe her or would at least come just in time to exchange some final words with her. But no! We found a dead Nehemia and Celaena never got a chance to fix things between them. T_T I hate it that they had an argument before she died and I really don’t like the way Nehemia had to die. I mean she didn’t even get a fighting scene. We’re presented with a fait accompli, which sucked! Well, at least in my opinion. So there’s that! Can’t say I feel sorry for Grave or Archer though. They had it coming and they should have known better than to mess with Celaena. *lol*”I have grown up knowing the weight of my crown. When the king invaded Eyllwe all those years ago, I knew that I would someday have to make choices that would haunt me.” She cupped her forehead in a palm. “I didn’t think it would be this hard. I cannot be in two places at once.””Nehemia was gone. That vibrant, fierce, loving soul; the princess who had been called the Light of Eyllwe; the woman who had been a beacon of hope – just like that, as if she were no more than a wisp of candlelight, she was gone.””But no matter what I did, Elentiya, I want you to know that in the darkness of the past ten years, you were one of the bright lights for me. Do not let that light go out.”Kaltain and Roland:”Sometimes,” Kaltain said softly, and Celaena paused. “Sometimes I think they brought me here. Not to marry Perrington, but for another purpose. They want to use me.”I still don’t know what the king plans with Kaltain and Roland but whatever it is, it can’t be good! That thing in the dungeons underneath the clock tower was so creepy and I really don’t even want to know what else is locked up there! *shudders* There’s no doubt the King of Adarlan is up to something and I’m kind of worried about Kaltain’s fate. I have no idea where and how Roland comes into play, but I get the slight feeling he’s allied with the king. I mean yeah he helped Dorian but maybe that was all show? Who knows? I’ll definitely watch those two closely from now on. ;-)""They encourage the crows to fly past here,"" Kaltain murmured, more to herself than to Celaena. ""And my headaches are worse every day. Worse and worse, and full of all those flapping wings.""The friendships & ships:Celaena & Dorian:”She deserved a loyal, brave knight who saw her for what she was and did not fear her. And he deserved someone who would look at him like that, even if the love wouldn’t be the same, even if the girl wouldn’t be her.So Dorian closed his eyes, and took another long breath. And when he opened his eyes, he let her go.”Those two!!!I know they had troubles at the beginning but the friendship that formed between them is so perfect!!! I’m so happy that they were able to settle their differences and I love Dorian for letting her go! This was such a powerful scene and I’m so glad they eventually managed to become friends again! I loved it when Dorian told Celaena that she will always have a place with him and that she could come to his dorms whenever she needed something.THATis friendship!!!THATis trust!!! Oh gosh, I really hope Sarah won’t crush this again! *lol*”Their eyes met and held. A line stretched taut between them – a moment of trust, and a promise of answers from both of them.””But looking at Dorian as he smiled at her, this prince who was smart and thoughtful and kind, who inspired good men like Chaol to serve him …Celaena wondered if Nehemia’s impossible, desperate dream of that court might yet come to pass.””Thank you for all that you have done for me, Dorian. Thank you for being my friend. For not being like the others.” He paused, turning to face her. She kept her chin high, but her eyes were gleaming.“I’ll come back,” she said quietly. “I’ll come back for you.”Dorian & Chaol:Dorian’s lips were pursed, his face stony as he quietly said, “I’ve been busy, too.” The Crown Prince turned his horse away, heading in another direction, but paused. “Chaol,” he said, looking over his shoulder. Dorian’s eyes were frozen, his jaw clenched. “Treat her well.”*sigh* Their friendship suffered so much in this book and I really wish this wouldn’t have happened. I loved that they were so close and could talk about everything, but I guess now that Celaena got into their way things between them might never be the same again. >_< It’s sad that Dorian can’t tell Chaol about his powers but I definitely understand why he’s so cautious. I mean Chaol was always so damn loyal to the king and that actually makes it more than just hard to trust him. If I’d be in Dorian’s situation, I wouldn’t tell him as well. =(”Dorian could have gleefully killed Chaol’s father for disowning him, refusing even to see Chaol when he brought his family to Rifthold for an important meeting with the king. Even though Chaol had never said it, Dorian knew the scars went deep.”Celaena & Chaol:”I know you can look after yourself. But I worry because I care. Gods help me, I know I shouldn’t, but I do. So I will always tell you to be careful, because I will always care what happens.”I can’t believe Sarah used 1 ½ books to build this relationship and then decided to thoroughly sink the ship! Oh wait! I actuallyCANbelieve it! *LOL* After reading ACOTAR nothing should surprise me anymore! Still, I mean I never was the biggest fan of this ship (everyone who read my review of ToG knows that) but I at least would have wanted them to be happy for a while. And the way it happened!!I can understand that Celaena was angry at Chaol but I really didn’t get why she acted the way she did. I mean at first she’s all in love with Chaol and jumps to his rescue because he’s been kidnapped and all she wants is to save him becauseshe loves him oh so muchand then in the next moment she’s at his throat and almost kills him! Hell! She didn’t even give him a chance to explain himself! Yes, I’m aware this would have changed nothing about Nehemia’s death, but I think if she would have let him talk, she’d have realised that he didn’t know about the king’s plans. She wronged poor Chaol so much and even though he made bad decisions I still feel sorry for him. Because let’s face it, he might have never trusted Celaena but he certainly loved her deeply. T_TWhat a shipwreck!!!RIP!”She knew his every move and he knew hers, as though they’d been dancing this waltz together all their lives. Faster, never faltering, never breaking her stare.The rest of the world quieted into nothing. In that moment, after ten long years, Celaena looked at Chaol and realized she was home.””It had snuck up on him, this pain and terror and rage at the thought of anyone else with her. Every look, every word from her … He didn’t even know when it had started.””But he didn’t know how to get her in line. He didn’t know how to fix what had been broken. Both inside her, and between them.”All told I really loved“Crown of Midnight”and I can’t wait to dive into“Heir of Fire.”Since this was another buddy read with myprecious GemI actually enjoyed the experience even more! XD I loved our discussions about the plot and characters and the fact Gem is such a hardcore Chaol fan only addedfire to the fuelto the fun. *lol*Let’s pick up book 3 soon!!! I promise I won’t talk bad about Chaol! Well, I’ll try not to! Scout’s honor! ;-P'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is how you write a fantasy novel. Great characters, development, evolution, and revelations. Magic used intelligently, and my personal favourite action. I could not put the book down. I like the way that they characters have their responsibilities and jobs, but that is not all that defines them. Celaena has no problem hacking up body parts, but she is still a girl who loves to shop. I think even though she is an assassin, she sees herself as more of an avenger. She will avenge her friends no matter the cost.The story Celaena Sardothien won the right to become the King\'s Champion (personal Assassin) since then, she has been charged with dispatching a number of his enemies. In many cases, she brings back trophies in the form of severed heads and family insignias (rings) still attached to the hands. However, having no love for the King she has been, she has been helping his enemies get away and fake their deaths. The problem is she is too good at it, and even her closest friends and biggest supporters believe she has completely turned over to the dark side. Then she is given a target who intersected with her former life in Assassins Keep (Archer), a courtesan (prostitute). This simple assignment sends a ripple effect affecting Celaena and everyone she cares about. They also fill in some history; there is a more detailed account of what Celaena did the day she ""snapped"" in Endovier. There are also hints that Celaena knows exactly who betrayed her. In the next book I am begging for a showdown with the King of Assassins, but so far Celaena has already made enough enemies to keep her busy for a good long time, which is great news for a long series. The only thing I did find annoying in this book is the right characters suddenly appearing exactly the right moment, but will all the fate and prophecies in the book, this could be easily explained.I am a fan of Sarah\'s writing style, having chapters of different lengths, and almost chunking the chapters so information is easy to take in and break up for me. This might be a fairy tale setting but that is where the similarities stop, this is more the grim story tales type of book, with grizzly deaths, torcher, and harsh language (even though the characters do not swear in print, they usually ""unleash a string of curse""). I love the Throne of Glass universe. There are references made to not only the first novel but the eBook prequels as well.This book is a lot more action packed to the first novel, there HUGE revelations about Celaena and Dorian, (who have a Luke and Leia type relationship), as well as the forces that are using them. It\'s a great book. Start it, and you will not be able to put it down. You do not need to have read the previous stories to enjoy this one, but they do help, and after reading this one, you will want to go back and read the others.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '2.5 starsAnswer me something. How can this—""She tipped her head back and gave the moon a wicked smile. She\'d been called Adarlan\'s assassin for a reason. Dramatic entrances were practically her art form.""—and this—""Curled on the couch beside Chaol, Calaena took a sip of her tea and frowned. ""Can\'t you hire a servant like Philippa, so we can have someone bring us treats?""—possibly be the same person?I teetered between liking and hating Calaena while reading. Mostly hating. I can handle the shoes and shopping because a girl has the right to look damn good while disemboweling enemies. (Fun fact: Calaena finally acts like a real assassin in this installment)But leaving her post todance?I\'m going to say it one more time to let it sink in. The world\'sgreatest assassinleft. Her. Fucking. Post. To. Dance.It\'s such a transparent attempt to squeeze in a moonlit waltz between Chaol and Calaena, I want to laugh.I\'m Team Dorian, by the way. Just putting that out there. Chaol is an overprotective fucknuckle who can suck it.Calaena still does stupid crap, like exploring without backup or sufficient research. Her obsession with chocolate cake is goddamn annoying. It\'s too cutesy and feels like Maas\'s trying too hard. Each time it came up, I felt like paraphrasing Amy fromGone Girl: No one fucking likes chocolate cake that much.Midway, as I was finally warming up to Calaena, she turns into an uber Mary Sue.She\'s part Fae, the lost queen of Terrasen, and has magical powers. For fuck\'s sake. Choose one, Maas. Don\'t be greedy.I originally warmed up to Calaena because of Maas\'s excellent portrayal of loss and depression. It\'s not resolved in a chapter or two; it\'s an underlining theme that affects the latter half of the book. I especially like thatCalaena doesn\'t forgive Chaol right away. Nehemia dying wasn\'t his fault, but her anger and distrust is justified.I also liked Dorian\'smagicsubplot. It\'s one of the few things in Crown of Midnight that made me sit up, and partially why I think he\'d be good with Calaena: ice and fire.He\'s a way better love interestandfriend. I don\'t care if it\'s planet-aligning true love, you don\'t sneak around with your best friend\'s ex-girlfriend. *cough*Chaol*cough* I especially like the part where Dorian sees them dancing and chooses to let her go. It was a sweet, poignant moment. And put me firmly on his side, even though I\'m destined to lose.Ah, well.A Court of Thorns and Rosesis amazing and I will definitely check out anything else Maas writes, but this series is a disappointing mess.My review of Throne of GlassMy review of Heir of FireMy review of Queen of Shadows'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""upon reread, ive decided to bump up my rating. knowing how the story plays out over the span of 7 books, its allowed me to view this with a different perspective. when i first read this, i didnt like how much page-time is focused on boring history, but now i can really appreciate all of the top-notch foreshadowing thats going on.everything else in my original review still applies.___________________________firstly, wow! i think this might be better than the first book! and i actually really liked'throne of glass,'so thats saying something!secondly, i saw a status update the other day where someone expressed their frustration with how women in novels, specifically YA, are too often portrayed as fierce and dangerous. while i agree that kindness and gentleness should also be represented, i have to say that ilivefor my ruthless and downright deadly ladies.for me, reading about celaena, about an assassin, is insight into a world i would never experience in a million years. i dont have a violent bone in my body. i actually think my body is programmed with a ‘flight and flight’ response. so i love being able to experience what its like for someone to have so much conviction that she would literally kill for what she believed in. that is the beauty of books, my friends.so give me a merciless assassin any day of the week. you go, girl! see ya in book #3!↠4.5 stars""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'SO GOOD.

The second installment doth not disappoint! Our heroine is back as the King\'s Champion so expect action galore. Hear ye, hear ye . . .Her lovely dresses and ornate clothes were gone, replaced with an unforgiving, close-cut black tunic and pants. Her hair pulled back in a long braid that fell into the folds of that dark cloak she was always wearing. She was a beautiful wrath …This book turned up in my room dressed in dark robes, whispered the first few sentences like a secret incantation and before I could utter\'By the Wyrd\'I was under its spell (not saying that this book has magical powers, but this book has magical powers . . . in fact I\'m pretty sure Sarah J.

The beautiful friendship between Celaena and him takes front stage in CoM. Sarah really takes the opportunity to flesh out their relationship in all it\'s banter-teasing-tension glory. There\'s talk of books(sigh)and late nights spent next to the fireplace.While Chaol\'s compassion and loyalty are beacons of light in the darkness of the Royal Court, the question is where exactly do his loyalties lie? With the Crown he has fought so hard to protect? Or with his friends who have made the glass castle a home for him?""Why are you crying?""""Because,"" she whispered, her voice shaking, ""you remind me of how the world ought to be.

Shocking isn\'t it that boys can experience the same emotions as female heroines(cough)?\xa0Sarah doesn\'t kick him to the curb either. Rather another layer of mystery is added when strange things start happening to him . . . things that put his life at risk.The most refreshing aspect of this trio\'s relationship is that Celaena is not turned into a Mary Sue mess in the face of these male ""interests."" Four for you Sarah J. Maas.I am not at all done with these characters and I\'m ready for their next adventure. CoM had it all:magic, adventure, epic fights, romance, mysteryandsecrets. . . so many dirty little secrets that aren\'t as neatly tucked into the nooks and crannies of the Royal Court as their owners would like to think. The ending left me as hungry for more as when I started.This series is going to go wondrous places in the next instalment and I can barely wait._____________________________PRE-REVIEW: 30/09/2012:2013?! No no no no no. Why are you so far away?!2013 is finally here!I just can\'t. Okay? I need me some more Dorian and Chaol. Pweeeeaaaaase?Be strong my shipper heart. Dear lord wilt thou not grant patience to my poor shipper heart?!TeamshirtlessChaol.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Esto es una maravilla.Hacía mucho tiempo que un libro no me ""llenaba"" de esta forma. El estilo de Sarah J Maas no es el más complejo del mundo, pero tampoco es una lectura sencilla y ligera. Sin embargo,consigue que me trague hasta el más mínimo punto para descubrir cada detalle(exceptuando cómo se viste Celaena, que me da un poco igual).La manera en la que Maas consigue sumergirte en la historia es espectacular, incluso con personajes que te puedan caer mal. Simplemente estás enganchado y quieres saber más y más.Vamos viendo en esta segunda parte de la serieTrono de Cristalcómorealmente hemos estado un poco engañadxs.A ver, yo sabía que había más... cosas, pero la forma en la que la historia va evolucionando está muy bien hecha. Sí, comenzamos con una esclava/asesina profesional y su propia venganza para el rey que acabó con la vida de tantos inocentes. Y sí, ella es despiadada y tiene un plan, y sabe sabotear al monarca.Pero tenemos siempre como ruido de fondo la magia, la extinción de esta, las Marcas de Wyrd, tierras lejanas que amenazan con rebelarse... Y ese ruido de fondo poco a poco va ganando fuerza.¿Esto es una historia sobre las clases sociales en un mundo de alta fantasía o... es otra cosa?EnCorona de medianocheveremos cómo las tornas cambian,y que el tema simplista de ser asesina se va entremezclando con otras cosas mucho más interesantes, profundas y mágicas. Es una muy buena transición, aunque sé que vendrán cosas más increíbles.Esta saga tiene algo que engancha mucho, y es que la protagonista nada entre dos aguas.A veces, no son tan claras, pero en otras ocasiones sí.Dorian. Chaol. Son dos caras de la misma moneda, ¿o no?Yo como lector no dejaba de preguntarme qué pasaba por sus cabezas, y aunque a veces tenemos una breve mirada hacia ellas, me siguen pareciendo enigmáticos y misteriosos. Y honestamente, es difícil decidirse.No me cae mal ninguno de ellos(incluso hablando de traiciones, como en este libro), porque siento que son personajes demasiado atados a sus actuales condiciones de vida, actuando lo mejor que pueden dentro de un marco opresivo que les ahoga. ¿Cuál es la decisión correcta en un mundo corrupto de por sí?Me gusta muchísimo cómo se plantean sus conflictos morales y personales para con Celaena o el reino de Adarlan.Como ya he comentado,el estilo de Sarah es cautivador. Engancha muchísimo, pese a no ser una lectura sencilla.Ni las palabras, ni la forma de narrar son algo propio de una novela pensada para ser adictiva y ya está. Tiene un componente muy literario, de profundidad, de lentitud, pero nunca deja de contar cosas. Todo lo que narra sirve para algo, incluso la mínima tontería que menciona de refilón.La forma en la que el misterio es planteado en torno a Elena, su Ojo y las Marcas de Wyrd me ha dejado con el culo torcido.Es un constante ""creo que va a ir por aquí"", pero termina yendo en la dirección opuesta, y luego te sorprende aún más, y sigues descubriendo más y más cosas que no te esperas. Honestamente, unas cartas muy bien jugadas.No entiendo, por cierto, el odio que algunas personas le tienen a Celaena Sardothien. ¡NO LO ENTIENDO!Me parece uno de los personajes más complejos de la literatura juvenil actual. Y es que no solo es compleja, sino bien construida, y además -que es lo más importante- no es buena. Tiene su parte mala, vengativa, llena de malicia. Que lo use para lo que tú consideres el bien o el mal es otra cosa, pero sus decisiones se basan en, sí, por qué no, momentos calientes o llenos de rabia. Y no hay nada malo en ello: es una maldita asesina.Me parece que tiene una personalidad clara y perfectamente dibujada. Es inteligente y llena de poder para engañar, que es un soplo de aire fresco entre tanto personaje heroico o \'bueno\'.Corona de medianochenos habla más y mejor de la historia de este universo. EnTrono de Cristalteníamos una buena introducción a ello, pero aquí, descubriendo más sobre el pasado y la magia que habitaba este continente, observamos que hay mucho más que contar y descubrir.Que si el Reino de las Brujas, el circo con Piernas Amarillas, los dioses antiguos, llaves mágicas... Es como que vamos viendo poco a poco un poquito más, y ese poquito expande muchísimo el universo planteado en el primer libro.Lo que más me fascina de todo, es que cuadra y encaja perfectamente con lo contado desde el primer momento. Todo tiene el más absoluto sentido, y se nota hacia dónde irá a parar la autora. No puedo estar más emocionado.Para mí ha sido una de las mejores lecturas del año,y aunque he tenido malos momentos con este libro (yeah,un paroncito lector o pasajes que me aburrían hasta comprender por qué eran necesarios), sin duda lo guardaré con muy buen recuerdo por haberme arrancado esa ilusión de mi yo lector de doce años con libros de fantasía.Necesito más, quiero más.Así que seguiré ya mismo conHeredera de fuegopara saciar mi sed.

I have to confess, even with the popular opinion being the series getting better with each book, I had my doubts. I couldn\'t imagine the author breaking away from her original portrayer of Celaena considerably. So, though she was more or less the same, it came as a pleasant surprise, to see she is now sharing the story with two other POVs. Though the Crown of Midnight was not a huge improvement, this is certainly a step in right direction.""Some of the things you hear with your ears. Others, you hear with your heart.""Aside from having multiple POVs, there isn\'t a whole lot different about this book: writing style, world building, characters, are nearly identical to the first, and moves along the same plot. And the first half did make me think this second book was not improved at all compared to the first. But then, right around the halfway point, an incident completely changed things, which led to a highly eventful, and entertaining second half. All the characters went through some dramatic changes after this point, and finally brought down some of Celaena\'s conflicting (and annoying) character traits. I also appreciate the use of multiple POVs. I know this would probably change in future, but in this second book, I think Dorian was my favorite character. But after how the author changes the characters\' actions spontaneously(like Chaol\'s), I wouldn\'t be surprised to see that change in future books.""You\'d be surprised how easily men see what they want to see.""The underlying plot of the story is still not clear, even by the end of this second book. But considering there are seven book in this series, I guess it would be this way, at least until the fourth or fifth book. Hopefully, the plotlines would be streamlined soon enough, so that the final books will not have a lot of loose ends. Overall, I liked the second book more than the first, and for me, it earned a complete star (from 2.5-stars to 3.5), and I\'m hoping to see the growth consistent.""You must learn to ask the right questions before you can receive right answers.""'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'sjm did Nehemia so dirty in this book'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'InfinityI love this series with all of my heart until the end of time stars!! ♾️⭐❝ The best lies were always mixed with truth. ❞❝ Sometimes you have to break before you can become something new . ❞❝ But death was her curse and her gift, and death had been her good friend these long, long years. ❞Well, to be honest... I don\'t even know what my deal was when I originally read this lol. I was probably ticked off with a few things that happened and knocked it down from a 5 star to a 4 star. And, to be fair, on one of my editions I have a 5 star rating and on another a 4 star rating- clearly I was really conflicted with this one when I read it the first time.Understandably so - because SO much happens in this book. There\'s amazing fight scenes, action sequences, the assassin starts assassin-ing and solidifies why she is such a bad ass. SJM can surely write the hell out of an action scene. I already knew what was going to happen this time so I wasn\'t on the edge of my seat this go round but I was most definitely tense.For me, Crown of Midnight is the crucial turning point in the series. This is where the original trio expands and allegiances shift as loyalties are tested. This is where we finally glimpse the bigger picture, the beginning of the end. Everything changes from here on out.The story expands to include new characters and new worlds as the true antagonist forces reveal themselves. What starts out as one woman’s fight to win her freedom from a tyrant king will become something so much more. I mean, who saw that plot twist coming? Definitely not me!Looking back after this re-read through, I’ve found so many clues and signs sewn into Crown of Midnight’s pages. It really was all here all along.

Except, now—for reasons they’re still not discussing—they don’t.They broke up six months ago. And still haven’t told their best friends.Which is how they find themselves sharing the largest bedroom at the Maine cottage that has been their friend group’s yearly getaway for the last decade. Their annual respite from the world, where for one vibrant, blue week they leave behind their daily lives; have copious amounts of cheese, wine, and seafood; and soak up the salty coastal air with the people who understand them most.Only this year, Harriet and Wyn are lying through their teeth while trying not to notice how desperately they still want each other. Because the cottage is for sale and this is the last week they’ll all have together in this place. They can’t stand to break their friends’ hearts, and so they’ll play their parts. Harriet will be the driven surgical resident who never starts a fight, and Wyn will be the laid-back charmer who never lets the cracks show. It’s a flawless plan (if you look at it from a great distance and through a pair of sunscreen-smeared sunglasses). After years of being in love, how hard can it be to fake it for one week… in front of those who know you best?A couple who broke up months ago make a pact to pretend to still be together for their annual weeklong vacation with their best friends in this glittering and wise new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Emily Henry.","[{'rating': 4, 'content': '➸4.25 stars”in every universe, it’s you for me.even if it’s not me for you.”— alexa, play maroon by taylor swift.can’t believe emily henry had the audacity to write a book about me!! ms emily reached inside my brain and took out parts of my life to write this book, it’s uncanny. i am constantly overwhelmed with how she can take the most deepest inner emotions of a person and articulate it in a way that is so relatable it makes the reader feel seen. i just love how she describes the complexity of adult life!did i finish this book or did this book finish me? even though this book is called“happy place”i’m just here to warn you that this book will not necessarily make youhappy.the audacity of EH to even call it that when this book fucking crushed me to pieces, ripped my heart out of chest, stomped on it 928482 times and then flung it into the ocean. this story explores heavy topics, it’s filled with love and loss, grief, hurt, trauma, change, happiness and unhappiness + friendships and family; this book was more melancholy, thoughtful and deep—this is ultimately why i loved it sm!— this story is narrated by harriet and it is alternated between apastandpresenttimeline, and explores how this tight-knit friend group met and harriet’s life since then. the parallels constantly left me in awe! we also become immersed in wyn and harriet’s past relationship and we are taken back to how they first met and fell in love.the past chapters are shown to be harriet’s “happy place” which is when her time is spent at a cottage in maine — an annual trip she takes with her boyfriend and best friends.”you are in all of my happiest places. you are where my mind goes when it needs to be soothed.”— second chance romance trope is honestly one of my favourite tropes, but only when it’s done well. i need to feel the connection between both characters, what made them fall apart and their journey finding their way back to each other, and i can say this book excelled at that. this book had me feeling all the feels. literally the PINING in this omg and the ANGSTTT and the pain, my poor lil heart couldn’t take it all. wyn and harriet were so torn up over each other, but they are so bad at communicating their vulnerability to one another. the chemistry between them is palpable despite the fact they’re not together anymore.PSA: this book relies heavily on past miscommunication/lack of communication so if you’re a miscommunication hater like me, be aware. these two are so broken and damaged, i couldn’t hate on it. harriet has a tendency to push everyone away, including wyn; and wyn has a tendency to worry and overthink things—which in time ended up clashing together but it was handled so immaculately, i found it bearable and i just wanted to see them both get their happy ending.➳harriet kilpatrick:harriet is me, i am her. she puts other peoples needs and feelings before her own to keep the peace. the way she has an inability to show others her emotions, especially during the break up bc she fears she will be a burden really hit close to home. her character was frustrating at times, but nonetheless she was so loveable and understandable bc her upbringing and family dynamic affected her as she grew up. she was never taught how to fight with the ones she loves and that took a toll on the way she communicates in relationships. but i just constantly wanted to grab her by the shoulders, shake her and scream “YOU ARE ENOUGH” i love her character sm, it was definitely bc i related to her in an unnerving way *cough*i also hate my job.her love for wyn was devastatingly beautiful, the way she loves and feels is so deep.➳wyn connor:wyn, wyn, wyn, oh how i love u. when his love language is physical touch 🤭 i died at that. my soul left my body and descended to heaven, not even joking- he’s my baby boy fr. we see his character as very self conscious and never believes in himself, we can see that he feels he is not enough for harriet and his self doubt instincts always take over but he loves HARD. on that topic; i didn’t understand how he can love so hard, but walk away so quickly without fighting for harriet, but it makes sense since they’re so bad at communicating 🥲— ms henry wrote another swoon-worthy character who is deeply flawed but loveable at the same time. i just love the way EH handles mental health topics and always manages to give so much emotional depth to her characters.꒰wyn and harriet:꒱i love both of their characters and i was rooting for them the entire book!! the witty banter and sarcasm between them had me giggling fr. you could feel the connection between them both, they are soulmates!! they both ache for each other and you can feel it all pour out of the pages. harriet and wyn are so different from each other—yet so similar, this is why they instantly connected with one another. i just love how EH made their conflict realistic and not forced and dragged out. we see them both focus on their self-growth and healing, but seeing harriet go through her self-discovery journey and then finding her way back to wyn has me in my feels rn, it just felt so real. 🥹“i thought i made you […] just by wishing.”➷ the friendships and connections in this book is so strong, but it also tackles how friendships can change over time as adult friendships can become so difficult to maintain as you age with everyone being in different stages in their life. i loved seeing this group navigate through it all, i crave a friendship like what they all have even though it’s dysfunctional and the conflict would be over lack of communication was juvenile but it made it feel so much more real. my main take from this was thatfriendships are love stories too. i just love platonic love!! also, the theme of found family runs so deep in this story, she executed it so perfectly >>>— overall, this book was phenomenal and i absolutely adored it, EH writing is just *chefs kiss* if you’re looking for a romance galore book i’m sorry to say this book isn’t for you, this book explores more about a friend group and their dynamics, growing up and letting go. i will keep saying, HER BOOKS ARE 100% MORE WOMEN’S FICTION, THE ROMANCE IS JUST A PLUS!!— but, i wasn’t a fan of the ending honestly.. it was really rushed and it didn’t fit harriet’s character; the decision she made fr left me shocked lmao. she threw all that away for a hobby, in this economy?? girl- 😳🧍🏻\u200d♀️──────────────────────────damn, she got me again!! no thoughts, just tears rn. EH, i will hunt you down for making me endure so much pain. rtc 😔❤️\u200d🩹──────────────────────────happyhappy placerelease day to my emily henry girlies!! this is a big day for us all. now bring me the angst, pain and tears.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Buckle up, bitches, because I have some things to say.P.S: if you liked this book, I\'m really really really happy for you. I wish that could be me! <3My review may contain some spoilers, you\'ve been warned.I decided to give Emily Henry another chance afterBeach Read,which I did not finish because it was bad in my opinion. So, I said ""Why not? Maybe this one turns out to be pretty good!"" and now that I finished it,I\'ve realized(after a long night of overthinking and self-loathing. Yeah, I know, it wasn\'t my best night, lol)that maybe romance as a main plot isn\'t my genre.First of all, I\'ve never ever been in love in my almost 25 years of miserable existence, nor someone has been in love with me, so I don\'t actually know how it really feels, (that\'s a deep and traumatic conversation for another day), but to me it\'s kind of unreal that people can last years and not get bored. Please, don\'t get me wrong, I\'m not saying it\'s not a real thing , but I can\'t even start to imagine someone loving me for so long without getting bored of me.(Plot twist: deep down, I\'m a hopeless romantic who yearns to love and be loved for a really long time and to be in a healthy relationship, but that\'s not gonna happen, so).Basically, Happy Place is about a second chance romance, between Harriet and Wyn (I swear I\'ve never heard the name Wyndham until the day I started this book), who broke up five months ago and reunite for a trip with their best friends. They have to act like they\'re still together and pretend happiness and such just to not causing chaos.The jump from past to present was not for me. While I enjoy those kind of flashbacks, things were ""interesting"" in the present than in the past.I felt like a fucking third wheel.Or perhaps like I was in the middle of a friend group which I wasn\'t part of and it made me feel uncomfortable, (I\'ve felt like that in the past, in many friend groups, and it feels awful) and if EH\'s point was to make me feel like I belonged with them, well, it didn\'t work out. They didn\'t even feel like best friends because there was a lot of tension and they were keeping secrets from each other (yes, I know this last thing happens a lot irl).The side characters had no personality whatsoever. They felt very flat and boring. Sabrina was controlling and kind of bitchy. Parth had zero personality. Cleo and Kimmy were okay, until I felt like they were not a lesbian couple, but a heterosexual couple where one of them is a guy with a girl\'s name. Don\'t come at me for this, I just felt it like that. Ididenjoy when Sabrina was called out. I get that they were in that trip mourning their youth and trying to have a good time, but goddamn it waspainful.I just could not stand them. Trust me, I\'m good at mourning my wasted and non existent youth, but this was pure hell.Wyn was flat and boring. Gods,he had no personalityand it was pretty clear.Even a shoe or a rock has more personality than Wyn Connor.What I hated the most is that basically Harriet was the one making the moves. Always. Man, if you really ""love her"" then go and fucking fight for her. MAKE SOME GODDAMN MOVES TO GET HER BACK AND LOVE HER PROPERLY.And Harriet, girly pop, please, have a little bit more of self-steem and respect for yourself. Stop being a people pleaser and try to save everyone. !I hate miscommunication.I believe it\'s one of the worst tropes ever and it\'s used throughout the book. Harriet complains and whines a lot, has a lot of inner monologuesbut she never says shit.Ma\'am, please don\'t expect that everyone knows what the hell do you want if you never say anything. I\'m not defending Wyn either, because he did the same thing. And they were constantly lying about how they were happy and okay. Both, Harriet and Wyn made a lot of assumptions instead of actually talk to each other, which could have spared us from a 400 pages book. Things could have solved up faster if they both had spoken first.Like, are you going to tell me that after a long-ass relationship of 8 YEARS, neither of you can communicate things?They could have broken up sooner if they just talked things through. It\'s like both communication and understanding were missing in the entire book. Also, breaking up with her over the phone? Are you fucking kidding me?This book could have been better if we had Wyn\'s POV. He obviously was struggling with depression, the loss of his father and his mother being diagnosed with Parkinson. We could have understood him more like this. But otherwise, he seemed indifferent about his relationship.My last straw was... Pottery? Really?Did you just throw so many years of med school, hard work and your residency for pottery? I don\'t know how things work for med school in the u.s, but, girly pop, I\'m pretty sure that isn\'t cheap, not even when you study in a good school. And holy shit, she’s a neurosurgery resident.(My dream was to become a neurosurgeon, so I was speechless and almost screaming like Regina George in Mean Girls). I\'m still speachless and amazed because how are you gonna pay your +$200,000 debts from pottery? Wyn must be a fucking billionare.I also felt nothing, nor empathy, sadness, pity or whatever towardsanyof these characters or their problems and relationships.The sex scene felt... Off. There was ""a lot"" of tension going on between Harriet and Wyn from the beginning, but when the sex scene finally came, it disappeared and felt dull.Anyways, not everything seems bad, lmao.I have this love/hate relationship with EH\'s writing style. For one side, there are some phrases where you can relate and say ""Same, sis, same."", but for the other side, Emily uses metaphors and stuff like that where is no needed.The only good thing, perhaps?I get the hype over Emily Henry\'s books, I swear I do, but they never captivate me or make me giggle, kick my feet in the air or feel happy. Maybe there\'s something wrong with me. Maybe, like I said at the beginning of this review, maybe romance as a main is not for me.I\'m not going to include this book in my big hype big lie shelfyetbecause I honestly didn\'t have many expectations for Happy Place.Nevermind, I just added to my big hipe, big lie shelf, lmao.This is where Emily Henry and I part ways.I guess I have more things to say, but I\'ll add them when I remember, lmao.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'I mean... if we are all going to read it....3.5 StarsI know, I know, but before you all come for my head, hear me out.I have never been so conflicted by a book before. I simultaneously really loved and kind of hated this book. Let me start out by saying I think Emily Henry is an absolute poet, she is nothing short of a master at her craft and this book is probably some of her best writing so far. The pacing of this book, the alternating timelines, the character development, the relationships were all beautifully and expertly written. So, you are probably scratching your head thinking, ""Beck, so what was the problem?"" Well........ I just could never buy in to what this whole book is about in the first place, the break-up, let\'s just call it what it is, this is the miscommunication trope on STEROIDS, ""Oh but it was more complicated than that"" WAS IT THOUGH? And if I am being totally honest, I felt like the ending was not enough payoff for the all the emotional trauma we were all put through.Let me start with the things I loved-The writing- Nobody does it like EH. She is an absolute artist with her words, the way she can summon the perfect measure of every emotion into every page is stunning and so rare. I can\'t ignore or deny the absolute magic that this author weaves into every page.""It feels like a moment before a car accident, when the tires have started to hydroplane and you know something terrible is likely coming, but there\'s still a chance the tread will find purchase and you\'ll never know what agony you narrowly avoided.""The chemistry- The chemistry between all her characters is so balanced and always feels authentic. The way her found family move around each other and interact with each other is so natural and genuine. And the chemistry between Wynn and Harriett was off the charts white hot! You could feel the sparks between them jumping off the page, it was palpable.""Maybe I need to know that he remembers that he hasn\'t totally forgotten what it feels like to love me, while I\'m trapped with him buried onto my heart, my, brain, my lungs, my skin.""Harriet- I really loved Harriet. She is entirely relatable; she is riddled with self-doubt and I appreciated her struggle to please those around her and form herself into what she thought the people she loved needed her to be while sacrificing her own wants and desires. I was thrilled for her when she finally started asserting herself and choosing her own path.""I\'m not the brilliant doctor my parents wanted me to be, and I\'m not the person who could give Wyn the happiness he deserves, and I\'m not the friend Sabrina and Cleo needed.""😭Ok, what didn\'t work for me:WYNN- Uh oh!! Are you all screaming at me yet? It\'s not what you think, I DO love Wyn, I think he is sweet and charming and vulnerable, and he absolutely loves Harriett, but the man could not muster up the strength to fight for her even ONCE this entire book!! I kept waiting for him to finally grow and fight for Harriet and it just never happens, even at the end it is HARRIET that moves first, it\'s always Harriett. I understand when he was struggling before but by the end he is supposed to be in a better place and it\'s still the same with him. How are we supposed to believe that this relationship will ever last long term, bc things will inevitably get rocky again as do all long-term relationships, but I can\'t believe that he will ever step up, if Harriet doesn\'t hold them together it will fail again. Exibit A down below!!!""You can\'t follow me like I followed you. I won\'t be enough.""""It\'ll get easier, he promises hoarsely, his hand brushing my hair behind my ear. ""Someday you\'ll hardly remember this""See!!! He is literally drowning, and he refuses to kick!!!The Break-Up- More than half of this book is putting us all through this absolute all-consuming agony and heartache for these two people who so obviously deeply love each other and are both completely shattered and heartbroken. The back and forth between the timelines serves to build on this epic love that spans nine years! And the whole time you are thinking, ""What could have possibly happened to tear these two apart?"" And then we finally get there.... and it just didn\'t math for me. Misunderstandings and miscommunication? A four-minute phone call? REALLY? And then just total and complete acceptance? Naaahhhh. I don\'t buy it. Sorry not sorry, it\'s just not believable for me. So, if Sabrina never orchestrated that whole wkend? Then what? They would have just been resigned? It just makes all those beautiful promises that Wyn said to her feel so empty and I think he meant them. Why didn\'t he come find her when he was feeling better and got clarity. Why didn\'t she demand an explanation that she absolutely deserved? And this is just some advice THERAPY is your friend! All of this pain could have so easily been avoided.""I have been in love with her since we met, though,""""No,"" he says quietly. ""In every universe, it\'s you for me. Even if it\'s not me for you.""""If it was possible to stop loving you, I would have managed it in that first year of desperately trying to. I\'m here. For good.""""Do you want me to promise that I will love you forever Harriett? Because I will.""The endingThe woman is a DOCTOR, she could set up a private little practice in Montana and be home for dinner every night. Do you know how much those loans are? Pottery isn\'t cutting it babe sorry! This wasn\'t as big of a deal but it did irk me.Ok so even though I did have my issues with this book, obviously, I still really thought it was beautiful. The writing was stunning, and I obviously cared about the story bc this review is a mile long (sorry about that) Will I ever read it again?

I\'ll have to split this into parts cause I had an issue with almost everything and anything !!! this is the last EH book I\'ll ever read so if u see me reading any of her new releases, ill fly out to the UK so u can beat the shit out me 🫶🏻let\'s talk about names for a sec, cause WHERE DOES SHE FIND THESE NAMES?? his name is literally WYNDHAM. Wyndfuckingham. It sounded so yeehaw but it ended up being an English name 🥹. This should\'ve been a sign for me to stop reading it *sighs* I should\'ve known at this point that he\'d be a loser. It\'s almost as if his parents set him up to be a failure.Also his SISTER\'S name was Michael ?? For half of the book I thought he was talking about his brother. Parth sounds like the Bengali word for fart so I couldn\'t take him seriously at all. (I\'ll have to confirm this with my parents tho).wynis such a pos, you can\'t convince me this man loved her for a single sec, they were together for almost 10 years and he broke up with her over the phone??? I\'m convinced the one and only reason he stayed with her for that long was bc she stroked his tiny, tiny dick and even tinier ego. I really really really tried to like him for the first 150 pages or so BUT PICKING A SIDE TABLE MADE OUT OF SHOE BOXES (thank u for reminding me rasa) FROM THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WAS MY LAST STRAW. You\'re not only dumb (he failed gen ed math, whatever that means) but you also collect other people\'s trash? no fucking thank you.""I\'ve worked so fucking hard on myself these last five months, Harriet, and I\'m doing well""up until this point I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, I told myself that he was probably as miserable but this was the 4th time he asked if she\'s happy TOO. Wdym ""too"" ? 😃🔪Also not him acting shady and smiling at his phone for 70% of the book and making her think he already has a girlfriend, just for the big reveal to be that he makes tables for a living 😃 YES TABLES.This man omg, I couldn\'t deal with his self pity anymore, I needed him stfu for a sec. Yes Wyn, everyone voted for u to be prom king bc they felt bad for u 🥺 BRING BACK TOXIC MASCULINITY I BEG, I don\'t wanna read about whiny manwhores ever again. Also not his mum putting pics up of him with other girls to ""promote"" him when harriet came over 😭😭 even she thinks he\'s a loser.Anyways has no one noticed how he distanced himself from her after he met martin? the one time she didn\'t coddle him when ppl were making him feel insecure? He was clearly waiting for a way out. ALSO, SHE SAID SHE SLEPT WITH SOMEONE AND HE DIDN\'T GET JEALOUS or react in any other way ???? His response was ""Look at me, I am yours"", more like ""i am yours to coddle🥺"". I\'ll stop here even tho I could write a book with all the reasons why I hate this man <3harrietor should I say harry 😃 Harriet *deep sigh* I was rooting for u girl, we were all rooting for u. I tried not to think of her as a doormat even tho she clearly was one bc she was about to become a freaking NEUROSURGEON ! Ofc she had to ruin everything and turn me against her. I didnt buy it for a sec that she hated her job and wanted to quit, I\'m 99.9% sure that the pos made her feel insecure for having a better job than him🙄 I refuse REFUSE to believe that she quit her job after 10+ of studying b-because she wanted to pursue pottery? POTTERY? she\'s not even good at it AND SHE KNOWS IT 🥹""I withdrew. But I\'m going to pay back the rest of the loan myself.""HOW HARRIET?

I had so many good things to say about her at the start but it all got cancelled out by her stupidity. And let\'s not talk about how wyn flat out told her to not move to Montana for him but she still did 🤣side charactersI was gonna write about each character individually but I\'m already sick of it. Her friends were so one dimensional. I knew I\'d hate Sabrina from the start, tbf I expected her to announce there\'ll be a double wedding 😭 so her going behind their backs didn\'t faze me at all. Her friends’ side story could\'ve been 20 pages long (max) if they just had one single conversation? Like farm girl tell your friends you\'re pregnant and Sabrina tell them you miss them? what was all that nonsense *rolling my eyes* Side note, parth was such a bad boyfriend. He was with sabrina for 10 years or whatever but got annoyed at her for reacting the way she did and didn\'t think of finding her after she was gone for the whole day? AND her friends had to tell him what to do.

i see right through me”, encapsulates this book perfectly.the loneliness; the bargaining with the universe; being loved and loving people; the fear of growing up; the fear of the possibility of never being happy; the perpetual struggle between living for yourself and the people you love; the terror of being an unhappy place to the people who love you; the fear of a job or something so permanent in your life being the wrong choice; everything around you changing; the nostalgia for moments you can never get back.harriet and i mirror each other in so many ways, and reading it in words across a book made me feel so seen and comforted.this book is for the girls who worry and worry, worry if they’re good enough, worry if they’ve achieved enough, worry if they’re enough. worry if they love people too much, worry if they love people too little. worry if they’re a catalyst for something bad that happens. worry if they’re too temporary or maybe too permanent. who have nostalgic happy moments on a loop in their heads. who feel the loneliness more with people around them than when they’re alone.⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻this part contains spoilers“stupid, stupid, stupid heart. don’t you know he hasn't been yours to cry over for a long time?”“it’s this feeling like the universe is compacting around me while something in my rib cage is expanding. i’m the culmination of their lost dreams, their missed other lives, and at the same time, they’re proud of me.”“i sit on the edge of the bed, feeling the loneliness swell, not knowing whether it's pressing against me from the outside or growing from within. either way, it's inescapable, my oldest companion.”preface: i rated this book on a completely different scale from emily henry’s other books or romance books in general. the reason why i loved this book so much, was not the romance but harriet’s introspection and character. its tones were much more subtle and nuanced, much reminiscent of a lit fic in some parts.harriet and i are vastly different in personality. she is much more outgoing, warmer, and patient than i am. but our fears and anxieties clicked, which emily henry did such an excellent job of writing about. especially her description of loneliness—i think it might be my favorite part she's written.wyn was an interesting character to me because he seemed so unlike other male protagonists. he feels like alex in a way, but the way his emotions and thoughts are wired is different. weirdly, i still don’t believe that he and harriet fully understand the reason that they broke up or they didn’t work out. they talked about their feelings, but did they truly hear one another? or did their worst fears get in the way of truly unpacking it and instead just tried to bandage it up as quickly as possible to appease one another?wyn’s constant need to feel loved or feel like he matters, and harriet’s constant fear that she will make people around her unhappy—i feel like it will eventually crash and burn again. wyn’s dad dying was a sort of superficial wound because it was an external circumstance/dent in their relationship. harriet quitting her job (although she was unhappy) also feels like a bit of an over-correction and a bandaid to the true problem.but i disregarded almost all of that during my read because of how much they love each other. it’s the first romance book i read where i could palpably feel how much and how desperately they love each other—not in an angsty or sexual way, but just how overwhelmingly they care about each other. and how intrinsically they understand each other (up until the aforementioned part). and also how they try their best to show that love in the way they think the other wants. the way wyn, in flashbacks, always reassures harriet that he will always love her. the way harriet represses all of her immense guilt so she can be the strong one for wyn. small gestures throughout the book that they are always trying to read and understand the other.that made this a very magical read, in a way.⸻���⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻this was literally AMAZING.i’ll be rereading again & writing a full review in a bit but all you have to know is that this has book lovers’ banter and beach read’s introspection. not so much a huge rom com like her other books but it’s much more mature and melancholy and UGH there are some passages i teared up at.5/5 for the moment <3thank you berkley for the arc!!⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻pre-readEMILY HENRY I WILL HIBERNATE UNTIL APRIL FOR YOU REALLY I SWEAR IT'S NO PROBLEM DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'when this book was first announced — before it had a title, or a cover, or a synopsis, or anything other than a weird beige placeholder and the words BY EMILY HENRY stamped on it — i made a solemn vow.that vow was this:i would trade my firstborn to read this book. i\'ll locate a baby just to exchange it for this.after i read it twice, i declared it worth it.after the third read, i have good news and i have bad news.the bad news is this might be my least favorite emily henry book.but the good news is that having a least favorite emily henry book is like having a bad slice of pizza, or seeing a just-okay movie in theaters with a big bucket of popcorn and a slushie the size of your head. in other words, even the disappointing experiences are better than most things in this earthly plane.emily henry books are always trying to balance a series of incredible things: a consuming romance; a bantery cast of characters; a charming setting; and an extremely daunting character arc that usually encapsulates a deep dark secret, a fatal flaw, daddy and/or mommy issues, and a shifting career path.this had all of those, like the creation from god it was. (tough way to reveal i\'m starting an emily henry-based house of worship.) it just didn\'t nail the balance. or the happily ever after.we have a cast of four friends who suck up all the character awesomeness quota, leaving none for our two main characters. we have a very soul-sucking (i\'m using the word suck too much for a book that is good) career / parent / self-esteem drama subplot that becomes the whole plot, leaving very little joy or yearning for the love story we may have thought we were in for.it also leaves some moments of frustration. how could these two people who love each other so much they need no other relationships or dreams or pastimes fail so hard to communicate? like as in never even consider it, let alone try it? how could pottery be a career path when its whole plot-based purpose is that its career-less-ness is what makes it nice? how many times can we have a patch of dialogue that culminates in one millennial joke before a scene change, leaving you like wait, that\'s it, we\'re just going to pretend the word ""kardashian"" is funny like this is a youtube video from 2013?most emily henry books give you a concerningly relatable protagonist (like, show-up-to-therapy-with-a-romance-novel-a-diagnosis-suggestion-and-a-dream level relatable), a hot love interest, their gooey steamy romance, and a dream job for your girl. it gives you, in other words, a fictional person you can see yourself in and the ability to believe that she-slash-you can have it all.this one doesn\'t quite get there.we still have more good things in between than most books can aspire to —\xa0maine! friendship! jokes! — but if you, say, decide to read this in a not at all ill advisedcry for helpemily henry binge reread, you\'re going to come away noticing this doesn\'t have the same magic as the others.but it is still a slice of pizza.bottom line: oops.3.5---------------------reread updateemily henry books are a precious and nonrenewable resource, to me.that\'s why i\'m rereading all of them like a test before i can read the new one.---------------------original reviewwhen this book was first announced — before it had a title, or a cover, or a synopsis, or anything other than a weird beige placeholder and the words BY EMILY HENRY stamped on it — i made a solemn vow.that vow was this:i would trade my firstborn to read this book. i\'ll locate a baby just to exchange it for this.and now that i have read this book twice and it is now out in the world, i have the following to say:worth it.emily henry is the unparalleled queen of banter and friend groups.does that make me miss the golden age of my life during which she was writing about both and also magic and also realism and also YA? sure. do i think that she is at her very best when she is writing for quirky teens? yeah. do i think her adult romances are often pale comparisons, in terms of their friendships and relationships and character depth and even humor and reality and emotion, to those books? for sure.but i\'ll take it.especially since there is angst and yearning here and that is really my only romance criteria!!also, anyone who is rating this book low because the Joy and Butterflies and Unicorn Smiles meter isn\'t turned up to 200%, you\'re a coward and i challenge you to a duel. romance can contain ranges of emotion, and actually be the better for it! and you\'re a dork for thinking anything else, even if the genre does have the words ROM and COM in it.but i digress.bottom line: i still believe i founded the emily henry fan club, and i remain a staunch member.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""— 4.5 stars ✰“before i even see him, my heart startssinging its favorite song. you, you, you.”who is stupid enough to think it‘s a happy fluffy book just because the book is calledhappy place? yeah, jokes on me, i‘m in fact stupid enough. soul crushing, heart wrenching, tear jerking,i am unwellthere is nothing moreheart wrenchingthan flashback pov‘s 😭 you‘re telling me i have to read about them falling in love just to be heart broken in the present scenes.. the audacity emily henry has. their meet cute was indeed very cute and i knew from that moment on, that my heart is going toBREAK🥲“do i make you anxious?”um yes, wyn. youdomake me anxious.i knew what was gonna come, i knew it. but nothing could've prepared me for the pain. reading about their breakup is some different kind of paini never want to experience ever again.forced proximity, second chance, fake dating.. full of tension and angst. there’s just something about past lovers that makes me so anxious but like in a good way you know.“he reaches over my shoulder and shuts the door himself. his hand stays there, to the left of my head.”— this is my last straw.

In my opinion, nobody can compete with her because she creates the best of the best. She not only plays the strings of my heart but is also a soul whisperer by writing the most unforgettable love stories.After reading this fantastic angsty romance/self-growth/beautiful friendship story, I decided it is my second favorite book by EH. ""Book Lovers"" is still my all-time favorite novel!I have to admit that this book is the sexiest, steamiest novel the author has written. The main reason is that the couple in the story has already known each other for ten years, and even though they broke up, the flame is still there. They are obviously soulmates! But what happened between Harriet and Wyn? They dated for nearly a decade, staying as fiancées for eight years. Why did Wyn end things with a four-minute-long phone call? Was it only long distance, did one of them cheat, or is there any crucial, life-changing reason that tore them apart?Harriet is invited to her Happy Place, where she has spent her most meaningful, unforgettable, sentimental moments with her best friends Sabrina, a hotshot lawyer, and Cleo, an aspiring farmer. Sabrina started dating their long-time friend and party boy Parth, and Cleo is happily farming and dating her hyperactive, extrovert lover Kimmie. Normally, their group turns into a party of five!Even though Harriet broke up with Wyn five months ago, they didn\'t come clean with their friends. Harriet is adamant about telling them at their special union in Happy Place, but she realizes that Sabrina already invited Wyn to their cottage, and Wyn acts like they\'re still together.Harriet finds out that Sabrina\'s father will sell Happy Place, and that this will be their last time together. An era of their lives is about to end. She also gives other shocking news. Harriet is a person who doesn\'t know how to fight, hates conflicts, and tries to please everyone around her. She doesn\'t want to create a disturbance by announcing their break-up, and Wyn seems to be on the same page.They should act like a couple for a week, and they will eventually come clean when their holiday is over. How hard could it be to stay in the same room, touching and kissing your ex in front of others when you are still harboring your unresolved feelings?Overall, this is an inspirational novel about self-growth, friendship, growing up, changing, grief, and mental illness. I returned to read some chapters over and over again. Harriet and Wyn might be my favorite couple that EH has created.Millions of thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing 2023\'s most anticipated book\'s digital copy with me in exchange for my honest review!If you’re interested in reading my extended book reviews, movie critiques, and hilarious astrology articles, be sure to check out my Medium account using the link below:medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'i feel like me and this book are somehow cosmically intertwined and our souls are one. this book was so taylor swift’s lover, folklore, midnights coded, tell me i’m wrong ?!there’s this unique connection i get from emily henry’s writing style that at this point should be studied. the way she not only describes feelings but gives me this ache that’s so deep and penetrating. it’s so tender omfgthrough out book we are consistently jumping from past to present timelines. and usually flashbacks bore me to no hell but not these. in fact, at some points i was rather craving the flashbacks more than the present moments.harriet and wyn are such unique characters compared to emily’s other characters. a lot of it is the same i can’t lie, but still, i get attached to them like glue. they feel so deeply and love so intensely. even though this entire book is all in harriet’s pov you still get a full characterization of wyn. and not only that. the side characters, this found family. all these characters have so much personality and depth. ugh i’d take a bullet for all of them fr.harriet is so me coded “he’s a golden boy. i’m a girl whose life has been drawn in shades of gray.” GORL IM CRYINGand wyn omg this sweetheart !! his kindness and selflessness is so precious and infectious. “i will always love you, that’s the point, harriet. it’s the only thing that’s ever come naturally to me.” GAHHHD i need him !!and as always emily henry books are gonna hit a little harder, linger a little closer, and stay a little longer than any other romance book. 1 star off only because i was semi bored in the middle and it felt a little flat in some parts. and the ending was so fucking rushed. i wished it gradually ended. nonetheless i still really enjoyed this book and highly recommend :)emily henry book rankings (this always changes, although beach read will most likely always stay #1)beach read, pwmov, book lovers, happy placewomen: nora, january, harriet, poppymen: gus, alex, charlie, wynthanks berkeley for the arc'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'unpopular opinion incomingfirst, let me say i am very happy thatso manypeople love this book already.i love that for you, i really do!✨i enjoyed and liked this book,buti didn’tloveit… and believe me, i tried.maybe my emotions are broken.maybe ireallydisliked the miscommunication.maybe the entire friend groupslightlyannoyed me.maybe the writing felt pretty average.maybe i went in with my expectations way too high.'}, {'rating': None, 'content': 'Wyn and Harriet are the perfect couple.

AND I DON’T CARE WHAT HE SMELLS LIKE ESPECIALLY NOT THE 250TH TIME.it was an active ick for me.wyn.look, he’s okay. he’s there. not gonna be there in my memory for long but whatever.in some ways i liked him. but not really anything worth mentioning.he was what this book was: meh.he's the most one-dimensional character in the book.wyn is a sexy lamp.(if you aren’t aware of what the sexy lamp is, please google it.)not to mention i feel like from what we got to see if their relationship, it was just a lot of:harry: “i don’t deserve you, blah blah blah”wyn: “i’ll love you forever in every universe, blah blah blah”like that exact situation happened at least 3 times. that’s not a lot, but it’s strange it’s happened thrice.the friend group/friend dramas/all that shit.i’m not sure what sense of surprise or whatever was meant to be here, but it was painfully obvious from the beginning that they all had their own shit going on. i gave sabrina the benefit of the doubt, but god she’s insufferable. i can understand some people needing more control and having that sort of personality quirk - we all have them - but this is an INNATE characteristic in a person andthey either would have run into a problem with it earlier if they had incompatible or clashing personalities for friends, or they would have made different friends.it’s so stupid that it’s happening now. and at the same time, i don’t care.i’m not going to lie i don’t really care about cleo either i barely remember anything about her, butkimmy? loml.someone said (i think ale?) in their review that they felt like they were third wheeling this friend group, like they were doing their own thing and as the reader you didn’t really have a reason to care, and that’s exactly how i feel!!the setting.hear me out. emily henry has previously had wonderful settings to all her novels, very atmospheric and interesting, and this one felt dull in comparison. it was there ofc, but i’m not gonna remember it.the ending.girl, please. i know that harry had problems with her job, but throughout the novel she reaffirmed that though it was hard, she enjoyed her job. THEN WHY IS SHE GIVING IT UP TO MOVE ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOR A RELATIONSHIP THAT MIGHT FALL APART AGAIN BECAUSE THEY CAN’T FUCKING TALK TO EACH OTHER? the math isn’t mathing.also, people can have hobbies and passions that exist outside of making money. that’s a normal healthy thing to do. this is like a larger issue relating to capitalism and triggering my fight or flight but not everything has to be mercenary. that so often ruins passions and it annoys me when so many people do that. why can’t shorty just like pottery??i’m sure i forgot something and i’ll definitely come update this but at the end of it i do still love emily henry as an author and i will continue to read whatever she publishes.i love how she creates stories differently with different plots and that the characters are all different and not carbon copies of each other.and as previously mentioned, i’d propose to her writing style.basically, i’m pretending my signed copy is of book lovers.------i'm leaving this pre-review bc its gorgeous:this acts as my love letter to emily henry, love of my life, so if you’re not emily henry, then please continue on your way-look, emily, my love, i’m sure i will adore this book and everything in it with all my heart just as i have all of your others. i would buy your grocery list. i would adore your grocery list. i would give up the first born child that i’m not planning to have for your grocery list.but girl i’m scared.one of my least favorite tropes is second chance romance. i won’t recover if this book ends up being the reason that we fall out of love. but i have faith in you and my preordered signed hardcover ♥""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'EH is a master at creating relationship dynamics that make you believe in them. i have read and rated all of her adult romances 5 stars because of her ability to make me fall in love with her characters and this book is no different.i adored reading harriet and wyns past chapters. they had such an enjoyable connection, which made reading their present day chapters so heartbreaking. their entire journey was one i felt super invested in from the beginning and was rooting for them every step of the way. and i really, really loved how EH wrote harriets feelings about wyn. very poetic. very romantic. i actually think this book has some of EHs better writing!so why is this not getting 5 stars then, you ask? it would have if harriet and wyn were the only focus of the book. but a significant part of the story is about their friend group as well, and the whole drama of “its our last summer and we are growing apart” just wasnt as appealing to me. i understand its necessity for the plot, but it just didnt interest me at all. should have know this book would have been a little different based on the cover featuring six people rather than just the classic two.but all in all, a sweet story and another win for EH.↠4.5 stars'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'i will never recover. ❤️\u200d🩹'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'TL;DR: Happy Place felt like an inside joke that I just didn’t understand. I was sitting there feeling awkward and out of place because a friend group I’m not a part of was the main character, not the relationship. It was an overall sad read, focusing on friendships drifting apart, parents getting old/dying, and failed expectations (imposed mainly by self doubt and pressure from friends and family). Maybe it’s cliche to admit, but I truly couldn’t care about 95% of this book. I didn’t buy their HEA. Further, Henry’s writing was way too dense and purple for what was already a heavy read. My happy place was the last page._____Happy Place is very similar to People We Meet on Vacation with the flashbacks and failed relationship that all hinged on a “mysterious” fight. Harriet was wishy washy and was too much of a people pleaser/ problem fixer and Wyn was so self deprecating. The rest of the friends weren’t interesting. They actually just sucked, especially Sabrina.It was more depressing than anything because it was less romance and more the trials and tribulations of being an adult. That shit is sad and not especially romantic. Plus you get flashbacks of Wyn’s very alive and healthy parents and then in the present his dad is dead and mother has Parkinson’s. It was just heavy all around. I’m not saying romances can’t deal with real issues and hard topics, but frankly it just didn’t make for an interesting read and it overshadowed the romance. The phrase “happy place” is basically a trigger for me now because it kept being repeated.As for the steam, the sex was delayed so long I got bored during the actual scene. They kept getting interrupted by people or or “sudden flashes of reality” during the first 80% of the book, which erased the sexual tension… so yeah not fun. It’s a flowery, vague, and short sex scene anyways. Only one scene. The payoff for waiting 9+ hours was the bare minimum.✨**SPOILERS**Further, I simply hated the reason for their breakup. It made me dislike Wyn idc he was too insecure and it being “it wasn’t you it’s me” is just something that I viscerally hate so much. I understand why he broke it off which even made sense and I don’t blame him for that, but the way he went about it was so frustrating and selfish.Wyn made the decision for the relationship without talking to Harriet and never really understood that. He does the same thing in the present too. “You can’t move to Montana because I know you better than you know yourself.” And both times Harriet blames herself!! She’s not blameless but come on girl. Also she wants to be a potter 😭😭? That was so fucking random lmao. Good thing she got scholarships I guess because throwing away your successful brain surgery career is wild behavior.**END OF SPOILERS**✨As for the writing, Henry uses so many adjectives and metaphors that I can’t help but feel claustrophobic. It’s definitely a personal preference but her writing is just so dense. This was my first EH audiobook since Beach Read and I really think it exacerbates the issue. The prose is purple and her metaphors have metaphors.She describes every little detail about every little thing and I got so overwhelmed. The amount of times this man bit his lip, licked his lip, twitched his lip…please god make it stop. My first thought 5% in was “wow, so many words.” So coupled with a boring plot about a group of friends I really didn’t like…it just really wasn’t the book for me.Overall, the audiobook in the PRH audio app kept going back several minutes randomly (idk what was going on) and I could barely tell I was rereading parts. The book just blended together in a big blob of blah. The narration itself was great but couldn’t save a boring book with an HEA I didn’t believe. This will be the last Emily Henry book I read. I gave it a shot because I love the cover and pink is my kryptonite. But no more. My happy place was the last page.⭐️⭐️.25/5 🌶️.5/5P.S. Wyn uses cinnamon toothpaste and clove deodorant which is serial killer behavior.Thanks to PRHaudio for an ALC. All opinions are honest and my own.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '“Love, I think. That’s new. And I’ll never be happy without it again.”So, I spent the last 100 pages or so crying. 😪Emily Henry did the damn thing. That ending was perfection. It was everything this story needed and what I needed.There’s this sense of warmth every time I pick up one of Emily Henry’s books.I can’t figure out whether this is a feeling specific to her books alone or the feeling you get when you are reading a story that’s about to become your favourite.It’s probably a combination of both.Her stories have all felt magical to me.Bar You and Me on Vacation, but we’re not talking about that book.I love how this felt so slice of life. So vulnerable, so intimate and human and ordinary in a way that’s true to real life.I know I’m reading something wonderful when I find myself pausing, taking a moment to sit with the story and reflect on my own life.It was pretty genius to divide this book into two different timelines.The‘Happy Place’chapters felt like I was visiting a really happy andsafeplace, happy moments that these characters experienced where everything felt right in the world.‘Real Life’felt as good as only real life can feel: not enough, bleak, where you find yourself drowning without even realising it, not knowing how you got there and with just enough happy moments felt in between to keep going.Both these timelines allowed us to truly get to know our characters deeply, when life brought out the best in them as well as when life wasn’t working in their favour.This story just brought out so many feelings within me that I can’t really articulate. There was almost a sense of desperation to it. By which I mean that these two characters were searching for something within themselves. Of worth, of love, belonging, to be seen as you are,to just be enoughand Emily Henry dissected and captured all of those uncomfortable emotions so well.There isn’t a thing I would change about it. Wyn and Harry honestly had what dreams are made off. Everything about them two together felt soul-level right. It was a treat to see them fall in love (again).The found family aspect represented belonging in a way that I think we all want to experience, with people who just know and accept you at your core.“You are in all my happiest places. You are where my mind goes when it needs to be soothed.”If, like me, you were doubting a happily ever after, then fear not. I wasfearing. Emily Henry put my feelings through the wringer. Uncalled for but it made that ending so much more worth it. It is a romance, at the end of the day. The most beautiful of love stories.Shoutout to Wyn’s parents. I want them to be my parents. 🥹*Trigger warnings for loss of a parent/depression.*———————————————Do you see this cover?

More thorough thoughts TK!'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '2 stars🩷i honestly never thought i would give emily henry a bad rating…but there was so much about this book that I did not like.the plot of the story is basically a second chance romance, between two ex fiancés, who reunite after being broken up for five months. the book has a dual timeline (past chapters and present chapters). in the past chapters, they show howwyn (H)andharriet (h)met, how their romance progressed and how it fell apart. while the present scenes show how they slowly start to reunite, while also trying to figure out why the breakup happened in the first place. at the same time, they hide their breakup from their best friends and continue to act like they’re together out of fear their friend group will fall apart.spoilers below👹first, i had a problem with the jumps between past and present. i have read books where this worked, but I found myself really wanting to get back to the present scenes and finding the flashback chapters to be very lackluster.one of the biggest problems i had with this book was the break up. throughout the book, the harriet explains the wyn broke up with her over the phone and it happened after some OM drama. essentially, she went out with a coworker and he kissed her. she didn’t kiss him back, pushed him away and she immediately called wyn to tell him. that’s when he broke up with her. to make it worse he immediately returns all the her stuff within days of the break up 😕for him to breakup with her like that after 8 years together 🫥also, wyn never pined or groveled. harriet ended up being the one that groveled and even tried to “get revenge” by looking hot, grinding on him when they were faking it, etc. i guess this was a way to get a ride out of him but it made no sense when she didn’t do anything wrong. like what is this–“What about you?” he rasps. “Are you with him?”There it is. Acid rises through my stomach. A cleaving goes through my chest.I refuse to cry. Not over something that happened five months ago. Not over someone who’s already told me he doesn’t want me.“That’s what you think of me?” I scoot back from him until the wall meets my back. “You still honestly believe I cheated on you, and beyond that, you think I’d turn around and do it to someone else too.”“That’s not what I’m saying,” Wyn says, his voice gravelly. “I’m not accusing you of anything! I’m trying to ask\xa0.\xa0.\xa0.”“Trying to ask what, Wyn?” I demand.“If you’re happy,” he says. “I want to know that you’re happy too.”wyn is definitely emily henry’s worst hero. i hated that he would tell harriet that he was finally happy and then be glad when she lied and said she was too. i felt like wyn didn’t even try to question it. i do think he was happier now than during his relationship. during the end of their relationship his dad died and his mom was diagnosed with parkinsons. after they breakup he was finally on medication for his recently diagnosed depression, he moved back to montana to be with his mom and finally found a job he loved, so I understand why he was happier now than when he was dating harriet.but he dated her for 8 years but couldn’t tell she was actually miserable??? i think he wanted to be blind regarding that so he wouldn’t feel guilty about his newfound happiness in life.“It’s amazing. Seeing you like this. So happy.”He studies me for a beat before dropping his gaze on a nod. “I am. I’m really happy.”[…]“You too, right?” He matches my gaze.That seesaw feeling rocks through me. “Yeah,” I say. “Me too.”“Good,” he says softly.he also broke up with her because she couldn’t pick a wedding date…YOUR DAD LITERALLY JUST DIED HOW TF WAS SHE JUST GONNA BE LIKE “ohhh i want a spring wedding and let’s spend money NEITHER of us have”when they finally get back together at the end of the book, it felt like nothing had changed. part of the reason why they broke up is when they moved to san francisco for harriet’s residency and he hated feeling inferior to her friends, having shitty jobs and being away from his mom. in the end of the book, harriet quits her residency and moves to montana to make pottery.i really can’t make this upaselliesaid, in this economy???i mean, wyn had to have known harriet would be very busy?? SHE’S IN RESIDENCY 🧍🏻\u200d♀️ she’s not gonna have the time and energy to talk about their relationship problems. i didn’t like how EH tried to justify harriet needing to quit just because she didn’t think she was good at it, she hates the direness of it and she hates the smell of antiseptic…it felt like she decided to start making pottery as a form of income overnight.then harriet tells her parents “don’t worry, i’m gonna pay off the loans myself” yeah maybe after 200 years 😵\u200d💫and if she doesn’t want to be a surgeon, have her become a family practitioner or something??? becoming a neurosurgeon isn’t the end alli understand that she didn’t actually like what she was doing but for her to just move across the country to be with wyn was part of the reason they broke up in the first place??? it made zero sense to me.honestly, when they reunited it felt like he was very indifferent about their break up. it seemed like harriet was the one suffering and he didn’t struggle at all. i think this book desperately needed wyn’s POV so we could try to understand the reasoning for his actions. why did he lie to harriet, why didn’t he break up with her sooner, why didn’t he communicate with her better, why the FUCK did he breakup with her over the phone??? his mental health at that time in his life needed to be explored more for me to understand his thought process. everything about wyn was very flat. nothing about his life was explored, which should have been if that was a major reason for the break upalso who tf tells someone they will always love them when they’re broken up? it’s not like he had to change before he fully committed to her again🤨 NOTHING CHANGED BETWEEN HIM SAYING I LOVE YOU AND THEM GETTING BACK TOGETHERmake it make sense EH, pleasethe side characters were also boring and I couldn’t find myself giving any shit about their problemsthis was entirely forgettable but i still love you EH 🫶🏻'}]"

Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass, #3)
",Sarah J. Maas,4.46,1148545,293986,"Young Adult, Romance, Fantasy, Fiction, Magic, Fae, Young Adult Fantasy",576,02-09-2014,"Celaena has survived deadly contests and shattering heartbreak-but at an unspeakable cost. Now, she must travel to a new land to confront her darkest truth . . . a truth about her heritage that could change her life-and her future-forever. Meanwhile, brutal and monstrous forces are gathering on the horizon, intent on enslaving her world. Will Celaena find the strength to not only fight her inner demons, but to take on the evil that is about to be unleashed?","[{'rating': 5, 'content': '""Enemy. Lover.Queen.""Heir of Fireis undoubtedly one of the best books I\'ve ever read. It certainly will be my favorite book of the year. It is gloriously long and kept me occupied for an entire day (night hours included) making me crave to find out more, but also stop reading so that the book won\'t end just yet.You think you know Celaena from reading the first two books, right? Oh, but you\'re so so wrong. In this book we see her more than broken, relentlessly blaming herself for the fates and deaths of her beloved ones. She takes down her every shield, leaving nothing behind to shed her emptiness threatening to shatter her from the inside out. I believe this was her turning point, the true crossroad in her life, making her see, accept and embrace all that pain, regret and self-loathing she carefully kept hidden inside her soul, etched into her dire and gruesome memories.“You collect scars because you want proof that you are paying for whatever sins you\'ve committed. And I know this because I\'ve been doing the same damn thing for two hundred years. Tell me, do you think you will go to some blessed Afterworld, or do you expect a burning hell? You\'re hoping for hell--because how could you face them in the Afterworld?”And gods, what memories and past. We are able to witness how she became Celaena Sardothien, how her life changed forever on that fateful night ten years ago. But by facing all that sorrow and darkness, she\'s making a stand. She\'s slowly becoming a queen, one more powerful and deadlier that you could ever imagine.Her character development is phenomenal, because through her new experiences she is stronger, wiser and more determined. Her fierceness was awe-inspiring and I loved that she\'s still the same stubborn, snarky and brave young woman, maybe with her ego a little bruised. She\'s not proud of who she\'s become, abandoning her kingdom and not fighting for rebuilding it for the past ten years, but she\'s ready to throw herself into battle to win back her land. To say that she\'s badass would be an understatement.Celaena makes the transition from assassin to queen with the help of Rowan, a Fae Prince and my favorite new addition to the series. Not that he is so eager to help, but in order to find answers about the Wyrdkeys and how to destroy them, she has to be worthy of entering Doranelle, the land where Queen Maeve awaits her to answer her questions. May I shout something?I LOVE ROWAN WHITETHORN. In the beginning, he\'s infuriatingly patient and stubborn, brooding and secretive. But when he opens up? And when he actuallysmiles?!?Laughs?? Scrap me off the floor cause I am hyperventilating.“Gods, he was brilliant. Cunning and wicked and brilliant.Even when he beat the hell out of her. Every. Damn. Day.”He\'s an alpha-male in all his glory, with the kickass moves that would bring Celaena\'s to shame. He\'s scary and intense, protective and defying, caring, but lethal when it comes to his enemies. Rowan is the no-nonsense type and I was glad there is finally someone who doesn\'t put up with Celaena\'s bullshit. She throws a verbal punch? He throws one that will leave her with a black eye for the entire week. But they develop a friendship and something so important on the intimate level (not talking about romance) that it will warm your heart to realize that our girl finally has someone to fully rely on. No secrets, no barriers, no judging left between them. They would die for each other, kill for each other, fight for each other. And when they work together, as a pair, as a team, they\'re astounding and terrifying.“I claim you, Rowan Whitethorn. I don\'t care what you say and how much you protest. I claim you as my friend.”Dorian Havilliard is the same swoon-worthy, sentimental, humble (yet a bit arrogant as well) young prince. He will win your heart regardless of the ""team"" you\'re in, because in the end he stands up to his father in a glorious way that had me cheering for him. He is way more mature, weary of everyone and everything and you can see him becoming a true worthy king right before your eyes. A lot of heartbreak and despair was in store for him and I guarantee it will all leave you in a pile of overwhelming feels.In addition to his wonderful character development, Dorian is moving on from Celaena. And I\'m not sure I like who he\'s moving on with. Heck, I don\'t like that he\'s actually moving on. Makes the whole Dorian/Celaena shipping a bit harder. But truth be told now, as much as I was against his new lady Sorscha, I was glad he got a little happiness and support to fight his growing loneliness, worries and magic. And you want to know why? Because freaking Chaol Westfall pretty much abandoned his friend when he needed him the most.Yeah, you read that right. Dedicated, loyal, selfless Chaol was so unable to make up his damn mind that I was uncounsciously pulling my hair. I was very much irritated with him until the very end when he came to his senses. In the aftermath ofCrown of Midnight, his friendship with Dorian is left in shambles and things don\'t get prettier in this book. They grow estranged, but I\'ll give it to the captain that he has only the prince\'s safety and freedom in interest. But keeping secrets, judging, not being able to accept Celaena\'s and Dorian\'s powers -- all these things make me wonder if he has any shot left at our heroine\'s heart, because whereas Celaena would always pick him, Aelin would not.“As for Celaena,” he said again, “ you do not have the right to wish she were not what she is. The only thing you have a right to do is decide whether you are her enemy or her friend.”We meet awesome warrior Aedion Ashryver, Celaena\'s cousin and childhood best friend. He\'s all deadly smiles, muscles and wild behavior. Aedion is daring, clever and doesn\'t give a rat\'s ass about anyone but himself. Or so they say. But he\'s dead set on taking down the King of Adarlan from the inside. When he finds out Aelin is alive, he makes it clear that he would move mountains in order to see his true queen back in Terrasen. He\'s loyal, determined, skilled and I hope he reunites with Celaena sooner rather than later, because he is in a pretty bad place at the end of the book.""A cry went up from the witches, save for the Thirteen—¬who stayed cool and quiet. They did not need to cheer, for they ¬were immortal and infinite and gloriously, wonderfully deadly.”Another addition to the newbie characters is Manon Blackbeak, heir of the Blackbeak coven of the Ironteeth witches and leader of the Thirteen. The witches play a big role in the King\'s newest and darkest plans by being the riders of the wyverns he has created and Manon wants nothing more than to lead them into battle as Wing Leader. She wants to prove herself and although she is a bloodthirsty, wicked creature, I completely loved her. She\'s by no means a villain, just a different kind of heroine, firm and unyielding, with great ambition. Her encounters and silent dialogues with Abraxos cracked me up, because in that moments you could glimpse (besides the wyvern\'s total awesomeness) how Manon starts believing there\'s a chance she has a heart and soul and that her grandmother\'s rules might not be the best to follow.“Witches didn\'t need blood to survive, but humans didn\'t need wine, either.”The King of Adarlan is still the biggest bastard I\'ve had the (dis)pleasure of reading. I loathe the guy with every fiber of my being. He is wicked to the core, manipulative and selfish to no end. No, not just selfish, but greedy. Greedy for everything and anything, exactly like a monster. And what he did at the end, to my poor baby Dorian, made me wish that once Celaena comes back -- because she will come back -- she won\'t kill him. Oh no, I want her to keep him locked in a basement, to visit him everyday and torture him until he breaks, only to do it all over again the next day, because killing him would be too much of a mercy for the deeds he has done.The other secondary characters were very well developed: the Ironteeth witches, Ren Allsbrook, Emrys, Luca and Maeve -- they were a testimony to SJM\'s awesome writing skills. And I might add that for me the writing style was slightly different. Improved. Better. More realistic, if you wish. There was a certain ease with which she used words that enchanted you completely. Plus, the swearing. I don\'t mind it one bit, but am I the only one that noticed it appeared more often than in the first two books? Matured characters, matured world, matured language, I guess.The atmosphere is darker and the pace is thrilling, allowing you to breath for a bit before another near-death encounter or epic battle starts. The world-building was another winner, as we were able to see Wendlyn, Doranelle, the Ferien Gap and Adarlan again. We learn about the past, we meet Queen Maeve (who\'s quite a manipulative bitch), we run from terrifying creatures and we accompany Celaena as she masters her powers.There isn\'t so much romance in the air, besides Dorian\'s plotline, because it\'s the last thing in our character\'s mind. And honestly, I don\'t really know who Celaena is going to end up with. Chaol still has issues with her and Dorian is currently viewing her as his friend, but things could still drastically change since there are 3 more books. It seems that even Aedion, her cousin, might have a shot since he wouldn\'t deny anything his queen would ask of him. And then there\'s Rowan who I\'m not sure will actually have a romantic involvement with Aelin, but it\'s worth hoping for -- they would be unstoppable.“He would not apologize for today, or yesterday, or for any of it. And she would not ask him to, not now that she understood that in the weeks she had been looking at him it had been like gazing at a reflection. No wonder she had loathed him.”In terms of plot, you could say it\'s action-driven, but I beg to differ: the character development plays a part as big as the twists and turns and fights. It sure keeps you at the edge of your seat, courtesy of Sarah J. Mass\' amazing writing, and makes you shudder at some new evil creatures or at the violence, but I basically viewHeir of Fireas Celaena\'s healing journey, one necessary to fully accept her legacy.“So you’d save another land, but not yours. Why can’t your friend save her own kingdom?”“Because she is dead!” She screamed the last word so loudly it burned in her throat. “Because she is dead, and I am left with my worthless life!”TheThrone of Glassseries slowly becomes a younger version ofGame of Thrones(with less deaths, but keep in mind that there are worse fates than death...) and I couldn\'t be happier. With the same complexity, a gut-wrenching intensity and an amazing world,Heir of Firebrings out the big guns: twists, emotional punches, tearjerkers and amazing characters, not to mention the wonderfully built world. It\'s definitely the best one from the series yet and a total game-changer, so don\'t be surprised if it will keep you enthralled from start to finish. Fantasy to its finest, a story with heroes and monsters, Fae and humans, life and death. Read it the second it hits shelves, cause you won\'t be disappointed (unless you\'re the type that can\'t stomach the idea of enduring another year for the next book and to whom I recommend waiting a bit longer, because there is one hell of a cliff-hanger).If you\'re looking for anything ToG related then check out thisThrone of Glass fansite.ENJOY!<3'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5/5 ⭐Full review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolf🐺*stares blankly in space trying to think a way of living life now after this book destroyed me*I just don’t even know what can I say about this book. It’s like everything I try to say gets validated and discarded at the same time. It feels frustrating and I am still not going to cope with it any time soon.It is alwaysveryhard for me to write reviews for theThrone of Glassbooks. I mean, it is somehow impossible. I thoughtCrown of Midnightwas hard to write, but holy gods, I think this one beat it (I don’t even want to think in how many ways the rest of the series is going to murder me).A very important part of this book is Rowan Whitethorn, a Fae warrior prince who will initially seem the most obnoxious creature on earth, but until the end of this book, you’ll fall completely in love with him. His harshness and heart of stone are only the veils that cover Rowan’s true spirit – a gentle spirit; an honourable man with a true sense of loyalty.„Loyalty is earned, not given.”Another important part of the book is the apparition of Aelin’s long lost cousin, general Aedion Ashryver. His unshakable loyalty for his beloved cousin made him do atrocious things in the past ten years, but he still believes in Aelin’s return and is ready to sacrifice anything and everything to help her reign over her people, freeing them all, saving their lives.And if you thought I was done with important parts, you’re awfully wrong. There is yet another very important part of the book and that is the magnificent appearance of the Ironteeth witch Manon Blackbeak. I don’t know how this happened, maybe I am the only one, maybe I am the one of the few, maybe the one of the many, but I love Manon. I really do love her character and her story and it makes me feel so attached to her knowing all the wicked things she and her coven went through in order to become these lethal creatures, heartless and soulless. Let’s give a sister the appreciation she deserves!I am sorry to announce though that throughout the book the most boring of all characters had to be Chaol. I really am sorry, I actually skipped a couple of his chapters.Oops.Until the end of the book though, my heart got so warm with love for him and also for my pretty prince Dorian that I just couldn’t take it anymore. Don’t want to sound too much, but boy, Chaol and Dorian really turned out to be the real OTP of the whole bookand I am living for it.As you already know (and if you don’t let me enlight you), I have a tendency to infiltrate someRomanianismsin my reviews. I know I am the only one in this whole wide world to make connections between a book I read and my language and culture but IT IS TRUE AND IT REALLY GOES RIGHTin my heart.InHeir of Fire, there is a particular celebration going on on some point in Mistward and that one is called Beltane, which consists of bonfires being ignited at night for some brave people who are ready to jump across them for good luck and good lives. Here in Romania, we have this very same tradition (minus the music and the food, we only get sweets while attending). Our celebration is calledFocul lui Sumendru, a Romanian tradition who is two thousand years old and it pretty much is the same as Beltane, but as in book Beltane is held in spring, ourFocis held in autumn, in order to keep the autumn steady as long as it can, to belate the harsh winter. Pretty cool, yeah, but DO NOT TRY IT AT HOME!Okay, now that I’ve also opened the celebration discussion and also closed it I would very much like to mention that it is very imperious (if you allow me to say so) that youdo notread this book in public! It gets very emotional and if you are like me, then it is a very complicated job to contain yourself while reading it.Seriously, my face almost cracked while trying to repress a very unladylike word from getting out my throat.Also, for my Romanians - Have you ever experiencedFocul lui Sumendru?'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I\'m not sure what to say aboutHeir of Fire. Perhaps I don\'t need to say anything beyond:it took memonthsto read it.And I am the kind ofcrazypassionate reader that finishes good books in a day or two. It\'s been a while since a book took me longer than a week to read.So basically:I liked but had issues withThrone of Glass.I absolutely LOVEDCrown of Midnight.But this book... this book was so... bloody... sloooooowwwwwww.I wanted to DNF it so bad. I kept moving it between my ""currently reading"" and ""on hold"" shelves. I kept wondering if I could possibly just skip the last two thirds of this book and somehow pick the story up in next installment (I was informed that I could not). I have invested so much time and love in this series and these characters that I simply had to make myself finish... but holy shit, it was such a struggle.The majority of this book?So Maas tries to experiment with a bit of something different here and it neither a) works, nor b) fills me with much confidence for the state of the rest of the series. I\'m seeing the way this whole thing is going...Book one was fantasy-lite with a simplistic plot, filled with characters lacking in any real development to distinguish them from others in the genre, but it was fast-paced, sugary entertainment. Book two cranked it up several notches; here the characters became more fleshed out and nuanced, the plot was equally engaging but more complex and clever, and there was way more badassery. No complaints at all. And then we arrive at book three.Heir of Firefeels like an attempt to be more sophisticated. It is well-written, contains several stories told through constantly changing POVs, and it is more than a hundred pages longer. And it is far far slower. Maas sacrifices everything deliciously fast-paced and compelling about her series in the first half so we can be introduced to a whole new cast of characters we don\'t care about, be taken through different (all boring) perspectives, and emerge feeling like we\'ve read an extremely long filler book.Dorian\'s new romance only served to remind me why I found him unbearably boring in the first book. Celaena - now in Wendlyn - meets a whole set of new people who failed to make any kind of impression on me. Even Chaol - whom I absolutely loved in both other books - lost his charm somewhere amid his own boring plot line. And just when I thought I might be starting to get invested in one of the stories, the chapter would end and I would leave the story of interest for at least fifty pages, guaranteeing that I would no longer care when we finally returned.The most annoying thing about this book is how it wasn\'t even consistently slow. We\'d get tiny little tidbits of awesome that would last a mere two or three pages and I would sit up a bit straighter and think ""This is it. Finally we\'re getting to the good stuff..."" until I realised it was just a false alarm and the story was still boring.If I\'m to give credit where it\'s due, I will say that I like the way Maas portrays friendships and makes them as important - if not more important - than the romantic relationships. It\'s an area of YA so often neglected and I find it especially refreshing to see a platonic relationship between young male and female characters crafted so well.I will be reading the next book just because I have to give it a shot, but my expectations have been significantly lowered.Blog|Leafmarks|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Tumblr'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'SHE WOULD NOT BE AFRAID!!!!!!!!! 😭😭😭❤️\u200d🔥❤️\u200d🔥❤️\u200d🔥❤️\u200d🔥'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Sarah J Mass is a capital G God.

And tell you what? It actually exceeded my, admittedly, already high expectations! Yes, Sarah! You did an amazing job with this one! I was hooked right from the beginning and I didn’t want to stop to read this damn book!!!I loved this book, I loved it so freaking much! It was so, so, so, so, SOOO, good!!!And I was happy with it, I was SO happy with it!UNTIL…UNTILthe last 20 pages hit me!! ARGH!!! T_TI thought I’d be able to write about “Heir of Fire” without getting all too emotional but as it seems all my plans and good intentions just went out of the window. I can’t write about this book without getting emotional! I just can’t! It was too much!! That ending was too much!!! WHY?WHY THE FREAKIDY FREAKING HELL, SARAH!!!!????How could you do this to me??!!HOW?!I LOVE THIS BOOK!BUT I HATE THIS ENDING SO MUCH!I hate it,I love it,I hate that I love it,I love that I hate it!ADSFJKLMNÖ ADKFASLDFJASDKFASDK!*throws book against the wall**a second time**for good measure*Okay, I think I’m ready to continue now. *takes deep breath and collects herself*All right! Let’s do this!Just like with “Crown of Midnight” I won’t waste your time by writing about the plot. It’s way too complex to explain it without any spoilers and because of that, I guess it might be best if I just go for another round of “Keyword Boggle”!It was so much fun the last time around, wasn’t it? ;-PSo here I go: Celaena, Dorian, Chaol, Rowan, Aelin, Manon, Abraxos, Sorscha, The King, magic, faeries, witches, darkness, fire, ice, wind, a kitchen, a healer, an apartment, blood, murder, and let’s not forget about the black stones. XDI guess by now you could write your own book! *lol*We’re still speaking about Sarah’s book though, so I’ll head directly into the characters section and won’t keep you in suspense any longer.The characters:Do I still have to say it? Yes? Okay! Beware of my characters section because it’s known as the spoilery spoiler section of my reviews! Don’t read on, close your eyes, eat an ice, please think twice, I’m not nice, my reviews have spice. And spoilers, lots of spoilers, but you already know that or you wouldn’t have continued to read that bad rhyme! ;-PCelaena:”So you’d save another land, but not yours. Why can’t your friend save her own kingdom?”“Because she is dead!” She screamed the last word so loudly it burned in her throat. “Because she is dead, and I am left with my worthless life!”*sighs deeply* Oh, Celaena! How much pain does this poor girl have to endure? It hurt to read about her feelings after Nehemia’s death, it hurt to read how much she ached and wished she could have been someone else. That she could have saved her friend. That Nehemia would live instead of her. That Chaol would have trusted her. That he would have told her… Oh boy, Celaena’s heart was a black void of desperation and pain that only seemed to get worse before it even got a chance to get better. In the end it did get better though and I’m so happy about that! She finally found her inner strength and she accepted her heritage! Which is awesome, because I really can’t wait for her to kick some ass! *lol* Heaven knows the King’s behind is already a formidable target and please Sarah if there is any justice in your world you’ll let him burn for what he did!!! You’ll let him suffer for all the pain he caused!!! I can’t wait to see Celaena’s power unleashed! Guess the palace is going to be “hot stuff” soon! ;-P”He had chosen the king. Even though he’d claimed he loved her, he still loyally served that monster. Maybe she had been a fool for letting him in, for dreaming of a world where she could ignore the fact that he was captain to the man who had shattered her life again and again.””No, all she could see were the slaves she’d left behind, the ashy mountains and those mass graves they dug every day, the faces of her people, who had worked beside her – her people whom she had left behind. Whom she had let herself forget, had let suffer; who had prayed for salvation, holding out hope that someone, anyone would remember them.She had abandoned them – and she had been too late.””She would not let that light go out. She would fill the world with it, with her light – her gift. She would light up the darkness, so brightly that all who were lost or wounded or broken would find their way to it, a beacon for those who still dwelled in that abyss. It would not take a monster to destroy a monster – but light, light to drive out darkness.She was not afraid.”Chaol:”He was afraid of what they would do to his kingdom. Because this was still his kingdom. He was working for Dorian, not Aelin – not Aedion. And he didn’t know where all of this put him.”YESH! I know it was a long and hard way for Chaol but as it seems he’s finally on the right track! I loved that he began to question everything. He was so insecure and hurt that he had no other choice than to face his outlook on things and in the end this eventually forced him to see behind the kings carefully kept façade. Which is awesome, because I know deep down within him Chaol is a very good man!!! He was just completely oblivious to the fact that the served a monster! Still, I’m glad he decided for Dorian and I swear if Celaena and Chaol don’t do anything about this damn ending, I’m going to riot!!!! CHAOL you gotta help your Prince and rightful king!!!!”I will not turn my back on my kingdom or my prince,” Chaol snapped. “I will not fight in your army and slaughter my people. And I will not break my vow to my father.” His honor might very well be all he would have left after the end of this.Aedion was quiet long enough that Chaol got up to leave. But then the general said, “What would you have given – just to see her again?”Chaol couldn’t turn around as he said, “It doesn’t matter now.”Chaol kept his sword drawn. “I will not go to Anielle,” he growled. “And I will not serve you a moment longer. There is one true king in this room – there always has been. And he is not sitting on that throne.”Dorian:”Once Dorian might have already said something about it. But having magic, getting drawn into whatever mess Celaena was in, seeing that other world in the secret tunnels … all of that had changed everything. The best he could do these days was maintain a low profile – to keep his father or anyone else from looking too long in his direction.”WHY SARAH??!! WHYYYYY? *breaks down and sobs*Why do you have to use him as a human punching bag? Dorian is so decent and compassionate; he doesn’t deserve to be broken!!! First you hurt him by finding out about Chaol’s and Celaena’s secret, then you kill off his girlfriend and in the end you even let him be forced into the Kings slavery!!??LIKE SERIOUSLY!!?? WTFH!!?? WTF!!?? I CAN’T WITH THIS ENDING!!! I JUST CAN’T!!! HE SUFFERED ENOUGH!!!I don’t even want to know what is going to happen now that he’s wearing this freaking collar! He saved Chaol’s life! GODDAMNIT!!! GIVE MY BOY A BREAK!!! Sarah, I swear it here and now if Dorian isn’t saved by the end of book 4 I won’t continue to read this series. I just won’t! I know it’s the author’s right and decision to kill off characters or to make them suffer as they please, but I just can’t take it anymore. Dorian is my cutiepie and cinnamon roll and I think my heart hurts enough! I survived 3 books of ACOTAR watching how my precious Lucien went through hell and I just can’t take this anymore. Lucien never got his happily ever after and it still hurts!!! So no, sorry but no! If Dorian isn’t at least halfway alright after “Queen of Shadows” then I’m quitting this series! Period! I made up my mind! There was so much potential to give Dorian’s character a chance to evolve and to be awesome and interesting! So much raw magic that could have been used, but all that happened was that Sorscha died and Dorian sacrificed himself for Chaol. I’m pissed, I’m majorly pissed! And coming from me that means a lot! So yeah, this wrong is better set right or I’m quitting! I’m serious and I mean it! This said:#TeamDorian forever and for always!!! <333”He’d been a fool once, swearing he would tear the world apart for Celaena. A boy in love with a wildfire – or believing he was in love with one.””Because you’re not really scared of those things, are you? No – it’s what they represent. The change. But let me tell you,” Dorian breathed, his magic flickering and then subsiding in a flash of pain, “things have already changed. And changed because of you. I have magic – there is no undoing that, not getting rid of it. And as for Celaena …” He clamped down on the power that surged as he imagined – for the first time, he realized – what it was to be her. “As for Celaena,” he said again, “you do not have the right to wish she were not what she is. The only thing you have a right to do is decide whether you are her enemy or her friend.””We’re all risking something.” There was so little of the friend he’d grown up with. The prince glanced at his pocket watch. “I need to go.” Dorian stalked to the stairs, and there was no fear in his face, no doubt, as he said, “You gave me the truth today, so I’ll share mine: even if it meant us being friends again, I don’t think I would want to go back to how it was before – who I was before. And this …” He jerked his chin towards the scattered crystals and the bowl of water. “I think this is a good change, too. Don’t fear it.”Aedion Ashryver:”Handsome was a light way of describing what Aedion was. Overwhelming was more like it. Towering and heavily muscled, Aedion was every inch the warrior rumor claimed him to be.”I like Aedion! I like him a lot!!! He’s such a tortured soul and he tried everything possible in order to protect his people! He was an intriguing new character and I can’t wait to see more of him. I really liked his interactions with Dorian because they were so much fun! *lol* Those two have a lot of potential to become close friends, but I guess the ending of this book kind of nullified that possibility. Still, I want Aedion’s noble and brave soul to be rescued as well and I don’t even want to know what the king is going to do with him. T_T I hope Aelin returns soon because her boys definitely need her right now! Poor Aedion, he waited for so long!!! And if I’m already at it! He saved Chaol’s ass too, so Chaol better get his groove on! He needs to make plans to save him as well! XD”Cousin – that had been his most beloved title. Cousin, kin, protector. Those were the secret names he harboured deep within, the names he whispered to himself when the northern wind was shrieking through the Staghorns.””Aelin would come back from Wendlyn, no matter what the captain believed. Aelin would come back, and when she did … With every breath, Aedion felt that lingering scent wrapping tighter around his heart and soul. When she came back, he was never letting her go.””All you monsters can burn in hell. Because my queen is coming – and she will spike you to the walls of your godsdamned castle. And I can’t wait to help her gut you like the pig you are.” He spat at the king’s feet, right on top of the fake ring that had stopped bouncing.Rowan:”She noticed then that his arms were bandaged, and more bandages across his broad chest peeked up from beneath his shirt. She’d burned him again. And yet he had held on to her – had run all the way here and not let go once.”The fierce, broody and intense warrior! I like him even though I have to admit that his abilities as a teacher kind of lack experience. *lol* Still, he’s a decent fae and despite the way he acted at the beginning of the book his heart actually seems to be in the right place. I loved that he took care of Celaena once he realised why she’s so broken and I suppose their fight at the beginning was kind of necessary. They both needed to let off some steam. XD I genuinely hope we’ll see more of him in the next book, because I feel like there is so much more to tell! ;-)”How – how did you come back from that kind of loss?”“I didn’t. For a long while I couldn’t. I think I’m still … not back. I might never be.”She nodded, lips pressed tight, and glanced toward the window.“But maybe,” he said, quietly enough that she looked at him again. He didn’t smile, but his eyes were inquisitive. “Maybe we could find the way back together.”Manon:Silent as death, Manon slid up behind him. The fool didn’t even know she was there until she brought her mouth close to his ear and whispered, “Wrong kind of witch.”I’M IN LOVE WITH MANON BLACKBEAK!!!This woman is so savage and fierce! I love it! *lol* As it seems for once my prayers were answered! I got more of the iron teeth witches and I loved every single chapter! XD Manon is so damn amazing! I just couldn’t get enough of her and followed her storyline closely. Truth be told, I just want to lean back and watch how her and Abraxos change the world. Haha! I disliked Manon’s grandmother a lot though and even though she became Wing Leader I’m pretty sure there will be some major estrangement in the future. Still, I loved Manon’s connection with Asterin and her Thirteen and I really hope they’ll always be at her side. Maybe Petrah will join them one day? Idk! I truly hope she’ll be fine some day because I really liked her too. >_<”You’re mine,” Manon said to him.The wyvern blinked at her, Titus’s blood still dripping from his cracked and broken teeth, and Manon had the feeling that he had come to the same decision. Perhaps he had known long before tonight, and his fight with Titus hadn’t been so much about survival as it had been a challenge to claim her.As his rider. As his mistress. As his.””And Manon, because no one was watching, because she did not care, flung out her arms as well and savoured the freefall, the wind now a song in her ears, in her shriveled heart.””You touch him again,” Manon said, “and I’ll drink the marrow from your bones.”The friendships & ships:Chaol & Dorian:He met Dorian’s gaze. There was nothing kind in it. But Dorian said, “I’m trying, Chaol.”Trying, because Chaol’s not consulting him on the plan to get Celaena out of Adarlan had been a breach of trust, and one that shamed him, though Dorian could never know that, either. “I know.”Oh, those two broke my heart! I really wanted them to solve their problems and then this damn ending came along!!! ARGH! They need a chance to fix all this! Sarah give them a chance, please!? They deserve it! AndOMG Chaol told Dorian that he loves him!!!Way too late but he did it!!! <33 I just want my two boys to be happy and friends again. *sobs* They both suffered enough in those last two books, they really deserve some peace!!! And to take away their chance to make amends!! So mean, Sarah! So, so mean!!! >_<”You think I’d run to my father?” The words were barely more than a strangled whisper as the temperature plummeted.Chaol stepped forward, putting himself between Aedion and Dorian, his palms exposed. Placating. “I can’t afford to guess – to hope. Even with you.””You cannot pick and choose what parts of her to love.” He pitied Chaol, he realized. His heart hurt for his friend, for all that Chaol had surely been realizing these past few months. “Just as you cannot pick which parts of me you accept.””He looked at his friend, perhaps for the last time, and said what he had always known, from the moment they’d met, when he’d understood that the prince was his brother in soul. “I love you.” Dorian merely nodded, eyes still blazing, and lifted his hands again towards his father. Brother. Friend. King.Sorscha & Dorian:”She usually talked like this when she was nervous. Which, Dorian had noticed with some satisfaction, was when he came near. And not in a bad way – if he’d sensed that she was truly uncomfortable, he’d have kept his distance. This was more … flustered. He liked flustered.”I suppose their relationship was doomed right from the beginning but I still would have liked it to work out. They were so sweet together, but I can’t shake the feeling that I missed some major parts of their plot. I really wish Sarah would have given us more of them because to me their entire storyline felt kinda rushed. Still, I was glad Sorscha helped Dorian to hide his magic and her being a spy was such an unexpected plot twist. >_< It really killed me when the King ordered her death and I can’t even describe how much Dorian’s pain hurt me! T_T I’m still not over this… probably I’ll never be!”Yes,” he breathed, and kissed her. It was fast – but her face was flushed, and her eyes wide as he pulled back. His own eyes were wide, gods be damned, and he was still rubbing his thumb against her soft cheek. Still contemplating going back for more, because that hadn’t been nearly enough.”Celaena & Rowan:”Why don’t you just bite me again?”“Why don’t I give you the lashing you deserve?”He looked so dead set on it that she blinked. “If you ever take a whip to me, I will skin you alive.”Oh, ho ho! Those two!! So much passion, so much pain! They were quite a sight to behold! *lol* I loved how their initial animosity turned into a solid friendship and I was so glad Celaena finally told someone about her past! This was so damn necessary and I��m glad Rowan was there to listen to her troubles and fears! <3 I’m sure they’ll become lovers in the future, but as it seems Sarah just wants to torture us a little bit more. ;-P After all she’s good at that, torture seems to be her middle name! XD Bet the J. is just a fib! Haha!”It was a selfish wish, and a fool’s hope.” She read the rest of it in his eyes. But it came true. “Dangerous, for a prince of ice and wind to pray to the Fire-Bringer,” she managed to say.Rowan shrugged, a secret smile on his face as he wiped away the tear that escaped down her cheek. “For some reason, Mala likes me, and agreed that you and I make a formidable pair.”Okay, I think I ranted enough now. *lol* So yeah, I hope I’ll get my hands on“Queen of Shadows”soon and that myprecious Gemwill continue this journey with me!

Sarah J Maas is becoming my favourite author. Her writing style is engaging, engrossing, intelligent, and easy to follow. Her imagination and storytelling are amazing. This story is a lot slower than the Crown of Midnight; it concentrates more on the character development.At the end of the last book, we learned not only who Celaena Sardothien really is but also what she really is. Her relationship with Chaol is in tatters. Having ""suggested"" to the king to send her on a mission for her own protection and cutting Prince Dorian out of the loop, Chaol is in no man’s land. Distancing himself from Dorian, for Dorian own protection, he starts to do his job and notices some irregularities with a certain high-ranking general. This forces Chaol to make some decisions of his own, how long can a good honourable man serve a tyrant like the King of Aldarlan and his many atrocities.Dorian is more alone than he has ever been, but he does manage to find solace. Finding a company is not really difficult for a handsome prince, but who can he trust. This is triply difficult as he has to not only keep his own actives, which his father will not approve of secret, his friends secrets, and most of all, his magic.We also introduced the Iron Teeth Witch Clans and especially Manon Blackbeak. Meanwhile, Celaena detours from her mission and pursues her own agenda. Meeting forgotten and powerful relatives. Before she is allowed to get the answers she wants, she must claim her heritage (her powers). She must learn to control them and master them all the while, putting he shattered life and her past. I really like the way she has to train and relearn everything. Just because you are in a stronger body does not mean you can control it, especially in a fight situation.Great story, very character driven, and impossible to put down. I kept thinking I would just read one more chapter, flicked a few pages, and thought ok I will stop at the next section break, or that\'s a short chapter might as well as finish it. Suddenly, half a quarter of the book was gone. Despite being 550+ pages, the book just flies by.

That was epic. WHERE IS BOOK #4??Read the full review atA Perfection Called Books**This review contains spoilers from previous Throne of Glass booksAs I\'m sure you all know by now, I am obsessed with the Throne of Glass series by Sarah J Maas. I was ecstatic when Bloomsbury sent me an ARC! Picking up not long after the heart-wrenching end of Crown of Midnight, Sarah J Maas dazzles and entrances readers once more with a phenomenal third book filled with magic, character growth, sacrifice, rebellion and more.“I wish you to become who you \xadwere born to be. To become queen.”Heir of Fire has most definitely made my list of best books of 2014. This book is quite different from the others in the series. I liked it a bit less than the other two, but it was so different it\'s hard to compare them. The other books center around romance and action while this book deals with the deeper stuff: betrayal, confidence, mourning, rebellion, heritage, loyalty...This book is huge. It was a bit cumbersome to hold, but the content was great! The beginning was a bit slow but eventually picked up. Everything written was absolutely necessary to carry the story though, so I didn\'t mind. The attention to detail was amazing. Everything was there for a reason, there were connections to the other books all over the place! It brought back all the feels from The Assassin\'s Blade & Crown of Midnight. Sarah J Maas is so meticulous about her writing and is truly in a league of her own. The tone of the book was much darker too. Maas has set this series on a much darker (and awesome) road than most YA series (even fantasy novels) tend to go, and I applaud her for it.The high fantasy aspect of this book was amped up. There was magic and wyverns and fae! I loved it all. This series reminds me of a YA version of Game of Thrones a bit... Less sex and deaths though. The world-building was fantastic. Everything was so clearly described. I could see it all playing out in my mind.The character development in this series is fantastic. Each of our characters has his/her own obstacles that must be overcome; they all have their own journeys.“Because I am lost,"" she whispered onto the earth. ""And I do not know the way.”We see a totally different side of Celaena in Heir of Fire. We\'re used to the cocky, confident, invincible assassin. In this book we see the vulnerable, defeated, self-loathing side of her. In the end though she comes out more fierce and determined than before, a magic-wielding queen ready to take back what\'s rightfully hers.“As for Celaena,"" he said again, ""you do not have the right to wish she were not what she is. The only thing you have a right to do is decide whether you are her enemy or her friend.”Chaol struggles to decide where his loyalties lie and how he feels about Celaena and the discoveries he made in Crown of Midnight. I\'ll admit, Chaol annoyed me so much in this book. He redeems himself in the end though. Dorian struggles to conceal his magic and stand up to his father. Both characters come so far in this book. They sacrifice so much and in the end they make the tough decisions where this is no turning back.There are quite a few new characters introduced in this book: Rowan, the fae prince and warrior who teaches Celaena how to control her magic. Aedion, the fierce general and Celaena\'s cousin. Manon, ferocious heir to the Blackbeak witch coven. All of the characters in this book are so complex and well developed. The secondary characters are just as descriptive as well. I ALMOST ship Rowan and Celaena, but I think they\'re more of a team. He\'s so fiercely devoted and smart and honest and awesome!! Aedion is so loyal and amazing. Manon is okay, she\'s a bit too blood-thirsty...With new characters come more points of view. Overall I liked the various perspectives because the plot needed all sides of the story to make sense. Sometimes though I felt that some scenes were quite unnecessary and long and dragging.We learn so many things about Erilea and what happened to Celaena ten years ago. It\'s all quite mind-blowing and a bit overwhelming. We also learn more about the King\'s nefarious actions. We see connections all over the place from the various books! Maas has been spreading the crumbs throughout the series until BAM you read Heir of Fire, and it all comes together!! The wyrdstones. The tower. The rings. The disappearances. The crumbled note. The rebels. Baba Yellowlegs. Everything happens for a reason and contributes to the story in some way.“The people you love are just weapons that will be used against you.”Romance was not a big part of this novel. There are some heartache moments for our dearest Chaolaena and a bit of romance, but there are much more important things brewing in Erilea and Wendlyn. This series is past the silly romance, it\'s moved on to the important stuff like defeating a diabolical king, bringing back magic, freeing the enslaved, and so on.As I said before, this book starts off a bit slow. Stick with it though, if you liked the other books you\'ll love this one as well. The ending is horrific yet amazing at the same time. The rebellion is forming, and we readers are kept wanting more.“He would see that world reborn, even if it took his last breath. Even if he had no name now, no position or title save Oath-Breaker, Traitor, Liar.”Heir of Fire is yet another amazing installment of the Throne of Glass series.

It was touch and go for two books, but this... this didn\'t even feel like belonging to the same series anymore. Maas has fixed almost everything I didn\'t care for in the first two books, starting with Celaena\'s character, which is literally gone, to be replaced by new and improved, and more believable Aelin Galathynius. The assassin who never assassinates, or even behaves as an assassin is no more.While we still get to enjoy the three key POVs, there are some great new characters being improved in this third book, each sharing their own perspectives. The way Maas tying two or three of them at a time (may be except for Manon) for each chapter made for a little unusual, but quite an interesting reading experience. It broke the monotony of the flow of story very well in my opinion. And Manon... A fascinating new character with her own immersive thread. I was a little confused at start, but quickly came to love that particular plotline: It was new, had a lot of mystery, and continuously eventful. And then Aedion and Rowan, who were equally interesting additions to the story, and there was never a dull moment with this trio.""It was madness and joy and terror and despair and eternity.""Now that I have finished three books, I did start to see certain similarities as well. In each book, Maas took her time in the first half, maintaining a slower pace, heavily focused on character relationships while sprinkling a little bit of magic and mystery here and there. But the second halves were always much faster, eventful, and a lot more thrilling. I was too annoyed with Celaena\'s character before to clearly notice this before, but I\'m hoping it would be consistent throughout the series.Though it didn\'t make much sense, I had still found the plot of this of series intriguing from the very first book. Heir of Fire finally explains many of those mysteries we had come across before, and appeared to be setting the direction of the series. More than once, I felt this could\'ve been a better starting point to this series. Compared to where we started, the plot was also a lot more complex with in-depth world building. With 4 more books remaining, I know it\'s too early to form an overall opinion, but, it feels like things could only get better after this. This is one of the best comebacks I\'ve came across lately.""Loyalty is earned, not given.""'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""BEAUTIFUL.

You do not have the right to wish she were not what she is.”But she learns to embrace her powers and control them. Sometimes it takes a monster to fight a monster.“Perhaps they would never get out of it, perhaps they would never be whole again, but … “Together,” she said, and took his outstretched hand.And somewhere far and deep inside her, an ember began to glow.”It's honestly been SUCH an amazing journey on how far our character has come.

Sometimes this can be a dull part of a book OR worse!! When people are suddenly masters of epic powers*grrrrr*Instead, she epically messed up... quite a lot... Aelin had to learn to control her abilities and fucked up quite a bit, to be honest“But each morning brought something new, something harder and different and miserable. Gods, he was brilliant. Cunning and wicked and brilliant.Even when he beat the hell out of her. Every. Damn. Day.”CAN'T YOU JUST PICTURE IT !She began the story asCelaena: assassin of Adarlanbetrayed by loved Chaol, manipulated by Nehemia, and scared of her own power and destiny. She ended asAelin Ashryver Galathynius“She was as much a queen as Maeve. She was the sovereign of a strong people and a mighty kingdom. She was the heir of ash and fire, and she would bow to no one.”And it all comes together with reiterating my FAVORITE quote from the first book“I will call in every favor, every debt owed to Celaena Sardothien, to my parents, to my bloodline. And then…” She looked toward the sea, toward home.“And then I am going to rattle the stars.”""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Uuuuh, girl.Empezamos a ver elevidente cambio en el universo deTrono de Cristal, una saga que comienza de forma un poco 'inocente' para lo que nos espera en sus continuaciones.Se nota hacia dónde vamos, y todo lo que ha llevado a este punto simplemente encaja, cuadra y te hace querer descubrir todo lo que Sarah tiene entre manos para con esta saga.Mucha gente odia a Celaena(¡cosa que no entiendo!),y aunque en ocasiones toma ciertas decisiones más que cuestionables, siempre sale airosa de las situaciones, porque tiene una mente estratégica y conoce perfectamente las posibles variables de sus planes. Pero sobre todo, lo que más me gusta de ella, es su psique.Es fuerte, conoce sus límites y miedos, y es capaz de controlar tantísimas emociones y guardarlas para fortalecerle que simplemente chapó.La construcción del personaje no deja de mejorar, viendo a una protagonista mucho más madura y adulta que en la primera parte de esta saga.Heredera de fuegoes diferente a los otros dos libros en muchos aspectos. No solo es mayor en cuanto a longitud de páginas, sino quepor primera vez tenemos la introducción de nuevos personajes que tienen pinta de que han venido para quedarse.Además, no todos ellos tienen una presencia dentro del ecosistema que conocíamos en Adarlan con Celaena, Chaol o Dorian, sino que los mundos fantásticos deMaas exploran otras fronteras y nuevas posibilidades, algo que agradezco, porque se denota todo el cariño y esfuerzo deworldbuildingque tiene esta saga.Para hablar de nuevos personajes... Podría tirarme horas, la verdad.Me ha encantado Rowan.DE VERDAD. Me parece una especie de Celaena, un poquito más oscuro, déspota y con menos sentimientos, pero igual de fuerte y disciplinado con un pasado traumático. El tándem que se genera entre Rowan y ella es de lo mejor del libro y no podía despegarme de las páginas en sus escenas. Luego tenemos aManon,y descubriremos por fin más sobre la magia ancestral de las brujas en este universo que nos fue introducido vagamente enCorona de medianoche. Me ha encantado ver lo diferente que ese micro-cosmos sanguinario y milenario, con la introducción de nuevas criaturas fantásticas y conflictos que estoy seguro darán mucho que hablar en las continuaciones.También tenemos a Aedion, que simplemente...cheff kiss.Quizá no tanto por él en sí, sino todo lo que le rodea, lo que genera en cuanto a temática y lo que supone para el futuro de la historia.He de admitir que me ha costado un poco terminar este libro.Lo abandoné un poquito más hacia el final, superado el ecuador, y como siempre me pasa... me arrepentí. Por mucho que me fascinara Manon como personaje, sus escenas a veces eran algo repetitivas.Lo que sucede en palacio con Dorian y Chaol era entretenido pero sentía que a veces renqueaba, avanzando demasiado lento.Pero bueno, que estoy hablando de un libro de Sarah J Maas. ¡Que en verdad no tiene relleno! Porque una vez avanzas esos obstáculos donde se definen personajes o se le dabackgrounda ciertas tramas o problemas, todo cobra sentido para desembocar en un final apoteósico.[image error]La evolución de la magia en este libro ha sido sin duda de lo mejor.Poder ver a Aelin disfrutar de todo su potencial, conocer la verdadera naturaleza de sus poderes,el inicio de lo que parece ser un ejército de zombies, los guivernos, conocer por fin el poder del rey de Adarlan... No sé, brillante que comencemos hablando de asesinatos para terminar en una guerra de poder mágico entre territorios.Heredera de fuegopuede no haberme volado la mente como los anteriores, pero consigue cementar a la saga como una de calidad superior y de personajes simplemente increíbles, y por eso se lleva mis dieces.Muero de ganas por tener en mis manos el siguiente, que saldrá a la venta en español en los próximos meses. ¡Ya os contaré!""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I had forgotten how agonizing this book is.It\'s a beautiful tale of grief, trauma, and in the end—triumph.Celaena Sardothien.Arrogant, charming, fiercely loyal. She\'s been broken. Over and over and over again. And yet she still stands strong, even in the face of suffering, agony, and emotional torture. She came to Wendlyn an empty person, devoid of all joy and peace. She left Wendlyn changed. She faced her past. She learned to accept every shattered part of her.Rowan Whitethorn.Resilient, stubborn, sardonic. He\'s all sharp edges and prickly thorns, but once Celaena gets past his rough exterior, she realizes he is hurting. Just like she is. They are kindred spirits in a lonely world.Chaol Westfall.Bitter, persistent, brave. He was left in pieces when Celaena left for Wendlyn. His friendship with Dorian is in tatters, his mental health is at a low. But he carries on. He\'s the only ordinary human in a world filled with magic, and he feels his weaknesses with every step.However, he is not right for Celaena, and we all know it. He sold her out and he refused to accept every part of her. He was an essential part of her journey, but she is a different person now.""She was not becoming anything different from what she always was and always had the capacity to be. You just finally saw everything. And once you saw that other part of her..."" Dorian said quietly. ""You cannot pick and choose which parts of her to love.""Dorian Havilliard.Devoted, intelligent, determined. He\'s insightful and sensitive, always tuned to the feelings and needs of others. He\'s accepting and kind, forgiving and generous. He accepts Celaena and still treats her like a friend, understanding that she must move on.Sorscha.Kind, gentle, courageous. I hated her the first time I read this book. But this time around, I was actually quite fond of her. She\'s a quiet, brave person. Her mild infatuation with Dorian still annoys me, but I can see now that she was absolutely essential to his recovery process. She helped Dorian when he was lonely and hurting. She made a discovery about magic that was very underwhelming, but at least she actually tried to help him.Manon Blackbeak.Cruel, cold, adamant. Violent and steadfast and so gloriouslybrutal.She\'s devoted to the Thirteen before everyone else. She\'s terrifying and beautifully deadly, but she cares deeply once you get past her mask. She\'s been manipulated and molded into the killing machine that she is now, but there is a great possibility for kindness within her, and that part of her shows whenever she\'s around Abraxos.Aedion Ashryver.Clever, loyal, haunted. He\'s hot-headed and bloodthirsty, but his mind never leaves Aelin. He\'s been living a lie ever since the massacre at Terrasen, and he\'s determined to destroy Adarlan from the inside out.These characters are beautiful.They\'re flawed, but so wonderfully vibrant.They jump off the page, almost. They have personal struggles and fears, but they\'re brave and loyal and dedicated to their cause.

The rich development of the plot and the characters, the scope of the world, the side characters, the multiple POV's... Maas truly outdid herself with this book.Celaena was just phenomenal in this instalment. Her growth was astounding and I loved how this started off with her almost breaking down with grief and depression and intense self-hatred and shame. Sarah J Maas has a knack for really diving into broken characters, and as the story progressed and we found out more about Celaena’s past, I felt the weight of her sadness and responsibility with her. It was heartbreaking to read.One of the main things I’ve noticed whilst rereading the series this time round is how parallel and connected each plot and each character is to one another. There’s something about that that I just love, because it not just about Celaena trying to reclaim who she is, but about how each characters struggle and success adds to the bigger picture of it all, of this world they are wanting to rebuild and the peace they’re trying to regain.Every character and their journey is adding something to the story, the overall, bigger picture.

Not only forCelaena Sardothienbut also for all of her companions and enemies.Heavy with grief,Celaenais sent on a mission byAdarlan\'s King, with the purpose of assassinating the King and Crown Prince of Wendlyn.UnlikeErilea, magic roams freely inWendlyn, a Kingdom ruled byHouse Ashryver. Located nearby isDoranellealso known asthe City of Rivers, a Fae city ruled by its Fae QueenMaeve, one of the threeFae Sister-Queens. For ages, humans, Fae and demi-Fae dwell peacefully in that land.By arriving atVarese, Wendlyn\'s Capital City and meetingRowan Whitethorn, a Fae warrior serving underQueen Maeve, Celaena must face her heritage and learn to wield the dormant magic that has been coursing through her blood from birth in exchange for the valuable knowledge Queen Maeve holds that could save her friends and Erilea.Celaena is taken toMistward, the fortress and home to the demi-Fae, and there she will train with Rowan until she masters her powers and gets the answers she\'s seeking from Queen Maeve about the Wyrdkeys.What I love mostly aboutHeir of FireisCelaena\'shealing journey and experiencing the magnitude of her grief and despair especially after the events ofCrown of Midnight. It made me wonder to what point will Celaena break to regain herself? Will she be forever haunted by the shadow of all her beloved dead?

Theworld-building and the settingwas lushly atmospheric and rich in details.Theaction-sequencesfired me up and had me on the edge of my seat.Heir of Fireintroduced us to three new characters that have joined the main cast:• Rowan Whitethorn: A Fae Prince and one of the six elite warriors serving under Queen Maeve.• Aedion Ashryver: A General in Adarlan\'s army and cousin toAelin Ashryver Galathynius, the lost heir ofTerrasen.• Manon Blackbeak: An Ironteeth Witch and Heir of the Blackbeak Witch ClanThe book is divided intomultiple POVSof: Celaena, Chaol, Dorian, Manon and Rowan.Each character gets theproper developmentneeded to push the story further which shaped the events of what is yet to come in the future.InCelaena\'schapters, I loved seeing the development between her and Rowan; feeling the intense tension between them, then seeing that dislike mellowing and turning into admiration and then witnessing that growing friendship between them turn into something much more precious, a bond sealed by the words""To Whatever End"".ThroughManon Blackbeak\'schapters, we are introduced to theWitch-clansofThe Waste. There are three main Ironteeth Witch clans:The Blackbeaks, The Yellowlegs and The Bluebloods. The Ironteeth Witches are offered to chooseWyvernsto fly into battle and become part ofKing Adarlan\'snew Aerial Legion. Manon chooses a bait wyvern and names himAbraxos, after the ancient serpent who held the world between his coils at the behest of the Three-Faced Goddess..Chaol and Dorian\'schapters give insight to the events occurring inAdarlanand the secrets that are uncovered especially the ones concerning Aelin. Dorian begins to learn more of his magic while Chaol must do what needs to be done in order to protect Dorian and his Kingdom. Also, a new romance sparks for Dorian with his healerSorchawho helped attend to his, Chaol and Celaena\'s wounds for months.I also loved thesecondary charactersthat were present in the book:Emrys, Luca, Malakai, Asterin and the brief appearance of Rowan\'s Cadre.To me,Heir of Firewas a healing book and an adventure that took me to different places at the same time. I felt the consuming rush of adrenaline through most of it, I felt the hollowness of the scenes that dealt with grief, and heart fluttered and tingled during the heartwarming scenes.I think all this points out to why I love this book the most out of all the other 7 books in the series.

And I think... I might have liked it?Here's what worked for me:- major character development for Celaena, we finally get glimpses of actual emotion & not bullshit facade... I didn't want to punch her THAT much- Dorian is getting a personality!!!- Aedion, man of my dreams- MANON YOU ARE THE BITCH WITCH OF MY HEART- the plot was PLOT, like it actually moved and had depth and shit???- and of course... ROWANRowan, you sweet tortured baby, you deserve your own paragraph. IlovedRowan and I especially loved how he treated Celaena. Frankly, she kind of deserved to be treated like shit for a little bit. I liked that he was standoffish and that he has some backstory of his own. Inevitably, I compared him to Rhysand in my mind and that initially made Rowan fall kind of flat... but once I pushed that away I REALLY appreciated this sweet boi for what he is. Which is: perfect for Celaena.And I think that's really where Maas succeeds. She creates beautifully flawed (and yes sometimes annoying) characters that interact SO WELL with each other. I live for the ships in her books because flaws are complemented, strong suits are contrasted, and in general I wait with bated breath for the characters to get it on. So clearly she's doing something right.This was great & I'm VERY excited for the rest of the series.Also I didn't forget Chaol, I just hate him.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3 - 3.5 StarsMaybe I will review this later, maybe I won’t...Regardless. The most important thing you need to know about my totally non important thoughts on this book is this:Helloooooooo Rowan.Hubba hubba.Other than that, some parts moved like a ship through mud; but in the end, I really loved seeing our protagonist come into her own here.

Yours Truly (Part of Your World, #2)
",Abby Jimenez,4.31,532994,292573,"Romance, Fiction, Audiobook, Contemporary, Contemporary Romance, Adult, Chick Lit",416,11-04-2023,"A novel of terrible first impressions, hilarious second chances, and the joy in finding your perfect match.Dr. Briana Ortiz’s life is seriously flatlining. Her divorce is just about finalized, her brother’s running out of time to find a kidney donor, and that promotion she wants? Oh, that’s probably going to the new man-doctor who’s already registering eighty-friggin’-seven on Briana’s “pain in my ass” scale. But just when all systems are set to hate, Dr. Jacob Maddox completely flips the game . . . by sending Briana a letter.And it’s a really good letter. Like the kind that proves that Jacob isn’t actually Satan. Worse, he might be this fantastically funny and subversively likeable guy who’s terrible at first impressions. Because suddenly he and Bri are exchanging letters, sharing lunch dates in her “sob closet,” and discussing the merits of freakishly tiny horses. But when Jacob decides to give Briana the best gift imaginable—a kidney for her brother—she wonders just how she can resist this quietly sexy new doctor . . . especially when he calls in a favor shecan’trefuse.","[{'rating': 3, 'content': '3 ⭐️ Loved the first half, but the second half lost me""I\'m broken."" The hopeless way she said it made tears pinch from my eyes.""We\'re all a little broken, Briana. We are a mosaic. We\'re made up of all those we\'ve met and all the things we\'ve been through. there are parts of us that are colorful and dark and jagged and beautiful. And I love every piece of you. Even the ones you wish didn\'t exist.""WHAT TO EXPECT:✨ fake dating romance✨ co-workers / doctors✨ anxious, cinnamon roll hero✨ depressed, kind heroine✨ both are recovering from a recent breakup/divorce✨ exchanging letters✨ miscommunication✨ so much angst✨ dual POV✨topics addressed: anxiety, depression, infidelity (cheating ex), divorce, miscarriage, family member with kidney failureThis review is hard for me to write because the things I loved about the story make me want to give it a higher rating. But the things I disliked are what\'s making me leave it as is. I was full-on in love with this story for probably the first 50% to the point I was sure I\'d be giving it 5-stars. But around the 50% and onward mark, I noticed things I didn\'t quite like.What I liked:Jacob.I loved everything about this man. He\'s so sweet, understanding, considerate, and caring. He\'s also incredibly self-aware and manages his anxiety in a healthy way. Jacob isn\'t perfect, but he tries his best to be. If he does something wrong, he\'ll try to fix it. If he\'s hurt someone, he\'ll apologize. He\'s so selfless he even donates his kidney to a stranger! He\'s also got a beautiful home, a sunroom filled with plants, and a three-legged dog! Where do they make men like him??? Jacob is one of the most loveable male characters I\'ve ever come across while reading, and I want him to be happy in this fictional world. 💕Brianna.What a firecracker! She is smart, fierce, fun, loyal, and kind. But she also has a secret crazy side where if you mess with her or the people she loves, she\'ll come for you! She cares so much for those around her (like Benny), even at her own expense. I absolutely adored Bri and laughed so hard when we found out exactly how she responded to her cheating husband.The letter exchanges at the beginning were so adorable!It\'s not something I\'ve seen done very often in books, but it\'s such an interesting way for the characters to open up and be vulnerable with one another in a short amount of time. While Bri\'s letters tended to be more fun and entertaining, Jacob\'s letters were reflective and sincere. The exchanges were a sweet way for the characters to get to know one another while establishing trust.Bri and Jacob\'s romance.The love these two have is the soulmate kind. They were drawn to each other and perfectly fit in a way most people can only dream of. There was so much respect, understanding, patience, love, and passion way before things even progressed physically, so you know what they have is the real deal. I really enjoyed watching them grow together and help each other work through their own issues.The depth of this story.I was expecting more of a fun, sexy vibe like inPart Of Your World, and while this did have light-hearted, entertaining moments, it was a lot more serious and dealt with some heavy topics. Anxiety is the main focus since Jacob struggles with this, and I think Abby Jimenez did a great job showcasing what it\'s like to have anxiety and the challenges of managing it. The book also talks about depression, infidelity, divorce, miscarriage, and a family member with kidney failure. None of these topics are easy to discuss, but I think Abby Jimenez did a fairly decent job with them. I do think there may have been so much going on that certain topics were overlooked and quickly wrapped up in the end, but it did work with the story.What I didn\'t like:How Jacob\'s anxiety somehow isn\'t as present once he starts spending time with Bri.As someone who struggles with anxiety, it is true that there are some people who can help calm the anxiety. However, the fact Jacob claims to basically have little to no anxiety around Bri (at least when he\'s not stressing about liking her) is so ridiculous and far-fetched. I think it feeds into the unhealthy belief that being with someone can \'fix your problems\'.There are too many tropes.You\'ve got workplace romance, rivals to lovers, recovering from a breakup, fake dating, stuck together, one-bed, MISCOMMUNICATION, soul mates and I can\'t even say the last one without spoiling something major. But as you can see, there are quite a few. And while they all worked together, it just made the story unnecessarily complicated.The slow-burn romance was soooooo slow and was sprinkled with so much MISCOMMUNICATION that it caused too much unnecessary angst.Throughout the story, Brianna and Jacob do things for each other that are obviously actions of love, and both have inner monologues about how they are falling in love with the other, but because of miscommunication, they can\'t fathom the other person could reciprocate their feelings. These two were a ticking time bomb that finally exploded at the 85% mark when they FINALLY showed romantic feelings for each other by having sex. But soon after, Brianna withdraws, and the angst resumes. While I love their love for one another, watching their relationship evolve was not an enjoyable experience.PS: There\'s one sex scene, and it\'s very abrupt. After making us wait so long for them to get together, I wanted this moment to be drawn out, but it wasn\'t. So if you are looking for a spicy read, this ain\'t it.The inner monologues became incredibly repetitive.I noticed this a little inPart OF Your Worldand I\'d found myself skimming a few sentences. But this happened so frequently inYours Truly, that I skimmed paragraphs. There were a lot of deep thoughts, which are obviously important, but it felt like the characters were beating a dead horse by talking about the same things over and over again.No matter what, Amy is and will always be an unlikeable character.From how she\'s described, she seems to have narcissistic tendencies and needs to learn empathy. At first, we\'re supposed to dislike Amy and who wouldn\'t? From how Jacob describes her (based on how she treated him during their relationship), she is self-centered, selfish, and unaware of how her actions affect others. But halfway through the story, the author tries to shift our perspective of her and justify why she left Jacob and ended up dating his brother. Look, I don\'t really enjoy stories where the ex ends up dating the main character\'s friend or sibling. It just creates drama that makes me feel extremely icky. But she treated Jacob so poorly and never really apologized for how she overlooked his anxiety during the relationship or for dating his brother 3 months after the breakup. I just can\'t forgive that. Even Jacob tells Bri that Amy is a \'my way or the highway\' type of person while his brother is so \'go with the flow\' that they will be a good match. I just . . . no. Amy is inconsiderate of others and is in no way ready to be in a relationship - even if his brother is fine with a partner who will walk all over him. By the end of the book, we\'re supposed to understand and accept Amy but I just couldn\'t.Thank you, NetGalley for the ARC in exchange for an honest review. As always, all opinions are my own.'}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""Bri's book!!!

I loved the characters in this book so so much. They're both doctors which is fun! And both have their own tough relationship histories - Briana is going through a divorce & Jacob's ex is marrying his brother😳. Also Jacob is SO SO sweet. Sweetest most wholesome book boyfriend I've ever read about. Jacob also has anxiety and I thought Abby Jiminez wrote about his anxiety in a very realistic way which I enjoyed reading about.The only thing stopping this from being a 5-star read is that the conflict was quite frustrating for me for a good chunk of the book. It's a very miscommunication, both characters make assumptions kind of conflict that could've been solved with better communication. However, I do think the conflict fit the characters & their backstories. So I felt very mixed on that plot point.Overall, Abby Jimenez is such a beautiful writer & I'm excited to read Just For The Summer by her!""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Abby Jimenez books like chicken soup for soul with a little extra spice that refers the angsty parts! They actually have healing powers, embracing both of your heart and soul and whispering your ear; “ everything is gonna be okay”As soon as I read the plot about two broken hearted souls’ second chances story that started with enemies to lovers trope mixes with fake dating, I knew I would love this book so much!Part of your world’s Alexis’ best friend ER doctor Brianna Ortiz finally got her own book.Brianna is dealing with the shittiest year of hers: her baby brother suffers from autoimmune disease and he urgently needs a kidney transplant. Their father who left them 3 decades ago rejects to help him. None of the family members are the ideal match!Poor Brianna also finalized her divorce with her cheating husband she’s spent 10 years of her life. The worst part is he’s having a longtime relationship with one of her best friends behind his back!Speaking about the a.holes ; new charming ER doctor Jacob Maddox who also has another worst kind of relationship experience. His self absorbed, extra energetic girlfriend starts dating with his brother after only three months passed from their breakup! Oh this is not the worst part: she also said yes to marry with him!Jacob already deals with anxiety issues and he is forced to work this new hospital to stay away from her ex ( ironically she’s going to be part of his family so there’s no way to get rid of her. They’re stuck with each other forever)The first day at job is truly disastrous for Jacob: he loses 7 patients in one day, earning the grudge of nurses who find him socially awkward. They called him “ Doctor Death” even though he doesn’t have any resemblance with Joshua Jackson!And a few days later he accidentally achieves to alienate Brianna by making an abrupt comment about her brother’s condition.Because of his anxiety issues he has hard time to express his true feelings so he decides to pour his feelings into writing, leaving a letter to Brianna.As soon as Brianna reads it, she realizes she wasn’t fair with him so they continue to write letters for each other and a genuine friendship starts blooming around them.When Brianna finds out her brother has an anonymous donor for transplant, she cannot be happier! She accidentally finds out the donor is Jacob! She feels extra ashamed to treat him so rude in the beginning of the relationship and for compensation of her mistreat she accepts to fake date him throughout the family gatherings till his ex and his brother’s wedding.But as they start to spend more time and know each other, both of them realize they cannot fake anymore. But the emotional baggages they have been carrying may be the biggest obstacles against their happily ever after!I was so close to give five stars to this book! I loved Jacob, her eccentric family, her nosy sisters and his cigarette addict grandfather a lot!But Brianna made me so pissed off. It was understandable that she had trust issues but she just kept thinking worst of Jacob and compare him with her ex! She took her entire frustration out on him. And this was extremely unfair for sweet Jacob who made so many sacrifices for her! He was so adorable, sweetest human being.So I cut one star because of extra annoying heroine and giving my four sweet- swoon- angsty-tear jerker- lighthearted stars!Many thanks to NetGalley and Forever( Grand Central Publishing) for sharing this amazing digital reviewer copy with me in exchange my honest opinions.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'at any given time, i feel like i\'m reading romance as a cry for help.when i find a romance novel i love, it\'s my favorite kind of genre to enjoy. just so comforting and fun and feelings-y.but the vast, vast majority of the time, i am way too picky to bear it.and in this case, well...this book is just bad.sorry.i really wanted to like this book, insistent product placement of the author\'s weird side quest cupcake wars-appearing bakery and all.but it was too quirky and too much for me. there were CLIFFHANGERS in this book. like, chapters that ended with ellipses. ""until he saw who was in the room..."" and ""she wasn\'t ready for what happened next...""-ass sentences. it feels silly.this was unfortunately a not-good book on a sentence level (lots of weirdly constructed ones), on a plot level (clichéd confessions, an undue level of love interest-on-love interest obsession), or on a character level (we have a quirky gal and a boring guy, much like every romance of the last 5 years seems doomed to contain).on top of that, this was arduous to get through. we\'re talking 320+ pages of miscommunication followed by 10 pages of happiness followed by, you guessed it, MORE miscommunication.and for two people who tell each other 1100 times they\'ll be harmless (maybe ""be harmless to each other"" can be our always), they never tried to talk at all.sheesh.bottom line: i don\'t know what i did in a past life to deserve it, but this was a punishing read.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'This was kind of precious.

Even the ones you wish didn’t exist.”After the success that part of your world was (for me) I thought that this would be an amazing read as well, especially with the way it was shaping out to be. the first half was so strong and so sweet and cute. It was honestly looking like it was gonna be a five star read, sure it was slow at the start but i I was having a good time with this one but then came the second half and it frustrated the fuck outta me. I would still say that this was a fun read and not at all bad- it just could\'ve been so much more than it was. One thing for certain is that Abby Jimenez is actually very talented and has the ability to write the best summery rom-coms and I will read her grocery list if I have to.Jacob was easily the highlight of the story! He actually saved this book. This man was a walking, talking green flag and one so adorable. I actually saw so much of myself in him- well....he was a lot more selfless than I could ever be but I related to his reactions to social anxiety and the way he dealt with them because reading his arc felt so real, I go through the stages that he goes through and I loved the way it was depicted because I could see myself through it and I loved it! it was like I was screaming at the book ""SEE?!?"" because everything that Jacob did felt so relatable. I feel like Jimenez did everything for his character and made it feel so perfectly done. I loved how he did not shy away from confessing his feeling to us in his point of views and the effort that he put in for Bri spoke louder than anything. Jacob was truly the star of this book.Bri\'s part was where Abby messed up. I felt particularly nothing towards her- I feel like her trauma and past wasn\'t explored more and she wasn\'t given the dept Jacob was given which made her actions rather more erratic. I did understand why she had trust issues but I did not feel that strongly for her despite her heavy losses because they barely get talked about in the book. One thing that I absolutely hated about her was her constant need to assume everything which messed everything up and caused so much miscommunication, both of them struggled to express their feeling but when Jacob actually asked her out, she denied and assumed that he was seeing her as a booty call and I was like yk that man for 6 months, you work with him everyday, he donated his fucking KIDNEY for your brother and hid it to avoid any recognition and you still assumed that?? the back forth that bri caused was not fun to read and when it got all resolved Bri (Jimenez) slaps us with a third act and I was furious.The romance was cute, I enjoyed it a lot. The letter and the fake dating + the kind gestures and all the domestic moments, it was so fun to read but I feel like the miscommunication was done for the sake of more angst and tension and it failed miserably there :(All in all, I had my share of enjoyable and frustrating moments!___""Jimenez is a true talent""is what Emily Henry said and she\'s not the one to lie 🤭 + the first book was amazing!•Buddy reading with the one and onlyRoxy'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Jacob is a stunningly amazing protagonist.first half of this story rocked my world 10/10 amazing no notes. the letters were phenomenal, their banter made me smile, the representation of jacob’s anxiety and briana’s sweetness toward him brought a tear to my eye and everything was perfect until we got into cyclical internal monologuing for hundreds of pages “there’s no way she likes me it’s fake” “there’s no way he likes me it’s a rebound”. then the miscommunication dragged…and then a new conflict was introduced/new parts of a tragic backstory were unlocked with only 40 pages left in the novel. the pacing was severely off, and things got repetitive, but the characters were lovable and it was compulsively readable with many heartwarming moments so I’d read another from the author in the future.

I wanted to shake and punch some characters, and hug, kiss and love some others. It was such a roller coaster of emotions of all kinds.➴ I could say so many things about this book and how much I loved it, but besties, I would never finish. So, this review will be a messy one, but done with love💗 haha➴ I absolutely LOVED Briana and Jacob. They are the sweetest and most supportive couple ever. The way they understood each other, even without words- just knowing and understanding each other was so beautiful❤️\u200d the fact that Briana could understand what was going on in Jacob’s mind and how much he struggled with anxiety was so pure and gorgeous. She never pushed him, and she always looked for ways to make him feel comfortable and safe. She wanted to include him in her plans just because she couldn’t have enough of him, and vice versa. And Jacob? this man isperfect.I know I say this with every mmc I read in a new book, but seriously,HE IS PERFECT.He would do anything just to talk to her and be with her. Like- he spent 3 hours in the rain and was bitten by mosquitoes just to be able to talk to her on a call. Like- what!? Anyway, I love them.➴ listen- I’m not a fan at all of the miscommunication trope, but I forgive it in this book. Was it frustrating and sometimes I wanted to shake them? YES, but I completely understood their situations. Struggling with social anxiety and depression, and all the terms that come with them is not easy. All the rumination, insecurities, ""what ifs"", negative thoughts/feelings/emotions, etc., can mess up badly with our behavior and prevent us from doing what we really want to do/say. It\'s easy to be a spectator and think “why don\'t they just say what they really feel or think?”, but it’s so hard for that person to actually do it. It’s not like the person doesn’t want to do it/ say it. It\'s just that they can\'t no matter how much they want to. Those negative thoughts win the battle most of the time, so yeah. This played a big role in the miscommunication between Briana and Jacob.➴ I felt so identified with this book, especially with Jacob. I haven\'t dealt with depression, but I can speak from personal experience about social anxiety, and let me tell you this- it isAWFUL.The constant rumination and overthinking, the fear and excessive anxiety. The shame you feel by just talking to someone, or just trying/wanting to talk to someone but you don\'t do it for fear of rejection or embarrassment. The discomfort of being surrounded and not feeling safe or wanted, or the feeling of being watched and judged. I’ve always struggled with social anxiety. It made it so hard to make friends while growing up because I just wanted to be alone and avoid social interactions. And those social interactions are SO HARD. Like, you can see me with a “bitch face”, but in my mind, I’m just wondering how I would act or what I would say if someone talked to me, or if I would panic and go completely blank. I’m nice, seriously🤣 but the struggle is REAL. It wasand still isso exhausting to just handle a conversation. I’m the type of person who prefers texts over calls so in that way I can thinkoverthinkwhat I can say without embarrassing myself. I hate spontaneous things, just like Jacob. Also, I need to write down the food I’m ordering so I can say it correctly when I call the food place (trust me, it’s necessary. It happened to me once that I LITERALLY ordered the NAME OF THE PLACE instead of the food I wanted🤡🤣 so, of course I hung up, almost died of embarrassment and laughter, and made my mom order the food LMAO). Another case was that I even dropped out of one college class because the final evaluation was an oral presentation at a convention- an immediate NOPE on my part. In another class, I did not make the final oral presentation and wrote to the teacher that I was okay with getting a lower grade for it. Same as our baby Jacob, I NEED to know the menu before getting to a restaurant because otherwise, it would take me years to decide what to order. I prefer to spend all my time at home reading books than going out. Anddd it is soooo difficult to express my feelings and thoughts. Like, I can work perfectly with other people\'s feelings and emotions, but mine? Bye.➴ social anxiety has stopped me from doing so many things. I’m working on it and will probably continue working on it for many years to come. So yeah, I absolutely loved Jacob and his representation of the struggle with social anxiety because it’s completely accurate. I loved that he went to therapy and had coping skills, like journaling✨ the letters he sent to Bri and vice versa💌🤌🏼❤️\u200d🩹 the way Briana understood him🦋🦋 the way they work together to support each other with their struggles🛐🦋🛐🦋➴ I don’t know what else to say!

The audio version was so good too!I related to Briana so much - got some Grey’s Anatomy vibes with the hospital romance plot. I absolutely loved this book.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4 Stars ☆""The truest sacrifices are the ones no one knows anything about.”I wasn\'t sure what mood I was in, but this one hit the spot. It\'s safe to say that now Abby Jimenez will be an auto buy author for me from now on. There was really only one thing that I didn\'t like about this that had me making the decision of dropping down a star. I will explain later.Yours Truly is the second book in the Part of Your World series. That has many alluring tropes that include fake dating, friends to lovers, workplace romance, and the dreaded miscommunication that is filled with tension, banter, lots of laugh out loud moments and some tears. There are some heavy real-life topics, and Abby just has a way of describing mental health issues to make it seem real and depicted in the best of ways.Briana Ortiz\'s life seems to be in shambles these days. Her divorce is about to be finalized, her brother is in desperate need of a kidney as his life is fading away before her eyes and to top it off the promotion she wants may go to the new doctor, Jacob Maddox. The thing is, he has no intention of running for the promotion and started to work at Royamue to escape the awkwardness of working with his brother and ex-girlfriend, who had just announced they are getting married. Not knowing why he transferred Briana gives him a tough time until he writes her an apology letter. They begin writing little notes to one another, and from there, a friendship is built. Their friendship takes a turn when Brianna discovers that Jacob volunteered to donate a kidney to her brother and to repay him she agrees to be his fake girlfriend up until his brother and exes wedding.Jacob Maddoxis just so precious and needs to be protected at all costs. He is the sweetest, most caring, selfless, understanding, and strong cinnamon roll man. Aside from all of that, he does struggle with social anxiety and has it handled mostly by managing it in a healthy way. When he feels it becoming high, he journals to calm it down. This man had me feeling all sorts of things for him. I fell in love with him, and to top it off, he has a three-legged dog that be rescued Leuteniant Dan. Oh, my heart.""I will however accept your invitation to be invited and never come. That sounds like an excellent time. I also enjoy not answering calls, not networking, never leaving the house, and hanging out with my dog.""Brianna Ortizis smart, strong, fierce, and protective if the ones she cares about are a bit broken with trust issues. Every man that has ever entered her life has done her wrong and left, beginning with her farther. We see her struggle with the depression of going through a divorce of after ten years by a man who cheated on her with her friend. She does get the sweetest revenge, and I was here for it. She waters her house plants with bleach and sprinkled glitter throughout their house. She was so hilarious and had me laughing so hard, I really did love her. Somethings did annoy me with her, but in the end, you can\'t really blame her with all she\'s been through. It made me so happy to see her growth develop even if it happened at the end.""Okay, so Dad left. But this one won’t. I picked right, not all men are like Dad. This one’s going to carry me. All my broken pieces.""Jacob and Briannathey had chimsry that was palpable once they got past, not really liking one another. My only issue is that even though the chemistry was there, the miscommunication drug on too much for me. I knew that it would be present, but it could have been wrapped up sooner, in my opinion. Outside of that, though, they were each others perfect match. They have a type of quiet love. She gets his different silences and what they mean. They can be completely silent together and understand one another other. I loved that about them because I feel like it\'s hard to come by.“Love shows up. That’s how you know when it’s real.""I loved most of the side characters and fell even more in love with Jacob\'s family. The way that they inserted themselves into his life, always making sure that he was alright and always showed up, had me cracking up every time. I was happy to see Benny Briannas brother getting his happiness and am hoping that he gets a book with Jacob\'s sister. Last but not least, I loved the appearances we got of Alexis and Daniel.I adored the ending so much. The tears were flowing the last 10%, and the words were blurred reading the last letter Jacob wrote to Brianna. I had to reread it a couple of times. All in all, I did enjoy this and can\'t wait to read more works from Abby.Favorite quotes and moments“This is one of the best days of my life, on one of the worst days of my life. And all I’m going to remember when I think about it is you and what you’ve done. Thank you so much.”“I always think that when we’re quiet, we’re agreeing to be harmless to each other. That we’re just sharing the same space and letting each other exist exactly as we are, and neither of us would hurt or upset the other one.”“This is what it feels like to be truly loved. I’ve never felt it before. And I didn’t even realize it until just now.” He smiled at me gently. “Yes. This is what it feels like.”“We’re all a little broken, Briana. We are a mosaic. We’re made up of all those we’ve met and all the things we’ve been through. There are parts of us that are colorful and dark and jagged and beautiful. And I love every piece of you. Even the ones you wish didn’t exist.”“I’m trying to manifest the things I want by speaking them into the universe.” “And you want a wife?” “Only if it’s you.”~~~~~~Pre-review:I\'m not sure what I feel like right now. Mood reader struggles. Let\'s see if this is 🤞🤸\u200d♀️'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I. love. you. Jacob. This book was simple perfect in every way !'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Colour me confused and conflicted. 😖Part of Your World was better.Disclaimer:I was reading this book with an anxious frame of mind. Anxiety and I were spending a ghastly amount of time together.I might possibly have been triggered, though that’s not something I ever experience when it comes to books. There’s always a first for something…The characters were spiralling and seeing their thoughts on page… I couldn’t necessarily separate my mind from it.At the same time, I didn’t want to put this book down either. It had so many good qualities.It might be the book, but it could very well be me. So take that rating with a grain of salt.It’s me, I’m the problem.The miscommunication trope is not a trope that usually bothers me.There’s something that’s innately human about the fact that most people don’t want to let others know how they are feeling.Talking about your feelings sucks. Occasionally overrated. And being vulnerable and open with someone? Well, fuck that behaviour all together. Who has the emotional capacity for that all the time? Or even half the time?Just let me overthink and leave me alone. In peace.So because I understand that talking and telling someone about your feelings and what you’re going through isn’t what its always cracked up to be,I’m more lenient when this trope is introduced within a story. I have more patience for it. I empathise massively.It doesn’t usually bring the story down for me. Except maybe in this case… though there were other factors.It does depend on how the author explores that aspect and whether I can understand if from the character’s point of view. I guess this is subjective for everyone.And even when you do understand it sometimes, you still want to beat the characters over their heads. “Just fuckin’ talk, will ya?”“Would I express myself if I was in their situation? Maybe. Maybe not.”You have these conversations with yourself.Now, for context, these two characters are fake-dating.Miscommunication is bound to show up. You made a deal to fake your feelings and by the end, you’re unsure whether those fake feelings are real or not. Whether they are reciprocated or not.Cue the anxiety. 😵\u200d💫Jacob’s brand of anxiety is exactly like mine. Scarily fuckin’ accurate.Briana has a warped perception of men and relationships because she was in a bad one. Her dad leaving when young hasn’t helped that situation, neither does her mother who just spews a toxic narrative about men. This is what she’s grown up hearing and it still continued.Almost the whole story is them battling their feelings. It occasionally read angsty but I also wanted to shout at these characters. It felt drawn out by the author. And I don’t know whether that was needed.Not only was the miscommunication drawn out, things really fuckin’ exploded towards the end.I despise it when authors save all of the conflict(s) till the last minute.There wasn’t enough of a buildup for it. For the characters or the readers. It was such a surprise and not in a good way. It read messy.The readers know Briana suffered through a disgusting marriage. We know that from the slight things that are mentioned.She felt so unbelievably bleak about life that I wish we had walked through some of those parts with her, to really connect with her.I wish we had more vulnerable conversations between her and Jacob, where they explored those wounds, because they already had the foundation of a great friendship.I wish the characters would stop thinking for the other person, to make an assumption and run with it like it’s final. Like its fact. I mean, we are all guilty of this. We know it comes from fear of rejection. It’s an aggravating human characteristic.I wish, I wish, I wish. The last thing I want to be doing whilst reading a book is rewriting the story in my head.😓This just turned into a fuckin’ essay. 😬I understand some of the elements the author chose. But I wasn’t satisfied with it.I appreciated massively how Abby Jimenez showcased Jacob’s anxiety. I adored his family. He was the sweetest of characters. Briana was beautiful and fiery and such a light. Loyal and the type that goes to the ends of the earth for someone she cares about. Their banter was amazing and the way they connected was adorable.It’s not that it was a bad book. It really wasn’t. It just wasn’t my book.*Please check out the author’s ‘review’ on GR for trigger warnings.*'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '★★★★★ - 6 starsi’m so obsessed and in love with this book that no thoughts can express how i feel. it was so unexpectedly beautiful. i made sure to give myself some time to calm down (one night) because if i tried to form any thoughts after finishing, it would be impossible.where do i start?? at first, this book seems like a cute, heartfelt little romance—and it is—but it also SO much more. it’s a story of overcoming past trauma, finding your person, and discovering hope. i laughed, i cried, and literally felt my heart bursting with emotion. i’m in awe of how well Abby is able to elicit these feelings in me. that’s when i knew it was a 5 star.this book starts out with my favorite character of the series, Briana Ortiz—or Bri. she’s absolutely hilarious and so caring. the way she helped Alexis in the last book made my adoration for her grow even more. and to read a book from her own perspective, i learned a ton about the person she is. i can’t even explain how much i love her.in the beginning of this book, she was juggling a lot of heartbreak. first, she was finalizing a divorce, and second, her little brother’s kidneys are failing. when all seems hopeless, her only goal is to find a donor for her brother, but time is running out. she begins to give up and realize just how tragic her life has become. that’s when she meets Jacob. her first impression of him is not the best. things quickly changed when he sends her a letter.and when i saw the letters being sent back and forth, i knew i would love this book. there’s such a deep understanding that is achieved with sending handwritten letters. i’ve only read about this trope a few times, and it’s never failed to make me obsessed. i could feel Jacob and Bri’s connection growing stronger with each letter.i’m so happy for Bri and the trauma she was able to overcome. she found Jacob, and Jacob found her. they are simply better together. she’s such a strong and kind woman. the things she went through, she didn’t deserve, but she deserves all the happiness that came afterward.Jacob made me feel safe. He was like a living lullaby. A softly spoken word. The smell of coffee and toast in the morning or a cozy fleece blankets. The rain pattering on the roof on a day where you don’t have to go anywhere or do anything.Jacob was the sweetest man to ever exist. i know i said Daniel was perfect, but Jacob isPERFECT.his experience with anxiety was written so well. i could feel his thoughts through the pages. i hate that he never felt validated before Bri, because he deserves it more than anything. anxiety is real. and it’s okay to let yourself feel it. there are no proper words to express how much i love Jacob. none. if i could show you what he’s done to my heart, i would. thinking about his love for Bri brings actual tears to my eyes. i am so happy he’s found his person. someone who calms him but also lets him express his emotions. Jacob is among the top romance men for simply being a raw, genuine human being. every single thing he did for Bri was adorable and i enjoyed every moment with them.I couldn’t explain the lift I felt in my chest. For the first time in weeks, the electric hum of my anxiety softened. I could breathe again.Briana made me the best version of myself when I was with her somehow.I needed my life calm, easy, and static. but I wouldn’t do that with Briana. I’d leave my comfort zone. I had to. Because that’s where she was. And for her I would go anywhere.Jacob seriously has so many amazing qualities that make him the sweetest human being to ever exist. from his love of animals, to relationship with his family, to his plants, his silly socks, his kind actions, his affirmations, every single thing about him is perfect. i know i keep saying it, but i mean it.and when Jacob gave Bri his journal to prove to her how much he loves her, that was it. there is truly no man as wonderful as him. the fact that Jacob was willing to give his all and strip himself down completely, especially not knowing whether the other feels the same, is everything. he might not have been sure of how Bri felt, but he knew exactly how he did. Jacob did every possible thing to he deserving of her love and was still prepared to do more. there is nothing that could make me admire him more. Jacob is the standard.It was a love story.Ourlove story.He let me look into his soul. And the only thing in there wasus.“I willneverleave you, Briana. Do you hear me?Never.Every single thing that matters to me in this world is in this bed. I love you.”“We’re all a little broken, Briana. We are a mosaic. We’re made up of all those we’ve met and all the things we’ve been through. There are parts of us that are colorful and dark and jagged and beautiful. And I love every piece of you. Even the ones you wish didn’t exist.”“You know, love shows up, Briana. And even if you keep me away from you, my heart will still be where you are. So just let me be where you are.”their romance developed at the perfect pace. not too fast, but also not too slow. they shared so many tender and honest moments. i knew from the start that they’d have a healthy relationship. their love for each other is literally the meaning of “the light at the end of a tunnel.” this is a book about two people who believe they don’t deserve love when truly, they deserve all the love in the world.Alexis looked up at me from her seat. “Bri? When he tells you he loves you, believe it. Be brave and believe it.”now, i was fully ready for the book to wrap up with a nice happy ending when Jacob and Bri were at the wedding. but ladies and gentlemen, meet Abby Jimenez. if you think you’re getting a romance book, you’re getting SO much more than that. i know the miscommunication bothers a lot of people, and it did made me want to rip my hair out, but i also think it was worth it by the end. maybe it would have been nice for them to communicate a bit sooner, but good things take time. this book showed me just how much past trauma can affect a relationship. i went from all giddy to absolutely shattered and covered in tears. i don’t know how to accurately describe that in words. books don’t usually have that effect on me. movies, yes. books? eh. the way i cried at the end of this book—OH MY GOSH. please look up the trigger warnings. the tears would not stop. it sounds dramatic but these characters feel so insanelyreal.the way Bri’s emotions were expressed had my heart racking around in my chest.so now that you can picture me literally breaking down over a book, i want to move on and try to convey how much i appreciate Abby Jimenez’s books. her writing and her characters and everything. the fact that she puts her all into these, accurately representing anxiety, adding so many emotional themes, creating real conflicts, and making sure to write a full ending. the quotes in this?? i ran out of tabs. like completely. i subconsciously kept reaching for them and i didn’t even need to look. this book made me FEEL things right off the bat. i really hope my mom isn’t mad that her book is completely covered in tabs. i might keep this for myself and buy her a new one. this book is precious to me. i know for a fact that days later, i’ll see this on my shelf and admire it. i’ll remember how lovely and beautiful this story was. i’ll think of Bri and Jacob and the incredible life they’ll have (THEY’RE REAL, OKAY?). i haven’t read book like this in a long time. it’ll be a while before i stop thinking about it.i will never stop recommending this book to romance lovers. it’s one of the best.QUOTESI was rendered frozen and speechless and completely at her mercy, and I had to wonder with a touch of awe and amusement if she had bewitched me. If I was under some spell. Because I’d never felt like this before, this compelled to do something for someone I just met, this drawn to anyone.Damn, he was handsome. It seemed cliché, but his smile really did light up a room. Bright and dazzlingly gorgeous—and he didn’t do it a lot. You really had to draw him out and earn it. I enjoyed earning it.I was stupid for this man. He had me all turned over and inside out. Just looking at him made me happy. I wanted to run down the steps and jump on him and kiss his face like an excited puppy.I adored him. I literallyadoredhim. He was so sweet, and kind, and funny, and self-deprecating, and awkwardly loveable. I had this deep urge to take care of him and baby him and just love all over him.“Do you need a hug?” I asked.He drew his brows down. “What?”“You look like you need a hug. Can I hug you?”He gave me one of his quiet pauses. And then he nodded. “Yes.”I closed the distance between us and wrapped my arms around him. “I am here foryou,”I whispered. “We’ll get through this together and everything will be okay.”She gave me a serious look and I couldn’t help but smile. She was so,sobeautiful.It was weird to say, but she made me feel alone—the way I felt when I was by myself. Calm and unaffected. Like it was just us here and not a hundred other people. I liked being alone. Withher.Her mouth fell open. “You sat in the rain just to talk to me?”I looked at my lap for a long moment before looking back up at her. “I’d do a lot more than that for you.”She opened her beautiful eyes and looked at me. “I know all of your quiets. I know when you’re alone with me and you’re quiet, it’s because your brain is still. And when you’re in public and you’re quiet, it’s because your brain is loud. But I don’t know this one. What’s this one?”I held her gaze. “This one’s you.”She snuggled into me and it was everything. My entire universe condensed to a single place and time.“Jacob?” she whispered.I put my nose to her hair. “What?”“I love you.”Even to tell her that I loved her would be something. It seemed a waste to love her as much as I did without her ever knowing it. To be unaware that her very existence was my reason for smiling, for being happy to wake up in the morning.I wanted to die, I loved him so much. I wanted to crawl inside of him and live there. I wanted to spend the rest of my life just being with him. Adoring him. Protecting him. Living in all his quiets. A head on his shoulder in a movie theater. A kiss before bed. A cuddle in the dark. Growing old and holding his hand. Anything he wanted. Anything he needed. I wanted to be his anything.“Jacob, I am so in love with you I can’t even stand it.”“What?”“I’m in love with you too. I thought you—““Say it again.”“I’m…Im in love with you.”I watched the words hit him like a physical thing, pushing the air from his lungs and filling his eyes with hope.He closed the space between us in three long strides and gathered me to him.“Say it again,” he whispered.“I’m in love with you,” I gasped.“Again.”“I’m in love with you.”He laughed, blinking at me through tears.“This is real?” I asked.He nodded. “It’salwaysbeen real.”There’s a special peace in sleeping next to someone you love. When you slip into the dark holding them and wake up and they’re still there and you know that everything that matters is just opening your eyes away.“She’s it, Mom. I think I knew it the moment I laid eyes on her.”'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""Alright, I'm just going to review this really quick before I clock out from work for the day - because I actually deserve to get paid to write this review lol.The beginning of the story started out well, I really loved that both of our MC's are doctors - it really kinda gave me an old schoolGrey's Anatomyvibe. The initial dislike of each other and the banter there in the hospital.After that it really falls flat for me. I feel like I'm out here on Outlier Island again but when it comes to Abby's books, and I know this only the second one I've read but it seems to be trending with me. I feel like I get some of the romance even if it's corny but I don't get the second part - you know the comedy in the Rom-Com. Might just be me but meh.Around 40-50ish % in the book, the miscommunication trope is coming through real strong. I don't mind it from time to time if it's short lived and well, done right. This miscommunication was so stupid and dragged out beyond reasonable expectations. At 85% of the book both Jacob and Briana are still acting oblivious.╰┈➤˗ˏˋ I really did likeJacob, although he did come across as kind of a doormat to me and I'm not a fan of a pushover MMC.╰┈➤˗ˏˋAnd not because of his anxiety - I'm referencing how he was with the FMC.

Questioning every single thing and making the most ridiculous assumptions.Overall, it just felt like another corny book from AJ - to me, I feel like I might just not vibe with her writing.

It also doesn’t help that he suffers from “social anxiety” in new situations.NEVER say NEVER…So, he tries to right his first missteps by writing her a good old fashioned letter, as he is much better at expressing himself when he has time to think about his words-and a friendship is born. ✍🏻💌And, when she discovers that he has a three legged dog named Lieutenant Dan, AND that he has volunteered to be her brother’s kidney donor, ANONYMOUSLY, she realizes that he may not be the Villain she thought he was.How can she ever repay him?Turns out, she can help him out by pretending to be his new girlfriend, at the engagement and wedding events for Jeremiah and Amy-so that his family can celebrate without guilt, assured that he has moved on and is happy again-and that he is happy for them.Briana and Jacob agree to always be HARMLESS to each other-to never cause the other pain.MAYBE, just MAYBE-their own happily ever after, will be the result?Abby Jimenez writes my absolute FAVORITE romances, filled with great loves, great friendships, good humor and dogs! 🐶And, she always includes a challenge for at least one of her characters which enlightens us on a more serious subject without taking away from the HAPPY.This time it’s kidney failure and organ donation.I loved her 3 part FRIEND ZONE series (The Friend Zone, The Happy Ever After Playlist and Life’s Too Short) and I equally love this two part series, “Part of Your World” and “Yours Truly”.Review for Part of Your World:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...I hope she is hard at work on her next novel-I can’t wait! ❤️AVAILABLE NOW!Thank You to the Chandler Public Library for the loan of this title!'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I carried this book around for >2 weeks and I’m really disappointed to say it didn’t work for me :(There were a few things that really bugged me- Miscommunication- The ; « I’ll never have a serious relationship again because I got hurt » thing.

Absolutely awesome read 👏🏼🌟'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'There were some things I liked about Yours Truly, but overall, the experience was a disappointment. I felt SO betrayed by the fact that this book started off with two of my favorite tropes (fake dating + epistolary) just to slap me in the face with two of my MOST HATED tropes in the second half (tropes, major spoilers):HUGE miscommunication AND lack of communication + ACCIDENTAL PREGNANCYthat leads to (plot, major spoilers):ONE OF THE WORST DRAMA-INDUCED FREAKOUTS I\'VE EVER SEEN by the FMC.😩 By the way, that last trope? (Major spoiler) by the end of the book, we have FOUR characters who arepregnant: Alexis, Jacob\'s ex, Nick\'s wife, and Briana. Not all are accidental or anything, and Alexis made sense. But three NEW ones in one book felt mind-boggling to not have this be in the blurb or something.LOOK, first off, the best thing about this book -- similarly to POFW -- is that I LOVED Jacob as a MMC. I truly do. I felt that Abby definitely explored his anxiety really well here in both Briana and Jacob\'s POVs. He gets amazing vulnerable moments and is so loveable and loving, just as Briana states multiple times. I loved that Briana understood how to be there for him from the get-go, and that they had a pretty cute initial build up with the initial friendship/romance with the epistolary romance vibes of letter exchanging! The second thing that I loved was that when things went to the fake dating, the progression felt pretty natural. Yes, the circumstances were a bit iffy in terms of the why, but I still believed in Briana\'s reasonings, and Jacob\'s made sense to me as well. Things started to take an initial turn when the comfy ""this is easy"" vibes that I was getting from the couple in first half of the book kind of stayed too singular-noted. By the time we get to the ""is this real?"" part, I really didn\'t really feel it.Which then made everything in the second half go down hill. 😭 It makes sense for there to besomemiscommunication, particularly in fake dating as there obviously needs to be the ""is this real or not?"" type of thoughts by the characters. There was just WAY too much here for my tastes. On top of that, both Briana and Jacob describe how things are different with each other compared to their respective exes in their POVs SO OFTEN that it just kind of got really repetitive.And dear god, the third act??? The third act was such a mess. 😭 I could sympathize somewhat with Briana\'s trajectory because it is realistic to have the kinds of thoughts she had with the history she had, but at the same time it almost quite literally undid EVERYTHING that she had gone through in the whole book that it completely baffled me. Abby also seemed to throw in some plot points for the sake of plot that just made things worse. Major spoilers:Briana specifically spends the whole book learning to trust Jacob, realizing how different he is than other guys in her past. I get she\'s stressed out and freaking out about the pregnancy, but then why was that a plot point in the first place? It felt so forced, and I hate when motherhood is forced on a character for the sake of plot. Why would they have unprotected sex if she wasn\'t wanting to get serious with anyone, or why didn\'t they have that conversation? Why wouldn\'t Jacob have told her that she was the one earlier after saying it in his dialogue like 2-3 times?On top of that, her freaking out about Nick also came out of left field to me along with the new information about a past miscarriage. I get he was in her life for a long time, but again, she spent the whole time seeing how Jacob could be trustworthy, he literally has her go through his phone, changes his passcode to be the same as hers. And then for her to say that because he\'s a guy, he\'s ""just like the rest of them?"" WHAT THE FUCK? 😩I get so tired of the sexism in romances where characters talk about how guys are just all the same or how there aren\'t any ""good guys"" out there. I\'m all for feminism, but it\'s just so baffling when the MMC has proven to her time and time again how he\'s an amazing person, how devoted he was to her so why did HE need to grovel?

Why did I love it so much?Let’s start with the writing. Every page was impressive. The prose was spot-on and there were so many sentences I wanted to underline or reread. The dialogues were saturated with meaning and humor. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about the writing style.Then we have the characters. The author has a real gift when it comes to creating real, complex characters. She crafted unique personalities where their choices fitted perfectly with their traits. Some authors struggles with getting into the head of characters, but this author managed to bring new people into my life and I got fond of them. I didn’t want to say goodbye to them.In addition to the humans, there was the most original and wonderful POV; the bright octopus. It was a delight to read those chapters. I actually cried after reading about the last thing he did for Tova and she for him. How many authors are able to make you cry because of an octopus?The plot was intricate and well-thought through. I was invested from the first to last page and found myself saying ‘No’ in horror when some of the misunderstandings threatened the happiness of my new fictional best friends. Sometimes I thought; why didn’t you realize that? But then the author described why based on the personality and history of the character and it made me realize how easily we can misjudge and act in a way that potentially harms us.I loved the ending although it was hard to say goodbye. I could have wandered around in their universe forever.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I wrongread the crap out of this one. I totally get why this has been such a hit for others. I mean, the world is shit and fiction is a great place to turn when you need something hopeful. I’ve fallen victim to the right time/right place heartstring-tugger a time or twelve myself. (See A Man Called Ove, The House in the Cerulean Sea, The Guncle, etc.) And like everyone else, I loved Marcellus and heard the “Sad Cat Diary” narrator each time he voiced a chapter that really brought a smile to my face . . . .But oh my god how did y’all tolerate Cameron? Freaking spoiled manbaby! So sorry your momma was a deadbeat and ditched you as a kid, but it’s not like you got dumped into the foster care system to rot. No, you were left with an aunt who not only loved you but coddled your ass into your dang 30s. Grow up, butthole! I broke my normal routine and poked around a few reviews since everyone but me loved this and I’ve noticed most don’t even mention him at all – despite him being a main character in the story. Maybe you all were simply able to ignore him???? I love a loveable loser, but this dude was a user and no redemption arc could make me like him.2.5 Stars'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'The book was incredibly slow and very mundane at times. More than halfway through nothing significant had happened. There were a few chapters that were completely pointless and didn\'t contribute to the story in any way.The author failed to give enough reasons for me to care about any of the characters. They all felt predictable and halfhearted.Cameron\'s character was just the regular annoying, whiny kind of loser who blames everybody else for his ""hard"" life. We are constantly reminded how smart he is and yet the only way his smarts present themselves is through some random trivia. A 30 year old man who was raised by an aunt who made sure he had a roof over his head, rather than just being thrown into the system, who still blames his mother for all of his life choices and mistakes, is not someone I can feel sorry for. Grow up and get your act together ffs.Marcellus was the only thing that kept the whole book together and he should have been given more space in it. I would have gladly read an entire book told only from his perspective.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Marcellus the octopus!!! *heart eyes forever*I don’t read a lot of literary fiction, but I was utterly charmed by this book.

Tova has always felt that keeping busy was the best way to cope with the things that life throws at you. She also knows a lot about loss, her son Eric aged 18, disappeared 30 years ago, after taking out a boat on Puget sound.Marcellus is a 60 lb Giant Pacific Octopus who has been living in the Aquarium for several years. He was a rescue but Marcellus considers himself a captive and dreams of returning to the sea. He is also highly intelligent and quite adept at escaping his tank when he wants to roam about!Cameron is a young man who has come to town looking for the father he never knew. His mother left when he was young and he was raised by his aunt.The story is told from the point of view of these three characters.WHAT I LOVED ABOUT THIS AUDIOBOOK:The star of this novel is definitely Marcellus and I enjoyed his POV the most!The narrators were absolutely great and the voice of Marcellus is just as I expected it would be, he is intelligent, a bit of a grouch but has formed a bond with Tova.The setting of Puget sound is described in all of it’s splendor, I could easily picture the glistening blue waters and almost smell the salt in the air!While fanciful, this story still had me engaged throughout. The novel is nicely paced and I was never bored.After listening to this book and loving it, I of course had to Google The Giant Pacific Octopus. I found that it is indeed extremely intelligent and there are many articles about them solving puzzles, escaping from enclosures, etc. You will enjoy learning more about them if you liked this novel!While the story is somewhat predictable it was still fun to listen to how these two humans and one octopus would solve the mystery of Tova’s missing son.If you believe that animals can bring comfort and happiness to a person’s life and can help you heal from life's tragedies, you will love this book!! It is quirky and fun but there are also some serious issues described.I received this audiobook from the publisher through NetGalley and Harper Audio. It was my pleasure to listen to and review this wonderful story!Publication date is May 3, 2022""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Incredible!! 5+ stars and highly recommend!I listened to Shelby Van Pelt's book,Remarkably Bright Creatures, on audiobook and I highly recommend listening to the book. Michael Urie does a phenomenal job as Marcellus, a giant Pacific octopus who is smarter than humans and is an escape artist at night from his tank (captivity) at Sowell Bay Aquarium. Marin Ireland narrates other characters and has an amazing Scottish brogue for the character of Ethan.Like other book reviewers, I was skeptical about a book regarding an octopus but I was immediately captivated. Similar to other reviewers, I researched octopus information and they are considered the most intelligent of all invertebrates and they can radically alter their body shape to squeeze through small gaps.The character development, dialogue, and drama of Tova, Cameron, Ethan, and Avery are terrific. Van Pelt does an amazing job on dealing with tough topics like death, loss, and grief as well as more positive issues of relationships, friendship, and interconnectedness.Highly recommend!""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'When I heard the premise of this book, I imagined an octopus POV would be used as the jumping point for reflections on captivity, ""otherness"", different forms of intelligence, or respect of nature... sadly I found none of that here.It\'s just your average ""intersecting destinies"" story with a very predictable plot proceeding at a snail-like pace.The writing style is similarly unremarkable. It is built from three POVs, one of which belongs to an octopus (great!), one to an unremarkable old lady (less great) and one to an absolutely insufferable, whiny man-child who talks in the kind of overly colloquial writing style (""bicep day\'s been lit at the gym lately"") that I really cannot stand (definitely not great).Overall, a waste of a good cephalopod.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4.5⭐️Seventy-year-old Tova Sullivan works the nightshift as a cleaner at Sowell Bay Aquarium. She lives alone, recently widowed and her eighteen-year-old son having disappeared almost thirty years ago. Though financially stable, Tova believes in keeping herself occupied and enjoys her work and the company of the aquatic life in the aquarium, among whom is Marcellus, a giant Pacific octopus, who was taken in as a rescue and at the beginning of the novel is on Day 1299 of his four-year (1460 day) life span. His observations and ruminations on human beings (which are shared in the first person in snippets throughout the narrative) are laced with humor (with a touch of snark) and wisdom. He is after all a ‘remarkably bright creature’ who also happens to venture out of his tank at nighttime, never exceeding the eighteen minutes beyond which would result in “consequences” as he cannot survive longer than that outside his tank. On one of his nocturnal adventures, Tova ends up saving him from harm and they form a special bond. Though Tova has a supportive group of friends, she is concerned about not having anyone to look after her in her advanced age and begins to consider the option of selling her home and moving into an upscale retirement facility. As the story progresses we also meet thirty-year-old Cameron Cassmore who travels to Sowell Bay, Washington from Modesto, California in search of information about his family connections. Abandoned by his mother as a child and raised by his aunt, he has recently become aware of possible family connections that lead him to Sowell Bay. He hasn’t done much with his life till now, is unable to hold a steady job and has been recently dumped by his girlfriend who was fed up with his lack of initiative and whimsical nature. Cameron, Tova and Marcellus connect when he starts working at the aquarium and what follows is a deeply moving story of friendship, community, family, grief and moving on.The author’s portrayal of a close-knit small-town community and sensitive depiction of issues such as loss, grief, loneliness and aging will touch your heart. Though the plot is somewhat predictable, the story is very well told and nowhere in the narrative do you lose interest or experience boredom. Marcellus is adorable and is a reminder of how precious our animal friends are to us especially in moments of loneliness and sorrow. The story also makes you ponder over the plight of animals in captivity. Though none of the animals in this story were harmed or ill-treated, you cannot help but feel sympathy for Marcellus when he feels imprisoned within the glass walls of the aquarium and misses his natural habitat.Set in the beautiful Pacific Northwest, with a lively cast of characters (human and cephalopod), engaging and well-paced narrative and a perfect combination of emotion, humor, wit and wisdom (suspend disbelief and you will enjoy the story!), Shelby Van Pelt’s Remarkably Bright Creatures is a beautiful story that will tug at your heartstrings and leave you with a lump in your throat and a smile on your face.I thank the author and publisher for providing a DRC of this wonderful book via Edelweiss+. All opinions expressed here are my own.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Remarkably Bright Creatures by Shelby Van PeltNarrated by Marin Ireland and Michael UrieSeventy year old Tova Sullivan loves her job working the night shift at the Sowell Bay Aquarium. Doing this job helps her with the grief of losing her husband. There is another grief that has been with her for many decades, since her eighteen year old son died, his body never found.Tova loves cleaning the floors, windows, tanks, and the seal statue that was a favorite of her son when he was little. For Tova, this job is a life saver, a place for her to be, a place she is needed, welcomed, and cherished by the aquarium manager. And then something very special happens! Tova meets curmudgeonly Marcellus, a giant Pacific octopus living at the aquarium. She already knew Marcellus, just as she knew all the other aquarium creatures but she never KNEW him before she and Marcellus meet face to face in an amazing way. Thus begins a lifelong friendship between Tova and Marcellus. Lifelong considering the short length of life that Marcellus has left since he is at the end of his four year lifespan.There is another important person in this story and it's thirty year old Cameron Cassmore, a man who has never really grown up or found his place in life. He's never met his father and his mother abandoned him when he was nine. Cameron has a lot of growing up to do, having never held a job that he wasn't fired from, having never learned to pick up his own socks, and having never been someone anyone could rely on. But he's in Sowell Bay now, on the prowl to find out the secrets to his past, hoping what he finds will pay off, if possible.I loved this story, the people, Marcellus, and gray Cat. The audiobook narration could not be better. Marin Ireland does her usual wonderful job while Michael Urie IS Marcellus. He's now a new favorite narrator of mine. I avoid animal stories because I usually can't handle things happening to animals but this is a story about giving life to both animals and humans and that giving makes future loss bearable. Even if we can't keep something forever, we don't want to miss the chance of the time we can spend with those we can love and cherish.Pub May 3, 2022 by HarperAudio""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'This book is very popular and adored by so many so I\'m just going to keep this short.I feel a bit disappointed like I read a different book. I thought the first half was very good and I even chuckled at parts. After a while, I realized that I\'m constantly waiting for Marcellus to show up. I love his POV and it reminds me of the octopus in ""Resident Alien"" TV show. While waiting for him, I become increasingly annoyed by one of the characters. 😫 And I\'m sorry to say, I have very little interest in the other character.I feel like I might regret not giving it a higher rating, a bit of ""Frick Island"" Deja Vu.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5 just go with it starsThere have been lots of books between dogs and cats forming impressive bonds with humans.

Tova is the seventy year old woman that cleans the aquarium where Marcellus is a prisoner, as he sees it. She’s a widow and her 18 year old son went missing decades earlier.I had enjoyed watching My Octopus Teacher on Netflix earlier this year. And Van Pelt does an equally good job of showing the reader how smart octopuses are.The story weaves in other characters - a thirty year old still trying to find his footing and also the father he never knew, a transplanted Scot who runs the local deli and store. I found myself drawn to each and every one of them. This is a lovely heartwarming story. It deals with growing old alone, grief, growing up belatedly. It grabbed my heart. I loved the magic realism of this story.Both narrators do a great job. This made for a delightful audio experience. Michael Urle was superb as Marcellus. Marin Ireland always does a great job and this time is no exception.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""I wish I could rate this book higher.I loved Tova and Marcellus so much. They get 5 stars easily.But Cameron is such a horrible cry baby/man child I give him 0 stars. How is he 30, but every decision he makes is so infantile and selfish? For example, if he had to cancel a date, why wouldn't he call the person instead of going to her place of business and telling her tèenager? Sure, he becomes less horrible by the end, but I disliked him so much by then that I didn't care, and honestly, I doubted his character arc. No one that far behind in life would be able to become a functional adult so quickly.Also there were a lot of things in this debut novel that didn't ring true for the modern era and seemed to take up a lot of time just to add drama. Like the hunt for the real estate guy just took so long. Any middle-aged real estate agent would have a Facebook page. Cam could have looked him up and dmed him, no need to drive a fuel inefficient vehicle all over Washington.I can see why this is such a popular book there are a lot of heart warming aspects like the Octopus detective and the rich character descriptions are great, but I just couldn't stomach Cameron who thought it was OK to walk around with chocolate on his face, smelling like other people's urine.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""I'm sure many may disagree with this review, based on the love that this book has received, but I really didn't find anything special here.

I should mention that one learns a bit about the lives of giant octopi and how Marcellus came to live in a tank in a aquarium.The narrators were great.

After watching and lovingMy Octopus Teacheron Netflix, I’m more than a little obsessed with these amazing, intelligent creatures. This is my second book featuring octopuses (no, it’s not octopi), in as many months.Tova, the 70-year-old cleaning lady at the aquarium, is grieving the recent loss of her husband, and the son who disappeared 30 years ago. Outside of work, I enjoyed the interactions she had with her friends, the Knit Wits. Marcellus, a giant Pacific octopus who lives in the aquarium, is nearing the end of his short (4-ish) life, having never known freedom, despite his nightly escapes to other tanks to get a tasty snack. Cameron is the new employee, a struggling young man who is on a quest to find the father he never knew.The chapters alternate between these three characters, and while I enjoyed all three, I wanted more of Marcellus. He is a grumpy old man with a heart of gold. The best part is we are privy to his witty and snarky thoughts, usually about humans. Snark gets me every time.How these three lives intertwine makes for a heartwarming, feel-good story. There’s a mystery to solve, one Marcellus has figured out. He only has to find a way to get the humans to piece the puzzle together. He might be curmudgeonly, but he has a soft spot for these two, especially Tova, with whom he shares a strong bond. You know where the story is going, but it’s OK, because the journey there is charming and delightful. Marcellus, of course, stole my heart, putting a smile on my face, and a lump in my throat.Readers who enjoy Fredrik Backman, (although he’s hit or miss with me), will likely love this one too.* I received a digital copy of this book via NetGalley.

Not I.In the first third of the novel, it was painfully obvious how the story would conclude.Do you remember Romeo and Juliet? Mr. Shakespeare was the King of Spoilers when he tells us the outcome of the ill-fated lovers in the very first paragraph. But he told a story worthy of rippling through the ages.In contrast, Remarkably Bright Creatures is boring. The storytelling needed sharpening because most of the book was superfluous and should have been distilled to the dialogue.Additionally, the narrative voice is lackluster (aside from the Marcellus/octopus sections). This book would have benefited from some hilarious moments or some snarky comments.

Plus, an octopus is one of the main characters! Who doesn’t love a good cephalopod story? For those who are familiar with octopuses and their clever antics, you enjoy this story.Marcellus McSquiddles, a giant Pacific octopus who is held in Sowell Bay Aquarium (and a bit of a curmudgeon) begins the story narrating his life in captivity. He has a special relationship with the nightly cleaner, Tova Sullivan. Tova is a widower whose eighteen-year-old son went missing over thirty years ago, and she still feels the loss daily. Tova is an excellent cleaner who takes her job seriously. She’s seventy years old and is on the verge of retiring. Yet she loves all her exhibits of sea life.Tova is part of a group of women who call themselves “the Knit-Wits” who also provide some smiles in this wonderful read, and she works at the aquarium at night. Marcellus has been getting bold in his endeavors to find tasty fresh seafood. Yes, he has fun escaping a nibbling on other exhibits and keeping Tova on her toes.Other main characters are Ethan, a Scotsman who owns the local grocery story, and has a romantic interest in Tova, although she doesn’t see it. A young man named Cameron comes to Sowell Bay in search of his father. He finds a job in the grocery store working for Ethan.Author Shelby Van Pelt expertly weaves the characters’ stories together. Although each character has sad emotional issues such as loss, grief, aging, and secrets, the story remains hopeful. Van Pelt keeps the secrets hidden from the reader, and the unveiling of the secrets is a reader’s joy. Marcellus has the best secrets.The chapters are short which leads to the reading enjoyment along with the wonderful prose and observations. Life is sad and can be devastatingly difficult to endure, yet Van Pelt writes of the human spirit, the human need to find light and happiness.This is a remarkably endearing read!'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""AsSwayeis my witness, I called this book’s ending on page four. Well, half the ending.And you probably will, too.This novel isn’t out to surprise (or, if it is, that's a big fail-o-rama), save with its novel octopus POV. Mostly, it’s a bittersweet reflection on grief and aging and loneliness and family.And all of these topics are worthy of meditation.As for the writing itself: some of it feels inspired, but most of it does not. Around our female lead, Tova, everything crackles and glows. The dialogue feels right. The sorrow and grit are there. Same with our octopus lead, Marcellus. But the other characters feel less fully realized.My advice if you plan to read this novel: lay down any expectations of elegant prose and intricate character development in all but the two main players. And even there, don’t get crazy. This is a simple, mainstream novel, with an interesting sea creature twist. It’s a beach read, or a palette cleanser in between meatier works. Sorry, but them’s the facts.Two things didreally bother meduring this mostly decent, if unremarkable, read. May I get them off my chest?First, Shelby Van Pelt is not a master of nuanced foreshadowing. I can’t give you specific examples, or I’ll spoil the plot, but I was bludgeoned by hints of things to come. I found myself thinking: I’m not an idiot, lady. You don’t have to hit me over the head with your clues.Second, Van Pelt is absolutely in love with the word “some,” and not in a good way. Normal people probably won't trouble at this, but I get OCD with my pet peeves. Please allow me to give you three examples of how the author’s use of the word “some” drove me apeshit by story’s end:1. “Two clicks to downloadsome travel apphe saw a commercial about, withsome schtickabout guaranteeing rock-bottom prices” (104).So... to clarify: do you not know which travel app he used? Or, could you not make one up?2. “I was watchingsome showon the travel channel the other day” (245).Which show, now?3. “They were interviewing him about trends in vacation home sales orsome boring thing” (245).Wait, please. Were they interviewing him about trends in vacation home sales, or about “some” other “boring thing”? What exactly did this supposed interview entail, Ms. Van Pelt? You’re the only one who knows for sure, and I’d really like to be looped in.…I’ve given you three examples here, but the author does this at least 100 times in 360 pages. I’m not exaggerating. And to me, this feels lazy. An author’s job is to create a believable world, full of believable details. Vagaries do not achieve this end, especially in such abundance.In closing, I was really looking forward to reading this story, and I was mildly disappointed with it. Really, I got more pleasure from reading other people’s reviews about the novelty of an octopus narrator than I got from reading the actual book. Oh well, that’s life sometimes.My consolation prize, stimulating dialogue with a savvy buddy-reader, more than makes up for this otherwise lackluster experience.Book/Song Pairing: Never Let Me Go (Florence + The Machine)youtu.be/zMBTvuUlm98""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""4.2⭐️ what a ride through a genre I didn't know existed 🥺💙✔️ domestic fiction✔️ feel-good mystery✔️ exploration of friendship✔️ coastal setting✔️ three povs-randomolder lady's pov (Tova)-randomyoung man's pov (Cameron)- giant pacific octopus's povSuch are the secrets the sea holds.

He was “rescued” as an injured juvenile and has, at most just 160 days left, until his sentence is complete.Crabs, Clams, Shrimp, Scallops, Cockles, Abalones, fish and fish eggs would be his normal diet in the sea…but, he is served Mackerel, Halibut and Herring at the Sowell Bay Aquarium-MOSTLY herring due to their low cost. Ick!So, you cannot blame “the guy” for escaping from his tank, overnight when something “tastier” is within reach.Day 1,300 of CaptivityMarcellus almost didn’t survive the 159 days remaining.If the aquarium’s oldest employee, a 70 year old cleaning lady, named Tova Sullivan hadn’t found him right as the 18 minutes he could survive outside of water was just about up, day 1,300 may have been his last.Because the Octopus is a “remarkably, bright creature”-a bond is formed, but unfortunately, Tova is injured while helping the 60 pound Cephalopoda.Tova can’t just sit home at night. Evening is the most difficult time for the widow who recently lost her husband of 47 years, and has no surviving children after losing her only son Erik, when he was just 18. So, she decides to “train” the new guy, Cameron Cassmore, who will be temporarily cleaning the Aquarium while she recovers.She, (and Marcellus-who is more observant than ANY human) will find themselves involved in the mystery about what brought the “new guy” to town-JUST the stimulation a bored Octopus needed!I was concerned about picking up this book when it first became popular on my Goodreads feed. I didn’t want to become attached to Marcellus just to read about him getting injured or dying.NOT TO WORRY! The details of his final day are NOT described in this story.Marcellus IS the star in the way that a “supporting actor” often steals the show! He is the thread that binds the three narratives together despite having the fewest chapters.But, this is just as much a story about a community, and a gentle reminder that ENDINGS also bring about new BEGINNINGS.Sometimes you find something that you didn’t even realize you were looking for!!This is a NOT TO BE MISSED delightful DEBUT that had me joyfully humming that Beatles tune for days after finishing ! AVAILABLE NOW!A buddy read with DeAnn! Check out her amazing review for additional thoughts!!Thank You to the Chandler Public Library for the loan of the Audible and a Physical copy of the book. It was fun toggling between the two! 💕'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""4.5, rounded upI want suction marks on MY arm!You don’t give me a huge, wise old octopus and then have him take a back seat. Well, toward the end of the book, he (our octopus named Marcellus) gets more airtime, but at the beginning I’d say his presence is a tease.My favorite things were the suction marks that Marcellus made when he wrapped his tentacles around an arm of Tova, a 70-year-old janitor at an aquarium. I was jealous! Branded by an octopus, hot diggety! I know, most people wouldn’t like having suction marks all over their arm—the big purple dots would probably look like hickies. And what is an old lady doing with a bunch of hickies on her arm anyway? (Forget that fantasy, please!) But I pictured the marks as perfectly round polka dots, a beautiful and unique henna design. Tattoos to love! (I’m also assuming they didn’t hurt, of course.) No one would every guess they were suction marks made by a friendly octopus. We see lots of secrets in our lit, but come on, has anyone ever had to keep THAT kind of secret?! Imagine her spilling the beans when someone asked her what the hell those bruises on her arm were. “Oh, an octopus was wrapped around my arm for a bit. No biggie.”This is the story of Tova the janitor and Marcellus the octopus, both old-timers. Don’t worry, we don’t have a talking octopus here (he and Tova don’t have conversations)—that would have been a turnoff for me. Instead, we get to hear Marcellus’s clever thoughts as he observes the humans around him. He’s a wise creature who occasionally escapes his tank in search of food treats. He’s funny and smart. (In real life, octopuses are smart—a cool fact that had me running to Google to learn more.) Oh, and Marcellus is curmudgeonly—but yet he’s also very helpful. Putting tape over my mouth because I don’t want to give anything away.The story is also about a guy named Cameron, who is searching for his dad. The chapters alternate between him, Tova, and Marcellus. I loved Marcellus’s chapters the best. His observations about humans are a riot (like, why do they call him a “smart cookie”?). His chapters are short and I always wanted more; it was a jolt to move to a realistic story all of the sudden and it was always a slight comedown.Oh, the realistic story is well done, don’t get me wrong. I loved both Tova and Cameron—both sympathetic and well-drawn. The writing is good. The plot is interesting and fast moving, but there is one huge coincidence that you have to buy into. I overlooked that the situation was unlikely because I liked the book so much. Also, the ending is a little too tight for my liking, but then again, it’s heartwarming. Who doesn’t want a feel-good ending these days?It didn’t hurt that the book is set in my hood, a town near Seattle. I had to laugh—Tova doesn’t like to drive on freeways anymore. And she had to head to Bellingham, a (real) town two hours away. I’m the same age and I won’t drive on freeways anymore, either—and a friend moving to Bellingham was a disaster for me because I couldn’t drive to visit her. I loved that little similarity—funny that it was the very same town! Although Tova and I had age and a fear of freeways in common, I did not identify with her need to clean. But I can definitely see myself liking an octopus like she did.I realize that I like more edge, which I thought I would get, of course, with an octopus as a main character. The deal is, it’s realistic fiction with a dab of magical realism. It sort of reminds me of Kevin Wilson’sNothing to See Here, which I loved. In Wilson’s book, we have a realistic story line, but it also happens to have kids who explode. Here, we also have a realistic story line, but it’s an octopus that’s the weird part. Marcellus reminds me a little of cool Charlotte the spider in the kids’ book,Charlotte's Web.I loved this book—and its bright cover—and I’ll be checking out the author’s next offering. This is a strong debut! And of course, I’ll be reading more about those smart-cookie octopuses!Thanks to Edelweiss for an advance copy.""}]"

She’s come a long way from the small town where she grew up—she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. And when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life seems too good to be true.Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan—her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.","[{'rating': 2, 'content': '➥ 2 Stars *:･ﾟ✧""People spend so much time wondering why the women don\'t leave. Where are all the people who wonder why the men are even abusive? Isn\'t that where the only blame should be placed?""━━━━━━━━━━━ ♡ ━━━━━━━━━━━tw: graphic domestic violence, graphic attempted rape, suicide, depression, alcohol abuse, depressionUpdate:One of my Goodreads friends broughtthis articleto my attention: an article by domesticshelters.org that outlines the harmfulness of this book. Definitely worth the read.I’ve rewritten this review three times now, andeach time I’ve felt it necessary to lower my rating.I don’t intend for this to be a hot take. I’m not trying to be unique or quirky for disliking a popular book but every day I grow more and more concerned with the number of people who misinterpret and romanticize this book. There will be spoilers in this review.I’d like to begin by acknowledging Colleen Hoover’s intent with this book and how I believe it is a serious problem.Firstly,Colleen Hoover has expressed her disapproval and dislike for trigger warnings.She expressed that“as a fellow reader with my fair share of past experiences, I understand that there are issues some people do not want to read about. But as a writer, there are many things I don’t want revealed in the blurbs of my books.”This is extremely irresponsible and inconsiderate of an author.Furthermore, this book has been and is marketed as a love triangle andColleen Hoover employs the fact that Ryle is an abusive fucker as a plot-twist.In the author’s note, she states that “In the past, I’ve always said I write for entertainment purposes only. I don’t write to educate, persuade or inform. This book is different.”Yet, she continues to format this more serious book, similarly.Furthermore, although I understand that Colleen“wanted to write something realistic to the situation my mother was in – a situation a lot of women find themselves in”, I feel that Ryle was very different to her father.This coming explanation is just my presumption and random thought process. I could have greatly misinterpreted what Colleen went through and I do not mean to be disrespectful.I do not doubt that domestic abuse can be very different, but I believe the fact that Colleen’s father was an alcoholic has a huge impact on her final opinion of him. One could argue that her father needed help, and that although he is to blame, it did not come purely from malintent and manipulation. I am not saying that he is redeemable by any means, only that part of the violence can be due to an unintentional factor. Ryle still ends up having custody over the baby. This is infuriating to me.But we see that she wrote it this way because Colleen still had a relationship with her abusive father after her mother divorced him.Then we have the way that Colleen\'s father continues to (in my opinion) manipulate her by showing kind, good aspects of himself, like agreeing and encouraging Colleen’s stepfather to walk her down the isle rather than him. Just a thought or something to possibly consider.And in this book, we see Ryle presented as, not a bad person, instead, only a""person who does bad things"".Now, I\'ve been thinking about this line.I wonder if it was Colleen’s intention to have Ryle say this line to purposefully show how he manipulates Lily into having this mindset or if Colleen really does think this way.Ryle is indeed a bad person, and abuser who is irredeemable. I understand and agree that it is at times, difficult to label someone as “bad” or “good” as it is more complicated than that. But there comes a point, that person is a bad person (for instance, when he tries to horrifically rape her and guilt-tripped Lily with his trauma). Colleen attempts to evoke confliction in the reader by writing in that Ryle donates to charity. Yet, this is not enough. One donation does not make you a good person, especially when compared to the severe harm that you’ve caused others. I cannot believe that after Ryle attempted to rape Lily, there are still Ryle apologists out there. That moment was absolutely mortifying.Regardless, the general plotline of this book is supposed to be that Ryle starts off as being a kind, loveable man with whom Lily and the reader fall in love with. But, his abusive and manipulative tendencies are slowly revealed until it becomes clear that he is an abuser and that this is a case of domestic abuse. However,from the beginning of the book, Ryle is already portrayed as a concerningly violent and manipulative man.We are introduced to his character when Lily finds him kicking a chair out of anger, something unacceptable and very worrying. Later on,he begs and successfully coerces Lily into having sex with him, purely and solely because he wants to.Unfortunately, at this point in the story, many people still like, possibly even love, Ryle. This is not the ""turning point"" per se.I’ve also recently seen many people criticizing Colleen Hoover’s ability to write a healthy relationship and I’m beginning to agree. Although I remember enjoying Ugly Love, it was certainly unhealthy, specifically in the way that our female main character was treated. Then I began to read ""November 9"" and was utterly mortified by the way Ben, our love interest, acted. There are plenty of reviews with quotes etc. that show how horribly and scarily Ben treated Fallon from the beginning, before the plot twist.So, I conclude that Colleen’s failure to properly structure a base for the story to build upon was a main concern.In regards to Ryle’s trauma,it is something that he weaponizes to manipulate and guilt-trip Lily.It does not excuse the abuse and I think it’s gravely concerning for people to blame the abuse on his trauma. Although it’s understandable to feel bad for what he had to go through, it is all used to manipulate and abuse Lily.Then we have Atlas. When I first read this book, I was quite taken with how caring and sweet Lily and Atlas’ childhood romance seemed to be. But upon reflection, I’ve become more and more concerned by Atlas’ presence in this book at all.I’ve seen countless girls swooning over the“I know it wasn’t a pity fuck, Lily. I was there”line, yetAtlas had sex with Lily while she was a minor.I question why Colleen Hoover would choose to make it that way. It’s extremely unnecessary and the illegality of it could have been easily avoided had she chosen for them to be the same age.This again shows Colleen’s inability to write healthy relationships.Furthermore, I found that the side romance in general greatly took away from the purpose of the book.The fact that Lily had to be saved by another man is truly a damaging thing to portray. Many women who experience domestic abuse do not have the option to leave just because there is a better man out there and it’s also damaging to make it seem that Lily is simply picking between Ryle or Atlas.Moreover, this expands my discontent with howColleen chose to shove in aspects of her usual work to something so serious.A side love story was truly unnecessary for this, but I believe Colleen knew that if she wrote something without romance, it would not sell. Can I blame her for that? I’m not quite sure, but it certainly does not please me.Deriving from what I’ve mentioned so far, particularly about Ryle,it bothers me how little conclusion Colleen offers at the end of the book.I have had to have conversation after conversation with people who misinterpreted the book, who still forgive Ryle and who think of “It Ends With Us” as a romance book. For a while, my challenge question (for friend requests) was “What is your favourite (dark) romance book and why?” And I cannot tell you the number of times people answered with “It Ends With Us”. Some people write in their reviews that even though Ryle was not Lily’s ultimate partner and just because it “did not work out”, they will still have love for Ryle in their heart and think that he just needs help. And unfortunately, I don’t think these people are to blame.With Colleen still allowing Ryle to have custody, it almost allows for a small redemption for his character. And I believe at the end of the book, Colleen should have written one page with the cycle of abuse and how it was shown throughout the novel, and a conclusion expressing that if you love Ryle,you should not,because everything that he did, he did itconsciously and with purpose, through manipulation and guilt-tripping(weaponizing his trauma). I do appreciate however, that she included the domestic abuse hotlines.I also thinkit is unacceptable for people to be recommending this book as just a “sad book” or a “book to make you cry”, becausediminishing a book that explores such a difficult and serious topic like domestic abuse, to an object that simply serves the purpose of evoking emotions from you, is extremely disrespectful and shallow.Especially considering that this is such a personal book to Colleen Hoover.Another thing that I found to be really damaging about this book isthe audience.There is this#coquetteaesthetic on tiktok that I am sure you are aware of. I really to like the look of it etc. But it is a theme among this aesthetic to read books like ""It Ends With Us"" and ""Lolita"". I believe both of these texts are greatly misinterpreted, especially considering that it is often young girls who are reading these books from the ages of 11-15. Ignoring Lolita as that is a different topic,I am nearly certain that these girls buy books like “It Ends With Us” purely for the cover.It\'s pink. And it fits the aesthetic.I see people saying that they ""love"" “It Ends With Us” and I find it greatly concerning. What do you love about it? I see people ignoring Lily\'s plotline and just adoring Atlas and his whole ""I know it wasn\'t a pity fuck, Lily. I was there."" They\'ve transformed this as something to romanticise. Not to mention thatI also see girls giggle at what seems to be a little inside joke of theirs when they quote""where did you get the magnet lily""or""you fell down the stairs"".I am really beginning to think that this book has done more harm than good.The writing wasn’t something I had a problem with.When I see people criticize Colleen Hoover, it tends to be becausethey call her writing “wattpad writing” which is stupid, because people will say that any contemporary romance has “wattpad writing”.That’s not a great criticism, they should actually elaborate. Other than the quotes that I’ve disagreed with like“There’s no such thing as a bad person, only people who do bad things”, I found that Colleen Hoover’s writing flows well and that she has some iconic, well thought out quotes.I wasn’t a huge fan of Lily writing her letters to Ellenand I didn’t really care at first, but in the Acknowledgement section of “It Ends With Us”, Colleen actually says thankyou to Ellen DeGeneres saying that she is“light when it comes to darkness”. Considering what an awful person everyone knows that Ellen is, I again struggle to understand why Colleen chose this specific detail when she could have chosen someone that was a much better person and influence. *I have been informed that because this book was written in 2016, Ellen was not known to be a bad person,although I still question Colleen\'s decision to make Lily write letters to a talk show host.Veering off that topic and coming back to my problems with Ryle, is thatI strongly despised how he cared for Lily when she was pregnant.I felt that Ryle cared more about the baby than Lily, and it continues to portray women as baby machines who are made to serve a purpose.The way he cared for her stomach and touched her stomach rather than her. It’s disgusting.Something that also boiled my blood isthe internal misogynythat I see Colleen weave into her books.Lily chooses to not decide whether to divorce Ryle or not until after she has the baby becauseshe believes that her decision would be affected by her hormones.What the fuck?????? Was the fact that he tried to rape you and then he beat you not clear enough?Furthermore, when Lily is trying to explain to Ryle that she wants to divorce him, she tells him something along the lines of“what if this baby girl came home to you and told you ‘daddy, this boy hits me but he apologized and said he wouldn’t do it again’, what if she came home with bruises”, and only then does that garner any sympathy from Ryle.This situation parallels the instances when men only feel remorse for things like sexual assault when they are told ‘what if it was your mother and sister’.It’s horrible and it made me deeply upset that I’ve seen reviews admiring how Ryle was “understanding” after Lily explained that to him.I believe Lily was a strong character to a degree and I agreed with the way she responded to certain things (or I would have done the same), but there are times where I would have been gone, and Lily stayed (like when Ryle begged her for sex). Still, you can really tell she did have a certain level of logic and reason, and tried to confront Ryle.Something that really bugged me was the characterDevinand how Colleen Hoover writes him asthegay stereotype.He\'s overly touchy with Lily, touching her breasts and pulling down her bra without her consent. This is truly such a disgusting and rude way to portray characters of the lgbtq+ community, especially considering that Colleen Hoover rarely diversifies her books(very few poc + lgbtq characters). It mainly frustrates me because Colleen Hoover clearly has a huge income from the sales of her books, and that she cannot be bothered to get sensitivity readers or better editors for these things is so concerning.Another thing that was kind of unnecessary was this line:“A 2-year-old girl will have the same name even when she’s 22, Lily Bloom. Names aren’t something we eventually grow out of.”I understand the meaning behind this sentence, suggesting that parents should put thought into their children\'s names, and that it should suit an adult as much as a child. But I also understand that this can be seen as quite inconsiderate towards transgender people, and just people who change their names in general, because that\'s obviously possible too.There are just so many things that could have been easily avoided, and for these things to not be noticed and fixed is quite lazy of the author.Despite my problems with this book, I think the general idea that Colleen Hoover tried to present in this book was executed decently well at times, hence my two stars.This is a very difficult read, especially if you relate to any of it at all so please do check trigger warnings and be careful because it can be very uncomfortable to see yourself in someone like Lily, or in her position. Much love to anyone who has been through anything like this, I hope you’re okay <3━━━━━━━━━━━ ♡ ━━━━━━━━━━━'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""::: SPOILER-FREE REVIEW :::Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we’ll never get back.HOLY WOW!It Ends With Usis one of the mostpowerfulbooks of 2016 and one of the most raw, honest, inspiring, and profoundly beautiful stories I've ever read. It wasn’t anything like what I expected, but it delivered so much more than I ever hoped for. This is the kind of book that I want to give to every woman and just be like… READ THIS BOOK. NOW. Come to think of it, all the men should read it too. EVERYONE should read this book. Absolutely everyone. It's a story of unshakable love and finding the strength to make the right choice in the hardest situation. I honestly don't think I've ever been prouder of a heroine. I've loved Colleen Hoover's books for a long time because she always writes unique stories... and this one left a lasting mark on my heart. It is a MUST-READ!!This is a completelyspoiler-free review. I'm not even going to add the blurb or tell you what this book is about. It's a Colleen Hoover book. That should be enough to tell you it's amazing. But I really feel that you should just dive into this book without knowing anything about the plot. To be honest, I'm the usually the kind of reader who likes to know every little thing about what to expect in advance, but I've really learned to trust Colleen's writing and her storytelling so even I went into this book without knowing anything at all... and I was blown away by the story!This book isunputdownable. You'll notice as you read that there are no good stopping points. None at all. I began reading it late at night and every time I tried to put it down to go to sleep, I just had to get back up and keep reading because I couldn't stop thinking about it. I didn't finish until almost 5AM but my gosh was it ever worth it!Of all the heroines I've ever read, Lily was most certainly one of the ones I admired the most. I knew loved her from the first few pages, but having finished the book, I truly couldn't be prouder of her. Her strength and conviction over the course of this story made her into a heroine I'd want every girl and woman to read about and look up to. She was so real and vulnerable as we all are, but the strength with which she took control of her life was admirable on such a deep level. I just wanted to hug her and cheer. I don't think I've been this proud of a fictional character before.There's an incrediblypowerful messagein this book that is very subtly woven in from the start. It begins in the first chapter, but you don't yet realize howsignificanteach of these moments truly are... and as you read more, these pieces of the story come together forming a scenario that gives such a raw, honest portrayal of an incredibly relevant issue. I'm not mentioning it on purpose because I don't want you to expect it.The fact that it's unexpected for you as the reader is very important because it's also unexpected for the heroine.As she begins to realize what kind of situation she's in, so do you. And this realization very much allows you to experience her journeywithher.The only thing I want to address head on is the question of the 'love triangle' because a few of you have read the blurb and have asked about it. All I want to say is to please try and move away from that thought. I don't want to spoil the plot at all, but that is so not what this book is about. That is not the point, or the focus. Whatever it is you're thinking this book is, just trust me -- it's so much bigger than that. Seriously, trust Colleen. I did.As a romance reader, I found this book incredibly refreshing. As much as I adore the romance genre (and I really do), it sometimes can get a little repetative. As both an avid reader and a blogger, I'm always looking for books that step outside the lines a little; ones that do something different or take the issues a little deeper. This book represented exactly what I wish I could be reading all the time -- not this literal story, but just the fact that it went in such a different direction and gave me such an unexpected story that left me with such a strong message.One of the things that intrigued me the most and had me wondering when I heard about this book was what the title really meant -- and there's this very specific moment when the title is echoed in the story that just had such astrongimpact as I read it. That was my cheer moment. I just sat back and went 'woah!'. The title is truly perfect.In order to write this review, I went back over the book a second time and one thing I noticed strongly was how many intricate layers there were to the story that I couldn't possibly have known about in my first read. I loved that this is one of those books you experience differently (in a good way) both the first and second time though.I have to say that this book would make aseriously amazing movie. I could picture every scene so clearly as I read. This is also such an incredibly relevant story for many people -- whether they've personally been through what happened to Lily or they know of someone who has -- so I really do hope that one day this makes it to the big screen.My copy of this book is literally filled with highlighted quotes in every single chapter but I made a conscious decision not to add any to this review because I really truly do not want to give anything away about the story. Just trust me and jump into this story blind. I promise that it is a reading experience you don't want to miss.This began as one of my most highly anticipated books of 2016 and it is now of my top favorite books of the year. I was unable to put it down from the moment I started reading and I know that this is one of those profoundly beautiful and unforgettable stories that will stay with me for a long time. I highly recommend it toeveryone!That’s what fifteen minutes can do to a person. It can destroy them.It can save them.Rating: 5+ STARS!

My name is Kelly . . . .Also, I spoil things, so back away quickly if you don’t want this one to be ruined for you.My glaring 1 Star in a sea of 5s probably makes it pretty clear that I detested this book, but please refrain from fetching your torches and pitchforks for a moment and take note that not only did Ijust 5 Star a CoHo Story two weeks ago(as well as shoved it down everyone’s throats I possibly could), but also I want to make all of the sexuals with Miles Archer and will fight anyone for dibs on his imaginary lurv making. I didn’t pick this up in order to hate on it. I’m one of you . . . . sometimes. Definitely not this time, but lots of times. And this is why I don’t ever give up on Hoover novels. I never know how I’m going to react.Allow me to explain what went wrong for me with this one . . .Let’s start with the obvious annoyances that seem to be in nearly every NA book that drive me batshit before getting to the real nitty gritty. First, the character names. Ryle, Lily Bloom and Atlas???????Is it against the law tonotuse absolutely ridiculous (™Ron2.0) names in these books????Second . . . .“Your lips. I love how they’re as red as your hair.”According to Google (all hail Google) less than 2% of the world’s population has red hair, and yet 99.998% of all NA leading ladies do. Just stahp.Third, non-existent chemistry. In this story Lily and Ryle meet by chance on a rooftop after experiencing respective miserable days. In a matter of minutes Lily goes from worrying the stranger on the roof could be a psycho killer/rapist to getting into his super sexy (NOT) pick-up lines . . .“If you wouldn’t sleep with someone you just met . . .” His eyes meet mine again. “Exactly how far would you go?”Ewww. She already said thanks but no thanks freakshow so STFU.Now let’s move on to the real big issue. I took a gander at my friends’ reviews before I started typing this and noticed my buddyChelseawas the only other naysayer in the batch. She summed it upperfectlywhen she talked about the massive amounts of emotional manipulation that was forced down the readers’ throats in order to make them feel all the things.It’s a running joke with my friends/family/co-workers that I have a robot heart. And for the majority of the time it’s true. I generally experience two emotions – happiness and annoyance. But even a robot like me can be manipulated into having a feeling/crying the ugly tears like a Kardashian once in a blue moon (*coughMe Before Youcough*). This time, though? It was like a flashing neon sign . . . .To begin with, our first leading male Atlas is a homeless teenager who Lily befriends/eventually loses her virginity. In case you don’t get the writing on the wall, Atlas is being set up as the most perfect perfection that ever perfected. He’s also the way to getting the “raised in an abusive household” plotline uncovered. Like in all NA stories, Atlas and Lily are torn apart. Lily moves on with her life, graduates college, yada yada, and, as mentioned above, meet-cutessuper creeperMr. Right 2.0 on the roof. Mr. Right 2.0 is not only another most perfect perfection that ever perfected, but he’s alsorichand aneurosurgeonand very obviously husband material even though he’s never had a girlfriend (also after dating only six months),annnnnnnnddue to their mutually busy schedules not really knowing the guy.It wasn’t too hard to see where the story was going to go (and no, I hadn’t been spoiled because I didn’t read any reviews or the synopsis, I just auto-request everything by Hoover from both NetGalley and the library). Basically this was a story about domestic abuse and making excuses not only the first time he knocks your ass down “on accident” but also the second time when you wake up after “falling” down the stairs and hearing his sob story about a superbadawful that effed him up as a kid and then agreeing on a policy where“When you’re upset, just walk away. And I’ll walk away”(becauseTHAT’Sgoing to fucking work) and then saying“It’s okay, Ryle. It’s okay. You were angry, it’s okay”and making sure even when you’re bleeding profusely out of your fucking skull and are concussed and have quite possibly just been raped by your own damn husband that you get taken to an emergency room in a hospital other than the one where your bastard abuser works in order to protect his ass as well as explaining“sometimes the reason women go back is simply because they’re in love”and in case all that wasn’t e-fucking-nough you add in a whoopsie baby (another NA per usual) to serve as the wake-up call that maybe it’d be a good idea to ditch this zero and eventually find you a hero,buuuuuuuuuuuutyou just come to an agreement regarding visitation and whathaveyou rather than involving the court and much needed supervised interaction because youknowhe wouldn’t hurt the baby since it’s obvious he loves her . . . .Nope.I’m well aware I’m going against the grain here. I give zero fucks. Don’t bother trolling me to tell me how stupid I am (especially if you’re a teenager who has lived a privileged lifestyle and never experienced anything contained in this book for yourself).

Reading this book will change your life. It’s so different from any of Colleen Hoover’s other books. You can tell it’s heavier, more personal, just more. This book is deep. It’s profound. It’s a book that needs to be read. I'll repeat:THIS IS A BOOK THAT NEEDS TO BE READ!This story is moving. It will make you think about things that are uncomfortable to think about. It will lift your heart, devastate you at times, make you proud, fill you with sorrow and make you smile. It will move you. It’s powerful and intense in the best way, but also has hopeful and lighter moments. The story itself is one that has been heavy on my heart from the moment I finished it.Sometimes, I read a book and it’s so beautiful, influential and emotional I will cry just thinking about the characters and their story. Not in a bad way necessarily, I just get that moved and that emotional while thinking about it. That is this book. Trying to find the words for this review is bringing me to tears. It’s hard to explain the story completely spoiler free, but this isn’t a ‘sad’ book. It’s a strength book. Because dealing with the issues in this story took so much strength.I’m not going to talk about the actual story at all, but I will speak a bit about the characters.Lily. Speaking of strength, Lily may be the strongest heroine that I’ve read about. Your strength is really tested when you are put in a hard situation where your choices are impossible. I loved Lily so much. I was proud of Lily and the choices she made. I want to be Lily when I grow up.Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we’ll never get back.There are two men in this story, but please don’t think this is a triangle book. It’s not. It’s hard to explain, but it’s not.Ryleis a charming guy. He’s a giving person. He’s got a lot of great attributes. I’m not sure if I’ve ever felt so conflicted over a character as I did him.Atlasis the type of man I always have a soft spot for as a reader. His story gutted me at times, but he is also a character with a lot of strength and so much beauty. I loved Atlas from the second I met him and that love never stopped throughout the book.“Lily?” he whispers, looking at me sincerely. “You just might be the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”Aside from the three main characters in the story, Lily’s mom played a prominent part. Their relationship played an even bigger part. Ryle’s sister and Lily’s best friend Alyssa was one of my favorite characters in this book. When things got hard she was there. One line she said in the book, to Lily just solidified the type of woman she was. Coleen always writes that one side character that you love so hard in her stories, and Alyssa was that character for me. I can’t not mention Ellen, because, well, it’s Ellen. That part was brilliant. It made me smile every time Ellen was mentioned.When reading this book, there were moments I struggled between not being able to tear my eyes away from the page, and others I had to take a breather because I couldn't handle what was going on.Parts of this story left me so heartbroken and others lifted me up so high. There are some parts that are just so powerful I could only read them in awe. This is it. This is why I read. Books like this.All humans make mistakes. What determines a person’s character aren’t the mistakes we make. It’s how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses.Colleen Hoover is an author who truly has a way with words. She killed this book. I’ve read and loved all of CoHo’s books. Some of her earlier books are some of my all-time favorites. I’ve enjoyed all of her latest books, but this is by far the best book she’s ever written. And it’s tied withHopelessas my own personal favorite book by her. And that is saying a lot, becauseHopelessis one of my top books ever.If you only read one book this year, let it beIt Ends with Us. Everyone needs to read this book. 5+ star favorite. Completely unforgettable and highly recommended!“It stops here. With me and you. It ends with us.”""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I honestly don't know how I feel.There are times I amangryand times I amsad. And then I'm both. And it's the worst, because there is a war raging inside me, and the winner side keeps changing. How is it possible to switch from denial to sorrow to fury to acceptance in a heartbeat?“There is no such thing as bad people. We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.”I did my best not to cry. I felt sick, but I clenched my jaw and forced myself to keep reading, trying in vain to ignore the tremors that ran through my body. But when the last chapters came, and Colleen's note in the end, I couldn't take it any more. I dissolved into angry, hot tears, and I checked my chest to make sure my heart was not bleeding. Lily's story had a lot to teach. I think I died a little when I realized that sometimeslove is not enough. Regret, good will, they're not enough to fix some wounds. On the contrary, they make them deeper.“Just because someone hurts you doesn't mean you can simply stop loving them. It's not a person's actions that hurt the most. It's the love. If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear.”It Ends with Usis the most personal and daring and painful bookColleen Hooverhas ever written. Abuseanddomestic violenceare a delicate subject, and when I found out they were this book's main theme I thought about not reading it. It was a moment of cowardice, a moment I didn't want to witness this side of relationships. But I owed it to myself, as a person and as a woman to proceed. Because pretending a problem doesn't exist does not make it disappear. There will bespoilersbelow so if you haven't readIt Ends with Us, you should probably stop here.“Fifteen seconds.

Why does she let her fear guide her, and she's so selfish that makes her children witness such horrors inside their home, that was supposed to be their sanctuary?But what we should ask iswhat is wrong withhim?Instead of making excuses and trying to justify him, we should take a moment and consider how she feels, and the difficult decisions she has to make.Ryle broke my heart into millions of pieces.I fell in love with him, and I kept wishing that Colleen would delete these words, these scenes that hurt me and disappointed me and shattered my belief in happy endings. A part of me, a part I tried to smother, a part I am ashamed that exists, wanted him to change. To try harder, and for Lily to let him try harder. Me, who judged them for not leaving. In the end,I felt sorry for Ryle. For losing the love of his life, for destroying his only chance at happiness. I don't forgive him, I just wish that a magic wand would make everything better.“So much gravity, pushing down on my emotions. Everything shatters.My tears, my heart, my laughter, my soul. Shattered like broken glass, raining down around me.”Lily is a hero.She haddignity, andcourageandstrength. At first I was judging her mother for staying, but witnessing through Lily's eyes her challenges, feeling her heartbreak and her dilemmas, made me regret all the ugly things I thought. Loving the person who hurts you is a greater torture than the physical act itself. And damn it I loved Ryle, and I hated Colleen for that.I hated her for making me swoon and laugh when she was about to shatter my soul.The Katerina that startedIt Ends with Usis a different person than the Katerina that finished it. Remorseful, destroyed, wiser.“Life is a funny thing. We only get so many years to live it, so we have to do everything we can to make sure those years are as full as they can be. We shouldn't waste time on things that might happen someday, or maybe even never.”A part of me wants to forget thisraw, powerful, inspirational, beautiful and ugly book.

When I re-read this in prep for the new one and then diving right in to it, I feel the need to change this rating to a 2. However, I will be leaving my original review up.It Ends With Us... Wow I really don\'t know what to truly say about this novel. This review will be a little light because, like most CoHo books, you\'ll want to go into it with little to no information. I went into this book thinking it was going to be this one thing, and it turned out to be the complete opposite.IEWUfollows Lily, a girl in her early twenties, who has never had it easy. Though coming from a family that was better off she has always had to work for the things she\'s wanted. After graduating college she gets up and moves to Boston and hopes to start her own business. While there she meets and falls for Ryle, a thriving neurosurgeon who is determined to be the best in his field. The two hit it off hard, and things seem almost too good to be true. Ryle is everything that Lily is not. He is forward, assertive, and stubborn. He is also a lot of thing Lily is; he is strong, passionate, and motivated. Though the two have an immediate connections and sparks fly, the two decided to take their time getting to know one another. Lily is such a beautifully written leading lady. I loved getting to grow with her and be apart of her journey. I loved hearing her thoughts and seeing how she processed things. When I was first reading and got to the point where she does her journal entries, but she does them so they are letters to Ellen DeGeneres, I thought I wasn\'t going to like that aspect of it. The first few had me thinking ""this is a little cheesy"", but the more I got into it the more I started to enjoy them. They really tied Lily\'s past and present perfectly together. As Lily\'s and Ryle\'s relationship pushes forward she finds herself looking back at those entries and thoughts of her first love Atlas resurface. Atlas was her first everything and was the biggest impact on her life. Atlas was the homeless boy who found his way into the abandoned house next door. Atlas and Lily as teens formed an unlikely friendship. Sharing everything and having a bond that no one around them seemed to understand. Spending every possible moment together and having so many stolen ones the two were kindred spirits. When Atlas reappears in the story it truly threatens everything Lily and Ryle have. (not a spoiler it\'s given he eventually will). Both Ryle and Atlas bring such important and different aspects to this story. I think CoHo manages to make them both such polar opposites, but at the same time manages to make them mesh so well.The characters in the book, main or side, all feel so realistic and authentic.When it comes to the plot there is almost nothing I can say about it. I hope everyone will do the same to keep things from getting spoiled. The story is an emotional roller coaster from start to finish. It\'s one of those books that you will have a thousand theories about and all of them will be wrong. I kept trying to guess what I thought might happen next and in classic Hoover style she managed to surprise me. This book was solid from page one and was steady throughout, but around the 80% mark is where things really took a turn (in the best way possible).IEWUhit me on such a personal level. I didn\'t expect this book to impact me so hard. It had everything I wanted from a New Adult read. It\'s very classic CoHo, but it also branches out somewhere she\'s never been before, but she does it with such ease. She manages to weave these heavy moments with ones that will make you swoon, laugh, and then cry. My favorite part of this book though, was the author\'s note. Usually author\'s notes are at the beginning of the story, however it is so important that this one was left for the end. It took a book that was good and made it exceptional! God, this note effected me like so few books have. It made me cry fifty times harder than the entire book or anything Colleen\'s ever written.Finding out how important this book was for her to write will hit you hard, but I hope she also knows how important it is as a reader to read. Knowing where an author gets their ideas from can change your whole outlook on a book, and this one... this one broke me.Thank you Colleen Hoover for continuing to gift the reading community with your words.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Dear Colleen,I find it fitting that I write this review as a letter to you the way Lily would write to Ellen. Don\'t ask me why, I really don\'t know. What I do know is that I haven\'t been on Goodreads in nearly six months and it\'s entirely your fault that i\'m here now. So, if i stumble upon a poor review on one of my books and end up in the fetal position on my kitchen floor surrounded by Ding Dong wrappers, well, I\'m blaming it on you. I\'ve even given my husband instructions to bill you for the psychiatry bill if that happens.On Friday I had a hysterectomy. It wasn\'t the worst day of my life, but it certainly wasn\'t the best. One chapter of my life--quite possibly the best chapter--ended. The surgery itself took twenty minutes. Twenty minutes. Can you believe that? Twenty minutes to take out the uterus that carried my three beautiful babies for a total of twenty eight months. Twenty minutes to change my life. Don\'t feel bad for me, that\'s not what I want. The offending organ had to come out, I knew this. But it didn\'t make it any easier. It didn\'t make the finality of the situation any easier. In all honesty, for a couple of minutes I didn\'t just feel like a chapter was ending, more like an entire flipping book. Maybe my life isn\'t made up of chapters, maybe it\'s part of a duet, or a trilogy? Either way, part of my story was over.Over a matter of several hours, I slowly woke up from surgery and at one point I remember sitting there and just staring at the wall paper in my hospital room.My uterus was gone.Mauve diamonds.The wallpaper was covered in mauve diamonds.That\'s the most hideous color, don\'t you think? Mauve. Not quite pink. Not quite maroon.I counted seven hundred and fifty three diamonds before I allowed the first tear to fall. But I wasn\'t just crying for losing a part of my body, and I wasn\'t crying for losing the ability to carry more children. I was crying because some women don\'t even get to experience what I\'ve gotten to experience. Some women never get to have babies. They never get to feel them grow in their bellies. They never get to see the slimy little monsters as they tumble their way into this world.And I did.I got to do all of that three times.So why was I so upset? What the hell was my problem? I should be grateful, right? Happy?My husband slept soundly in the chair, snoring softly, but at some point my cries must have woken him up. He stirred and I did the only thing I could do ... I grabbed your book. You see, it was sitting on my bedside table. I buried my nose between the pages and when my better half asked me if I was okay I simply peeked over the top of the book and whispered, ""Colleen. She did it again.""I didn\'t need to say much more, he knows my obsession with your words and I found myself grateful. Grateful that he knew your books make me cry and grateful that you inadvertently allowed me to grieve. And that\'s what I did. I read your book and I grieved. I cried when Lily cried. I cried when Ryle cried. And even when no one was crying, I still cried simply because I needed to and I could and no one thought twice about it because i was reading and that\'s what i do when i read. It was my outlet, my excuse for the tears that wouldn\'t go away, the tears that kept falling despite my desperate protest.I cried for all of the Lily\'s in the world, and the Ryle\'s too. I cried for the Atlas\'. And I cried for the Kirby\'s (that\'s my name. No i\'m not named after a vacuum, or a cream puff)But you see, I didn\'t want to cry. I didn\'t want to be upset. I have three beautiful children whom I love with my entire heart. My body did it\'s job extremely well and that is something to be proud of. But why wasn\'t I proud?Naked truth?I\'m selfish.I wanted one more baby even though my husband didn\'t. I wanted one more baby when there are women out there that can\'t have any at all.So why am I telling you this? My story is nothing like Lily\'s. Not even close.But maybe it is ...She wanted something she shouldn\'t want. I wanted something I couldn\'t have. She had a decision to make ... one that would change her life. So did I. She made a decision that was right for her and for her life at that particular time.Ditto.But the real reason I\'m telling you this is because for two days I was drowning and It Ends With Us was my lifeline. It\'s what I grabbed when I needed to stop thinking ... it\'s what I grabbed when i needed to cry ... and when i finally finished the book and put it down, it wasn\'t mauve diamonds that I saw ... it was my smiling children.My three beautiful smiling children ... and my niece Lily.-- Kirby'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '""We all have a limit. What we\'re willing to put up with before we break.""When was the last time a book just completely slayed me, cutting me so deep and evoking such strong emotions? It feels like my heart has been filled, then broken, filled, then broken. In the end, I\'m stunned by what I read.It Ends with Usstarts out innocently enough. We follow the courtship of Lily and Ryle. He is handsome, successful, and so thoroughly smitten with Lily he can barely think. He makes advances while claiming he doesn\'t do relationships. She rebuffs him while secretly pining for him. Really, it\'s all fun and a bit frivolous, your standard romance.But then we arrive at the crux of this story, which I\'ll try my best to be vague here so as to minimize the spoilage. (Though at this point, with all the hubbub surrounding the movie, I\'d be surprised if there is anyone out there who doesn\'t yet know what this is about.) Nonetheless, it\'s best to read it from Colleen Hoover\'s own words, and what an astounding set of words they are.Make no mistake, this isn\'t a romance even though it starts out as one. Instead, it\'s a considerably more honest look at relationships—their ups and downs, and what really happens when the rosy tint wears off and it turns out one person has bigger issues than the relationship can contain. As a result, it asks us readers the very uncomfortable question of just how much we are willing to put up with for love.I will say, the main topic in here is something that a lot of books try to tackle, but very few do right. Often books will go heavy-handed in making one character out to be the villain, as if afraid that a more subtle approach will somehow be misconstrued as condonement. But this does a disservice to the entire situation, making it difficult for us to understand the other character\'s perspective as well as their reasons for being in the relationship in the first place.What makes Hoover\'s portrayal so masterful is her nuanced approach. She brings a humanity to both sides that is sobering and heartbreaking, and it makes the whole thing ring true. It\'s brutal and compelling, and it\'s hard to look away.I think for those of us fortunate enough to never have been in a situation like this, it\'s easy to take the ideal road and turn our noses up at anything less than the puritanical view. But real life isn\'t like that at all; it isn\'t black and white. It\'s filled to the brim with all sorts of gray, day in and day out. And Hoover shades in the gray with a skillfulness that is so raw and visceral, it often made me forget where my lines are.Many people think that Hoover is romanticizing what is going on in here, but that isn\'t it at all. In making Ryle the complex person that he is with good qualities, and in making Ryle and Lily\'s relationship happy most of the time, Hoover actually manages to explain the most confounding paradox of abusive relationships—that they are good or even great most of the time, and that the victim is neither too dumb to realize they\'re being mistreated nor are they too lazy to affect change. But rather, the victim needs to be exceptionally strong and well-supported in order to leave behind so many good moments in order to cut out a few bad ones.I read this book years ago when it first came out, and I remember thinking highly of it, though not much else. So when I read it again this time, I admit I was shaken by how hard it hit me. I think it\'s because I\'m older now and have more experience with love and relationships, so I\'m able to appreciate this story even more.My suggestions if you\'re going to read this book—have a box of tissues ready and don\'t skip the author\'s note at the end. I sobbed my way to the finishing line, then read the author\'s note and sobbed some more. This is a riveting and worthwhile read, though at times difficult, and it showcases Colleen Hoover at her best, taking her contemporary new adult genre and elevating it to soaring heights.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:It Starts with UsVerityReminders of HimRegretting YouUgly LoveLayla~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Preventing your heart from forgiving someone you love is actually a hell of a lot harder than simply forgiving them.4 1/2 stars.Holy crap, what a book.This is unlike anything Hoover has written before. I have so many emotions right now that it\'s hard to know where to start, but I think everyone should read this book. That\'s right: everyone.I could easily give everything away. I could, but I won\'t. If you go looking for lots of reviews, it won\'t be hard to work out whatIt Ends with Usis about. And if you do, you should still read it, but I think it\'s better if you don\'t. I think you should go into this book knowing as little as possible. Just realize that this is something very different from Hoover\'s usual new adult romances (that I admittedly have hadallkindsofproblemswith).So I don\'t want to say too much, but this is anextremely powerful storyand it\'s not what most people will be expecting. It gets its power from the singular first person narrative (I\'m honestly not a big fan of the alternating male/female POV romances) and we experience everything through Lily\'s eyes. When she falls in love, we fall in love; when her heart is broken, our heart is broken; when she gets it all wrong, so do we.I cannot stress how important anddamn smartthis book is. There is no black and white characterization - it\'s much deeper and more complex than that, and therefore, far more emotional.It peels back the layers of characters and relationships to do something that so many other authors have tried and failed to do - to make you understand a situation that for most people makes no sense. It\'svery sad, painful and exceptionally honest. My heart hurt while reading it and I almost cried several times.As well as all this emotion and sadness that I\'m being coy about, Hoover also brings out some of her very best writing. Little gems of honesty about human nature and relationships that are all the more painful because of their resounding truth. It\'s such a quotable book, but unfortunately most of the quotes are spoilers, so I shall refrain from posting them.There\'s so many great things to mention, but I keep getting distracted by myfeelings. The narrative is interspersed with letters that Lily wrote as a teenager and they are addressed to Ellen Degeneres - a strange touch that ends up being absolutely perfect. Shit, just writing this review and remembering the story is an emotional experience.And then there\'s theabsolutely fantastic female friendship. I want Allysa to be my best friend. Hoover clearly knows her audience of 16-25 year old women, creating characters with their quirks and habits - Allysa, for example, is a self-confessed ""Pinterest whore"", which made me laugh. But seriously, she is the best friend ever and she says one of the most perfect lines in this book.Anyway, I\'m just going to start rambling soon because I read this book in a whirlwind of emotions throughout a single day. I\'ve been up since a ridiculous time and I need to go sleep now. But really, give this book a chance. I thought it was excellent.Trigger Warnings:Domestic abuse (physical, occasionally graphic). Attempted rape.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube|Store'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '""I want you so, so bad, and I swear, once you have sex with me, you\'ll never hear from me again. I promise.""I\'m convinced anyone who gives this five stars is not sane. It contains the typical ~ I don\'t do marriage~ love interest, but somehow, he magically wants a committed relationship and kids with our lucky lady after a few interactions. We love being the only exception. It ends with us contains a lot of dark elements such as abuse, toxic relationships, and attempted rape. I understand this novel is based on the author\'s experience, but that doesn\'t mean it\'s good, nor am I obligated to like it. There\'s absolutely no justification for abuse, and why Lily continues to stay is beyond my comprehension. Throwing away your morals just because someone is hot has got to be the stupidest thing ever.The author added numerous poor book decisions; I\'ll list some of them here:1) The main character\'s full name is Lily Blossom Bloom, and she runs a florist shop. Do I need to say more?2) Lily is obsessed with Ellen Degeneres to the point where Ellen becomes the 4th main character of the story.3) Ryle knocked on 29 apartment doors simply to find Lily and proceeded to beg on his knees for her to fuck him.4) Lily\'s bedroom light turned on at the exact perfect moment, just as Atlas was about to commit suicide. Wow, what a mere coincidence. He thought she was an angel beaming in the light. He said, and I quote""I ~felt~ something,""that\'s the reason why he didn\'t want to kill himself anymore.5) Every repetitive""just keep swimming""reference.6) Ryle put a big picture of Lily on his wall after their first meeting. Was this supposed to be attractive?7) The typical let\'s invite my gay best friend as my date to make Ryle jealous, only for the gay best friend never to reappear again. I smell a plot device.8) This quote >>""There\'s no such thing as bad people, just people who do bad things.""9) Atlas slept with 16-year-old Lily when he was a legal adult.10) Lily names her daughter Dory after the fish in Finding Nemo.11) Colleen Hoover has the most unhinged sentences:""When he was wiping that cow shit on me, it was quite possibly the most turned-on I have ever been.""I do, however, understand the valuable and worthwhile message it sends. It\'s difficult to leave someone you love in such situations, which are never black and white. It is so hard that you come up with excuses and can even make the truth sound like made-up lies. I previously stated that I couldn\'t understand why Lily never left Ryle after the first incident of assault happened. It contradicts what I said just now about the author\'s message, but that\'s because I\'ve never understood their chemistry. Lily said she couldn\'t leave because she loved him too much, which was strange. It was merely a case of physical attraction. There\'s also no reason for the author to randomly throw a bunch of serious topics (homelessness, guilt, infertility, abuse, suicidal thoughts) just for the sake of making the book forcefully emotional and not going more in-depth about them. Furthermore, I was not too fond of the plot and didn\'t connect with a single character. I don\'t understand why Ryle didn\'t get help, especially when he could do things similar to their daughter or another partner. That man better stay the hell away from me, or I will seal him up in a trash bag and hit him to the moon with a baseball bat. In conclusion, I will never touch another Colleen Hoover book.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'My additional thoughts on the book adaptation and my movie review:I love Colleen Hoover so much, I’d probably even read her shopping list if she published it—her perfect blend of angst and tear-jerking emotion always gets me! I also really enjoyed the movie—the performances were strong, the emotional depth was moving, and the powerful, liberating message against domestic violence truly resonated with me.However, I can’t stand the ongoing feud between the lead actors. It needs to end! They need to make peace, especially with the It Starts with Us sequel coming up. It’s time to put the drama behind them and focus on what’s next for the fans.Here are my thoughts on the movie:https://medium.com/@niluferyozmekik/i...———————-Oh my! Argh! This is me confronting my ripped apart heart pieces after reading this book! Actually, I read the book a long time ago. I was too scared to write a review because writing meant opening up about my feelings. This book hurt me a lot, and I couldn’t find the right words to describe the “hurt” it gave me.Honestly, this is my longest Coelho reading because I put it down several times. I got pissed! I screamed! I clenched my fists so hard! I cursed the entire family tree of Ryle Kinkaid! I haven’t wanted to hire contract torturers to kidnap a character and give them the punishment they deserved for so long.The things he did to Lily—the physical and emotional abuse—were impossible for me to absorb. I felt breathless and gave up several times. This book sledgehammered my heart and crushed my soul!I returned to my reading because the beautiful love story between Atlas and Lily was like seeing sunshine through dark clouds, giving me the only hope I could hold onto. I honestly thought of only reading the flashbacks to warm my heart!What if they had reconnected that night when they accidentally met again at the restaurant? What if Lily had gone back to him instead of choosing a path with Ryle? That scenario made me so happy, but it would never be the same without the tremendous angst Coelho threw at us because she is an expert at bringing out the dirtiest, ugliest cries of regular human beings! And without pain and suffering, so much sadness, we don’t feel like we’re reading an actual Coelho story, do we? Never!This book is being developed into a screenplay! It’s so compelling to read this heart-stabbing, soul-sledgehammering story without consuming tons of paper products to dry the tears we may shed. I cannot imagine how the movie will affect me. But sometimes words hurt more than actions, and I’m sure no screenwriter has the ability to reflect all the emotions Coelho made us feel during our reads.So my advice: stock up on all the paper products from grocery stores, lock yourself in a soundproof room so as not to scare your neighbors with your screams and howling sounds, and give your entire concentration to this lyrical, insanely heartfelt story.It’s one of the most compelling, sad, and sensational Coelho books. I could hardly digest the emotional turmoil it gave me! But it’s worth the pain. Especially that meaningful, sentimental, poetic ending melted my heart.I made some adjustments for clarity and flow, while preserving the original emotions and tone.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'I don’t believe in disliking things just because they are popular. I went into this with the intention of liking it, but ended up feeling uncomfortable by the tone of this book. Although I wholeheartedly respect the personal nature of this story, the author’s note does not exempt this work of fiction from criticism, especially when it comes to a topic as serious as domestic abuse.I empathize with the main character Lily and I appreciate the effort that was made to highlight how trauma distorts and lingers, but I don’t believe this captured the severity or nuance that a topic this heavy deserves in fictionalized work. This book is marketed as romance, and the synopsis makes it seem like a lighthearted love triangle instead of a woman’s experience with spousal abuse. In comparison to Kate Elizabeth Russell’s harrowing depiction of abuse inMy Dark Vanessa, the tone ofIt Ends With Usfeels acutely inappropriate. It reduces domestic abuse to a lovers quarrel and presents a tactless caricature of the realities of abuse. I can acknowledge this may not have been the intention, but the elaboration in the authors note does not absolve this book of its reckless and irresponsible marketing.It Ends With Ushas the bones of a powerful story but reads like a low budget Hallmark movie pushed forward by ridiculous plot revelations. Hoover’s attempt to make Ryle into a three dimensional character completely flops. At first, I thought the accelerated relationship between Ryle and Lily was meant to emphasize how witnessing abuse in early age might make you less likely to spot red flags in others; however, it turns out Hoover was really trying to create a deep relationship between these two. Her use of “Naked Truth” to build their relationship was a lazy ploy to circumvent true development and simulated an unsatisfying and unearned intimacy. I also found the use of teenage diary entries in the form of letters to Ellen DeGeneres to have aged really badly, and comes off as a corny device to tell rather than show readers about Lily’s relationship with Atlas.The single redeeming quality of this book is the empathy that Lily develops for her mother towards the end, but this moment, as well as the ending, lacks sufficient nuance. I wanted more discussion, I wanted more development, and I wanted less telling and more showing. Although the message that the cycle of abuse “ends with us” is personal for Hoover, I feel like this depiction is reductive and makes it seem like walking away is a choice all women have. Hoover maintains that this book was meant to show that domestic abuse isn’t black and white, but I don’t think it achieved that at all. She made the conscious decision to pit romance and abuse against each other, packaged it with a pink cover, a synopsis free of any mention of abuse, and marketed it to impressionable young adults. However well intentioned this cathartic passion project was, its reception as a work of fiction is devout of nuance, the white knight message ofIt Ends With Uscompletely undercut by its blatant romanticism of abuse.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""this book sends a really important and worthwhile message, but it's not necessarily enjoyable.IT ENDS WITH US was not what i expected it to be. i started the novel knowing next to nothing about the storyline except that it's a colleen hoover book (NA romance) and that it'sgood(my friends kept raving). but if i'm being honest, i wasa little disappointed.i was hoping for a light read with lots of ~FEELZ~ but instead i got something much more intense – not bad, just unexpected.the main plot revolves around abusive and toxic relationships within families. it really opened my eyes to the emotions of those in these types of situations and helped me gain a lot of perspective. because of this, i think it's important to read this, but it's not enjoyable. it's definitely a really frustrating process to read.for the majority of this novel, i DIDN'T like it. i was definitely interested and curious, but i didn't care for the characters as much as i thought i would. i was frustrated and annoyed at the situations, and some of it felt artificial, rushed, and stereotypical. it all seemed so... fictional. usually the romance satisfies me, but even that didn't do it. buuuuuut it wasn't so much that i didn't NOT like it. it was simply okay when i expected it to be ~amazing~.there were two romantic tropes that bothered me because i don't like the tropes themselves and because i didn't think it was executed THAT well: insta-love and love triangle.ryle was too good to be true; a hot, young, smart, compassionate, arrogant, sensitive, rich guy suddenly appears and falls head over heels for our main character. they – somehow!! – meet again and this time he's literally BEGGING to have sex with her. suddenly, this fuckboi wants to be in a committed relationship and plans on having kids with our lucky lady. um......... okay????? i didn't feel anything for their relationship and ryle seemed like a plot device to me. and when she didn't leave him the first time, i knew i KNEW he would do much worse again. and i didn't feel surprised when it happened; i didn't feel surprised when she asked for the divorce – a little relieved maybe, but not surprised.then there's atlas, who i felt had more depth than ryle and lily but also not thaaaat much. he was probably my favorite character, but i felt his story (the letters) were kinda.. anti-climactic? their relationship was confusing to decipher, but i still loved them. it made me sad to think lily didn't end up with atlas IN THE FIRST PLACE but i guess that would make the whole purpose of the book redundant.even though i didn't enjoy the process of reading this book, i'm grateful to have read it. there are some books you read for pleasure and there are some you read to gain knowledge and perspective. this is the latter.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Phenomenal!This book will make you fall in love, rip your heart out and force you to reconsider your preconceived ideas about abuse.

It's one that'll hang with you. In so many ways, her story gutted me. Yet, it was also inspiring.Lily grows up in an abusive household.

She grows into a strong and independent woman, leaving behind the horrors of her childhood...Or so she thinks.Despite everything she's promised herself, Lily finds herself in an abusive relationship. The behavior and cycle is so insidious that you almost can't believe what is happening. Ms. Hoover manages to weave the violence into a relationship that is otherwise seemingly perfect.

The Silent Patient
",Alex Michaelides,4.18,2590183,285116,"Thriller, Mystery, Fiction, Mystery Thriller, Suspense, Crime, Psychological Thriller",336,05-02-2019,"Alicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect. A famous painter married to an in-demand fashion photographer, she lives in a grand house with big windows overlooking a park in one of London’s most desirable areas. One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word.Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The price of her art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and spotlight at the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London.Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a twisting path into his own motivations—a search for the truth that threatens to consume him....The Silent Patientis a shocking psychological thriller of a woman’s act of violence against her husband—and of the therapist obsessed with uncovering her motive.","[{'rating': 1, 'content': '| |blog|tumblr|ko-fi| |“Please don’t let’s get dramatic.”I\'ve been a bithesitantabout writing this review since the majority of readers really enjoyed this debut. Howeversince Goodreads allows us toexpressandrespectour different opinions I don\'t see any harm in being honest.I didn\'t hateThe Silent Patientbut I did find thisnovelboth ridiculous and incompetent.Just becauseThe Silent Patienthas a ""twist"" that doesn\'t mean it should be labelled as being a psychological thriller. There is little to no suspense, the mystery is laughable, the tension largely MIA. Thepsychologyin this one is...well,the depiction of psychiatrist and psychotherapists is at best, laughable, at worst, ignorant.The book hinges completely on its ""twist"", a twist thatalso renders the majority of the narrativecompletely irrelevant.This book seems to meyet anotherweak attempt of jumping on the domestic thriller bandwagon.In short:Calling this a novel seems somewhat misleading. This reads more like some sort ofhackneyedscript.LONG REVIEW AHEAD (if you enjoyed this book I advise you to skip this rant-review)The Silent Patientis a really flawed piece of work. I will try to tackle what I personally thought were the major problems this book had (and yes, this is my subjective opinion):✎THE WRITING(idiotic dialogues + inane monologues + ham-handed metamorphoses + a complete lack of a sense of place)✖ I likeAgatha Christieand she has what I would call a \'dry\' style of writing. Her mysteries are heavy on dialogue. The many conversations that her characters have are witty, amusing and or entertaining. The descriptions she provides perfectly render the characters\' mannerisms and surroundings.Michaelides\' writing mostly consisted in a series of dialogues between two characters and itreads like a script. It would work if what they spoke like actual peoplerather than this:“Perhaps I’m imagining it.But I’m sensing something… Keep an eye on it. Any aggression or competitiveness interferes with the work.You two need to work with each other, not against each other.”“But remember, with greater feeling comes greater danger.”The dialogues/monologuescame across as being incredibly silly and they make the characters sound like children.✖ There wereplenty of dramatic and over-the-top statements and or phrases that really ruinedpotentiallysignificant scenesand or somber moments of contemplation:“Her silence was like a mirror—reflecting yourself back at you.”~“Now I saw the truth.[She] hadn’t saved me—she wasn’t capable of saving anyone. She was no heroine to be admired—just a frightened, fucked-up girl, a cheating liar. This whole mythology ofusthat I had built up […] now collapsed in seconds—like a house of cards in a gust of wind.”~“How was this possible?Had she been acting the whole time? Had she ever loved me?”~“Why did she do it? How could she?”Jeez, melodramatic much?✖ Theo’s narrative was filled withpainfully overdone monologuesthat have little purpose since they don’t make Theo into a realistic and nuanced character and most of the time they do not even further the plot. Alicia’s narrative (that is, her diary) makes no sense but more on that when I tackle her character. It’s safe to say that, given that her diary entries included things such as “It took me a moment to speak. I was so taken aback I didn’t know what to say” and “I feel joyous. I feel full of hope”, I had a hard time ‘immersing’ myself or ‘buying’ into her narrative.Since this book is a ‘domestic thriller’ both Theo and Alicia don’t have sex they ‘fuck’. Because writing ‘we fucked’ makes the story gritty and ‘dark’ [insert laughter here].✖The Greek ‘connection’.Done properly, I usually love it when contemporary books draw parallels from Greek myths and or classics.Done properly.Comparing people to Greek statues and having your main characters referring to themselves as being a ‘Greek hero/heroine’ is the opposite of subtle:“She was a statue; a Greek goddess come to life in my hands.” ~ “He looked like a Greek statue” ~ “the actress playing Alcestis looked like a Greek statue” ~ “my fate was already decided—like in a Greek tragedy” ~ “Casting herself as a tragic heroine”.We have Diomedes who comes from “a long line of Greek shepherds” (and tells Theo that “every Greek knows his tragedies”). And finally we have Alicia’s painting which is entitled Alcestis.Both the painting and Euripides play hadpotential. They would have been enough.We didn’t need the constant reminder thatThe Silent Patientwants to be a ‘tragic play’. Like many other things in this book,the blatant symbolism managed to ruin a potentially good analogy.✖ These characters donotsound British.They talk like Americans(or what Americans sound like in a CSI episode). There are no British cultural references and or British expressions. This book could be set anywhere.✖ The story is set supposedly in the UK. But really, there is 0 sense of place. Who cares about giving your characters a backdrop? Why bother rendering a neighbourhood or an area of London? Who gives a fork about what a room or place looks like? Let\'s remember: this story could be set anywhere (ornowheregiven how realistic it is).✖ You could say that thefocus on dialogues and flat scenery are reminiscent of a play...which is fine but it doesn’t come across as such.This book just reminds me of a ‘B-movie’ script.There is no tragedy, no pathos , no wit.A 2nd grade play is closer to a \'classic\' play than this book is.✖There is this attempt to make the two ‘main’ women ethereal which did provides a few laughs:“Her white dress glowed ghostlike in the torchlight” ~ “I remember so much white everywhere: […] the white of her eyes, her teeth, her skin. I’d never known that skin could be so luminous, so translucent ; ivory white with occasional blue veins visible just beneath the surface, like threads of color in white marble. She was a statue.” ~ “strands of long red hair falling across bony shoulders, blue veins beneath the translucent skin”.✎THE CHARACTERS✖ Theo. Our wannabeTom Ripley. Within a few pages we know that he is obsessed with Alicia (which makes him incredibly unprofessional) and he for the most part he is justsoooodull and whiny. He moans about his childhood,and his wife, Kathy, who is cheating on him because she is a beautiful actress so...that\'s what they do, isn\'t it?, andhis attempt(s) to self-fashion himself as some sort of tragic hero fail epically. Afterthe big reveal...well. His character makes even less forking sense. He stalked Alicia before breaking into her house. He must have known learnt about her, or made same 2+2 type of reasoning upon learning of her arrest. And he must have realised why she kept silent, especially after he reads Alcestis.This guy issoooothick.Hisdramatic monologues, constant whinging, and complete lack of awareness(I\'ve said it before this man is thick) made him into a really unbelievable character.✖Alicia...she is beautiful.She loves having sex with her husband and painting. That’s about it. We are told that she was ‘charming’...buthow can she have gained this reputation since she has 0 friendsand her only real relationship is the one she has with Gabriel (her partner or whatever). Jean-Felix is the owner of a gallery but they don’t spend time together or are on friendly terms.Who is she charming to?She is a complete recluse! She lives in London and is good enough painter and yet...she has managed to make 0 connections.Her diary entries make her sound at best guileless and at worst like adementedchild. Her character is just an object.She is there to look beautiful and tragic.She has a fewbasic reactions(she just “looks up” or “looks down”) or she doesthe good ol’ ‘banshee’ act, flinging herself in a sudden ‘rage’ towards Theo or another patient. Wow. Such a deep and complex portrait of abetrayed and traumatised woman.✖The cast of characters consists in cardboard cutouts. Going back to Christie, sometimes exaggerated character can be entertaining. Especially if they are a parodying a certain type of person (the writer, the artist, the gossipy old lady and so forth). Here we have mere ‘sketches’ of people.We have Christian, who doesn’t like Theo because he is amassive bellendbully: “Christian glared at me.” “Christian looked irritated.” “Christian rolled his eyes at me.” “Christian laughed that annoying laugh of his.”We haveProfessor Diomedes who is Greek and is “an unorthodox man’...that’s it folks. That’s his character. Also,I cannot seriously believe that he was so unprofessional and blind about Theo (and his flagrant obsession with Alicia).Yuri is another pointless and unbelievable addition to the story.He is the head psychiatric nurse and comes from Latvia so heobviouslyhas to be weird about women.Makes perfect sense. Then we have Stephanie who has very little page time or importanceTheo having never even know of her existence knows immediately, before she even speaks, that she is Caribbean). We also have the “jolly Caribbean dinner ladies” (who,surprise surprise, are only mentionedonce).We have a few‘ugly’characters who are either ‘mad’ and or violent(Elif, a ‘massive’ Turkish woman, who spends her time shouting or grunting because she is a patient and that’s how ‘ugly’ and mentally ill people behave.Lydia, Alicia’s mean aunt. She is grotesquely ‘fat’ and has lots of cats. She basically just glares, scorns, and spits at people). Paul, Alicia’s cousin, still lives with his mother so he looks like ‘virgin’ and in spite his size he seems ‘stunted’. Kathy and Gabriel arethe antithesis of credible(actors and fashion photographers manage to be self-engrossed and 1 dimensional). We have Gabriel’s brother...who is the typical chip-on-my-shoulder character (he has acne, he is balding, he is just a ‘lawyer’,boohoo). Jean-Felix owns a gallery so he is the embodiment ofsome sort of art-vampire.✎THE NONSENSICAL PLOT✖ Nothing much happens. It’s quite clear thatthe words that exist before the ‘twist’ serve as filler. Theo moans about this and that. That\'s about 70% of the novel.✖ There area series of stupid thingshappening forno apparent reason.such as Paul hitting Theo with a bat. WHY.✖ The Grove is not a forensic unit. I am sure that Theo should be doing a bit of paperwork to cover his 1 to 1s with Alicia. And everything thathappens in the Grove is extremely unlikely. Rules, guidelines, procedures are flung out of the window.✖ The ‘big twist’is predictable.We know Theo is unreliable.All of his actions towards Alicia, his research and his ‘interviews’ makeno bloody sense. He already knows about her! And unlesshe is incredibly thick, he should do 2+2 and figure out why she isn’t talking. The twist makes his motivations and approach to Alicia completely pointless. Theo hadn’t forgotten what he’d done, and his narrative isn’t in the format of a diary, where he would be deliberately lying and omitting certain things. Why not make this novel into more of a confessional? Or more in the vein ofThe Talented Mr. Ripley,You,Lolita, or evenGentlemen and Players, where we know early on what he has done and we wonder if he will be caught or if he will done something worse.IN CONCLUSIONThe Silent Patientmight notbe the worst novel I’ve read but it’sa badly written, poorly developed book. Worse still,The Silent Patientcomes across as being both pointless and passionless.A ‘twist’ needs—demands—a story. I want to read characters who vaguely resemble or talk like real people. If you want to play with stereotypes (a la Christie) don\'t make yourcharacters take themselves so seriously.A parody of a certain \'personality\' should at least be funny and or amusing.Adding a strong setting and a coherent storyline wouldn’t do any harm either.Overall:The Silent Patientis a messy, flat, painfully dull, \'Hollywood-type\' of book.Read more reviews on my blogIf you likedVerity,An Anonymous Girl,The Last Time I Liedor the unintentionally hilariousJane Doe...chances are you will likeThe Silent Patient.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'This book starts off really strong with a great premise - intriguing and mysterious right away - the writing is even pretty strong in the beginning, but somewhere along the way it all seemed to fall apart for me.

It just gets so convoluted and meandering, and I couldn’t really follow what actually happened, from what was meant to be the lies and fantasy of some characters. The author also spends an awful lot of the book having the main character, Theo, ‘investigate’ Alicia’s family members - the cousin, the aunt, the brother in law, her gallery manager - and each of them is made to seem weird, untrustworthy and in some cases outright creepy - but all of it ends up just feeling like a cheap trick, because nothing comes of any of them. Like, for example, the plot about the brother in law assaulting her, or the cousin borrowing money, - none of those things are resolved and it just feels like a lazy way for the author to point our suspicions in the wrong direction while leaving frustrating loose ends everywhere. I mean, you can make any character seem suspicious and create false suspense very easily if you have no obligation to deliver any resolutions.In the author’s single quest to deliver the big ‘twist’ he also left big holes in the plot and expected us to overlook implausible things... like, one small but obvious thing - at the start of the book Theo’s belongings are searched by ‘security’ before entering the hospital and he is specifically told he can’t have any lighters for “obvious reasons” - can’t have any of the psychiatric patients getting their hands on a way to start fires - (now the author didn’t need to mention this in the story - he could have lost this scene and not drawn attention to the fact that Theo was not allowed to bring in a lighter - not sure why it was even a point??) but then through out the book the characters smoke cigars and cigarettes in the hospital ... how do they light them?? They all carry matches I assume? Are matches any less likely to start a fire??! There were SO MANY eye-rolling moments through out the book like that one, and far worse. So many times we, as readers, were expected to buy into implausible actions by characters (like Alicia’s cousin beating Theo over the head with a baseball bat and knocking him out because he thought he was an intruder (in his yard - not even his house!), and then not to mention Theo feeling fine and not needing any medical attention??) or just overlook unbelievable scenarios - like Theo following his wife’s lover for miles and never once actually seeing his face?? When the police investigate the scene of Alicia’s husband’s death, how do they not find the rope and wire that was used to tie up Alicia? And Who has enough rope and wire just lying around in their house to tie up two adults anyway?! And another doozy - Theo injects Alicia with enough morphine to put her in a coma for the rest of her life, but she has time to find a pen and diary and write a very lucid, long entry explaining Theo’s role in everything?! Besides the fact that she would be completely out of it and totally incapable of writing, even if she could, why wouldn’t she, I don’t know, go get help because you’ve just been injected with a lethal dose of morphine, instead of writing a short story??! And then with a lethal amount of morphine coursing through her blood stream she takes the time to hide her diary in a picture frame?! Seriously?! It’s almost funny.And what about Alicia’s silence?? The mystery at the heart of the book - in the very title itself. The big reveal, the big answer shrouded in suspense and mystery .... the reason she didn’t talk was because she felt she had nothing to say??? Because she felt like she was dead too?? Wait... what? Seriously? She’s been accused of murdering her husband, while the man who stalks her, breaks in to her home, ties her up and threatens to kill her later shows up as her therapist, while she allows her other therapist to continue drugging her with “horse dosage” amounts of sedatives - but oh well, silence for years and years because she felt dead and had nothing to say?? And she stays silent mind you, while she still manages to hide her diary?!? We can only assume she goes to extreme measures to keep the police from ever finding it? Even though they walk in right after the murder while she’s still holding the smoking gun - I guess they gave her time to gather her things and somehow hide a diary down her pants while she was brought to prison?? Not to mention how no one found it when she was transferred to the mental hospital?! Why go to so much trouble to hide a diary if you feel like you’re dead and you have nothing to say!?Giant eye roll.I’m sorry - this book just asks too much of the reader - this ‘twist’ has been done many times before and it only works (and still very poorly) if you overlook all the giant plot holes and ridiculous scenarios.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""This is easily one of the best mystery/thrillers, if notthebest, I have ever read.Alicia shoots her beloved husband in the face five times, then never speaks another word. Theo, a psychotherapist, is captivated by Alicia's story and wants to help her. He thinks he can get her to speak again and divulge why she killed her husband. What follows is a search for truth in what really happened between Alicia and her husband.First of all, if you haven't read this book yet, you absolutely should. And you should stop reading my review and any other reviews/blurbs/thoughts about this book until you do. Because while I always strive to make my reviews 100% spoiler-free (this one included), there's something to be said for expectations. And there's no way reading anything about this book wouldn't sway your expectations.I made the mistake, after reading this book and loving it, of not only recommending it to a friend, but also talking up how much this book amazed me, how great the reveals were, yada yada yada. And so when she read it, she had built up an inkling of something to come and anticipated it, hence losing the element of surprise. So I inadvertently committed the biggest book faux-paus ever and ruined a fantastic book for a friend. It's something I regret to this day. (Elaine, if you're reading this, I'm so sorry!)I certainly don't want to do that again. So yeah, I'm warning you. Last chance to turn back if you haven't read this book.Okay, now that I'm among only those who are in the know, I feel like I can freely gush. How amazing was that reveal?! I usually have terrible book memory, but I'm certain I will remember that reveal for the rest of my life. It wasn't just what it was, but also how it was executed. Not only did I not see the twist coming, but I was so surprised I stared open-mouthed at my book and reread it multiple times to make sure my brain could comprehend the complete mind bend of what I had just experienced.But to simplify this story down to just its reveal feels like an injustice. At its heart, this is a confounding murder mystery and it includes all of the requisite parts—clues, suspicious persons, and red herrings. We are directed one way, then another. But like any great mystery, the real magic is in its sleight of hand. While we are focused on one thing, really something else is going on altogether. And at the end, we can only wonder at the sheer audacity of what it takes to pull off such a magical feat.The story grabbed me from the very beginning with an intensity that didn't let go. Once I started, I couldn't put it down. I was turning the pages as fast as I could, immersed in the experience and loving every moment. It only took me a few hours to get through the whole thing, and at the end my head was definitely left spinning in the best way possible.Recently, I read it again. I wanted to see if the magic of the first time is still there or if, now knowing the twists, the story would feel lesser than. And I'm so happy to report that I loved it just as much the second time around. Now, instead of having to pay attention to the plot, I could really focus on how masterfully Alex Michaelides built up the mystery and its reveal. And it really is something to marvel at.I have to say, books of this genre are always billed as astounding and surprising when most of the time they just feel contrived and silly with no payoff at the end. But wow, does this book deliver! It's so darn satisfying to read such a compulsively addicting story, with twists done right that left me absolutely speechless.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:The MaidensThe Fury~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

This will still be an overall positive review, but I felt I had to include some honest thoughts here as well for those readers who may need their expectations in line like I clearly did.The premise here is simply incredible; we have a woman named Alicia Berenson who is accused of murdering her husband and proceeds to clam up and keep quiet for the following six years, living during this time in a mental care facility called The Grove for highly dangerous folks. Enter Theo Faber, psychotherapist extraordinaire and flawed individual. He already has a respectable job elsewhere, but decides to transfer over to The Grove, even though it is a sinking ship, because he is obsessed with Alicia and solving the mystery behind why she murdered her husband. Along the way, we get snippets into Alicia\'s diary leading up to the murder, alongside of Theo\'s POV.I can\'t really give you anything more than this, because this is a novel that depends on you being fooled by the twist. You know, the big twist, the one where every blurb on the cover and every early review gives you a heads up, and perhaps that was part of the issue here for me. It seems these types of books that pull the wool over your eyes and take you by surprise are best enjoyed before anyone else has had a chance to read them. Let\'s come back around to the fact that I\'ve been reading mysteries, thrillers, and suspense novels for decades, way beforeGone Girlwas written and these domestic dramas with tricky slight-of-hand became all the rage. If you are new-ish to the psych thriller scene, and you whole heartedly enjoyed recent novels such asThe Woman In The Window, you will adore this. It was a well written, compulsive, slow burning build up to an explosive ending. Structurally, it had everything you could ask for, as it was well researched, engaging, and the perfect length of ""includes what we need without being overly winded"".Unfortunately, I\'ve seen this particular twist done numerous times, so I was clued in fairly early to what the big twist would be, and without spoiling or giving anything away, the lay out of the narrative in the second half of the novel is what fully clued me in, because it was too neat and tidy to end any other way. I will say that I was so satisfied and pleased with the way the author chose to close out the final chapter, and regardless of being surprised by the twist or not, it was a classic wrap up that will stand the test of time over the years.I think I\'m going to wrap it up here, and please don\'t let my 3 star rating dissuade you from giving this one a try. Michaelides is talented, and his writing is gripping and keeps you turning the pages regardless of the big twist. I would be honored to read his next novel and will most certainly look for his name in the future. In the meantime I have found so much in this novel worth discussing, from the portrayal of mental health care to the inner workings of various marriages, and think this will make a great winter book club choice for readers around the globe.*Many thanks to the publisher for providing my review copy via NetGalley.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Read anything else on your TBR first. Anything. Better yet, delete The Silent Patient from your TBR. If you do, you\'ll never know what it feels like to become aware that you could have spent that 4 - 5 hours reading a great book ... or at least a better book.... definitely a book that doesn\'t do a major disservice to anyone who practices in the mental health field or who lives with a mental health impairment, and maybe even a book that doesn\'t present misogyny on every page.The Silent Patient fails as a psychological thriller on all fronts. Its narrator lacks any credibility as a psychotherapist, as an employee, as a spouse, as a man. All characters are flat and inauthentic. The plot doesn\'t hang together. The solution telegraphs itself long before the ending, and still makes no sense. Michaelides wastes time on sub-plots that are irrelevant, introduces red herring characters with no subtlety so the reader is merely annoyed. Offers us a lawyer who is instantly available more than once to meet with someone he seeks not to meet., and a therapist who sees a former (long..... former, like .... years) patient at her home at 10 pm, and then risks malpractice by offering advice to him. And the writing is pedestrian, at best.Aside from its flaws as a psychological thriller, Michaelides demonstrates that he knows nothing about mental health diagnoses, treatments and indicated medications, but the biases he displays in this novel contribute to a culture of misinformation that may discourage a reader who needs treatment for therapy from getting it, and may discourage other readers from complying with a treatment plan that includes prescription medications in amounts that data shows have therapeutic benefits. The girlfriend, then wife, of the narrator, describes herself as ""crazy"" a dozen or so times, and yet this is not relevant to any sort of mental health diagnosis over the span of the novel. In a span of ten pages, he describes a character as being in ""a medicated haze"", but the med he names wouldn\'t cause that effect at any dosage. One psychotherapist meets with a patient 2 - 3 times and instead of evidencing any interest in the health of the patient, he primarily focuses on how her behavior might be disturbing her spouse. Another psychotherapist agrees to change a patient\'s prescription med mix on a whim, and overnight, without any plan for a gradual step-down or other concern for patient impact. A third character presses unidentified meds into a patient\'s hand and requires that she consume them in his/her presence. None of the medical professionals, save the one risking malpractice, demonstrate competency or concern for the welfare of their patients.All of the male characters running this facility repeatedly refer to all of the female patients as ""bitch;"" all of the patients in the facility are women. Every female character displays unpleasant behaviors that range in consequence from minor to severe: unfaithful, gossip-y, violent, vengeful, insecure, impulsive, annoying, tiresome, disloyal.I\'ve written a review of this horrid novel only because I might spare a friend or two. Every time someone deletes this book from his or her TBR without reading it, an angel gets his wings.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'As you will see, it’s an incredible story—of that there is no doubt.Whether you believe it or not is up to you.Ohhhh, I see why this book is getting so much buzz:it is virtually unputdownable.I didn\'t actually have any plans to readThe Silent Patient. I just happened to see it hanging around in the new releases, took a quick peek, and thought-- why not? Well, I\'ll tell you why not. You absolutely definitely should NOT read this book if you want to go to sleep and get up for real life stuff in the morning. I read this until my eyes were like ""nope"" and closed on their own.It\'s very compelling. A psychotherapist called Theo Faber narrates the story and he announces early on that he\'s pretty ""fucked up"". He worms his way into a new job at the Grove mental health facility because of his fascination with the artist Alicia Berenson, who murdered her husband in an open-and-shut case and hasn\'t spoken a word since.But let us not forget that while Alicia Berenson may be a murderer, she was also an artist.Theo finds himself connecting with Alicia and feeling a desperate need to figure out why she did it. And, what\'s more, he wants to figure out why she is silent. What can\'t she say? What won\'t she say? The more he digs into her life, her family, and her past, the deeper in he gets.It\'s a fast-paced ride with short punchy chapters (oh, how easy it is to think ""just one more chapter""). The story has so many threads and little surprises to uncover. More questions arise at every turn. And even those who work out the main aspect of the mystery will probably still enjoy the journey of finding out why, and all the little shocking discoveries made along the way.It is true that those who have read a number of twisty mysteries will likely guess the truth, but I think there\'s enough goodness here to make it enjoyable anyway.

Will Theo get Alicia talking again? What actually happened all those years ago?Yes, this book really is as good as all of the hype. The writing on this was really top rate. Michaelides knew perfectly how to create intrigue and how to use dialogue with varying short and long paragraphs and short and long chapters to create the perfect pacing for this work. It was incredibly page turning, and the author definitely showed his chops as a mystery writer. He could write a master class in mystery writing. And this is his debut novel! What will Michaelides go from here? Personally, I can hardly wait to find out.Theo is gaining information about what happened in the past, but he is also questioning his own abilities. Can he really get Alicia talking? What are the professional boundaries of a psychotherapist? There was a little bit of internal monologue with Theo, but it wasn't boring or drawn out unnecessarily but raised some deep questions, causing the reader to think beyond just the superficial mystery/thriller. There was also some mention of art and its deeper meaning. It helped to create added depth to this book.Overall, yes, yes, and yes! This book is phenomenal if you haven't read it already!

The women are all tired, cliched stereotypes that often veer into misogyny. For example, Alicia’s aunt is described the first time you meet her as an ugly, old face pressed to a window, and it only gets worse after that because—of course—she’s fat. Her “grotesque” (a word actually used in the book) appearance is apparently a mirror of her evil personality. How creative! The author takes that approach over and over again: young, naturally beautiful women like Alicia and Theo’s wife are worthy of interest, while the female characters Theo can’t find attractive—because they’re ugly, old, large, fat, fake, stupid—are only worth his disdain.Beyond that, the prose was tough to get through. And don’t even get me started on the diary sections, which portray Alicia as a woman who either sits in a coffee shop for hours on end, has sex with her husband, or paints him as Jesus (no, I’m not kidding). The chapters where she couldn’t speak were almost a relief.Overall, the author just seemed more invested in getting to the the clever twist ending than in writing a full-bodied story with women who seem like, you know, actual people.Which is a pity, because that clever twist ending had potential.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5 shining stars!We finally have a winner.

From the very first page I was seduced by the magnetic writing style of Alex Michaelides.Nothing is as it seems in this novel. This story is complex and multi-layered with a labyrinth of characters, each playing their part in the development of the plot.The author never once tries to lead you astray with erroneous clues in an attempt to distract you from an obvious conclusion.

All opinions are my own.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '(Throwback review) Isn\'t it strange that we immensely love and hate a book at the same time? Many of you might have had such an experience at least once in your lifetime. Well, this book was the one which gave me that feeling.First of all, let me start with what I liked in this book. The writing style of the author is suited for writing a thriller like this. He succeeded in making me glued to the book even after the glaring innuendos that were disparaging to the core kept me exasperated. He worked out the plot twist well. This might be the reason why almost every friend of mine in Goodreads love this book. I must confess now itself that if I was not a Doctor and I didn\'t know how the healthcare system works, I would also have given this book four or five stars.This is a book which won the best book in the thriller section in Goodreads award last year. If you are promoting a book as a psychological thriller, there are two things which the author should be careful about. One is to get the thriller aspect correct, which the author had succeeded, and the second is to get the Psychological aspect right, which is where the aberration lies here.The author had unabashedly mentioned some things about Psychotherapy in which some are true in some rare cases while some have unfortunately gone entirely wrong. The author has no right to generalise about the health sector as a whole based on some scrupulous activities done by some individuals. You can\'t even see such a shady Psychiatric institution in any dystopian world. Mr Michaelides, who is a Cambridge product, had an excellent opportunity to produce one of the best thrillers. Unfortunately, he didn\'t do the adequate research in the psychological aspects needed for this book.There are many mistakes regarding psychotherapy, treatment methods, various disorders, therapy sessions, medical ethics in this book. Initially, Theo, who happens to be a psychotherapist, is strangely saying that his father had a personality disorder which he is mentioning as an illness that went untreated for the duration of his life, which is, in fact, rather absurd. There is no definitive treatment or drug for the management of personality disorders. The only way in which we can manage it is by behavioural modification therapies like the DBT (Dialectical behavioural therapy) and CBT (Cognitive behavioural therapy). I am sharing four pictures here for my friends who are utterly perplexed due to being thrown into the crazy world of complicated medical jargon by the author in this novel bolt out of the blue.The author should have done more research on topics like the transference, countertransference, Borderline personality disorder, Narcissistic personality disorder before writing this book.I remember having an entrancing discussion about this book with one of my friends who is a Psychiatrist in D.C. We concluded that we should not be pedantic about it and leave it alone as just another painfully didactic fiction which came in the disguise of a psychological thriller.It is poignant to see Entertainment Weekly calling it ""an unforgettable — and Hollywood-bound — new thriller"" with ""a mix of Hitchcockian suspense, Agatha Christie plotting, and Greek tragedy."" I heard that the silver screen version of this book is in the pipeline. I humbly request Mr Michaelides, who also happens to be a screenwriter to correct all the flaws in the novel in the upcoming movie.I had the expectations of being enraptured by this book before reading it. But unfortunately, I abhorred this book to such an extent that I curtailed from reading other thrillers for some time. All the other thrillers I might read after this one will be desultory attempts. I am sure that I will recover from this one. I am sad that Alex Michaelides missed a golden opportunity to create a masterpiece.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""The thing about this book is that it’s only the plot twist.The story itself is just leadup to it.

Otherwise this would have been so infuriatingly disappointing I would have had to put the book over my face and take deep calming breaths in the dark for upwards of 45 minutes.All of that is to say that this has a very, very, very slow start, and the writing fell very flat for me.Plus it’s not...theleastwoman-hate-y book I’ve ever read.But we all have our things.Bottom line: Meh.-------------i finished this book 3 days ago. i just didn't have anything to say about it.review to come / 2.5? stars-------------dear book,please be scary.or thrilling.or plot twist-y.or surprising.or something. anything!love, me""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'My thanks to Ben Willis at Orion Publishing Group for sending me a paperback copy of ‘The Silent Patient’ I have given an honest unbiased review in exchange*Alicia Berenson was discovered standing over her husband - he’d been tied to a chair and shot in the face five times.

Theo is certain that he can get her to talk, even though others have tried and failed.Although Alicia is silent, the narrative speaks to us in a way that she can’t or won’t, throwing the spotlight on the minutiae of her life as a talented artist, and ultimately what led to the events of that fateful night.Theo’s own personal life is laid bare too, and he’s also a very complex character - indeed not unlike Alicia. If Theo’s attempts to encourage Alicia to speak are successful, will it be something he wants to hear?

This is one of the best books I have read this year and it will probably remain in this position once the year ends. It is full of intrigue, interesting characters and dynamics and a very fresh story. Trust me and pick it up.

Theo Faber, a criminal psychotherapist, has been obsessed with Alicia and her silence for years and he finally works his way onto the staff of at the Grove, a secure forensic unit and then manages to secure the position of Alicia's psychotherapist. Very little is really the way it seems in this addictive psychological thriller and it had me on the edge of my seat from the first chapter.I had so many questions about what was happening and what had happened with both Alicia and Theo. Theo is so ready to lie, manipulate, and use people and even though Alicia was the murderer, think I felt more danger from Theo and his shady practices. And then I was hit with twist at the end of the book, which took me by surprise. I knew something was up but I hadn't quite figured it out and was thrilled with how the book took me for ride, tripping me up along the way.Published February 5th 2019""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '***NOW AVAILABLE***Well looks like I’m the outlier on this book as I have been reading many glowing 5 star reviews. Maybe I’ve been reading too many thrillers lately. For me to love a thriller all of the characters have to be well developed and intricate to the story, the plot has to be a good one and have more to offer than just the “thrill”, or wow factor at the end of the book. I found the characters to be shallow and the plot seemed to run off in several directions throughout the course of the novel.I should add that a 3* from me means that the book was just an o.k. read for me, not bad but not great enough that I will be thinking of it long after I’ve finished or be recommending it to my friends. Still worth a read :)One thing proved true, this book did have me turning the pages quickly to find out what would happen at the end. However while I was turning these pages quickly, I wasn’t really getting very much out of the story. I felt as though the fact that she wouldn’t speak was the main focus of the book rather than looking into whether she was really guilty or not. I know that she had been tried and found guilty but I had hoped that perhaps the doctors would find other issues worth pursuing regarding her guilt or innocence.There are multiple characters introduced but none of them are really very well described. Dr. Diomedes is the head of the facility and he appoints a new doctor, Theo Faber, who has recently joined the staff to oversee Alicia’s care. She had previously been under the care of another physician but he hadn’t made any progress with her and so it is hoped that this new doctor will help to make her finally speak.The book is narrated by Theo and then later by Alicia as we begin to read her previously hidden diary.The book takes place in “The Grove” a private facility for psychiatric patients. Theo Faber transferred from another facility because he is obsessed with Alicia’s case. We do get to know him through his thoughts about his own marriage to Karen who seems increasingly “busy” and coming home late from rehearsals, she is an actress. This is a storyline that is introduced and somewhat developed and then just left hanging. What really is going on with Theo’s marriage? He seems to be spending all of his time at the facility with Alicia.SPOILER ALERT***Alicia had been a successful artist and Gabriel a photographer of some repute. There really is never any answer to the question of “why”, why would Alicia kill Gabriel. There doesn’t seem to be any evidence that they were unhappy or that Gabriel was unfaithful, there doesn’t seem to have been much research as to why she would kill her husband. She was convicted because she was found at the scene with the gun in her hand, covered in blood because she had slit her wrists in an attempt to kill herself.The twist is a good one but doesn’t come until the last 20 pages or so. I had pretty much figured it out by then but I’m sure it will come as a surprise to many.I would say read it without reading lots of reviews, decide for yourself if it is indeed “the debut novel of the year for 2019” as the publisher has written in the blurb for the book! After the last session that Theo had with Alicia he is writing everything down while it was still fresh in his mind and he states ""As you will see, it\'s an incredible story--of that there is no doubt. Whether you believe it or not is up to you.""I received a copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides is a 2019 Celadon Books publication.When this book first started to garner a little buzz, I initially shied away from it. I am still avoiding psychological thrillers for the most part. However, the reviews were so overwhelmingly positive I relented, adding it to my TBR list. After a lengthy wait at the library, I finally obtained a copy, and dived in with no small amount of cautious optimism. Was it worth the wait? Did it live up to the hype?The set- up is instantly intriguing-Theo Faber, a criminal psychotherapist is oddly obsessed with the well- respected artist, Alicia Berenson, a patient housed in a forensic unit after shooting her husband five times in the face. She hasn’t uttered a word since. Theo sacrifices better and more lucrative opportunities in hopes of becoming her therapist. As he manipulates his way into Alicia’s life, his determination to unlock the secrets of her heart and mind slowly yields a few surprising results. However, all his probing could have a few unforeseen consequences...Anyone who has read a review for this book has, by now, heard about the stunning twist that apparently caught most readers off guard. But, let’s not get too hung up on the twist. In my humble opinion, a mind -blowing twist is a requirement of any and all psychological thrillers. What makes a twist work in the first place is the mystery.Did Alicia kill her husband, as all the evidence suggests? If so, what was her motive? Why hasn’t she uttered a single word in all these years? This is a compelling mystery. Alicia an enigma, to be sure. This is unsettling enough on its own merits.However, the author also examines some hard truths about institutions that rely on funding, which leads to money and power taking precedent over the welfare and health of the patients. Adding in yet another rich layer is the unique and quite interesting mythological parallel woven into the story.It is easy to step into Theo’s narrative as he slowly walks us through Alicia’s past, dropping hints and clues along the way, introducing us to all the possible suspects, while delving into Alicia’s fragile psyche.But, if I am being totally honest, the plot is not all that plausible, and at times the execution warbles. There are some problems within the story, but in my humble opinion, this is how a pure psychological thriller should be presented. The author relies on paranoia and the emotional instability of the characters to build suspense as opposed to grisly, graphic crime scenes. It’s a mind game from start to finish.Now, about that twist-The most important thing to me was that it was singular. No over the top, unnecessary twists added for mere shock value. A good PT doesn’t need more than one, maybe two, depending on the author’s experience or the situation- in my opinion.In this case, the reader is totally blindsided, tapped on the shoulder from behind, by a revelation so shocking, I’ll bet some of you gasped out loud. I know I did! It messed with your head, right? Now THAT’S what I’m talking about!!Of course, after all that buildup and the success of the big plot twist, the ending had to come together, or all was for naught. I was a little concerned for a few minutes, but honestly, the conclusion was the cherry on the cake.The book was worth waiting for, but I am glad I proceeded with caution and kept my expectations in check. The story is not quite strong enough to merit a five -star rating, but I appreciated the pure, traditional understated approach. The author wisely dialed things back, distancing himself from the oversaturated parodies many current psychological thrillers have become. I hope the popularity of this book with inspire more authors to follow this more authentic prototype and restore the psychological thriller back to its former glory.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3 to 3.5 starsI have a few friends that are probably going to wonder why I am not rating this one higher. I did think it was a decent thriller and I can tell why many rate it high. But, it is also easy for me to tell why someone would rate it low. I am just going to hang out pretty close to the middleThe best part of this book was definitely the resolution. The build up to it was okay, but not all that suspenseful to me. There were a few big moments throughout the book, but it was mainly just exposition. Also, I figured out the ""mystery"" early on. This is not me tooting my own horn like I am an amazing detective. It was more like I stumbled on it by accident. About 1/3 to 1/2 of the way in I thought,""wouldn\'t it be interesting if . . ."" and that is exactly what happened!The characters were kind of flat to me. I think part of my opinion on them is tainted by the fact that I just finished another thriller, The Whisper Man. In that one, the characters are much more dynamic and the relationships are much more interesting. Despite some twisting and turning, the relationships here are plain vanilla and a bit predictable.I will stress again, especially because I know that many are rating this one highly, that my criticisms above are just little things that I felt and I know for certain that others won\'t feel at all. So, don\'t read my review and go in thinking it is going to rate middle of the road for you, too. You might be one who really gets into it!Basically, an entertaining thriller. Not too deep. The perfect book for a quick escape. Easy to read and follow the twists and turns. Solid, but not really exceptional.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Sadly I have read Fifty Shades of Grey, so I cannot call The Silent Patient the absolute worst book ever. Instead I\'ll just call it awful, truly and in all ways, from its portrayal of mental illness, to its utter lack of believability, to its stupid, stupid, stupid characters. One of whom gets an eyeball gouged out and I almost feel like doing the same to myself for having read this thing from start to stupid finish.The story takes place in a mental institution, where most of the psychiatric professionals are presumably tweens and teens. Patients are permitted to wander at will carrying items such as broken cue sticks, which I would think might be a bit jagged and sharp and thereforepotentially quite dangerous, but, what do I know. Theo, the main character-slash-psychotherapist, gets a job at this facility and on his very first day he decides which patient he\'d like to treat. He is not only permitted to treat his choice of patient -- he is also, conveniently, given no other duties aside from trying to get this SILENT PATIENT to speak. I feel like he should have at least had some paperwork, some standard mandatory training modules, something. But no.Anyway, the SILENT PATIENT has been silent for years, ever since murdering her husband, but no one else bothers with her anymore because most of the rest of the staff think she\'s a ""bitch."" Theo, in a true flash of psychiatric brilliance, wonders if perhaps heraggressively drugged stuporis preventing her from talking. Really it\'s a wonder none of the other doctors thought of this. In any case, his boss naturally agrees to reduce the dosage of her medication right away. I am sure that in real mental health facilities this is exactly how it goes.At one point, Theo discovers that one of the staff has been selling opoids to patients. His immediate thought: ""I wondered what else he was up to—perhaps I had been a little too hasty to defend him so determinedly to Stephanie. I’d better keep an eye on him."" YES, Theo, definitely KEEP AN EYE ON HIM. Jesus.In the meantime, Theo decides to harass his patient\'s family and friends to see if they might provide clues as to why she won\'t talk. There is a dramatic scene in which a cousin takes Theo up onto a roof. For no reason. ""This is where we were when we heard her father say the thing he said to make her crazy for the rest of her life,"" or some such nonsense. AHA, it\'s all coming together now!As to why Alicia, the patient, won\'t talk?Well, she\'d just been held captive by a masked man for hours, and when her husband arrived home he suggested that the masked man kill her instead of him, most likely because he didn\'t realize he was in a novel and that such husbands in modern fiction do stand a good chance of being murdered by their fictional wives. For whatever reason, at that point the masked man decided he\'d had enough for one day and left, killing neither of the two. And then Alicia, presumably perturbed at her husband\'s less-than-chivalrous behavior, shot him five times in the face. And apparently after all that, she simply had nothing to say.That is really the reason.*Thanks universe that this was a library book and not an actual purchase*'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'WOW... This is a great book.This is a psychological thriller, and it is one of my favorites. I really did not see the book ending like it did. I cannot say much about this book without giving away to much of the book, but I felt it was a great book with some of the best twist I have read. I think if you did not see the ending coming you will like it, but if you guess the ending will may not like it as much.'}]"

Nobody knows about her intimate connection to Shane Nelson, one of the penitentiary's most notorious and dangerous inmates.

Brooke why are you doing this to yourself.I honestly feel for Brooke. Being treated the way that she did in the aftermath of the murders, it was really hard for her. Standing up to her parents after being shunned by them and raising a child on her own, that takes courage. Being woken up by the same strangled-by-your-own-necklace nightmare, that takes a toll on your mental health. Losing your friends and witnessing their deaths, that kind of trauma carries through. The triggers, they linger. Even more so, the memories, they stay with you.However ...Explain it to me, if Brooke was still so traumatized by the events from 10 years ago, how was she not repulsed by the sight of Shane in her patient room? She believed Shane strangled her yet she was practically restless and swooning upon seeing him.Oh my shirt was hanging a little low and my cleavage was showing! Nah, it's fine, he prolly don't see much boobs in here. —Are you kidding me?!Explain to me, how, if Shane was murdering upstairs, you smelled sandalwood on your strangler? Or that the strangler felt heavy and bulky on you? Is this a case of an 'unreliable memory' after a traumatic event? Or is this a case of dumb teenager in the wild?Explain to me how Tim never recognized the baby sitter as the one who sold him the necklace? Or how, given Tim's love for Brooke, would he gift her a broken necklace on her birthday no less?!A broken necklace?! On her birthday?! Are you kidding me?!There has been far too many issues to dismiss. The reason for the murder is so bad. Are we really going to buy that a life-sentence can be overturned that easily? Or that a correctional facility would hire someone associated with a prisoner even if they were that desperate?Brooke was written too dumb for this to be remotely enjoyable.Another idiot-driven plot. Actually, I'm beginning to think McFadden writes the dumbest protagonists — women who are helpless and can hardly think for themselves.I had picked this up because my feed is just swamped with McFadden recommendations. Every McFadden read of mine is not good so far, so I'm now on a hunt for a McFadden thriller that's actuallythrillingto disabuse me of this notion that she writes thrillers for bored teens.Plot: ★Writing: ★""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4.0 stars— Everytime I research top thrillers on Kindle Unlimited there are numerous books with thousands of great ratings for Freida McFadden. So, I decided to read her newest book, “The Inmate”, and I have to admit it wasn’t half bad. The book begins with Brooke Sullivan starting her new job as a nurse practitioner in a maximum security prison. It happens to be the same prison where the person who was convicted of attempting to kill her and who is also the father of her 10 year old son resides. The author does a great job of interweaving the new interactions with baby daddy, Shane, with the events that led to his conviction and incarceration. As the author introduces new characters, it becomes obvious very quickly the path the book is taking for final resolution. In fact, about 1/4 of the way in I felt confident I could guess the ending. However, to the author’s credit, I was wrong and enjoyed the unexpected twists and turns the author used to finish the story. Were there numerous obvious red herrings? Yes. Did the author use many of the obvious cliches in thriller books such as storms, no cell service, impassable roads etc? Yes again. However, much like some of the summer blockbuster movies I enjoyed over the years, if you don’t over analyze and just go where the author leads you, the book was entertaining. I know many of you might disagree and call this book fluff, but I believe some books (and movies) are fast paced and entertaining enough to be worth reading.

That's the only reason it gets a star instead of me just deleting it from my memory entirely.But damn, did it get unreasonable quick. First of all, the idea that so many people can be accused of this one crime before someone starts questioning Brooke's sanity is laughable. Not to mention, this author clearly was not taking into account the length of time it takes for quite literally anything to move in the criminal justice system.There's no WAY Brooke simply recanting her testimony gets this man out of prison TEN YEARS after conviction??Also, some of the plot points were just insane. Margie/Pamela helps her kid murder all of these people over the span of ELEVEN years and then just casually gives it all up just because her son died? When the grandson is still alive???And why even bother murdering Hunt? Just to open the door to make Brooke realize Shane is an issue? With the way this book went, it almost would've been better for her not to suspect anything at all and get ambused.The POV change in the epilogue made it even worse for me - first of all, the kid sounded much younger than 10 by the way it was written, in my opinion. But then he casually confesses to killing someone? HUH???I wanted to like this. The premise of it was promising.

At least she’s not a dislikable heroine; she’s just way too naive. Reading some of her comments about Shane and Tim created a nails-on-chalkboard effect on me!I'm still eager to read anything from shopping lists to post-it scribbles by Freida McFadden to show my devotion (though I'll exclude the diary for now—it seems a bit creepy). And after seeing a few mixed reviews about the low level of the heroine’s IQ, I still try to stay objective and dive into this book, which is still on the New York Times Bestsellers list.I have to admit, the criticism is right about the main character, Brooke Sullivan, who creates an irresistible urge for you to slap her every time she overthinks who the real culprit of the brutal crimes committed ten years ago might be. It’s hard to believe she wouldn't know who tried to kill her, especially when she suspects it might be the same man she made love to just hours before.Yes, Brooke is more than a damsel in distress, and you can't help but question how a woman could live in oblivion for so long, raising a son at a young age without her parents’ guidance. It's a miracle that she stayed alive all those years with her level of naivety that makes you scream each time she overthinks and makes assumptions about the killer’s identity.I can honestly say that until I reached the last third, I was considering giving this book five stars because it started so strong.Let’s not even mention her actions, which I'll sugarcoat as naive moves—those were still tolerable. But when we reached the last third, she did things that would make a normal, patient person—or even a robot—curse! I was flabbergasted and found myself dreaming of jumping into this book to shake some sense into it or praying to God that Freida may create smarter heroines in the near future.But thankfully, the twists and the author’s epilogue, much like her previous books, are perfectly executed and will make your jaw hit the ground. You'll save your laughter for the very end.The plot revolves around our twenty-seven-year-old heroine, a nurse practitioner who recently buried her estranged parents due to her life choices, including keeping the baby of a serial killer. She inherits her family's house and moves there with her ten-year-old son, Josh.Unfortunately, she only lands one job offer, which happens to be in a men’s maximum-security prison where her ex-lover and the murderer of her friends, Shane Nelson, is an inmate. Their encounters bring out dark memories from the past and unresolved issues between them.Brooke hides the truth that they have a son, and Shane still insists he’s incarcerated for a crime he didn’t commit, which makes Brooke question the memories of that haunted night when it was too dark to see who tried to kill her. But it was Shane, wasn't it? Even though Shane thinks Brooke’s next-door neighbor—also her first kiss—Tim, who is now the principal of her son’s school, is someone she's meeting on friendly terms, might be the real killer. He put the blame on Shane by stabbing himself and acted as if Shane had done it.When Brooke starts taking this to another level with Tim, who might be the one and who has a great relationship with her son Josh, she starts seeing him in a different perspective, rethinking the events of the past. Another tragedy strikes, and she questions her decision to send Shane to prison. What if he’s telling the truth? What if she put an innocent man behind bars? What if she’s sleeping with an enemy and put not only her life but also her son’s life in danger?Despite Brooke's incredibly irritating actions, the book is a well-executed psychological thriller. Most plot holes are adequately explained, and the final twists are deliciously irresistible.Overall, I'm rounding up from 3.5 stars to 4 for this action-packed, mind-bending psychological thriller.

This whole book is just straight up plot with few descriptions of anything else that doesn’t move the plot along, probably more so than any of the other books of hers that I’ve read so far.I was definitely in the mood for something quick and hopefully surprising, and this mostly served that purpose, though it was probably a little too utilitarian at times. The writing is pretty … basic. I mean, it honestly just describes what is happening for the most part and that’s about it.I do think McFadden has a bit of a sense of humor that manages to sneak its way into some of her narration from time to time.Without giving anything away, there’s a spiderman joke in there that was completely out of place but made me actually laugh out loud.The story itself is a little weaker than other books of hers I read. I also think the premise was a little weak to begin with and kind of dreary. Plus, our protagonist Brooke sort of has to be willingly obtuse in order to make the book work.For a long stretch of the story, it seems like conclusion is going to be fairly obvious, but don’t worry, this book has much more than a surprise or two up its sleeve. The ending has plenty of surprises … but also feels really messy … but it’s also a little fun in that silly, mystery-thriller kind of way.Just prepare yourself to suspend your disbelief.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'i never thought it was possible for a thriller book to be corny until this. everyone is so fucking dumb and brooke cannot think for herself! first of all, if she really is traumatized and reacts badly from even the small details, why doesnt seeing shane scare tf out of her and even being in the town where it all happened ? shes so stupid and she gives me that pick me girl vibes. also how tf is josh, a 10 year old who showed no comprehension of anything and acts and is being treated like a 5 year old, able to kill a grown man? that’s so farfetched it’s corny. i was going to give this book a higher rating when brooke thought tim was on it and i liked that idea. then she was wrong like brooke u only had one job ! and wtf is i lope you?'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Sit To Bum, DOWN! 😳😯🤯😯🤯🤯Son of a hot biscuit!

What Brooke failed to disclose when applying for the job, is that her ex childhood sweetheart, Shane Nelson is serving a lifelong sentence at the prison and she is responsible for his conviction. The story is told in dual timelines, flashing back to the night of the murders and the current tense.This book is riddled with red flags, but the one thing about Freida's books is, the twist is never the obvious choice. The red herrings made me second guess myself constantly and while I did predict part of the story, the epilogue had my jaw on the floor 🤯 I did not see that coming at all.The only reason my rating isn't higher is because I didn't care for the FMC. She consistently made terrible decisions and was delusional. Every time she was told not to do something or given a warning, she did the opposite. Especially when something suspicious would happen, her inner monologue justifying it was senseless.I understand the nature of thrillers, but it's just frustrating when the female lead is portrayed as daft. I found myself yelling at various points based on some of her decisions. Sometimes I found her decisions humorous (like her lack of self awareness when the murders were taking place) but overall, she just got on my nerves.Despite this, I was invested in the story and it was a fun, fast pace read.

Queen of Shadows (Throne of Glass, #4)
",Sarah J. Maas,4.61,1024640,268609,"Young Adult, Romance, Fae, Fiction, Magic, Young Adult Fantasy, Fantasy",648,01-09-2015,"An alternative cover edition for this ISBN can be foundhere.Everyone Celaena Sardothien loves has been taken from her. But she’s at last returned to the empire—for vengeance, to rescue her once-glorious kingdom, and to confront the shadows of her past…She has embraced her identity as Aelin Galathynius, Queen of Terrasen. But before she can reclaim her throne, she must fight.She will fight for her cousin, a warrior prepared to die for her. She will fight for her friend, a young man trapped in an unspeakable prison. And she will fight for her people, enslaved to a brutal king and awaiting their lost queen’s triumphant return.The fourth volume in theNew York Timesbestselling series continues Celaena’s epic journey and builds to a passionate, agonizing crescendo that might just shatter her world.","[{'rating': 5, 'content': '“Maybe the world should burn.”Epicness.That\'s the only word I can think of to describeQueen of Shadowsin order to encompass its complexity and awesomeness, because while I lovedThrone of GlassandCrown of Midnightblew my mind away andHeir of Firebroke my heart into teensy tiny pieces, neither of those installments felt as grand as this one -- worlds collided, debts were paid and a queen rose to her glory.“Let’s go rattle the stars.”I\'m going to start by saying that I\'ve read it twice in a matter of days -- once devouring it cover-to-cover, fueled by that insatiable need to find out what the hell happens next (pulling an all-nighter, if I might add), and then simply to savor its cleverness, awed yet again at Sarah\'s ingenuity. But as I finished it for the second time, I realized something extremely important: QoS is a tribute to strong, tough heroines, main and secondary alike.“Please,” Lysandra said, waving a manicured hand, “you and I are nothing but wild beasts wearing human skins. Don’t even try to deny it.”You will be completely astonished with the unraveling of Aelin Ashryver Galathynius, because in reality you haven\'t exactly met her until now. You see, she\'s the same heroine we\'ve come to love during these past 3 (4) books and yet a different persona. Every trait of Celaena Sardothiens is magnified and combined in such a masterful way to create a unique character. She\'s still an arrogant, stubborn, brave and sassy young woman, but she undergoes a spectacular character-development into a cunning, determined and fierce queen. Aelin is completely in control and she makes a statement in bold capital letters that she doesn\'t buy any bullshit and that she\'s ready to reclaim back everything that was taken from her. And oh, boy, she does it in style.“I went too long without demanding retribution. I have no interest in forgiveness.”In addition to that, she has matured a long way and, for the first time, she shed her impulsiveness for being open-minded, calculating and often kind. Aelin managed (through those crushing sessions of healing from HoF) to lose some of her darkness and her real strength -- spiritual and physical alike -- finally shone in this installment, making me so proud of her at this point. And I\'d bet a good deal that Sam and Nehemia are freaking proud of her too.*sobs*“I miss you,” she said. “Every day, I miss you. And I wonder what you would have made of all this. Made of me. I think—I think you would have been a wonderful king. I think they would have liked you more than me, actually.” Her throat tightened. “I never told you—how I felt. But I loved you, and I think a part of me might always love you. Maybe you were my mate, and I never knew it. Maybe I’ll spend the rest of my life wondering about that. Maybe I’ll see you again in the Afterworld, and then I’ll know for sure. But until then … until then I’ll miss you, and I’ll wish you were here.”Now onto the next awesome woman and quite possibly my favorite character from this book: Manon Blackbeak. She was completely fabulous in a mind-boggling manner. I never would have expected her wonderful character-development: she is not all about discipline and obedience anymore. She starts wondering. She starts plotting. She starts taking a stand, slowly but surely, like Dorian did in CoM and later in HoF. She\'s gloriously wicked, but she\'s no evil and I utterly loved her. I cannot wait for when her defiance will leave the witches kneeling at her feet.And damn, when those two met?! Shots fired. Fireworks exploded. And badassery was brought to a whole new level. It was by far my favorite scene out of the whole novel, managing to exceed my expectations thousand fold -- they were deadly and powerful and so goddamn magnificent I was literally fangirling. The encounter in its entirety was astounding by starting out surprisingly and unfolding in an incredible way that only increased my adoration for both kick-ass chicks.“We are the masters of our own fates—we decide how to go forward.”The attention falls equally on some other ladies. Prepare to fall helplessly in love with Asterin. She\'s so strong and loyal and her story will move you to tears. We finally get reacquainted with Kaltain and she\'s not in a place full of flying unicorns and pink rainbows -- she\'s basically in her own hellhole. There were a few fascinating developments that transformed her into a worthy, lethal player. Nonetheless, her inner strength was awe-inspiring and I ended up regretting that we didn\'t get to know her better before. She was hands down amazing and she has my unwavering respect and admiration.“She did it for herself. To free herself. And she was entitled to. After what they did, she was entitled to rip the entire damn world to shreds.”This book allowed us to meet new kick-ass females: Lysandra, who was nothing short of amazing and surprising; Elide Lochan, who was determined and immensely brave; and Nesryn Faliq, who was simply awesome in every way. I loved and cheered for them all.And now let\'s fuss over the boys. Firstly, Chaol. His reunion with Aelin was all sorts of shit, no, this-can\'t-be-happening, and I was mad at him for his demeanor. With that being said, I can assure you he remained true to his character throughout the whole book, his loyal, selfless traits reminding me why I like him so much and his insecurities being in sync with his overall upbringing, legacy and priorities. With Dorian\'s safety being his ultimate goal, his desperation is just gut-wrenching.“Oath-breaker. Liar. Traitor. Chaol was all of those things now, but not to Dorian. Never to his true king.”Speaking of Dorian, my sweet, precious and innocent cinnamon roll. He killed me in this book. Killed me with his few and far between chapter POVs that had him in pure, unaltered agony and pain. Killed me with his loneliness, with his sense of being lost, with his acceptance that he\'ll drown in an ocean of misery and cold. And finally he killed me with his force to constantly fight back, with the desire to tear free of the monster inside him and with the protection he bestowed on his loved ones. He\'s done kneeling before others and he is forever changed, but wonderfully so. I loved loved loved him, even when he broke my heart.“I am going to destroy everything you love.”Aedion was undoubtedly a new favorite of mine. The fact that he\'s Aelin\'s male version is only a shade of his real personality -- he had me tearing up and smiling at the same time with his boundless love for his queen and his loyalty and sarcasm were a recipe for instant swooning. Oh, and his father? I went bazinga.“Behind them, across the hall, the dancers shattered their roses on the floor, and Aedion grinned at his queen as the entire world went to hell.”We meet again with the King of Assassins, Arobynn Hamel, and he did not disappoint with his cruel, scheming, controlling self. He was a ruthless bastard but the satisfaction I felt when the pupil outwitted the master was priceless. Bon voyage, you shameless asshole.“Tell me what I must do to atone; tell me to crawl over hot coals, to sleep on a bed of nails, to carve up my flesh. Say the word, and it is done. But let me care for you as I once did, before … before that madness poisoned my heart. Punish me, torture me, wreck me, but let me help you. Do this small thing for me—and let me lay the world at your feet.”Rowan Whitethorn is yet again a main focus of the book and I enjoyed everything about him. His devotion, his wisdom, his alpha-male intensity and not to mention the rare moments when he let emotions overtake him. Aelin\'s effect on him really brings out sides we haven\'t met before and the fact that he was, at times, sweet (yes, I\'m talking about the King of Stoicism) continues to blow me away.But the best part about these characters is not even themselves. Their intricate relationships are the real deal. TheBROMANCES ARE FLAWLESS-- Dorian and Chaol redefine friendship, Aedion and Rowan set the backbone of a brotherhood for ages, Aelin and Manon bring a delicious and unpredictable frenemy dynamic to the table and the queen regains female companionship through Lysandra. Aelin and Aedion are even more amazing then I ever would\'ve imagined and their reunion was all kinds of splendid (I was crying, goddamit) and the Thirteen prove again just how much of a family they can be. Besides these, the original trio crawl their way to being once again a marvelous team -- Dorian and Aelin is possibly the best thing ever, maybe only topped by Dorian and Chaol. Banter and kinship and support and dedication are all etched deeply in every single relationship, giving them an almost magical quality.“For her friends, for her family, she would gladly be a monster. For Rowan, for Dorian, for Nehemia, she would debase and degrade and ruin herself.”Now -- expect romance. The wowza kind. The slow-burning kind. The tension off the charts kind. One ship is sailing fast, folks, and it is steamy and romantic and snarky and just asdfghjkl. I\'m not saying who it is just in case you escaped the spoilers. There are new feelings on the horizon for a certain male and I hope it will come to fruition soon. And and and maybe I\'m a fool to hope or even bring it into discussion, but do I sense Dorian and Manon?!?BECAUSE I\'M DOWN FOR THAT, MAAS.All my talk about characters shows how incredibly balanced QoS is, because this book is very much plot orientated. So many twists coming from Arobynn and the Valg world and the rebel cause and bitch queen Maeve and the King and the Duke (turns out he\'s a key player) and I can\'t even. The Valg plotline is an endless well of terrifying territory and it seems that we\'ll venture further into their scary world. It\'s thrilling, jaw-dropping and fabulously written. The last 200 pages or so were a masterpiece, keeping you glued to the pages and at the edge of your seat, but the entire book is darker and bloodier than any of its prequels.“Elegant, feminine, and utterly wild. Warm, and steadfast—unbreakable, his queen.”QoS is not necessarily flawless. I have slight complaints -- like Rowan being a bit too soft sometimes and Dorian and Chaol not getting enough page time -- but they don\'t irk me because I got so much more awesomeness instead (all of the above + Abraxos and Fleetfoot, of course) and I am fully aware we can\'t have it all; it was almost a 700 pages book! My favorite still remains Heir of Fire though, with QoS and CoM not far behind, because that book broke me into pieces and did not apologize for it. However, QoS did with that phenomenal ending that had me smiling ear-to-ear and teary-eyed at its sheer perfection. It was like SJM personally apologized for every time I cried and sobbed and went crazy over her devastating story and gave me a solace of utter joy. Happiness is not a good enough word to describe what I was feeling at the dinner scene.Yet again, Sarah J. Maas pulled out the big guns and took over the fantasy genre with a gorgeous world, otherworldly characters and imaginative plot. She is my favorite author and, even though I\'m aware of her storytelling skills, she continues to bewilder me with each book she creates. I got literally everything I asked for (seriously, my initial ""demands"" can be foundhere), even the things I thought were impossible to come true. So thank you, SJM, for this outstanding book.“She was the heir of fire.She was fire, and light, and ash, and embers. She was Aelin Fireheart, and she bowed for no one and nothing, save the crown that was hers by blood and survival and triumph.”Queen of Shadowsis a breathtaking continuation to my favorite series -- a truly wild rollercoaster, brilliantly woven with plot twists and thrilling from beginning till end, and also an absolutely beautiful journey sprinkled with countless gut-wrenching moments. Enthralling, action-packed and heartwarming (yes, you read that right), this book deserves every praise known to humankind and I bow down to the queens in eternal awe -- Sarah and Aelin, you\'re both spectacular. Cannot wait to see what you have in store for us next.“What do I do?”She had to swallow before she said, “You light up the darkness.”ENJOY! <3P.S.:It pains me to see how a lot of people hate this book due to its main romance. I love Dorian to the moon and back and Doraelin is basically my OTP and for that I could\'ve downright hated CoM, QoS and especially HoF (miss you, Sorscha). Obviously, I didn\'t, because what a lot of fans fail to acknowledge is that we shouldn\'t get blinded by the shipping-war. I NEED them to take a step back and appreciate the glorious world Mass created, the ingenious plot and the ever-wonderful characters. Romance was never the main focus of these books, even if it sweetened the installments and gave us butterflies. After all, a choice was bound to happen sooner or later seeing we have such swoon-worthy males around our beloved heroine and need I remind you there are still 2 more books? Anything could change! Maybe everyone will die in the end -- would you prefer that instead of watching your ship sink? (Sarah, please don\'t get any ideas). Regardless, I\'ve said it times and times again -- as long as Aelin is happy, I\'m happy, and if that means Doraelin isn\'t endgame I\'m not going to bawl like a baby about it, because she deserves to have someone at her side and she deserves to choose whomever the hell she wants. Team Aelin forever.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'When my sister told me about an early review that promised really bad things happening to our favorite characters in this installment, I didn\'t care. I didn\'t actually think that was true; ItrustedSJMAAS. Butoh, dearnothing could have prepared me for what I was about to face the moment I picked up this damn book. With this review I\'m putting these book down and getting some needed rest. I think we all deserve it after dealing with Aelin and the author\'s bullshit, am I right?Now, let\'s get down to business.How to ruin a book series by adding absurd romantic subplots and destroying some characters for the sake of a ship: A novel by Sarah J. Maas.Prepare yourself for QUEEN OF BULLSHIT. This one was definitely my most anticipated book of 2015, and reading it was an absolute torture.I\'m outraged and sad and deeply disappointed that one of my favorites series is now such a piece of crap, but I\'m certain that I am done with SJM\'s work. What she did to this series--to its characters--is an insult to the readers. This is not a book--this is poorly written fanfiction of theThrone of Glassseries.(If you listen closely you can hear Sam and Nehimia yelling that they didn\'t die for this shit.)I\'m gonna miss you, Celaena Sardothien.The assassin we all loved was murdered. She was sassy, smart, badass and arrogant, but in this bookthe author turned her into a fucking fangirl, Aelin Galathynius. She did not only act out of character--she became dependant on a hot fae dude who\'s centuries older than her. SJMAAS failed at creating an empowering female character. Aelin Galathynius was a self inserted version of the author, a poor caricature of Celaena Sardothien.If you think that the way Aelin acts in this book is how a queen should be like, Wyrd help y\'all.Celaena would never hurt Dorian, yet Aelin was so eager about killing the Crown Prince who was posessed by a demon. She never stopped to think for a damn minute of what her actions would cause to the friends she loved. No--she was so obsessed with Rowan that everything else what pure background. While Chaol and Nesryn worked to free Dorian from his father, Aelin showed the city to her fae companion. She socialized with Lysandra, she wore dresses for Rowan, and she had dinner with her cousin and her new friends. And when they finally managed to rescue Dorian, Aelin had the audacity to tell him she had come back for him. BULLSHIT.She’d kill whoever was needed, whore herself, wreck herself, if it meant getting Aedion to safety.Remember when Celaena said to Dorian""I\'ll come back for you""? Yeah, me neither.Chaol Westfall deserved better than to be destroyed so I ship could happen.The author kept using the Nehemia card to make him look bad. Aelin blamed him for everything--leaving Dorian, having a part in Nehemia\'s death, working for the King of Adarlan and never killing him. But when he replied,“You do not get to blame me for that. For his actions.”But you do get to blame him for things that were out of his control, Aelin? Where\'s the damn logic.Chaol had run. He’d run, and Dorian had been left to been slaved by the collar.If he had stayed he would have been killed by now, and who would be trying to save Dorian? You? YOU, Aelin?! I thought so.And just to make it even more clear,You should have gotten Dorian and Sorscha out the day the king butchered those slaves.Did you learn nothing from Nehemia’s death?Did you somehow think you could win with your honor intact, without sacrificing something? You shouldn’t have left him; how could you let him face the king alone? How could you, how could you, how could you?Chaol had to endured this throughout the entire book. Damn, the entire series!He got the worst part. If I recall,Celaena never tried to kill the King, and she worked for him too.So, she\'s a freaking hypocrite for throwing those accusations to Chaol. SJM made Chaol feel sorry for himself, she made him see himself as a fool for trusting an assassing when HE GOT OVER IT A LONG TIME AGO!!No, Celaena Sardothien certainly did not exist anymore.That woman—the woman he had loved... Perhaps she’d drowned in the vast, ruthless sea between here and Wendlyn. Perhaps she’d died at the hands of the Valg princes.Or maybe he’d been a fool all this time, a fool to look at the lives she’d taken and blood she’d so irreverently spilled, and not be disgusted.I see what you\'re trying to do, SJMAAS. But I\'m no fool. I SEE U, VILLAIN.Chaol Westfall deserves better 2k15#CHAOLWESTFALLDEFENSESQUADI WILL ALWAYS SHIP CHAOLAENA.It\'s over. They\'re not endgame according to this damn book. But I still have my copy ofCrown of Midnightthat proves otherwise. SJMAAS changed her mind. She wroteCrown of Midnightwith an idea, and she changed it the moment Rowan showed up.Nesryn Falig was obviously used as a plot device.It seems like SJMAAS didn\'t want Chaol to end up alone.I can\'t buy anything written in this book.Chaol Westfall would blush whenever he saw the girls who used to wait for him at his morning runs. He was dedicated to his Prince and King, and yet the author created this poor excuse of him having a relationship with Nesryn Faliq even beforeThrone of Glassso he wouldn\'t mind seeing Aelin and Rowan together. THAT WAS PATHETIC.A faint sort of amusement shone in her dark eyes. The same sort of amusement that had been there last year whenever they would meet, at inns or in rooms above taverns or sometimes even up against the wall of an alley.Ok that sounds fake but ok.I think what bothers me most about QoS is thatthe sort of closure Celaena and Chaol had inHeir of Firewas thrown to the trash can.I was fine with them not being together anymore, but what they both did in this book felt completely out of place. They acted like kids--SJMAAS pitted them against each other. Reading it was like watching a dummy relationships reality show. And they not having feelings for each other?? I get it, they are over. But when Chaol got hurt Aelin didn\'t even look at him! And Chaol never cared about Rowan, either. (Actually, Chaol seemed startled by Rowan\'s beauty, just like everyone else who came across him.)Their past was was erased. Like it never happened.“It meant something to me. What you and I had. More than that, your friendship meant something to me. I never told you the truth about who I was because I couldn’t face that truth.I’m sorry if what I said to you on the docks that day—that I’d pick you—made you think I’d come back, and it would all be fixed.Things changed. I changed.”@ Sarah J. Maas, WAS THIS FUCKING NECESSARY?!!!!There was so little left of the guard she’d come to care for....Youchanged, not him.You remind me of what the world ought to be; what the world can be, she’d once said to Chaol. Her face burned. A girl had said those things; a girl so desperate to survive, to make it through each day, that\tshe hadn’t questioned why he served the true monster of their world.WHY ARE YOU LYING. STOP FUCKING LYING, WOMAN. STOP. LYING.Yes, she’d loved Sam—more than she’d ever loved anyone. Even Chaol.BITCH DON\'T MAKE ME SLAP YOU WITH MY COPY OF CoM.This part, though.Do you understand what it was like for us here? While you were off playing with magic, off gallivanting with your faerie prince, do you understand what happened to me—to Dorian?WHERE\'S THE LIE.#ChaolspeaksthetruthRowan/Aelin should have stayed platonic.InHeir of Firethey repeatedly told us that there was absolutely nothing romantic in their relationship, but in this book they acted like lovers in a erotic novel. It was pathetic.Rowan treated Celaena like hell in the previous book: he told her she was useless, that she would be better off dead; but nowthey\'re so suddenly in lovewith each other and it\'s all over their heads.And I wonder how they went from friends to lovers in such a small amount of time.Aelin would wear a dress with nothing underneath, and Rowan would take it as a huge turn on. She would freak out thinking too much about her incredibly handsome male partner that I wanted to punch my head against a wall.Several times.Their relationship is not healthy at all,SHE LITERALLY OWNS HIM.And every five seconds Aelin would come up with things like this:A chill fog had blanketed the world the night before, seeping in through every nook and cranny. Nestled under layers of quilts and down blankets,Aelin rolled over in bed and stretched a hand across the mattress, reaching lazily for the warm male body beside hers.I just hope it\'s a dead body.#sorrynotsorryAfter all that she had endured, after what she had overcome in Wendlyn, to return to this... She wished Rowan were beside her, wished she could smell his pine-and-snow scent and know that no matter what news Arobynn bore,no matter how it shattered her, the Fae warrior would be there to help put the pieces back together.That sounds like the typical""fix me, I\'m broken""plot we find in every NA book.I know Rowan is hot and has amazing fighting skills and his body\'s been formed by centuries of war and blah blah blah, but he acted like he was a member of Jersey Shore.Everything was an excuse for him to be shirtless.And the way he and Aedion acted around Aelin WAS THE MOST PATHETIC THING I\'VE EVER SEEN. It was like watching a pissing contest.Guys, Celaena made it through three damn books without you. I\'m pretty sure Aelin can take care of herself.BACK THE FUCK OFF.Everybody loved Aelin Galathynius.She was beautiful, she was sexy, she was lethal. Rowan and Aedion would fight over her. Arobynn would send her expensive gowns and perfumes. And she was definitely enjoying the attention.Celaena was arrogant, but Aelin reached a whole new level.She did not need the extra strength, speed, and agility of her Fae form to bring down her enemies.Whatever helps you sleep at night, honey.One of the few good things about this book was Dorian and Chaol\'s friendship (BrOTP af).At this point they\'re all I care about. I wouldn\'t mind if they get together and get married and have babies. They\'re the only two characters I dare save from this mess. Don\'t fight me on this.Everything—everything was for Dorian, for his friend. For himself, he had nothing left to lose. He was nothing more than a nameless oath-breaker, a liar, a traitor.I love how loyal to Dorian Chaol is. I love how he fought Aelin just to save his Prince. His King. I love how he always believed there was a chance to save him. But I wish they had had a moment at the end of the book, because that is what they deserved.Chaol left with Nesryn, and now Dorian is unprotected again. It just feels off.I would like to talk about Arobynn Hamel, because I thought of him as such a rich and interesting character.I hate that he was lowered to the point of being just another crazy fan of Aelin.In the short novels we got to see a bit about his creepy obsession with Celaena and how far he would go to have her. I believe his characterhad more things to offerthan just that. I was looking forward to reading the epic battle between the Greatest Assassin in Adarlan and the man who trained her, but that didn\'t happen. Arobynn was a huge threat, and killing him off so soon--without getting his potential to its fullest--was a pretty ugly decision, if you ask me. And what a way to kill the Assassin\'s King: while he\'s asleep, by Lysandra.Really, Sarah?! REALLY?!The King was another disappointment.The biggest villain, a monster, the man who had erased magic from the Kingdom.... asking for mercy. The whole being-possessed-by-a-demon plot would have worked out pretty well if only had been thought throught. Why? Because we barely got the King\'s pov. If you want me to believe he had been struggling with a dark force within him, you must let me know him first--dude, we didn\'t even know his freaking name!--otherwise I don\'t care about what happens to him at all.Having Lysandra, The King and Arobynn\'s POV\'s in the previous books would have made things a lot interesting and added more depth to the plot.But the author just included them in this book, and honestlythey felt more like mere excuses and subplots.And can we talk about these ridiculously long speeches?Manon Blackbeak, heir of the Blackbeak Witch-Clan, bearer of the blade Wind-Cleaver, rider of the wyvern Abraxos, and Wing Leader of the King of Adarlan’s aerial host, stared at the portly man sitting across the black glass table and kept her temper on a tight leash.She was fire, and light, and ash, and embers. She was Aelin\tFireheart, and\tshe bowed for no one and nothing, save the crown that was hers by blood and survival and triumph.Stop acting like you\'re both Daenerys Targaryen.If you go into my profile, you\'ll see that Sarah J. Maas has been removed from my list of favorite authors. I cannot believe in the poor excuses she made. Arobynn Hamel getting killed so easily even thoughNo one—not even the King of Adarlan—would be stupid enough to go after him(actual quote); The King of Adarlan being posessed by a demon all this time; Lysandra and Aelin suddenly being BFFs and sharing everything; Lysandra being a shape-shifter (how fucking convenient)... And Manon, I couldn\'t bring myself to care about this precious character. At All. I got some serious Manon/Dorian vibes, so I guess in the next book there\'ll be another romantic subplot. The King and his son had such an interesting plot, but sadly Aelin and Rowan\'s adventures were more important for the sake of the plot.SJMAAS lost me when she decided that Aelin would be ok with killing Dorian.So this is it.The most difficult part is that I now should seeCrown of Midnightas an standalone, because that book is a contradiction to everything I just read fromQueen of Shadows. A fanfic of her own series is what SJM wrote, and it pains me to see how my favorite characters were sacrificed over stupid subplots. It all ended in the second book, I\'m afraid. Well--it was good while it lasted, because I already gave up on these books._______________________________________________________Queen of Shadows, a summary:Aelin:Celaena Sardothien is dead, I\'m in charge now, and I\'ll burn everyone who dare say otherwise.Chaol:but WHAT ABOUT DORIANAelin:You left him!!

That I enjoyed the light, fluffyThrone of Glass. That I absolutely lovedCrown of Midnight. ThatHeir of Firewas a slow, plodding disappointment.Did I likeQueen of Shadowsmore than its predecessor?Yes.Do I think it\'s a fantastic book?No.Do I think you should read it? Well, it depends. It depends on whether you are committed enough to this series and these characters to read650 pages of just okay.This book is loooonnnng. I think - objectively - Maas has grown as a writer with every book, developing a complexity and density to her plot that wasn\'t there in the beginning. But I also think that a lot of the delicious goodness that made me sprint through pages in the first two books has been sucked out.Like other much-loved fantasy greats, her books have become more layered, with other characters, perspectives and side stories existing alongside Aelin/Celaena\'s story. Though, I personally don\'t care for many of these characters and I have to force myself not to skim-read through their chapters to get back to the main story.And, to be honest, a whole lot of this huge book (about two thirds) feels like set-up for what is going to happen. Which might be fine until you consider that it is 650 pages long (and really didn\'t need to be), which means there are about 400 pages of planning, angsting, conversation andobsessing over Aelin.Because that is really starting to get to me. We\'re about 2000 pages into this series and I honestly don\'t think I can take any more about how amazing Aelin/Celaena is. Everyone is in love with her. Everyone is in awe of her and her endless ability to do no wrong. Rowan sees her again and has to spend half a page going on about how stunning she is.And the badass speeches that are getting kind of old:She was fire, and light, and ash, and embers. She was Aelin Fireheart, and she bowed for no one and nothing, save the crown that was hers by blood and survival and triumph.The first one or two times this happened, I thought ""Hell yeah!"" but now I\'m just like ""Yeah, okay, I get it. She\'s freaking amazing.""My favourite thing about this book is Lysandra. Both what Maas has done with her characterization and the way she has developed the complex female friendship between her and Aelin.That was fantastic. But the romantic relationships have also turned sour, for me. My Chaol ship appears to have sunk and I find beautiful Rowan so boring - I have no interest in his relationship with Celaena or how good he is with his tongue.I will read on because I\'m too invested in this series to not know what happens, but I am resigned to the very likely probability that this series peaked atCrown of Midnight.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube|Pinterest'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Hey!

See you back here in a bit, I'll post the link when it's up!Initial reaction:I stayed up all night reading this, and these are the only coherent things I can say at this point:1. The women in this series are PHENOMENAL. Holy hell, I swear fealty to them until the end of my days.2. The new characters are fantastic! There is such complexity and poignancy in each of their stories, and I loved every single one of them, as well as what Aelin's interactions with them showed about her character.3. More descriptions of sleeping under a wyvern's wing, please. <34. I have issues with the way a couple of things are handled--most strongly and specifically, how poor Chaol is almost unrecognizable for most of this book. Even though I can accept misunderstandings, mistakes, differences of opinion, cross-purposes, and so on, it makes me so sad that his story arc seemed to be so diminished and dishonored.5. But the thing I didn't think I could be talked into, I'm actually totally on board with. I get why people might be upset byRowan and Aelin getting together, and maybe if there hadn't been so much previous back and forth with Dorian and Chaol, and if Chaol hadn't pretty much disavowed Aelin through most of this book, the new relationship would've been more palatable, but I'm pretty happy with the way the way the big change develops and is described in and of itself.6. This book also made me cry. Like gasping sobs in the middle of the night that I had to stifle so I wouldn't wake my husband. I teared up at several points, but the graveyard scene was the one where I just lost it.Sam still hurts my heart, so I was unbearably moved that his presence is so deeply felt in this book. I didn't expect it.*bawls all over again*7. Honestly,Dorian and Chaol should just get a room together.Also, the badass action scenes! Aelin! Her suit and weapons! The magic! MANON. And bathtub scenes, heeeey. More at some point when I'm not half-dead with lack of sleep.I went into this with a certain amount of dread, but much to my surprise, this is the book that has the happiest ending out of all of them.

And I mean it. Now, because I liked this one more than the rest of the other three I’ve read, I have to give it six stars, right? Problem: I don’t have six stars so it is going to get the five and deal with it.This book is a whole journey. And I would love to take you to that journey with me, but I am not even sure that I will be able to hit all the best touristic attractions of it. I’ll try though because it is worth it. Really.„(…) forgive a girl who had needed a captain to be her champion. But she was her own champion now.”I just love this powerful mind-set Aelin has in this book. She’s more focused, more determined and more mature than she’s ever been. She empowers herself and others. She knows that. And she knows that she has to be confident in order to make others believe in her. To make them confident.There is also a wave of strength and empowerment among all the characters. This, in my opinion, shows a positive character change, a growth that is wanted, needed and achievable.„I will keep getting back up, no matter how many times those butchers shove me down.”Also, apart from all this beautiful feeling of empowerment, there is a deep feeling ofloveandloyaltyin this book. And don’t tell me this type of feeling is not comforting and reassuring because I don’t believe you. Love is not only a singular thing; it can come in so many beautiful other ways and forms. And you know when you come across them. You sense them. And this book isfullof them.„She looked at them, at the three males who meant everything – more than everything. Then she smiled with every last shred of courage, of desperation, of hope for the glimmer of that glorious future.“Let’s go rattle the stars” ” .Aelin’s relationship with the other characters has developed a lot too. Giving the fact that she’s more mature and has a grown-up thinking now, her interactions with the other characters are changed in a remarkable way – her old friends are still her old friends and she’s ready to give them her friendship in exchange for their loyalty. Her new acquaintances though are caught off guard by the way this young queen feels appropriate to act around them.All I’d really like everyone to notice in this book (and then I leave y’all alone) is the character growth I was talking about earlier (yeah, I know I’ve repeated myself already but that is a very important track to follow throughout the book in order to notice its essence). And, I don’t know if this is coming from me or it is the whole idea of the book, but I think this character development is based on this level of love SJM has inserted in a fair amount. And the idea behind this is that everything that is made with love is becoming beautiful – it is growing and it is blooming. And even the darkest souls might have a secret desire of love somewhere hidden, even though it is hard to reach.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'reading this book feels like an ascension to some higher sphere.this installment is the key turning point in this series and it has absolutely sent me. the foresight, the cleverness, the complexity, the reach, the drive, the cunningness - all of it amounts to a story that transcends all other stories.it is, quite simply, a masterpiece.↠5 stars'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '”When you shatter the chains of this world and forge the next, remember that art is as vital as food to a kingdom.

To say it was better than its predecessors would probably be the understatement of the century so all I’ll say is that Sarah once again surpassed herself. <3There were so many new characters that got introduced during the book and I’m not lying when I say that I loved them all. XD I think one of the most amazing things about Sarah’s books is that she has so many awesome and strong heroines! They do what they want to do, they are brave, they dare to dream, they dare to hope and they always make their way! It’s just so amazing to read! =)))Of course not everything in“Queen of Shadows”is sunshine though and boy did it hit me with the feels sometimes! There were actually moments I was so frustrated that I felt like tearing the book apart (Don’t worry I did no such thing, I love my books too much to harm them. *lol*) and there were some chapters that killed me over and over again. I guess by now you all know which chapters I’m talking about. ;-)Well anyway, let’s not talk about the epic fights or the hopeful ending.WHAT a hopeful ending? YES!!!Jeez, I think this must be the first time I’m not destroyed after one of Sarah’s books. I’m actually h- … hopeful! I’m not licking my wounds or trying to deal with my emotions so knowing Sarah I have absolutely no doubt that she’s going to destroy me with“Empire of Storms”.Ladies and Gentleman, this is the quiet before the storm and I’m so not ready for it! XD Which is probably the main reason I’m writing this review. I’m trying to stall for time. *lol* #SorryNotSorryThe characters:Spoiler warning! My character section is so full of spoilers you won’t even have to read the book anymore. ;-P So if you still want to read this series and want to experience it all by yourself you better stop reading now! Don’t say I didn’t warn you! XDAelin:”How can I take away somebody who means the world to someone else? Even if she’s my enemy.”Boy, did I have mixed feelings about Aelin in this book! On the one hand I really loved her and could understand her decisions, but on the other hand all I wanted to do was to yell at her! *lol* I mean she sometimes really didn’t make it easy to like her in this book, knowing about her past and everything she’s been through I could see through her façade though. I mean it’s obvious she struggled with her new role as Queen and because of her insecurities and fears she sometimes made mistakes that got her into trouble. A crown is a heavy weight; I don’t blame her for not being perfect. Hell, I’m pretty sure I would have made plenty of mistakes as well. XD”But now that she was here … everything was an effort not to say she was sorry. Sorry not for what she’d done to his face, but for the fact that her heart was healed – still fractured in spots, but healed – and he … he was not in it. Not as he’d once been.”Chaol:”Magic has saved your life a few times now, if I recall correctly.”“Yes,” he breathed, “you and Dorian both – and I’m grateful, I am. But where are the checks against your kind? Iron? Not much of a deterrent, is it? Once magic is free, who is to stop the monsters from coming out again? Who is to stop you?”And here is my second problem child! Chaol! Jeez, he said quite some nasty stuff! I mean I know where he’s coming from and I understand that he worries for his people and kingdom; I’m not okay with what he said about magic though. Before you go all like: “Oh don’t you dare to say anything against my baby!” now *raises eyebrow and looks at Gem and J.* I’ll tell you that despite all this I actually still love him. *lol* He did the best he could do and he’s just human. Of course he is afraid of magic and what it might do to his kingdom. I mean in spite of being the former captain of the king’s guard he’s still young. I’m sure he can’t even remember the world with magic and it’s no surprise he’s afraid of it. If he proved anything over those last 4 books then it is that he’s able to learn and to change though. So yes, I have faith in him and I’m sure as long as he follows his heart, he’ll always do the right thing. Plus:WHY DID YOU HAVE TO HURT HIM LIKE THAT, SARAH?!I think Chaol suffered enough over those last few books and now this too?! Not fair. T_TDorian:”He deserved this darkness, and once the invisible boundary shattered and the waiting thing pounced, infiltrating and filling him … he’d have earned it.”MY PRECIOUS CINNAMON ROLL!!!*sobs* Gosh, how much did I suffer with him, how much did I weep for his shattered and broken soul. The pain he went through, the torture he had to endure. T_T Every chapter was another stab into my heart and by the end of the book I almost lost hope that he’d be free again. I thought he was going to die, that nothing would be left of him, but then, then he broke his chains and OMG did I cry when he finally escaped!!! Still, he’s so broken and lonely and I’m not sure how he’s going to deal with everything that happened to him. I’m so worried about Dorian and I really hope he’ll be able to find happiness!#TeamDorian forever and for always!!! <333”There were tears running down Aelin’s face as Dorian gripped the black stone encircling his throat. And bellowing his grief, his rage, his pain, he snapped the collar from his neck.””The sun would still rise and fall, the seasons would still change, heedless of whether he was free or enslaved, prince or king, heedless of who was alive and who was gone. The world would keep moving on. It didn’t seem right, somehow.”Manon:”I’m not in the habit of forcing my servants.”“Only slaughtering men like pigs, correct?”“Their deaths equate to their behavior in life,” Manon replied with a kind of calm that made Elide wonder whether she should start running.Ahh Manon! My sexy relentless, fierce and ruthless witch! I love her! She’s one of those characters I can’t help but adore! I know she isn’t really a heroine, but she certainly is no villain either. In fact she’s such a complex character that I just can’t get enough of her!I FREAKIN LOVE THIS WITCH!And I’m so damn glad she finally decided to do whatSHEthinks is right! YESH!!! Screw that old hag of a matron and do your thing Manon! Because you’re amazing and you could be so much more than just the monster others see in you! It’s time to disobey orders and to kick asses! Show them your iron fangs, baby! XD #GuessImTeamManonNowTooAsterin let out another joyless laugh. “You would not have disobeyed even if it had been Blackbeaks down there, would you? Loyalty, obedience, brutality – that is what you are.””Do you believe monsters are born, or made?”Rowan:”You will make mistakes. You will make decisions, and sometimes you will regret those choices. Sometimes there won’t be a right choice, just the best of several bad options. I don’t need to tell you that you can do this – you know you can. I wouldn’t have sworn the oath to you if I didn’t think you could.”I like Rowan but despite him becoming the main love interest for Aelin I still don’t love him as much as I love Dorian or Aedion. Hmm.. I dunno what it is but I think I’m kind of unhappy with his development. I mean in “Heir of Fire” he was this kickass, broody and fierce warrior that took no shit and now he’s almost become a purring kitty in Aelin’s arms. I mean I do get that he loves Aelin and would do everything for her, but I think his love for her made him less interesting somehow? Idk. It’s like he lost some part of himself now that he fell in love with his Queen and I really hope we’ll see the fierce warrior in “Empire of Storms” again. Please?Aedion:”Whatever you had to do to survive, whatever you did from spite or rage or selfishness … I don’t give a damn. You’re here – and you’re perfect. You always were, and you always will be.”AEDION IS MY CUPCAKE!Seriously I think he’s one of the cutest guys ever and he definitely deserves the world! I love how fiercely loyal he is and that he always tries to see the good in people. He never wavered and he always did the right thing, even if it hurt him and was at his own expense. Like for instance accepting that Aelin let Rowan take the oath and didn’t even mention it! Gosh darn it! Aedion deserved better than that! I’ll personally pull Aelin’s long fae ears if she ever hurts him like that again!! Also is Aedion bi? I mean he commented on Rowan being handsome so I think that actually might be a possibility! Just one more reason to love him! <333Lysandra:“No. And what kills me is that I can’t remember what my real face was. That was the danger of shifting – that you would forget your real form, because it’s the memory of it that guides the shifting. I remember being plain as a dormouse, but … I don’t remember if my eyes were blue or gray or green; I can’t remember the shape of my nose or my chin. And it was a child’s body, too. I don’t know what I would look like now, as a woman.”I’m in love with Lysandra too! *lol* Yes, I can’t help it! She’s such an awesome woman as well and she’s a hell of a fighter! Gosh did I love her comments! That girl brought so much life into Aelin’s court and I lived for her remarks. She always tried to appear nonchalant and bitchy but deep down within her there’s a heart of gold and by the end of the book even Aelin was able to see it. To think they were enemies and rivals once... I’m so glad they finally became friends. Plus: How cool is it that Lysandra is a shape shifter?!! I mean OMG!!! I didn’t expect that and I was so surprised when I found out. XD”The soldiers in the sewer were screaming as she tore into them – a death for every day in hell, a death for the childhood taken from her and from Evangeline. She was fury, she was wrath, she was vengeance.”Elide & Nesryn:”You told me Dorian would fix the world, make it better. Buf if he’s gone, if we made the mistake today in keeping him alive, then I will find another way to attain that future. And another one after that, if I have to. I will keep getting back up, no matter how many times those butchers shove me down.”- NesrynThose two were both strong women in their own way, but I feel like we didn’t get to see all too much of them. I just wish there would have been more scenes with Elide & Nesryn. I mean they both intrigued me and their characters sounded very interesting, in the end I don’t feel like I really got to know them though. *sigh* Well, there are so many characters in Sarah’s books, it’s no wonder some of them fall by the wayside. Let’s hope there will be more of them in Eos! ;-)Arobynn:”Sam had been tortured in ways she hadn’t even known until she read Wesley’s letter. The worst of it had been requested by Arobynn. Requested, as punishment for Sam’s loving her – punishment for tampering with Arobynn’s belongings.”That manipulative jerk eventually got what he deserved! But damn I wish it wouldn’t have happened the way it did in the end. To die in his sleep was a death too merciful for him. For all the horrible and atrocious things Arobynn did he should have at least been awake and aware of the fact that he died. I understand why Lysandra could only kill him in his sleep though. *sigh* My poor brave girl!The friendships & ships:Aelin & Chaol:For a heartbeat, she pitied him, and part of her wished she could say it more kindly, more compassionately. “There’s no getting Dorian out. There’s no saving him.”“Like hell there isn’t.”THOSE TWO!Gosh, they constantly seemed to be at each other’s throat and they frustrated me immensely! I hated that Aelin thought she couldn’t save Dorian and loved Chaol for never giving up on him, yet at the same time I disliked Chaol for calling Aelin a monster! I swear their anger and the way they treated each other had me all like:No, NO, NO! You’re supposed to help each other!! You’re supposed to save Dorian! Pull yourself together and work it out! GODDAMMIT!!!Thankfully by the end of the book both of them finally realized that they need each other and they eventually made amends. Jeez! It was about time! *sighs deeply* Urgh they were so stressful.”We do not look back, Chaol. It helps no one and nothing to look back. We can only go on.”There she was, that queen looking out at him, a hint of the ruler she was becoming. And it knocked the breath out of him, because it made him feel so strangely young – when she now seemed so old.Rowan & Aelin:”I could still probably braid this,” she mused. “Very teensy-tiny braids, so – “ He growled, but leaned back against the tub, his eyes closed. “You’re no better than a house cat,” she said, massaging his head. He let out a low noise in his throat that might very well have been a purr.Haha! I loved it when Rowan lost all common sense at seeing Aelin in a flimsy nightgown! *LOL* Such a mighty fae warrior and then he sees her like that and isn’t even capable to utter a single word. XD Fun times. ;-P Still, I really like their connection and that they are so close to each other, I kind of dislike the notion of Rowan disappearing as an individual though. I just hope that he’ll give her hell in “EoS” again. *lol* Because I lived for their easy banter and the fact that they always gave each other a run for their money! XD It would be boring if Rowan would end up as nothing more than the man at Aelin’s side.”I spent centuries wandering the world, from empires to kingdoms to wastelands, never settling, never stopping – not for one moment. I was always looking toward the horizon, always wondering what waited across the next ocean, over the next mountain. But I think … I think that whole time, all those centuries, I was just looking for you.”Manon & Dorian:He cocked his head. “I’ve never been with a witch.”Let her rip out his throat for that. End it.A row of iron fangs snapped down over her teeth as her smile grew. “I’ve been with plenty of men. You’re all the same. Taste the same.” She looked him over as if he were her next meal.“I dare you,” he managed to say.Her eyes narrowed, the gold like living embers. He’d never seen anyone so beautiful. This witch had been crafted from the darkness between the stars.I SHIP THEM SO HARD I CAN’T EVEN!!!! ADKFADSFASDJFKSDFJA!I love it that Manon was the only one who got that Dorian is still alive and I love that she was so drawn to him! And boy those two short conversations they had!THEY GAVE ME LIFE!!! I WANT MORE OF THEM!!Just more!! I want my fierce, ruthless witch and my precious cinnamon roll to be together!!! PLEASEEEEE!!!! *dies out of sheer excitement*”And through the darkness of his memories, through the pain and despair and terror he’d tried to forget, a name echoed in his head.”Manon & Asterin:”That wildness, that untamed fierceness … They weren’t born of a free heart, but of one that had known despair so complete that living brightly, living violently, was the only way to outrun it.”Asterin’s story broke my heart and I want her to be happy again!!! I hated it so much that they both were at odds with each other and that Asterin had to suffer so much even though she only wanted to help Manon. She loves her. It’s more than just obvious! As it seems Manon had to come a long way until she realized what truly matters, but I think now that she did, she’s finally ready to oppose her matron! I really can’t wait to seeTHATfight! XD”Things are changing,” Manon said.“Good,” Asterin said. “We’re immortals. Things should change, and often, or they’ll get boring.”Manon lifted her brows, and her Second grinnend. Manon shook her head and grinned back.Lysandra & Aedion:A strange, ever-changing female scent hit him, and Aedion found Lysandra leaning against the hallway door. Tears gleamed in her eyes even as she smiled.She gazed at the closed bedroom door, as if she could still see the prince and queen inside. “That,” she said, more to herself than to him. “That is what I am going to find one day.”“A gorgeous Fae warrior?” Aedion said, shifting a bit.Lysandra chuckled, wiping away her tears, and gave him a knowing look before walking away.Another ship I want to sail! I think Aedion and Lysandra would make such a great couple! *lol* Besides I’m sure Lysandra might actually be the only one who would be able to keep up with Aedion. Haha! I mean they tease each other so nicely and Aedion is even slightly unsettled when she’s turning into a ghost leopard which means he has a lot of respect for her and this is always important in a relationship! =) Let’s see if Aedion will be Lysandra’s gorgeous Fae warrior in ‘”Eos”! ;-PAelin & Dorian:”It is going to take a while. And it might never be right again. Buy you …” She gripped his hand, as if he hadn’t used those hands to hurt and maim, to stab her. “You will learn to face it, and to endure it. What happened, Dorian, was not your fault.”I still love their strong friendship, despite Aelin being willing to kill him of course. XD But I guess after meeting those Valg Princes at Wendlyn she was allowed to doubt his survival. Still, they both can change the world together and they are both so strong! I have faith in them and I’m sure if they help each other and stick together they can really shatter the chains of their world and make it right! =)Dorian & Chaol:”I didn’t realize I looked that bad,” Dorian said, his voice raw.He knew then – that the demon inside the prince was gone. Chaol wept.Dorian surged from the chair and dropped to his knees beside the bed. He grabbed Chaol’s hand, squeezing it as he pressed his brow against his. “You were dead,” the prince said, his voice breaking. “I thought you were dead.”Those two had me in tears at the end. T_T I was so happy they both found each other again!!! Their friendship went through so much in those last four books and now they are finally together! I love them and I admit it, I even kinda ship them. XD I mean hello, Chaol told Dorian that heloveshim! XD Can’t blame me for shipping them, can you?! ;-P Besides, it’s obvious they love each other. At least as friends they do. XDAll told I really loved“Queen of Shadows”and I can’t wait to get to book five! I’m sure Sarah will have a lot in store for us and I’m kinda scared to start it. As long as myprecious Gemcontinues this journey with me I shall be fine though! ;-P Thanks for reading this series with me! XD We just have to read two more books!!! Two more books Gem and we’ll be ready to read“Kingdom of Ash”. =)'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '01/28/16Everyone is lowering their 2-stars rating to one star, and tbh I completely agree, this is not worth two stars.***times I broke down and cried: 5times I screamed and cussed at the book: 38fucks I give about this series right now: 0Let’s start this review a bit different. Let’s think of an alternative title for it… how about… I don’t know…""HOW TO RUIN A CHARACTER AND HIS DEVELOPMENT THROUGH 3 MOTHERFUCKING BOOKS IN ONE BOOK"". Yep, that fits perfectly!This is not a proper review, it’s more of an incomprehensible rant with a lot of cursing.Those who saw my updates already know how torn I am about this book. It’s still so difficult for me to form an opinion, because this book was such a mix of an amazing plot-line and ass-kicking and just real bullshit.About the amazing plot-line, well, Sarah J. Maas comes up with the most mind-blowing plot-twists. The ass-kicking: well-choreographed fights and Aelin’s plans were just brilliant. And I love Sarah’s writing style, it kicks me right in the feels every damn time.Now, so far it sounds pretty good, right? You may ask, why the 2-stars-rating then?There’s one thing that ruined everything.The Chaol thing.First you have to know that I love Chaol with all my heart.#chaoldefensesquadFrom book one he was my favourite character and his development through the first three books just blew me away. He is definitely flawed, but who is not.So the way Sarah handled his character in QOS just broke my heart. She destroyed all his development in 60 pages. That’s right, she threw away all the work she put into him in less than 9% of the book.This just felt like such a slap in the face. The way she wrote Chaol in the first 70% was so out of character. It wasn’t even Chaol anymore, the Chaol I know and read about would never act the way he did.You may say that he’s Sarah’s character, she wrote him and probably knows him the best. Do I have any right to say he was out of characters? Maybe not. But I was madly obsessed with him from the start, over-analysed every word he said and action he made. I dare to say that I know him enough to say that QOS Chaol was just bullshit.Do I sound like a child throwing a tantrum? Maybe. But you know what? I. Don’t. Care.How could someone put so much effort into developing a character, and then just destroy him and waste all the potential?It makes no fucking sense. It’s stupid. So stupid.But there is an explanation, well, my explanation.Rowan.I already knew about Sarah’s obsession with Rowan; every interview I watched she ended up speaking about him and how hot he is. So often she didn’t even mention the other characters.I’m not complaining, he definitely is an interesting character and I like him.But when an author rewrites a character (Chaol) just to benefit another one (Rowan), I can’t help but feel betrayed.It was like the first two books didn’t even happen to Chaol, we started from zero again. And I’m just so angry.When the conversation at page 60 happened I just broke down and cried. I couldn’t believe that this was happening. This was not Chaol, not the guy who was ready to give up everything he worked for and ever believed in to send the girl he loves away to keep her safe.This was just a twisted version of him and honestly, I can’t believe Sarah actually came up with this.I FUCKING TRUSTED YOU.Chaol deserves so much better.And the worst thing is, there is no way back from this. No way to fix it. While Sarah did kind of tried to in the end, I still can’t forget this whole bullshit she put me, us Chaol fan, through. She just stabbed us and let us bleeding for some hours, then came back and gave us a band-aid for the wound.THAT WON’T FUCKING WORK.I’m also a Chaol/Aelin shipper. I’ve been since the first couple of chapters of TOG, still am after QOS and will probably always be.But I knew since HOF that they will not be endgame. And I came to terms with it. I was ready for them to end romantically, but I wasn’t expecting this shit.Here then comes the second problem, Rowan and Nesryn.Don’t hit me, but I shipped Aelin/Rowan after HOF. They made sense to me. But the way Sarah handled their relationship in QOS just weirded me out.Rowan’s POVs were sometimes… dumb. I can’t find the right word for it, but they made me roll my eyes so often. I still like him, but not as much as I did in HOF.I also didn’t like how fast their relationship progressed. Because in HOF they were just friends, it was one of my favourite platonic relationships, and then in QOS they went from 0 to 100. It was just too fast and kind of weird.Then Nesryn. Oh, how much I actually love her. She’s such a strong and amazing character. But the way she was introduced ruined it all. It was as if she was just there so Chaol would have someoneyes, she’s his new love interest.kill meto talk to. She didn\'t seem like a character who was planned from the start, but just thrown in when Sarah\'s startedruiningrewriting Chaol.There\'s something really wrong about how Sarah just cast him aside for Rowan. It\'s rude as fuck. It ruined the whole book for me, I couldn\'t enjoy the first 60% because of it. I mean, how could I, hewasis my favourite character.But there were definitely some parts I still loved about the book.a)Manon. Oh my god guys, her chapters were pure awesomeness. Sometimes they were way more interesting than Aelin\'s. Her plot-line in this book is just so captivating and I fell in love with her.b)Elide. Damn, her chapters kind of broke my heart but I admire her so much. I don\'t know about you but I love her so much.c)Dorian. My baby. I\'m so scared for you. His chapters were so twisted and dark, but I couldn\'t help but enjoy them.d)Lysandra. Such a cutie. I loved her relationship with Aelin. BROTP FOREVER.Here\'s the end of my rant. There are probably more things I wanted to talk about but can\'t think of right now.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'I am soimpressedwith this series.She was fire, and light, and ash, and embers. She was Aelin Fireheart, and she bowed for no one and nothing, save the crown that was hers by blood and survival and triumph.I honestly cannot remember the last time when aseries was so consistently good.It\'s the fourth book and yet the story and the characters feel as fresh as the first.Aelin Galathynius has returned and her life as Celaena Sardothien is a part of the past -or so she thought. Aelin must spend a few more weeks as Celaena the Assassin before she can take up the mantle as the Queen of Terrasen - or as others call her:“Fire-breathing bitch-queen.”She has quite a few people to save - her cousin is ondeath row,the prince istrapped withinhis own mind and every day more people arebeing executed.With tensions mounting on every side - will she be able to save anyone in time?Then she smiled with every last shred of courage, of desperation, of hope for the glimmer of that glorious future. “Let’s go rattle the stars.I absolutelyadored this book- the personal growth from Aelin and the other characters really cinched this novel for me.Aelin\'s changed so muchfrom the half-dead assassin in book 1 and every book she continues to grow more than I thought possible.I\'m also a huge fan ofManon and the Blackbeak witch-clan.I still don\'t know fully how much they will play a part in the series but every time I read their side, I\'m completely enraptured.Gah.

No words for this book. 95% love for this book, but the first 300 pages had issues I can\'t deny. But overall I just love love love how the plot developed!Full review:Check out my review @A Perfection Called Books**Spoilers from previous books. Slight QoS spoilers about romance.Throne of Glass has been one of my favorite series for a few years now, so I\'ve been impatiently waiting for Queen of Shadows and building the expectations to the highest degree. The fourth installment wowed me yet had some flaws I can\'t ignore.As much as I\'d like to blindly give myself over to the epicness of this series and say ""It was perfect, and everything was amazing"" I can\'t do that as a reviewer. Nor can I do that as a reader/person in general. I refuse to trick myself! Overall though, I have so many positive things to say about this book,and a few negative things to discuss.The PlotFirst let\'s start with the plot development. I bow down to Sarah J Maas and her brilliant plotting. I am astounded by all the ties and connections reaching so far back to The Assassin\'s Blade. There are lots of ah-ha and mind-blowing moments. Everything connects in some way, and Maas is a magnificent plotter. The pacing was a bit slow for the first 300 pages, but there\'s so much plot build-up and development that keeps us engaged. Maas\' writing has progressively matured into a beautiful story-telling talent. There\'s an ominous edge to it that perfectly matches the tone of the series. I feel this series is getting darker and darker; it\'s often pitched as a less promiscuous YA Game of Thrones. There are some bloody scenes, lots of death, and quite a bit of pain. Action is interspersed throughout the story too.The CharactersLet\'s talk about the characters! In Heir of Fire, I had a few issues with the various POV switches, but I thought the transitions were smoother in Queen of Shadows, and I actually like Manon and her story a bit more in this book. Elide is also introduced, and while her POV was my least favorite, her character is pretty tenacious and smart, so I can\'t wait to see where she goes next. Lysandra is re-introduced, and I love her sassy and snarky character. Nesyrn is a rebel who is part of the city guard. She\'s pretty stoic and strong-willed, and I like her! Aedion will always be a bright star with his unending devotion and loyalty to Aelin. Dorian\'s character and POVs were painful and sad to read. I love him and thought his tenacity and decisiveness were admirable.Squad assembled in this book, and I was so happy about that!! I love Aelin\'s court/group and seeing them all come together was definitely one of my favorite parts. Light banter and strong female friendships prevail, and I approve! Arobynn comes back into this novel and oh geez I forgot how cynical and ruthless he is. Sam has such a presence in this novel which was equal parts surprising, somber, and up-lifting.Let\'s talk about Rowan, Chaol, and Aelin. Such fun. While I loved all the other characters mentioned above, I had so much trouble with these three. Please don\'t stone me, but I\'m going to call BS and say these people were SO out of character for the first 300 pages. I liked Rowan a bit better in this book, but whoa has he changed. No longer is he the tight***, brutal and unemotional warrior. He\'s now reduced to a horny teenager who pines over Aelin. I failed to see many similarities between this Rowan and the one from HoF. Chaol, oh my sweet Chaol. Honorable Captain of the Guard, now disgraced and rebel-turned. His bitterness has reached his peak just as his character and his POV has been diminished. I still hold on to the hope he\'ll achieve redemption. Chaol has grown so much throughout this series, yet he still needs time to grow. He\'s used to his beliefs and blindly and honorably follows his king. Now that everything he knows and loves is being threatened and challenged, he\'s had to change, and not everyone reacts the same way to change. He\'s made progress!Aelin has turned malicious and bitter. I love how bad*** she is and how she fights for what she believes in, but I missed her sarcastic nature. I missed the girl who loved reading and dresses yet also loved to show people her girl power and how awesome she is. She lacked the confidence and humor I associate with her. Just because she and Celaena have different goals, I don\'t think that should mean her character takes a 180 turn. Most of all Aelin is highly hypocritical, especially towards Chaol. Aelin and Chaol are both mad at each other for both reasonable and unreasonable things. Personally I think they were both being hypocritical as they slung insults and accusations at each other at their first meeting in QoS. I see faults on both sides, but I think they\'ll work through it eventually.The RomanceSpeaking of Aelin and Chaol, you\'ve probably heard about the romance news. I\'ll be honest, this ship is sunk and blasted to smithereens. They want and need different things, and it would never work out. It twinges my heart and makes me wonder about the so-called significance of the words exchanged on Crown of Midnight. Some things literally do NOT make sense. Aelin even says something to the effect of ""Even though I said I\'d always pick you, I didn\'t mean I\'d actually always pick you."" I feel like books 1 and 2 were so insignificance and fake now in regards to the romance. I think it\'s fresh and unique to see how realistic the portrayal of falling into and out of love is, but it still hurts. I feel like we were led on in Crown of Midnight, and you can\'t deny all the words they said to each other.Jumping to the romance, I do not understand it nor will I get on board with it. I\'m not being a stubborn Chaolaena shipper (okay maybe a little bit), but I fail to see Rowaelin in the long run. Rowan is the type of guy Aelin needs right now. I just don\'t understand how things progressed from Heir of Fire as a platonic friendship to a lusty and yearning attachment in Queen of Shadows. I feel like I missed an extra novella or something. Rowan had his one true mate AND is three hundred years old. This romance does not compute. That being said, there actually isn\'t much romance in this book, it\'s more promises to come in the next book.As Cait from Paper Fury pointed out, there are so many conveniences in the romance department. Nesryn will take Celaena\'s place in Chaol\'s heart, so Aelin and Rowan can be happy together, and everything is all sparkly rainbows and wonderful now. I feel like this is such an easy way out. The Chaolin breakup was brutal, and I\'m sad to see how it wrecked their friendship too.The last 150 pages of the book are insanely epic and wonderful. The characters grow into their own a bit more as well.Overall the amazing plot, squad assemblage, and writing make this book wonderful while the romance and earlier portrayal of the characters sorely disappointed and confused me.Update 5/22/15Queen of Shadows is 672 pages long. *sinks in*OH MY GOSH I AM SO FREAKING EXCITED!!!!!!!!Update 3/10/14LOOK AT THIS BEAUTIFUL COVERAhhh, she\'s so badass!!

THIS BOOK. I'm so conflicted, I hated half of the things that happened but loved the other half! I was going to let myself give it 5 stars just for the AWESOME ending (overall the whole second part of the book was AMAZING), but the first part was unbearable! I believe it took me one week to finish it, while the second part I read it only in one day because OMGITWASSOAMAZING and I couldn't stop. BUT YES, the first part: BORING and ANNOYING. There are so many pages in this book and I don't feel they were necessary, also, I wanted to punch everyone.Another thing that I hated was what SJM did to my babies: CHAOL AND DORIAN. Especially to Chaol, he was so OoC most of the time! AND YES, I was a Chaolena shipper, (WAS, because that ship SUNK in this book and I'm so mad and sad and torn), but I wouldn't be as mad if SJM hadn't RUINED the character. She also ruined Chaolena's dynamics, she made them almost hate each other! At the end of the book everything is kinda better between them, but it will never be the same. So goodbye to my beautiful ship. Chaol didn't deserve what SJM did to him. And about Dorian... he wasn't in enough pages of this book. He was barely there (OH BUT AT THE END HE WAS SO AWESOME, I LOVE HIM SO MUCH).I'm not really fond of the whole Rowan/Aelin thing. I MEAN, I love Rowan, I really do! But what I liked about them was their friendship! It's really hard to find something like that in a YA book and I loved it, BUT THEN in this book they are suddenly all in love with each other, it doesn't make any sense! I can accept them together, I know I can, but SJM could have done a better job in making them fall in love with each other slowly, so WE the readers could notice the change! It was so abrupt! And I was so tired of hearing them saying how stunning and perfect the other was. Bleh. And tbh, they mostly wanted to undress each other in every scene they had together.SO... SHIPS I'M NOT ON BOARD:- Rowan/Aelin: I think they can convince me, but right now I'm a little icky towards them.- Chaol/Nesryn: I like Nesryn as a character, but SJM just put her in the book so Chaol could have a new couple, and it felt forced.MY NEW SHIPS:- Dorian/Manon: OOPS, am I the only one who ships them!? I mean, they surely can become a thing! The few encounters they had were some of the best parts of the book! And Dorian remembers her and FKDKDKGKGA. I don't wanna say much because SPOILERS, but yes, Dorian and Manon would be a powerful and really interesting couple.- Dorian/Chaol: YES I SHIP THEM. Can they get married, like, right now?And yeah... that's basically it. I just want to say that I absolutely LOVED the second part of the book. I couldn't stop reading! Dorian, Manon and Aelin are my heroes! GO, them!...EDIT: Just to add the thing I hate the most about this series! I absolutely HATE that EVERYONE IS SO IN LOVE WITH AELIN. Not just in this book, but in the WHOLE SERIES! Since book one! Sam, Chaol, Dorian, Arobynn, Aedeon, Rowan, even Lysandra... at some point of the series they have marveled at how stunning and beautiful and amazing Celaena/Aelin is, and I can't stand it! I mean, yeah she's awesome, I get it, but it's so unrealistic. Every male she befriends has to fall in love with her :/.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Everyone was off their rocker the first half of this book.

I lost two nights' sleep and I forgot to eat because I was sucked in Erilea, sucked in battles and plots and plans that went wrong and sacrifices and generalbadassery. An emotional roller coaster, a wild ride, an incredibly vivid and captivating book. That's what we callhigh fantasypeople.The charactersI can't help but admire Sarah's characters. It's true, Celaena is not someone I can relate to nor agree with, and I found myself scolding her for her decisions and cringing at her cruelty, but at the same time I felt a wave of pride for what she's achieved and the way she has grown up. And the rest of the women oh.my.god!! I freaking love Manon, my brilliant bloodthirsty witch, and Lysandra and Nesryn, they're the embodiment of strength and courage!

Every time a story full of pain was revealed, my heart broke.But then Aedion would say something funny and I would be likeThe romanceLet me make something clear. The new ship?Ahoy mates, I'm on board!BUT, I didn't like the way Sarah handled the Chaol/Celaena relationship. I actually felt bad for Chaol and thought that he was right most of the times he and Celaena argued. They all have changed, him and Celaena (and Dorian for that matter), they're not the people we met in the first book, and that's expected. I just wish some changes were smoother.However, this book wasepic. Period. The different storylines were knit together perfectly, and the last 100 pages gave me goosebumps.

So so SO good!'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '""Welcome to the Blackbeaks.""This series keeps surprising me. I loved how improved the third books was, but this fourth books was well beyond my wildest expectations. Plot, world building, character development, adventure, humor, politics, and anything else you could think of, each reaches a near perfect level in Queen of Shadows. As always, the first half build-up leads to a thrilling second half, that felt more like the final book of a series, than one of the middle installments. I\'m having a hard time imagining remaining ones surpassing this book: Maas does everything correctly here. If you\'re one of many who gave up on this series because of the first two books, you are missing out on an amazing journey.""Celaena Sardothien doesn\'t exist anymore.""While we still have most of the original gang, the author keeps on introducing new, interesting characters with each book. And the best thing is, all these new characters are turning out to be even better than the main ones. Manon and Rowan quickly replaced everyone else as my favorites by the end of this book, and I\'m really hoping Maas would not kill them off in near future. When she must have chaos -which would be inevitable in next three books- I\'m willing to loose one of the older main characters instead of those two. But I might be getting ahead of myself.Plot-wise, there\'s a lot happening here. Pretty much all the loose threads are tied up by the end of this book. If it wasn\'t for a couple of major bad guys remaining, it\'s easier to imagine this book turning out to be the end of the series. The last quarter was so eventful, and unpredictable, leading up to probably the best ending I\'ve encountered in this series so far. I\'m also finding those adventure elements to be quite enjoyable, adding a nice bit of variety to the usual flow with politics, scheming and romance.""Backs straight, shoulders back, necks uplifted. You are light you are air, you are grace.""It\'s not easy to give a \'right\' ending to a book like this. If everything goes perfectly, you end up making the ending unrealistic, or make things go very badly by killing some of the good guys, you end up depressing and disappointing a lot of readers. Even though the ending here was a little towards the former, I liked how things turned out at the end. It\'s really nice of Maas to maintain a perfect balance between victory and defeat without major causalities to the good guys. Though, it\'s possible that this might be the only happy ending we\'ll have for a while. 4.5 stars. I\'m loving this series!""And at long last, Aelin Ashryver Galathynius was home.""'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""I'm removing my review and writing a new one, because since I've started this reread, BOY have my feelings changed!""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I loved this book. The books in this series just seem to get bigger and better. This book is 600 + pages, but every page is good and well done. My only complaint is that I would have like more details about the fights, more blow for blow account not that ""they were already carrion, when she drew her blades"". True, this would probably take the page count well into the 1000s, but I would not mind if it was well written as the rest of the book. I have always been a fan of Sarah J Maas\' ""chunking"" writing style, where she makes some chapters longer as events dictate in some cases half a page for a side event constitutes a chapter.The last book Celaena\'s true name and heritage was revealed in this book to reflect this she is referred to as Aelin rather than Celaena, the book also introduced a new character and Manon of the Iron Teeth witches. She and her coven are continued to be developed in this book. For this development and even by the end of the book, we are not sure which way she will turn. Many of the characters of the novellas or the collected counterpart Assassin\'s Blade paperback. The fallout from there is death within the first half of this book. The body count is higher in this book, but there are not as many fights described. What this book does display is Celaena/Aelin\'s tactical and planning precision yes she can be a hellcat and a hot head, but as wild as she get she is a disciplined and dangerous fighter always thinking a couple of moves ahead. There is a great cat and mouse game between Aelin and her former master.Aelin returns to Adarlan she finds it an even more brutal place than before. Along with her own vengeance, she must deal with the fallout from the months she has been missing, one disadvantage is all the training she did to hone her powers in the last book, is lost as magic does not work in Adarlan. However, her physical training is still useful and has made her even more formidable. She has embraced her heritage of the Queen (I have to say I love the title of the ""Fire breathing bitch Queen""), now she must assemble her court. This is big book with big time ramifications and revelations. All in all great.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '""Do you think monsters are born or made?""I just... I just... I can\'t... I just don\'t know what to say. Celaena is coming for everything they said she couldn\'t have.Game of ThronesmeetsBatman. That\'s what theThrone of Glassseries is... and yes it\'s as epic as that sounds. Sarah J. does it again. Another stunning build of a book. This review is going to be so hard to write. I want to gush. I want to scream. I want to rage about this book, but can\'t because *sigh* spoilers. As much as I want to spoil this for you I wont. I will still write my feelings about it and highlight a few moments I loved, but I just wanted to give warning this review WONT have spoilers in it... I will say that if you haven\'t taken the time to read this series you\'re a fool and I have no idea what you\'re doing with your life, besides living it wrong!Queen of Shadowspicks up right whereHeir of Fireleft off; pulling us behind a car by our heartstrings. There are a lot of characters introduced and finally produced in this book that I unfortunately wont be able to touch base on in this review. Just understand that the smallest player can end up playing the biggest part. Anyways, I\'ll just jump right into our main players. First off lets talk about Dorian. God, I love him in this book (If you\'ve read QOS you probably read that sentence and thought I was insane but I don\'t care). I absolutely loved reading from his point of view. The complete change from light to dark had me drawn in. He became such a stellar character in this novel. He is a true wild card at this point in time. Then there\'s Choal. I know people love Choal. That in the previous books everyone has been ""team Choal this"" ""team Choal that"", however if you know or have read any of my review for this series then you know I have not been team Choal---or even team Dorian. Choal does give us a ton of character development and growth in this book, and I love his character but he\'s still not one of my favorites in this series. Then we have a ""newer"" player, \n  Aedion\n... Love him. His sass, his loyalty, his personality shine so bright in this book. I just couldn\'t get enough of him. And the growing bromance between him and Rowan had me dying. This leads me too the two people I\'ve been dying ta get ta....Yes, Rowan and Celaena. I know that Celaena officially goes by Aelin in this book, but I\'m going to warn you now that I will probably always call her Celaena or ""C"". These two... OMG. THESE TWO KILL ME!!!!!!I haven\'t shipped a ship this hard in the longest and it has me all sorts of giddy.Again if you\'ve read my review in the past then you know whose team I\'ve always been on... Team Rowan. From the moment this man was introduced it was signed, sealed, delivered.I LOVE HIM!!!! Good gods I love him.Though we got a good deal of him inHOFit isn\'t even half of what we get out of him in this book. We get to see into his brain. We get to see how he is feeling, he\'s stages of thinking, and his feeling towards Celaena in a way we haven\'t been able to in the past. It has be swooning all over the place. Everything he does and says will win you over. He was already on myfavorite fictional guyslist but lets just say after reading this he has defeintely moved up on the list. I can\'t wait to see where their bond takes them.It\'s refreshing to have a character in this series that generally understands her struggles and the weight that has been put on her shoulders. Lastly we have Celaena.I have said it on many many occasions that Celaena is my all time favorite female character.Queen of Shadowsjust further justified this for me.She is one cunning, whip smart, silver tongued, bad-ass bitch.QOSby far gives the best description I\'ve ever heard of her...""A storm given flesh.""That sentence is so spot on it isn\'t even real. InQOSya girl is taking no prisoners. No seriously, If Celaena was in aGOThouse she would be a freaking Lannister... and yall know why... Because a Sardothien always pays her debts.I can\'t even count how many times I screamed ""OH MY GOD"" over something she did. At one point in time this was my goodreads status update...""Seriously????!!? Did C just drop the mic??? UH YEAH SHE DID!! Seriouslyjust screamed ""oooooooooooh damn"" and scared the crap out of my dog.She just such a badass""... Everything she does is so calculated that when you finally see all the pieces come together you\'ll be exploding.Your brain will have to take several cold showers to get over the mind rape she will do to you.If there was something you wanted from C that you didn\'t get in the past you\'ll get it in this one. She gives you a side of her we haven\'t seen. This raw real emotion that takes her character to a whole new level. Celaena\'s character in this novel had me bowing down to the real Queen that is Sarah J Maas. *Insert slow clap*. Bravo! Thank you for making a character that is the epitome of strong leading female. Yes Celanea might go a little stray cray here and there, but God... She might want a man but she doesn\'t need one. She can do bad all by herself. Sarah continued to show that you can be tough but still love the things you want. You can wield a sword but still love dresses. That you can be all these strong willed tough as nails things, but still love deep. There\'s no other word to describe Celanea\'s character besides amazing. As for the characters I couldn\'t mention, they truly hold their own in this book. One surprise after another. There is one certain witch in particular that I can\'t wait to see in the next book.I know I talked a lot about the characters and not so much about the plot. Again that is only because we are now four books deep people.QOSis the perfect balance of action packed scenes, romance, fighting, plotting, and build up. This is basically me the whole time... Page 1-170 I thank Maas for giving me everything back. Page 181 I die. Page 295 I freak the f out! Page 319 I cry my eyes out. Paged 320 I curl up in a ball and die again. 370 I realize that if my heart wasn\'t stolen by C before it\'s was officially taken. Page 400-656 I don\'t breathe and can\'t feel my body. I cry. I swoon. I die again and didn\'t even know that was physically possible. Swoon some more. Then do my final freak out. This is all without even mentioning the crazy plot twists that happen. They sneak up on you and tear your heart and eyes both out. Sometimes at the same time. And that ending, though a lot of lose ends are taken care of it still has me so conflicted. I just don\'t know where this story is headed. My heart is telling me it going to go one place while my head tells me to expect another.The whole ending plays out just like a movie. So vivid you can see and feel the whole thing. Just phenomenal.Queen of Shadowswas well worth the wait and hanging around till the next book comes out might just do me in. Don\'t even get me start on how we still get at least two more books! Sarah J. Maas continues to surprise me with a series I never even thought I would like, but has turned out to be one of my favorites.All in allQueen of Shadowsis about finding your place in the world. Consuming what you must and then fighting for what you love. That you yourself can be your best friend or your worst enemy. That it isn\'t about how heavy the weight is but about how long you hold it. That you get to choose your future. That your past might have built you but that it doesn\'t have to define you. That one person can truly rattle the stars.originally read September 2015.Re-read August 2016'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""“what if we go on,” he said “only to more pain and despair? what if we go on, only to find a horrible end waiting for us?”[she] looked northward, as if she could see all the way to terrasen. “then it is not the end.”4.75 stars.(please forgive me in advance for this subpar review that i am writing with COVID brain. i swear only a third of my brain cells are currently working.)i believe this is my favorite book of the series yet?! the progression of this entire story is so addicting and i only become more obsessed with these books the more that i read.i am so thankful for this author for teaching me to not be afraid of series or intimidated by long books.becoming a fantasy girly has been the best thing for me as a reader,as i have never loved characters so deeply before. being so immersed in a different world and so attached to every single character is a special kind of magic. ��escapism at its absolute finest.✨this series continues to just get better to me as the story progresses. i love seeing the world, the characters, and the relationships evolve without being too dragged out. i've never had 600 page books feel so short before. sjm’s writing is one hell of a drug.admittedly, i have to say that i can now see why not everyone is a chaol girl…. i will not rescind my previous statements regarding chaol completely, but i can certainly understand everyone else now LOLspecial shoutout to my girl lysandra. i love her w my whole heart. rowan finally grew on me, too, and now my heart is tied up in too many characters and i feel like i’m going to get hurt.putting down any of these books to go back to living real life is always such a shame.onto the tandem read i go...she said softly, “you make me want to live… not survive; not exist.live.”❤️(i’m not crying – you’re crying)✼\u3000 ҉ \u3000✼\u3000 ҉ \u3000✼\u3000 ҉ \u3000✼\u3000 ҉ \u3000✼\u3000 ҉ \u3000✼\u3000 ҉ \u3000✼\u3000 ҉ \u3000✼all of my ToG reviews can be found here:1.the assassin’s blade2.throne of glass3.crown of midnight4.heir of fire5.queen of shadows6.empire of storms7.tower of dawn✼\u3000 ҉ \u3000✼\u3000 ҉ \u3000✼\u3000 ҉ \u3000✼\u3000 ҉ \u3000✼\u3000 ҉ \u3000✼\u3000 ҉ \u3000✼\u3000 ҉ \u3000✼""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '˗ˏˋ ★ ˎˊ˗ 𝓘𝓷𝓯𝓲𝓷𝓲𝓽𝔂 𝓢𝓽𝓪𝓻𝓼!! ˗ˏˋ ★ ˎˊ˗\'𝓢𝓱𝓮 𝓼𝓶𝓲𝓵𝓮𝓭 𝔀𝓲𝓽𝓱 𝓮𝓿𝓮𝓻𝔂 𝓵𝓪𝓼𝓽 𝓼𝓱𝓻𝓮𝓭 𝓸𝓯 𝓬𝓸𝓾𝓻𝓪𝓰𝓮, 𝓸𝓯 𝓭𝓮𝓼𝓹𝓮𝓻𝓪𝓽𝓲𝓸𝓷, 𝓸𝓯 𝓱𝓸𝓹𝓮 𝓯𝓸𝓻 𝓽𝓱𝓮 𝓰𝓵𝓲𝓶𝓶𝓮𝓻 𝓸𝓯 𝓽𝓱𝓪𝓽 𝓰𝓵𝓸𝓻𝓲𝓸𝓾𝓼 𝓯𝓾𝓽𝓾𝓻𝓮. “𝓛𝓮𝓽’𝓼 𝓰𝓸 𝓻𝓪𝓽𝓽𝓵𝓮 𝓽𝓱𝓮 𝓼𝓽𝓪𝓻𝓼.""""𝚈𝚘𝚞 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝙸 𝚊𝚛𝚎 𝚗𝚘𝚝𝚑𝚒𝚗𝚐 𝚋𝚞𝚝 𝚠𝚒𝚕𝚍 𝚋𝚎𝚊𝚜𝚝𝚜 𝚠𝚎𝚊𝚛𝚒𝚗𝚐 𝚑𝚞𝚖𝚊𝚗 𝚜𝚔𝚒𝚗𝚜.”I\'m screaming, sobbing, crying, throwing up and jumping off a cliff!

It’s just a magnificent book filled with growth.In the books prior to this we\'re getting a few different point of views, as there are multiple things happening throughout Erilea.In this book, all of these different events start to blend together into one main story.

So sorry in advance because this is mainly just going to be a jumbled mess of me trying to put into words how much I loved this.*ANYTHING BELOW WILL NOT BE SPOILER FREE*You've been warned.Let's just dive into the list of things I love.1. Lysandra. HOLY SHIT. This bitch came out of nowhere and went from being one of my least favorite characters to one of my favorite. I LOVED that we got to learn more about her backstory and the fact that she even had a back story. She was everything I could have hoped for and more. Her friendship with Aelin was so fucking epic, and everything Aelin did for her seriously made me want to cry. She deserves it all. LYSANDRA IS ONE BADASS BITCH. Not only did we learn why she hasn't paid off her debts BUT she's also a shapeshifter. When she saved Rowan and Aedion by shifting into a ghost leopard I flipped, like actually flipped and loved her EVEN MORE.Word to the wise, don't mess with Lysandra.2. Asterin's heart to heart with Manon. I knew that there was going to be SOMETHING going on with Asterin from the way she reacted to the witch covens being forced to produce demon babies. However, I was not quite expecting a backstory that deep. Manon's reaction to her story was even better, meaning that EoS is probably going to have some intense scenes with Manon and good ol' granny. SIGN ME THE F UP.3. When Aedion realized Aelin was in the castle and was in fact about to save him. My heart skipped a few beats.4. When Aelin visited Sam's grave. My heart did not skip a few beats and I'm pretty sure it almost stopped because of how hard I ugly cried. I actually woke my husband up that's how hard I cried.Whatever.Shoot me.5. Chaol. Soooooooo, here's the thing, Alana 100 pages deep in this book would have told Chaol to jump off a cliff. But, Alana 400,500, and 600 pages deep just wanted to hug him and tell him she still loves him and that it's all going to be okay. He grew on me so much throughout this book because of his character growth. And I loved that there was zero awkwardness between him and Aelin.Which leads us to #6.6. ROWAN.Need I say more?Probably not, but I will.My heart beats for Rowan and Aelin. They are it for me. First of all, the tension between the two of them left me fanning myself off. Or dumping a pitcher of cold water over my head like Rowan did ;). These two are EVERYTHING because they heal each other. They have both suffered insurmountable loss that most people would never recover from but together they are better.Rowan is ruthless, loyal, massive, brutal, and extremely aggressive. Above all though, he is a gentlemen. A GENTLEMEN. Who cannot handle a nightgown in the slightest, but still a gentleman.7. Manon vs. Aelin. EPICNESS to say the least. I CANNOT wait for more scenes between the two of them, because holy tempers, they are wild.8. Kaltain tricking the duke and burning down Morath. Another moment of pure epicness that left my mouth gaping for a good few hours. Just another badass woman in this story. Annnnd, let's not forget the little quest she sent Elide on. SO pumped for that.9. Chaol and Dorian reuniting. Queue the tears. When Chaol cried realizing Dorian was saved I'm pretty sure a piece of me died inside because I was so happy. The bromance is real my friends.10. The clock tower blowing up and ruining the castle.I imagine it looking a lil like this.And last but not least 11. Aelin setting foot back on Terrasen soil. THE BITCH DID IT. She really did it. I cannot wait for her reclaim her throne and bring hell to those who deserve it.“She was fire, and light, and ash, and embers. She was Aelin Fireheart, and she bowed for no one and nothing, save the crown that was hers by blood and survival and triumph.”YAAAAAAS, my queen!!!!! I cannot wait to see what EoS brings to the table.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""4.5 StarsDefinitely my favorite in the series so far...which surprised me what with how long it was and how long it took me to read it. I usually finish books I am loving within a day or two and this one took me almost a week.

I just love epic fantasies involving loyalty and character development/surprises and this book was rife with examples of both.The last 200 pages or so were especially awesome as the larger plot lines unfolded.

Her story arc is just astounding.To see her strength, which obviously has always been there, but to see it come out as she asserts herself and kicks some serious ass was absolutely satisfying.I loved hearing her backstory, learning her motivations and discovering her secrets. I can't wait to see where her story goes in the next book.And of course, Manon,my book-BFF, so fierce and such a powerful bringer of change. I worship her and pretty much every scene she's even remotely involved in gave meLIFE!I am very excited to get toEmpire of Stormsbut I am going to take some time before I start because I do not think I am emotionally ready to move on.

Lessons in Chemistry
",Bonnie Garmus,4.29,1488921,262461,"Fiction, Historical Fiction, Audiobook, Romance, Feminism, Historical, Book Club",404,31-03-2022,"Chemist Elizabeth Zott is not your average woman. In fact, Elizabeth Zott would be the first to point out that there is no such thing as an average woman. But it’s the early 1960s and her all-male team at Hastings Research Institute takes a very unscientific view of equality. Except for one: Calvin Evans; the lonely, brilliant, Nobel–prize nominated grudge-holder who falls in love with—of all things—her mind. True chemistry results.But like science, life is unpredictable. Which is why a few years later Elizabeth Zott finds herself not only a single mother, but the reluctant star of America’s most beloved cooking showSupper at Six. Elizabeth’s unusual approach to cooking (“combine one tablespoon acetic acid with a pinch of sodium chloride”) proves revolutionary. But as her following grows, not everyone is happy. Because as it turns out, Elizabeth Zott isn’t just teaching women to cook. She’s daring them to change the status quo.Laugh-out-loud funny, shrewdly observant, and studded with a dazzling cast of supporting characters,Lessons in Chemistryis as original and vibrant as its protagonist.","[{'rating': 2, 'content': ""(I'd recommend reading Jan's review (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...), because it gets at a lot of the stuff I had an issue with in this book.)[plot spoilers]I had misgivings going into this, because its premise is 'one fierce woman in the 1960s uses her cooking show to teach the housewives of America what they're worth,' and that's a big white feminist fantasy red flag to me. Turns out, I was right, but oh my God I didn't know the half of it. This book is insane in ways that I couldn't even remotely predict from the premise.So this book centres on Elizabeth Zott, an impossibly intelligent woman with perfect 21st-century politics (also she's beautiful but she doesn't, like, care about that) who's been inexplicably plopped into a 1950s setting. She's a self-taught chemist, working on abiogenesis, which the book appears to think can low-key disprove religion (this book has a very weird relationship to religion - edgelord atheist vibes), but because it's the 1950s, she's forced out of her doctoral programme and undervalued at work. She strikes up a relationship with a powerful chemist who adores her, but he dies in an accident, leaving her unwed, pregnant and fired, doing consultation work so the men at her old lab can actually understand their results. Undeterred, she builds a lab at home, and ends up getting hired to a local cooking programme, which she converts into a serious scientific cooking programme that the housewives of America love because She Treats Them Like Adults.This all sounds relatively OK at first glance, but the tone is very off. This book is a mix of jaunty comedy and family drama, but there's a really graphic rape scene very early in the book, even though the spectre of rape is then played for laughs later because Elizabeth is All Powerful Now (another man pathetically waddles towards her with his trousers down, she pulls out a 14-inch knife and he has a heart attack on the spot). Structural misogyny is there enough to drive the book, but can also always be overcome through force of will or nicely timed plot conveniences. One of her viewers, a housewife with five kids, goes and becomes a doctor solely because Elizabeth is like 'yeah, sure, you can do that. Go take the tests.' Elizabeth literally says she's an atheist on air, pulls out a picture of Rosa Parks while chopping tomatoes, calls a sponsor 'poison', and this is depicted as causing a couple death threats and one half-baked bomb attempt, while her programme gets more and more popular. In 1960!So this book is a white liberal's dream: a woman blithely advocating gender and racial equality in a book with no characters of colour, where structural prejudice falls away if you're smart and correct and righteous enough. The instances of misogyny are all incredibly heavy-handed and didactic, with cartoonish misogynist men or silly unfeminist women who all say things like 'women should know their place' and 'blue is for boys and pink is for girls.' I hate, hate, hate how so many books right now treat their readers like they're idiots who don't know the absolute basics about history and context; at one point, Lessons in Chemistry actually says 'In the 1950s, abortion was out of the question.' As if we didn't know! Or couldn't be told in a less hamfisted way!But there's also one thing that ratchets up the ridiculous factor: the use of chemistry. God, the use of chemistry. I want to give this to a chemist so they choke to death on their own spit. To be clear, I'm not a pedant, or not too much of one - I don't care if literary fiction for nonspecialists is perfect on every point of chemistry. I care that its idea of a hyperintelligent chemist is one that says 'pass the sodium chloride' instead of 'pass the salt,' or sometimes calls water 'H2O', or calls vinegar 'acetic acid' (which is like calling orange juice 'citric acid', they're not the same thing), or says that they 'almost lost an atom in the isomerization process' while baking (what???). Madeline makes 'mud pies' by drawing 3.1415 in the mud. It's a very teenage nerd kind of approach, with an accompanying shot of the aforementioned edgelord atheism, and an instance of Elizabeth Publicly Owning a vegetarian by saying plants are also alive. In a couple of episodes of the programme, I glimpsed what a good implementation of the chemistry conceit might look like (the one with potato skin and glycoalkaloids was good), but too often it's cringe - particularly the extended metaphor around 'bonds' or the book's steadfast conviction that saying 'we had chemistry' is a deep and powerful statement.I'm not even going to get into the family drama that is technically kind of the core of the book, because it's convoluted and boring and appears to be there solely because there needs to be some resolution that isn't 'and the whole country became feminist. Hooray!'. But essentially, this book is entertaining (sometimes intentionally) but is also completely detached from any actual feminist politic, wilfully ignorant of class and race, hilariously inept vis-a-vis its central conceit, bludgeoningly unsubtle, and has independently rediscovered the fanfiction concept of the 'Mary Sue'. And it includes a dog that understands language and can talk to foetuses.P.S. Cambridge doesn't have rowing scholarships!""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '1.5 starsThe synopsis describes this book as “laugh out loud funny”, recommended for fans of Where’d You Go Bernadette and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.A female chemist in the ‘50s? Great! Count me in.BUT….I obviously read a different book.- this book should be shelved in the fantasy section. Seriously. It’s fantasy. Which is fine, but if I had known I would have skipped it. The switch between fantastical elements and serious ones gave me whiplash.- Funny? Within a few pages a woman is called a c*** twice, a brutal rape is described in detail, and there’s a suicide due to homophobia. Yeah, just hilarious.- I’m over quirky characters who behave as if they are on the spectrum. Why can’t we have a woman who is a brilliant chemist but isn’t naive, socially awkward, and clueless? Except when she’s not, usually in time to deliver another monologue.- the MC’s daughter is a genius who knew the periodic table as a preschooler and reads the Sound and the Fury at age 8. Of course she is. Very relatable.- Elizabeth’s views and actions were not consistent with the era. It’s as if a woman from 2022 time traveled back to the 1950s and then lectured everyone with lengthy monologues on social issues and women’s rights. I don’t need a lecture and I don’t need to be repeatedly hit over the head on relevant social issues. This book needed more showing, less telling.- the message is a worthy one. A woman ahead of her time in STEM who must fight the status quo in a male dominated world. But I think the message would have been stronger and more authentic if it had been realistic. There’s a lot of exaggeration and preposterous situations to drive a point home, which is not my favorite storytelling technique.- all the men, with one exception, were ugly and hateful misogynists. I’m weary of male-bashing in fiction.- Did I need to read details of a man who masturbates and flings pubic hairs across the room, leaving behind his sticky porn magazines for his wife to clean up? No I did not 🤮- Atheism vs Faith. The author mentions multiple times that this is a free country and we have a right to our beliefs. I 100% agree. But she apparently believes only atheists have a right to their beliefs. I’m no bible thumping extremist, but it’s offensive when religion and people of faith are portrayed only in derogatory terms, such as faith is “a simpleton’s recipe for prayers and beads” and a funeral service was “boring verse and preposterous prayers”. A minister muses that the problem with his job “was how many times he had to lie”. The ministers and priests were all child abusers, liars, and greedy crooks. Lay people of faith were all violent protestors and/or morons. The message repeatedly driven home throughout the book, ad nauseam? Atheism = good People of faith = bad.Believe me, if the author had portrayed atheists as all bad I would find it equally as offensive.Why is intolerance of beliefs/religion the last acceptable prejudice?- I’m weary of the argument of science vs religion. Sure there are extremists who deny science but the majority of people and religions do not believe they are mutually exclusive. There are plenty of religious scientists. Sigh….- Anachronisms. Subsidized child care in Sweden wasn’t enacted until 1975, although the MC refers to it in 1960. And was defunding the police a thing in the early 1950s? I think not.- certainly women have been, and are, discriminated against. I’m not denying that bias occurs but the exaggeration and preposterous events in the story hinders the message. I have a science degree. I took many college courses in STEM. I worked in a male dominated work culture. In this book every single man in a power position was a misogynist. Not realistic. Please stop it..- Also, we are given information at the end that suggests there was a valid reason Elizabeth wasn’t accepted in the doctoral program, that had nothing to do with her gender or an incident that happened early in the book. This confused me?! What was the message? 🤷🏻\u200d♀️No book is without merit. The positives:- I am not usually a fan of anthropomorphism but I loved the dog, Six-Thirty. By far he was my favorite character. And yay, he survives! 😍- the cooking show was cute* this was a buddy read with Marialyce and another book to throw on top of the 2022 disappointing reads category.* I received a digital copy for review via NetGalley. All opinions are my own'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I gave all of my votes to this book, both for the best debut and historical fiction categories, at the Goodreads Choice Awards. I\'m thrilled to find out that Barnes & Noble has chosen this brilliant work as the book of the year - it is highly deserved!Amazing news, my friends! This fantastic book has been adapted into a streaming series on Apple TV, starring Brie Larson as Elizabeth Zott and an outstanding cast crew including Lewis Pullman, Beau Bridges, Ana Naomi King, Kevin Sussman, Thomas Mann, Stephanie Koenig, and Patrick Walker. I cannot wait to binge-watch it!Okay, folks, I just finished the best book of 2022! Now I can relax knowing that I don\'t need to search for something better. No, wait, I lied. Not about finding the best book - this one is freaking amazing - but I will continue to search for exemplary fictions like this that can speak to my heart and soul at the same time! I give it five gazillion stars!I loved the author\'s extra-intelligent, dark, original sense of humor, and I fell in love with her characters. The story of Elizabeth brought out so many complex feelings: I laughed, I got angry, I cried, I sighed, I laughed again, and as soon as I finished the last chapter, I gave my ovation! This is an underrated secret gem! Don\'t you dare skip this book or let it sit in your TBR pile. Just read it!Let me give you a summary of the plot and introduce you to the characters:Elizabeth Zott: How can I express my feelings about this character? She\'s so unique, different, extraordinary, visionary, extremely quirky, odd, straightforward, honest, a real feminist, intelligent, intellectual, fighter, survivor, and a brilliant scientist who is brave enough to fight for her rights and her loved ones against mansplaining, inequality, abuse, and humiliation!In 1960, after her traumatic experience at UCLA, she starts working at the Hastings Research Institute, which is administered with a male workforce that ignores her enthusiasm and hard work. Only one person sees her and shows respect for her accomplishments: an aspiring, Nobel Prize-nominated, grudge-holder named Calvin Evans.The first time they met, he thought she was a secretary, and the second time they met, he vomited on her. There is nothing ordinary about their love story. They are soul mates. They are great minds alike. They are the quirkiest, most unconventional couple. They row together. They adopt the ugliest and most loyal, incredible dog and name him Six-Thirty. They were happy, even though Elizabeth rejected marrying him because she wanted to become an independent scientist without being acknowledged for her husband\'s contributions.But then...We fast-forward to see Elizabeth building a new life, raising her four-year-old, extra-smart, one-of-a-kind, sweetest girl named Mad Zott, helping their dog Six-Thirty improve his vocabulary skills, and most importantly, she\'s a TV star now! She teaches women to use chemistry not only in their kitchen but in their entire life to embrace change and challenges. She hosts the most eccentric cooking show called ""Supper at Six.""Her blunt and honest comments about marriage, religion, and society\'s norms will be considered rebellious and unconventional.Elizabeth is not alone. She has a 55-year-old, devoted neighbor named Harriet Sloane, who truly detests her husband. She has her supporting producer, Walter Pine, who believed in her enough to give her a chance on TV while raising his daughter by himself. Dr. Mason likes to row with her, stopping by to wash her dishes and check her out.But Mad thinks her mother is unhappy, and her homework to create a family tree pushes her to search for more information about her father\'s past. She has no idea that her search will uncover many long-kept secrets.Overall, this is the best book I have read lately! I fell in love with everything about this story and highly, extremely, and absolutely recommend it.bloginstagramfacebooktwitter'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""This book is mind-numbingly bad. I really do not see what everybody writing rave reviews are seeing. So, I'm a chemist and this main character is exactly the type of chemist that we make fun of - a pretentious snob that non-ironically calls household items by their scientific name and inserts their scientific knowledge into any conversation they have to assert how intelligent they are. There's a part where she criticizes a can of soup for having 'chemicals' in it, even though a chemist should know all food that exists is made of chemicals - that is literally how the world works, so on top of being an arrogant snot she is also an incorrect arrogant snot on multiple occasions.Another point I'd like to bring up as a chemist, Elizabeth Zott apparently has several PhDs worth of knowledge, on degrees that she didn't even do. Her passion apparently is abiogenesis, to which actual scientists dedicate their entire academic careers solely, yet she also knows food science (an entirely different course of study) and can also teach herself how to row solely by reading physics textbooks (another entirely different course of study). It must be where her ridiculous daughter got her ridiculous genes from - she enthusiastically reads Norman Mailer and Vladimir Nabokov at age 4. I mean, didn't we all? She also debates religion with a reverend, who converts to atheism. Again, relatable pre-school experiences we all experienced.I'm also fairly sick of women putting down other women in all aspects of life, and this is no exception. Almost every other woman in this story is presented as catty, conniving and simple-minded (because they all believe in God, which this book hammers in that only total airheads do) except for our main character because she's not like the other girls. She wears pants and talks about how Sweden has subsidized childcare (which didn't even exist in 1960 yet so I guess the author phoned in on the whole research aspect). There is also no mention of any characters of color in this story, but that doesn't stop the author from comparing being a housewife to SLAVERY and including the daughter reading about the Congo cannibals to other-ize people of African descent. Bear in mind, that this is marketed as a comedy book. So ha ha. Every male character is also a chauvinistic pig with no redeeming qualities, also always hysterical.I didn't even touch on the most offensive part of this novel. TW: the beginning features a graphic r*pe scene, so good thing they didn't bother including a content warning. 'A novel that sparks joy on every page' claims the dust jacket, I claim bullsh*t.In summary, there are no redeeming qualities about this book, except maybe that there was a dog in it.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Imagine if all men took women seriously . . .When you come across that perfect read, at what point do you realize? For me, it was from the very first page ofLessons in Chemistry.Honestly, who does Bonnie Garmus think she is, coming in here and writing a book that completely speaks to me? And on top of that, it's her debut. Well, just knock me over with a feather too while you're at it, why don't you!Elizabeth Zott is a chemist in the 1960s. The problem is, she is the only one who views herself that way. Her male colleagues cannot get past the fact that she's a woman, and treat her more as a secretary and doormat, acknowledging her only long enough to steal her work. That is, until Calvin Evans, another brilliant chemist, comes along and really sees all that she is capable of. But life is unexpected, and so a few years later, Elizabeth is somehow the host of a cooking show. But in her heart, she still desires to be truly seen as a chemist.You guys know how much I love strong female characters, and Elizabeth Zott is all that and more. She's fearless in the face of adversity, she stays true to herself, and she never lets others intimidate her into being less than all she can be. In other words, she is my hero.It's not just Elizabeth who warms my heart. This story has the most wonderful collection of supporting characters. They add so much color and spirit to the whole thing. I wanted to hug them all. And if you're an animal lover of any sort, just be ready to have your heart burst into a million ooey gooey pieces. In fact, Six-Thirty might just be my favorite literary dog of all time.The writing is so witty and brilliant. There's a zing to it that makes it feel zippy and wholly original. I couldn't stop laughing and I couldn't put it down. Usually I can't wait to reach the end of a book so I can check it off my long TBR and move onto the next. But I wanted this to go and go and never end. I tried to savor every moment, but I ended up devouring it.What an absolute delight this was, from the very first moment to the last. It possesses all the hallmarks of the very best stories. It made me laugh, feel, think, and wonder. It filled me with joy and buoyed my spirits. It gave me everything I wanted and everything I didn't even know to ask for.So many books come and go that often a true gem ends up buried in the deluge. Please don't let this one pass you by. Go read it.

I didn’t come away with the enthusiasm for this book like many other readers did.In my own life in ‘California’ - during the 50’s, 60’s….I was a Kinesiology major at UC Berkeley.I never felt like I was in a man’s world. My organic chemistry classes were grueling- but that wasn’t because I was a woman.In my experience— I never had a problem. I wasn’t sexually harassed — nobody put their hand up my skirt unless I wanted them to . I was never patted on the head or belittle for being less than.There was something ‘off-putting’ to me about this book —The protagonist -Elizabeth Zott - was as equally fatuous as intelligent.I found the dialogue often condescending….with overly exaggerated themes.The theme ‘righteous indignation’ stood out for me more than ‘authentic equality’.Plus…..the humor lost me completely.The science descriptions felt more ‘for show’ — an indulgent plot device to produce proof ofhigh levels of dopamine chemicals in the areas of love.I prefer what George Burns’ had to say about love:“Love is something like a backache, it doesn’t show up on any x-ray, but you know it’s there”.I wasn’t a champion for Elizabeth Zott,The emphasis of her being ahead of her day; a strong woman; or a groundbreaking woman felt false-hearted.Her bogus disposition was too fabricated for my taste.Most of the characters had that caricature type feeling; unscrupulous.Basically — the story wasn’t “zippy, zesty, or zotty” entertaining to me at all.Although I was overall underwhelmed, I did enjoy the authors notes - (my absolute favorite part) - she almost sold me on how groundbreaking her book was.Her enthusiasm had a contagious magnetism about her. I appreciated her passion for her excitement in writing this book —Congrats to Bonnie Garmus….she has a large audience who applaud her work sincerely.So —please don’t pass on this book - on my accounts -it just wasn’t my cuppa tea.Average, lukewarm, to indifferent.2.5 - rating up.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Sorry, but I don\'t get the hype.I found this mostly boring, to be honest. The book zips from really dark subjects like rape and abuse to light somewhat farcical subjects like teaching a dog English or Elizabeth becoming an amazing rower by studying physics (women can smart their way into being better than six foot athletic men at everything because saying they can\'t is sexist, yo)... and I struggled to find any of it compelling.Elizabeth was difficult to warm to --not because of her abrasive personality-- because she felt like a mouthpiece for 21st Century feminist monologues. This is supposed to be the 1950s? I just didn\'t buy it. All her rants are straight out of a modern day Smash the Patriarchy podcast.And it deserves a further eye roll for the fact that because she is all into science and logic and whatever, this means Elizabeth is also cold, robotic and devoid of emotion. Cos we all know you can\'t be a scientist AND have feelings. Maybe the author worried if she showed emotion we\'d find her toowomanly.I don\'t know what else to say. The reviews called it ""hilarious"", which I did not think it was. And also ""adorable"" which... what? On page rape, death, abuse, suicide and sexism... super cute.The book does sort of lighten up as it progresses, but it did not get any less boring.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'I could\'ve saved time and read a laundry list of cliches instead of reading this book.Lessons in Chemistry was rife with issues. A non-exhaustive list:🧪Elizabeth is a SCIENTIST in the 1950s but reads like someone time traveled back from 2022 just to spout feminist monologues at anyone within earshot!!!🧪Elizabeth is an elite rower on her very first day!!!! No need for any background in sports whatsoever!!! She can keep up with 6\'4"" men! Makes perfect sense bc......... feminism!! Keeping up with the boys!!! Etc!🧪Elizabeth is VERY SEXY. She neither knows nor cares that she is sexy, puts no effort into her appearance, but the author makes sure we know that she is The Hot One. bc she is smart AND sexy. Or something.🧪Elizabeth is a SCIENTIST, ergo she only thinks in LOGIC. She is actually a cyborg without feelings and without any idea of how human interactions work!! We know this based on how cringy every single interaction she has is!!!🧪Elizabeth uses aforementioned LOGIC to disprove religion!!!! Checkmate, theists everywhere!!!!! Elizabeth has cracked the case!!!!!Overall, extremely ridiculous and unrealistic. Next.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '***WINNER OF GOODREADS 2022 DEBUT FICTION AWARD, THIS ONE IS SPECIAL***This is one of the most unusual books I’ve read this year.Elizabeth Zott is not your average person. She’s a brilliant, highly trained scientist who hasn’t gotten farther along in the world of chemistry simply because she’s a woman. She is working at the Hastings Institute performing a job that she is completely over qualified for!Through some crazy, at times hilarious encounter, she meets Calvin Evans. He is a gangly sort of guy but also a brilliant scientist and well-known at the Hastings Institute. Calvin had an intense love for rowing, that’s why he accepted the job at this lowly Institute when he could have been doing research at any number of universities. He came to California for the nice weather and the ability to row all year long.Fast forward and Elizabeth has a daughter named Madeline, Mad for short. Elizabeth was trying to work as a scientist at a lab in her home. She is a consultant for scientists who need and want her help, but it’s not enough to provide for herself and her daughter.Half way through the book I was already completely into the story and the amazing characters! What a unique and multi-layered plot.For reasons you will discover she begins a very unique cooking show!!!! I love to see her fiery spirit and determination to get what she wants, to dress how she wants. She is determined to raise her child how she wants. All the while she knows that she’s doing things outside of the normal or “average” mother, although Elizabeth would tell you that scientifically there is no “average person”!!!!This novel is fresh and innovative with characters just flying off the pages. I loved her new acquaintance, Walter, who talked her into doing the 6 o’clock show. He wants entertainment and she wants science in this cooking show!!!!I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BOOK!!! I would like to give it more than 5*. I highly recommend this novel to EVERYONE, especially if you are a woman and have ever been looked down upon simply because you are female!!!I also wanted to add that there is a lot of humor in this book! And how could I forget “six thirty” the dog who know 600+ words! He is a narrator throughout the novel.JUST WAIT UNTIL YOU MEET HIM!!!!!!I received an ARC of this novel from the publisher through Edelweiss. It was my pleasure to read and review this title.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'This contains trigger warnings.*sigh* I wanted to like this, I really did, and based on the premise I should have.First of all this is described as ""laugh out loud"", it isn\'t. It\'s also described as being in the same vein as \'The Marvellous Mrs Maisel,\' it isn\'t.For something that is decribed as being hilarious, there was an awful lot of dark subject matter. While I understand that humour can be found in dark places etc, this wasn\'t it. The tone of the book was all over the place, like it didn\'t know what it wanted to be. It thought it was smarter and funnier than it was. I genuinely struggle to see what was so hilarious, I was mildly amused in some instances at most.During this \'hilarious\' story, there is a brutal rape in chapter 3, death of a spouse, implied paedaphilia, abuse, abandonment, bullying, a second sexual assault and sexism. Again, I don\'t have a problem with the subject matter, I do have a problem with the execution of the subjects and the marketing of the book.Elizabeth as a main character just isn\'t that likeable. I get that she is supposed to be super intelligent and \'quirky\' but she doesn\'t feel like a real person for much of the book, there is nothing to connect to. She also speaks like she is quoting from a textbook about sexism and feminism which does not feel genuine or organic. It felt more like the author was lecturing us. Also don\'t get me started about her daughter and how intelligent and advanced she was at a ridiculously young age. Of course she had a genius daughter. *eye roll*The cooking show doesn\'t come into play until at least half way through the book. Theres also a subplot regarding her husband\'s parentage which just felt...tiring by that point to be honest. Oh...we also get the dogs POV for alot of the story, which was a choice. To be fair, I was more invested and in the dog than Elizabeth and would have preferred the whole book in his voice. At least you could connect with him...the dog. 🤔The 2nd half of the book was a little better than the first and it had a more positive ending at least. I\'ve given it 1 stars because I did like the love story between Elizabeth and Calvin, as short lived as it was. It was very sweet, with two lonely nerds and outcasts meeting and forming such a strong bond.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Lessons in Chemistry by Bonnie GarmusIt\'s the early 60s and chemist Elizabeth Zott is causing her usual ruckus at Hastings Research Institute. For one thing, she can\'t be a real chemist for the simple fact that she\'s a woman. Also, she won\'t make copies, get coffee, or do any of the other woman\'s work at the institute, and she\'s so cold and prickly she doesn\'t want to be touched or groped and isn\'t willing to provide ""favors"". Those are the reasons the men don\'t like Elizabeth. The women don\'t like her because she\'s attractive, she turns the heads of the men, and she doesn\'t know her place as a woman in a man\'s world.Also working at Hastings is Calvin Evans, a brilliant Noble prize nominee who has his very own massive lab where he can do who knows what and win more accolades. No one likes him either. Neither Calvin or Elizabeth care if anyone likes them, they just want to be left alone to do their jobs. But one day Elizabeth needs beakers and she knows Calvin has beakers so she barges into his lab and takes some. It\'s not love at first sight but it\'s pretty close and soon Elizabeth and Calvin are a very happy couple to the disdain of everyone who wishes them misery and failure.Elizabeth and Calvin even get a dog and name him Six-thirty. Then fate intervenes and Elizabeth and Six-thirty are on their own until baby Mad is born. Elizabeth never wanted children and she certainly never wanted to be a single mother. Elizabeth never wanted to be famous for a cooking show that she gets wrangled into hosting, either, but when money is tight, something has to give and now Elizabeth is fighting with her cooking show bosses rather than her Hastings Research Institute bosses. Elizabeth is famous for all the wrong reasons (according to her bosses) while the women who are glued to her show five days a week are seeing all the opportunities they never knew they had, to be more than housewives and mothers.This is a very funny story, with Six-thirty and Mad winning my heart immediately. It took a lot longer for me to warm up to Elizabeth but I finally did towards the end of the story. Life isn\'t fair, in fact, it\'s so unfair as to be criminal, and Elizabeth isn\'t sure how long she can go slogging along, not doing what she wants to do, which is important research as a chemist. There are a lot of really good side characters, a lot of really horrible side characters, and always, there is Calvin, locked away in Elizabeth\'s heart and dreams. I did have some issues with the story but overall it is humorous, clever, and allows Elizabeth to shine in all her intelligent glory. Even an afternoon cooking show can\'t hold her down or make her bend to what she doesn\'t believe.Pub: April 5th 2022Thank you to Doubleday Books and NetGalley for this ARC.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I don’t think anything I can say will do this book justice. I love it from beginning to end and it will most certainly be in my top five reads of 2021.It’s November 1961 and chemist Elizabeth Zott, who works at the Hastings Institute, has fallen into a TV role hosting ‘Supper at Six’ and has become an unlikely star in the ascendant. Cooking is chemistry, chemistry is life. Elizabeth is far from your average ‘60’s woman. For a start she’s a single mother to Mad Zott, shock, horror, especially to Mad’s odious teacher. Have I mentioned the dog, Six-Thirty? A divine canine, a failed bomb detection dog of remarkable emotional intelligence. Ten years earlier, same Institute, Calvin Evans, introvert, grudge holder, a genius, an exceptionally good rower and desperate to find a girlfriend meets Elizabeth Zott, also a grudge holder especially against the patriarchy. Chemistry in every sense of the word.Ok, here goes. It’s inspiring, heartwarming, sad, joyous, intelligent, funny, witty, quirky, original,highly entertaining, life affirmingly brilliant and genius in my opinion! It captures the times, the patronising way women are treated ( can you see my lip curl and a developing snarl?) the assumptions, the blatant sexism and way worse which shocks you to the core even though you know it’s all true. She uses chemistry to reveal the dangers of a lob sided society which is completely one sided and to demonstrate the false limits on the potential of 50% of the population. It’s so cleverly done and I’m a science dunce but it made sense to me! The dialogue is excellent, at times it’s laugh out loud funny as it’s so well phrased or the mastery of a put down or understatement. Elizabeth is quite simply fabulous, I love her and want to be her but I’ll certainly need to mug up on the chemistry! Equally amazing is Mad and yes, let’s go back to the dog. As a massive dog lover to have Six-Thirty as a character in his own right is admirable and it works so well. I adore him and want to adopt him. The relationships are excellent too, some are a meeting of minds or to nurture, of love and admiration, of kinship and some are of professional jealousy or sabotage.Overall, you’ll have gathered that I think this debut is amazing and I urge you to read it. It has every ingredient of a book that fascinates, delights, charms and engages. If for nothing else read it for Six-Thirty ... and to find his out he gets his name cos I’m not saying!!With thanks to NetGalley and especially huge thanks to Random House UK, Transworld Doubleday for the much appreciated arc in return for an honest review.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'I have a really hard time rating books poorly because I’m a firm believer that there’s some valuable lesson to be found in every story even if it’s not your cup of tea. However, I found myself having a visceral reaction throughout this book. I don’t like writing lengthy reviews, but I’m pretty heated by it.I also want to preface that I am a real-life woman chemist, one who also studied food chemistry and does science communication (scicomm) work, so I probably wasn’t the target audience. I found that the book felt very much like it was meant for the popsci “science doesn’t care about your feelings” crowd with major doses of white feminism trying to look intersectional but failing.And before I dive deep into examples of why I disliked this book, I want to mention that the story has been optioned for a streaming series. In case any producers or the author see this review: PLEASE reach out to the American Chemical Society. ACS worked directly with the producers of Breaking Bad to help ensure there was accurate representation of chemistry. Doing this matters. Improper representation of science in media has dire consequences in society, such as unrealistic forensic expectations in jury trials. As much as I disliked this book, I recognize that the tv show could be the first time many women/girls see a female chemist outside of cop shows, so I really want it to do a good job.Okay, now I will resume my griping.1. The ScienceI was immediately drawn to the premise of the book because I’m a chemist and I *love* fiction authored by scientists, so I thought this would be great! But the author isn’t a scientist apparently, and it becomes very obvious with how the characters talk in chemical formulas? What? That’s not a thing we do. Chemical formulas are a shorthand for writing, but we use the names. And at one point, the main character (supposedly a brilliant chemist) apologizes for the mess due to a misbalanced centrifuge. Y’all. Misbalanced centrifuges in the 1960s are SO DANGEROUS. This is simply not a quirky endearing mess a scientist would make in the midst of their genius—it’s something that would have disastrous consequences and quite likely kill someone, depending on the size of the centrifuge. Imagine treating someone accidentally hitting the accelerator instead of the brakes when a kid runs out in the middle of the road as a quirky example of your driving abilities—it’s of that scale of seriousness. I am also really appalled by how canned foods were demonized. In a scene of the cooking show, the protagonist discusses mushrooms. She tosses aside canned cream of mushroom soup as “poison.” Y’all, this got me so heated. You cannot just call an accessible form of food poison without offering any explanation. Canned foods were an important preserving technology used at the time, and to this day canned foods provide nutritious foods in a way that is safe to the environment. What impact is this gonna make on readers? Food deserts exist, and you can’t just demonize canned foods like that without any explanation. Oh and there was a weird episode of the cooking show where the analogy to explain chemical bonds was…geopolitics? What? It made no sense.Overall, this book is just filled with unnecessary jargon that feels like it’s trying to sound smart without saying anything, which is frustrating as hell. Jargon makes science inaccessible to people, and it feels like a story about empowering housewives to pursue their STEM dreams should focus on demistifying science rather than feeling like a chick lit version of The Big Bang Theory.2. The MoodThis book is described as “hilariously funny”. I wish it were. I think it tries to be funny, but then it has some seriously heavy themes that it does not handle gently. There are two sexual assault scenes, and the main love interest dies pretty early on in an awful scene. It was a lot.3. The CharactersY’all, I hate the protagonist. She’s so two dimensional. The absolute smartest chemist in the institute, always talks in jargon even when it’s absolutely unnecessary, yet somehow is so charismatic to become a lead of a tv show with no television credits? What? And once she’s the star of the show, she makes really unreasonable demands about how it should be run and it’s presented like it’s #feminism rather than being unreasonable and awful. And the love interest is a complete asshole to everyone, yet manages to treat the protagonist with a modicum of respect, so of course she falls madly in love with him. I really don’t find any of the side characters to be interesting or compelling—in fact, they all felt like caricatures. I’m also baffled by including the dog’s POV? Also confused by how he went from running away from bombs to successfully finding the purse bomb and delivering it safely? Also why was the dog working in the lab? Literally do not understand any of these choices.4. The PoliticsThere is no way that a woman in the 60s would discuss secularism and socialism on air. This absolutely killed any suspension of disbelief I might have had. This made the book feel like some weird fantasy of the era.5. The Religious CommentaryI’m honestly galled by this even as an atheist. This book felt like a pretty direct attack on religious beliefs? So many of the characters made their hatred of religion to be such a big part of their personalities, and it was so off-putting. You can be a scientist and religious. It’s okay. It doesn’t make you a bad scientist, and I really hate that this books presents it that way. While I’m not religious, I have several friends and colleagues who are and they do excellent science. This really felt like a weird author vendetta that went against the mission of empowering women in STEM.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '2.5 stars rounded up to 3.

Unfortunately for her, she lives in a time where it is believed that women have no place in science, it's a world where men dominate, control, exploit, patronise and silence women, sexually harrassing, lying, cheating and stealing her research, publishing and passing it off as their own. It doesn't stop there, men feel they can sexually assault a woman, and it will be the woman who pays the price, Elizabeth is forced to leave, unable to complete her PhD, with the police expecting her to 'regret' her behaviour, such are the rage inducing social norms and attitudes of the time.However, Elizabeth is no ordinary woman, she refuses to pander to fragile male egos, it worries her not one whit that she doesn't fit in at the patriarchal Hastings Institute, she accepts no limitations for herself, nor for anyone else. The chemistry between her and the star scientist, Calvin Evans, another man who does not fit either, leads to love, the two of them living together, Zott does not believe in marriage, and their religion is science. Circumstances result in Zott becoming a single mother to the precociously bright 4 year old, Mad, an early reader, voraciously consuming the likes of Norman Mailer and Charles Dickens. The challenges Zott faces, such as being fired for being pregnant and her dire financial circumstances has her becoming an unlikely, reluctant and uncompromising star, dressed in a lab coat, with her popular TV cooking show, Supper at Six, focusing on the chemistry of ingredients and recipes, carrying her subversive and radical agenda of making women question and challenge the cultural misogyny and the limitations placed on their lives. Needless to say, this makes her some implacable enemies.What makes the strong and independent Zott able to face the unrelenting harsh pressures and problems that come her way are her close knit and growing family, at the centre of which is their protective genius dog no-one will be able to resist, Six-thirty, familiar with more than 600 words, neighbour Harriet Sloane, rower Dr Mason, her TV producer, Walter Pine, and the Reverend Wakely, perhaps we can include Miss Frask too. This is a remarkable, hilarious and unforgettable debut from Garmus, outrageously entertaining, with oodles of charm, and I have no doubt that this will be a runaway success on publication. Do yourself a favour and read this brilliant novel. Highly recommended!

The two fall in love, adopt “Six Thirty”, the smartest and most resourceful dog EVER, and dare to move in together-out of wedlock. GASP!But, this isn’t a “Happily Ever After” love story.Fast forward a couple of years, and Elizabeth is now a single mother, with a PRECOCIOUS 4 year old to support. When she discovers another child is taking advantage of her daughter Mad (the name was accidental) during lunch break at school, she demands a face to face meeting with the little girl’s father.She leaves with much more than an apology.SOMEHOW, she has agreed to host a “cooking show” on TV-though she insists that her show is about Chemistry!The now RELUCTANT star of “Supper at Six” refuses to wear sexy dresses, insisting instead on a lab coat and the #2 pencil ✏️ she ALWAYS wears in her hair, or tucked behind one ear. (See it on the adorable book cover!)And, she won’t even recite the dinner ingredients in layman’s terms. YET, after the very FIRST episode airs, the station’s phones are ringing off the hook-All, I can say is “VINEGAR” ! 🤐Within 2 years, her show is a staple in every household, with those in the studio audience and at home taking notes -jotting down ingredients, recipes and chemical equations!Elizabeth, despite her lack of smiles, and her “no nonsense” approach has somehow struck a chord with the “housewives” she thought she had nothing in common with. It seems that she is teaching them to do more than “cook a sensible, nourishing dinner”.I loved tuning in to these episodes! 📺With the help of her “wise beyond her years” child, her overachieving dog, and a community of wonderful supporting characters, Elizabeth Zott-may just “change the world” one “thirty minute lesson at a time”!Thank You to Doubleday for my gifted copy!

That is Bonnie Garmus’s masterpiece:Lessons In Chemistry.Find all my favorite #womeninSTEM novels here!A SHORT PREVIEW:When Elizabeth Zott is growing up… the only thing she knows for certain is that she likes science. During the 1960s, while she was working at the Hastings Institute on groundbreaking research in abiogenesis – gender equality was nonexistent (even among scientists who should know better.) Life takes her through unexpected turns into falling in love with her co-worker Calvin Evans. Years later, as a single mother, Elizabeth finds herself the star of a live cooking show: Supper at Six. With her… unique… approach to cooking and can-do-attitude… Elizabeth finds herself teaching women more than to cook. She’s teaching them to value themselves and change the world.THOUGHTS:This is one of those books that reminds us we can absolutely do anything we put our minds to, even in the face of challenging circumstances. So much of Elizabeth’s character revolves around building herself up and building up the women around her.. she somewhat reminds me of Jessica Chastain’s character in The Help? (Another incredible book/movie adaptation!) She doesn’t care that society’s expectations of her dictate a certain kind of life. The book’s take on what women really go through in the most thankless job in the world: motherhood and ‘keeping house’ are insights that we all truly need!P.S. ‘Lessons in Chemistry’ is coming to Apple TV in 2023!

I had to double-check the period this novel was set in. There were quite a few aspects that felt anachronistic. Anachronisms drive me crazy and their presence ruined many historical novels for me. I also think it's lazy and assumes that the readers are ignorant, not to mention, that it doesn't take that long to google.And then there was the preachiness, and the monologues, and the overexplaining.

So, I was immediately drawn to Lessons in Chemistry. Elizabeth Zott is a chemist in the early 1960s, back when women were a rarity in the field. Headstrong and independent, she refuses to tow the line expected. I came more than a decade later, but men’s attitudes hadn’t changed much in the 70s. So, I totally related to her, especially her relationship with Six Thirty.The book follows her as she becomes a single mother and then the star of a tv cooking show. There is a dry humor to the book. Actually, the humor gets more broad as the story goes on. I started off chuckling. Then snorting. Then laughing out loud to the point my husband insisted on knowing what I was reading.I sometimes have a problem when dogs are anthropomorphized. But it didn’t bother me here, even when his thoughts were included. I only wish my dog understood 900 words.The writing here is smart, descriptive, engaging. I found myself chortling over phrase after phrase - the sheer exactness of them. “Every day she found parenthood like taking a test for which she had not studied. The questions were daunting and there wasn’t nearly enough multiple choice.” Not only did I love the immediate family of Elizabeth, Madeline and Six Thirty, I adored Mrs. Sloane, Dr. Mason, Rev. Wakefield, Walter. While the book is humorous, there’s also a lot of emotion packed into it. I adored the ending. (I also loved that Garmus thanked her dogs in her Acknowledgments.) I even loved that I learned a thing or two about cooking.I can’t recommend this enough. I can’t wait to see what Ms. Garmus comes up with next.My thanks to Netgalley and Doubleday Books for an advance copy of this book.Update - I just read this a second time for my book club.

Yet Elizabeth isn\'t wired that way, and the journey of this book shows her humor, warmth, and intelligence in a way that baffles the status quo.This novel is uplifting, at times infuriating, and still every time heartwarming and encouraging.

Cringe worthy – yes sometimes that as well.Elizabeth Zott has a brilliant mind, so she believes but not a view shared by many men, except Calvin Evans. A man who has created his own rule book and because of his prized work is revered. Yet a man who shares Elizabeth’s passion for chemistry, igniting a romance and a discovery of soul mates that was not destined to last, when Calvin’s life was cut short prematurely.The sad turn of events leads Elizabeth to begin hosting a TV show where her cooking techniques use the unconventional notion and language of chemistry to educate her viewers.With a book titled ‘lessons’, it is only right to share a few of life’s lessons that Elizabeth is guided by1.\tIf you fail, don’t admit it. You have just found the million reasons why something wouldn’t work - I must try that!!!!2.\tDon’t work the system outsmart it - yes I agree to that3.\tFearless in the kitchen translates to fearless in life - I wish !!!4.\tThe best strategy is not to fear the danger but respect it - great lesson5.\tTake risks don’t be afraid to experiment - depends on the experiment 😁With the focus on experimentation, chemistry, and the female role. Lessons in Chemistry is a book that encourages us to think beyond cultural simplicity, acknowledge that some of our own achievements are limited by those restrictions we place on ourselves and fight to change the things in your life that matter. You know as the saying goes ‘anything worth having is worth fighting for’.If you don’t take the book too seriously and literally then you might love, it. If you try to analyse all the messages and connect it to your personal situation, then you might tear it apart.I for one enjoyed this story.

However, for entertainment it was certainly an excellent choice.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Anything less than a 5-star review for Bonnie Garmus’s debut novel is a minority opinion, so take my 4-star thoughts with a grain of salt. Or as the book’s heroine Elizabeth Zott would say, a grain of sodium chloride.Lessons in Chemistry tells the story of a brilliant scientific mind in the 1960s. Only problem is that the mind is in the body of the woman. Not just any woman, but an atypical one who has no interest in marriage or the other traditional trappings of domestic life. Still, one thing leads to another, and she finds herself with a daughter living in the suburbs. Because of the gender roles of that era, her passions and talents for chemistry are going to waste until she ends up with a nightly television show teaching other women how to cook. “Suppers at Six” finally gives home-bound, invisible moms a platform to ask questions, dream big, and prioritize themselves. It also puts items like “acetic acid” on their shopping lists. (That’s vinegar for all you non-sciency types like me.)I enjoyed my time with Elizabeth Zott and look forward to whatever Bonnie Garmus writes next. My slight hesitation in fully recommending Lessons in Chemistry is that it deals with some very serious themes. One major scene and plot point deals with sexual assault, and I just wish it hadn’t gone allllllll the way there. I think when picking up a book like this I’m looking to escape darker reads that include violence against women. Alas, rape, lather, rinse, repeat. Sigh.The novel’s manuscript was snatched up in a bidding war for adaptation rights by Apple TV+ pre-publication, so actress Brie Larson is already cast to play Elizabeth Zott. If the series is faithful to the novel, it’ll end up feeling like a #metoo-era feminist woman took a time machine back to the 1960s.

The all male research team she works with talks down to her rather than appreciating her as the driving force behind their projects. She\'s weary of males talking over her when she presents her findings and taking credit for her work.The one exception to this is Calvin Evans, a gifted research scientist at HRI, and a two time Nobel-prize nominee, who has fallen in love with Elizabeth and her brilliant mind. The attraction is real!Elizabeth views herself as a scientist but knows, by experience, female scientists are virtually non-existent. Ten days before graduating with her master\'s degree from UCLA, the admissions committee rescinded her application to the doctoral program.An \'unfortunate event\' happened and Elizabeth actions were determined to be the cause. She knows that getting her PhD is no longer possible but she\'ll never give up her dream. Her only regret is not having more No. 2 pencils to use when the \'unfortunate event\' took place!Ten years later, Elizabeth is a single mother living with her adorable daughter, Madeline, their dog, Six-thirty, and hosting the daily TV cooking show, Supper at Six. The show is an instant hit and Elizabeth is the beautiful, but reluctant, star!In front of a live audience, Elizabeth uses her platform to not only teach women about the chemistry of cooking, but about life being more important than cooking! It\'s about following your dream of having a family and a career just like men do!What a delightful story with a mid 20th Century timeline. If I could spend time with a character, it would absolutely be Elizabeth. I applaud her resilience, resourcefulness, and unwavering belief that women are as worthy as men. If I was in her shoes, I would wear a No. 2 pencil behind my ear or in my hair, too!A bit of a rebel, smart as a whip, she speaks her mind without holding back, and believes in what\'s right. She loves her daughter and Six-thirty, the dog, who knows 600+ words and has a significant role in this story. He\'s quite the canine character and loves Madeline and Elizabeth as much as they love him. It\'s pretty special!This is an amazing debut novel with quirky characters, socially relevant topics, emotional swings, winks of humor and laugh-out-loud moments!

But several friends assured me I’d enjoy it, and it’s currently 53% at 5* and less than 1% at 1* on GR.The first page was good! It conjured women’s limited choices of 1961 in a wry way that I liked:“Before anyone knew there’d even be a sixties movement… when the big wars were over and the secret wars had just begun and people were starting to think fresh and believe everything was possible.”The plot had promise, too. Elizabeth Zott is a chemist in academia, but is forced out before her doctorate because of the misogyny of the times. When she finds success as a reluctant star of daytime TV, she subverts the genre by making her cooking show about chemistry, not domesticity.ContentThe first half (pre-TV) was OK-ish. The second half was ever more ludicrous, and not really funny or feminist, as it descended to sentimental and largely predictable mush.The whole book is packed with clichés, caricatures, and coincidences, but they’re most egregious in the final chapters.Patriarchy, pencils in the hair (see cover art of some editions), sexual assault, rowing (boats, not arguments), a kindergarten family-tree project, and the corrupting power of money all feature prominently.Image:A mixed pair of rowers: students Jodie Cameron and Ryan Glymond at the 2021 British Championships(Source)On screenIronically, I think this might work better as a sit-com than a book.

I know dogs are clever and empathetic, but paragraphs of his profound and knowledgeable philosophising on oftenabstractconcepts were just silly. He even had opinions on Proust!There's lots of self-conscious quirk, some of which fits the period more plausibly than others, and much of it is based on stereotypes played for laughs, rather than realism. Like Elizabeth, my 20-something is a scientist at heart, with a passion for cooking. They've extended their skills beyond anything I've taught them by structured research and experimentation around the chemical reactions involved. But even they wouldn't call salt “sodium chloride” (except perhaps as a one-off joke), let alone vinegar by... whatever the chemical name was Elizabeth used on her TV show.Chemical bondsAttraction, bonding, change - all aspects of chemistry, loudly signposted in this book.Elizabeth is an odd mix of socially inept and effortlessly sexy. She and Calvin Evans both have tragic backstories that leave them conveniently free of family ties, but with an air of mystery that may or may not be revealed: the means are largely unscientific.

DUH!• misery is quite possibly the most oblivious, useless, boring, weakest, most lame vampire i have ever read about. her being a vampire is actually really irrelevant that you might even forget she’s a vampire. she doesn’t know the difference between a ladle and spatula. ali really likes making her heroines really fucking stupid.• don’t ask me what she looks like because i wouldn’t know. all i know is that she bleeds purple and has pointy ears, which is a weird feature for vampires but whatever. it seems like this author still doesn’t like describing to her readers her characters enough to make them visualizing.• absolutely bland, boring, and very unflavored mmc, just like the rest. he’s a werewolf, has hair that is short and a rich brown cut to a buzz, is the alpha, has broad shoulders…that’s it. anything new? no, obviously. he growls and hisses, but this time he is an artist, i guess, who draws the mc, and takes care of a child.• this was only my third read from this author. i’ve readThe Love HypothesisandLove on the Brain, but i’ve avoided everything published after ‘love on the brain’ because i know i wouldn’t enjoy them. fortunately, i don’t have any desire to read them. i read this because it’s the first paranormal romance by this author, and, for some reason, i thought the genre would mean this would be different. that was not the case for me, obviously. i don’t think i’ll be reading this author again in the futureunless serena and koen get their story cause that ending?? 👀• terrible job of world-building. this author needs to stick to contemporaries. not only does this author not give enough physical descriptions about her characters features but the world building is severely lacking. there is little to no explanation of where and how everything happened. we really just get the basic information necessary. a lot of info dump in the beginning—historical context, names, wars, systems, political diplomatic views, etc. everything piled together.• formulaic, boring, cliché, and immature writing. i can’t even say it’s because this author started off writing fanfiction on ao3 when so many fanfics on ao3 (and even wattpad) are written immensely better than this. so many books published yet this this authors writing hasn’t improved since her debut. i guess when you write a book like the love hypothesis, your quality of books isn’t important anymore because you know your targeted audience will eat up the bare minimum. the characters in this might as well be the same as her previous characters except they’re in a paranormal setting.•if you are excited for this, take my review with a grain of salt as i haven’t enjoyed this author before so just because i didn’t like it, doesn’t mean you won’t.a lot of my friends love this author and her stories. if you haven’t read ali before, you might like it! or, if read her before and have an idea what to expect and don’t care about the formulaic writing, you might enjoy this! for me, the unoriginality, lack of world building, lack of physical characteristics, writing, dialogue, etc., are what made this another disappointing read. if you enjoy this though, good for you!""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '3.75/5I didn\'t expect this book to receive such a high rating from me, but as it turns out, I liked it — I liked it a lot even. I read Ali Hazelwood for the vibes and obsessed heroes, and that\'s exactly what I got, so I\'m satisfied. Satisfied to the point that this book may have become my favorite Ali book. I never thought a book with an arranged marriage between an alpha werewolf and a vampire would become one, but here we are. I guess that\'s what happens when you grow up with Wattpad.Listen. Is Ali the best author with the most gorgeous writing style? No. Does she write almost the same male characters, but with different hairstyles and workplaces? Yes. But does it matter to me? No. Her stories always absorb me from the very beginning to the end to the point where I completely forget about reality, so I simply love them despite their many imperfections. You could look me straight in the eye and tell me that these books are cringe, stupid, predictable and that I can probably find better stories on Wattpad, and I would completely agree, but I would still simply read them, as they just have that something that works for me.But, let’s move on to the point. My thoughts. Some spoilers also start here.oneIf you were expecting another short heroine and a hero who would be twice her size, you will be disappointed. We finally have a tall couple.\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200etwoI really liked our heroine Misery. Yes, Ali did her dirty with that name and some of her fashion choices — the galaxy t-shirt, but it doesn\'t change the fact that I enjoyed her character. She definitely won\'t be added to my \'favorite heroines\' folder, but compared to really dumb heroines, she wasn\'t bad.threeThe hero, despite the situation at the end when I wanted to strangle him, yes, I\'m talking about the scene in chapter twenty-five when he left her, claiming that ""it was a mistake"" and ""she shouldn\'t be tied to someone like him"", still stole my heart. I know he wanted her to finally have free will and be able to choose what she wanted in her life, but he could have approached it differently.Still, as I said, I loved him. How could I not love the possessive architect Alpha Werewolf who has an amazing way with children, who would do anything for you and his people, who would draw you, who would remind you that consent is the hottest thing in the world and with whose side you would finally find your family and your place in the world. Yes, I know the part about ""architect Alpha Werewolf"" sounds stupid and like something straight out of a bad Wattpad fanfiction, but I don\'t care.“I would take anything she chose to give me—the tiniest fraction or her entire world. I would take her for a single night knowing that I’ll lose her by morning, and I would hold on to her and never let go. I would take her healthy, or sick, or tired, or angry, or strong, and it would be my fucking privilege. I would take her problems, her gifts, her moods, her passions, her jokes, her body—I would take every last thing, if she chose to give it to me.”fourThe romance was in typical Ali Hazelwood style, meaning a hero who is almost in love with the heroine from the beginning, but for some reason doesn\'t want to admit it, and a heroine who can\'t pick up any hint about it even though it\'s quite obvious. However, this does not change the fact that I ate it up. The smut too, if you know me, you don\'t, but it was kind of hot.fiveThe plot was pretty interesting to me in the beginning, but it lost me towards the end when I stopped caring about the whole werewolf/vampire rivalry and Misery’s friend situation, but I was still intrigued enough to not put the book down once, so I won\'t complain.This was supposed to be a short review, but it didn\'t work out again, but if you are looking for a marriage in convenience romance, found family, werewolves and vamps, a slow-burn with, at least, in my opinion, great tension, don’t be shy and add it to your tbr.————————Vampires and werewolfs?

I applaud Ali Hazelwood for taking a risk out of her comfort zone and writing this paranormal romance. She did not ruin werewolves and vampires for me after all 😌This change of writing and direction was majorly needed and it worked brilliantly. But tbf I had minimal expectations 🤷\u200d♀️✔️ Vampires + werewolves✔️ Marriage of convenience✔️ Slow burnThis one came pretty close to perfection. I liked the plot, characters and romance.The paranormal romance and gothic vibes were really good, the whole environment was quite mesmerizing.Tho I would suggest that please don't go in expecting a world building- it's just romance. It's also quite fast paced and easy to binge. If you are in a reading slump, this is your cure.The characters are fun.Misery and Loweare truly made for each other. I love how they balance each other out. While Misery is unlike misery, in fact quite joyful and a fun vamp to be around. Lowe, on the other hand keeps to himself. I also noticed that Lowe although a werewolf, had a very Edward Cullen like personality. Instead of a typical douche, you are met with someone who actually cares. Misery's sarcasm and sense of humor was fun. Ali Hazelwood thankfully for once did not go over the top with it.The side characters-Ana, Serena and Alex were stand outs. Owen was kinda predictable. It also seems like there's something happening with Serena and Koen? Is there going to be another book? CAUSE I NEED IT!!!The romancewas pretty good. I devoured how Lowe and Misery were into each other. The slow burn was delicious. The spice not so much. Ali, listen to me bestie, in the most gentle way possible, babes, you cannot write smut 😭😭 I know you want to. But please for the love of God, stop writing smut. I wanna give you five stars but I can't until you stop knotting, and opening an Airbnb inside people's vaginas 😭😭On a serious note,one thing that could have been better written was the mate storyline.It did not make sense. One moment Lowe wants her, the next he doesn't, then he does, then he doesn't, and then he does. Yeah, he clearly wanted her so why write it like that?! That deducted a star from me.Overall, it's pretty fun and worth trying.

I'm an Ali Hazelwood stan, so my hopes for her very first PNR were extremely high, and I’m so happy that it lived up to all my expectations. This is a marriage of convenience between a vampire heroine and an alpha werewolf hero. Misery is the daughter of a powerful vampire politician and she enters a MOC with Lowe, the alpha of a werewolf pack, not just to form an alliance between the two species (who don’t like each other), but also to find out where her missing best friend is.It’s such a fun read and I loved learning about this paranormal world. The romance is classic Ali Hazelwood, just with a PNR twist. Basically, we have a hero who’s secretly pining and growing obsessed with the heroine, and she has no idea. It’s a little slow burn, but there’s still some GOOD steam. It’s focused just more in the second half of the book. But I loved Lowe and Misery, and I LOVED Misery's sense of humor.

Ali Hazelwood showed readers how to rock \'n\' roll in a fantasy universe by creating the most intelligent, quirky, nerdy heroine free of stereotypes and clichés. She possesses magical fingers that can sharpen computer skills for coding and breaking into highly secured werewolf territories!Themes of enemies to lovers and forbidden love may initially make us think we\'re in for a Twilight-like romance story. However, I assure you that this complex story offers so much more. Firstly, this book is more than a forbidden romance; it tells the tale of Misery Lark, the only daughter of the most powerful Vampyr councilman in the South, and Lowe Moreland, the most powerful Alpha of the Werewolves. Their marriage aims to bring peace and create an alliance between age-old mortal enemies. There\'s so much happening in the story, including political maneuvering and highly calculated schemes within the territories of werewolves and vampyres. A group of rebels, calling themselves the ""Loyals,"" whose lives have been spared by Lowe, seeks to avenge him by recruiting insiders from their inner circles, blackmailing them into committing treasonous acts.The story is filled with action-packed sequences, intricate world-building, and intercepted mysteries about Lowe\'s family line and Misery\'s inner circle, all of which intrigue readers to learn more. Interestingly, the adventure parts of the book slightly overshadow the romantic aspects. The fantasy world-building and the detailed rules and historical progress among werewolves, vampyres, and humans are depicted intelligently. I expected Ali Hazelwood to excel in the fantasy genre as much as in steamy romance, and I\'m thrilled to say she didn\'t disappoint.Here\'s a summary of the events in this book:After evading several attempts on her life, including bullets, knives, and other lethal weapons orchestrated to kill her, Misery leaves the Vampyre community to live in the human world with her best friend, Serena. She gets a job, wears contact lenses to conceal her irises, hides her fangs, and strives to create a peaceful life. However, her father summons her, proposing a marriage between werewolves and vampyres to establish an alliance during the reign of a new human governor. Misery is too smart not to take the bait, but as soon as she hears the name of the groom-to-be, she accepts the offer without asking for details. Is it a martyr complex, a personal concession, or does she have another agenda for her extremely masculine groom who cannot stand her scent?After the marriage ceremony proceeds without incident, if you discount the usual suicide attempts against Misery (she\'s become accustomed to these life-threatening situations since she was once a forced prisoner for a peace offering, but that\'s another story), Misery finds herself in her secluded mansion, surrounded by werewolves who despise her, searching for a reason to end the forced arrangement. Only six-year-old Anna, Lowe\'s little sister, acts friendly toward her despite her caregivers\' snarky comments about Misery.When Lowe senses the secret that threatens her unwanted marriage, he offers her an alliance to uncover the mysteries that will ultimately benefit them. However, not only their lives but also their hearts are at stake during this very perilous, full-throttle, wild adventure.Lowe is more than a vindictive alpha werewolf facade. He\'s loyal, perceptive, caring, and puts everyone\'s needs first. He\'s the first person to show how much he truly cares about her. Could she learn to trust and lower her emotional barricades to let him in?Overall, this is a smart, riveting, and highly entertaining quirky fantasy romance that I thoroughly enjoyed. I hope there will be more to come, as implied in the epilogue. I wholeheartedly congratulate my favorite steamy romance author for immersing me in a well-executed fantasy world, even though I\'m not a big fan of werewolves (I was never on Team Jacob).Many thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing this amazing book\'s digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest thoughts.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""what started off as promising went downhillquick.╰┈➤ first 1/3 of the book: solid 4 stars 😄╰┈➤ if i had skipped the spice: 3 stars 🙂╰┈➤the book including theknotspice: 2 stars 🥴╰┈➤ the spice alone: 0 stars. negative stars, even. jail.the spice wasknotit.it wasn't even the knot itself that was bad... it washowthe scenes were written. i amslightly?traumatized. i also traumatized my husband when i forced him to read some of the spice. at least i’m not alone in my misery.speaking of Misery...… really? that is, no joke, the name of the fmc. need i say more?i hope i never have to think ofThe Home Depot’sLowe’s strange, lumpy penis ever again.i am moving on now, goodbye. 👋🏻😌""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""This isknotnot your typical Ali Hazelwood butif you are looking for a furr-ociously good time…no, no, that's too corny…mount up and…wait, too suggestive…sink your teeth into…ah hell…Okay soBrideby Ali Hazelwood is going to lend itself to a lot of jokes and I applaud Hazelwood for leaning into them because at its heart this is a fun and rather bitingly funny novel that brings us back into the veins of paranormal romance that dominated the early 2000s. A forced wedding between a vampire and werewolf (a big, beefy, beast of a man-beast) in order to uphold an uneasy truce kick off this story of paranormal politicking and high-energy action paired with a slow-burn romance of an enemies-to-lovers plot (okay it’s not really EtL, it’s more like vaguely-distrustful to lovers) that puts a new meaning to the term “heavy petting” (pawing?). I tend to prefer romance stories that have a larger plot to hold them up, which is what we have here, though admittedly the plot is a bit lackluster and kind of conflates complicating the reveal of the politics and mysteries with actual complexity. Still this is a pretty fun read that highlights a lot of what Hazelwood does best in a very different scenario for her while also making it feel like a natural next step for her stories and I think this is one that if decide to bite in for some fun, you’ll get just that.Oh, have I mentioned the werewolf is huge yet? Big shocker in a Hazelwood book, right? I mean, when I saw werewolf man we all knew this was coming (and so is he…) but guess what? Misery (oh yea, she named her Misery lol) is tall, so I’d like to applaud Hazelwood for some character growth. Oh, wait, sorry, Werewolf Lowe is actually so huge he can’t even fit in their single king-sized bed (if you are playing Romance Tropes drinking game, take a shot for single bed) so you be the judge if its still her big man little woman trope (if yes, take another shot). But it is sort of fun to see a lot of Hazelwood’s signature elements here and I suppose this is the paranormal offshoot of her STEM stories as Misery happens to be a computer genius and that comes in handy (paw-y?) here.There’s a lot going on here and without spoiling much, due to some long feud and a lot of weird truces that tend to involve hostages and interspecieseroticapairings, humans, werewolves and vampires are all poised and ready for bloodshed and this marriage is another stop-gap in that all. Misery now has to live amongst werewolves (they go by Weres which…okay I’ll get to the world building soon but its not the best) who definitely want to kill her but shes so used to ‘feeling alone among people who were never supposed to be my own’ after living with humans all life that she’s gonna give it the old college try! Good for her even if ‘the whole rival-species-bound-by-centuries-of-hostility-until-the-bloody-demise-of-the-weakest-will-put-an-end-to-the-senseless-suffering thing might seem discouraging.’ Theres a slow moving romance as they move from utter distrust to relying on each other and Lowe being pretty damn into her while refusing to admit it and Misery refusing to notice that he’s pretty damn obvious because we need to stretch this already thin plot out with some romantic tension (drink). This is actually fairly light on the romance and the spicier stuff comes later and while this book does lean towards some omegaverse vibes it feels more a nod to all that than actually embracing it. Except knotting (take a shot). Hazelwood fans will enjoy this and they should, though I’m curious if those who might come to this from a deep love or paranormal romance might find it to read like a pop song cover of a deep-cut song they enjoy.This felt fairly undercooked though to me. In part because the world building is mostly done through conversation between Misery and Lowe, which is something I love in theory and found books likeThe Long Way to a Small, Angry Planetto brilliantly execute world building through picking up context in casual conversations between characters, but here the two are distrustful and all coy about revealing things. Its like pulling teeth because thats basically what they are doing to get answers out of each other and I found myself shaking the book screamingjust fucking tell me already(take another shot, not for tropes but in solidarity). Actually, Lowe is kind of annoying at times to be honest, even with his whole “tough alpha” schtick masking that he’s really a sweet sensitive boy packing a donkey sized dick (drink), and his whole “want better than me” thing was eye rolling. But anyways, the bigger catch is…none of the elements feel particularly fresh? And nobody wants a stale body if you are going to suck it’s blood, am i right vampires? A lot of it felt rather cut-and-paste or “spot what this is inspired by” which sometimes made me realize I liked the techniques better in the other books. Theres definitely a BIGUnderworldfilm vibe here, and the whole sucking blood being orgasmic has been done before. I didn’t dislike this book but it made me actually realize I might like Butler’sFledglingmore than I did before. It all works though, I just don’t think fantasy world building is Hazelwood’s greatest strength and a lot of the ambiguities work to ignore that a lot of it feels fairly flimsy.So will these two ‘live bitingly ever after’ or will the politics of their world crush them? It’s worth a read, and I did like the characters quite a bit. I do like Misery asserting herself against and “alpha” and him recognizing her as a strong woman with agency. The plot is pretty fun too with some good twists, and really I have nothing to complain about other than it just didn’t land as well for me as her YA book.

I would take her for a single night knowing that I’ll lose her by morning, and I would hold on to her and never let go. I would take her healthy, or sick, or tired, or angry, or strong, and it would be my fucking privilege. I would take her problems, her gifts, her moods, her passions, her jokes, her body—I would take every last thing, if she chose to give it to me.”and they had me truly rooting for them, unable to put this book down, after the very first scene of them together. but this also has a pretty big mystery plotline that took me by surprise, and also completely enthralled me. and ultimately this had such a big emphasis on found family and finding your own pack of people you love and trust unconditionally that i feel like i just ended up loving the entire cast of side characters too.let’s just embrace the bullet points and quickly talk about other things i really loved:➛ obviously vampires and werewolves➛ arranged marriagebutforbidden romance➛ one bed scene(s)➛ the cutest little sibling ever➛ the sweetest brother and sister relationship x2➛ and also a really heartwarming found family / best friend relationship⤷ It was truly givingbryce and danikabut better➛ a big appreciation of peanut butter➛ an amazing epilogue that will hopefully set up a book two in this worldi will say that there was a very unnecessary and annoying third act conflict that just didn’t make sense to me (and made me side eye lowe a little), but i still really enjoyed this one and it was such a fast paced read that really tugged at my heartstrings in all the found family ways. i think i just really like ali hazlewood’s stories, and i always end up connecting with them on some level, and that just enhances my reading experience each and every time. i recommend this to all my romance friends, but i extra recommend it to all my pnr friends who want a little extra nostalgia on top of a really good story.lastly, and least importantly, if i ever dated anyone named misery, i feel like i would have to send hayley williams or paramore royalties. because the waymisery businesswas living in my head rent free while reading this was actually insane.content warnings from the author(please use caution for potential spoilers):death of several people within the context of a war between different species (vampires, werewolves, and humans) is mentioned, several mentions of blood, kidnapping, mild violence, poisoning and attempted murder, attempted kidnapping/harming of a child (she is unharmed), death of a parent (off page in the past and off page in the present), explicit and graphic sexual content, knotting (the mmc’s apparatus is not quite human?), cursing and vulgar languageother trigger + content warnings i found while reading(ali's books really do have such good tws - i am always so thankful and impressed): missing friend, mention of sickness of child (she is fine), spider mentions, brief mention of death during childbirth, brief mention of loss of a partner in past, mention of vomit, parental abuse and neglect, and violencemy amazing friend nadia gifted me this signed copy! i am so thankful and you'll never know how much i love ali's bat 🦇blog|instagram|youtube|wishlist|spotify|amazon♡The Love Hypothesis★★★★★♡Love, Theoretically★★★★♡Not in Love★★♡Two Can Play★★★★""}]"

I feel like Freida writes really well she know show to grip the readers, draw them in and keep them over there. It's like you can't stop, you will sacrifice your sleep, your studies, your hobbies, everything just to know more and the 'One more chapter' feeling with her books is so real because it's always one more chapter until you are eventually done with the books and that is one of the things about the boyfriend that I liked. It had an attractive writing style but I think Freida always fumbles when it comes to her characters, Millie and Nina were borderline annoying but Sydney Shaw made them look so much better. this book followed two pov's one in past about Tom and one set in the present following Sydney.Sydney was the most obnoxious fmc ever written to this date, I have never met such a dumb character!! like Idk how she survived even a single page. Her throughout the whole book is basically just figuring out why she cant find a man and why she shouldn't be jealous of her friends love life and then it slowly transitions into meeting a hot guy being suspicious of him, morphing into being conflicted between two guys, which then finally turned into Sydney thinking that she ate but made the most dumbest decisions leading to the last few chapters. She's so self absorbed and she does not change one bit throughout the books,. She was literally like a cardboard piece and I feel like character development was found dead when it came to her.I feel like her character was not well fit for this story, she was so inconsistent!! She would want to find her bestie's murderer but also forgets about it the moment a hot guy does something that a human being does and it made me so furious but also I feel like it was simultaneously a good thing because Sydney was so dumb that if she took everything in her own hands I would have thrown my phone on the wall and would have bald spots because I could not bear one more chapter of her trying to figure out who the killer was. I wasn't this interested in her story.The past point of view is where I had most of my concentration, it follows the pov of Tom who's trying to get this girl Daisy to fall in love with her and I was pretty hooked when it came to that because it had raised stakes and had me questioning things which was totally absent in the present pov, It had a more mysterious nature which I was expecting throughout the whole book. I feel like this pov definitely made me doubt a lot of things and I feel like it serves its purpose well!! This part was the saving grace of the book. (which helped me not dnf it)While the past pov was more interesting the character wasnt really :/ why were they trying so hard to shady and psychotic, honestly it was so eye roll worthy, She tried to make them so weird and Tom half of the time was deciding whether slug was his friend or not lmao. I wasn't that frustrated with his character as much as I was with Sydney but it wasn't exactly the best either.The plot overall was fine and the plot twist was the only things that I did not predict I was shooketh when it came to that because the way the story was building up I had no idea that was happening it did a whole 180 on my theories. I would say the past pov was more stronger because it had me raising questions like How does it connect to the main story and wanting to kknow what happened next and Sydneys plot line made me want to throw this book in a dumpster. It was okay with a good plot twist. I would say the after the twist, I think three or four chapters were left and they were very underwhelming and diluted. It felt like an episode of You mixed with real housewives of beverly hills and very diluted and all the high that twist put us through quickly faded away.The prologue and the epilogue are things that she aces while the prologue was really good and wild the Epilogue was the most eye roll worthy epilogue of the century, I could have lived easily without having read that. Waste of pages, waste of trees.Overall, I love her books and i've enjoyed all of them, even this but her characters seem to be growing more erratic one book after the other but I know this wont stop me from reading more of her books, I'll be lined up whenever shes releasing her next book!___Well time to say goodbye to my sleep schedule. (So happy I got an audiobook because exams are killing me)___I take a napmeanwhile Frieda Mcfadden:Here you go another book that would probably not let you sleep...""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'In the words of Forest Gump… STUPID IS AS STUPID DOES*pulls sleeves back, cracks knuckles*Ok lets go…Ms McFadden has come out with herfourth releaseof this year withThe Boyfriend. In this book we are following dimwit Sydney who just wants to find Mr Right and settle down. She goes on a date with a guy she’s been speaking to on a dating website and realises she has been catfished when he turns out to be a creepy little sod. When said sod starts behaving aggressively towards Sydney she is rescued by a charming mystery man and thinks she has finally found her match. Is Sydney about to get her happily ever after!???.... 😒😒🙄🙄🙄Our main character Sydney is one of the most idiotic characters I have had to suffer reading through. The boys in Dumb and Dumber don’t even come close to just how stupid Sydney is. So because we are going through this story in her narrative, we have to ignore the obvious and go round and round in mundane circles. In Sydney’s eyes every Red Flag was frankly Beige!Sydney and co are all caricature characters. There is not a single character development, and we don’t get to know anything else about them than what we barely already know.I had to stomach through the first 50% of the book with Freida talking about the most pointless things such as:Flabby arms/ Sleeveless dresses, Sydney being a bleeder, women over 34 and their fertility and of course Turtles... etc…The book is told in dual POVs with Sydney and a guy named Tom. Tom’s storyline is told in the past when he was 16 years old. He has a crush on a girl named Daisy Driscoll, who he really wants to be with, but he also wants to squeeze the life out of her, because you know he has a fetish for harming people and seeing blood. Oh and he really hates his dad.I WONDER HOW THESE TWO POVS ARE CONNECTED…😒😒😒Anyway, the story only really picks up after the 50% mark, but don’t get too excited because we still have deal with Sydney’s annoying ass and moronic inner thoughts. In true Freida fashion her mind games are activated, and I must admit that I did not see the “big” plot twist coming, but all the other ones were painfully obvious. Speaking of the major plot twist it is very, very,VERYdumb and of course with any Freida book suspension of disbelief isHIGHLY REQUIRED!The ending was so dense and dull, I had to fling my kindle, put myself in a corner and have a serious word with myself as to why I keep letting Freida do this to me.Then the epilogue…no words.Unfortunately,The Boyfriendis not a winner for me, but I will say it was more palatable than theHousemaid is Watching. My main issue is that nothing and no one’s actions made sense. Consequences and common sense was not a factor in this book. Extreme things would happen and then just be swept under the rug. Besides the‘big twist’, the book was very mild and produced more eye rolls than I can possibly count. For a quick mindless read/ listen and to laugh at the brainlessness of a bunch of characters then you can give this book a go.Freida I will keep hoping and praying that we will get back to how we once were.I will see you in 2025 forThe Crash😭😭😭THE END.2.5 ⭐------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------⋆｡°✩pre read⋆｡°✩ITSSSSS TIIIIIIIIMEEEEEEE!🤩🤩The devil works hardBut Freida McFadden works harder!Fingers Crossed this one delivers!🤞🏾🤍❤️🤍'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Freida did it again!

This book was a fun mystery but my least fav Frieda McFadden book I've read so far. I liked that it had two timelines & the concept was really fun. Also the twist got me!!! I did not see it coming. Would've never guessed the ending in a million years. BUT for a good chunk of the book I felt like I was waiting for more things to happen. I wanted more clues, suspicious people, and creepy moments. Overall great if you're looking for a light easy read.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""listen.... did I guess the twist? yes. was the main character dumb as a box of rocks? also yes.but I ate this one up I'm not even gonna lie""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '➳3/5 stars""I wonder what it’s like to cut into a person with a scalpel. To feel their skin separate under my hand. To see their insides.""I had such high expectations for this book, especially since I\'ve always loved Frieda\'s work, but unfortunately, it turned out to be a disappointment. I won’t lie, I was super excited to dive into it, but it just didn’t hit the right spot for me. It had potential, but it fell short in areas where I expected it to shine. While I kept hoping for a twist or moment that would blow me away, it never came. It’s frustrating when a book by an author you admire doesn\'t meet your expectations.Freida has an incredible ability to pull readers in and keep them hooked from start to finish. Her writing style makes it almost impossible to put the book down. You find yourself sacrificing sleep, putting off your work, and delaying everything else in your life just to keep reading. That“just one more chapter”feeling is so real with her books because every chapter leaves you wanting more, and before you know it, you\'ve finished the whole thing. That’s one of the things I genuinely appreciated about The Boyfriend, the way it kept me on edge and completely immersed in the story.This book is structured through two different points of view: one that takes place in the past, focusing on Tom’s story, and the other set in the present, following Sydney’s perspective. I found the present POV to be the least engaging, mainly because I was frustrated with the FMC and felt that nothing unexpected happened. It struck me as bland and mediocre. In contrast, the past POV captivated me. Each character was eccentric, and it was clear that something was off with each of them, making it far more interesting and compelling. The past POV carried a sense of mystery that I had hoped for throughout the book. It effectively made me doubt many things and ultimately served its purpose well. This section truly became the saving grace of the entire story.➳ABOUT THE CHARACTERS :-╰┈➤SYDNEY SHAW—Sydneyhas to be one of the most frustrating female main characters I’ve ever come across. I know I say this about every other FMCs, but honestly, Sydney took it to another level. Not only was she annoyingly self-absorbed, but she also seemed completely brainless at times. To make matters worse, she was desperate to find a boyfriend, which resulted in her constantly picking the wrong men. It was exhausting watching her make one bad decision after another.Throughout the entire book, Sydney’s primary concern is why she can\'t find a man and why she shouldn\'t feel jealous of her friends\' love lives. At first, she’s suspicious of a guy she meets, then she’s torn between two men, but her decisions become increasingly dumb as the story progresses. It’s frustrating because she remains so self-absorbed, making the same mistakes over and over again, without ever learning or growing as a character. I had hoped for some kind of shift in her thinking, especially after her best friend\'s murder, but instead, she quickly moves on, prioritizing her dating life over the loss of her friend. It was honestly ridiculous how fast she forgot.What really pushed me over the edge was how quickly she seemed to forget about her best friend\'s murder. Sure, she shed a few tears and got upset when the police couldn’t solve the case, but after a short time, she was back to focusing on her own dating life. After she found herself ""the perfect man,"" she didn’t even seem to care about her dead best friend anymore! I mean, who behaves like that? It was infuriating.╰┈➤TOM BREWER —This character was one of the most obvious figures from the start, and I won’t lie, he annoyed me at times. Yet, despite his flaws, he became the saving grace for both POVs. While he made questionable decisions, he wasn\'t as clueless as Sydney, which made him somewhat relatable.In the past POV, Tom is portrayed as a determined young man genuinely trying to win Daisy\'s affection. Their romantic journey kept me engaged and curious about how it would tie into the present narrative. Just when I thought I had it all figured out, a plot twist revealed the deeper connections. Even though there were moments of boredom, thinking he was the predictable criminal, I reminded myself of Frieda\'s style, as she has a knack for keeping readers guessing, and I appreciated the subtle hints that made me rethink my assumptions.From the very start, I sensed that something was fundamentally wrong with Tom, Daisy, and his best friend, Slug. Daisy seemed almost too good to be true; her character was crafted in such a way that it raised my suspicions. There was an underlying perfection about her that felt off, as if she were merely a facade.Tom, on the other hand, was an absolute psycho from the beginning. I mean, who genuinely thinks about killing their partner while claiming to love them more than anything?And then there’s Slug, what a character! He was utterly disgusting, both in his actions and demeanor.And for the plot twist i had my own suspicions about it and thought I had it all figured out, but the classic Frieda twist hit me unexpectedly, like a train wreck. However, it wasn\'t entirely unpredictable; I had sensed something was off about the character, so while it surprised me, I wasn\'t completely shocked.What really left me feeling let down was the absence of that final twist Frieda often delivers. You know, the kind that flips everything on its head and makes you reevaluate the entire story? I was hoping the epilogue would provide that last-minute surprise, especially after the earlier twist. Unfortunately, it didn’t come, and this lack of a conclusive twist made my disappointment even greater.➳""Overall, if you\'re in the mood for a book that will have you questioning just how dumb a person can be, then this might be the perfect read for you""💌— AND TO MY GORGEOUS GIRL RIRI <3I genuinely couldn\'t have made it through this book without your company and your patience with my rants.

Unfortunately, this one let me down. I was back and forth between giving this a 2 or 3 star rating, but ended up rounding it up to a 3. A good majority of the story felt unnecessary, the fmc was oblivious to the major red flags that were literally in front of her face, and the ending was so incredibly disappointing. I kinda wanted to toss my kindle across the room because all the signs were RIGHT there! It felt like a major reach for an interesting story because there is just no way one does not notice these signs. It was so impractical. This one wasn’t for me, but I will forgive Miss Freida and continue reading through the rest of her books, and still looking forward to her future ones!'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""✭2.5 starsThis book follows Sydney Shaw, a woman in New York struggling with her luck in dating until she meets a seemingly perfect boyfriend, a charming doctor. However, a series of brutal murders linked to a mystery man who targets women he dates casts a shadow over her newfound happiness. As Sydney begins to suspect that her ideal partner may be hiding dark secrets, she must navigate her growing fears and uncover the truth before she becomes the killer’s next victim.➸ I really enjoy Freida McFadden’s books—I’ve read a few, and while some are hits and others misses, this one was definitely a miss for me. I didn’t outright hate it, but it was frustrating. Freida has a real knack for writing stories that keep you flipping pages because you have to know what happens next. The pacing was solid, and the plot had enough twists to keep me interested, but then we get to the characters. They were so frustratingly clueless. It felt like they all took a class on making the dumbest decisions possible. I mean, it’s a thriller—I feel like characters should somewhat be smart enough to piece things together, yet they kept stumbling into one ridiculous situation after another. It was like watching a train wreck—you can't look away, but you’re also just so annoyed by their stupidity.This book had so much potential, and it’s such a letdown that the characters ruined it. If they didn’t act like idiots it could have been a real page-turner instead of a headache. It’s disappointing because Freida can write some great plots, but the characters’ antics completely overshadowed the story. I was left feeling frustrated instead of thrilled.Sydneythe main character, might just be the most infuriating fmc I’ve ever encountered in a book. Her choices drove me up the wall and left me questioning whether she had any common sense at all. Instead of making logical decisions or even considering seeking help when she obviously need it, she seemed hell-bent on making everything worse. Every time she ignored glaring warning signs or failed to connect the dots my patience wore thinner and thinner until I was practically tearing my hair out.I was initially engaged in the story—there was potential for something intriguing. But with every ridiculous choice she made, I found myself pulled right out of it. Take, for instance, the fact that she gets catfished and then stalked by a man. You’re telling me she doesn’t do anything about it? It’s as if she’s living in a bubble where common sense doesn’t exist.And then, as if the situation couldn’t get any worse, she meets a hot man, and suddenly all those red flags vanish as if they never existed. 🤡\xa0Just like that her interest in finding her best friend’s murderer seems to evaporate. It’s infuriating to watch her completely disregard the very real dangers surrounding her. The lack of self-awareness is truly mind-boggling. She tumbles from one disaster to another as if she’s in a constant state of denial and it’s exhausting to witness.Her inability to grow or evolve made it nearly impossible to stay invested in her journey—I wasn’t invested at all. I had no desire to root for her I was simply left exasperated wondering if she’d ever figure it out.Tom'spov is told in the past tense when he was 16. I found this narrative choice really interesting because it added a captivating layer as I tried to piece together the story from different timelines. However, Freida’s approach to Tom kind of took the wind out of the thriller’s sails.It felt like she didn’t even try to conceal that he was a psychopath. Instead of building tension, it seemed like she was just throwing in every crazy thought and bizarre fetish she could come up with, almost for shock value. His obsession with his girlfriend, Daisy, was bizarre but at the same time he had this strange fixation on seeing her die. It was such a wild mix that I found myself wondering whether I should be horrified or rolling my eyes.And then there were these really annoying and unnecessary moments when he wondered whether Slug (the bug eater) was his bff or not it felt like Freida was trying way too hard to make Tom seem unpredictable but instead it came off as overly theatrical and less believable. I just couldn’t take his character seriously.Sure, there was a plot twist that actually made my jaw drop and had me rethinking everything I just read but the rest of it was meh. Freida usually nails the gripping stories but this one fell flat because the characters were just so frustratingly clueless and dumb. Sydney in particular had rocks for brains that I couldn’t help but be pulled right out of the story. The premise had a ton of potential, but instead of building suspense, the characters’ antics just overshadowed everything. I found myself rolling my eyes way more than I was thrilled.Don’t even get me started on the epilogue—it just pissed me off even more I swear it has to be the worst one Freida has ever written.If you’re looking for a fast-paced thriller and don’t mind dealing with frustratingly dumbass characters that make you want to bang your head against the wall then I’d say give it a try. I’ll still check out her other books, but this one just didn’t do it for me.────⋆.˚ ✩ ⋆˙⟡────Freida drops a new book so of course I will be reading!""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Yalll.

What a ride'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""➳ 3.25 ☆this book has better narrative structure than some of her newer releases. i enjoyed this to a certain extent, and the book kept me guessing until the very end. in typical freida style, the women are jejune, banal, and unfledged characters who are all somehow obsessed with doormat pieces of shit with zero functioning braincells. there is really only onemajor twisti can think of, and maybe that's why this worked better, as it seemed more logical than her other outlandish reveals. however, i always have a fun time with these, as i am here for the lunacy, not scholarly work.this story essentially follows our main character : sydney shaw, who has a horrible dating/relationship history with men.this so real to be honest. syndey, living in the big apple state, meets her new boyfriend who seems perfect for her.is it too good to be true?there are some brutal murders that start to take place close in proximity to her, and she now wonders if thisperfectman—isn't soperfect?this is easily one of her more 'thriller'esque books, as opposed to something likethe teacher. thankfully this book isn't over the top and theatrical like some of her other novels. however, surprise, the main character is useless and childish, but i already had that expectation going in, it didn’t ruin the plot/book for me. however, given the pacing of the book—coupled with the reveals—i would argue this is one of her better works.i also found out hasTWO??more book lined up... dr. mcfadden works overtime.""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Shein - fast fashion… Freida - fast fashion of writing? 🤔Let me tell yall why this book pissed me off soo bad!

She didn’t trust anything she saw, heard or felt. “I saw KJ”, or “was that really KJ?

She is a go-to author for most, but for me it seems she’s been on a roll, kicking out 3-4 mid/average books every year without GAF about the quality or make sensibility of it all! It’s giving quantity/quality for meeee. The shein of writing! Good and potentially thrilling in the moment, but after the fact, you discover holes and loose seams.Listen, some books make me livid.

He is obsessed with her and wants to make her his girlfriend.I tried to explain the plot the less spoilery possible!It doesn’t seem much but the less you know in Freida’s books, the better!➷my thoughts:since it’s a thriller I never really talk about the characters or other important things to avoid ruining the plot for other people.I really liked and enjoyed this book. Do I think is that good to have a 4 star rating? Probably not,but god I HAD FUN. And the plot twist GOT ME.I was so sure I got Freida this time but she said, not today bitch, I’m getting you.The book keeps you suspecting everyone, trying to connect the dots and the timelines,with an incredible EASY writing and pace to follow.My main advice on this authors books is to flow, to think the less amount of theories possible and just enjoy the twisted ride.I will keep reading all the books she releases. Not all of them are good, but they just FLY by.if someone wants to start reading Freida, I would recommend to start with the housemaid ( only the first book tho) and never lie.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Thank you to Poisoned Pen Press/ Sourcebooks for a physical ARC of this highly anticipated release in exchange for my honest thoughts.

The Boyfriend is a annoying-mind-fucked thriller novel with stupid characters who refuse to use their two brain cells.I couldn't tolerate a single character in this book.Sydneywas too childish and desperate to have a husband and baby. She was blinded by all of it. She sees a perfect man and the next second she is planning to have babies with him. She's just a classic pick me up girl.Tomwas a psychopath with a weird obsession of seeing his girlfriend die?Daisywas annoying with her crazy girl obsessed antics.Slug the bug eaterdisgusted me. The only normal one wasJake, the detective and Sydney's ex-boyfriend.Randywas creepy andGretchengave me suspicious vibes from the start.Kevinis a man-child.The rest are dead.This is also the synopsis of this book but add a murder mystery about some girls killed by a man who dates them and then torture and kills them. That's how The Boyfriend was born.Anyway, I had a good time with this book. I needed a fast paced thriller and the past and present timelines kept me hooked and entertained so I guess it was not a total waste. As usual I did not see the big plot-twist coming but it wasn't jaw-dropping or mind-blowing. Unexpected but not shocking.The epilogue frustrated me. Freida always writes good epilogues in her books with a little plot-twist and open ending at the end but this one is my least favourite by Freida.To Shanaaya,I couldn't have finished this book without you keeping me company and listening to my rants. We should do more thriller and mystery buddy reads and I had so much fun reading this book with you. I am sure we can give Freida better ideas for plot-twists in her next books.—————she writes. i read. its as simple as that.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""4 Stars!👑THE QUEEN IS BACK YA'LL!!!!👑The way i devoured this book in a couple of hours is proof enough of how good it was. It has been proved. Freida never sleeps and throws out banging thrillers one after the other. Her writing itself is enough for you to not stop reading. It just sucks you in. And to top that off hertwists are mind blowing. This was another one of her classic thrillers with:🗡️ Complex characters🧑\u200d🤝\u200d🧑🗡️ Dual timelines⌚🗡️ TWIST i never saw coming 🤯🗡️ Fast paced 🏃\u200d♀️🗡️ Killer Epilogue 🤭I won't lie i did think by the halfway point that it all seems pretty obvious and that this was like a lot other thillers i've read before. I was going to give it a 3 star at most. One thing I did not like is how the women are portrayed to be ignoring all the red flags and blindly trusting the guy.But i should know not to doubt Freida or judge her books atleast until i read the whole thing. The twist just changed my entire perspective of this and i won't stop gushing. I just can't. Everyone needs to read this rn!! Slump or no slump it'll get you back on track and remind you why we love reading so damn much!!📚~~~~~~~girl you just released a book and you already have two more lined up😭like I really wanna read all of them keep em coming.. But you do sleep and do other things right??? Where do all these fantastic plots come from? 😭🥰 anyhow can't wait to read this one❤""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Wow! I’m addicted to McFadden’s writing—her unpredictable, mind-blowing twists, brilliant sense of humor, and fast-paced, short chapters that keep me hooked! I love her books! I know reading is subjective—you don’t have to like her characters or may even find them naive, questioning their intelligence with harsh adjectives. Honestly, I don’t care! For me, I enjoy the inner thoughts of her seemingly naive characters, which often make me laugh because of the sarcasm and dark humor in their thoughts and actions. (Criticizing heroines for panicking and making mistakes is like questioning why blonde women in horror movies always die first or how the 'final girl' manages to survive, even if she’s not a genius!)The story revolves around Sydney, a 34-year-old accountant living in a nice New York apartment. Recently heartbroken after her breakup with her detective boyfriend Jake, Sydney’s financial situation doesn't match her unlucky love life. She dives into the dating pool through a popular app, but her recent dates have been disastrous. Her last date, Kevin, even attempted to assault her on the street, turning into a stalkerish nightmare. Thankfully, she’s saved by a mysterious stranger that night, but she doesn't hear from them again—until fate brings them together after her best friend, who lived in her apartment, is brutally murdered.We also get flashbacks of Tom’s past, though his identity isn’t revealed immediately. Tom, a nice and sweet high school boy, befriends an awkward outcast nicknamed Slug, and falls in love with Daisy, the police chief's daughter. But Tom’s darker instincts slowly drag him into a whirlwind of tragedies, including the deaths of young women in his neighborhood.How will Sydney and Tom’s paths cross? Has Sydney unknowingly invited danger into her life?If you want to know more, hop on McFadden’s fright train and read this in one sitting! It’s guaranteed fun, as always. McFadden’s thrill rides never disappoint!Anyway, I enjoyed this book! Interestingly, I even enjoyed the flashbacks to Tom’s story. I found Sydney, the main heroine, tolerable, especially since I laughed out loud every time her mother called with awkward reminders about her biological clock ticking! The smart twist left me speechless—even the sharpest reader wouldn’t see it coming. I also enjoyed the ending! The pacing was great, as usual, and the way Sydney’s present-day POV intertwined with Tom’s past was surprisingly well done.Overall: I’m giving this 4 stars! It’s a captivating, heart-pounding page-turner—highly entertaining popcorn reading!medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Why does Freida McFadden write women who hate themselves ???This started horribly as I think I wasn’t a fan of the narration, it significantly improved when I switched to paperback.And I ended up really enjoying it for the easy to read factor. There was a great twist as always - dare I say, I think this is one of Freida’s better books. But do bare in mind with this author, they are very much popcorn thrillers, so manage expectations :)'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""THE BOYFRIEND is my favorite Freida McFadden to date. I said what I said. I've really been enjoying thrillers that infuse dating/romance/dark f'd up partners lately (I wonder why) and THE BOYFRIEND fits the bill! The story is centered around Sydney Shaw, a mid-30s year old woman living in New York trying to navigate online dating. When a date goes awry, Sydney ends up meeting someone who ends up being everything she'd want in a relationship. He is charming, handsome, confident, and a physician. As the two begin to date, Sydney starts suspecting that her new relationship isn't as stable as she thought it was, especially when a string of deaths start popping up. These murders involve women around her age demographic.I almost gave this book 5 stars because it was so much fun, but I immediately clocked what was going to happen (for the most part) early on. That didn't take away from my enjoyment, but I wish the secrets were held a bit better. This book is juicy and fun in all the best ways, and I did get tricked with one of the twists, so I was pleasantly surprised at some of the developments. This is an easy read for sure and won't be anything you haven't seen before in thrillers, but the way the story is told really is a fun journey. I definitely would recommend any Freida fans to pick this one up because it really is a fun, mindless, escape. I definitely needed this read to take my mind of ~life~ lately. This book will be perfect for a vacation read or a rainy day read because you will get lost in the story. I have mixed opinions about this author, but I definitely do not with THE BOYFRIEND.""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '⭑ ⭑ ⭒ ⭒ ⭒2.3 stars“THE ENDDid you enjoy reading The Boyfriend?”NO I FUCKING DIDN’T.PUT THE PEN DOWN FREIDA😭‼️'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""౨ৎׄ ˖ ݁𖥔🩸 ݁𖥔˖ . ─── 4.0★ 〬𓂂 🔪ׄThe Boyfriendis a story i really enjoyed. Although the pacing can feel a bit slow at times, it's clear that every detail is carefully planned to connect all the pieces and lead you to the final plot twist, which leaves you completely shocked. I didn’t see any of it coming, really. Freida makes you distrust everyone.One thing that characterizes Freida McFadden is her ability to keep the reader’s interest. Her chapters, although very short, always end with a small mystery that leaves you wanting to read one more... and then another. This makes the book addictive, even when some chapters might feel a bit “boring” since not much happens, but in each chapter, there’s a clue.I think the ending plays with the perceptions you have of the characters and makes you question what you thought you knew from the beginning.The big plot twist reveals how certain details that seemed insignificant or disconnected make sense in the last chapters. It’s an ending that leaves that“WHAT?!!!”feeling, but at the same time, it makes sense when you look back at the clues it left.Overall,The Boyfriendis a captivating read, full of unexpected twists that are worth it. While the story's buildup takes its time, the final result makes the wait worthwhile.I would definitely recommend it.""}, {'rating': None, 'content': 'I want to read everything she writes.'}]"

I swear this might be the most beautiful book written this year. It's all things good and all things pure. If you haven't read it yet, trust me, you are missing out on something special 😭Roman Carver Kitt has my heart. Everything he does is sheer perfection and his love for Iris speaks volumes. Book boyfriend material? Heck no. He is husband material 🥹❤~•~•~Original Review(July 2023)I DID NOT SIGN UP FOR SO MUCH PAIN 😭💔 My heart is in pieces after that ending. Why did y'all not warn me 😭😭Did I love it?Absolutely with my whole heart.Was it perfect or flawed?It was absolutely perfect. I wouldn't change a thing.Does it end on a brutal cliffhanger?A BIG FAT YES. Am gonna be crying for days.In a slump after Fourth Wing?Grab this book.THIS IS YOUR SIGN TO BUY IT. IT IS WORTH THE MONEYYYYYYY'all can probably tell how much I loved this book. The people are not lying, this is worth the hype.✔️ Read if you like Shadow and Bone✔️ Historical fantasy romance✔️ Rivals to lovers✔️ Pen palsIris (FMC)andRoman (MMC)have been working and competing for the position of a columnist alongside each other at the local newspaper. There's no denying that there's spark between the two but can they overcome the rivalry as the war of gods loom over. Amidst the brutal war and magical creatures, finding solace in letters, in each other's company seems to fill them with hope and something more.Theworld buildingis not too complex, it might seem that way in the beginning but the author sets the stage brilliantly. Never info dumping, she paces the history of the towns, the platoons, the creatures and the gods-Enva and Dacrebeautifully. The typewriters sure are an interesting feature. It came so naturally and was so easy to read, love when authors do it right. Thepacingis consistent, not too fast not too slow. I was so mesmerized by her writing, the story and the characters, I was envisioning it all and didn't know where the time went.One of the underrated things is the way the author dealt with heavy topics-war, grief and loss of lifeplay a big part in this book. So if any of the things feel uncomfortable, do reconsider as it is a very emotional book. The way it's depicted and the sheer raw emotion written wasbeautifully heartbreaking to read.There were side characters who were just there for a few pages but they made me cry. They made an impact. The words they carried were powerful.Thecharactersmade this story so amazing.💠Iris-She is such an interesting and lovable FMC. Although she is just 18 but there's so much maturity to her. The way we see her struggles, battling emotions and presenting a tough exterior for her brother, for her mother and whoever close to her- is commendable. The way she is ready to protect others and put others first is beautiful to see.✒️Roman-I loved him from page 1 itself. A 19 year old with zeal. A bit grumpy in the beginning but there are reasons for that. The way he was dead set on doing anything and everything for Iris 🤌 The way he was never shy to show love. The way he was never held Iris back. The way he fell for her ❤️\u200d🔥 He is full of charms and wit and ready to be with Iris no matter what.Need me a Roman 😭His story about Del made me sob NGL.Thesupporting charactersare a nice addition to Iris and Roman's and the gods story. I likedAttiea lot and am sure I will love Lilac too. I likedMarisoland her 'mom energy' andKeegantoo however short a while we see her for.Forestis sure an interesting character and I won't elaborate on it further due to spoilers. Y'all but I really want to seeSarahachieve her dream 😭Theromancewas PERFECT 🤌 It's so deliciously sweet and swoon worthy, I fell in love with their love. The chemistry is present right from the beginning. I loved how both of them are so into each other and especially Roman, who is never afraid to show it. The sweet spicy moment in a YA book was beautiful to read. I loved how their relationship developed and grew stronger and stronger.Theendingabsolutely broke me. I knew something would go wrong but had no idea of the intensity of it. It was such a brutal cliffhanger and with the epilogue, am crying again just by thinking about it.I cannot recommend it enough y'all. Easily one of the best books I read this year. It's definitely going to be one of my favourites ever and I already cannot wait to reread it. Books like these make me realise why I love reading so much 🥺❤️ I honestly want to protect and cherish my copy of it.HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDGuys, just trust me.~•~•~LET'S GOOO 🙌🤞~•~•~Eep my copy just arrived and it is so beautiful. Cannot wait to get to it, have high hopes""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""How did the promise of a war between gods turn into a middling historical fiction with a lackluster romance and nary a whiff of fantasy? I'm honestly a bit stunned.I went intoDivine Rivalswith high expectations. I'd seen the gushing reviews and the deluge of 5-star ratings. And I'd gotten a taste for romantasy and I wanted more. In fact, I was so certain I was going to love this that I saved it for just the right moment when I'd need a little extra zing in my reading repertoire.So I settled myself in, ready to be swept away in a fantasy of epic proportions, with an enemies-to-lovers romance for the ages. And how can it not be amazing, with gods at war and two rivaling journalists who don't fight with their swords but with their words. Yes! Except no, because this didn't really deliver on any of it.Instead, what I got was more or less a historical fiction. The fantasy element is so diminutive, I felt like I could blink and miss it. You see, the gods were unhappy with each other, and they're recruiting humans to fight in their war. And that's pretty much it for the fantasy part. Oh, and there's some magic in old houses and typewriters. You can see how that would be disappointing for a reader expecting, well, more than that.The majority of the story is told from Iris's perspective and she never really gelled into an interesting character for me. At every step, she does what you would expect a character to do, nothing more, nothing less. Her brother is fighting in the war, so she misses him. She sees an opportunity to join the war effort, so she does. There's a cute boy at the office, so she's attracted to him. But there's another nice boy she writes with, so she's attracted to him too. At no point did she surprise me in any way. I found Roman to be the more compelling character, but his perspective is only a little bit here and there.As for the romance, it was serviceable but ultimately uninspiring. There was no real chemistry, no banter, no spark, nothing that made me swoon or crack a smile. The majority of it played out via Iris and Roman's letters to each other, and they felt distinctly YA. The writing was deep in the way of teenagers, but much ado about nothing for old folks like me. In fact, it reminded me of AOL chat logs from back in the day. I wonder if I were to dig up my own from my teenage days, it would come up similarly bland and overwrought.That isn't to say I didn't enjoy any of it because I did. But I kept waiting for that moment when the words I'm reading on the page would turn into an immersive experience, and it never did. Every element in here—the war, the fantasy, the characters, their writing, the romance—was pleasant enough to while away a few hours, but in that take it or leave it kind of way.No one's more disappointed than me. Compared to what I had imagined in my head, this story paled in comparison. But to be fair, part of that was my fault. What I wanted and what I got were complete opposites. I'm a huge fan of romance and fantasy, which this isn't really, and not a fan of wartime historical fiction, which is all this is.For all my complaints, I did get some enjoyment out of it. And since it's a duology and I already own the second book, I'll go ahead and finish the series. Fingers crossed that the second book has more of the exciting elements I'm looking for.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

I’m tired of having to rearrange my life after the people within it depart, as if I’m a puzzle and I’m now missing pieces and I will never feel that pure sense of completion again.”iris:incredible protagonist. the way she thinks, acts and speaks is so amazing, and her love for people she cares about is so so beautiful. also she is incredibly mature, the way she takes care of her drunk mother and works to keep them alive is so heartbreaking. she wears an armor everyday, hiding her family’s poverty, never asking for reassurance even though she feels alone in the world and trying to stand up on her own feet by working her ass of for a job she wants so passionately is so admirable. her seeking the truth at all costs, staying strong while her mom’s showing reckless actions, putting her family above her, not needing anyone and defending herself by her own, knowing her value, wanting to be beautiful just for herself, telling herself she doesn’t needs her mother’s reassurance but gets bolstered when gets it, not crying in front of people, hating when her boss made her resignation sounds like she is giving up, remembering small details about her friends, afraid to love people because she always lose them.. if i see someone saying she is unlikable, watch under your bed bc i’m hiding there.. with a knife 🔪”But if I’ve learned anything from those fools, it is that to be vulnerable is a strength that most of us fear. It takes courage to let down your armor, to welcome people to see you as you are. Sometimes I feel the same as you: I can’t risk having people behold me as I truly am. But there’s also a small voice in the back of my mind, a voice that tells me, ‘You will miss so much by being so guarded.”her mind is spectacular, she talks about how much she was hungry, not just for food but for sober conversations with her mother. and the way she uses words; she ‘bled’ herself in her articles and letters, not having motivation and describing the blank page as ‘nothing more than stars and smoke and word pressed on a page’, her writing to roman but also writingfor herself, her understanding how close she can be to people, yet how far away and lonely she can fell.. she is so mature and i get chills every time we get a scope of her articles and letters.“I don’t think you realize how strong you are, because sometimes strength isn’t swords and steel and fire, as we are so often made to believe. Sometimes it’s found in quiet, gentle places. The way you hold someone’s hand as they grieve. The way you listen to others. The way you show up, day after day, even when you are weary or afraid or simply uncertain. That is strength, and I see it in you.”roman:how to put this man’s selflessness, maturity, smartness and passion to words… he is the most well behaved, smart, dedicated and well spoken man i have ever read.you know miscommunication? reverse it and make it a character and you have roman fucking kitt.his maturity level is reachless, he apologized to iris the second the understood his words came out offensive (unintentionally), asked her if she wants to talk when she looks bothered, said to her that she’ll never be alone, asked for a final assignment since he believes that he had a unfair advantage; you literally can see he cares, not only hear by his words. he doesn’t just sees her, he seesthroughher.honestly i believe that i can make you love him by listing his actions and not even adding my thoughts about him;he quitted his dream job, broke his engagement, stood against his father’s expectations to travel hundreds of kilometers on a train that broke down and walked his way through the war just to be with the girl he loves.this is not enough? okay,he was the only one to check her when she didn’t show up at work, waited behind her door until he was sure that she locked it, gets so worried about her being wounded that he couldn’t bear to sit and wondered through till 3am, rereads all the letters that iris has sent to him every night before bed, crawled to her while he was bleeding and dying, trying to reach her in his last breath.HE PRACTICALLY DIED FOR HER.“I pray that my days will be long at your side. Let me fill and satisfy every longing in your soul. May your hand be in mine, by sun and by night. Let our breaths twine and our blood become one, until our bones return to dust.

A sublime feast that fed me on days when I was starving.”My Iris,"" he said, ""there is no question that you are the brave one, all on your own.""I absolutely loved and adored Iris’ character sm. One of my favorite fmcs. Rebecca’s way of portraying her was amazing to see unfold and develop. The tone for her dialogue felt so wise, mature and strong willed. I felt the need to protect her and let her know she wasn’t alone even though she felt that way. But she didn’t need that bc she was self sufficient all on her own“But I realize that people are just people, and they carry their own set of fears, dreams, desires, pains, and mistakes. I can’t expect someone else to make me feel complete; I must find it on my own.”She exemplified such strength, bravery, selflessness and determination despite the loneliness and hardships she experienced. I felt like I connected with her and saw her in myself (we love the relatability) and all the way through I was rootingg for her“Get a grip on yourself, she thought, hands on her knees, eyes closed. This is war. This is what you signed up for. Don’t look away from it.”Roman was just so kind, so soft with her, so infuriatingly handsome (in my head), mine and everyone else’s book husband as of now, and so selfless as he dropped everything to follow her! as if I didn’t already love him and he goes and does that while also protecting her with his life. **Roman really made it difficult for me to enjoy a romance when it comes to my expectations in how a man speaks tomethe fmc in a book 😩 I legit melted every time he’d say her name (I imagine it’s soft)“Iris,” he whispered.”soo much whispering but I get why“You and I … we need to stay together. We’re better this way.”“I think you and I are simply better together, Kitt.”I loved the addition of the small found family she found in Marisol and Attie. It warmed my heart to know she had this as she really deserved to have itShe realized this was her family now. That there were bonds that ran deeper than blood.”There were minimal fantasy elements in this but the story on its own was amazing to not to care sm for it. But I have hope the inclusion of the gods is expanded upon further in the next book esp as their characters felt more like an introduction to them in this———————————————Ultimately, this was written so impeccable with such a compelling plot and I was in complete awe because of it. The romance wasexquisite, as was the characterization and the connection between them in their trauma and grief endured. The war aspect was also written in great detail as well with the angst of it depicted for how it truly is and what it’s like.I’m gonna need the next book asap as I have so many questions than answers in what happens next after that cliffhanger??Thank you emara for putting me on to this <33Quotes I loved:“I am coming to love him, in two different ways. Face to face, and word to word.”“The way you show up, day after day, even when you are weary or afraid or simply uncertain. That is strength, and I see it in you.”“Little flower,” I see it now. The name suits you.P.S. Hi, Iris.”“Kissing him in the dark was entirely different from kissing him in the light.”“I can’t risk having people behold me as I truly am. But there\'s also a small voice in the back of my mind, a voice that tell me, You will miss so much by being so guarded”“I rarely share this part of my life with others, but I want to tell it to you now. A piece of armour, because I trust you. A glint of falling steel, because I feel safe with you.”“Roman Cheeky Kitt. Roman Cantankerous Kitt. Roman Conceited Kitt.”“I want to know everything about you, Iris. I want to know your hopes and your dreams. I want to know what irritates you and what makes you smile and what makes you laugh and what you long for most in this world.”“He began to see the invisible threads that drew him to Iris. It didn\'t feel like fate; Roman didn\'t quite believe in such fancies. But it certainly felt like something. Something that was now stealing his sleep and making his chest ache with each breath”“Your grief will never fully fade; it will always be with you — a shadow you carry in your soul — but it will become fainter as your life becomes brighter. You will learn to live outside of it again, as impossible as that may sound”'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '""What the hell are you doing here, Kitt?""she demanded, shoving his chest.""Have you lost your mind?""She felt his hands slide down her back, resting on the curve of her hips.

The sweet romance? The story? Was it the fact that, despite not being part of the age group this was targeted at, I saw myself in both the main characters and could relate to their personal arc, both individually and as a couple?I have no idea, but if I had to try a guess, I\'d say it\'s simply a combination of all these things, plus the fact that Rebecca Ross is a crazy talented author.I\'ve had the chance to discover her just recently, after reading a book that\'d been on my tbr since 2017, and I\'m glad to conclude she\'s gotten even better with time and experience.Divine Rivals is abook I recommend going into blindly and one I definitely can\'t see anyone savoring slowly. Once you get into it, stopping is as hard as breathing under water.Rooting for the main characters to find themselves will become a new hobby, but rooting for them to find happiness by finding each other, will become an obsession.The progression from rivals to lovers is so smooth, almost soothing in its naturality.The setting is atmospheric, described so perfectly you can almost smell the stinging scent of gunpowder, hear the crinkle of the paper and the click of Iris and Roman\'s writing machine\'s keys.I don\'t know why, but while reading it, I couldn\'t stop thinking of one of my favorite movies,Un long dimanche de fiançailles. They have really similar vibes and not because they both take place during a war and tell the story of two very unfortunate lovers, but also because of the gray-ish undertones, the raw portrayal of reality, and the bittersweet romance.I like to consider myself pretty experienced when it comes to the reading scene, but those last pages made me feel like I was on a literal rollercoaster, even though I kind of saw it all coming.I didn\'t expect the pain to be so powerful, probably. It wasn\'t until the end that I realized just how invested I am in the magical realism of this story and the delicious pain that comes with this romance.Speaking of romance. I\'m at a loss of words for how perfect it plainly was.These two simply can\'t not be together. THEY CAN\'T.Roman is adorable, a real gentleman and the most cinnamon roll to ever roll, but for me, Iris stole the show. I admire her so much and my heart cried for how strong and brave she always was, despite everything she had to endure.I can\'t wait for the sequel to come out, even tho, I\'ll admit, I am also a little scared of what will and could happen in it.I hope that, if Rebecca Ross eventually decides to break my heart with Ruthless Vows, she wrecks it neatly so that it\'ll have the strenght to heal properly.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'world building ? don’t know her'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'alexa, play the great war by taylor swift.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""”their names would be entwined—roman and iris or winnow and kitt because could you truly have one without the other?”i fell in love with this book the moment i saw it and reading it made me fall even harder. the beauty of this book is unreal.”a piece of armor, because i trust you. a glint of falling steel, because i feel safe with you.”this book had such beautiful writing. the descriptive imagery had me so easily immersed in the story. it felt like i was a part of the book. the magic fascinated me. and most importantly: i adored roman and iris. they are one of my most special couples.one thing i did not expect going into this experience was for it to make me as emotional as it did. i had tears in my eyes during many chapters. the words on the pages spoke to me. i connected with these characters so much more than i thought i would.“i think about how effortless it is to lose oneself in words, and yet also find who you are.”my favourite part has to be the letters between roman and iris. anyone that knows me knows that letters make me go weak in the knees. reading their exchanges really touched and warmed my heart. there’s something about writing your deepest thoughts and feelings without any eyes on you, and knowing the person on the other side isn’t judging you, that you are not alone. the letters gave us so much insight into roman & iris. we really get to feel their emotions with them, and a lot of it is so relatable.iris winnow-”i’m not afraid to be alone, but i’m tired of being the one left behind. i’m tired of having to rearrange my life after the people within it depart, as if i’m a puzzle and i’m now missing pieces and i will never feel that pure sense of completion again.”she is honestly such a lovely character. i think anyone can see themselves in iris. her emotions and life experiences are very relatable. one of the things i love so much about her is that she’s not afraid to take risks. with her life or her heart. she puts herself out there and she’s ready to accept whatever the consequences are. she doesn’t shy away from anything. and roman is right, she is brave and strong. she went through so much in this book and she is still fighting. she is still surviving. she’s very inspiring.roman kitt-”i don't think you realize how strong you are, because sometimes strength isn't swords and steel and fire, as we are so often made to believe. sometimes it's found in quiet, gentle places.”now where do i find me one? im being so deadass. anyways i need him. he’s a little more apprehensive to open up, but when he does you really see he’s the biggest softie on the inside. the way he would drop anything for her, he would die for her, he lives and breathes iris winnow. he rereads her letters every night. he constantly uplifts her. he knows exactly what she needs at any given moment and its so sweet. iris says jump he asks how high?! he would actually do anything for her and i love that for my best girl.”i think there is a magical link between you and me. a bond that not even distance can break.”i love how when we get each of their povs, they always mention how much they love the others’ laugh and how much joy it brings them. its so small but its always the little things that stick with me and win my heart.“you will miss so much by being so guarded.”i loved this book but i do have to say the world building and the description of the gods was definitely lacking. but the characters themselves don’t even seem to understand their world or why they’re at war so i guess i shouldn’t really expect too much from that. maybe in book 2?also, i felt a disconnect between iris / attie / marisol. i was not picking up what they were putting down. i see that they formed some sort of bond during such a stressful time, but when iris was calling them “home” and her “found family” i was like what? is the found family in the room with us? did i miss a couple chapters because yall were giving roomates at best. there was more telling than showing in that aspect if im being honest.anyways i just know when i think back on this book its always gonna be beautiful memories because what will stick with me is how much i adored the writing and irisroman together. ♡”you are worthy of love. you are worthy to feel joy right now, even in the darkness.”""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '♾/5 ☆“you are worthy of love. You are worthy to feel joy right now, even in the darkness. And just in case you’re wondering… I’m not going anywhere, unless you tell me to leave, and even then, we might need to negotiate.”I honestly didn\'t know what to expect going into this book. I went into it knowing that it is listed as a YA fantasy but didn\'t expect to fall in love with it this much! I had seen so many good things about this, but the reviews just don\'t do it justice. This has become one of my favorite reads for this year!Divine Rivals is the first book in the Letters of Enchantment duet. This is my first book by Rebecca Ross, and I fell in love with it from the very first word, which surprised me since I usually don\'t enjoy third person. Her writing is so beautiful and poetic that it just captured me. Though this is a fantasy, there are some missing pieces to the world building, but as I was reading, I completely overlooked it due to the romance that was present. It\'s a slow burn, work place academic rivals to lovers, where he falls first and harder this always makes me swoon so hard, romantacy that is emotional with angst, tension, grief, death and so much pain that I hadn\'t been expecting.Iris Winnow and Roman Kitt are two young rival journalists. They work at the same newspaper the Oath Gazette and find themselves competing for the same columnist position. While the rivalry between them grows, so does a war that is between the two gods, Dacre and Enva. The two find solace within each other through two magical typewrites that are linked through their letters. Iris begins sharing her daily thoughts and her deepest griefs, and he does in return.""Sometimes I’m afraid to love other people. Everyone I care about eventually leaves me, whether it’s death or war or simply because they don’t want me.""""I realize that people are just people, and they carry their own set of fears, dreams, desires, pains, and mistakes. I can’t expect someone else to make me feel complete; I must find it on my own.""Iris Winnowis so strong, brave, and just precious and needs to be protected at all costs. I absolutely adore this woman. She\'s so mature for her young age and has so much to deal with in her everyday struggles, but she doesn\'t let it affect the way she carries herself and cares for others. I was so happy that she found her own family since all the people she\'s loved have left her in one way or another.\xa0 I just want to wrap my arms around her and give her the biggest hug.""But just in case you were wondering… I’ll gladly read whatever you write.""“You mentioned the other day that you think I’m only here to ‘outshine’ you. But that’s the furthest thing from the truth. I broke my engagement, quit my job, and traveled six hundred kilometers into war- torn land to be with you, Iris.”Roman C. Kittis grumpy and stubborn in the beginning, but when the layers start to peel back and we are left with the sweetest, kindest, gentleman that I swear you will ever meet. He had me absolutely swooning. His life seems so perfect from the outside, but he has so many struggles that make me love him even more. I won\'t go into detail as I want you to fall in love with him as I did. He goes through great lengths for Iris to show how much she means to him and cares for her. I mean, he stands outside her door and waits for her to lock it before he leaves. He raises the bar for real men, and I\'ve just added a new book boyfriend to the long list.""He didn’t want to live in a world without her and her words.""""She couldn’t bear to live in a world without him.""""“I think you and I are simply better together, Kitt,”""Their names would be entwined—Roman and Iris or Winnow and Kitt because could you truly have one without the other?""RomanIrisare the definition of soulmates. Their chemistry is so palpable from the very beginning, even as they were still rivals. Iris gave Roman the following nicknames Roman Cheeky Kitt. Roman Cantankerous Kitt. Roman Conceited Kitt and I loved them all. They had me giggling and kicking my feet. The way that he would do anything for her and the love he has for her words had me on my knees swooning. Their love for each other was felt through every moment on the pages. And the letters they wrote to each other are everything and so much more! They were making up some of my favorite parts. I need someone to write me love letters NOW!Side charactersI absolutely adored the love and found family that Marisol, Attie, and Keegan shared with Iris. They are the family that Iris never knew she would need. The way that they became close knit so quickly and will always look out for and do anything for one another is so precious. Now Iris\' mother Aster and her brother Forest I\'m not sure how I feel about them. They both did things that I couldn\'t fully agree with. I\'m hoping for some redemption from Forest for what he did in the next book.""It’s odd, how quickly life can change, isn’t it? How one little thing like typing a letter can open a door you never saw. A transcendent connection. A divine threshold.""That cliffhanger has me feeling so much. I was not expecting that ending at all. I will bepatiently ummmimpatiently waiting for the release of the next book because I have so many questions that I need answers for.Favorite moments/quotes""Perhaps it begins with one person. Someone you trust. You remove a piece of armor for them; you let the light stream in, even if it makes you wince. Perhaps that is how you learn to be soft yet strong, even in fear and uncertainty. One person, one piece of steel.""“I don’t want to wake up when I’m seventy- four only to realize I haven’t lived.”""I don’t think you realize how strong you are, because sometimes strength isn’t swords and steel and fire, as we are so often made to believe. Sometimes it’s found in quiet, gentle places. The way you hold someone’s hand as they grieve. The way you listen to others. The way you show up, day after day, even when you are weary or afraid or simply uncertain.""She unfortunately had to sit on Roman Kitt’s lap, nearly all the way to the front lines.~~Oh, how I would gladly take her place...“I prefer salty over sweet. I prefer sunsets over sunrises, but only because I love to watch the constellations begin to burn. My favorite season is autumn, because my mum and I both believed that’s the only time when magic can be tasted in the air. I am a devout tea lover and can drink my weight in it.”“I have the worst sweet tooth imaginable,” Roman began. “I prefer sunrises, but only because I like the possibilities a new dawn brings. My favorite season is spring, because baseball returns. I prefer coffee, although I’ll drink whatever is placed in front of me.”""It’s not a crime to feel joy, even when things seem hopeless. Iris, look at me. You deserve all the happiness in the world. And I intend to see that you have it.”“I think we all wear armor. I think those who don’t are fools, risking the pain of being wounded by the sharp edges of the world, over and over again.""“I pray that my days will be long at your side. Let me fill and satisfy every longing in your soul. May your hand be in mine, by sun and by night. Let our breaths twine and our blood become one, until our bones return to dust.

I wholly, truly and irrevocably fell in love with these two andtheir love.They areso so so preciousand I love them with my whole heart.“He didn’t answer, but his gaze held hers, and she thought she saw something flicker through him, like a star falling from the cosmos, or a coin underwater, reflecting the sun.

I mean how could I not whenRebecca\'s writing is this beautiful and exquisitethat I have no words to describe it. She just became one of my favourite authors with this book only. I loved the wayRebecca dealt with heavy topics like grief, loss of loved ones to war, healing and everything.The characters were well written that I could feel every emotion they felt.The connection between the main characters and side characterswas amazing. I liked Attie and Marisol and they both were amazing side characters.“I realize that people are just people, and they carry their own set of fears, dreams, desires, pains, and mistakes.

I mean its essential if its a rivals to lovers book.You know whats better than a book written in third pov?A well-written book in third pov and Rebecca just proved it.And I need more of Roman\'s povs but mostly I need the scene in his pov where Iris had to sit in his lap for 3 hours while they were travelling 🤭“She was glaring at him now. That fire in her eyes could have brought him to his knees.”The fantasy and the world building about the gods in their world was a bit underdeveloped.It was more about people and their fears related to war and how they fought and survived. Their world divided in two parts- Dacre\' s followers and those who were called upon by the goddess Enva to fight her wars. There was a little story mentioned about Dacre and Enva\'s feud and also the other gods but I wanted to know more about Dacre and Enva\'s story and exactly what happened between them that led to this war. And I still don\'t understand that why Enva was not their fighting in the war like Dacre was doing that. But I\'m also hoping we get all the answers in the sequel.➸ Iris WinnowI love this girl.She is so archer coded 🏹I loved reading her povs the most and as much as her inner monologues were painful they were also so damn relatable. She\'s been through the worst but I admire her for her strength, her kindness and resilience. She\'s just 18 but she\'s so mature and brave and I liked we saw her growth throughout the book. I saw her struggles and how she grew out of them and always found a way to be there for others and her family. I was also happy that she now has her own found family. Even if she lost everything she got a job as a war correspondent because she wanted to see her brother. She isone of the best FMCs\'I\'ve had a chance to read about this year.“I rarely share this part of my life with others, but I want to tell it to you now. A piece of armor, because I trust you. A glint of falling steel, because I feel safe with you.”➸ Roman Carver KittYes I\'m obsessed withRoman Cheeky Kittor was itRoman Cantankerous KittorRoman Conceited Kitt?!Whatever it was I just love this man so much. He is such a sweetheart and perfect in every way. He was a bit grumpy in the start but that was also hot.He\'s just 19 and well mannered and he waited for Iris to lock her door.I mean no real man would ever do this and its the basic thing everyone should know about. He is intelligent, charming and also witty. Where do I find him because I wanna marry him!! The way he fell for Iris and then took care for her whenever he could and the way he shared his story and his secrets with her even though he was a bit reticent to share them at first. I loved it.“Your letters have been a light for me to follow. Your words? A sublime feast that fed me on days when I was starving. I love you, Iris.”╰┈➤ Their relationshipThey had been working and competing against each other for the same position but they always had this spark between them and this undeniable chemistry.The rivals to lovers wasn\'t there muchbecause they were already attracted towards each other but I loved that they still bickered and bantered even after felling in love with each other. Roman brings out the fire in Iris and he protected her with his life everytime.“Going easy on me, then?” He arched a brow. “That’s surprising. We’re supposed to duel to the death.”“Has anyone ever told you that you squint when you lie?” His scowl only deepened.“No, but only because no one has spent as much time looking at me as you do, Winnow.”The letters they shared, the secrets and pain they wrote about in those letters, the way they let their armor fall one by one to be vulnerable with each other, the way they earned each others\' trust, the way Roman followed her to the war sight to be with her, their morning runs, the way they fell in love with each other, the way their loved grew stronger and stronger everyday. It was just mesmerisingly beautiful.They truly are ✨️SOULMATES✨️“I broke my engagement, quit my job, and traveled six hundred kilometers into war-torn land to be with you, Iris.”Their love was just so sweet and wholesome and aching and even the war couldn\'t taint it.Did everything between them was rushed after they fell in love?Yes.Did I mind it?Absolutely Not.Because it was war time and they didn\'t even knew if they had a chance to see each other next morning, so they did what they could do and it was perfect and reasonable. They can\'t just wait for the war to be over or be adults in their early 20s to get married when they already saw the brutal reality of war and what it could do to people.“You and I … we need to stay together. We’re better this way.”“I am coming to love him, in two different ways. Face to face, and word to word.”The ending completely shattered my heart in pieces.Why would Rebecca did this to me. They just found their happiness after so much pain and trauma and Rebecca just ripped it away from them and left them with so many regrets and pain. Iris couldn\'t even tell him how much she loved him and that asshole brother of her didn\'t even tried to save Roman?? I hate Forest and I don\'t believe a word he said and Rebecca better give us a happy ending for them in book 2 or I\'ll riot 🤺— Some other beautiful quotes —➸ “It takes courage to let down your armor, to welcome people to see you as you are. Sometimes I feel the same as you: I can’t risk having people behold me as I truly am. But there’s also a small voice in the back of my mind, a voice that tells me, “You will miss so much by being so guarded.”➸ “I am so afraid. And yet how I long to be vulnerable and brave when it comes to my own heart.”➸ “There are good days and there are difficult days. Your grief will never fully fade; it will always be with you— a shadow you carry in your soul— but it will become fainter as your life becomes brighter. You will learn to live outside of it again , as impossible as that may sound.”➸ “I don’t want to wake up when I’m seventy-four only to realize I haven’t lived.”➸ “Kissing him in the dark was entirely different from kissing him in the light. When the sun had gilded them hours ago, they had been eager and clumsy and hungry. But now, in the shadows of night, they were languid and thorough and curious.”➸ “I think about how effortless it is to lose oneself in words, and yet also find who you are.”To my emotional buddy read partner Rae 🫂 thankyou for hearing all my ramblings and screaming in our dm. You are the best and I can\'t wait to read another heartbreaking book with you.———————————————————————————Rae and I are definitely alergic to books with happy endings 😃 so here we are again to fall in love with this book just to let it break our hearts in the end.Br with my most beautiful girl Raerae 💗'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'DNF at 57%. I feel like I’ve read a completely different book to everyone else?I went in with high expectations due to the hype but ended up being disappointed. A great concept but it was poorly done.The lack of world building made me feel disconnected from the entire story.The characters lacked depth and the dialogue was cringy, especially the letters 😖The plot stumbled along, and the central war element was majorly underdeveloped. There was no suspense whatsoever from what you’d expect whilst living through a war.I just don’t get it 😞'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""This book had such a strong start. I was so intrigued by the mythology that for the first time maybe ever I really didn't care much about the romance. The middle of the book took me quite a bit of time to get through, but the end picked back up in a way that has me excited to read the sequel. I hope that the next book deals more with the myths and gods etc. Overall I'd say the plot was much stronger than the romance, which I didn't find myself particularly invested in.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Reread 25/12/2023:I stand by everything I said last time and more. This book is perfection. I did my reread with a mixture of paperback and audio. This was the first time I listened to the audio, the British narrators fit Iris and Roman so perfectly 🥹 Chapter 34, 36 & 39 have my entire heart. 5 stars isn\'t enough for this book,INFINITY STARS!! ♾️Despite the pain, I am SOOO excited for Ruthless Vows to come out today 🤩. I\'m going to savour it as much as I can because I don\'t want their story to end...⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆First read review 22/11/2023:★5 stars""He didn\'t want to live in a world without her and her words"";“She couldn\'t bear to live in a world without him""Probably the most surprised I\'ve been with how I felt about a book after reading it. I went into this book without really knowing what it was about, other than that it\'s a YA fantasy and super popular. What I wasn\'t expecting was howbeautifullywell written this book is. This book made me feel like I was wrapped in a warm blanket and Rebecca Ross\'s words gave me a big hug the whole time.To me, the concept of this book felt like it was a mix ofThe Hating Game, Beach Read and the Book Thiefwith elements of a dystopian fantasy.★The plot★This book follows Iris and Kitt who are both reporters working together and competing for the position of columnist at a newspaper called the Oath Gazette. This book is set in a historical period and a war between the gods Dacre and Enva is escalating and getting close to their homes in Oath. Iris is less fortunate and is experiencing hardship while Kitt initially appears to be a well educated, high society pretty boy with a sense of entitlement. The twist? Both Iris and Kitt have magical typewriters that send letters to each other and Iris doesn\'t know who the recipient is.╰⪼ThoughtsI was tossing up giving this book between 4 and 5 stars. Overall, I think the plot was probably 4 stars. I found it incredibly interesting and a unique take on a fantasy book intertwined with a historical fiction/romance. For a fantasy book, some people might find the world building wasn\'t massively present but I personally didn’t think it needed to be as it wasn\'t the main focus of this book. This book was received exactly the way it was intended to and was so much more than just another fantasy or romance book. The writing was a masterpiece and pushed this book to 5 stars for me.I loved that Rebecca didn\'t try to overwhelm the characters with a heroism or saviour complex concerning the war like most fantasy books would have done. By making Iris and Kitt correspondents you experienced the war and its effects through a raw lens. This book speaks to larger social issues, the importance of appreciating what you have, processing grief and shows the characters strength and resilience. Most importantly, this book showcasesthe power of words.The letterswere my favourite part about this entire book, you just have to read them for yourself to appreciate this.★Iris Winnow★Iris Enchanting Winnow, Iris Ethereal Winnow, Iris Exquisite Winnow, Iris Elizabeth Winnow.Ohh Iris I just wanted to give her a big hug the whole time. This poor girl went through so much at just 18 years old and was so emotionally mature. She had a lot of insecurity and had a hard time believing anyone could love her or do something kind for her without thinking they were making fun of her. She was so strong and compartmentalised her feelings to help others and do what needed to be done without question but she also had the ability to be so open to Kitt about her struggles and feelings. Her vulnerability when she had every reason not to be was so refreshing.""I am so afraid. And yet I long to be vulnerable and brave when it comes to my own heart.""★Roman Kitt★Roman Condescending Kit, Roman Upperclass Kit, Roman Confounded Kit, Roman Competitive Kit, Roman Chaffing Kit, Roman Cheeky Kit, Roman Cantankerous Kit, Roman Conceited Kitt and Roman Carver Kit 😭💗Again, Kitt was so emotionally mature for a 19 year old. His upbringing might have looked better than Iris\'s on the outside but he was battling an internal war with himself over the grief of his sister\'s death and his father\'s suffocating expectations of him. I loved that he fell first and his initial actions just reiterated how much she meant to him - that her words were hisinvisible stringholding him together. I loved watching his facade slowly crumble around him throughout this book, it was written so well.He followed her to war 😭 and the best part? He didn\'t go to convince her to go home or to sideline her. He just went to be with her because he couldn\'t stand to be away from her. He understood the importance of what they were doing and despite the risks, he didn\'t want to take anything away from her, just support her.""Iris! Iris, it\'s me, Kitt.""(sobbing) 🥹🎶I kept listing tothis is me trying, invisible string and tis the damn seasonby Taylor Swift while reading this and they just fit so well for Kitt and Iris🎶QuotesI honestly could keep rambling on about this and it\'s starting to feel like an open love letter but I\'ll leave you some of my favourite quotes:➸ “I’m tired of having to rearrange my life after the people within it depart, as if I’m a puzzle and I’m now missing pieces and I will never feel that pure sense of completion again.”➸ ""An then when you nabbed the first assignment and I read your article... I realised you were far more than I imagined. That my imagination was quite narrow.""➸ ""...His gaze held hers, and she thought she saw something flicker through him, like a star falling from the cosmos, or a coin underwater, reflecting the sun. Something fierce and vulnerable and very unexpected.""➸ ""While he had always been moved by her words to Forest, he realised that he felt pierced by all the words she had written for him. They made him ache.""➸""He began to see the invisible threads that drew him to Iris. It didn\'t feel like fate; Roman didn\'t quite believe in such fantasies. But it certainly felt like something. Something that was now stealing his sleep and making his chest ache with each breath.""➸ “I don’t think you realise how strong you are, because sometimes strength isn’t swords and steel and fire, as we are so often made to believe. Sometimes it’s found in quiet, gentle places.”➸ “The way you show up, day after day, even when you are weary or afraid or simply uncertain. That is strength, and I see it in you.”➸ “I rarely share this part of my life with others, but I want to tell it to you now. A piece of armour, because I trust you. A glint of falling steel, because I feel safe with you.”➸ ""If she wasn\'t so exhausted and stiff from the harrowing encounter they had miraculously survived, she would have knocked away his touch. She would have slapped him. She might have kissed him.""➸ ""What is a synonym for sublime? Transcendent. Divine."" 😫➸ “I want to know everything about you, Iris. I want to know your hopes and your dreams. I want to know what irritates you and what makes you smile and what makes you laugh and what you long for most in this world.”➸ ""A transcendent connection, a divine threshold. But if there\'s anything I should say in this moment - when my heart is beating wildly in my chest and I would beg you to come and tame it - is this: your letters have been a light for me to follow. Your words? A sublime feast that fed me on days when I was starving. I love you Iris” 😭😭➸ ""I pray that my days will be long by your side. Let me fill and satisfy every longing in your soul. May your hand be in mine, by sun and by night. Let our breaths twine and our blood become one, until our bones return to dust. Even then, may I find your soul still sworn to mine.""➸ “You and I … we need to stay together. We’re better this way.”__________________________________❥ Update 22/11/23: Can confirm this lives up to the hype 😭 Review to follow - I think it’s going to be a long one…❥ Update 19/11/23: Jumping on the bandwagon - pls pls live up the hype!'}]"

Though she works for the powerful and ruthless Assassin’s Guild, Celaena yields to no one and trusts only her fellow killer for hire, Sam.When Celaena's scheming master, Arobynn Hamel, dispatches her on missions that take her from remote islands to hostile deserts, she finds herself acting independently of his wishes—and questioning her own allegiance. Along the way, she makes friends and enemies alike, and discovers that she feels far more for Sam than just friendship. But by defying Arobynn’s orders, Celaena risks unimaginable punishment, and with Sam by her side, he is in danger, too. They will have to risk it all if they hope to escape Arobynn’s clutches—and if they fail, they’ll lose not just a chance at freedom, but their lives . . .A prequel to Throne of Glass, this collection of five novellas offers readers a deeper look into the history of this cunning assassin and her enthralling—and deadly—world.Included in this volume:The Assassin and the Pirate LordThe Assassin and the HealerThe Assassin and the DesertThe Assassin and the UnderworldThe Assassin and the Empire","[{'rating': 4, 'content': '""You said you didn\'t care what I thought.

I struggled through the first two novellas, and felt like Celaena was a completely different character than the one I had come to know.

Well, and then I met Gemma on goodreads and we decided to read the entire series as a buddy read. ;-)So far so good!Said and done!Still, before I re-read “Throne of Glass” I wanted to read“The Assassin’s Blade”because I already knew that the five novellas play before the book and ToG was full of references to Celaena’s time before Endovier! ;-)In short: It got me damn, freaking curious! XDI already knew I was in for a heartbreak!And my naïve me decided that she’d survive it! That it couldn’t be that bad, that it would be okay! I mean I already knew what would happen, so how could it hurt?See, that’s where I made my mistake!I was prepared and yet I still wasn’t able to anticipate how much this would actually hurt!I certainly wasn’t prepared forTHISkind of pain!!! And now I’m desperately trying to glue my heart together, thinking of Sam… gentle, sweet and caring Sam!! I can’t even…. T_TWell, I guess what my rather deranged mind is trying to tell you, is that I really loved this book!Every single story, every moment that formed Celaena into the person she’s become!!! I freaking love Celaena Sardothien and by now I feel like her pain is my own!!! <3333The plot:There are five novellas in this book an every single story is so carefully woven that you can’t help but have to get lost in it! I enjoyed them immensely and even though the first two stories weren’t all that exceptional they still contributed to the overall plot! ;-)I won’t go into detail until I reach my characters section, also known as “The Spoiler Zone”, but for those of you who are afraid to read the entire book because they know what’s going to happen and don’t want to be heartbroken here’s a little tip:You can read the first four novellas without regret! Sam’s still alive until the last story!!! Just thought I’d let you know! ;-PThe Assassin and the Pirate LordThe Assassin and the HealerThe Assassin and the DesertThe Assassin and the UnderworldThe Assassin and the EmpireThe characters:And here I go with the aforementioned “Spoiler Zone”! Beware and tread carefully!!! XD”I can wait,” he said thickly, kissing her collarbone. “We have all the time in the world.”Celaena:”She had made a powerful enemy of the Pirate Lord, and she was fairly certain she’d ruined her relationship with Arobynn, but she had been right. It was worth it; it would always be worth it, she told herself.”Oh my god!! I can’t even say how much I loved Celaena in this book! At first I thought her to be arrogant and spoiled, but the longer I read the more I began to see the real Celaena! XD Deep down within her she’s actually a very gentle and kind soul and no matter the consequences, she always opted to defend the weak! =)) Hell! She even freed 200 slaves that otherwise would have been doomed to a life in shackles and even though she always tried to live up to her reputation as Arobynn’s favourite assassin, she still knew the difference between right or wrong! I loved that she cried when she listened to the music in the theatre and I adored her for sparing Ansel’s life! This girl is amazing and it hurt so much to see her pain!! To experience what she felt when Sam died… At the end of the book she’s broken and nothing but an empty shell… and OH GOD did it hurt!!! T_T It hurt so much I can’t even put it into words… I want her to be happy again! I want her to laugh and to joke! I want her to tease Sam… I want her to feel alive again!!!!! T_T”I suppose it depends on who is telling the story.” Ansel chuckled.“If Arobynn Hamel is telling the story, then yes, I suppose I did deserve it. I cost him a good deal of money – a kingdom’s worth of riches, probably. I was disobedient and disrespectful, and completely remorseless about what I did.”She didn’t break her stare, and Mikhail’s smile faltered.“But if the two hundred slaves that I freed are telling the story, then no, I suppose I didn’t deserve it.”For me this was probably one of the most powerful scenes in the entire book and gosh I still get goose bumps whenever I read it! XDSam:”Sam smiled, his brown eyes turning golden in the dawn. It was such a Sam look, the twinkle of mischief, the hint of exasperation, the kindness that would always, always make him a better person than she was.”This boy was such a precious cinnamon roll!!! I mean seriously!! Could he have been any cuter? Nope! I don’t think so!!! I loved how he cared about Celaena! That he loved her for years and never told her! That he wanted to protect her at all costs and that he despised Arobynn for what he did to her! But oh Sam!! My poor and precious Sam!!! He didn’t deserve to go like that!!! He didn’t deserve to be tortured just because Arobynn was jealous!!! And the way they tortured him… what he had to endure in those last hours of his life… Oh god!! I can’t even!! T_T It broke my heart… When Celaena found him and saw what Farrand had done to him… Gosh! I get sick thinking about it… Sam... it hurts… it hurts so much!!! T_T”My price was his oath that he’d never lay a hand on you again. I told him I’d forgive him in exchange for that.””I love you,” he breathed against her mouth. “And from today onward, I want to never be separated from you. Wherever you go, I go. Even if that means going to Hell itself, wherever you are, that’s where I want to be. Forever.”Arobynn:”Father, brother, lover – he’d never really declared himself any of them. Certainly not the lover part, though if Celaena had been another sort of girl, and if Arobynn had raised her differently, perhaps it might have come to that.”I WANT HIM TO ROT IN HELL!!!!Please someone tell me that he’s going to die for what he did to Celaena and Sam!!! Please someone tell me that he’s going to suffer in one of the next books, because I can’t live on if I know that he’ll never get his punishment!!!I HATE HIM WITH A FIERCE PASSION AND I WON’T REST UNTIL HE’S SIX FEET UNDER!!! ARGH!Just to think about him makes me so angry!! Who is he to do things like that?! To betray them the way he did?! To kill Sam just because he loved Celaena!? I hate you Arobynn!!! I despise you with all my heart!After another moment of quiet, he asked, “Why did you do it?”Arobynn’s attention drifted back to the wagon, already a small dot in the rolling foothills above Rifthold. “Because I don’t like sharing my belongings.”Ansel:”Where do men find it in themselves to do such monstrous things? How do they find it acceptable?”I’m still torn when it comes to Ansel. I understand why she betrayed the Silent Master but I can’t forgive her for what she did. I really thought she’d become Celaena’s best friend, but then everything changed and I don’t know how I’m supposed to feel about her now. I really liked her, but the way she chose to deal with her problems was more than just wrong and I can’t help but wonder if she’ll make an appearance in the other books. If yes, I really hope that she managed to overcome her problems and was able to make peace with herself…”He’s an amazing warrior; he’s taught me far more than I would have learned without him. So they can tease me all they want, but at the end of the day, he’s still the one giving me extra attention when we train.Overall conclusion:I loved“The Assassin’s Blade”and even though my heart still hurts I don’t feel sorry for reading it. I’ll eventually survive the pain, but those five short stories will stay with me forever! I will remember them when I read the other books and the optimist in me still believes that one day the fond memories of Sam Cortland will be able to bring a smile to my face. =)'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Can we talk about how bad of an assassin Celaena is?”I’m Celaena Sardothien damn you all”“Does he know he’s talking to me?

And then I came across this compilation of the five prequel novellas. Normally, I don\'t like to read those #0.1 versions of a series, at least before reading the first book. However, as these novellas had been released prior to the first book, I hoped The Assassin\'s Blade would give me some indication, whether or not this is a series for me. I\'m happy I\'ve done so. This gives a clear understanding on the new world, characters, and underlying stories upon which the series would hopefully build upon.I really like the vivid, complex, and mysterious world Maas is creating here. Though the novellas only visit a handful of locations, I\'m looking forward to visit all the places as the series progresses. The plot-line, which is being established as a single continuous thread in these five novellas, is plenty intriguing to make anyone curious about next books. Right now, it\'s a little too overwhelming to imagine in which particular areas, or in which particular sequence, the events would take place, but I\'m hoping it\'ll be an exciting journey.I just have one misgiving: the main character, Celaena Sardothien.""She was fire, she was darkness, she was dust and blood and shadow.""And I felt like she was a little inconsistent. She is extraordinarily beautiful, insanely lethal, have impeccable taste in fashion, music and books, and then always impulsive. Some of those traits kind of conflicted each other, making the character appear a little too unrealistic. I mean, she would\'ve been fine for a children\'s\' book, but not here. Again, I\'m hoping this will abate in time.But overall, I loved this thorough beginning, covering all the things needed to get the reader started from the first page in next book, which, I\'m going to dive in to immediately.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'This review will be a little different from my others for several reasons.

I won’t me writing a super detailed review for each one, just a small summary, my favorite quote, and the rating.The Assassin\'s Bladeis a bind up of five novellas for theThrone of Glass Series. I’m just going to say this right way...I wish I would have read this right afterThrone of Glass. I wish I wouldn\'t have waited till I was four books in to pick this up. This book would have changed the way I viewed this series, and I mean that in the best way.These stories\xa0changed the way I see Celaena ,answered both little and big questions I had, and ultimately decided whose ""team"" I\'m on... but I\'ll get to that part in a few. These stories cover everything from young Celaena up until the point she ends up\xa0atEndovier (a salt mine prison).The Assassin and the Pirate Lord-10/10Celaena is sent with Sam to meet up with a Pirate Lord (obviously) to set up a deal for her boss. This is the first time we really get too see her and Sam actually interact. If you’ve read any of the other books, even just the first, then you know how sassy Celaena is and we get a look into why she is this way. Especially towards Sam. We get to see how she got her start, and how their relationship actually started. I know we’ve heard bits a pieces in the other books, but these start filling in all the cracks. After a twist in the plan is presented the two they have to deceive what path they want to take, and pick whose side they are going to be on.Favorite Quote:“You want my advice?” he asked her. “No.” “I’d watch my back around Sam. You might be the best, Sardothien, but there’s always someone waiting for you to slip.” Sam, the traitorous bastard, didn’t hide his smirk. The other pirate captains chuckled. Celaena stared hard at Rolfe… “You want my advice?” He waved a hand, beckoning her to go on. “Mind your own business.”TheAssassin and the Healer- 9/10After returning home from her mission with the Pirate Lord she is sent to the Red Deseret. This is where she will spend her summer as punishment. Before arriving to the Red Desert she is stuck in a small town waiting for her boat to arrive the next day. She finds herself helping a barmaid and teaching her how to defend herself. This was my least favorite story in the book. I also believe it is the shortest one. I didn’t hate it; it just didn’t have the same effect on me the other ones did. I didn’t feel like it gave me as much. I did like that it had a lot of the bitter angry Celaena that I love so much.Favorite Quote:“Let me give you a bitof advice, from one working girl to another: Life isn’t easy, no matter whereyou are. You’ll make choices you think are right, and then suffer for them.”TheAssassin and the Desert- 10/10Celaena finally arrives at the Red Desert to spend the summer training withthe Mute Master as punishment. While she is there she has to go through aKill Billstyle training to redeem a letter from the master before she can return back to the Guild. While there we learn how she got to be as good as she is, how she is starting to feel for Sam, and we get to hear about the “first real” friend she’s ever made. This is thestory that I feel lays down the foundation for why Celaena became the softer version of herself that we have all grown to love so much. Think this is where she goes from villain to something more. Some might disagree or think it happened at some other point, and some might think it hasn’t happened at all.Favorite Quote:“Go to Hell” Anselchuckled “I’ve been to Hell.”The Assassin and the Underworld-10/10Celaena is back from the desert and ready distract herself from owning up to her feeling. Not just the feelings she has for Sam but towards everything. She decides throwing herself fully into a mission is the best way to do this.The Underworldwas the biggest surprise read to me. Out of all five this one was my favorite. Everything finallyclicks, things really starts happening, and everything we’ve been waiting for is slammed into us. This story will always have a special place in my heart, and in this series. The best part is we get so much Sam and Celaenatime. I thought that the last story was going to be the one that choked me up, but this is the novella that got me.I was sneak reading at work and had to cry on the inside like a winner. So manyfeels.Favorite Quote:“and from today onward,I want to never be separated from you. Where you go, I go. Even if that meansgoing to Hell itself, where you are, that’s where I want to be. Forever.”TheAssassin and the Empire- 10/10If you’ve read even just the first few chapters ofThrone of Glass,then you already know what is going to happen in this story… I would like to say that you’ll be ready for it… but I won’t lie. You won’t be. This story has everything in it. The emotions, the fighting, the betrayal, the answers about what really happened to Sam that terrible evening,and how Celaena ultimately got caught. This story will break you. Second favorite in this bind up.Favorite Quotes:“Deep down, she said,“I’m a coward.” His brows rose. “I’m a coward,” she repeats “And I’m scared. I’mscared all the time. Always.”“I am Celaena Sardothien… and I willnot be afraid.”This book had me laughing, crying, swearing, praying, and completed me. I thought it would help with the pain of waiting for book five, but all it did was make me crave it even more. I loveCelaena, she is my favorite literary female. She falls in this area of being a villainand being a hero. She is everything I want from my leading lady. She is fireand smoke. She is hard and soft. Loving, strong, and weak. She is changing the game...I thank Sarah J every day for this series. I finally want to end this long review with these two statements: (this isn’t a spoiler it’s just my theory) I in no way shape or form believeSam is dead. I might be in denial but I just don’t. I think the biggest twist in this series will be that he is still alive. Also for the question I left hanging at the beginning of this; whose team am I on… Thought it was Rowan, but then again something always felt like it was missing. That’s because Sam is what was missing. I am officially and 100% on Team Sam. If he really really isn’taround, then I want Celaena to stand on her own. This series is phenomenal.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""“The only secret I’ve borne my entire life is that I love you.”Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam…Forever pain, forever depression. This will forever hurt.———————————————I don't know how this book continues to destroy me with every reread. This will always be one of the most heart-wrenching stories for me. The way Sarah J Maas fleshed out the characters in this book and their emotions pulled at my insides. It hurt like nothing else. I hate it. And I'm incredibly in love with this collection of novellas.Original review!“She would tuck Sam into her heart, a bright light for her to take out whenever things were darkest.”Reread. 5 stars, of course.This is the kind of book that once you're finished reading, you'll need all the chocolates and ice cream to stuff yourself with and all the comedy movies to watch, because the gaping hole and emotional heaviness it leaves you with is slightly torturous.This book is a bind-up of 5 novellas which explore events that took place before Throne of Glass. Rereading it now, I think that it's probably best to start off with this book, then continue on with the rest of the series, because you'll gain a better appreciation for our main character.Celaena is such a great female protagonist. Utter boss! This book sheds a lot more light into her history and how she became the person she is. There's so much more emotion and vulnerability to her in this book that we don't get to see that often. But she's also an assassin. Hardcore and cruel and the fact that she encompasses both ends of the spectrum is so great to see. I love how that human element has been added, that not everything you know about a person and how they react to certain situations is always going to be black and white. Your past has a lot to do with it. Your circumstances which will have shaped you. The people you surround yourself with and I adore Sarah J Maas for incorporating that into a story about assassins.And Sam, Sam, for fucks same, Sam. I'm in mourning. I keep wishing Celaena was able to declare her love for him. Something verbal that at least he could've taken with him. I don't know why it destroys my heart, because I'm pretty sure Celaena regrets this in the other books but every time I think about it I want to die, tbh.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'I really enjoyed this! Some stories I liked more than others, but it was nice to see what happened to Celaena leading up to Throne of Glass.I would have liked to have seen more of her when she was younger and training, though.Now, on to rereading Throne of Glass!'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""—— 3.5 ✰ stars.・❥・ Mood of the book: Triumph by Bishop BriggsThe reading order of this saga is one of the most discussed topics in the reading community. To begin with, you should know that you can read this book in first, third or fourth place. The first time I read it, I read it between the third and fourth book, which I don't recommend since it means going back to the past and it made mecompletely disconnect from the story and not continue with the series,which is why I'm rereading it right now. Therefore, everyone can read it as they want, but, in very humble opinion,I would start with this one if it is the first time you read the series, since you are going to connect in a different way with the events of the book.Since this book is made up of five short stories, I will review each of them separately as I read them.My final score will consist of the average score of the five stories.I warn in advance that I am not the biggest fan of short stories, they tend to seem somewhat tedious and boring to me.˗ˏˋ ★ ˎˊ˗ 𝕿һᥱ 𝕬ssᥲssіᥒ ᥲᥒძ 𝗍һᥱ 𝕻іrᥲ𝗍ᥱ 𝕷᥆rძ ˗ˏˋ ★ ˎˊ˗‘If you ever tell anyone about me embracing you… I’ll gut you’Rating: 3.✰ stars.In this story, Celaena, along with her partner, Sam, goes to close a deal on behalf of the master assassin, with Rolfe, master pirate, but they will be in for a surprise when they discover the content of said deal.The pace of the story is good, and it keeps you entertained until the end, it is full of action and conspiracy.

There is mystery, action and quite a few feelings and much more high stakes. A clear evolution and character development is seen in Celaena. Of the first three, the best story.˗ˏˋ ★ ˎˊ˗ 𝕿һᥱ 𝕬ssᥲssіᥒ ᥲᥒძ 𝗍һᥱ 𝖀ᥒძᥱrᥕ᥆rᥣძ ˗ˏˋ ★ ˎˊ˗‘And from today onward, I want to never be separated from you. Whenever you go, I go.

It has twists and surprises and the romance that has been building during the three previous stories is finally starting to happen.˗ˏˋ ★ ˎˊ˗ 𝕿һᥱ 𝕬ssᥲssіᥒ ᥲᥒძ 𝗍һᥱ 𝕰m⍴іrᥱ ˗ˏˋ ★ ˎˊ˗‘‘My name is Celaena Sardothien, and I will not be afraid’’Rating: 5.✰ stars.I can't say absolutely anything about what this story is about without spoiling everything that happened in the book, just to say that Sarah J Maas is a master of cliff hangers and endings. My heart is forever broken, despite knowing what was going to happen I still cried a lot.Once again I recommend starting the series with this book, so that the experience is full, surprising and you can connect 100% with the events of the book.➤Throne of Glass Series:╰┈➤Throne of Glass, 3.75✰ stars.╰┈➤Crown of Midnight, 4✰ stars.╰┈➤Heir of Fire, 3.5✰ stars.╰┈➤Queen of Shadows, 4✰ stars.╰┈➤Empire of Storms, 3.5✰ stars.╰┈➤Tower of Dawn, 4.5✰ stars.￫ old updates:jan 06:my mom choose this book for me 🫡 let’s start our throne of glass re read bitches 😈💅🏻""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '《 4.5 ✰ 》❝“Where do men find it in themselves to do such monstrous things? How do they find it acceptable?”The Assassin’s Bladewas a great introduction to the series. I was immediately invested in the story. I do love a flawed and fierce fmc.

Estos relatos sobre la vida de Celaena previa a conocerla en el primer tomo de la saga,Trono de Cristal,nos hacen conocer un poquito más de su pasado, así como personajes que tienen apariciones en los libros de este universo.Así que sí, esnecesarioleerlo.Sin duda alguna, para míCelaena es una de mis protagonistas favoritasEVER.No puedo describir con palabras lo que me gusta, lo que me hace sentir... Creo que no es solo definida, sino queconstantemente se batalla en sombras, traumas y decisiones arriesgadas. Asume las consecuencias de sus actos, pero también es rebelde.Eso sí, para todo siempre tiene un plan y casi siempre sale airosa de las situaciones peliagudas. No sé, me encanta. ¡Y más sabiendo que esto es una precuela! Ha sido genial conocer un poco más cómo funciona su cabeza, y sobre todo, porque aquí es un poquito menos fría en algunos temas que en el resto de libros.Mi relato favorito ha sido sin duda alguna el deLa asesina y el desierto, seguido muy de cerca deLa asesina y la curandera.Me parecen no solo más interesantes por sus localizaciones y misiones, sino porque siento que también muestran algo muy importante en el universo deTrono de Cristal. Personajes como Ansel me han fascinado, y espero que tengamos un poquito más de ella en siguientes libros.¡No puede terminar de esa manera!Los relatosLa asesina y el Señor de los Piratas,La asesina y el inframundoyLa asesina y el imperiono me parecieron tan espectaculares, aunquelos disfruté igual.Creo que cada uno de ellos juega una parte importante en la trama, tanto interna como externa, así que son indispensables en todos los aspectos.Lo que me enfada es no haber sabido antes nada sobre Bahía de la Calavera.¡Si esa historia es una bomba! Me encantó.[image error]Otra de las cosas que más me ha gustado es conocer más a fondo el continente. Ya no solo las ciudades que Celaena visita, las diferencias que estas tienen con Rithfold, sino también ahondar en el Gremio de los Asesinos, en el desierto, en la costa y los piratas, o por ejemplo,lo que más me ha flipado: Los Asesinos Silenciosos. De eso sí que necesito más, por favor.Una maravilla.No podemos obviar que en todo esto, la causante que unas historias tan aparentemente sencillas sean tan espectaculares, es la Maas.Es de las pocas autoras que disfruto por el simple hecho de leerlas. No me pierdo ni una coma, ni una tilde, ni un punto.Todo me encanta, y lo que digo: disfruto muchísimo del concepto de leer con su estilo. Puede parecer una tontería, peroautoras como Sarah J. Maas me hacen recordar todo lo bueno y bonito que tiene la lectura.Respecto a las tramas que se tocan he de admitir quecreo haber leído esta entrega un poco tarde(aunque bueno, es cuando se ha publicado en español). Considero quees mejor leerLa espada de la asesinadespués del primer o segundo volumen de la saga.Por mi parte, hay personajes que apenas ya recordaba y he tenido que hacer un esfuerzo para recordar esas tramas. No ha importado, sin embargo, para que disfrute el libro como un enano.Esta precuela es más que una serie de relatos: es sumirnos en la mente de Celaena, su vida antes de ser una esclava en Endovier, conocer a Sam y más sobre los asesinos de Rithfold.Hay detalles muy importantes en este libro, pero sobre todo, lo vas a disfrutar.Si te gusta la saga,es un imprescindible.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""i amveryhappy with my decision to start my throne of glass journey with the assassin's blade! this was a fast-paced prequel, especially since it was broken down into 5 novellas. my favorites werethe assassin and the pirate lord, the assassin and the desertandthe assassin and the underworld. i really enjoyed the insight it gave me on celaena, arobynn, sam and all of the other characters who i'm sure will pop up throughout the rest of the series.that ending had my eyes watering 🥲💔 now, on to throne of glass!

I am just staring at the screen, completely blank and void of emotion as I type this out. I did cry, obviously and as I expected, but I don\'t think I\'ve come to accept that I\'ve finally actually finished this whole entire series.I\'m also in denial about a certain thing that happens in this.I may as well get into this review to distract myself from the numbness and denial.The plotI have known all along that I should\'ve read this before reading Throne of Glass, but alas, it\'s fine. I picked up on a lot of foreshadowing for the rest of the series and I felt so smug and proud of myself whenever I saw those clues.So, there were 5 novellas in this book and I think the reason it took longer than expected for me to read this was because the first novella was pretty boring. Nothing really happened in it. But I\'ll put in separate descriptions of each novella below.The Assassin and the Pirate Lord: ★★★-This one was pretty slow and not much really happened, except near the end, but it just felt so tame compared to the other novellas. We got introduced to Sam, Rolfe, and Celaena. We got to see their characters, and while I already knew Celaena and Rolfe, I hadn\'t read about Sam yet. But I\'ll talk about the characters later. Overall, this was my least favorite novella.The Assassin and the Healer: ★★★.5-I loved seeing Yrene again in this one. When her name popped up, I gasped and shouted ""Yrene!"" It was wonderful seeing a member of the main Throne of Glass crew, even though it made me a little sad. This one didn\'t have much going on in it either, the only reason it\'s better than the first novella is because Yrene was in it and Yrene is amazing.The Assassin and the Desert: ★★★★.5-This one was much better than the previous two. There were plot twists that literally made me gasp, and it was fast paced. I liked seeing more of Ansel\'s character as well. I\'d felt meh about her in EoS and the beginning of KoA, I didn\'t really care for her. But in this one, I really liked her. But then she did some things and I began to dislike her. Now I don\'t know how to feel, but I think she was better in KoA. It pains me that I don\'t remember.The Assassin and the Underworld: ★★★★★-Arobynn is an absolute disgusting pig. Trying to get her to forgive him for BEATING HER? Nuh uh. This novella was so gooood. My second favorite. We were introduced to Lysandra (I LOVE HER. Not in this one, but in the rest of the series) and Celaena was in denial over her feelings towards Sam. There was action and twists and I loved it. Sorry, I\'m still feeling numb and my brain can\'t remember what happened because all I can think about is the next novella:The Assassin and the Empire: ★★★★★-PAIN PAIN PAIN. I\'d gone in knowing what would happen but I still am in P A I N. This was definitely my favorite, no matter how much I HATE what happened. Was Sam stupid in this one? Yes. Should he have let Celaena go with him to go take on Farran? YES. NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF HE HAD JUST LET HER GO WITH HIM. Or maybe it would have. BUT WHATEVER. The ending of the novella was just a punch to the gut and I will never recover.All I can think about is this: If none of this had happened then we would have never gotten what happened in the other books. That doesn\'t really help much, but it\'s something.“If you can learn to endure pain, you can survive anything. Some people learn to embrace it- to love it. Some endure it through drowning it in sorrow, or by making themselves forget. Others turn it into anger.”The charactersWell, I guess I have to say goodbye to these characters all over again WHAT FUN.Celaena Sardothien“My name is Celaena Sardothien,” she whispered, “and I will not be afraid.”Celaena was interesting in this book. I love her throughout the series, but I was annoyed by her in this book. While Celaena did periodically annoy me throughout the series, she always grew from her mistakes and she is such a strong character.I feel so badly for what happened in this book. She just wanted to have a future where it was just her and Sam, where they were happy and in love.Sam Cortland“I can wait,” he said thickly, kissing her collarbone. “We have all the time in the world.”....it was lines like these that made me cry because of what I knew.I had gone into this terrified I wouldn\'t like him since I am in love with Rowan, but oh my gosh SAMMMMM 😭😭 HE IS THE ABSOLUTE SWEETEST. HE GOT HER SHEET MUSIC TO HER FAVORITE SONG. HE ASKED THAT AROBYNN NEVER HURT HER AGAIN FOR HIS FORGIVENESS.PAIN PAIN PAIN. That is the only word that can comprehend my feelings. 😭Yrene Towers“This girl wasn’t like wildfire—she was wildfire. Deadly and uncontrollable. And slightly out of her wits.”I love Yrene so much. I understand a lot about her background now, and a lot of stuff she talked about in Tower of Dawn, and I loved her in this. Not much to say since I already loved her before I read this.LysandraOk look. I love Lysandra. But in this one I DESPISED her. She was so annoying to Celaena, and the way she kept flirting with Sam irked me. I do feel bad for her over what Arobynn\'s doing with her *gag* and I understand a lot of why Celaena hated Lysandra in Queen of Shadows.“She was fire, she was darkness, she was dust and blood and shadow.”The relationship“I love you,” he repeated, shaking her again. “I have for years. But if I asked you to pick, you’d choose Arobynn, and I. Can’t. Take. It.”“You’re a damned idiot,” she breathed, grabbing the front of his tunic. “You’re a moron and an ass and a damned idiot.” He looked like she had hit him. But she went on, and grasped both sides of his face. “Because I’d pick you.”I HATE EVERYTHING. I HATE IT. I feel painnnnnnnn.I literally started crying when I read this line:“I hate to admit it, Sam Cortland, but I missed your sorry ass, too.”And this one:“And from today onward, I want to never be separated from you. Wherever you go, I go. Even if that means going to Hell itself, wherever you are, that\'s where I want to be. Forever.”It\'s not fair. They just wanted their happily ever after. BUT NOTHING IS THAT EASY IN A HIGH FANTASY BOOK, NOW IS IT.Please pardon my little breakdown, I\'m feeling crazy right now.But I remind myself. Nothing in Throne of Glass would\'ve happened if the events in this book had not taken place.BUT THAT DOESN\'T HELP MY FEELINGS.“Life isn\'t easy, no matter where you are. You\'ll make choices you think are right, and then suffer for them.”Anywho, I\'m very sad that I\'m done with this series and now I want to go curl into a ball and never leave my room ever again.4.5 stars“She would tuck Sam into her heart, a bright light for her to take out whenever things were darkest.”I will say it one last time: P A I N<><><><><><><><>I feel numb.I\'d give anything to read this whole series for the first time againrtc'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""1.)Throne of Glass★★2.)Crown of Midnight★★★★[2024 reread]★★★this is an anthology, short story collection, of five tales set prior to the events inthrone of glass. they are told in chronological order, with each one building off the previous one, and ultimately showing us how celaena ended up in the salt mines when we meet her for the very first time. we also get introduced to a lot of characters who we will meet in this universe, with some backstory on how celaena met them for the very first time.ultimately, i did enjoy this, and i truly just enjoy the project of this - i wish more authors would give me short stories set in worlds, with characters, that i already am established with and love. yet, i don't think they add too much to thethrone of glassworld. sometimes it felt like they were really just showcasing how celaena is a good person and sjm really, really just wants the reader to know that, but i still had a fun time reading these. i do think they add to the overall series, and i do recommend you read these, but the enjoyment is for sure going to vary from reader to reader - more than most reading experiences, i feel.down below i break down each short story in this anthology, give them individual star ratings, and list their trigger and content warnings! (my favorite beingthe assassin and the healer, because i am a yrene fangirl, and my least favorite probably beingthe assassin and the underworld, because celaena was just being too annoying in it for me lol.)━━♡ 0.1)The Assassin and the Pirate Lord★★★this first short story starts off in an assassin’s guild, two years before the events of tog, and where an emergency meeting is being held by the king of assassins himself, arobynn. someone is murdering assassins, and celaena and sam are tasked with a mission to go to skulls bay, have a meeting with the pirate lord, and give him a sealed letter from arobynn himself. yet, when they get to skulls bay, they realize there is a much more heartbreaking situation going on, and sam and celaena decide to do something about it all on their own, regardless of the costs.i really liked seeing sam and celaena start to get to know each other, and start to figure out the people they want to be together, too. i also loved seeing the skulls bay setting, and why the location is the way it is currently in the book series, because of the actions in this novella. i wont lie, this read a little too white savior in 2024, but i still enjoyed reading this opener in this anthology collection, and it setting the tone for what is to come.tw/cw: death, loss of a friend, grief, slavery, human trafficking (with an emphasis on children, as well), captivity, fighting/battle, explosions, violence, blood━━♡ 0.2)The Assassin and the Healer★★★★please know i am truly screaming at my 2016 review for this short story because i was fully like “this is filler, who is this girl?” lol. oh sweet summer, me shipping celaena and chaol, so hard i didn’t see the dots were dotting right before my eyes, child.this short story takes place obviously after the first, but we get to see how arobynn punished celaena for her actions in skulls bay, and continuing to punish her by sending her to train in the red desert. but while she is waiting for her boat, she is staying at an inn where she helps a worker. And that worker? ends up playing a very big role in the rest of the series. yrene towers is a healer, stuck in a small port town, while hiding her magic that is now outlawed. this story switches povs between the two women, and it was just really heartwarming. i really do love yrene, and just seeing her really want to master her gift that was passed down from all the women in her family at a healer academy, and just really want to heal and make the world a better place - it just gave me all the feels. i for sure appreciated this novella more in 2024.tw/cw: extreme physical abuse in past, abusive relationships / unhealthy power dynamics, loss of mother in past, insinuation / threat of sexual assault, assault - unwanted touching, blood, vomit━━♡ 0.3)The Assassin and the Desert★★★i truly am giving sarah a lot of credit for plotting and planning her overarching universe way back in the day, back before she sold millions of books and became the phenomenon in the book community that she is today. this novella had so many easter eggs in it, that i felt like i was taking notes for a full length sjm book.this one picks up right after the second story in this anthology, where we are following celaena going through the desert to find the oasis where assassins are training. this is her punishment for the events in the 1st story in this anthology, where she is supposed to train with a very powerful assassin who makes you prove yourself before he will offer to train you, and then she is supposed to bring back a letter with his approval. it has taken her one month of travel to get to this desert, she is required to train for one month, and then travel back to arobynn and the assassin’s guild in rifthold - therefore she is going to be away for three months, which also held her birthday!while at this training facility, and while trying to catch the eye of the assassin trainer she wants, she befriends a girl named ansel. in this story, they get very close and realize they have a lot of the same sadness held within their hearts. celaena also learns a lot about witches, and spidersilk, and she even makes a promise that will lead her on another mission that she will attempt to fulfill one day.again, i loved seeing so many nods at things to come in the story - but for some reason this felt so long to read, and i found myself bored a lot of the time. maybe it is because I remembered the twist, so it was less impactful. But yeah, the reread of this one felt very middle of the road for me.tw/cw: mention of slavery, physical abuse in past, abusive relationships / unhealthy power dynamics, mention of uncomfortable age gap romance where the mc is underage (15), fighting/battle, violence, torture, blood, poison, fire, talk of debt, brief mention of child death, spiders, snakes, talk of colonization, loss of father and sibling in past━━♡ 0.4)The Assassin and the Underworld★★★i mean this in the nicest way possible, but celaena is so annoying in this short story. she is finally back in rifthold, after being gone training for three months, and arobynn apologies and sends her on a mission to make up for the abuse that came after the first story in this anthology. celaena starts following the clues about the slave trade and safe houses during her mission and (painfully slowly) starts to figure out maybe not all is what it seems.we also get introduced to lyssandra in this story, and it really did make my heart hurt to read. this story really emphasizes how arobynn is a gross predatory man, who is grooming and abusing these young adults in many different ways. celaena and sam actually do become a thing in this installment, after a lot of push and pull, but it did taste rather bittersweet because the reader knows what is to come. but the spidersilk really was a sweet twist and made me smile.tw/cw: extreme physical abuse in past, abusive relationships / unhealthy power dynamics, grooming (and its very uncomfortable to read), predatory men, gaslighting, manipulation, slavery, battle/violence, blood, vomit, mention of loss of mother in past, sex work shaming, drowning, suicide/sacrificing one’s life━━♡ 0.5)The Assassin and the Empire★★★this last story opens up with celaena shacked in the back of a wagon, leading her to where we first meet her inthrone of glass. but then, the story goes back eleven days to how she got in this wagon, after things felt so happy at the end of the fourth short story.celaena and sam are living together, but sam feels like they need more money so he is doing paid fights. jobs are a little bit more hard to come by, because arobynn has essentially blacklisted them in the assassins market. so sam feels like the only thing that he and celaena can do, is leave rifthold for good, but before they sail away on that ship they need to do one last big job each. yet, we as the reader know this is not going to end well because this story opens up with celaena in captivity of the king’s men.this one was obviously sad, but i feel like celaena just couldn’t connect a dot, even when the dots were right in front of her practically connecting themselves. but there's a lot of betrayal and a lot events that make celaena who she is when we meet her inthrone of glass. Yet, i just didn’t love this one and i even closed this book during this reread just really not liking sam, which i really think is not intended lol.tw/cw: extreme physical abuse in past, abusive relationships / unhealthy power dynamics, grooming (and its very uncomfortable to read), predatory men, gaslighting, manipulation, slavery, battle/violence, blood, torture, missing loved one, loss of a loved one / partner, grief, depressing, drugging, sexual assault threat insinuations[2016 first read]★★★♡old review on my blogblog|instagram|youtube|kofi|spotify|amazon1.)A Court of Thorns and Roses★★★★2.)A Court of Mist and Fury★★★3.)A Court of Wings and Ruin★★★3.1)A Court of Frost and Starlight★★★4)A \u200bCourt of Silver Flames★★★★1.)House of Earth and Blood★★★2.)House of Sky and Breath★★★3.)House of Flame and Shadow★★★""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I can't believe I have had this book forever and just now read it.

Maas worked her magic and I ended up loving it! It really adds to the series as a whole 🤩🤩“This girl wasn’t like wildfire—she was wildfire. Deadly and uncontrollable. And slightly out of her wits.”The Assassin\'s Blade is a collection of novellas giving us a glimpse into Celeana\'s past before the events of Throne of Glass. It\'s a prequel of sorts and elaborates on things hinted at in the books. Since there\'s so much to unpack, I\'m gonna go through the novellas one by one.“My name is Celaena Sardothien,"" she whispered, ""and I will not be afraid.”♤ The Assassin and the Pirate Lord:In this novella, Celeana and Sam head to Skull\'s Bay together to broker a deal between their master Arobynn Hamel, and the Rolfe, the leader of the pirates. It seems like this should be a really great novella- pirates, plenty of action, plus some scheming on Celeana\'s part. Yet I found I didn\'t really love this one for some reason. I know a lot of people will disagree with me, but it just didn\'t quite grab my attention 😕Though I must admit that the way Celeana and Sam\'s relationship developed in that novella alone was SUPERB 😍😍 They went from hating each other at the beginning to reluctantly working together to something ELSE- *dreamy sigh* I know they only got together MUCH later, but this was also just a great introduction to seeing them together 🤌🤌Overall, it was entertaining enough but didn\'t have much depth. Not my favorite of the novellas tbh 😬😬~ The Assassin and the Healer:In this novella, Celeana was staying in the tavern where she met Yrene Towers, a lowly barmaid there. They develop a connection when Yrene is threatened. Once again, unpopular opinion, but... I didn\'t particularly like this one. It was fun enough and obviously well-written, but I feel like not much happened. And the climax felt rushed. That\'s honestly just me. I know a lot of other people will love this novella, but I sadly wasn\'t one of them 😔😔~ The Assassin and the Desert:As punishment for what happened in Skull\'s Bay, Arobynn Hamel sent Celeana to the Red Desert, where she would train with the Silent Assassins and have to get the Master\'s letter of approval to return. There, she meets other assassins, faces new challenges and has to battle a mysterious threat.I actually really enjoyed this novella! It had lots of things that made it really fun to read: an exotic setting, loads of new characters, action AND a great twist. 😏😏 It was really fun to read and that climax was SO GOOD. It definitely helped me regain interest after not loving the first 2 novellas 🥰🥰~ The Assassin and the Underworld:This one takes place back in Rifthold, after Celeana has returned from the Red Desert. Arobynn has given her another job: an assassination. As she works on the job, tensions between her and Sam develop further and that\'s when the romance REALLY starts 😏😏I also really liked this one. It was really action-packed and again had a really surprising twist. However, even tho that was all cool, the best part was the new tension between Celeana & Sam. This was when the romance really began and lemme tell you, it was AMAZING. Seriously their chemistry is off the charts!! If I had to choose between him and Rowan, I\'d honestly have no idea. I LOVE YOU SAM 🥰🥰😍😍❣❣~ The Assassin and the Empire:*hysterical sobbing**screaming*WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY 😭😭😭😭😭😭😵😵😵😵😖😖😖😖😭😭😭😭☹☹😱😱😫😫😫😣😣I knew it was coming for the entire book and yet when it actually happened.... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!! I would\'ve started full-on ugly crying if I hadn\'t been in a public space. IT WAS JUST TOO CRUELThat is all I have to say about that novella“She would tuck Sam into her heart, a bright light for her to take out whenever things were darkest.”Overall, I really enjoyed the Assassin\'s Blade! I struggled to get into it at first as the first 2 novellas didn\'t really grab my attention, but the last 3 were really great. Tho #5 FREAKING BROKE MY HEART. But anywayyy....

I\'ll include links at the bottom of the post to the individual reviews on Goodreads, for those of you who are afraid of being inadvertently spoiled.In the summer of \'12, I was desperately seeking new reading material, and stumbled across the preview chapters of THRONE OF GLASS by Sarah J. Maas.I downloaded them, devoured them, and gashed my teeth in impatience when I discovered the full book wasn\'t due to be released for several more weeks.BUT.There were four prequel novellas thatwereavailable. So I one-clicked all of them and read them immediately.They only increased my hunger for THRONE OF GLASS.~The Assassin and the Pirate Lord~First, I think it\'s important to recognize that one of--if notthe--main purposes of these novellas is to grow Celaena from an intolerably insolent and arrogant adolescent into a world-wiser (but still cocky) young adult.The #1 complaint about this series is that readers don\'t like Celaena.Personally, I love her, but I understand why others might not. She\'s a superlative character, and some people can\'t handle her extremes, and that\'s only one of a dozen legitimate issues.BUT.There are several loudly voiced complaints that, as far as I\'m concerned, don\'t hold water. I\'ve already addressed my feelings in regards to the claim that she is too girly to make a believable assassin in myThrone of Glassreview.The other assertion I cannot abide is that Celaena ""never does anything,"" or ""never kills anyone.""That she\'s basically all talk.Maybe I\'m confused, but I\'ve never supposed that assassins are meant to go around killing EVERYONE indiscriminately. And she\'s notjustan assassin. She\'s the King of Assassins\' heir.Adarlan\'s Assassin.At least half of her identity is reputation, and it wouldn\'t behoove that reputation (or be good for business) to run around like a maniac slitting throats and eviserating passersby.In this novella, she\'s a sixteen-year-old girl who single-handedly disarms and disables the entire crew of apirateship. She easily defeats the Pirate Lord in combat, using his own weapons to do it.How is that nothing? How is that all talk? *mind is boggled*Beyond establishing herself as a seriously kick-ass heroine, the foundation for something that will shred your heart into teeny, tiny pieces is also laid. <------*WAILS*And, you know . . . there are pirates.Everything is better with pirates.SO. Not my favorite of the bunch, but a close(ish) second.~The Assassin and the Healer~This novella wasn\'t part of the original four. I chased down pieces of it on various blogs, over the course of several days before CROWN OF MIDNIGHT was released.Anyway, I liked this one a lot, too.So should anyone who thinks Celaena doesn\'t kill often enough. How about six or eight mercs in a dark alley after they try to rob and attack a barmaid?All I\'m saying is that\'s an awful lot of bodies piling up for an assassin who allegedly doesn\'t assassin.Moving on.We also learn some Celaena background: that her country was destroyed by war, and she feels a kinship with others who have suffered similar fates. That as a child she had dreams that are in complete contradiction to her current status.Aaaannddd we (once again) get to observe the softer side of Celaena. The side that compels her to intervene on behalf of others when she can--one of the many reasons I\'m able to overlook her more abrasive qualities.Bottom line: a worthy addition to the canon.~The Assassin and the Desert~Oh, my FEELS. They hurrrrrrt *sobs*So what does is say about me that this is my favorite of the group? Hmm . . .In the inevitable aftermath of her actions in Pirateville, Celaena is sent into the blistering, unforgiving heat of the desert to train with the Mute Master, Arobynn\'s (infinitely more benevolent) Southern counterpart.She has one month to train with the Silent Assasssins. One month to earn the Mute Master\'s respect in the form of a letter to Hamel on Celaena\'s behalf, commending her efforts and abilities.One. Month.This is the novella that makes me determinedly profess that readers\' NEED to read the prequels.There are people and places and events that have already begun to play a greater role in the main books, with half a dozen foreshadowings of things to come.You. NEED. To. Read. It.And it won\'t make sense, if you haven\'t read the first one, and after that . . . Well, why not just read them all?Besides . . . Don\'t youwantto see Celaena fumble her way through her first friendship? And not just her first friendship, but her first friendship with a GIRL?Of courseyou do.And who could blame you?~The Assassin and the Underworld~This novella should have been called THE ASSASSIN AND THE TANGLED WEB OF AROBYNN HAMEL, but I guess it doesn\'t rollllll off the tongue the same way.I really wish I could give you an accounting of the events that take place here unhindered by the knowledge of what\'s to come.But I can\'t.I read it too many times and it broke my heart too completely.THE ASSASSIN AND THE UNDERWORLD is about what happens when Celaena returns to the Assassin\'s Keep after Arobynn beat her into unconsciousness and sent her to the desert.Celaena arrives full of confidence and more than a little bit of self-satisfaction.She succeeded in accomplishing her nearly-impossible-to-complete task. More than succeeded. Was sent home from the Red Desert with a fortune great enough to purchase her freedom.When she struts into Arobynn\'s office, she has every intention of telling him, and leaving him.Unfortunately . . . It doesn\'t work out that way.Instead, she allows herself to fall back under his spell. Not fully, she\'s been made too wary for that, but enough that she becomes an unwilling accomplice in his nefarious plans one last time.This is where we first see the depth of Arobynn\'s treachery.My thoughts on Celaena\'s lack of immediate response to said treachery upon her return to Rifthold in ToG:Many think Celaena is being willfully obtuse about the role her mentor played in the events that led to Sam\'s horrific death and her imprisonment at Endovier, but this is something I understand:""Father, brother, lover—he’d never really declared himself any of them. Certainly not the lover part, though if Celaena had been another sort of girl, and if Arobynn had raised her differently, perhaps it might have come to that.He loved her like family, yet he put her in the most dangerous positions.He nurtured and educated her, yet he’d obliterated her innocence the first time he’d made her end a life.He’d given her everything, but he’d also taken everything away.She could no sooner sort out her feelings toward the King of the Assassins than she could count the stars in the sky.""And there\'s nothing she canDOabout it in the course of the first few books. She knows they\'ll see each other again, but as much as she desires vengeance and is determined to get it:""In the silence of her bedroom, she swore an oath to the moonlight that if Sam were hurt, no force in the world would hold her back from slaughtering everyone responsible.""She also dreads it.Celaena is a work in progress. She\'s headstrong and stubborn. Arrogant with poor impulse control. BUT. Sheisgrowing. Steadily. Consistently. Eventually she\'ll reach the point where she can take an unobscured look at Arobynn and acknowledge not only how he betrayed her to the king, but how he wasnoneof things to her she\'d struggled with reconciling: father, brother, lover.He was aplague.~The Assassin and the Realm~THE ASSASSIN AND THE REALM starts at the end. Celaena is suddenly a prisoner of we-don\'t-know-whom/we-don\'t-know-why.All we know is that she\'s shattered. She does not care that she\'s caged like an animal. She does not care that she\'s in chains. Cold, hunger, thirst, all things beyond her concern.And then . . . in the dark . . . she remembers.Maas is an expert at cultivating DREAD. It may not be as stealthy here, what with us already knowing that Celaena--in some context--has failed, but that doesn\'t negate the fear, the roil in your belly, as you push yourself to keep reading, to find out what happened, what went wrong, so that at least then . . . it will be over.As I said earlier, I read these before reading THRONE OF GLASS, so I can\'t state from experience that if you\'re having issues with Celaena, reading THE ASSASSIN\'S BLADE will fix them. BUT. I can say that I\'ve never had any issues with her character development, and the majority of readers who have taken my advice have found themselves understanding her better than they had previously. Beyond that, you need the background from Celaena\'s time in the Red Desert to fully appreciate what\'s happening in the main series (myfavoriteYA series, incidentally). <------FYI.SO. Read it. I\'m so far passed ""recommending"" it that I\'m brandishing it wildly.“My name is Celaena Sardothien,” she whispered, “and I will not be afraid.”My other reviews for this series:Throne of Glass (Throne of Glass, #1)Crown of Midnight (Throne of Glass #2)Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass #3)Queen of Shadows (Throne of Glass #4)Untitled (Throne of Glass, #5)'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""NO WORDS.Just sobbing, dying, laughing and dying again.Enjoy readers. :)This was a mix of billions of wonderful stories and I guarantee y'all, ur in for a sobbing-fest.So yes, you'll be needing......:-donuts (idk, just get SWEETS)-more SJM books.....-MORE BOOKS-you're mom's credit card to go buy those booksor you could rob a bank-a buddy to scream and cry to-6000000 tissue boxesYah.Alright alright.No, u ain't just gonna cry ur eyeballs out.NO.UR GONNA SMILE TILL UR MOUTH SPLITS TOO!!!!!!How fun is that?Just......everything was brilliant.Celaena was an amazing character.Some were obviously jerks.I was a potato who cried my little heart out:pAND NOOOOWWWWWWWWW.We shall end this review/sob-fest.Good bye, peeps. ;)""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '#0.1-#0.5The Assassin’s Blade★★★★★#1Throne of Glass★★★★★#2Crown of Midnight★★★★★#3Heir of Fire★★★★★#4Queen of Shadows★★★★★#5Empire of Storms★★★★★#6Tower of Dawn★★★★★She was fire, she was darkness, she was dust and blood and shadow.As anyone who knows my taste in books is already aware of, I’m total trash for Sarah’s other series,A Court of Thorns and Roses, and have been for a while, which is why I know it’s kind of surprising to a lot of people (myself included) that it’s taken me this long tofinallystart on this series! That said, I decided that I would make an effort in 2018 to get caught up on the series before the finale this fall, and per Sarah’s own website’s recommendation, I started with this novella bind-up.I was honestly nervous to pick this book up, because I kept thinking, “What if it doesn’t live up to my love for the ACOTAR series?!” Luckily, my concerns seem to be invalid – based on this collection, at least – because losing myself in the word of Celaena and the Assassins was effortless, and made me so eager to move on toThrone of Glass!Quiet as mice, quiet as the wind, quiet as the grave.→The Assassin and the Pirate Lord– ★★★★★ ←Celaena thinks that she and her colleague Sam Cortland are being sent to meet the Pirate Lord to seek repayment for a slight he’s caused the King of the Assassins. Upon arrival, the teens learn that they’ve been tricked into an escort mission for a batch of slaves that Arobynn is hoping to sell. I thought this was an fantastic introduction to Celaena’s character, and it immediately made me fond of her as a protagonist. I loved that she was willing to risk her career and her name to free a few hundred strangers, and the ending set a wonderful stage for her relationship with Sam and his willingness to follow her, no matter the cost.→The Assassin and the Healer– ★★★★☆ ←After the debacle with the Pirate Lord, Celaena is sent away for a while, as part of her punishment. In this installment, she stays at the White Pig Inn, where she meets Yrene Towers, a young healer barely scraping by as a waitress, and in desperate need of learning how to defend herself. Who better to teach her than a trained killer? This was my least favorite of the stories, but I still thought it was enjoyable enough for 4 stars. It just didn’t feel nearly as three-dimensional as the other novellas (which is to be expected, since it’s substantially shorter at only 40 pages).→The Assassin and the Desert– ★★★★★ ←As Celaena arrives in the Red Desert, she begins her punishment: training with the Silent Assassins, and earning a letter of recommendation from their leader, the Mute Master. This was such a fleshed out, well written story, and while reading this one, I remember thinking to myself that this was where the realstory tellingin this collection began. I loved getting to know the ins and outs of the Silent Assassins and their homes, as well as watching Celaena’s friendship with Ansel come into form. Most of all, I enjoyed the world-building that was given in bits here and there, like the story of Spidersilk.→The Assassin and the Underworld– ★★★★★ ←Upon her return to Rifthold, Arobynn surprises Celaena by apologizing, and offering her a mission picked specially for her: to kill a man who wants to help the King of Adarlan create a booming slave business. This story was positively gut-wrenching to watch unfold. Without spoiling anything, I’ll just say that certain aspects of Celaena’s mission seemed suspicious from the beginning; Sarah J. Maas is the queen of painful foreshadowing, but like any other trickery she inflicts upon her readers, all you can do is sit back and watch it unfold.→The Assassin and the Empire– ★★★★★ ←A few weeks after Celaena discovers Arobynn’s treachery, she and Sam are living happily on their own, but there’s one problem: to leave Rifthold and Arobynn behind forever, they must leave the Assassin’s Guild, and that costs coins that are going to require one last, dangerous job. Just… see what I said about the last story: with SJM’s writing, sometimes youknowsomething horrible is well on its way, but there’s nothing you can do besides waiting patiently for the heartache. I didn’t think I had grown quite so attached to the characters in this collection until reaching the end of this particular novella, but I found myself devastated and immediately wanting more. I think this was a brilliant story to end this collection on, and it cemented my beliefs thatThe Assassin’s Bladeis the perfect opening to this series.“My name is Celaena Sardothien,” she whispered, “and I will not be afraid.”'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '*4.5 Stars*""My name is Celaena Sardothien,"" she whispered ""and I will not be afraid.""Reading this book for the second time and I am equally if not more heartbroken than the first time I read it. Each novella grabs your attention and wraps you up in adventure and intrigue. Celaena is such a compelling fmc. She is gloriously flawed. Impulsive, stubborn and cocky but also generous, strong and confident. I love all of her wonderful nuances. Considering she is 16/17 I think it tracks and I appreciate the genuine feel of her personality given her age and her history. Every single secondary character in this books feeds something to the reader, nothing is wasted, and I love how it shapes the way the plot moves forward in the following books and how you perceive Celaena.The Assassin and the Pirate Lord- Our introduction to Celaena starts off with a bang! Assassin guilds and a murder. Pirates and brawls. Slave trades and rivals.Highlights-Captain Rolfe, Sam (aka perfect angel baby), Celaena going to the mat for what she believes to be right and working with Sam.""If you ever tell anyone about me embracing you...... I\'ll gut you.""😜The Assassin and the Healer-💙Yrene Towers💙Celaena teaching Yrene to defend herself makes my heart squeeze.""If you get the chance, teach it to any female who will take the time to listen.""We love a girl\'s girl!!The Assassin and the Dessert- I love the vibes of this novella! The Fortress, the dessert, the horses, the master, and the BETRAYAL! It\'s all just such a mood! The characters you meet in this novella are so interesting and setting is captivating.""If you can learn to endure pain, you can survive anything. Some people learn to embrace it-to love it. Some endure it through drowning it in sorrow, or by making themselves forget. Others turn it into anger.""The Assassin and the UnderworldThis novella you start to see the depths of the power Arobynn holds over Celaena, after years of grooming and manipulating her since she was a child and it\'s heartbreaking and infuriating. Sam is just perfect; I love him so much and he\'s everything and I want to strangle Celaena so many times bc COME ON!!""I love you, I have for years. And he hurt you and made me watch because he\'s always known how I felt, too. But if I asked you to pick, you\'d choose Arobynn and I. Can\'t. Take. It.""The Assassin and the Empire- The one that broke me and I have never ever recovered. 😭Why?! Just WHY?!! It was so obvious, and it could have been avoided so easily!! That person deserved better, and I will never be okay with it. Also, ""I hate packing""?!!!! ARE YOU FREAKING SERIOUS?!! SAY IT BACK!!!! Just, I can\'t.""I just want to be with you, I don\'t care where we go.

From small town West Virginia to upscale California, from downtown Boston to rural Texas, the two hunters collide in an annual game of blood and suffering, one that pits them against the most dangerous monsters in the country. But as their friendship develops into something more, the restless ghosts left in their wake are only a few steps behind, ready to claim more than just their newfound love.

I have really enjoyed the other books I have read by Brynne Weaver but she really out did herself with this one. When I read the trigger warning I was only mildly concerned, mostly because I genuinely thought one of the main characters was going to be a cannibal, and I can happily say do not worry because that is not at all the case lmfao. The “not so accidental cannibalism” was actually a very funny addition to the book. Rowan, the MMC, had a lot to live up to with a name like that and I can fully say that he did.

A shock, as I’m sure you can imagine, since it’s literally about SERIAL KILLERS who play a MURDER GAME together and fall in love along the way. But it finally hit me around the ¾ mark that I’d rather get my eyeballs plucked—nay,gouged—out, than continue to be subjected toButcher & Blackbird’sunconvincing chemistry, shallow characters, and disjointed timeline.Dissatisfying as a romance and horror novel, alike.

I love any book that combines murder and romance but the fact that they're also serial killers! I knew I was going to love this one. This book combines gory murder, comedic relief, an at sometimes absurd plot, and a sweet romance so well.

It was supposed to be a dark romantic comedy, and I devoured it—in one sitting. The story revolves around two notorious serial killers, Sloane and Rowan, who organize an annual murder competition. They meet every few months to kill their chosen victim. It sounded so good that I could hardly believe it would turn out to be anything other than amazing. And I was right—it was amazing.Let’s get to the point though—the main characters. The spoilers also start here!Rowan Kane, aka my new obsession. Seriously. I’m pretty sure I’ve discovered my new type— a serial killer with golden retriever energy who also happens to fit the “tall, dark, and mysterious” type. He rides a motorcycle, has tattoos, and owns popular restaurants where he’s the chef. Restaurants he named after the heroine, with a booth forever reserved just for her. I love fictional rich men.This man was also insane, crazy, and a bit nuts. Yes, I know those words essentially mean the same thing, but as you read, you’ll see they describe him perfectly. It doesn’t change the fact that he was hot though. Who wouldn’t want a crazy, comedian guy who’s completely obsessed with you? The best part is that most of the time, he wasn’t even trying to be funny, but what he said was so utterly unserious that I ended up laughing anyway.""his gaze remains trapped on the trail of tiny white worms heading my way. When his eyes lift from the floor, they meet mine with an eager smile. “Want to get lunch?”It was so out of nowhere that I laugh.""As he collects his bike, I ask him what he’s going to do with all this cash, and he tells me he’s saving for a PlayStation. Before he goes, I give him an extra two hundred bucks.""Skskksjsjsjsk he made a deal with some kid to bring Sloane groceries so he could help her cook over the phone. Despite standing secretly outside her house.""Rowan’s reply is immediate.Hold tight, love. I’m coming.""And he calls her \'love\'. That should be enough to love this man.“You’re beautiful, Rowan.”This time, it’s my turn to blush.""And he blushes. *screaming*""Do you really think I just like you when I framed a drawing you left for me on a scrap of paper you tore from a notebook? The one I hung it in the kitchen so I can look at it every day and think of you? Do you think I just like you when I tattoo it on my skin?""*SCREAMINGGGGGG*""Rowan rests the handle of the ax against his shoulder and huffs before giving me a wink. “Getting revenge for hurting my girl, of course.""\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200eFor safety reasons—because I know it matters to some people, myself included-he was celibate from the moment he first laid eyes on her and became obsessed. Four years. The fact that he fangirled over her when they first met was also ridiculously cute. Yes, cute. A grown man can be cute -though this only applies to fictional men.Now, onto our heroine, Sloane. I absolutely loved her. Who cares if she was a serial killer? At least she looked hot while doing it. Killing terrible men and never getting caught? A girl can only dream.“Just…hold…still…” Sloane says, gritting out every word over the man’s garbled cries.“I’d say it would hurt less if you stop struggling, but that’s a total lie.” The man screams again and I turn my head toward the sound.""This book is a perfect example of how you can write a dark romance featuring two serial killers whose relationship is built on friendship, not lust. It took them four years to finally get together, and I loved that they were friends during all that time—best friends, even. Rowan was certain about them, about what they could be, and what he wanted, patiently waiting for Sloane to catch up. The best part is that he wasn’t out there being a player all those years. The man was so obsessed, he only wanted her. As he should.Now, about the “Accidental Cannibalism” and “Not-So-Accidental Cannibalism,” which initially drew me to this book despite my fears of how it might turn out. The first incident happened during one of their kills when Rowan unknowingly ate the meal their victim had prepared for them. You can probably guess what it was. The second situation? Well, that would be too much of a spoiler, but let’s just say that neither of them consumed it. Thankfully.Overall, I’m so glad I decided to read this because I was quite skeptical at first. I can’t wait to dive into the Rowan brothers’ books. There are so many hints about who they’ll be paired with, and I just can’t wait.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'absolutely horrendous book.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Oh boy! I can say three things firstly:-This stimulating, scorching, action-packed, mind-bending, heart-pounding, intelligent, and highly entertaining novel, seamlessly blending thriller, mystery, dark comedy, and erotic romance genres, has become my new addiction, making me want to scream my adoration for it from the rooftops!-I\'ve undoubtedly found another auto-approved author, and I can\'t wait to read more from Brynne Weaver and the ""Ruinous Love Trilogy"" books!

I will definitely be passing on those meals!This book has an unusual plot revolving around two serial killers who compete with each other to finish the job of their targeted evil. Yes, they are like vigilantes, cleaning the world of the most malicious human beings, even though both of them also enjoy the blood, turning crime scenes into art exhibitions to feed their violent fantasies.Sloane, the orb weaver, a.k.a. ""Blackbird,"" finds her path crossing with Irish charm, dangerous, charismatic Rowan, a.k.a. Butcher when she accidentally locks herself with her latest prey in a cage for three days in the Louisiana summer. Rowan unleashes her and comes with a proposal that intrigues her, just like the man who tells her the rules. Their attraction is palpable, wild, animalistic, and barely controllable. They decide to play an annual game to hunt their targeted victims by choosing them around the most dangerous monsters hiding in human clothing. Their blossoming friendship and attraction lead them to places they could never imagine.Will they be each other’s destruction, or are they just a match made in hell, destined to find their own kind of bloody, highly eccentric, stimulating, sensational happily ever after?Wow! Just wow! My mind is ready to explore! This book is entertaining, smart, unputdownable, and those steamy, naughty scenes definitely set the chapters on fire! They\'re absolutely hyperventilating!

Weaver\'s words perfectly craft a world of sights, sounds, and smells of 19th century London in your imagination. The atmosphere is impressively heavy, packed with tension and intrigue. Weaver has created a character with resilience and tenacity, and I found myself cheering her on the whole time.I also was fortunate enough to listen to theaudiobook:(Listen ""Butcher & Blackbird"" Audiobook). The person who narrates does a great job giving depth and emotion to each character in the story. I\'d highly suggest picking up this book if you like historical mysteries, strong female leads, and atmospheres that will paint pictures in your mind. .'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '""Sloane.I can\'t lose you.""""Then you\'d better kiss me.""✔️ Dark romcom✔️ Friends to lovers (they\'re both serial killers)✔️ Reverse grumpy x sunshine✔️ Forced proximity✔️ Only one bed✔️ He falls first and hard✔️ Touch him/her and dieWell that was a WILD ride and so fun. Although I expected a lot more cause the hype got to me.I likedRowan and Sloane.Their banter was EVERYTHING. Their dynamic with each other was so well built. The way Sloane opened up to him and the way Rowan was always rooting for her, waiting for her and just loving her was so beautiful to read. Both of them were so protective towards each other, going to lengths for each other and never giving up, I loved that. As individuals too they shined. One did not overpower the other and was quite balanced.The action bits were quite vividly described which I did have an issue with at one point in the book. There\'s a lot of gore. A LOT. In fact, more so than the spice. I was not so much invested in the plot or what they did as much as their romance which iswhy this is a three star read for me.These might bejust me issuesbut once I read about Sloane\'s genital piercing, I just wasn\'t able to ignore it during the spice. Sorry 😂🙈 Another thing am not appreciative of was that there was a lot of swearing in this. I don\'t mind how much one swears but using God\'s name in vain got to me...Theendingwas quite good and explosive. I like Lachlan a lot, he was probably my favorite character so I\'ll look forward to his book. Overall, a decent read.There\'s a long list of TW, so please check it out before reading.

It’s about two serial killers who fall in love while playing in hunting and killing competitions. They are psychopaths, they are tortured souls, this is dark; brace yourself for that. But outside of the morbidity and gore, this was a cute and sweet, slow burn. How did this author do that? How did she make us root for two murderers, watch them play with their victims brutally and without conscience and feel swoony at the romance of it? I dunno, scientists need to look into this.So if you like cool banter, sweet (but psycho) characters, funny side characters and can handle or embrace very dark content, then try this. It’s a hoot.It doesn’t get full five stars because the time jumps got really annoying to me and I wanted more time of them actually together and I think certain scenes were jumped over that I wished were included.

It has serial killers and gore mixed with rom-com mixed with kinky smut scenes. It starts off hot and just ramps up from there. The writing style in B&B pushes right up against the edge of being cheesy, in the best way. If you like a fun rom-com and you don\'t mind some violence and gore, youhaveto read this book.Brynne made two absolutely adorable serial killers for us to get to know throughout this story. Sloane is such a badass and a little bit of a psycho, while also being lovable and relatable as a character. Rowan is an absolutely dreamy, overprotective, deeply caring MMC and his little irish accent really just takes him into perfect book boyfriend territory. There are several long time gaps in this story, which I am really grateful for. It allowed for their relationship to grow in a way that felt natural and believable. I\'m always a fan of giving the two MCs a lot of time to get to know each other before it gets spicy.The smut scenes in this book are delicious. Our main characters are a little kinky, just enough to really make things interesting and steamy. Yet, also vanilla enough to be enjoyable to a broad audience. I hope this is the kind of content we continue to see through the other two books in this series.My only complaint with this book is that it treats time and money as unlimited resources for our MCs. Sloane and Rowan always had the cash and time off to do anything they wanted or needed. I understand why this is done for ease of story, but it is just one spot where I feel like I had to really suspend my disbelief and just roll with it.Finally, the audiobook. I cannot say enough good things about this audiobook. Both of the VAs delivered beautifully, their acting was lovely and they just did a great job. The quality of the recording is fantastic, there\'s no weird background sounds or other technical issues with the audio itself. What really makes the audiobook stand out is the duet style of the reading. The actors each read all of their own voice lines, as well as their own POV chapters. So, when Sloane has a chapter it is still Joe Arden speaking the Rowan lines, instead of Lucy Rivers trying to do a Joe Arden voice. This was my first experience with a duet style audiobook and I was genuinely so blown away and so happy while listening to it. It is a nice middle ground between a regular style audiobook and a full graphic audio experience. I think I prefer it over either of them and I desperately hope that more authors take the time to get their books narrated this way. I cannot stress enough how much this added to the listening experience.Something to note, there is a pretty important bonus chapter at the end of Butcher and Blackbird, my copy of the audiobook did not include this chapter. I don\'t know if it is in some versions and not mine or if you need a print copy to get that chapter. If you only listen to the audiobook, make sure to find a copy of skullduggery.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4.25 ⭐️ This book was a riot that I couldn\'t put down!We\'re not normal people.

Check the author\'s TW before reading.My Thoughts:This was a delight - a weird, fucked up delight. 😂 It\'s a very original story, and regardless of all the trigger warnings above, it’s actually incredibly fun and comical. I don’t know how the author managed to write a gore filled rom-com about serial killers but she KILLED IT! (pun intended)*I’ve also listened to the audiobook and OMG is it amazing!!! The narrators do an incredible job!*Update:Due to the serious allegations against Joe Arden (who voices the male narrator), Brynn Weave no longer supports/promotes the audiobook, nor do I. So instead, please support Brynn byreadingthe book.I absolutely adored the MCs: Sloane and Rowan.These two are such interesting characters with some obvious trauma that\'s led them to become killers, but what I love most is that they see each other for exactly who they are and instead of being afraid or wanting the other to change, they embrace all of it and love those parts. They honestly make such a cute couple and hey, I condone their killings since they only target terrible serial killers. It\'s not like they\'re hurting innocents.Also, the fact Rowan has a table permanently reserved for Sloane at his restaurant after meeting her one time melted my heart! Talk about obsessed.I adored the found family/family relationships in this story.Sloane has her best friend Lark and Rowan has his two brothers who are fully aware and supportive of their killing hobby. I totally didn\'t expect this and found it very endearing. There\'s something special about relationships where they see all of you, the good and the bad, and they love you regardless.The smut SLAYED!Not only are there a lot of spicy scenes but they were filthy and kinky. Rowan is very dominating in bed and takes just as much as he gives. I also think it\'s badass that Sloane has 🐱 piercings.I saw the twist coming but it was still entertaining.I buddy read this with a friend who didn\'t see the twists, so it may not be that obvious. But I promise you, regardless of if you catch it or not, you\'ll love the end. It\'s riveting and will have you at the edge of your seat!There were only two things I didn\'t like:1. I wish we got a bit more background into Sloane\'s past besides vague mentions of what happened to fuck her up. We can gather there was SA at the boarding school she went to with Lark, but I wasn\'t 100% sure, so I thought there needed to be a bit more specifics and insight into Sloane\'s feelings about everything that happened (including killing the teacher).2. Sloane repeatedly says ""you\'re the worst"" to Rowan and it becomes a sort of catch phrase, which would have been fine if she didn\'t say it around 10 times throughout the story. Definitely overkill.Overall, this was an entertaining book and I\'d 100% recommend it if you can handle the trigger warnings. It\'s similar to the Mindf*ck series by S.T. Abby because of the whole female serial killer but it has a much lighter tone and a lot more laughs. I have no idea what\'s in store for Lark and Fionn in book 2 but I cannot wait to find out!Favorite Quotes:""I didn\'t gouge them out, Butcher. I plucked them. Delicately. Like a lady.""_______""You know what they say, Blackbird. \'It\'s all fun and games until someone loses and eye.\' And that\'s where the real fun begins.""_______“That woman you were watching…?” My fingers tighten around his throat as he desperately nods. “She is mine.” I’m sure he begs. But I don’t hear his pleas. They’re fucking useless words that won’t save him now._______I refuse to lose her. Sloane is the only person in the world who can look at my monster and find a friend. And I know she needs a friend just as much as I do. Maybe more._______He knows my darkest secrets. I know his. We can be monsters, and maybe we don’t deserve the same things that other people do. Happiness. Affection. Love. But I can’t seem to stop the way I feel when I look at every facet of Rowan, from his brightest light to his deepest, most dangerous dark. Maybe I don’t deserve it for the things I’ve done. But I want it. I want more with him than what I’ve got._______Sloane bleeds into every thought. When we\'re apart, her absence is an entity. I worry for her. I dream of her. And yesterday, I almost lost her. Killing bounds us together, and it\'s a compulsion neither of us can live without. This need, and now this game between us, consumes me as much as she does._______Every time I think of her, my heart reminds me I\'m not as dead on the inside as I thought after all._______""You\'re all the best things to me, Sloane. No matter how many bruises are in your heart or on your skin.""_______""How do you still have the energy to take the piss out of me?""""I always have the energy for that. Your suffering is my number one priority.""_______""Before you came along, something was missing. You, Rowan. You were missing. You made it safe to feel seen. Safe to play on our terms. Safe to have fun, even though our fun might not be everyone\'s idea of a good time.""_______“Pick a safe word. Do it now.”I swallow. Hard. “Chainsaw.”He huffs a laugh, a burst of warmth against my core.“How fitting, love. Now be a good girl and find something to grab on to…” he says, then passes one long, slow lick over my center. “...Because I’m about to destroy you.”_______I told her I\'m no angel. I don\'t think she believed me. But she\'s about to discover that I\'m the devil she never knew she needed._______She\'s everywhere, in every drop of my blood, in every spark of thought, and I want to fucking destroy her for it. To shatter her just like she\'s broken me. Because she brings me to my fucking knees. I want to ruin her so that she\'s mine, my beautiful disaster. My wild creature. My goddess of chaos._______""I would kill for you, and I have. I would do it again, every damn day. I\'d turn myself inside out for you. I would die for you. I don\'t just like you, Sloane, and you fucking know it.""_______I know I\'m not a normal person, but I don\'t feel like a monster. I feel like a weapon. The final justice on behalf of those who can\'t speak, delivering punishment for those who don\'t deserve clemency._______""You have never been unlovable. You were just waiting for someone who will love you for who you are, not for who they want you to be. I can do that, if you let me.""_______""You might be a psycho, but you\'re my psycho, and I\'m yours.

House of Earth and Blood (Crescent City, #1)
",Sarah J. Maas,4.47,854772,240300,"Romance, Fantasy, Fiction, Romantasy, Fantasy Romance, Urban Fantasy, Adult",803,03-03-2020,"Bryce Quinlan had the perfect life-working hard all day and partying all night-until a demon murdered her closest friends, leaving her bereft, wounded, and alone. When the accused is behind bars but the crimes start up again, Bryce finds herself at the heart of the investigation. She'll do whatever it takes to avenge their deaths.Hunt Athalar is a notorious Fallen angel, now enslaved to the Archangels he once attempted to overthrow. His brutal skills and incredible strength have been set to one purpose-to assassinate his boss's enemies, no questions asked. But with a demon wreaking havoc in the city, he's offered an irresistible deal: help Bryce find the murderer, and his freedom will be within reach.As Bryce and Hunt dig deep into Crescent City's underbelly, they discover a dark power that threatens everything and everyone they hold dear, and they find, in each other, a blazing passion-one that could set them both free, if they'd only let it.With unforgettable characters, sizzling romance, and page-turning suspense, this richly inventive new fantasy series by #1 New York Times bestselling author Sarah J. Maas delves into the heartache of loss, the price of freedom-and the power of love.","[{'rating': 5, 'content': 'Excuse me while I borrow a phrase from Fynn to convey my very sophisticated language while reading this monster of a book:what the fucking fuck.Memento Mori.Remember that you will die.Reading HoEaB is like listening to rock (maybe goth, punk, or alternative) mixed with trap:slightly jarring and odd with a hard edge, dark vibe, and pacing that goes from low to explosions and thunder. Which is something I love but you might not. No, this was not perfect. And yes, it fell shorter than the revolutionary it could’ve been. Nonetheless, it was a unique masterpiece to me because, of all of SJM’s works, this is the most surreal yet real, casual yet grand, the grittiest and most intriguing.With a more mature storytelling and a painstakingly-crafted, cruel world in defiance of the fairytal-ish-ness of ACoTaR,House of Earth and Bloodsets itself apart from her earlier works, bringing in a detailed urban/high fantasy and noir atmosphere of mystery, drugs, sex, war, and epicness all in one book, with a refreshing twist on the Chosen One trope while exploring the power of sacrifice and unflinching trust in love.Light it up, bitch.To be frank with you, this sagacious mammoth of a book is more like an entire series, taking you through a journey so long and eventually satisfying with so much character development that one might say it istoolong. And perhaps I first agreed until I realised that I wouldn’t give up a single syllable and lose the characters and world.Yes, it’s very slow for the first halfbut, when slow is interesting, it ends up paying off even better than fast paced as all those tied up threads snap in the longest, most exquisite climax to have graced my book shelves. HoEaB has about 200 pages of reveals and beautiful, glorious, touching battles, which is probably 4 times as many as any book. I think it deserves a break for having only twice as much a slow paced trying-to-unravel-a-baffling-murder-mystery tale.Through love, all is possible.In the end, for someone who doesn’t believe in love and will in all likelihood never be capable of feeling it towards any human being,Crescent Cityhad me weeping and laughing and clapping and being filled with sheer blinding dread while sobbing at the above quote, all within mere paragraphs of one another. Yes, it’s cheesy, but it’s brave and iconic and I appreciated it?I have one very vital question tho:if this was the 1st book, WHAT CRUSHING EPIC HEL IS GONNA BE THE REST?(look for my playlist at the end of the review to enhance your reading experience even more!)↳CW➯ explicit language, drug use, graphic mature content, slavery, abuse, gore, violence, mutilation, speciesism (magical species over mortals), death, loss of loved ones, depression, suicide attempt (mentioned)↳⋆☽ Storyline ☾⋆Three realms make up the capital of the Valbara territory: the mer in the river, the Reapers and the dead upon the misty shores of the Bone Quarter, and the residents of Lunathion proper—all ruled by the seven Heads of the Crescent City aka seven powerful rulers from different species except, ofc, humans, because you bethumanshaveno power.Which would explain the Ophion rebellion of humans now armed with guns and bombs, currently creating scenes of massacre in the planet’s capital.“Magic and machines. Never a good mix.”Bryce Quinlan,a powerless and completely ordinary half-breed shunned from both sides of society and content to lose herself in her high-on-drugs-and-sex-and-youth lifestyle as a sorceress’s assistant, wants nothing to do with their antics.Until the leader of the rebels in the city gets released, and then...you know how it goes: people Bryce loves die, the government quickly apprehends the bastard, and all is good.Fast forward two years, the city rebels have shut the Hel up but people are, again, dying in precisely the same gruesome way—chopped into pieces. Could it be that the rebels were not responsible for the deaths two years ago? Then, could someone please explain to me,what the shit is going on?Thankfully, that’s exactly what Bryce, with the help of Hunt Athalar—a once-upon-a-time rebel angel enslaved to the very regime he hoped to overthrow 200 years ago—is assigned to find out.And you bet your arse nothing is as it seems.↳⋆☽ Storytelling ☾⋆Allow me to introduce you to Sarah’s best writing wrapped up in one book.I could tell you about the devouring, addictive atmosphere building that captures theurban fantasy mashed up with high fantasy and noirworld brilliantly, making use of modernised naming, casual expression-and-slang-filled conversations, deftly written descriptions of drug-addled minds, and generally diving into real and gritty notes on the world—from flashing banners to the inane TV shows.Or, I could tell you about her no-nonsense storytelling that as usualdoesn’t shy away from any part of life—be it a female’s cramps or sex or annoying behaviours in the bedroom or depression or cursing (which you’ll never hear me complaining about) and how considerate she is of everything including qualifications of medical experimentations.I could even tell you about her easy way with words that paints images straightforward while bursting with the occasional apt turn of phrase, stayingmore mature than her previous workswithout any overly poetic and dramatic passages constantly popping up yet still expertly trapping yours and the characters’ emotions to do with them as she wishes.But I won’t.↳⋆☽ Characters ☾⋆“Everyone, General, is for sale. You just have to figure out the asking price.”★Bryceis one of the most unlikely MCs, starting from a place of abandon and looking to find her worth, having a real chip on her shoulder when it comes to males and getting riled up rather quickly (while sometimes even unprovoked) about feministic matters, being denied a dancing career because of her body type, this curvy party girl brings a more ignored type of characters into the spotlight. With her,SJM comfortably shoulders themes like casual sex and drugs, handling them with such rareease.“I was told my half-human body was too clunky. I was also told that my boobs were too big, and my ass could be used as an aerialport landing pad.”What surprises me most is that, despite her being a self sacrificing idiot, I grew to adore her. She’s not the stereotypical bore of a brave hero, she’s smart, real, tangible, messed up, and full of flaws. I realise this is Sarah’s preference in leading characters, as is dealing with loss and trauma, apparently. But I’m not complaining becauseher exploration of these subjects grows with each series, adding something different, something similar—all complementing eachother.“No one gets a medal for suffering the most, you know,”✯Huntthe Haunted Boy bore such utter loss and loneliness that I couldn’tnotlike him. I appreciate that he respected her despite being an occasional idiot yet loyal puppy, but he lacked a certainsolidityto his character that all of Maas’s other male characters still had. Such a shame.“I have no idea what to do.”“I’m two hundred thirty-three years old, and I’m still figuring it out.”✮Danika,reckless, wild, loyal unto death, awe-inspiring alpha with a life forced upon her and the usual choice for lead;Ruhn,my precious defiant crown prince and Chosen One of the Fae, but a brother above all else; contained and messed upFury; unwaveringJune;unforgettable and pricelessLele;Flynnand his reflection of the responsibility-fleeing youth; charmingTharion;humbleIsaiah;and mysterious and darkAidasI need more of...all own a piece of my heart now.“You told me not to let them see me cry. I took the advice to heart.”↳⋆☽ Relationships ☾⋆✰Friendship:Danika and Bryce’s bond is probably one of the most beautiful things SJM has written. The sisterly support, the unwavering loyalty, the faith...it just leaps out of the page and grabs you by the throat until you are choking and crying begging for it to stop. I have no words as I’m still choking on those ruthless sobs.Truth be told, Sarah’sfocus on the significance of friendship (even in a romance)above all else and her masterful tackling of its muddy waters is the best thing about all her works.“That’s the point of it, Bryce. Of life. To live, to love, knowing that it might all vanish tomorrow. It makes everything that much more precious.”✰Romance:What I love most about this facet of the story is its focus on everythingNOT toxic masculinity, and while I disagree that her previous works dwelled in this area (as the focal point of all her endgame romances have been friendship, equality, and mutual understanding and respect) we have had characters who’ve been tolerant of the much more animalistic instincts of the Fae as well as ones who battled those instincts and all but declared that it’s important to respect your partner’s wishes rather than act possessively; here, she takes the last step to declare it and shows that she can write different dynamics with adding Bryce, who isn’t tolerant of it.Yes, Bryce and Hunt might not be my fave ship, might not be a heartthrob, but not every ship has to own my heart. What matters is how they fit and how precious their bond is. Though TBH I prefer it as friendship.✰Mother-Daughter:A gem of pure strength. My icy heart melted.✰Brother-Sister:Having to deal with two older brothers who I can’t call overbearing or annoying as, honestly, I’m the unbearable one they have to bear with, I always crave these relationships in books (and hate how uncommon they are in works of fantasy). Well, my prayers have been answered! Can I have more of this preciously and precisely captured dynamic, please?↳⋆☽ Worldbuilding ☾⋆What word can I use to convey my adoration for this world? Inventive? Fascinating? Layered?House of Earth and Blood(which is also the name of one of the 4 Houses of Midgard, if you’re wondering) takes oninequality in a brutal regime while combining magic and technology in a dazzling manner—with scientists, tourists, blood tests checking one’s power, a system to monitor the vibrations in the world’s magic, and a sword in a cave (Jumong + Arthur much?),SJM has thoughtfully became the architect of her most ingenious world yet.Magic and technology; I never ceased to be amazed by the balance and contrast of how these two elements were mixed; how naturally it was managed. Not to mention the spin on the traits of angels (as we know SJM loves to do, now inspired by angels in Judaism), changing them from holy, perfect idols to arrogant bastards. And there is, ofc, the usual animalistic Fae and shifters touch on the usually-known-as serene creatures—some would dislike her focus on their lupine and canine and feline sides, perhaps finding it uncomfortable, but to me, it is refreshing and precise, as itfeels more grittily realistic. What are humans but slightly more intelligent animals? And demonstrating how said connection to the wilds would affect these individuals is a sprinkle of accuracy in Maas’s favour.InCrescent City, Maas is inspired by multiple mythologies and uses the occasional familiar name to make all the foreign and new information less overwhelming while providing a new outlook on their definitions with clever new interpretations. Such as Midgard, originally land of the mortals between Asgard (land of the gods) and Helheim (land of the dead) in Norse mythology, here used as the name of the planet mortals made their lives upon before the godlike magical beings left their worlds and pushed in from the Northern Rift, also hosting the Quiet Realms were the dead dwell.Midgard is a world divided by power. Literally. There are tests to determine a Vanir’s level of magic, and the one bearing more of it stands higher on the hierarchy (the down to earth ones having a celebrity-like position in the society). And humans, with no power, do not get much credit despite their efforts in guiding the city to technological advancement, having their achievements funded and claimed by rulers who are smart enough not to leave room for their inferior species thriving while they themselves cling to old traditions.Additionally, as fits the urban fantasy genre, the focus is on the city and its world building—so while we learn about the system of the planet in general, most of our knowledge and wanderings happen within the confines of Lunathion, a city holding the same nickname as New Orleans, and throwing nudges to it in more than one way.All together, the world ofCrescent Cityisso rich it’s dripping in gems and shadows and drugs, and its exquisite creatures, artfully shaped and accordingly named landscapes, temples of pleasure, and magical libraries with sneaky books could sweep you beneath its dark waves and crush you in the jaws of the horrifying nøkks waiting for your boat to tip.Note: I was right!This is the “glittering city on the curve of a river,” mentioned in Kingdom of Ash. The fact that all of SJM’s worlds exist in the same universe just brings so many possibilities to the table, and I absolutely love it.I will now proceed to the Quiet Realm of the dead, all the way across the crescent river, on my worn boat, ready to tip and leave me to drown in its dark, bloody waters.↳⋆☽ Companions ☾⋆↬Book playlist:Spotify URL↬Books in series:⟿ House of Earth and Blood (Crescent City, #1) ★★★★★⟿Untitled Sequel(Crescent City, #2) ☆☆☆☆☆'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '[rtc after rereading]All the fucking stars in the universe. ALL OF THEM.First off,let me start by saying no review, no matter how eloquent or long or detailed, will ever completely let me convey my feelings about this book. Ever. Because I HAD FEELINGS and they wrecked me completely.If you don\'t know me, that means that this is going to be really, really long. With way too much fangirling and incoherent raving.I have heard a lot of complaints about the first half of this book being slow. Not to me. I read intensely through the whole book, though I was completelyinvestedin the last quarter (which was like 200 pages, but still). Maybe it’s just because of my personal preferences because the first part of the book was really world-building, which I love. Ilovewhen a book has strong, intricate world-building. It’s one of my major weaknesses in books.“The universe is massive. Some believe it has no end. Or that our universe might be one in a multitude, as bountiful as the stars in the sky or the sand on a beach.”Characterization.Always, always, always a huge hit for me. Obviously, going into this I knew it was going to be incredible because, seriously, this is a fucking Sarah J. Maas book. She did not disappoint.Also, may I point out that this book has more inclusion of races and sexualities than SJM\'s other books.Bryce Quinlan– the gorgeous, flippant, badass, wrecked, understanding, sassy, party-girl protagonist whose sarcasm, intelligence, secrets, and all-aroundbadass-nessis so damn incredible. You can tell as soon as you read her comebacks that she is the epitome of an SJM female protagonist. In other words, utterly fucking perfect. I could write a 500-page book on how much I love Bryce and still not have enough (500 pages becauseI’m a lazy ass andI could just use 1-point font)Danika Fendyr– the powerful, loyal, equally-badass, lethal, terrifying, never-to-be-underestimated, equally-party-girl, incredibly-fucking-strong Alpha wolf shifter who I fell in love with as soon as she opened her mouth. She does not get enough spotlight or recognition and I will NEVER stop talking about her character and how she deserves so much fucking love and appreciation.Hunt Athalar– the powerful, strong, stony, emotionally-wrecked, gorgeous, lethal Fallen Angel and honestly the character with the most amazingly written emotional backstory. I LOVE Hunt and his sensitivity and shocking human-ness, and he never ceased to make me feel emotions. He made me feelemotions. The bonus: he knows how to make coffee and will cook breakfast.Ruhn Danaan– the rebellious, powerful, arrogant domineering Fae prick with a heart of gold and a hidden soft side. I liked his character, but I didn’t love him the way all of the hype said I would. I heard so much obsession over Ruhn before I read the book that I honestly felt let down a bit. Still. He’s a Fae male protagonist written by SJM; how can you not love him? (no, Tamlin doesnotcount as a protagonist)Lehabah– the pretty, little, gossipy, mischievous, caring, talkative, brave, emotional fire sprite who despite being really annoying at times, I still love. She is so amazing and supportive in her own little way and I wish I had a companion like her. She deserves EVERYTHING.Juniper Andromeda– the beautiful, talented, determined, gorgeous, fierce, supportive, loving, sweet, stubborn dancer who refused to let her faun legs stop her from ballet. We don’t get much of her but We. Need. More.Fury Axtar– the lethal, mercenary, terrifying, dark, dangerous, rebellious, sarcastic, notorious assassin whose caring side and lethality are amazing. I loved her. I need more of Fury. Please. I loved her so much.Jesiba Roga– the notorious, cold, imperious, powerful, feared, mysterious, cunning, immortal sorceress who intimidates everyone and often threatens to turn people into animals. No one challenges her, no matter their standing. Overall a badass bitch.Hypaxia Enador– the smart, calculating, unflinching, strong, underestimated badass witch who knows what she’s doing and does not back down. I loved her as soon as she was introduced because even though she was shady, I could tell she was going to be a strong character who deserves so much more spotlightbecause I literally forgot about her while I was writing this review.There’s more to the characters and I could keep going but that would take a long timeand I’m lazy.“There’s nothing wrong with being a party girl. I don’t get why the world thinks there is.” But she considered his words. “It’s easier for me—when people assume the worst about what I am. It lets me see who they really are.”The plot. I admit I went into this not expecting too much based off the synopsis. Well, that’s kind of a lie. I went into this expecting a TON because one, it’s a Sarah J. Maas book, two, the rave review from literally all of my friends, and three, because the idea was fascinating and I had read a sample off Google Books. But the synopsis didn’t do it for me.The book itself, on the other hand, blew myfuckingmind. The twist in the first five chapters that wasn’t even a damn twist, it was just a setup. The plot. The world. Everything. The story progression, character development, story arcs, themes, and ALL OF THE FUCKING PLOT TWISTS that I still haven’t gotten over. I knew Sarah J. Maas would give me an incredible story, of course – I’ve read Throne of Glass and ACOTAR three times each – but I wasn’t sure about her writing a murder mystery.I should never have doubted the queen. Nothing can describe the experience I had reading this book.“Vengeance incarnate. Wrath’s bruised heart. She would bow for no one.”The character trauma that SJM incorporates into all of her books isinsane.I have some pretty rough experiences with grief and depression, and Sarah J. Maas’ books are the best representation of trauma that I have ever read (being a fourteen-year-old, that probably isn’t saying much but I like to consider myself mature). The way she writes their healing, their pain, their darkness, their grief, just feels so real and amazing, and I love it.“That\'s the point of it, Bryce. Of life. To live, to love, knowing that it might all vanish tomorrow. It makes everything that much more precious.”The writing.This is Sarah J. Maas’ first adult book, and I was a bit hesitant to read it at first because her other books are mature enough (*cough* beach scene *cough*). They are…detailed, to say the least, and they have some pretty strong language. I thought Crescent City wouldn’t be that much worse.I mean, it really wasn’t. I don’t mind the F-bombs all over the place – proof of that is scattered throughout this review. I have a lot of exposure to cussing and I toss around the wordfucklike it’s confetti. There was a ton of cussing and a bit more explicit information about male and female interaction, but I honestly think I was desensitized to the cussing part after reading all her other books.“I’m saying I want shit kept quiet.” She grinned at Ruhn, showing all her white teeth, the expression more savage than amused. “I’m saying if you three morons leak any of this to your Aux buddies or drunken hookups, I am going to be very unhappy.”Honestly, Hunt would have liked nothing more than to grab some popcorn and a beer, kick back in a chair, and watch her verbally fillet these assholes.”I don’t care about the bad language. I can cuss people out in a mixture of languages (just ask my classmates). What made me uncomfortable, as a fourteen-year-old girl with basically no dating experience, was theinteractionsthat I was mentioning in the last paragraph. Somehow I’m not as desensitized to those scenes.“Danika just said it. “If he grabs his phone to check his messages before his dick’s barely out of you again, please have the self-respect to kick his balls across the room and come home to me.”The one thing I had an issue with: why are all of SJM’s characters absolutely fucking gorgeous?I know that sounds odd, and jealous and insecure and shit, but it’s true. All the females are lean and toned with gorgeous bodies, pretty hair, and awesome skills, and all of the males are tall, muscular, and powerful. Inallof her books. Even though they’re all mentally and emotionally relatable, they still have these perfect bodies and gorgeous faces and pretty hair and it makes me even more insecure. Excuse me, where are my average people? I already struggle with body image and reading this didn’t really help (still, that’s not enough of a reason to lower my rating of this book because it was just that good.)So. To finish raving (for now at least, because I’m tired of typing and I can’t function enough to think of anything else to write).I did not want to be done when I read the last page. I did not want to finish this book.Because this book wasabsolutely fucking incredible.Going in I knew it was going to be a favorite, but I didn’t realize it was going to be this powerful. This is very possibly Sarah J. Maas’ best book ever, which is fucking saying something. If this is just the first book in the series, then holy shit are we in for a ride with the rest of Crescent City.The main point of this review: I AM TRASH FOR SJM.(Also, the next book is going to be called ""House of Sky and Breath"". I\'m calling it. That\'s what pretty much all of the major characters in this book belonged to and it\'s the next House up from Earth and Blood in the caste system, so it would make sense to go that way.)'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Instagram||Threads||Facebook||Amazon||TikTokGather around, my friends, and pull up several seats. I give you my worst book of 2020. Mygod.My first introduction to Sarah J. Maas\'s work was through THRONE OF GLASS, which sounded kind of like POISON STUDY when I heard the premise: a disgraced assassin fighting for the saving of a kingdom? YAS. But POISON STUDY was a much better book. ""But no,"" said the Stans. ""You have to read the entire series. It gets better."" Well, I read all seven books, and it actually got worse. Maas either killed off or ruined the only characters who made the series halfway okay, and introduced a sleazy, growling alpha motherfucker of a love interest to match Aelin/Caleana\'s Super Senshi Sue Powers™. It got so bad that I joked she would literally have to be a god to become any more special and it\'s like Sarah J. Maas heard me thinking that and was like YAAAAASS QUEEN. I SHALL MAKE IT SO. Ugh.The A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES series is better... in book one. I\'m reading it right now and it might actually be the only book of hers that I\'ll give more than a two star rating, even though it butchers not just The Ballad of Tam Lin but alsoBeauty and the Beast. I have a lot of thoughts on making characters in fairytales and stories where the characters are supposed to be unattractive attractive, which I expand more on in my review of A.G. Howard\'sROSEBLOOD. But everything that makes A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES bearable is destroyed in later books. Maas swaps out a genuinely tortured and flawed love interest for a carbon copy of Rowan who, once again, is a sleazy, growling alpha motherfucker who makes volcanoes erupt with the force of his come and takes to the skies to make the clouds cower with his incredibly male orgasms. And Feyre, who started out reasonably flawed and realistic, as a human who can\'t read and has to scrounge to survive, becomes EVEN MORE SPECIAL AND AMAZING, OMG!!!! SO SPECIAL!Throne of Glasswas a young adult series until the last 2-3 books andACoTaRwas a new adult series (even though it wasn\'t labeled as such), but both of them read as being fairly similar and had similar outcomes. I\'ll admit that my eyebrows shot up to my hairline when it was announced that CRESCENT CITY would be Maas\'s first adult novel, because her other books are clearly marketed at a much younger audience and this seems like an attempt to maintain her fanbase\'s interest as they grow older and outgrow the series. What would her take on ""adult"" content be?I\'ll give you one fucking gods-damn clue what Maas\'s fucking take on gods-damn content is, but first I have to make sure that my fucking vibrator didn\'t fall into the gods-damn box of fuckingMy Little Ponyknock-offs that I fucking keep in my gods-damn linen closet!...That\'s right. PG-13 sexual content and lots and lots and lots andlotsof swearing.Now, I am no prude, but the swearing in this book was totally unnecessary and just came across as childish. If anything, it made CRESCENT CITY feel like a young THRONE OF GLASS trying to impress all of her older friends with her edginess. CRESCENT CITY fancies itself quite the little edgelord with its filthy mouth, drugs, sex, and violence, but none of it is handled well. Drugs are treated as something casually edgy that the charactersdowithout any sorts of repercussions. Violence is casual as well, and doesn\'t really serve any purpose in the story. Characters are killed off before we can really care about them properly. And the sexual content is... cringey.Another issue I took with the book is the way it is constructed. This book was way too long-- about 300 pages longer than it probably should have beenmax. I think Maas has fallen into the trap of just feeding her readers endless self-fanfiction of the stories she\'s already written. They adore her worlds and want to read more of it... but both ACOTAR and THRONE OF GLASS were relatively short. They didn\'t expand in length until the characters (who stayed with her) cared about the series. There is no such emotional bond in CRESCENT CITY,but Maas wrote it as if it were book seven in a seven book series and expected us all to just care. I was reading the comments from stans on the negative reviews who said things like,""Well, it doesn\'t get good until page 500! You should have kept reading!""and""The last 100 pages made the first 700 pages totally worth it!""I\'m sorry, but no. If your book is 800 pages long and doesn\'t get good until page 500, that\'s not okay. If you have 500 pages of info-dumping to get the book get off the ground, you\'re not a good writer. There was way too much crammed into this book and a lot of it was exposition that probably should have happened organically by us following the character around and seeing her interact with things and people instead of having everything dropped on the reader like a ten-ton weight of narrative. I read about 600/800 of this book and I\'m still not sure what I read. It has Norse gods, faeries, vampires, demons, werewolves, shape-shifters, angels, technology, fast food, video games, humans, and a whole host of other stuff, and none of it really meshes cohesively. The world-building is a bigger mess than a drunken mid-2000s party girl stepping out of her limo to greet the paparazzi after an all-night cocaine bender. It doesn\'t make sense, and I don\'t really get how any of it fits together.Then there\'s Bryce. Bryce is basically a mishmash of Celaena and Feyre. She\'s gorgeous. She\'s sexy. Everyone wants to fuck her. She\'s not like other girls. She feels pity for whores because she only sleeps around to self-medicate for her emotional issues. She does drugs but she\'s deep. She hates everyone but everyone\'s okay with that because they can see the pain deep inside her beautiful eyes. Brycaelayre is half-human, half-fae, and ALL Super Senshi Sue™. You just know that she\'s going to end up being revealed to be a ""goddess incarnate"" or the queen of everything by the end of the last book. Maas has never been content to let a female character be powerful on her own merits. She\'s gotta roll her shoulders, roll her eyes, purr, talk sweetly, tap her nails, and flap her aerobicized faerie wings to the heavens while exploding sex, magic, and specialness from every nonexistent pore.The love interest, Hunt, is basically a stand-in for Rowan and Rhysand. I\'m not entirely convinced that he\'s here to stay, though, as Micah was looking pretty fine and fiery and there were way too many paragraphs devoted to talking about how hot he was. Don\'t be surprised if on book 2 or 3, Hunt undergoes a total personality transplant, starts being a dick for no reason, and is then kicked to the curb with the story reworked for how he was secretly an evil gaslighter who was imprisoning Bryce and robbing her of her potential with some half-assed betrayal and only Micah could set her free.WHICH, by the way, the constant use of the word ""alphahole"" in this book was not only incredibly irritating and ridiculous, it\'s also incredibly unselfaware. If you\'re trying to make fun of a trope, it\'s probably best not to have that be a trope that you\'re well-known for. One of the alphahole quotes in this book could literally be a description for any book that Maas has churned out in the last five years. Don\'t even get me started on the whole ""males"" and ""females"" and ""scents"" nonsense.I don\'t think it\'s exaggeration when I say that this is THE WORST MAAS BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. It was so terrible, reading it actually gave me a headache. All of her other books I\'ve read, I could at least finish, but this was unbearable. It was like SJM took everything I hated about her previous books and injected them into CRESCENT CITY in ultra-concentrated form. Theonlytwo redeeming things about this book were the *attempt* at sex-positivity (but only for Bryce-- remember, actual whores are to be pitied) and an odd reference to My Little Pony figures (called ""Starlight Fancy"" figures-- Bryce collects them). Between the terrible, disorganized world-building, the curse-words speckling each page, and the beautiful but two-dimensional shells that served as the main characters, I just could not find one single fuck to give. Maybe because SJM took all those ""fucks"" and put them into her book, instead. You know, to make it ""adult.""1 star'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '2 stars baby. I promise there will be no spoilers in this review, I’m not a monster. Warning: this review is long.Let’s begin with what kept me going throughout this entire book: my stupid tallies.My Stupid Tallies:Characters snarling: 108.This physically hurt me tbh.Characters being described with golden/tan skin: 22.The woke queen is back ladies and gentlemales, with another racially ambiguous cast that lets her imagine them as white but defend herself if people ever say she has no POC in her books. Absolute galaxy brain.Characters purring: 17.Gross.Characters roaring: 9.While much lower than I anticipated, it still was 9 times too many. I have never heard a real-life person do anything close to a “roar” but since “tHEy’rE nOt HuMaN eLLiE” I guess it’s fine.The MMate gross gross grossWord: 2I want to thank this woman for restraining herself in this book, 2 times for her favourite word is incredible, let’s give her a round of applause, guys.The Characters:Bryce Quinlan:Bryce “Silky” Quinlan is first up to the executioner’s block and oh boy do I have some things to say about Bryce. While she is SJM’s typical snarky heroine, she is what I will thusly dubThe Advanced Self-Insert. While Calaena and Feyre were obvious self-inserts (both having golden-hued hair and blue eyes, suspiciously like the author) Bryce actually has RED HAIR, which is honestly a game-changer, a never-before-seen addition to Sarah’s repertoire. I’m so proud of her. Let us list why Bryce isThe Advanced Self-Insert:-\tEvery dude is insanely horny for her. Doesn’t matter if they’re an ancient mythological being or some dude on the street -- he wants to bang her.-\tShe is supremely skilled in the arts of battle. Wielding both a rifle and a sword at once? No problem, despite both weapons requiring two hands. Bryce is just that amazing. Being half-human and therefore physically weaker than almost every character in this book? No problem, the plot will demand she beats them anyway.-\tShe is the most beautiful “female” to ever walk the earth. Nobody compares to Bryce, whose hair is silky beyond words, whose voice is silky, whose walk is silky (???), whose skin is silky. The woman is so silky she will fold if you touch her. Naturally, silk is a complete aphrodisiac for every “male” in this novel, so she is desired by all. People having types? Nope, golden-skinned redheads only baby.But enough about what makes Bryce ridiculously hot, let’s talk about her flaws, and boy are they vast.-\tShe is just too curvy to be a dancer. Her ass and breasts are just too round, too perfect, for her to possibly be a professional dancer.-\tShe attracts “alphaholes” (these are her own words btw) and complains about it despite these alphaholes being the only men she even entertains notions of dating/being with. Maybe her true flaw is that she’s a hypocrite?-\t???-\tDid I mention that she’s really beautiful?A well-rounded character (literally) if I do say so myself.Hunt Athalar:And now we come to our glorious love interest, our Fabio, our physical equal to Bryce. He is a fallen angel (completing SJM’s wing-kink), so renown through the land that he has been dubbed “the Umbra Mortis” or “The Shadow of Death”. The creativity behind this title is unparalleled: not only did she have to think of two words that are “cool and edgy” but she had to put them in google translator and change them into Latin. Think about that for a second … all the time and effort… what a writing queen. I hope to be as powerful as her one day.Anyway, let’s talk about his personality. Like Bryce, he can be quite funny sometimes (I actually love the Jelly Jubilee parts of the novel – see I can be nice). Also, like Bryce, his personality doesn’t really extend past the fact that he is beautiful beyond comprehension and has power never-before-seen for his race (lightning magic, ooOoOoOOOoo). Also like every other powerful character in this novel, he uses this magic a total of once or twice. Because when you make all-powerful characters, you must limit them by not letting them do anything of note, otherwise the book would’ve ended on page 3. Oh, and he has a total foot fetish. I feel like that’s important to note, you know, as a trigger warning for grossness.Still better than “Feminist King” Rhysand and Rowrat.The Other People:Carbon copy rip-offs of her characters from other books. Ruhn is an emo version of Aedion merged with some Azriel. Fury is literally the same as Amren. Juniper is Elain with a personality. Sandriel is Maeve. Danika is EXACTLY Aelin. Is it plagiarism if you’re ripping-off yourself? A question for the philosophers, methinks.The Plot:By far the weakest plot Sarah J. Maas has ever construed and this is the same woman who plotted ACOFAS. It goes like this: Action > Banter for 600 pages, sprinkled with the most boring murder investigation I have ever read > Answer is given to them > Another 50 pages of banter > Revelations > An “action-packed” ending where more than half the cast of characters do nothing.The World:The world-building in this book sucked. I know of two locations: Pangera (an entire fucking continent) and Crescent City. That is all. We never leave Crescent City. Ever. I don’t think we could if we tried.There’s this war going on in the background of the entire novel, between humans and the Vanir. Yes, the Vanir. If that sounded familiar, it’s because it refers to a race of nature gods in Norse mythology. However, SJM liked the sound of that word but didn’t like its meaning, so in this world (also called MIDGARD) the word ‘Vanir’ refers to all different kinds of mythological beings, including angels, fae, werewolves etc. I love stealing words from ancient cultures and disregarding its original meaning so it can work in my shitty high fantasy novel.Anyway, this war is going on because humans are completely oppressed by the Vanir, who see themselves as superior to humans in every way. However, most of the characters are Vanir so the human plight is pretty much pushed to the background except when the half-human Bryce is being sneered at and she gets mad about it. There are literally people dying, Bryce. This war and human oppression get less screen-time than Bryce’s perfect ass. How can I take this war seriously and believe the Vanir are meant to be the bad guys when we spend so much of the book talking about how sexy they are??Lastly, the writing:I don’t wanna be too mean here because I did read an ARC, but holy shit this is most badly edited ARC I have ever read. I’m thinking her editors are just becoming so lazy because they’re like “ah whatever it’s SJM, they’ll buy it no matter what, leave all the typos in there, take out no scenes, just let her do whatever.”This book should have been edited down to 500 pages and that’s THAT.Overall:If you loved her other work, particularly the ACOTAR series, you will no doubt love this, it has lots of the same shit in it. If you’re going into this hoping her foray into adult fantasy will result in intricate world-building, morally grey characters and adult themes, you would be wrong.This book is basically ACOTAR but now she can swear!! Hooray!2/5 stars thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Reread 2022:I still stand behind my rating & review.Now it’s finally time to dive into book two.""Light it up, bitch.""Did I cry? TwiceIs this my favorite SJM book? NoDo I need the next book? ImmediatelyI haveA LOTof feelings on the first book in theCrescent Cityseries so I\'m going to do us all a favor and just get straight into all the things I liked and didn\'t like about this!What I Liked👯\u200d♀️The emphasis of friendship.Y\'all mind if I scream for a sec? I didn\'t read the synopsis before I picked up this book and the last time I read it was months ago, so imagine my surprise when I finished part one of this book. I was pretty gutted to say the least. Now, after finishing it and realizing the full extent of Bryce and Danika\'s friendship, how much they loved each other, and the lengths they would go to save each other literally makes me want to bawl my eyes out (especially when we find out the significance of some of the things they say to one another). By the end of this book I was reduced to a blubbering mess of tears. Pass the tissues, please.💁🏻\u200d♀️\xa0Bryce Mother F\'ing Quinlan.I love that bitch even when she is a bitch. I\'m not trying to jump the gun or anything here but sheMAYbe my favorite female MC we\'ve had so far. She\'s a curvy, red-headed, sassy, cursing up a storm, take no shit type of gal and we love to see it. I adored how unapologetic she is for being herself, how fierce and hard she loves people, and how much she cares for the greater good as well. Her character growth in this was phenomenal and heart breaking and I need the next book immediately because I need more time with Bryce in my life.🤬Cursing and sex talk.If you want my honest opinion SJM writing adult book feels so right and if she never went back to YA books I wouldn\'t care. I think the way cursing, talking about sex, drugs, partying, and drinking is brought up in this book is pretty realistic to the society we live in today. And I think that this made the book feel a tad more""normal"",you know, as normal as we can get when we\'re talking about witches, wolves, vampires, fae, mermaids, and life vest wearing/mail delivering otters.🌎Urban fantasy world.I really don\'t read enough of them but when I do I always love them. There\'s just something about all these paranormal creatures in a modern/futuristic world with technology and what not that fills my heart with glee. And Sarah builds this world up just like her others. She did a really great job of creating a complex world...even if it did take a little while to catch on. Once I was able to catch up it really did make me appreciate how well it was all put together and I definitely can\'t wait to see more of it.💘Romance.Can we just talk a second to appreciate howSOFTHunt Athalar really is? Because I could cry thinking about it. I loved how this took a friends to lovers approach and that within the time of Bryce and Hunt becoming friends and developing feelings for one another there was a whole lot of healing going on too. I am praying to all the gods that they are endgame and will legitimately riot if they are not.What I Didn\'t Like🙃I am confusion.This book just started name dropping people and places left and right like it was nothing. SJM honey, please let me catch up I\'m trying to figure out who is who, what planet we\'re on, and what in the hell CBD stands for. Eventually I got it but it\'s just one of those cases where you have to just power through and hope for the best that it will all make sense.😴Too long.It\'s a good thing that I enjoy SJM\'s writing because man, was this long. I tried not to let it bother me that much but the fact that you have to sit through just about 500 pages before any""big""revelations start to pop up was rather annoying. For readers who don\'t like her writing this could definitely be the thing that makes or breaks you. Looking back on it I just feel like so much of the first 500 pages could have been condensed and it pretty much would have read the same way.☠️My favorite character died.I don\'t think I really need to say anymore than that. But I amDEVASTATEDand honestly ready to sue.♻️Not the most original.I told myself going into this that I was specifically not going to compare this to the ACOTAR and TOG series. Since it\'s a brand new series I wanted to give it my undivided attention and not look for similarities, but it wasSO HARD. A lot of this felt like Sarah took the best parts of ACOTAR and TOG, mashed them together, changed the time period/setting to a more futuristic one, and added more paranormal creatures. And while I loved this world she created it always felt like this was something I had read before. I mean, there were even similar phrases used in this with just a few words changed from her other books.And there you have it friends, my complete list of thoughts onHouse of Earth and Blood. I am definitely excited to continue this series and despite the 3.5 rating I still really did enjoy this. I\'m not stressing too much over this not being my favorite SJM book because her sequels are usually theBOMBand you best believe I\'m anxiously awaiting the next installment for these characters!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5/5 ⭐Full review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolf🐺“Let someone in, give them the power to hurt you, and they’d do exactly that, in the end.”When I saw 800+ pages I got a bit scared.Okay, a bit more.But then......I LITERALLY HALTED ABSOLUTELY FUCKING EVERYTHING TO READ THIS BOOK AND I DON’T REGRET A THING.It’s beenamazing.AMAZING.At this point in life, I don’t even want to question this woman’s books anymore.Every time I buy a new, fancy wig in order to look decent while reading one of SJM’s books, she snatches it into cosmic space like it’s nothing.I always think I’ve got it well glued to my scalp but oh well. I’m always terribly wrong.Literary goddesses don’t give flying shits about glue anyway.Theworld-building, as usual, is fabulous. I really love the fact that this world has been fashioned in an urban fantasy style because with this, the whole multiverse Sarah J. Maas is creating (like the goddess of life that she is) gets even more credibility and depth.Now, as a bit of a warning, this book gets full-on New Adult, bad words and all so if you feel offended by this kind of thing then I don’t know what to tell you, deal with it or suck it up. I, for instance, have no problem with this (I’m Romanian, we’re nasty creatures) and it definitely didn’t ruin anything for me. Au contraire, it added flair.At first, the characters of this book don’t seem to be the most lovable. I was actually kind of okay with them until I learned to love and appreciate them, but I think that is because they are new characters in a new world and it gets a bit more time to get adjusted to everything. I wasn’t very fond of most of the characters in the first books ofThrone of GlassandACOTARseries either so that’s definitely not an issue. It’s normal.After some time passes and I got used to the story, I started to realise that under all that notorious party girl exterior Bryce tries to put like a charm around her, she is a broken soul who’s trying to get through life – life made hard by those who try to tear her down; she’s a braveheart who loves too much; she’s compassionate and smart; she’s a bad bitch. And Danika is her equal bad bitch bestie and I kind of love them both.“It’s easier for me – when people assume the worst about what I am. It lets me see who they really are.”Hunt is a bit of a stiff-ass but he gets better as the story moves on. Still not head-over-heels in love with his character but he’s definitely a good lad. He’s as broken and lonely as Bryce and this is what makes them fall in love so fiercely and deeply. They feel right for each other. They feel like home.“You are where I want to end up. A life – with you. You are my fucking path.”Also, I actually can’t help but love Ruhn, with all of his frat-boy-dude-bro type of attitude he has at the beginning. Yeah, Ruhn’s the one I truly liked from the beginning. He’s such a goof at heart, I can feel it.Now, we have to talk about this too, a kind-of warning matter like the bad words thingy – even though there are some serious matters going around the Crescent City, this book is very sexy. Sexy for real. And some sexy things also happen *oopsie*.Just harness your horses, please.SJM already mastered this skill of mixing business with pleasure in her books so be prepared to feel a bit uncomfortable at the smut but get fast over it because people die and demons roam free in that world. And there are some juicy secrets teasing us too so you won’t have time to catch your breath.Blush a bit, go wash your eyes and get over it. This book means business.Because you’ll see after you pick it up, the last 200 pages are THE SHIT. I honestly cried at least three times and I wasn’t feeling very myself by the end of it.You know a book gets to you when you broke down crying, so guess what? Brace yourselves, this book wants to catch you off guard.So, with all that being said, GO READ THIS BOOK. And find yourselves a new obsession in it.

Please note that I AM actually a big SJM fan, which is why I took this book\'s existence so personally.Alright, alright, alright:1. The minor characters.I was much more interested when Bryce and Hunt interacted with anyone OTHER than each other. Can I name any of those minor characters? Sure can\'t because either a) I finished this over a week ago and already forgot their names and/or b) their names are weird AF, which made it too difficult for me to remember them in the first place. I particularly liked Faerie brother & co., cat demon, badass boss bitch, and mermaid dude.2. Danika\'s hair.Ice blonde with rainbow highlights is pretty bitchin\'. (I\'m grasping at straws here.)It\'s a no from me, dawg:1. The 3rd person omniscient POV is done SO POORLY.I\'m honestly at a loss on this. ToG is told from the same POV and SJM does a fine job with it (could I USE any more acronyms?).Seriously. SJM knows how to do it. SHE KNOWS HOW TO WRITE (don\'t @me, haters). SO, WHAT WENT WRONG HERE?! She left absolutely NOTHING up to the imagination. There was no mystery or tension between the characters. We’d read a scene from Bryce’s POV where Hunt was unusually quiet. Then, it would switch to Hunt\'s POV where he would spend the first few paragraphs recapping the exact scene we just read with Bryce AND he would explain every single thought he had while he was silent during that conversation. THERE WAS ZERO ROOM FOR INTERPRETATION. There was certainly no need for me to turn on my brain. She spoon feeds it all to you.2. The spoon is actually a giant shovel used for slinging info dumps at you.You\'re told basically the entire history of this world for 150 pages with a little bit of dialogue/one grain of plot rice sprinkled in during it. Do I look like a give a flying flapjack who ruled this place 400 years ago and how they weren\'t that popular and who took over for them and what color shoes that person wore and how long they went between haircuts? SURE DON\'T. Tell me when it\'s relevant. But actually, don\'t TELL me this information...3. SHOW IT TO ME.It\'s Creative Writing 101. You need me to know about the current dictator\'s entire family tree as well as each of their favorite colors? SHOW me why it\'s relevant WHEN it\'s relevant. Don’t hit me in the face with a textbook. Also, make sure it’s actually relevant. 95% of the info dumps were not. NEAT.4. There was no sex scene.In fact, there was very little spice at all. I’m not reading SJM just for plot, SO WHAT THE HELL.5. Everything is SO contrived.I can’t even go into this without giving away spoilers. But, you’ll know it when you see it. Over and over.6. So much gratuitous cursing.Look, I\'m not some delicate flower who faints at any and all four letter words (see: this review).But, reading this book felt just like watching a Scorsese movie. Did they really need to say ""fuck"" every other word? FUCK* NO THEY DIDN\'T. It served no purpose.*my purpose = rage7. Bryce quit dancing because she was told her boobs and ass were too big.OKAY, BRYCE. Could not stop rolling my eyes at this detail.Am I going to read the next book in the series?NO.Is the previous answer a lie?Probably.But, Lindsey, if you hated this so much, why didn\'t you give it 1 star?Bias.

I can see it getting confusing, but I relished in the way the world was introduced and the way she kept building upon it. It was epic!The main characters were just as good as the side characters. There was depth to them all. The murder mystery element was a damn treat and I need the sequels to be following some sort of similar story line. The mystery was intense, exciting, and had my mind reeling! I became a damn detective whilst reading!My slight qualm was with the ending though. The last two-hundred pages are a fuckin whirlwind and at first, I could not believe the constant revelations we were getting. It was so fuckin good and SO well done! Everything, every plot point, was tied up nicely and linked. It all made sense. But as I read on, I found that it dragged a bit too? And that certain things felt convenient? Some aspects of the magic weren't fully explored, which is a pet-peeve of mine. So I do think it could have been slightly shorter and more cohesive.This also read like a complete book. So I'm intrigued to see what the other books will be like, which characters it'll follow and what the story-line will be.But all in all, always sign me up for more Sarah J. Maas.And Hunt, where you at?---------------------------Pre-reading raves!LOOOOOOOK AT THIS COVER!!!!I cry. 😭😭😭😭Best SJM cover. Thedetail!😍---------------------------Well, this news just made my day!

It took soooooo long to get going, which I knew going in. Everyone talks about how the beginning is a lot of world building and is super boring but it's worth it in the end! Well, I don't think it was entirely worth it. Maybe it's because I have a pet peeve about books or series that you have to wait until a certain point for it to get good because I don't want to waste my time. Especially in this case I'm extra bitter because this book is 800 freaking pages long and doesn't start to get reaaally interesting until like page 500 if I'm being generous. But yeah, that's my little rant. The story itself was intriguing and had a lot of twists and turns but they all kind of happened close together. There was an angsty romance that took a lot longer to get going than I expected. It was super duper slow burn so even as the world is building it wasn't like there was much of a romance to latch onto to be interested in. I liked the additions of wolves and angels and other such creatures added to this new fae world. The world is cool because it's an urban modern-ish setting, like our world but not, with these creatures added. The characters were good, nothing spectacular, kind of frustrating at times. I feel like SJM has a very specific character she writes and I don't know if it's just me but I think all of her protagonists kind of seem similar to me. They're like the tough outside soft inside girls, I don't know. I think I might pick up the sequel but honestly, not committing to anything at this point. We'll see how much the supposedly urgent plot is dragged out in that one. I know this makes it seem like I hated it but I didn't, it was a solid middle of the road for me.

This book was great in so many different ways that I’m having a really tough time to sort my thoughts and feelings. What I can definitely tell you is that this book is one of the slower ones. It has 803 pages and up to page 500 every single one of them is used to build up the plot and to introduce all the characters. I know a lot of other people who reviewed“House of Earth and Blood”actually didn’t like this long build up and saw it as a huge flaw but personally I think that it was important for the storyline.Are 500 pages to introduce the characters and the world setting too long? Maybe. But in this book it worked for me. I guess everyone who ever read high fantasy knows that plenty of pages go into the history of the MCs and the world building. (Quite honestly sometimes you’d even get pages of descriptions of the surroundings. I’m looking at you LOTR!!! *lol*) Every info I got in HOEAB was interesting and important for the plot though so I’m definitely not complaining. ;-)Even the least important characters and side-characters had history and I was living and breathing for it. Sure, there are some characters like Tharion, Aidas and Queen Hypaxia I’d love to hear more about (and I’m sure I will in the next book) but considering the many different groups and the complexity of the world Sarah actually did a great job. This said the last 300 pages just about killed me and I couldn’t have stopped reading even if my life would have depended on it. *lol* Yes, it was THAT suspenseful. Quite honestly I have no idea how Sarah wants to top this book!!?? I mean this was book one in a series and my expectations for book two are so high they are scratching the sky. XD Before I think about the next book let’s speak about this one first, okay?! ;-PThe characters:Welcome to Crescent City! The city of many possibilities and ALL the spoilers! *lol* So if you don’t want to be spoiled and haven’t read the book yet, I’d recommend to take the next bus out of town because this is going to be a spoiler festival! ;-)Bryce Quinlan:“Do you own any weapons?” The purely male gleam in his eye told her that he assumed she didn’t.“Bother me again,” she said sweetly, just before she shut the window in his face, “and you’ll find out.”I love Bryce so freaking much, I can’t even! This girl is the BEST! I love as good as everything about her and her many flaws only made her even more likable in my eyes! This is a character I could totally relate to and she felt very real! I mean she’s stubborn, clever, resilient, funny, loyal and compassionate. Yes, at times she’s even reckless but it’s all just limited to pushing her boundaries. She never really goes overboard unlike some of Sarah’s other characters and that was really refreshing. Bryce is a very self-confident character and knows exactly what she wants and she’s not only working hard but also has both feet on the ground. The way she dealt with Micah?! OMG!!! That’s a fierce woman right there! *lol* I respect her character and I hope we’ll get to see even more of it in the next book!”It’s easier for me – when people assume the worst about what I am. It lets me see who they really are.”Hunt Athalar:”In the harsh bathroom firstlights, his light brown skin was pallid under the black band of thorns across his brow. The tattoo, he’d learned to live with. But he shrank from the look in his dark eyes. Glazed. Empty. Like staring into Hel.”I kinda liked his nickname. Umbra Mortis definitely has some ring to it. *lol* This said I also think in many ways Hunt was the broken, powerful “alphahole” Sarah J. Maas has written about so often. Just like with Rowan and Rhysand his background story is heavy and quite violent which was no surprise because obviously Sarah likes to write about men with baggage. ;-P Of course I still liked him and rooted for his character he just reminded me a lot of all the other men Sarah wrote about. What I certainly didn’t expect was his betrayal and the fact that he knew about the drugs all along! This came as such a surprise and his involvement totally threw me. XD Then again it probably shouldn’t have surprised me. After all he didn’t regret any of his actions and said so multiple times. I wonder where Sarah will go with his character in future.”By the time Ramuel decided to let me serve as his assassin, it had been nine years since I’d seen sunlight. Since I’d heard the wind or smelled the rain. Since I’d seen grass, or a river, or a mountain. Since I’d flown.””There were some of the Fallen who accepted the halo and slave tattoo, you know. After a few decades, they accepted it. Stopped fighting it.”“Why have you never stopped?”“Because we were right then, and we’re still right now. Shahar was only the spear point. I followed her blindly into a battle we could never have won, but I believed in what she stood for.”Danika Fendry:”It was unheard of, for a shifter to have that sort of power, yet all the standard childhood tests had confirmed it: once Danika Dropped, she’d become a considerable power among the wolves, the likes of which had not been seen since the elder days across the sea.”If I’m completely honest I probably would have married Danika before dating Bryce! *lol* I loved her character so much and I really wish there would have been even more of her. I mean I already knew Danika was going to die, but I wasn’t prepared of how fast I’d grow fond of her and her pack! She was such an amazing person and her death was horrible. >_< At least as horrible as her own mother! I swear, Sabine certainly didn’t make it easy to like her. If there is even the slightest possibility that Danika gets reborn and reappears in the next book I’d be so here for it. XD Is it possible, Sarah? Please! *makes huge puppy eyes*”Her goal was to protect you. Always. Even from yourself.”Sandriel:”She and the commander of her triarii, Pollux, take cruelty and punishment to new levels.” He clenched his jaw, shaking off the blood-soaked memories. “They’re not stories to tell on a busy street.” Or at all.”That angel most definitely was no angel at all and should have burned in Hel. I hated Sandriel with a fierce passion and I really wish she would have died in the rebellion! It’s not right that a cruel person like her was that powerful and even though she got what she deserved I still think that her death was too quick. She should have gone to prison for eternity and not died that quickly. >_< Well, she’s dead now and won’t cause any more trouble. XDTharion, Queen Hypaxia & Aidas:Aidas had nearly vanished into nothing when he added, the words a ghost slithering through the room, “The Oracle did not see. But I did.”Okay, those three were just side characters but each one of them was super intriguing and I would have loved to get more of their background story!!! Like seriously! Just give me more! Aidas the Prince of the Chasm was one hell of an interesting character and Tharion as well as Queen Hypaxia easily won me over as well. I always knew that med witch was suspicious but I didn’t even think about the possibility that she might be Ruhn’s betrothed. *lol* Let’s hope all of them will be a part of the next book! <3“I know the costs of war, Governor.” Bold male, to say that, to look Sandriel dead in the eye.The relationships & ships:Bryce & Hunt:”Only sorrow lay here. And something like understanding. Like she saw him, as he’d seen her in that shooting gallery, marked every broken shard and didn’t mind the jagged bits. Under the table, the toe of her high hell brushed against his boot. A little confirmation that yes – she saw his guilt, the pain, and she wouldn’t shy from it.”What I really loved about their relationship is that it grew steadily. There was no insta-love or some unnecessary drama. They started out as two strangers that both knew about the other’s reputation and didn’t trust each other. The more they got to know each other and the more time they spent together, the more they started to see the true person behind all their bravado though. It was so refreshing to see them develop a really close friendship. Sure, there was attraction but it was just a part of their friendship and didn’t define it. I adored how they started to take pictures of each other to make new memories and how just to be around each other helped them to deal with their problems. They both had a lot on their plate but together they managed to pull through it. I still can’t believe that Hunt was in on the dugs though. That was quite a shocker and I’m kind of worried Sarah will pull a typical Maas and make us dislike Hunt in the next book. So far all her books started out with a love interest the MC would die for and then she ended up with someone completely different. *lol* It would be such a shame if that happened in here too. I guess only time will tell. XD”And she tried not to look too shocked when he laid his head on her thigh, his arm coming across her to rest on the pillow. A child laying his head on his mother’s lap. A friend looking for any sort of reassuring contact to remind him that he was a living being. A good person, no matter what they made him do.””You’re my friend. Who watches trashy TV with me and puts up with my shit. You’re the person I don’t need to explain myself to – not when it matters. You see everything I am, and you don’t run away from it.”He smiled at her, let it convey everything that glowed inside him at her words. “I like that.”Bryce & Ruhn:”He’d wounded her, and it had scared the Hel out of her that he held such power. That she had wanted so many things from him, imagined so many things with her brother – adventures and holidays and ordinary moments – and he had the ability to rip it all away.”Ahhh I absolutely loved this sibling bond! I mean yes, at the beginning of the book Bryce is keeping her distance to Ruhn and doesn’t want to have to do anything with him, but to be honest the reason for that was pretty shady if you ask me. I mean yes, they had a fight, but it’s no reason to avoid your brother for years. XD The explanation why she brushed him off was pretty lame but then again there are siblings in real life that don’t talk with each other for ages because of one silly thing. Believe me I’ve seen it – siblings that didn’t talk to each other for 30 years because of some minor matter and died without reconciling – so I suppose it might be realistic after all. I’m just glad Ruhn and Bryce are talking again and I definitely want to find out more about Ruhn in the next book. He was just a small part in here and I’m very curious about him and his life. Also I really thought Ruhn might be bi or pan but then Queen Hypaxia appeared and I guess that’s it. >_< I’m pretty certain my queer ass won’t see a real LGBTQ+ pairing in this series as well. Which is a shame but then again it’s probably better if Sarah doesn’t write them. I mean not every straight author can pull off a realistic queer rep so I respect her for steering clear of it. It takes guts to say “no” and to know your own limits. ;-)”His blue eyes gleamed in the streetlights, dawn still far off. A breeze off the Istros ruffled his black hair. And it was the tears that filled his eyes, the wonder in them, that had Bryce launching forward. Had her throwing her arms around her brother and holding him tightly.Ruhn didn’t hesitate before his arms came around her. He shook so badly that she knew he was crying.”Bryce & Syrinx & Lehabah:”My friends are with me and I am not afraid.”THOSE THREE BROKE MY FREAKING HEART!!!! AHHHH!! I’m still crying for Lehabah!!! This little precious fire sprite!!! I can’t!!! T_T I loved Lehabah so much! She was so fierce and compassionate and had quite an attitude but ahh that only made her even more likeable! I loved that she always called out Bryce on her coldness and unfriendly behaviour and that she was such a gossip. *lol* I can’t believe she died and the scene when she fought to give Bryce those precious seconds had me in tears. I was SOBBING reading that scene!!! SOBBING! T_T I’m still not over it. I guess I’ll never be. Also Syrinx is such a precious creature! <333 I want a Syrinx as well!Bryce sobbed, “I bought you, and now I set you free, Lehabah.”Lehabah’s smile didn’t falter. “I know,” she said. “I peeked in your drawer.”And despite the monster trying to break loose behind them, Bryce chocked on a laugh before she begged, “You are a free person – you do not have to do this. You are free, Lehabah.”Yet Lehabah remained at the foot of the stairs. “Then let the world know that my first act of freedom was to help my friends.”Bryce & Danika:”Bryce patted Danika’s silken head as she passed. Danika nipped her fingers, teeth flashing.Bryce chuckled, entering the narrow kitchen.”The bond between Danika and Bryce was so amazing!!! <333 I’m such a sucker for close friendships and found family and Danika and Bryce were like the embodiment of this trope! They had a friendship you rarely find and I count myself lucky to have the same kind of closeness with my bestie. The tender gestures, cuddling, hugging, all those physical gestures of affection but also the strong mental bond and spiritual closeness, it was all there with Bryce and Danika, which is the reason why I loved them both so much! <333 Ahh how I wish Danika wouldn’t have had to die. But that moment when Danika answered and told Bryce to “light it up”. OMG!!! She made the drop with her, from the other side she still helped Bryce and helped her to make the Drop!!! I can’t! I just can’t!!! Those two are killing me! <333 *weeps in a corner* I really wish Danika wouldn’t have died. T_TShe whispered. “I’m scared.”Danika grabbed her hand again. “That’s the point of it, Bryce. Of life. To live, to love, knowing that it might all vanish tomorrow. It makes everything that much more precious.” She took Bryce’s face in her hands and pressed their brows together.Conclusion:“House of Earth and Blood” was quite something and I loved to read this book! Sarah tackled so many important and interesting topics and she did it in a very sensitive manner. It might have seemed to be a slow paced book up to the 500 pages mark but I think it was necessary to build up the story like that. I have absolutely no idea how Sarah J. Maas wants to top this book but I’m more than just willing to find out! *lol* Let’s hope the wait for “Crescent City 2” won’t be all too long.

I love how confident she is and how she pursues her dream even though people tell her she\'s ""not the right size."" She\'s bold and brave and sassy. She will not tolerate people being stupid. She is hurting inside but covers it up by pretending to be a rude, careless party girl. She\'s selfless and smart, but pretends to be selfish and stupid to judge people\'s characters and to hide her hurt from the world.

If he pulls a Tamlin or a Chaol, I will be upset. I\'m not crazy about him, but the way he and Bryce bonded was exquisite. The best thing about SJM books is how the MC and the final love interest share their traumatic experiences and actually WANT to understand each other. The way they slowly open up is devastatingly beautiful. And then they help each other grow. Love doesn\'t magically solve their hurt, but it helps them heal.

But then there was another and another and soon enough, I was screaming internally at the pitch of an over-excited baby bird. I love the ending sooo much. Everything came together perfectly.credit: Fernanda FernandezTowards the beginning of the book, I was skeptical about some of the characters. They seemed like copies of characters from Throne of Glass. Hunt is Rowan 2.0. Ruhn is Aedion. Shahar is Lyria. But as the book progressed, they became their own characters, which I was happy about.I would definitely recommendHouse of Earth and Blood,as long as you can tolerate purring Fae.

In honor of Bryce and the fact that unlike SJM\'s previous characters, she can freely curse.Beware.Also, don\'t worry, this has no spoilers. At least, I don\'t think it does. But then again, maybe? Like, low-key, but then again a lot of these things were bound to happen? Idk man read at your own discretionSo, I almost didn\'t read this book.In part, because I had lowkey forgotten that it even existed, and then because even after I cared enough to remember I simply didn\'t care enough to spend hours of my life reading it (this book is 800 fucking pages, mind you).And yet, because I am me, and I have no sense of self-control or common sense, I read it. Like, just now. Like, two minutes ago as I am writing this.And I liked it.\xa0 A lot.And I don\'t know how to feel about it.It\'s no secret that I don\'t particularly like Sarah J. Maas\'s books (sorry not sorry).It\'s no secret that I dislike 95% of her character in ACOTAR (except Cassian and Nesta, cause I\'m obviously trash). It\'s also common knowledge that I think that her books are just atad bitoverrated.But damn it, this book was so good!No, it wasn\'t perfect. Yes, it was really fucking long. But oh my Lord, it was so fucking entertaining!Sarah played dirty in this book and I loved it! I also hated it because it stressed me the eff out. But mostly, I loved it.All the characters were so interesting and cool and I just wanted more of them.Also, I can\'t possibly believe that I\'m typing these words right now but damn it, I loved Hunt, the main male love interest.I don\'t particularly care for the \'males\' in the Throne of Glass series. The males in ACOTAR all piss me off (especially Rhys, whom I cannot stand because he has no flaws or depth or anything that would make him interesting). But Hunt? I loved this dude. I liked him so much I was beginning to wonder if this was, in fact, an SJM novel that I was reading or if I\'d been bamboozled.In fact, I liked this whole book so much more than any other SJM novel I\'ve read. And I, due to my masochistic reading tendencies, have readallof them.I think it was the lack of phrases like ""fae males"" and ""prick"" and ""mate"" and ""vulgar gesture"" (that last one is probably because Bryce can actually say the wordfuckhere), among other annoying and overused things like *shudders, cringes and dies* ""velvet softness/ velvet wrapped steel"". I mean, they do still show up in some places but it was sparingly and so they didn\'t stand out.Sarah also (thank God!) toned down her excessive use of ellipses. There were still more than in the average novel, but far less than in ACOTAR, that\'s for sure. But seriously, why don\'t we discuss the fact that she overuses ellipses more often?Like, you know how they say Dickens was paid per word, I swear SJM is paid per ellipsis...I also loved the fact that SJM lowkey disses the males in her previous books with her description of an ""alphahole"" (an \'alpha asshole\', in case you hadn\'t gotten it).Seriously, she basically, on the lowest of all the keys, described Rhys perfectly and it was hilarious and refreshing to realize that Sarah might actually be self-aware.And for all you Rhys lovers who will argue that he is not an alphahole. I beg to differ. Also, this might be the wrong review for you.But, enough about Rhys, let\'s get back to Hunt, whom I actually liked. He\'s described as a brooding, solitary badass (which I suppose he is), but then he spent most of his days watching tv with Bryce and cooking her dinner and playing with her pet chimera and basically being super domesticated and nice and great. Like, he can still easily kill people, but he was also super chill and surprisingly cool and not annoyingly overpowered like Rhys (in case you hadn\'t noticed, I don\'t like him).Bryce was also so much more likable than I thought she\'d be. I think it\'s because I was expecting her to be like Feyre from ACOTAR (whom I really don\'t like either), but no, Bryce was actually pretty cool too. Unlike Feyre she wasn\'t a Mary Sue who was ridiculously overpowered and could do no wrong.Plus, minor spoiler, but also not really, it \'s very vague and won\'t ruin anything for you:Bryce casually vacuuming the remaining ashes of her enemy after lighting them on fire, is the most savage thing I\'ve ever read and I was grinning like a maniac as I read that.Also, Danika Fendyr is too good for this world. That\'s all there is to say.And Ruhn Danaan. He just needed a hug. I would have gladly given him one.But let\'s acknowledge the elephant in the room and talk about the fact that I gave this book 5 stars.I have never given an SJM book that honor, and I didn\'t think this would be it.For most of what I read, I expected this to be a three, maybe four-star novel. It was good, I was enjoying it but my brain and my heart were still at odds.Then the last quarter of this long-ass book came around and what happened was that essentially, my heart told my brain to shut the fuck up, and my brain, too engrossed in what was happening in the story, decided to obey.This fucking book*almost*made me cry!Yes, that\'s right, my cold little heart actually managed to hurt for these characters and signal to my eyes to water. The tears never actually spilled, but that was mostly because I was in a room with other people during that chapter and I refused to show weakness! Had I been alone, I don\'t doubt my mascara would have run.That\'s when I knew the rating was skewing in the 5-star direction.Then, during the epic, heart racing showdown that was the ending????My eyeballs were glued to the page. I was grinning and cheering and flipping off fictional characters as I read (I was alone in my room at this time so I didn\'t look insane).I was so fucking invested I doubt I blinked the entire time. That whole ending was chaos in the best possible way.Although I have to criticize (as if that\'s not what I\'ve been doing the whole time), the fact that right before the epic climax of this novel, before all the shit hit the fan, and everything that could go wrong, did go wrong, the main villain revealed themselves and then, in the most dramatic and cliche fashion started fucking monologing their evil plan like a damned Disney villain.There\'s a whole chapter of this villain just stating their evil plan and confessing to everything like they knew they were a character in a novel and needed to clearly state in explicit detail what the heck was going on in a way that even the dumbest of us could follow.I rolled my eyes so many times I could barely concentrate on the fact that it was supposed to be a tense scene. I just wanted the villain to open their eyes to their stupidity and shut the fuck up. I just kept thinking of Syndrome the entire time.But alas, arrogant people like to hear themselves talk, I guess.Then, the end, like, the""third to last chapter"", part of the end was a bit cheesy and annoying for me though.After everything that went down, you\'d think that they\'d have things on their mind other than wanting to get it on (like making sure their friends weren\'t all dead) but no, this was an SJM novel after all. We can only expect so much.Also, I just realized I said absolutely nothing about the actual story and plot so, here you go: the worldbuilding was wild and creative and while a confusing at first, it was all really well woven together considering that different types of magic and technology had to be integrated.The story was well written, if a bit long (this damned book is 800 pages long!), but it\'s ok, I\'m not too mad at it. Despite the fact that I lost many hours of sleep because of it.Lastly, Unlike ACOMAF and ACOWAR, this bookactuallyhad a plot, and didn\'t spend hundreds of pages on filler content and gratuitous sex scenes which is, of course, always a bonus in my book. Also, the plot was pretty gosh-darned engaging.So, I applaud you, Sarah. Against all odds, I sincerely applaud you.In the end, this book wasn\'t perfect and even as I write this, my brain whispers to me in question as to whether this really was a five star novel for me and it brings up some seriously valid points to support its claims. But, my heart is still in charge and it tells me that yes, yes it is, so I\'m rolling with it!(Or maybe, I\'m just trying really hard to justify the two days of my life I spent reading this behemoth of a book despite having work to do. Who knows?)I can\'t believe I\'m saying this, but I am super excited for this book\'s sequel. I am also dreading the fact that it\'s probably going to be really fucking long and that fact is already stressing me out.(It just occurred to me that more than being a raving review aboutHouse of Earth and Sky, this is really just a rant of ACOTAR, and I\'m totally ok with that.)Follow Me Here Too:My Blog||Twitter||Bloglovin\'||Instagram||Tumblr||Pinterest'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""The last 200 pages of this book.....I AM DECEASED.Say what you want about SJM, but there's a reason why her books (fuckingFIFTEEN+books) are still super popular and profiting.My head needs to pull my brain together after all that.Twitter|Bookstagram|Youtube|""}, {'rating': None, 'content': 'OHHHH. ¿Nuevo libro de SJM?¿Saben quién lo va a leer? ¡YO!Tal vez (probablemente) me arrepienta, pero no puedo evitarlo, jajajaja, por ahora sigo pensando que voy a leer todo lo que SJM escriba.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""seriously, why is the average rating stuck to 4.54 ?? several days ago i saw 4.54 and it's still the same???YAASS ARGHARGHHHH!

This book made me go through so many emotions. It all hits the reader like a truck. You can feel what the characters are going through. Sarah J Maas did well.The book starts slow and there are certain parts to it which weren't necessary for the reader to know. But I'll say it all ties up well towards the end. It picks up pace and is action packed, especially in last few chapters.The characters need a bit of warming up to. At first I had bit of tough time relating to Bryce but eventually I started to like her. Maybe Maas intended to write her that way. Hunt is dreamy, not perfect but dreamy. Ruhn, Lehabah and of course Danika are absolutely badass supporting characters. The chemistry between Hunt and Bryce was built beautifully. It's noteworthy that all the characters work well together.Tho this book had a lot of swearing and so little smut, that is surprising coming from Maas.Genuinely can't wait for the next book in the series.

Loyalties have been broken and bought, friends have been lost and gained, and those who possess magic find themselves at odds with those who don't.With her heart sworn to the warrior-prince by her side, and her fealty pledged to the people she is determined to save, Aelin will delve into the depths of her power to protect those she loves. But as monsters emerge from the horrors of the past, and dark forces become poised to claim her world, the only chance for salvation will lie in a desperate quest that may mark the end of everything Aelin holds dear.In this breathtaking fifth installment of theNew York Timesbestselling Throne of Glass series, Aelin will have to choose what—and who—to sacrifice if she's to keep the world of Erilea from breaking apart.","[{'rating': 1, 'content': '*Do I need to remind you to be civil? No, I don’t. Good kids.This is the story of how Sarah J. Maas reviewed her own poetics in one of her books.""You will hate any moment of peace or happiness.""(Because rest assured they\'ll use every single one of them to have sex or to seduce someone into having sex, and sometimes not even imminent danger will be enough of a deterrent. Sadly. A massacre or two would have spiced things up.)""Dorian offered a lazy grin in return. “Believe it or not, this ship has an unnatural number of attractive men and women on board. You’ll fit right in. And fit in with the cranky immortals, I suppose.”""(Self-explanatory.)""Fenrys slid in behind them, his attention going right to the witch. No doubt stunned by the beauty, the grace, the blah-blah-blah perfectness of her.""(Evensheacknowledges the thing got way out of her hand.)""It can be our little secret.""The secret being,Maas plagiarized herself. Because, people,I basically re-readA Court of Mist and Fury. And I most certainlydid notneed that.And this isn\'t just a subjective impression: I have proof, and here it is.EoS:“I’m not taking you against a tree the first time.”ACoMaF:“When you lick me,”(whatever that\'s supposed to mean)he said roughly, “I want to be alone -far away from everyone.”EoS:“You are mine,” Rowan breathed, and she felt the claiming in her bones, her soul.ACoMaF:“You’re mine,” he snarled, and hefted me up into his arms.EoS:“Let me,” Rowan growled onto the sea-slick skin between her breasts. “Let me touch you.”ACoMaF:“I want to touch you first,” he said, his voice so guttural I barely recognized it. “Just—let me touch you.” He palmed my breast for emphasis.EoS:""He leaned in, claiming her mouth as he began to move, and they let go entirely.""And,""She dug in her fingers, dragging her nails across his back, claiming him, marking him.""ACoMaF:""He swept in, claiming me, branding me.""But the best has yet to come.Do you remember the mountain thing in AcoMaF?""Rhys roared as he came, slamming in to the hilt. Outside, the mountains trembled, the remaining snow rushing from them in a cascade of glittering white, only to be swallowed up by the waiting night below.""Yes? Great. Well,after Rhys\'s earthquakes and Feyre\'s human light-bulb, now meet Rowan\'s lightning and Aelin fires.""Rowan’s own release barreled through him at the sight of it, lightning joining wind and ice over the water.Aelin held him through it, sending the fire-opal of her magic to twine with his power. On and on, as he spilled himself in her,lightning and flame danced on the sea.The lightning continued to strike, silent and lovely, even after he stilled.""Lightning, you get it? Freakinglightning.What\'s Fae\'s problem with sex? It seems they are unable to climax decently without getting dangerously close to unleashing some cataclysm on the population that do not share such sexual prowess. And someone care to explainhow on earth can lightning be lovely?Majestic, yes, stunning, yes, but lovely? It\'s not a summer breeze you\'re talking about, sweetie. It\'s freaking lightning. The kind of thing that could kill you in less than a split second, you know.(Oh, why do I even bother?)As you might have guessed, I could go on and on, but I\'ve already wasted enough of my time. So let\'s just try to put everything down in black and white, as neatly as we can manage.•I used to be able to enjoyMaas\'s writing, but, whether I changed or her style changed, now I can\'t anymore. Itis repetitive and monotonous, and I found many passages-not only the sex scenes-overdramatic and overwritten. Besides, the multiple PoVs on the same event bored me out of my mind -a fifth of the book could just go and nothing relevant would be lost. And I still have to figure out why, in the dialogues, half the questions are deprived of a question mark.•The focus on romance, or I should saysex. Because it\'s not even mere romance anymore-every one of Maas\'s series is turning into downright erotica. It\'s not that I have something against erotica, it would be ridiculous, I simply don\'t see why theThrone of Glassseries took this turn, and I think it ratherdisrespectful to the readersof Maas to change the label (I don\'t care if it didn\'t change officially- this is no thing for ""young adults"") from ya to na in the middle of the series. What if an eleven-year-old started reading book one now, and then, once at the end of book four, were forbidden to go on because the parents knew that this book would traumatize the kid for life?There are very few things I value, in literature as in every other thing in life,as I value coherence.This series shows an increasing lack of it.Moreover,all the fuss everyone makes about Aelin and Rowan being together is insufferable. It\'s like Maas tried and tried with all her forces to celebrate this thing as much as she could. She practically idolized this relationship and wanted her readers to get to idolize it too through all of her idolizing. If this is not twisted and convoluted, then I don\'t know what is. And I should be sick of saying it by now, but Hello,manipulativewriting. I really did not miss you.•And talking about coherence,the characters. Theyall turned in inhumanly handsome and daringly provoking womanizers/vamps. They are all bold, sexy, self-confident and cool. Guess what- after ten characters exactly like that and five books, I grew weary of this shit. Not only that; it was as ifEmpire of Stormswere written by a totally different person from the one who wrote the books up toHeir of Firebut probably related to the one who wroteQueen of Shadows. The characters are completely changed in the way they see the world. And how come the first thought in their minds is one and always one? (If you\'re wondering, yes, that should be sex.)Dorian Havilliard, in particular, is not himself anymore. If there was something I hadn\'t accused Maas of yet it was of usinginsta-loveas a real thing (okay, more or less), and yet I cannot find a better word to describe what happens between him andManon(who, lo and behold, is a queen too.What did I say about Maas plagiarizing herself? What\'s so bad about thinking out of the box for just a single moment?). They meet, she saves him; he\'s beautiful, she\'s beautiful; he heavily hits on her without knowing her in the slightest, she likes it against her better sense, and you know where it is going to end. Andtheir flirting is so ridiculous and forced, I was snorting and gagging and rolling my eyes all at once.As a matter of fact, the whole book made me roll my eyes so much it\'s unreal. My eyeballs tunneled their way up my skull and emerged on the top of my head.•But what makes me mad, whatreallymakes me mad, is thathad the romance and the characterization been not so disgusting and sloppy and cookie-cutter, the book would have been worth something. The plot is good, and I do like the idea of the boatload of villains and kingdoms and the variety of theworld-building, but, as things are, they are only general ideas. This universe is vast and offers a number of scenarios and creatures and artifacts, but it alllacks order, and I\'ve been saying it since my review ofThrone of Glass, and every book after that did nothing but confirm my first impression.The heroes lack a true, deep characterization(remember, all bold all brave all cheeky)and so do the villains. Camaraderie is one of the things that usually have me sold on the spot, but seeing how lame all these characters ultimately are, my enjoyment was always very short-lived. I normally empathize a lot with heroines who are as resourceful and enterprising asAelinis, but shestill acts like a bossy, haughty teenager too proud to keep her companions up to date about her schemes, because what if said schemes fail? Shame on you for even trying, Aelin!Now, honestly, what person in her right mind would riska worldbecause of that?•RegardingMaas\'s handling of diversity, I\'m linking hereKat\'s review, because not only does she say everything I too had to say about this issue, but she does it brilliantly. Plus, I\'m a disgustingly lazy person. So go read Kat\'s review.•Almost needless to say, the ending is unbelievably similar to that ofA Court of Mist and Fury. Seriously,unbelievablysimilar:the fact that they married in secret and are now apart and yearning for a reunion, the heroine\'s sacrifice, the hero\'s desperation. You did that once already, Maas, remember? No? Because I do.•Chaol and Nesrynare completely absent. I just thought the world would want to know.•Oh, and let me put your minds at ease: people still purr, hiss, growl and grunt. Heaven forbid someone should do something as trivial astalk. *shivers*➽I won\'t pretend I hopedEmpire of Stormswould magically resurrect the beautiful story I caught a glimpse of inHeir of Fire(still my favourite book in the series)but Maas exceeded all of my expectations, and not positively. As it always happens to me with her books, I read this one quickly enough and without particular effort, but as every one of us knows, your reading speed is not always a guarantee of the quality of what you are reading. I will finish the series because now there is only one book left, butEmpire of Stormsis more silly and absurd than it should have been--which, all things considered, is probably a good thing, given how much I laughed. (Even though I will never be able to admire lightning again without having some totally inappropriate and unintended thoughts.)PRE-READINGEDIT05/09/2015: So here\'s the million-dollar question: will Aelin heal from her bipolarity or will she keep being a shamefully embarrassing frenzied brat good only at bullying everything that\'s breathing?Who guesses wins a trip to Morath on Abraxos\' back.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I still want to give those 6⭐ so let's suppose I actually did itFull review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolf🐺Kingdoms will collide yeah, yeah, whatever. This is almost the last thing that interests me about this book at this point.GIVE ME THAT BOSS-ASS GIRL POWER I NEED!GIVE ME THOSE SUPERB SISTERHOOD AND BROTHERHOOD AND POSITIVE EMOTIONAL-PACKED SCENES!GIVE ME MORE MANON, ELIDE AND LYSANDRA ACTION BECAUSE THEY ARE FUCKING SUPREME!GIVE ME...Oh, wait, what’s that? Uhm...hello?? Is that GRIEF? And PAIN? And an unnecessary amount of PHYSICAL ACTION? OMG no. Stop it right there. I’m so here for this but stop.Mates, I really want to say this:I feel like I’ve been too emotionally invested in this book only to find out it was cheating on me.This is the exact and immediate feeling I had after finishing it (of course, after I somehow dealt with the pain and agony I’ve been put through by that bloody ending that I didn’t appreciate but made me ugly-cry and also made me re-read the last 50 pages three times because it was so emotional and I am weak).Of course, Aelin is growing and growing and growing, becoming until the end of the book the truest form of the queen she has to be. I loved her development inQueen of Shadowsmore than I loved it here, even though she had some spot-on plans and schemes that had me a bit dazzled. But at the end of the book I really can say that I loved Aelin. She became the better version of herself and that is a wonderful thing. It made me forget every tiny „escapade” she had throughout the 700 pages of the book.„A queen of legends indeed.”Rowan and Aelin truly love each other by now. Rowan proved his love and devotion to her in this book so fiercely that sometimes I felt a beautiful warmth in my heart. But other times...bruh, what’s too much is too much. I understand you love each other but keep it under control. Please. Too much touching and unnecessary details for my liking.Moving on.I love the independence Lysandra gets to have. And I love the faith she has in Aelin’s plan. She’s becoming better and better, trying to find out who she truly is and prove to everyone (including herself) that she is more than a pretty face. Even though Aedion is being a regular douche with everyone, including her, he actually manifests a soft spot for her and wants to grant her the world, even though he doesn’t know how to do it or when. And I think that’s sweet.Whom I really come to love in this book (truly) is Elide. She is such a sweet and witty thing, I love her and the enormous heart of hers. She’s proving her skills in this book, outsmarting everyone and taming the feral and lonely beast that Lorcan is. She’s truly a goddess, able to bring him to his knees and making him understand that he’s not alone. He becomes the planet in her gravitational system. And, again, that is sweet.Now, I want to talk about my absolute favourite character of the whole series. She’s my number one, she’s my spirit animal and she can go eat my heart out and I’d thank her for that.MANON.She’s come to realise that she’s more than she was raised to be. She faces an unbearable truth about her and she discovers she’s more important in this big game of war-chess than she’d initially thought. She's getting stripped from her Pawn duties and given the power the Queen has to offer. But she’s alone. She’s hurt. She’s suffering. She’s the persona non grata of the book. And an underdog.Everywhere she goes, she doesn’t fit in. She’s not welcome. She is not getting recognised. She’s not getting listened to. Though she changed. She wants to change. But even so, she really is alone and struggling.„And Manon understood in that moment that there were forces greater than obedience, and discipline and brutality. Understood that she had not been born soulless; she had not been born without a heart.”What really makes my heart melt with joy is the fact that despite all of this, the other underdog of the book, Dorian, is there to ease her loneliness and pain as well as she does for his own.They are my favourites to be completely honest. Even though somehow they seemed a bit stiff around each other at first, their relationship comes to a fluidity until the end. They began as a refuge from each other's storms and now they ended up being the rocks that keep their anchors steady.I really love their energy around each other and I declare them mates now and until the end of time.In conclusion: I want my favourite couple of underdogs to rule the world and give me goose bumps as they do it because I love them. Full stop.Also, I want to take a bit of space here to praise my flower-smelling baby boy, Abraxos, who’s the goodest boy and the smartest and just a marvel in general and he reminds me of Toothless fromHow to Train Your Dragon. They both exude joy, come on now!This is a book that wrecked me as few do. I don’t know how but it got to me and made mesensitive AF. I wanted to cry and I wanted to throw it away and I felt betrayed and sad and powerless at the end. My sadness went deep. I don’t know how...„It was all borrowed time anyway.”""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '“Where do you think you’re going?” Darrow demanded.She looked over her shoulder. “To call in old debts and promises. To raise an army of assassins and thieves and exiles and commoners. To finish what was started long, long ago.”3 1/2 stars. Much better thanHeir of FireandQueen of Shadows, methinks. But maybe not if you\'re unable to skim over thegross love scenes between Aelin and Rowan, or you just can\'t deal with a book whereChaol is completely absent.I have to say, though, I thinkEmpire of Stormsis far better plotted than the third and fourth book. It\'s a whopping 700 pages long and yet it moves much faster than the previous two. It drops us into the action and nastiness pretty much immediately and continues to deliverbloody drama and twistsright up until that EVIL ending.For me,Queen of Shadowswas a 650-page book that contained only about 200 pages of plot development. The rest was filler in which Maas waxed on in melodramatic poetry about how amazing Aelin is and how sexy Rowan is. We get some of that here, of course, but if you can overlook some of the more nauseating moments between the two of them, then it\'s actually a really great, exciting book.Yes, I had to push through all the scenes where Rowan\'s sexiness and uttermaleness(WTF?) is describedYET AGAIN. Yes, his erection is pressing against her perfect, magical ass when we first encounter them in chapter 2. Yes, he is constantly nibbling and nipping at her whenever he sees her. And, like, why is she okay with this?! Seriously, she\'s trying to save her kingdom with every douchebag in the continent on her tail and her bf won\'t control his penis for two bloody seconds! I\'d be like ""Dude, stop effin\' nibbling me!""I clearly just don\'t get this whole Rowan fangirl party everyone else seems to have going on.That being said, there really are so many great things going on in this book. For a start,Manon just got a thousand times more interesting. I longed for any chapter with her in it and I was on the edge of my seat when she does thatvery badawesome thing earlier on in the book. I also, kind of surprisingly, really came to enjoy the chapters with Lorcan and Elide. I must confess it: I ship them. I can\'t help it.If I\'m honest, I think I\'m starting to feel a shift in the way I view this series, which may also have made me enjoy it more. There are those books where we feel a very personal and close connection to one or two characters and their relationships (often true of 1st-person narratives); and there are those that have large casts of characters, each with their own stories, and we care about them all to varying degrees (think epic fantasy series like, say,A Song of Ice and Fire).For me, this series started out as the first. I cared about Celaena and Chaol, and Dorian, but to a lesser extent. I felt close to them; I angsted about them; I really wanted Celaena and Chaol to be together. Now the novels have a wider scope - there\'s Aelin, Chaol and Dorian, but also Rowan, Lysandra, Aedion, Manon, Evangeline, Lorcan, and Elide. Perhaps even Gavriel and Fenrys. FromHeir of Fireonwards, this has become a very different kind of series and I\'m only just starting to accept it. I\'m starting to enjoy the overall plot, the bigger picture, and perhaps loosen my more personal ties to Chaol.I\'m a little sad about it, but I also think Maas and her stories have grown in many ways.More richer, more clever, with lots of interlinking subplots. Something lost, something gained.If you\'ve been clinging to the hope that Maas will go full circle and return this series to how it was in the early installments, it\'s probably time to part ways with these books. But if you\'re just looking for some great storytelling, gruesome action, and lots of interesting characters (and can put up with the insufferable smirking and nibbling that is his royal gorgeousness - Rowan), thenEmpire of Stormshas it all.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube|Store'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Here are my reviews of the previous books in this series:Throne of GlassCrown of MidnightThe Assassin\'s BladeHeir of FireQueen of ShadowsThese two girls said it allSimona’s review,Paige’s video*sigh* I’m not sure where to start. I’ve pretty much loved all the previous books in this series but aghhh this one.Welcome to Empire of Storms, the try not to cringe challenge book edition.➨\tThe first thing that you notice while reading Empire of Storms is the similarities it has withACOMAF. I think that in trying to release two HUGE books a year SJM doesn’t really have enough time to properly edit her books anymore. The two books ended up sounding exactly the same, except for the fact that ACOMAF was much, much better.➨\tThe sex scenes situation: I have nothing against steamy scenes in YA books. I believe it makes the book more realistic and we all love seeing our OTP finally getting down to business.However, what I don’t like is seeing a YA book turn into straight uperotica.There’s a scenes that combines my first two complaints about this book. Brace yourselves.Remember the mountain situation is ACOMAF?""Rhys roared as he came, slamming in to the hilt. Outside, the mountains trembled, the remaining snow rushing from them in a cascade of glittering white, only to be swallowed up by the waiting night below.""Well, if Rhys can make a mountain tremble imagine what good ol’ Rowan could do.""Rowan’s own release barreled through him at the sight of it, lightning joining wind and ice over the water.Aelin held him through it, sending the fire-opal of her magic to twine with his power. On and on, as he spilled himself in her, lightning and flame danced on the sea.The lightning continued to strike, silent and lovely, even after he stilled.""Are you cringing yet ? Alright, moving on.➨\tI’m so done with Aelin trying to be sassy all the freaking time and bossing people around. Oh, and is it normal that she doesn’t share any of her plans with ANYONE?➨\tThis book has no diversity whatsoever. Every single main character is straight and white af. SJM has like 50 pov characters between her two series, you’d think some of them would be a little different, right? Right? Wrong.Also, every single character is blindingly beautiful.Oh and let’s not forget that most characters are royalty for some reason.You’re a queen and you a king ! Let’s throw a prince in there and another king and another queen.Aww my gaawwd !➨\tChaol who?Remember that main character we were in love with for three books?Nop? Okay.➨\tCharacters acting out of character: Dorian felt really off in this book. He didn’t sound like Dorian just like Chaol didn’t sound like Chaol in the previous book but we already got rid of that problem, didn\'t we?➨\tMust every single character be in a relationship?I’m seriously not feeling Manon and Dorian’s relationship. I had a feeling she was gay. I don’t know maybe it’s just me.➨\tFor some reason the narrative is mostly third person limited but we randomly jump into other people’s minds here and there.Ps: Thanks for everyone who pointed out that Aedion is actually bi-sexual I didn\'t omit this fact on purpose. It just slipped my mind when I was writing the review.I hope I didn’t forget anything. Anyway, before you bite my head off, I just want to say that I do love SJM’s writing and I think the plot of this book and the series as a whole is great.

Initially, I was dreading this sequel because there was just so much that could go completely wrong, but Sarah J. Maas seriously knows her stuff. She handled the situations she put my favorite witches through with excellence.This review contains*spoilers*.Right from the start, we get to hear from Elena Galathynius, which, finally. She’s one of my favorites from this series and getting to read more about her after all this time was just a truly epic beginning.“Because for Terrasen, for Erilea, Elena would walk into the eternal darkness lurking across the valley to buy them all a chance.”And speaking of incredible females, Ilovethis piece of fanart:SourceKaltain, Sorrel, Asterin, Manon, Elide, Aelin, Lysandra, Nehemia (!!!), Nesryn and Sorscha.Part One: The Fire-Bringerstarts out with Elide Lochan’s pov.We follow her weeks after the events of the last book: Elide\'s on her way north to find her lost queen—and to also find Celaena Sardothien (she does not know yet that her two quests were one and the same) so that Elide might repay the life debt she owed to Kaltain Rompier. Speaking of, Kaltain Rompier at the end ofQOSwas more badass than anybody I\'ve read about before.On her way through the hills in the forest (where Manon Blackbeak and the Thirteen had left her), Elide’s completely ravenous since she doesn\'t know how to hunt or kill.“She wouldn’t last long without food but couldn’t risk venturing into a village with the money Manon had given her, or toward any of the hunters’ fires she’d spotted these past few weeks.No—she had seen enough of the kindness and mercy of men. She would never forget how those guards had leered at her naked body, why her uncle had sold her to Duke Perrington.”The more I read about her, the more I realized how much I liked her character growth, which I truly don’t remember feeling previously but, as the saying goes, absence makes the heart grow fonder.Meanwhile, Aelin Ashryver ‘cloak-and-dagger’ Galathynius and her crew crossed into Terrasen three days ago. And at least another week lay between them and the city—""the once-glorious heart of her kingdom.""For the time being, they\'re all patiently waiting for the meeting Aedion has arranged between the fiery queen and the few lords he trusts.When they arrive at the tavern for the meeting, Aelin has to remind herself to feel grateful for Lord Darrow (her late uncle\'s, Orlon, lover). He had after all sacrificed for her kingdom; he had men and money to offer in the upcoming battle with Erawan.And I was definitely not expecting this, but Lord Darrow was such an interesting addition to this sequel. He gave Rowan and Aelin the reality check they needed i.e. not everyone is crazy in love with you, which, finally.I mean, it was trulyhilariousseeing Aelin get off her high horse after he was done with the shading:“As for why my court and I wished to meet with you today—”“Court?” Lord Darrow raised his silver brows. Then he slowly raked his stare over Lysandra, then Aedion, and finally Rowan. Ren was gaping at them all, something like longing—and dismay—on his face. “This is what you consider a court?”“Obviously, the court will be expanded once we’re in Orynth—”“And for that matter, I do not see how there can even be a court, as you are not yet queen.”She kept her chin high. “I’m not sure I catch your meaning.”Darrow sipped from his tankard of ale. The plunk as he set it down echoed through the room. Beside him, Murtaugh had gone still as death. “Any ruler of Terrasen must be approved by the ruling families of each territory.”This kind of stuff wakes me right up... where were you when I needed you inQueen of Shadows??Oh, and I especially lived for the shade he threw at Rowan:“Oh, yes, we’ve heard of you. What an interesting turn of events, that when our kingdom is weakest and its heir so young, one of Maeve’s most trusted warriors manages to gain a foothold, after so many years of gazing at our kingdom with such longing. Or perhaps the better question is, why serve at Maeve’s feet when you could rule beside Princess Aelin?”I\'ve waited 84 years for this moment to come.But after Darrow\'s done with insulting her court, he informs Aelin that he doesn\'t recognize her right to rule as the rightful Queen of Terrasen. And neither do the Lords Sloane, Ironwood, and Gunnar, who make up the remaining surviving majority of what was once her uncle’s court.This leaves Aelin shocked to her core because after all she went through she remains a princess by blood—but not queen.And, of course, Rowan-rutting-Whitethorn has to intervene because ""I AM THE MAN."" Every time he inserted himself in conversations, I was just like:I mean, did anybody ask for your opinion...ever? Honestly, truly. To quote Rowan himself, how no one has ever cut out your tongue just to shut you up has always been a mystery to me.One of the main goals I was working towards was for him to get killed off or, at the very least, break up with Aelin. That would\'ve been the only time Rowan left me satisfied...And speaking of satisfied, the Ironteeth (including Manon Blackbeak and her Thirteen) were on their way to sack Rifthold before either sides could even blink. Dorian Havilliard would be their target. Dead or alive.But unknown to the others, Manon has her eyes set on a different goal when she comes in at the exact right time to rescue Dorian\'s ass.“He knew her face before he remembered her name.Knew the white hair, like moonlight on water, that spilled over her dark, scalelike armor; knew the burnt-gold eyes.Knew that impossibly beautiful face, full of cold bloodlust and wicked cunning.“Get up,” Manon Blackbeak snarled.”A century of training and instinct had barreled into Manon, so when she comes out her haze she realizes just who she killed to save the boy-king. Beheading one of Iskra’s sentinel was some hardcore shit.“She didn’t have a heartbeat to spare to marvel that Abraxos had not balked at the fight, that he had not yielded. Her warrior-hearted wyvern. She’d give him an extra ration of meat.”Amongst everything, Manon feeling like a proud mother was a definite highlight.But on a more bleak note, Rifthold, the city that had forged and broken and sheltered Aelin, was officially torn down. The walls of the stone castle were bathed in blood.And everything after that had gone to shit.Everything.• Asterin is to die at sunrise as punishment for Manon\'s blood-shedding of a witch.• Rifthold had fallen, its king vanished and the city sacked by witches.• Aelin, now traveling with Aedion and Lysandra for the coast, plans to raise hell and reclaim her rightful throne• We get to see that the war had taken its toll on Dorian, he\'s tired of feeling as a failure to both his city and people.And as a result, Dorian makes his way with Rowan to the Dead Islands to secure an advantageous ally with the Pirate Lord (Rolfe).Also, since we\'re on the topic, when Dorian asked Rowan this next question, it made my blood boil.“The first time you met Aelin, did you know … ?”A snort. “No. Gods, no. We wanted to kill each other.” The amusement flickered. “She was … in a very dark place. We both were. But we led each other out of it. Found a way—together.”What?! You were literally abusing her physicallyandemotionally!! “Dark place” my ass... this stone-cold bastard crawled out of the pits of hell and is here to drag everyone down with him.But circling back to the main plot... one of the mostEPICscenes in this series happens then with the Thirteen. Manon Blackbeak became my absolute favorite after reading just how incredibly cunning and clever and fierce she is.We had last left her with the knowledge that her Second is to be killed at dawn, so I was truly anticipating what would happen but never -NEVER- would I have guessed what actually went down.At the start of this chapter, I was in literal tears for both Asterin and Manon, and some passages felt like they were purposely rubbing salt into my wounds:“Never again would Asterin ride the winds; never again would Asterin soar on the back of her sky-blue mare. Manon’s eyes slid to the wyvern across the aerie—shifting on her two legs, awake when the others were not.As if she could sense her mistress’s doom beckoning with each passing moment.”Tears welted in my eyes after this.“And in the east, slipping over the mountains like molten gold, the sun began to rise.A hundred years she’d had with Asterin. She’d always thought they’d have a hundred more.”By then, I was close to weeping. From both rage and bone-deep fear.... But we were so close to knowing whether Asterin will get executed or not (I even put my hand on the page so as to not accidentally spoil myself). And damn, I\'m still in utter awe.“Hand trembling, Asterin pressed her fingers to her brow and extended them. “Bring our people home, Manon,” she breathed.Manon angled Wind-Cleaver, readying for the strike.The Blackbeak Matron snapped, “Be done with it, Manon.”Manon met Sorrel’s eyes, then Asterin’s. And Manon gave the Thirteen her final order.“Run.”Then Manon Blackbeak whirled and brought Wind-Cleaver down upon her grandmother.”I was too stunned, I literally had to bite down my tongue to hold off a scream. She\'s a force of nature, a warrior equal to none. And best of all, she fucking cares for her Thirteen.The battle that followed truly left me speechless for a long, long while. The knowledge her grandma so viciously (though, with a smile of absolute triumph) imparted upon Manon\'s true heritage was just twist after twist.“You are a Crochan. The last of their royal bloodline with the death of your sister at your own hand. You are a Crochan Queen.”I needed a minute after that... which was impossible to get when Manon decides to jump off the stone ledge of the balcony to escape her grandmother\'s wrath. She rolls off it into the open air where Abraxos, her gentle, warrior-hearted mount, flew.#And that\'s what you missed on Glee.I seriously never thought I\'d say this, butI want the next book to focus more heavily on the witches. All my favorite chapters were the ones where Manon or Elide were the lead. Hence why part two - Fireheart - was my favorite part.I was especially interested to see where Elide and Lorcan would end up. I’m always weak for couples in stories that start out as fake-married/ dating, but I was hesitant with this one because of Lorcan\'s past and loyalty to his blood-sworn queen, Maeve.But, at the start, Lorcan proved himself time and again—he perfectly teamed up with Elide to slay the world and everyone standing in their way. Their togetherness made me the happiest I’d been in awhile. But... they parted ways towards the end, which made my heart break a bit.Though, I\'m still holding on to the promise they made to one another: that no matter what, they\'ll always find each other...Also, I feel like Lorcan\'s character was the perfect way for Maas to hold Rowan accountable for his destructive behavior towards Aelin inHeir of Fire:“Lorcan had trained enough warriors to know when not to push. He’d tortured enough enemies to know when they were one slice or snap away from breaking in ways that would make them useless.So Marion, when her scent had changed, when he’d felt even the strange, otherworldly power hidden in her blood shift to sorrow … worse, to hopelessness…”Lorcan knew when to not push Marion (aka Elide) for more information, he knew when to stop. So according to that, Rowan should and could have known when to not push Aelin further down in Wendlyn, but did he? Nope... and was he held accountable for his abuse? Nope.And since I\'m on a roll about the negatives of this sequel, there\'s one last thing that I simply cannot leave out:She said quietly to Ren, “Thank you—for helping Captain Westfall this spring.”A muscle flickered in Ren’s jaw, but he said, “How does he fare? Aedion mentioned his injuries in his letter.”“Last I heard, he was on his way to the healers in Antica. To the Torre Cesme.”“Good.”I could not believe it when they removed Chaol from this sequel... I\'m still shocked. Does Sarah J. Maas truly hate his character that much???I needed to see how Chaol was faring being away from everyone? How was he feeling? What\'s going on with him and Nesryn? What\'s going on with him and his father? So many question left unanswered... what happened!!! I mean, thetentimes he was mentioned (mainly by Dorian) were such weak attempts at trying to make it sound like he\'s better off being away from his true friends, which,no.“You know,” he said, “sometimes I wish Chaol were here—to help me. And then sometimes I’m glad he’s not, so he wouldn’t be at risk again. I’m glad he’s in Antica with Nesryn.”“And the Queen of Terrasen is your friend?”“There is no one else I’d want guarding my back.” Other than Chaol, but … it was no use even thinking about him, missing him.”So in honor of all that, here\'s a list of the things I want in the last book:• Chaol\'s presence.• More Manon and Elide.• More Lorcan with Elide (this is a necessity for my calm and peace).• Ansel of Briarcliff friending it up with Manon Blackbeak.• More flashbacks featuring my favorite princess, Nehemia. I seriously still have chills from that memory we saw of her, young and strong and wise, speaking and working together with Elena.• Read about Manon\'s journey to find the Crochans.• Have some fucking peace in the finale.But despite its flaws,Empire of Stormshad one of the most epic and enthralling endings that made my heart soar, strain and crash all at once.As you might\'ve guessed, for the majority of this sequel I didn\'t really care for Aelin—until I reached that gods-damned ending she got.“Nameless is my price. To buy them a future, she’d pay it.She’d done as much as she could to set things in motion to ensure that once she was gone, help would still come. It was the only thing she could give them, her last gift to Terrasen. To those she loved with her heart of wildfire.”The Queen of Terrasen had sacrificed so much and here she was willing to do it all over again so as to not bring someone else in harm\'s way. I had so much love and respect in my heart in that moment.And Sarah J. Maas truly knows how to end her books in such a way that, after reading close to 700 pages, I was left wanting more and more.“Aelin Galathynius had raised an army not just to challenge Morath … but to rattle the stars.”Also,this songwas the greatest to listen to.

She can't be human, no, she is a terrible, brilliant and cruel deity that messes with us mortals. For the past 48 hours I've been fighting and bleeding in Erilea. Now, I'm in a daze. Powerful gusts of wind scattered my mind. Bright fire reduced my sanity to cinders. And icicles have pierced my heart. Because this book, becauseEmpire of Storms, wasstunningly, absolutely, mindblowingly, breathtakingly, terrifyingly EPIC.“Aelin Galathynius, Queen of Terrasen, knew the time would soon come to prove just how much she'd bleed for Erilea.”In the fifth instalment of Throne of Glass series, the fire-breathing bitch queen is trying to gather an army in order to defeat the demon king, Erawan, before Erilea will perish to Darkness. But Erawan is not her only concern. The Fae Queen, Mauve, who is after the Wyrdkeys that will gift her with unlimited power, is as dangerous, ruthless and vindictive. Her enemies had decades, centuries, to plot and scheme. Aelin has barely months. With her loyal court by her side, and the heir of a shattered throne, she is calling old debts and promises, assassins and pirates and nobles, while Manon Blackbeak is fighting a different war, a war against her vicious nature and her own kind. And a storm is coming, a great storm that will either cleanse the world or annihilate it.“Aelin Galathynius had raised an army not just to challenge Morath, but to rattle the stars.”The words I'm trying to utter seem poor compared to themagnitudeof this book. It is my favorite in the series so far, the perfect way to set the chessboard before the final stand that will determine the fate of my heroes and their world.Fight sequencesto give you goosebumps,battleshipsto make your heart hammer,monstersand creatures that jumped out of legends to make your jaw drop,secrets and revelationsto break you. Piece by piece. Villains you hate with a loathing passion and heroes that make you laugh and bleed and weep with them. The moments of serenity were rare and precious. The moments of anguish and despair were so many and masterfully crafted that paralyzed you. Fear coiled you liked a poisonous snake, hope helped you breathe until you could not. But you were never laid to rest. Because this wasa song of blood and magiccomposed by a Muse.I am in awe.“He was hers and she was his and they had found each other across centuries of bloodshed and loss, across oceans and kingdoms and war.”Aelin is still my least favoritein this parade of amazing, badass characters. I do feel admiration and sympathy towards her, but her swagger was always provocative, her pride, arrogance and self-righteousness, her tendency to not share her plans and gamble with many lifes irritated me very, very much. And I hated that everyone seemed to worship the ground she stood and let her get away with her tantrums and her hidden agendas like it was no big deal, but when Dorian solved the riddle towards the end he was met with a fist for being reckless.The last chapters though, they were redeeming. Excruciating. They were my undoing.“For Terrasen. For them. For a better world.”What can I say about the rest of the characters? That each of them was flawed and tarnished and I loved them for their weaknesses and their strengths in a way I would have never predicted? That I wept with pride for Dorian,my most precious of them all, who grew up from the carefree prince to the powerful magic-wielder, the cunning ruler that inspired respect even to those who were wary of him? That I loved dark and brooding and savage Lorcan as much as I loved Rowan and Aedion? But besides all theseediblemale characters, the women were a product of dreams and nightmares.A combination of beauty, sensuality and brutality.Andmyqueen is none other thanManon.freaking.Blackbeak.She was a slayer. A monster. She bathed in blood and she relished it. But then she started feeling somethingmore. It was Abraxos, and Asterin, and Elide, that made her show a vulnerable side, that made her seperate right from wrong and fight against injustice, fight against the part of her that was forged in war and gore. And Dorian knew exactly who and what she was. I didn't expect to become suchDorian/Manon trash, but I am. And I also loved theLorcan/Elidestoryline, I looked forward to their chapters and swooned at the way they started falling in love. And let's not forget the slowly blooming romance between Aedion and Lysandra, which gave me all the feels. Same way as Aelin and Rowan.We're talking about a freaking armada. All these couples, with theirsweetandscorchingscenes (because there was a decent amount of smut I thoroughly enjoyed), were definitely one of the reasons that made Empire of Storms so special.“I'd walk into the burning heart of hell itself to find you.”And I would sell my soul to Erawan himself to get the next book in my hands.

The longer you spend with SJM\'s characters, the more it seems like she\'s completely incapable of keeping character\'s consistent or giving them realistic development. Not caring about these characters has a significant impact on one\'s ability to enjoy this book, as so much of it hinges on characters and their relationships with one another.The plot in this was a staggering and derivative mess, on the whole. We spend a lot of time watching people with more knowledge than our protagonist trying to tell her what she needs to do, and her promptly telling them SORRY Y\'ALL, I HAVE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO. The sense of what is and isn\'t a priority in this book is astounding. Of this ~700 page book, I would say the vast majority doesn\'t contribute to the plot. Most of it is romance and sexual tension because clearly all of the characters need to be in relationships or working on it, right?? Of the bits of plot we get, it feels like a mix of a Harry Potter rip off and a copy of her own book,A Court of Mist and Fury. The ending of this book is pretty much the same as ACOMAF.The writing in this is lazy af. I honestly wish SJM wasn\'t contracted to release two books a year because it\'sobviousshe could afford more time to polish these books. We have an unwieldy amount of POV characters in this, and even with ""distinct"" POVs, we bounce between different character\'s thoughts instead of focusing on who we\'re meant to be focused on in each scene. If you\'re going to have multiple POVs with a focus on their individual thoughts, you can\'t randomly go omniscient as you see fit. You can\'t have omniscientandlimited POVs. Pick one.(Also, even if we have an unwieldy amount of POVs... it\'s a little fucked up that one of the main characters isn\'t in this book. Astounding that you can just cut someone out like that.)Once again, as with ACOMAF, I\'m struck by how GODDAMN HETEROSEXUAL THIS BOOK IS. Every character is in a pairing of some sort, and so much of this book is characters thinking about how hot their love interest is... and a lot of times the attraction comes down to proximity. These two characters of the opposite sex are spending time together? Clearly they\'re eventually gonna wanna fuck each other if they spend enough time together. The majority of this book seems to be trying to build romantic and/or sexual tension between characters... some of which feels really off. We have characters that say things that make them sound like they may be asexual drooling over a bead of sweat rolling down a dude\'s ~oily and hairy chest~. We have characters who are straight up misandrists with a love ofwomenhooking up with men. SJM hints that maybe there are characters in her ensemble cast that aren\'t straight, and then reminds us that ALL FEMALES GOTTA HAVE THE D - it\'s a rule of life, don\'t you know?I will say that the LGBT+ rep in this is better than her previous books, but that doesn\'t mean it\'s good representation. I could do a whole video on queer characters in this book. I might. We\'ll see.I don\'t know, man. This book was boring for the most part. I have 18 minutes of footage of me ranting to Snapchat because I had to stop every few pages to rant about this book. It\'s not good, and I\'m now convinced that this series has no hopes of redemption. I was willing to give SJM a chance after the mess that was QOS, but this was no better.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '2.5 out of 10Ревью в моем блоге/This review on my blogLiving A Thousand Lives(please use Chrome/Yandex browser or Android/IOS to see the page; otherwise, spoiler-tags I use to make my post compact may not work)Genre: high-fantasy, NAStuff: fae, witches, dragons, a million kings and queensFail: gross sex, repetitiveness, pathosWOW: the Witches\' politicsPOV: 3rd-person, multiLove-Geometry: noneQuote-Core:""It was all borrowed time anyway.""This review won\'t be long (too little free time), but you can find more of my rant in the reading progress\'s updates and I\'m ready to discuss the details in comments.

So I had no reason, aside from Dorian and Manon\'s ship (not a big deal, I guess), to end up in the minority withEoS.But then I readACOMAF, got suspicious, and...Yes,Empire of StormisACOMAF#2. Which is freaking ridiculous. After 4 books and 5 novellas danced to one tune, we have an utterly different sequel. The characters speak, act, think and move in a new manner (and that\'s not OOC, that\'s something else). Local folks from before wondered about many things, they never consider each other only as sex partners and never gauged body parts of every person they met. Even womanizer-ish Dorian not once thought about Celaena\'s breasts or tried to find wetness in the\'apex of her thighs\'.But now the first thing someone has on his mind after meeting a woman is:""She was delicately built, small enough that he might have thought her barely past her first bleed were it not for the full breasts beneath her close-fitting leathers.""The guy is Lorcan and he has a mission. Is this a way to estimate the strength of an enemy?And even the Bad Guy wants to know whether Aelin sleeps with her Mr. Hawk. \'Cause, that\'s fucking essential.But let\'s start from the start. With thewritingwhich is super repetitive.SJMalways liked to put the same lines in her different works, but now she does it within one goddamn book. How lazy is it? Her characters flirt with similar words, think the same thoughts, do the same deeds. It\'s like Teletubbies. Remember how they liked to repeat the same actions? Or like reading about just one couple only with various faces and names. Or only names, \'cause bodies and faces ofMaas\'s heroes and heroines are very alike. Full mouth, sensual lips, big eyes, straight nose, broad shoulders for men, full breasts for women, long legs, tough muscles, silky hair, silky skin, silky tongues...SJMchanges colors of their features, but even Barbie dolls have more distinctions than these folks. Repetitiveness, lack of variety, what else... ah, yeah, the pathos! Pathos all the way. I was skimming all the long speeches about one\'s fucking awesomeness and missed nothing. Only 100 (if not less) among ~700 pages were actually good and full of important things. What kind of editor doesMaashave?Thecharacters. As I already said, it\'s hard to tell one from another afterSJMsplit her cast into pairs. All the men are brooding and hot, all the women are sexy and bad-ass. I don\'t have any feelings toward these guys. Not angry with Lorcan, not scared for Aelin, not worked up because of Fenrys (unlike Dorian), not sad for Rowan, not anything for anyone.I\'m fed up with all theirbeauty and handsomeness. Really. This book has no person with thin lips or small eyes or acne. Even Perrington transformed into an Apollo. I don\'t say that I love my heroes being ugly and stuff. But the author may not focus readers\' attention on her heroes\' appearance THAT HARD. We\'re all the best of the best for people who love us and vice versa, but we can\'t be like that for everyone, since beauty is very subjective. And still, Maas\'s characters are.Romance.I ship no one. Not anymore.Aelin and Rowan.Boring. At first he doesn\'t want fuck her in unappropriated places, then...""He’d taken her three times on that beach—twice in the sand, then a third out in the warm waters.""Okay, King of Logic. That\'s actually it. He banged her a few times more (against the wall, by the way, Rhys and Feyre\'s fantasy is stolen) and married in the end.Aedion and Lysandra.He promised to marry her and then called her a lying bitch. What Aldrik and Vhalla forgot in this book?Manon and Dorian.“It’d be a shame to lose the most beautiful woman in the world so soon into her immortal, wicked life.”“I am not a woman.”“Witch, woman … as long as the parts that matter are there, what difference does it make?”So they fuck. She lets him atop (\'cause he\'s speshul). The end.Elide and Lorcan.These two had a chemistry-spark but eventually became THE COUPLE. The oneSJMwrites about, pretending to have many ships.Elena and Gavin.They wanted to have sex before the battle, but couldn\'t. Poor things.Maeve and Hot Fae.She rapes them. I don\'t know why she, like Amarantha, has a problem with consensual sex and needs to force somebody into her bed, but... Maybe this is a tradition of all ancient she-Fae? And if Aelin would grow old she\'d start having males against their will too?Chaol and Nesryn.Aren\'t there. But I\'m sure that every night he whispers something like""I want to taste every inch of you""into her ear and she begs him to fill with his proud and honorable seed. (Upd. I was right. Readit).Sex. Yeah, I got thatMaasis eager to make her characters fuck afterA Court of Vomit and Fuck.So I can only imagine how excited she was to writeEoS.So many POVs! So many pairings! So many opportunities to took someone\'s pants off!!! But the sad news is thatSJMstill doesn\'t know how to write a hot scene. And when she tries to be original we have something like that:She slid her hand between them, and when she closed her fingers around him, marveling at the velvet-wrapped steel, Rowan groaned again, pushing into her hand.Thevelvet-wrapped steel! She also calls itthe impressive demandorevery hard inch of him. Where are we? In Bertrice Small\'s books?Oh, and where Feyre\'s vagina glowed and Rhys\'s climax shattered mountains — Aelin set everything afire (and turned sand into glass) and Rowan\'s orgasm caused lightnings (and broke palm-trees).""On and on, as he spilled himself in her, lightning and flame danced on the sea""""The lightning continued to strike, silent and lovely, even after he stilled"".Ridiculous, huh?Manon and Dorian\'s sexlacked elemental special effects, but softness, hardness, and kisses to one and another corner of one\'s mouth (this line was used as many times as \'busybody\' inACOMAF) plus firework-ish releases hadn\'t gone anywhere.I don\'t understand why someone would want to write so detailed sex-scenes if his or her fantasy is very limited and every a-la hot episode is a twin of its predecessor?Theplot... exists and that\'s already more thanACOMAFgave me. But it\'s too Sailor Moon-ish to catch my attention, sorry. The only things I loved were the witches\' politics and the scene with Asterin\'s execution. Everything else... just meh. I also tired of almighty Aelin and her secrets. She has no reason to keep them now, and still, she does for the sake of twits.Maasplayed this card inQoS, so now all the schemes behind allies\' backs grew old and became irritating instead of shocking.Theending. Hello,ACOMAF! Tamlin-Lorcan betrays everyone for a girl by calling for Maeva-Gibern/Amaranta so she could save his chick (FROM FUCKING WHAT?? I mean, his reason to do what he did was a desire to save Elide. But you know what? She wasn\'t in danger. She found her queen, Manon, and old buddies. She was happy! DidMaasthink that everyone would miss that fact after\xa0subsequent events?). Maeva comes and punishes twoFeyre\'s sisterswarriors by releasing them from their oaths aka slavery chains. WHAT A PUNISHMENT GUYS. I think she could make them immortal too (to aggravate her actions, of course), but, alas, they already were. Aelin-Feyre willingly goes with Maeva-Tamling (yeah, Maeve is multinational) to save Elide, \'cause Maeve gave her a choice: she or Elide. Now mind that Aelin has to collect all the keys and die so the world could be cleansed from Erawen and his kin while Elide is a mere girl (but everyone wants to be her friend or mate or comrade and so on). One life or the world\'s fate?One life, decided Aelin, got whipped and went into sunset with a cray-crew. Then Rowan shows up and starts to scream,""Where\'s my wife?"". The case is, our guys married in secret (Aelin knew that Maeve would come and did nothing aside from that because of reasons), and they are mates. AGAIN. I hate mating bond, it diminishes everything the characters had before with other heroes and each other too, \'cause mating means to love by default. I don\'t get whyMaascrosses her own development. Rowan and Aelin were enemies than friends then allies then more and more. And suddenly we find out that their fates were sealed even before they were born. And everyone they loved during their lives was nothing and no one.SJMscrews even the friendship her heroes had with""I wanted you from the start!"". Though she does it with every paring of hers. I shouldn\'t be that surprised.Diversity. I know that many people accusedMaasin ignoring LGBT and POC topics. And yeah, in her previous books we\'ve seen only one woman of color and no gay or lesbian person. Whether the publisher insisted or she herself decided to show \'em all, butEoSis full of queers. And all of them are dead or unimportant and show up only in one or two sentences. Plus the only bi character romances a woman. So what was that?""I have gays and lesbians! Fuck off!""scream? Diversity for the sake of diversity is a mock. If you don\'t feel like developing queer-relationships then stay away from this theme.I wish my rant were longer, but besides the aforementioned things, the book has nothing to dwell on. It\'s all about the desire to have sex, having sex, or frustration because of not having it. Samey flirtations. A million kings, queens, princes, princesses, and high lords. Even Manon\'s a queen now. There\'s war. Somewhere. The fuck I know where. And villains (with lame motivations). But we see them only on 50 pages from ~700, so...All in all,Maas\'s writing is definitely not for me. Will I finish the series? Who knows. If I\'d be in need of a good laugh then yeah, of course.PS: For those who consider Aelin a great mastermind I have a question. How could she know in Rifthold where she\'ll end up at the end of book #5? She can\'t see the future, can she? She couldn\'t send the right coordinates. So her awesome plan with armies is just a freaking deus ex machina. Also, why did she need Manon to step into the mirror if everything was only about her? And why did she nothing despite her knowledge of Meave\'s arrival to prevent the blackmailing? Why didn\'t she say a word to anyone so her pips could ready themselves and come up with a plan? Yeah, I know, for reasons.Throne of Glass (Стеклянный трон):— Assassin\'s Blade (Право на месть) #0.5/6—Throne of Glass (Стеклянный трон)#1/6—Crown of Midnight (Корона полуночи)#2/6—Heir of Fire (Наследница огня)#3/6—Queen of Shadows (Королева теней)#4/6—Empire of Storms (Империя бурь)#5/6— Untitled (Без названия) #6/6'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'best book ever.i need to breathe.can you please message me if you have read thisi need to talk about it'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'rereading this series has been the best decision. i completely forgot how much i loved this book.feelings that stayed the same:- shock and awe that this surpasses‘queen of shadows’in terms of creativity, foresight, and complexity.- i only like manon if she is with other main characters, so everyone finally meeting is a big win for her character.- i miss choal. i know why and im excited to see him again in the next book, but man. only two mentions in 600+ pages is rough.feelings that changed:- i know how the whole series ends now, so i wasnt really bothered that so many things kept going wrong for the characters (especially the ending).- ELIDE AND LORCAN. like, wow. how could i have slept on them my first time reading this?? honestly, they are amazing characters and i cant believe it took a reread to fully appreciate them.- is it just me or is everyone underestimating dorian, myself included?__________________________________i really thought this series was going to peak with‘queen of shadows’because it was so bloody brilliant, but ive never been happier to be proven wrong. the level of planning and cunning in this story and the way it was told is on another level. usually, i prefer it when the reader is fully informed and given more knowledge than the characters, but man. every time a secret plan was revealed, i could not help but admire SJM and her sly writing.also, can we appreciate that all of the different story points have FINALLY converged and everyone was reunited?! i cant tell you how long i have been waiting for that to happen.and if i could air one tiny little grievance, it would be that the whole ‘nothing goes to plan’ occurrence happened wayyyy too often. it kinda got old fast and sometimes made the story very frustrating, in my opinion. but i understand that without opposition, the book would be boring. because holy crap.

I think I\'ve had some time to get it together and am finally ready to right a review for this book.We\'re pretty deep into the Throne of Glass Series so writing reviews for it are getting harder and harder. It\'s getting harder to talk about events going on and where are characters stand without spoiling anything. I\'m go to try my damnedest not to spoil anything! This will also be a shorter probably super listy reviw (is listy a word??). Also, if you\'re reading this review pre-picking upEOSand haven\'t readThe Assassin\'s BladeI would suggest doing so. There are a lot of things and characters brought up in this book that are only inTAB.This series holds such a special place for so many, and I am one of those people. I love everything about this series and where it\'s headed. Can\'t believe this series is almost over.Everything I liked:-Manon. I know everyone and their mom has been a fan of Manon since she first appeared, but I wasn\'t. I didn\'t not like her, but I wasn\'t in love with her. I am now! I was waiting for her POVS and events involving her. And there is a lot of Manon in this book.-Dorian-Rowan Bromance going on. I like all their precious broments. Loved that these two finally got to do some bonding. Dorian is one of the sweetest characters in this series, and Rowan is Bae is I love getting to see these two hang.-Celaena (Aelin)\xa0calling Rolfe “his Pirateness” and wanting Rowan to call her “milady”.-Celaena\'s sarcasm hasn\'t gotten old. If anything it\'s gotten even better.-How Rowan is opening up so much! I love Rowan! I love mysterious, powerful men, and with this book I feel like were actually starting to know the real him... and I can\'t get enough of it.-The Smut!!!! This book is so hot I think it left grill marks on my hands from holding it. The sexy scenes are..... God they are hot!-Seeing Dorian and Aelin referred to as the King of Adarlan and Queen of Terrasen.-The insane amount of world building. It\'s stunning and phenomenal.-Chaol not being in the book. I don\'t think this is a spoiler. However, I think it was a very boold, and smart choice for Maas to do.-The importance of Rowan treating and presenting Celaena as his equal. This makes me want to cry. Like eyes watering typing this because it makes me so happy. ""Rowan Whitethorn saw everything. From the moment he met her, he saw all of Aelin. And he was not afraid. I don’t blame either of them for falling in love. I don’t blame her… I was what Celaena needed after Endovier. But Rowan is who Aelin needs – forever.”-New love interest.-SJM love for girl power.-Epic fight scenes. Including but not limited to sea battles.I want to talk about 992830980293 more things, but I\'ll only talk about one more.-The ending. HOLY SWEET MOTHER OF GOD! WHAT AM I SUPPOSE TO DO WITH THAT ENDING!!! HOW DOES SHE SUSPECT US TO LAST ANOTHER YEAR!!! The ending of this book... it BROKE me! I was gasping for air, I wanted to throw up, and I was sobbing all at the same time. I loved how it brought us back to the first book, while at the same time showing us how far this series has come. Just when I think Celaena can\'t get any stronger, more badass, or make me fall in love with her more she proves me wrong. Everything about this ending was perfect. It\'s everything I wanted. Seriously a sobbing mess! I ended up re-reading the last like 20 chapters a few days later, and still knowing what was going to happen didn\'t stop me from having another complete breakdown.Everything I hated:yeah you read that right. I have no cons for this book. Feel so many people are hating on it because of the hype. People love to hate on things. This series though, is outstanding. Sarah J. Maas never lets down.(Old)Is it bad I\'m hoping one of the main dude dies??? Also I have this gut feeling Sam isn\'t dead and that\'s the ending??? Is it bad that I\'m team C be solo??? Proven queen rule better alone. Just saying *insert sassy girl emoji.**re read updated review*. Ok I still think someone important will die. Know sam is dead, but will never agree to it. Still kind of want her to be solo, but love Rowan so much. I also forgot how much this ending hurt. But how wonderful that pain is.*'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'It\'s just an amazing book. My expectations were sky-high for this book. The Throne of Glass has been one Favourite series in a long time. Every book seemed to get better and better. With these kinds of high hopes, I was just thinking this book would let me down somewhere. The only letdown is that the book is finished, and I can\'t wait for the next one. It not only lived up to my expectations but sapassed them. One thing I will put a note on is that there are a lot more explicit passages both in language and scenes. For example, unlike the other book where SJM would write ""a string of curses sprang from her lips,"" in this one, it is the flat-out curses. I have no problem with this, but be warned for younger readers.So much of this book talks about how powerful Aelin is and can become, but it is also a reminder of how brilliant she is. There are revelations galor. There are twists and turns and return. This story kept me gripped from beginning to end. Just when I thought I had everything figured out, it changed again. Also, every character/member of ""the court"" had a chance to shine.This book just has it all, great characters, great character development, great writing that made me want to just devour chapter after chapter to the point I did not want to put it down during the finale. All this and bucket loads of action. Great continuity in the series, tying together many of the plots lines that were left in not the the other books but the novellas as well. What can I say when a book that is almost 700 pages leaves me wishing for another 700 pages it must be good.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Wow. Just wow.I\'ll be filming a full video review for this so I\'ll keep my thoughts here brief.I didn\'t have high expectations going into this because, as this series has gone on, I\'ve increasingly lost interest in most of the characters and the plot.But this took everything I didn\'t like in the series and multiplied it by 10000 and took everything I loved and shattered it to pieces.For a while, I actually really enjoyed the direction of the plot. It seemed like the world would actually start expanding and some things would start to make sense. However, by the end, things just started to get ridiculous, plot lines were wrapped up in the most convoluted ways possible, and of course there had to be a little ""fate"" added into the mix to render everything else irrelevant.The romance was insufferable and made up at least 70% of the book. It was just a bunch of brooding, ""hot,"" Fae men, standing around being jealous of the other men when they spoke to their girlfriends. Speaking of which, EVERYONE in this book had to be in a relationship (a heterosexual one, of course), because you can\'t have a group of attractive royals in the same room unless they\'re all making out with each other.Like the book did, let\'s just ignore the fact that one of the main characters of the series wasn\'t even in this, and talk about the characters that were. The characters, which had always been my favorite part of the books, were all intolerable. All the male characters are pretty much just carbon copies of one another with different color hair/eyes. They\'re all ""walls of muscle"" who have temperament issues and are way too territorial over the women they\'ve ""claimed."" As for the female characters, they\'re mostly brushed aside to make more room for Aelin and her ego. By the end, Manon is the only one I still truly like, and I bet you I\'ll end up hating her too by the end of the next book.The thing is, this isn\'t the same series as the first two Throne of Glass books. I\'m all for a series progressing, changing, and growing. But when your characters are unrecognizable, when your new plot lines negate almost the entirety of some of your previous books, then there\'s a problem.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '”The world,” Aelin said, “will be saved and remade by the dreamers, Rolfe.”So, it took me ages to start writing this review and truth be told I’m still not sure if I’m ready to do it. This book was the equivalent of a wild roller coaster, just with the minor and rather distinctive difference that there actually was no brake in the end. It felt like an amazing ride up until the moment the brakes failed and the entire waggon tumbled into nothingness!And if you already think that my description is messed up:YOU HAVE NO IDEA!!!*lol* Because to read this book and especially the ending is even worse than any allegory I could come up with!! XDI mean it! I’m stillSO DAMN SHOOKand it will take me ages to recover from that book! Still, I really loved “Empire of Storms” and even though the ending killed me and left my mind reeling and my heart bleeding I probably enjoyed this way too much. Sarah can write and she proved it once again with an amazing book that left me gasping and wanting for more.This time around not everything was sunny and nice though. There were some things I didn’t like because they were idk… just weird. *lol* I mean I get why love played a huge role in EoS and believe me when I say that I loved all the ships that developed throughout the series, in this fifth book some of the relationships seemed to be kind of dissonant though. Or should I rather say the timing for those relationships to develop was sort of improper?!Or to put it even more bluntly: It’s abnormal how much time they spent with making love when the entire world around them is in chaos and war! *lol* Especially Aelin and Rowan. XD Just saying! Haha! You’d think they’d have more important matters on their mind but nope. Apparently horny fae males can do it everywhere. *lol* Ooops, did I just say that?! Young kids under 13 you forget that you ever read this, okay?! *smiles innocently*So where were we? Oh yes, inappropriate timing and love. You all know me and know that I’m a sucker for things like that but this time around it all felt kind of forced. Like Sarah realized that this is the last book she can use to form proper ships and decided to do them all in one go! Don’t get me wrong, I loved those ships and Idrooled overrooted for them with every fibre of my heart. Sometimes I just thought that it was happening way too fast and didn’t fit into the overall plot. That’s just my opinion though so don’t let this keep you from enjoying the book. =) It’s definitely worth reading!!! <333The plot:”Morath is unleashing its horrors,” Lysandra said. “Maeve stirs across the sea. Two goddesses walk hand in hand with Aelin. More than that, Mala and Deanna have watched over her the entirety of her life. But perhaps it wasn’t watching. Perhaps it was … shaping. So they might one day unleash her, too. And I wonder if the gods have weighed the costs of that storm. And deemed the casualties worth it.”The characters:I didn’t do one of my spoilery spoiler sections for quite a while so to all of you who just started to read my reviews: This is the part where I spoil the hell out of the book, everything I write about the characters is uncensored and pretty direct. So if you didn’t read the book and plan to do it: Don’t continue to read my review! This is a fair warning, you better don’t ignore it. I assume no liability. ;-PAelin:”She looked over her shoulder. “To call in old debts and promises. To raise an army of assassins and thieves and exiles and commoners. To finish what was started long, long ago.”OH GOSH!!! AELIN!!!That wonderful, stupid, brilliant and fire breathing bitch!!! I can’t even!! I don’t know where to start! I mean ARGH!!! I hated her so much for some of her actions!! I was angry because she didn’t tell anyone about her plans, because she was so egoistic and ordered them all around! I hated the way she treated Aedion and what she asked Lysandra to do and throughout the entire book I didn’t know whether I wanted to strangle or kiss her! Talk about A LOT of mixed feelings! *lol* But that ending?!! Oh gods! That ending was so heart-breaking! It all made perfect sense, all her scheming, plotting, lying and hiding things. Boy, did it hurt to read those last 50 pages… I don’t even want to know what is going to happen in the last book, it definitely won’t be pleasant for Aeling though. Poor girl, poor, poor, poor girl! *sobs* T_T”I’m sorry,” Aelin said, shoulders curving inward, head dropping low as the tears slid down her flushed cheeks. “I’m so sorry.” How many years had those words been locked up?Rowan:”Even if Maeve had kept me enslaved, I would have fought her. Every day, every hour, every breath.”I definitely liked Rowan in this one! After my slight disappointment of his portrayal in “Queen of Shadows” it seems like he found his way back to being an individual. I guess it might have helped that him and Aelin weren’t always together in Eos and this kind of gave him the opportunity to shine as the fierce fae warrior that he is. XD I’d have hated him to become just an accessory for Aelin because he’s actually a pretty cool character and I know that he can stand his ground. Yes, they love each other but that doesn’t mean he has to lose himself and everything that makes him him. So, yes, I admit it, I’m glad Sarah managed to get her act together. *lol*”Sometimes I wish I knew every thought in that head, each scheme and plot. Then I remember how much it delights me when you reveal it – usually when it’s most likely to make my heart stop dead in my chest.”Aedion:”The fear of loss … it can destroy you as much as the loss itself.”Mhmm… Aedion my precious bisexual Cupcake! *lol* I still love him so much and I still think he deserves the world and this even though he did a lot of stupid things I didn’t agree with! For instance treating Dorian like shit! I mean WTH?! Then again with a person like Aelin whose actions were always like some sort of punch it’s actually no wonder that he was always so grumpy! (Not to mention the thing with his father!!!) He would have deserved her trust and he didn’t get it, so I can’t blame him for being pissed. XD Especially after finding out about Aelin’s plans with Lysandra. Urgh! Still, given some timeand a verbal slap from Lysandrahe always realized his faults and tried to correct them as good as possible! He has the ability to listen to people and I think this is worth a lot! XD (Especially if you know Aelin… *lol*)”He couldn’t explain why, but he wanted her there. She got under his skin so damn easily, but … Lysandra steadied him. Perhaps because she was something new. Something he had not encountered, had not filled with hope and pain and wishes. Not too many of them, at least.”Lysandra:”He was enslaved; he was tortured for months. Not just by his father, but by that thing inside of him. He was violated, and even if you cannot draw up forgiveness for stabbing Aelin against his own will, then try to have some compassion for that.”Lysandra, the voice of reason! <333 I swear sometimes it felt like she was the only level-headed person in Aelin’s entire court! I loved that she talked back to the guys and didn’t even bother to be nice about it. I just love her! She’s one hell of a woman and I swear if she doesn’t accept Aedion at her side I’ll try my luck with her! *lol* (and with Manon but that’s another matter. XD) Lysandra was just amazing in this book and the way she fought? Boy, that woman is brave and fierce! Some of the best fighting scenes were with Lysandra and that’s just awesome! Finally a woman that truly knows how to kick people’s asses! Physically and verbally of course! *lol* <333 Gosh, what a woman! *shakes head and sighs deeply*”I never had friends – not as I do now. And today on that beach, when I saw that fleet and thought it belonged to our enemy … For a moment, I wished I’d never met any of you. Because the thought of any of you …” She sucked in a breath. “How do you do it? How have you learned to enter a battlefield with your Bane and not fall apart with the terror that not all of you might walk off it?”LysandraManon:”Her grandmother’s creature – that’s what Manon was. It had never seemed like a hateful thing.”I am so proud of Manon!!! I can’t even! She finally decided to follow her heart and even though it cost her dearly I’m still so damn happy that she choseHERpath! I always suspected that there was more to her and when I found out that she is the last Crochan Queen my jaw kind of dropped to the floor! OMG! What a mean twist of fate. Poor girl, she was so confused, wounded and alone but she still didn’t give into her despair and I loved her for it! This woman isMADE(figuratively and literally speaking) of iron and I just can’t get enough of her.I LOVE. HER. SO. MUCH!!!<333 #WatchManonAndMeAsWeRideIntoTheSunset, #P.SWe’reTakingDorianWithUsToo ;-P”And Manon understood in that moment that there were forces greater than obedience, and discipline, and brutality. Understood that she had not been born soulless; she had not been born without a heart. For there were both, begging her not to swing that blade.”Dorian:”The man fighting inside his father had kept the blow from being fatal. Dorian had possessed no such control, no such strength, when he watched the demon use his own body – when the demon had tortured and killed and taken what it wanted. Maybe his father had been the stronger man in the end. The better man.”DORIAN!!!I’ll never get tired of loving this man!! Of all the guys that are part of this series he’s still my favourite and number one! Dorian is my precious cinnamon roll and nothing will change that! With every book I just love him more and more and I can’t wait to read “Kingdom of Ashes” because I know he’ll be great! There’s a dangerous and sexy edge to him now and boy, I’m living for it!!! <333 The only thing that worries me is that according to Elena it’s either Aelin or Dorian who has the strength to kill the Valg, because if that means one of them has to die in the end I’m going to be so pissed. Especially if it’s Dorian which is pretty likely since he has the keys now and is trying to finish what Aelin couldn’t. I mean damn! I swear if Dorian dies I’m going to cry for days. T_T He doesn’t deserve to die but Sarah always has her whipping boys (I’m still waiting for a happy end for Lucien!!! Dammit!!!) and I’m so afraid that Dorian will have to die in the end. =((( Please Sarah, don’t do it!!! Please!!! *sobs*#TeamDorian forever and for always”I have seen death, and worse,” he said, those sapphire eyes frozen as he surveyed her from head to armored boot-tip and back again. “The death you’d offer is kind compared to that.”Elide:”Why?” And with all of Lorcan’s considerable focus honed in on her, with the way he’d glanced at her red-painted mouth, Elide wanted to tell him. About the tower, and Vernon, and her parents. About why, if she were to ever feel desire, it’d be a result of trusting someone so much that those horrors faded away, a result of knowing they would fight tooth and claw to keep her free and never lock her up or hurt her or leave her.I finally got more of Elide and I have to say that I enjoyed every second of her POV. She’s such a clever, calculating and cunning woman! (The three C’s I love the most! *lol*) And I loved the moment she acted like Manon and actually managed to get rid of the Ilken! I mean how cool was that? This girl knows how to survive and I couldn’t help but love her for her strength. Still, I’m sorry for everything she had to go through and I really hope that she’ll find peace once the war is over. Deep down inside her she’s really broken and even though she and Lorcan are on bad terms right now I’m still pretty sure that he can give her what she craves the most. *sigh* Poor girl. =(”Storms mean looking for shelter,” she murmured. “Shelter means being stuck inside with nothing to do but gossip. Gossip means news from merchants and sailors about the rest of the land.” Those eyes cut to him, dry humor dancing there. “That is what thunder means.”Erawan & Maeve:Those golden eyes simmered like hot coals. “Because destroying a symbol can break the spirits of men as much as bloodshed.”I HATE THAT EVIL WITCH!!!If I’d have my way, I’d let her rot in hell! Next to Erawan of course! Gosh, I hate those two so much! They are horrible people and despicable and urgh I just want them to vanish! Someone has to stop them and they need to do it fast!! >_<The relationships and ships:Manon & Dorian:She’d forgotten how much taller he was. Face-to-face, Dorian panted as he stared down at her and breathed, “Hello, witchling.”Some ancient, predatory part of her awoke at the half smile. It sat up, cocking its ears toward him. Not a whiff of fear. Interesting. Manon purred back, “Hello, princeling.”THIS SHIP IS MY OTP!!!Forget Aelin and Rowan! Dorian and Manon are the real deal! I love them soo much and I couldn’t get enough of them. Their conversations were so awesome and I loved the fact that they were equal. They treated each other like equals and there were no discussions or arguments! They know what they are capable of and they are so honest it hurts! *lol* Also can we appreciate the tension between those two! GOSH! It almost killed me! They are such a power couple and even though their relationship seems to be more rough than those of the other couples they are still gentle with each other. <333 There is respect, there is love, there is a mutual understanding about who they are!WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR!? I LOVE THIS SHIP AND I’LL GO DOWN WITH IT!Period! <3”Not spared him. Rescued him.He wasn’t a fool. He knew she’d done it for whatever reasons were useful to her. She was so alien to him as the warrior sitting at the other end of the boat – more so. And yet, that darkness, that violence and stark, honest way of looking at the world… There would be no secrets with her. No lies.””You could have made her suffer – you went for a clean blow instead. Why?”“Because even with our enemies, there’s a line.”“Then you have your answer.”“I didn’t ask a question.”Manon snorted. “You’ve had that look in your eyes all night – if you’re becoming a monster like the rest of us. The next time you kill, remind yourself of that line.”Rowan & Dorian:Rowan considered for a moment, and then said,” I have known many kings in my life, Dorian Havilliard. And it was a rare man indeed who asked for help when he needed it, who would put aside pride.”This is legit the best bromance of this entire series! I adore their friendship so much! They understand each other and Rowan knows exactly how Dorian feels! Plus I love that he doesn’t underestimate him and that he trusts him to make the right decisions! And they seem to have similar powers, which is great because Rowan was able to help my precious boy to learn how to control his abilities! <3 I really hope that friendship will last! =)”Rowan knew most underestimated the sharp intelligence under that disarming smile. Knew that Dorian’s value wasn’t his godlike magic, but his mind.”Lysandra & Aedion:Aedion grinned. “Good to know I’m finally getting under your skin. Or is it skins?”That staggeringly beautiful face turned positively wicked. “Careful, Aedion. I bite.”They are definitely my second OTP! *lol* I still love their easy banter and I was so glad that this ship started to sailsomehow! XD And let’s face it: Aedion telling Lysandra that he’s going to marry her was really one hell of an awesome scene! <333 I loved it! Those two can be so peaceful together, it warms my heart. They are both so fierce and loyal but they can be really tender and sweet as well. They are just perfect for each other… *sighs* And they are a slow burning ship which was a really nice change! Still, I want a kiss in “Kingdom of Ash” or even a hot sex scene. *lol* Yes, you read right, I have no doubt that with those two it will be as much fun as with Dorian and Manon! Haha! ;-P”He hated Aelin for asking this of Lysandra, both to defend them and to secure the Mycenians to fight for Terrasen. Hated the people who had left such scars on the shifter that Lysandra was so willing to throw her life away.””The ghost leopard sat beside him, tail twitching, and met his eyes for a moment before she laid her enormous head on his thigh. In silence they watched the stars flicker over the calm waves, Lysandra nuzzling her head against his hip.”Aelin & Rowan:”This was what drove her out of her mind – this fire between them. They could burn the entire world to ashes with it. He was hers and she was his, and they had found each other across centuries of bloodshed and loss, across oceans and kingdoms and war.”Is it just me or were they actually too much in this book? Their relationship became so corny and perfect that it was more than just a little unrealistic. I noticed this in ACOTAR and I’m seeing it here too, it’s just too perfect. They are so perfect together, that they lose their ability to shine as individuals and call me crazy but I really dislike that in books. The love of Aelin and Rowan is just so all-consuming it leaves no room for other things. And it’s come to a point where it’s so kitschy that I almost puked because of the constant sweetness overload. I know many people love them and they are their OTP but seriously, for me they lacked zest. Rowan loves Aelin no matter what she does and that just feels wrong. In a real relationship you argue, you scream and this even though or especially BECAUSE you love each other. ;-) Those two? Nothing. It’s just my opinion though so if you feel differently that’s okay as well. =))”I love you. There is no limit to what I can give you, no time I need. Even when this world is a forgotten whisper of dust between the stars, I will love you.”Elide & Lorcan:”I made a promise to protect you. I will not break it, Elide.”She made to pull away, but he gripped her a little harder, keeping her eyes on him.“I will always find you,” he swore to her. Her throat bobbed. Lorcan whispered, “I promise.”What can I say? I always knew they’d become a couple. *lol* But I really don’t like how things came to an end between them. I mean he almost died for her but she is ignoring him now? Come on, give that boy a break! I know Elide feels bound to Aelin’s court but if she truly loves Lorcan they should find a way, right? Poor Lorcan, I only feel sorry for him right now and I think he deserves to be loved as much as Elide does. So please can you just get together again and give each other the love you deserve? *looks hopeful*”Lorcan’s onyx eyes were unreadable as he scanned her face. And then he said quietly, “ I wanted to go to Perranth with you.”Considering it all I really enjoyed“Empire of Storms”and thanks to myprecious Gemthis was another wonderful buddy read! =) The only reason I’m giving this four stars is the simple fact that some things felt kind of forced and therefore left me wondering. *lol* It’s just my personal opinion though. Either way, EoS was still an amazing ride and I can’t wait to dive into“Tower of Dawn”. =)) Gem, are you ready for book 6?'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Lysandra is carrying this team on her back.

The way everything just came together? 🤯Reread number 5.———————————————That bitch Maeve! 😤I forgot how painful and intense that ending was.

My heart is still heavy. Numb. I'm devoid of any emotion, since those last few chapters, or reading this book in general, has drained everything out of me. That ending waspainful! And yet, I want to go revisit and reread it! The whole series, back to back!I adore this woman! This series! They've completely consumed my heart! I think I stated this in one of my other ToG reviews, but I haven't fangirled this hard about a series since Potter and it feels SO good.Every plot point came together seamlessly! There were so many moments that had me gasping, actually gasping out loud, moments that made me have an epiphany and I was astounded by how clever the whole plot was, moments that had me genuinely tear up, because it was so painful.Sarah J Maas KNOWS what she's doing with this series. Listening to an interview she did she stated that she knew how she wanted this series to go, how this series was going to end before she got signed by Bloomsbury. So much admiration and love for her!It also helped me majorly that I reread the series before starting Empire of Storms or else I doubt I would've picked up certain plot points or remembered characters and moments that appear in the other books.Seriously, my heart is in agony at the moment. Resurrect myself when the final book is released.*enters grave*""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Full spoiler free review:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr-mo...I FINALLY GODS-DAMNED DID ITIt was long and it was difficult but it was worth it.

Well, maybe it\'ll be one of those books that I rate lower and lower with every time I re-read some parts and revise them in my head. Oh, SJM, you could have done it so much better. Why? Pity.I will start with the flaws.Well, the ""mature"" content that reminded me a bit of fanfictions from AO3, not because it was horrible, but because it was given too many pages and written in an over-the-top manner. That said, I am generally not fond of sex scenes in books and afterASoIaFno sex scene can impress me anymore. So the sex scenes were cringe-worthy. Seriously, worse than ACOMAF because in that one there weren\'t as many.The writing itself, funnily enough, was at times not at its best either. I gushed about the writing in my QoS review, but due to the \'territorial nonsense\' of the Fae in this one and the never-ending repetitions of certain verbs I did not enjoy the writing in this one quite as much but only at these particular moments. Action-scenes were splendidly written. I had honestly not expected that for the simply reason that action/combat scenes are exceptionally difficult to write in a manner that contributes to a build-up of tension and many authors tend to mess them up. But yeah, the emotional parts were very much purple prose, which I am not very fond of.Oh, and another minor aspect that was more annoying than enjoyable - Aelin and Rowan. I loved them together in HoF and QoS, but in this installment their relationship was at times too much even for me. Too sweet, too perfect, too purple. Ugh.And not everyone needs to be paired up. This is such a childish move. Such a stupid, obvious and immature move that I do not appreciate it at all. No, not everyone needs a relationship. This endless pairing up every character that appears both in ACOMAF in here is just endlessly annoying.Now on to the parts that I liked.As I have already stated - the combat scenes. There are many in this book. Seriously, a good deal of this book is fighting be it with magic or not. But the combat scenes contribute to the overall progression of the plot and character development, so it\'s not just pointless bloodshed. In addition to the combat scenes, there is the overall suspense. Fuck sexual tension, I didn\'t care for it, but the tension between the characters who are minutes from gutting each other, that one I loved.The overall atmosphere of this book is darker, more cruel...moreinsanethan in the previous books.Then, there is the ""girl power"". But let\'s call it -flawed and interesting female characters, shall we?! I am tired of 95% of male characters ruling the realm of fantasy and I love the fact that women are so intelligent and vicious in this series.I loved Aelin\'s quiet scheming. All the wrong and right choices that she made.Her sacrifice, her silence, broke my heart at the end.Her development was fantastic and it was believable, particularly the reaction to""Nameless is my price"", I think I\'ll never get over it.It irked me a bit that due to all the action, due to so many things happening simultaneously, there was not much space for SJM to include some in-depth insight into some characters\' heads and their emotional turmoils, but I liked their development nonetheless. Apart from Aelin, there is Lysandra. For me, she is hands down the most mind-blowing character in this entire series by now. All-time-favourite female characters? Lysandra and Manon. But seriouslythis is a minor, but very vague spoiler- so many things would have never worked out without Lysandra. She is the gem of this series.Perhaps with Manon, who has changed rather a lot since book three. Many changes, particularly those that occur in this book, have been forced upon her by the circumstances and her own past and the possible absence of a future, so yes, she changes visibly, but I did not feel like she changes in a manner that is OOC. Same goes for Dorian. It\'s a pity that there wasn\'t much insight into what was going on inside his head, but I still adored him, as much as I did in the previous books. Elide and Aedion were other pleasant surprises. Aedion\'s development was very interesting, as was his relationship with Gavriel and the other Fae and Elide was just overall one big surprise!Moreover, many ""old friends"" make an appearance in this book.Ansel!!! ANSEL OF FREAKING BRIARCLIFF!!!I cannot wait to see them in the final installment and how they will work together. Aelin and her ""court"" are already used to each other, but with so many ""new"" faces it might be a bit of a struggle to coordinate and get along because so many of them are used to rule, not to obey.Lastly, the history and myths of the world of ToG. I am a sucker for good world-building and Maas never disappoints in this regard. Many of the old myths come to live again, some are merely remembered, but even that is enough to dive deeper into this fantastic, ancient world. And the time-line of when certain things occured becomes clearer as well, although with all these revelations more questions arise as well. Not that I minded that, I just hope that SJM won\'t mess it up and won\'t leave the crucial questions unanswered.Let\'s be honest - it could have been so much better. Makes me a bit anxious about the final book, to be honest._________________________Before reading:A year of waiting...'}]"

The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo
",Taylor Jenkins Reid,4.41,3430889,239538,"Fiction, Historical Fiction, LGBT, Contemporary, Audiobook, Queer, Historical",389,13-06-2017,"Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband has left her, and her professional life is going nowhere. Regardless of why Evelyn has selected her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.Summoned to Evelyn’s luxurious apartment, Monique listens in fascination as the actress tells her story.

But intimacy is about truth.

This book is spectacular. This book is outstanding. I have nothing negative to say about this book. It\'s a pure 5 star for me. I\'m irrevocably astonished and astounded.

AFTER THIS LINE I HAD TO FINISH THIS BOOK.And I decided I would finish it. I would read more than 150 pages and finish it. So I went to my obligation the next day with 4 hours of sleep but I was happy about it. Because I knew I couldn\'t survive a whole day without finishing this book. I would die. This is the impact this book has had on me. Now, let\'s talk specifics.Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one in the journalism community is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband, David, has left her, and her career has stagnated. Regardless of why Evelyn has chosen her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.Summoned to Evelyn’s Upper East Side apartment, Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late 80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way. As Evelyn’s life unfolds through the decades—revealing a ruthless ambition, an unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love—Monique begins to feel a very a real connection to the actress. But as Evelyn’s story catches up with the present, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.Historical fiction is my favorite genre of all time. I love it in every form, books, tv shows, movies. But not this kind of historical fiction, theOutlanderandRoss Poldarkkind of historical fiction. The older one, you could say. Also, historical fiction about wars and stuff, which is more recent. But I have never read something about the Old Hollywood. I have only watched movies and tv shows about it. So this was new territory for me.I will admit, it took me about 150 pages to get fully immersed into the story. Up until that point, the book was a 4 star for me. Which is still amazing, but I didn\'t quite understand the hype till that point. A little after Evelyn divulges her secret love, and basically everything starts, my wig is totally snatched. I\'m into the book 100%, ready to knowEVERYTHINGaboutEVERYTHING. The pace was so incredibly fast, there was not a moment I felt my eyes close. The writing was impeccable, some narrations of scenes kept my heart racing. There weren\'t any redundant descriptions of places or rooms, there were descriptions of faces and clothes which kept me enthralled into to the story. The author did an amazing research, it was obvious that she knew her shit, everything was on point. The story kept me on my toes each time with its smart maneuvers, the schemes, the plans, everything the main characters did, all the choices they made, to dodge unfortunate situations. Everything was just... on point. I have nothing bad to say. This never happens. This book was just too perfect. I want to cry because, if not for the hype, I wouldn\'t have picked up this book. And I would have lost such an amazing journey, such an important book. Thank you all for loving this book and making me love it too.Evelyn. Evelyn Hugo is the most flawlessly written character I have ever witnessed. No, wrong. She isn\'t a character to me. She is a person. With influences fromMerilyn MonroeandElizabeth Taylor, the author made Evelyn Hugo her own star. Every time I would read about a scene from one of the movies, I was like ""Oh, I will watch that movie next."", and then I remembered that she doesn\'t actually exist. Which made me sad, because all of the content of this book was so interesting. I felt like I was reading an actual autobiography from a real legendary actress. It was incredible. Evelyn is such a good written character, a good written character, not a good person. She is raw, devious, manipulative, scheming, cold-hearted. She is basically a bitch. But you can\'t help but to want to know everything about her. You want to slap the shit out of her one moment and then hug her the next. She is sensual, enticing, seductive. She always knows what to say to make you believe in her cause. She uses her greatest assets to her benefit, and she isn\'t ashamed about it. She doesn\'t give a fuck. She wants to climb the ladder and she will do anything to achieve her goal. Even marry seven men who will serve her purpose. And she does it. With her scandalous life and her improved acting skills and beneficial movie choices, she climbs to the top. But we also see her sensitive side, her human side. We see her deep friendship with Harry, another remarkable character. We see her love for her child. We see her devotion to Celia. We see her as a human too, with real emotions. And I find that marvelous. I wish all characters in books had so much depth, so much meaning. And not the John Green kind of pretentious deep meaning. The real one.Monique. An underdeveloped character, in my opinion. I didn\'t care that much about her, but her story was gripping. To be honest, Evelyn didn\'t let me care a lot about any other character. She took my attention all to herself. Which is what she did with the entire world. But anyway. An unknown journalist requested to write one of the most popular actresses\' biography. A 35 year old woman, who feels like she hasn\'t achieved much so far in her life. She has a ruined marriage, an under prestigious job, she has been under appreciated all her life, even though she possesses many skills. She is also a POC, and she is mislabeled literally every day. I needed more of her character, I needed to see more of her. But after Evelyn\'s story started, we didn\'t get much of her. But I\'m so happy that she stood up to herself and her self love grew. That Evelyn showed her the way, and she got out of a meaningless marriage, she made deals regarding her job, her future, she stood on her own two feet. I\'m really proud of her.THE REPRESENTATION. THIS BOOK HAD THE BEST REPRESENTATION I HAVE EVER SEEN. Suck it all of you who keep saying a historian fiction can\'t entail good representation.IN YOUR FACES. We have two main interracial characters. One bisexual character, one lesbian character and one gay character. And these are just the main character. We also got side representation, from not as important characters in the story. This factor upped the story so much to me. We got to see the struggles that POV and gay people used to face in a time like this. We got to see our main character hide her true lineage to rise at the top of Hollywood. We got to see two lovers hiding their true sexuality, hiding their undying love for each other because the world would never understand. The conversations between the characters about homophobia of that time period were heartbreaking. I saw so much of our own time in them. So many things have changed since then in our world, and so many have not. We can see the comparisons from these types of books. And it\'s a reminder of how our society is moving forward of backwards. The representation made this book what it is. If every single character was white and straight, I wouldn\'t have been as awed by this book as I am now. And I am myself, a while straight female. Imagine how important representation is for people who can actually relate to it. I would never understand.This book had so many layers. Everything was thought of and processed. Nothing was sloppy, nothing was lacking meaning. Every single word had its reason to be written. I feel privileged to have had the honor of reading this book. It will stick to me for a very long time. I also enjoyed the little snippets we got from the newspapers. They made the setting all the much more real. The relationships were everything, the friendships, the love stories. Evelyn\'s life is so engaging and complicated, you can\'t get enough of it. We truly see how corrupt the Old Hollywood was. And it makes us think about the New Hollywood. Is it still like this? Is everything we see just a fabricated lie? All the lies the characters came up with, seemed to work. I guess, we can never know what happens between closed doors. But I think the New Hollywood is more sincere. It\'s more about talent, at the most part. I\'d like to hope so.In conclusion, I could rave about this book for days. I have so much to say, I could write a book myself. But I\'m gonna end it here. This book was a present sent to me by God himself. I want to read it again and again and again and absorb its wisdom. This book would be such an amazing source material for a movie adaptation.WE NEED THIS TO HAPPEN. But I\'m scared they would ruin it. I\'m always scared with book to movie adaptations. We all readers are. Anyway, I couldn\'t recommend this enough. It doesn\'t matter if you don\'t read historical fiction or adult,PICK THIS BOOK UP. You won\'t regret it one bit. So, till the next one... K BYE!!!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '”Evelyn always leaves you hoping you’ll get just a little bit more. And she always denies you.”This book was so, so, soGOOD!!I swear I was barely two pages in and already knew that I’d love it with all my heart! <3 There’s just something about that golden Hollywood era that captivated me right from the beginning and once Evelyn entered the scene I was a goner. I just loved the way her story was told!We didn’t only get the interviews with Monique but also were able to read news articles about her life and this made everything so much more intriguing. I mean “Hollywood Digest”, “Sub Rosa” or the “New York Tribune”, they all wrote about Evelyn’s life and those articles give an authenticity that makes this book feel real. It could have happened, Evelyn could have been a real Hollywood Star and people could have been as fascinated by her as by Marilyn Monroe or Marlene Dietrich.I think to some degree Taylor Jenkins Reid might have even had Marilyn Monroe in her mind when she wrote Evelyn’s character and knowing how awesome Marilyn was this really doesn’t come as a surprise. XD Another thing I appreciated was that every husband got a part of this book and even though there were seven of them, who all influenced Evelyn and left a mark on her character, none of them actually was her one true love. It’s a very particular approach to a great story and I loved the way it was carried out.Still, after I read the ending my mind was reeling and my feelings were so mixed that I had a tough time coming to terms with everything that was revealed. There were so many things I felt conflicted about and even now, after more than a week has passed, I still didn’t manage to sort out my feelings and I still don’t know what to do with them. Maybe I’ll have to get used to the idea that to think about Evelyn Hugo and her seven husbands will always make me feel conflicted and that there’s no such thing as making peace with an ending like that.And maybe, just maybe, that was Taylor Jenkins Reid’s plan all along. ;-)The characters:Welcome to my characters section, aka “The spoilery spoiler zone”! If you didn’t read the book yet and still want to be surprised by its revelations you better don’t continue to read my review. I’m worse than any tabloid mentioned in this book and I’ll spoil you relentlessly! If you still want to read my gossip, go ahead, but don’t say I didn’t warn you! ;-PEvelyn Hugo:”And I didn’t say I was confessing any sins. To say that what I have to tell is a sin is misleading and hurtful. I don’t feel regret for the things I’ve done – at least, not the things you might expect – despite how hard they may have been or how repugnant they may seem in the cold light of day.”Oh, Evelyn! Where do I even begin? I loved that woman so damn much, I can’t even! <333 It’s so rare to meet such a complex character in a book but damn Evelyn just had it all! She was neither white nor black, and if anything she was all different shades of grey. I loved that she was so ruthless, that she did what she had to do in order to get what she wanted, that she was unapologetic about her decisions and behaviour and that she never held back and just wanted it all! Celia was right, at times Evelyn could be really awful and egoistic, but damn did her good qualities make up for it. Compassionate, caring and protective of the ones she loved she would have done everything possible to keep them safe and happy. Gosh,WHAT. A. WOMAN!I think I might be in love with her! <333”Did I want to make as much money as Don? Of course I did. I wanted to get the paycheck and mail a copy of it to him with a photo of my middle finger. But mostly I wanted the freedom to do whatever I wanted.””I told her every single day that her life had been the world’s greatest gift to me, that I believed I was put on earth not to make movies or wear emerald-green gowns and wave at crowds but to be her mother.””I regret every second I didn’t spend with her. I regret every stupid thing I did that caused her an ounce of pain. I should have chased her down the street the day she left me. I should have begged her to stay. I should have apologized and sent roses and stood on top of the Hollywood sign and shouted, ‘I’m in love with Celia St. James!’ and let them crucify me for it.”Celia St. James:”I really like you. I like watching you on-screen. I like how the moment you show up in a scene, I can’t look at anything else. I like the way your skin is too dark for your blond hair, the way the two shouldn’t go together and yet seem so natural on you. And to be honest, I like how calculating and awful you kind of are.”Now here’s the thing, I know that Celia was the love of Evelyn’s life and I could see that they loved each other deeply, but – and here comes the hugeBUT– I had the feeling that I could never truly connect to her. I don’t know what it was that kept me from adoring her the way I adore Evelyn but I think it might have been the sum of thousands of little things that ultimately left a bad taste in my mouth. For instance I hated that Evelyn always seemed to feel like she had done something wrong and that it was her responsibility to set things right again. I mean Celia threw a lot of awful things at her too, but in the end it always seemed to be Evelyn that blamed herself for it. Also I didn’t like that Celia wasn’t only self-righteous but also more than just a little judgemental. You’d think a person who represents the “L” in LGBTQ+ would be more accepting and open-minded when her partner is bi, but nope Celia was almost as bi-phobic as the men in Evelyn’s life and that made me really sad. =(”That was how it was with Celia. When you denied her what she wanted, when you hurt her, she made sure you hurt, too.””So I told myself that the spark between Celia and me was just a quirk we had. Which was convincing as long as it remained quirky.Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.”Harry Cameron:”I want to be with someone I love. I want to have a companion. I’d like to bring someone home to my family. I don’t want to live alone anymore. And I want a son or a daughter. We could have that together. I can’t give you everything. I know that. But I want to raise a family, and I’d love to raise one with you.”Aside from Evelyn, Harry Cameron wastruly the best thingabout this entire book! <33 I loved this man so much and I think he’s an angel! He was always respectful and supportive and even more important he accepted Evelyn exactly the way she was. I loved that he and Evelyn always tried to solve every problem together and I hated to see him so sad after the death of John. T_T Harry’s grief broke my heart and even though he was drinking way too much he never did anything stupid. I mean he never hurt Evelyn or got frustrated with her, he only tried to compensate his grief without hurting anyone else in the process. Even when it came to this he was considerate and kind. =(( Poor Harry, though. It made me so damn sad that he had to go and I admit it, I actually shed some tears when he died. T_TMonique Grant:”Why, until this moment, did I not realize that the issue is my own confidence? That the root of most of my problems is that I need to be secure enough in who I am to tell anyone who doesn’t like it to go fuck themselves? Why have I spent so long settling for less when I know damn well the world expects more?”To say their relationship was complicated would be putting it more than just mildly! It was really interesting to see Monique’s character arc though. I mean at the beginning she was a shy mouse that didn’t dare to say anything to her boss and by the end of the book she was a young successful woman who stood up for herself and finally had the guts to make decisions she never even dared to consider. I think that to get to know Evelyn and to find out the truth behind her father’s death was necessary to find her happiness and I’m convinced that both of those things were able to give her some closure. I could understand her anger towards Evelyn, her hurt when she found out what she had done and the inability to truly hate her for it. Because she got to know the person behind the movie star and she knew how broken Evelyn was on the inside, how much pain she had suffered, how much loss she had endured. =( Still, that scene when she pondered whether to get on the train or not, the thoughts that crossed her mind, her inner struggle how to deal with the situation at hand. Damn, this was one of the best book moments I ever had the pleasure to read. Well done, Taylor Jenkins Reid, well done! I had goose bumps following that inner conflict. *shudders*”I’m Evelyn.” She reaches out and takes my hand, shaking it. It strikes me as a unique form of power to say your own name when you know that everyone in the room, everyone in the world, already knows it.””I insist that you be ruthless in your negotiating, Monique. Make them pay you what they would pay a white man. And then, once you’ve done that, every penny from it will be yours.”The relationships & ships:Evelyn & Celia:”I wanted to give her a lot of things. I wanted what I had to be hers. I wondered if this was what it felt like to love someone.”Those two were the death of me, I swear! Their ups and downs, their struggles and fights, their love and dreams, their hopes and shattered realities. ARGH! It was so obvious they loved each other, yet they could never be together. Because the world didn’t let them and wouldn’t have understood, because they didn’t want the same thing, because they weren’t ready to be in a relationship and unable to make arrangements. Because… justBECAUSE!There was always another reason why they couldn’t be happy, another misunderstanding that tore at their foundations, another bump on the road that caused them to drift apart. They loved and lost and loved and lost again. It was so heart-breaking to watch! And Celia, she killed me. With everything she said to Evelyn! I knew she loved her, yet she hurt her so much! >_< I just wished she would have had more sympathy for Evelyn’s outlook and I really wish she would have tried to understand Evelyn’s sexuality. So many of their problems could have been solved, they could have gained so many years if they just would have allowed themselves to be who they are. Their love was so tragic… more tragic than any of the movies they produced over the years. And it really made me sad. T_T”Evelyn, who was your great love? You can tell me.”Evelyn looks out the window, breathes in deeply, and then says, “Celia St. James.”The room is quiet as Evelyn lets herself hear her own words. And then she smiles, a bright, wide, deeply sincere smile. She starts laughing to herself and then refocuses on me. “I feel like I spent my entire life loving her.””It’s not wrong,” Celia said. “It shouldn’t be wrong, to love you. How can it be wrong?”“It’s not wrong, sweetheart. It’s not,” I said. “They’re wrong.””If you love someone enough, you should be able to overcome anything,” she said. “And we have always loved each other so much, more than I ever thought I could be loved, more than I ever thought I could love. So why … why couldn’t we overcome it?”“We did,” I said, turning towards her. “We’re here.”She shook her head. “But the years,” she said.”There’s a difference between sexuality and sex. I used sex to get what I wanted. Sex is just an act. Sexuality is a sincere expression of desire and pleasure. That I always kept for Celia.”Evelyn & Harry:”You do not know how fast you have been running, how hard you have been working, how truly exhausted you are, until someone stands behind you and says, “It’s OK, you can fall down now. I’ll catch you.”So I fell down.And Harry caught me.Their friendship was everything, absolutelyE.V.E.R.Y.T.H.I.N.G.!!!Gosh, I loved their relationship so much, I can’t even!!! They were so perfect together and understood each other better than anyone else. They were so close it sometimes felt like they could read each other’s mind and I think of all the husbands Evelyn married over the years, Harry definitely was the best! <333 (Of course her last hubby was awesome too but if you ask me no one was able to hold a candle to Harry!) I know Harry was gay and had no sexual desire for women and I know that Evelyn loved Celia but damn those two made so much sense! They shared a love that is sometimes even harder to find than the once in a lifetime love we all crave for and they were so much more than just friends. They were business partners, equals, best friends, partners in crime, confidants, soul mates and kindred spirits. And most importantly, they loved each other deeply! <333 It’s so rare to find a friend like that, so rare to have a connection like that, to be loved liked that… ARGH! I justLOVEDthem!!! This was such a wholesome representation of a deep friendship and I’m incapable to put it into words. *breaks down and sobs*”I promise I’ll do whatever I can. I promise you we will figure this out.”“OK,” Harry said, and then he squeezed my hand back and walked out the door. “We will figure this out.””I want you to stay, Harry. We need you. Me and Connor.” I grabbed his hand tighter. “But if you have to go, then go. Go if it hurts. Go if it’s time. Just go knowing you were loved, that I will never forget you, that you will live in everything Connor and I do. Go knowing I love you purely, Harry, that you were an amazing father. Go knowing I told you all my secrets. Because you were my best friend.”The bi rep:”It really makes you think, doesn’t it? That people were so eager to believe we were swapping spouses but would have been scandalized to know we were monogamous and queer?”And now we finally come to one of the most important subjects of this book: The bi rep! And let me tell you, it was spot-on! Evelyn is a bi icon and for the rest of my life I’ll never get tired of emphasizing how important this kind of representation is! Throughout the entire book Evelyn is confronted with bi-phobia but she always took it in stride! She accepted herself the way she was and she did an amazing job at trying to explain her sexuality. I know some of you might say that it shouldn’t even be necessary to explain your sexuality to others and I’m inclined to agree, but the bitter truth is that we have to explain it no matter if we want to or not. I can only speak from personal experience here but usually straight people have a hard time understanding how you can love both sexes equally and make no difference, while lesbian or gay people might just try to label you as one of their own. What Celia did?! It happens! It happens way too often and even though her actions and behaviour left a bitter taste in my mouth it still represented one of the many facets of reality. I loved the way Taylor Jenkins Reid gave Evelyn a voice though. Evelyn Hugo didn’t accept those prejudices, nope, she gave us her honest opinion, her point of view and made the other characters acknowledge her for who she was! And this was wholesome and healthy and might help a lot of people to accept themselves! So thank you Taylor Jenkins Reid! Thank you very much! <333”Being bisexual didn’t make me disloyal,” Evelyn says. “One has nothing to do with the other. Nor did it mean that Celia could only fulfil half my needs.””I hated being called a lesbian. Not because I thought there was anything wrong with loving a woman, mind you. No, I’d come to terms with that a long time ago. But Celia only saw things in black and white. She liked women and only women. And I liked her. And so she often denied the rest of me.””Wow,” he said. “Incredible. I married a dyke.”“Stop saying that,” I said.“Evelyn, if you have sex with women, you are a lesbian. Don’t be a self-hating lesbian. That’s not… that’s not becoming.”My conclusion:The more I think about this book, the more I love it! This is such an important read! I know Reid tackled a lot of problematic topics in this book, but she did it in such a positive and sensible way that I’m convinced everyone who reads“The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo”will learn something good from it! I’m usually not the kind of person who throws a book at you and says you should read it but in all seriousness: Read this one! Live and suffer with Evelyn, enjoy her good moments and cry with her when the world throws her for a loop! Hate her, love her, accept her the way she is. And most importantly, learn from her mistakes and don’t hesitate to show the world your true self. ;-)I know this review has been already way too long but I still want to thank the ever charmingAshleyfor this wonderful buddy read! We both didn’t have it easy while reading this book together, but we always managed to find a compromise and were able to continue once our lives started to become a little less hectic. *lol* I’m glad we could read this together and I hope sooner or later we’ll find another book to buddy read again! =)'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '➸4.5 stars➷ the seven husbands of evelyn hugo by taylor jenkins reid is a captivating novel that delves into the glamorous and tumultuous life of the enigmatic hollywood icon, evelyn hugo. the story is narrated by monique grant, a young journalist who is given the exclusive opportunity to interview evelyn hugo, now in her late seventies, about her legendary career and her seven marriages and tumultuous relationships that shaped her career and personal life. as monique delves deeper into evelyn’s story, she uncovers shocking revelations that force her to confront her own past and identity.— this book honestly surpassed my expectations. i’m always a bit iffy about reading popular books, but i absolutely loved this story! i honestly did not expect it to make me cry so much, seriously this book had no right ripping my heart out into tiny little pieces. i don’t even think this was supposed to be an emotional read but my heart just broke for these characters and how they weren’t allowed to love whoever they wanted. i grew so attached to these characters and parting ways with them was such a tragedy to me lmaoo. evelyn, celia, harry and john are truly my little family. i should’ve closed the book after the picnic scene and just pretended that they all lived happily ever after 😭💔tjr’s writing style is just mesmerising. she has this incredible ability for drawing you into her stories with such vivid detail that you feel like you’re right there in the moment, experiencing everything alongside her characters. this story transports us back into old hollywood and it makes me feel like i’m immersed into the glitz and glamour of the ‘50s and ‘60s silver screen.psa: mick riva needs his own tw. i’m so tired of having to see that deadbeat’s name!! he is a jump scare at this point.➳evelyn hugo:“i’m bisexual, don’t ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box.”she’s an icon, she’s a legend and she is the moment. she’s so effortlessly glamorous, she’s brilliant and powerful but that doesn’t mean she is a good person — but she’s not an unlikeable character. i understand all the decisions and sacrifices she had to make to get to where she is in life. she done some horrible things, but she would NEVER take them back because she only wanted to protect the people she loved the most. she is a flawed character, she’s ruthless, selfish, manipulative and she is unapologetic about her life choices and wasn’t afraid to use her body to get important roles. evelyn always has to get her own way but that made me love her even more and what gave her so much depth. she lived her life the best way she could. she had a dream she was determined to fulfil and she knew what she had to do to make her dream a reality.➳celia st. james:“all i’ve ever wanted was for you to be truly mine. but you’ve never been mine. not really. i’ve always had to settle for one piece of you. while the world gets the other half. i don’t blame you. it doesn’t make me stop loving you. but i can’t do it. i can’t do it, evelyn.”SCREAMING, CRYING, THROWING UP!! I WILL KEEP SAYING IT, THEY DESERVED MORE TIME TOGETHER!! TJR YOU ARE A SICK WOMAN, YOU WILL BE HEARING FROM MY THERAPIST 😭😭oh celia, the love of evelyn’s life. she’s another complicated character but i actually loved her, she’s the complete opposite to evelyn. she embodies kindness and compassion in her own right. while evelyn was portrayed as confident and assertive, celia’s demeanour was more reserved and gentle. she could be mean-spirited towards evelyn, i get she always done it out of hurt and jealousy but she had to understand that evelyn went to great lengths to protect their relationship from ever being exposed. but celia loved and cared for evelyn so deeply. tjr perfectly captured celia’s selfishness and her closeted struggles, as well as her complicated feelings with having to share evelyn with others. i would do ANYTHING for celia’s pov especially during the time when they didn’t talk for 5 years 😖➳harry cameron:“it’s ok, you can fall down now. i’ll catch you.” so i fell down. and harry caught me.the friendship between evelyn and harry is truly so special. they are the epitome of ‘platonic soulmates.’ he was present for the majority of evelyn’s life. their friendship is built on a foundation of mutual respect and understanding. they will always have each others back no matter the circumstances. my heart broke with him when he lost john because he ended up losing himself that day too. i loved his relationship with his daughter, she was truly the light of his life and what kept him going. he deserved the world and he deserved so much better. we all deserve a harry cameron in our life <33➳monique grant:as evelyn’s chosen confidante, monique finds herself drawn into a world of glamour and intrigue far removed from her own humble existence. tasked with penning evelyn’s long-awaited memoir, monique is granted unparalleled access to the inner workings of evelyn’s mind and heart, a privilege that comes with its own set of challenges and responsibilities. but i’m going to be straight up and say that her character honestly has no importance to me whatsoever. as a secondary character she was overshadowed by evelyn’s life and her character lacked so much depth. the reveal of the significant plot connection to evelyn later on left me feeling underwhelmed due to the lack of emphasis on monique and her story throughout the book.꒰evelyn + celia:꒱“i spent half my time loving her and the other half hiding how much i loved her.”i am a evelyncelia defender for life!! if they have no fans, i am dead. their love story is absolutely heartbreaking. their connection is electric, their moments together is filled with so much raw emotion and undeniable chemistry. yet as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that they are star-crossed lovers, bound by societal expectations and personal sacrifices. yes it seemed complex but at times their relationship was toxic. the ache for more time together is palpable — i’m so mad bc i wish they had so much more time together, to bask in their love without the constraints of society or circumstance. they were robbed of many precious moments and they lost so many years. every stolen moment between them is filled with longing and passion, it constantly had me yearning for more. yet amidst all the heartache, their love for one another shines so brightly. they are truly the epitome of soulmates. their relationship was so heart wrenching because they truly deserved so much better. they deserved to love each other freely and unabashedly!! ❤️\u200d🩹— overall, this book is a masterful tapestry of love, ambition, and the search for identity set against the dazzling backdrop of old hollywood. tjr’s exquisite prose and nuanced characters invite readers on an unforgettable journey, challenging them to reflect on the true cost of fame and the enduring power of authenticity. with its gripping narrative and rich historical detail, this novel transcends its genre, leaving a lasting impression on all who have the pleasure of delving into evelyn hugo’s captivating world. this story made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me angry but i adored this book and these character with my whole heart. i can’t wait for the netflix adaption, my heart is going to be broken all over again and i’m so ready for it lmaoo.───♡─────────────why did this book have me crying like a lil bitch 😭 i am evelyn hugo’s #1 defender until the day i die!! rtc—this slump is eating me alive!!! also the fact i still haven’t read this book is criminal. in tjr we trust 😩'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""This review contains a spoiler for a reveal around 100 pages into the novel. I knew this reveal going in and do not believe knowing this reveal hurts the reading experience.I think a lot about the idea of love as something dangerous, as something that you have to fight for. And it's only recently that I've decided that's something that probably has to do with loving women. I have been very lucky, in growing up in liberal California and in the 2000s. But I received marriage rights in my country four months after realizing I liked girls, and in reading about the past and thinking about the past, I am constantly, daily, reminded how being born ten years earlier would have made everything that much more dangerous, that much more violent, that much more fearful.And there is something so woefully romantic to me about the fact that there were people who braved that climate and loved anyway and paved the path, while doing so, for me and so many others.So that's all to say that this book made me experience all five stages of grief and simultaneously made me feel every positive emotion in the world and I have no idea how that is possible. but listen, if you only read one book I recommend you this year, I want it to be this one.“Make them pay you as much as they would a white man.”The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugois, yeah, about the seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo. Seven husbands who are sometimes awful and sometimes sympathetic and sometimes somewhere in between. Ernie, who she used to get to where she is, Don, who beat her till she barely knew whether to continue, Harry, who she loved more than any of them, Max, who loves the idea of her more than he could ever love her.But I think, despite its marketing, this book is really about Evelyn.Awful, complicated, completely lovable Evelyn. Evelyn is a flawed, compelling, brave, ambitious woman who got to where she was with teeth and claws and never gave up. She is also, and I’m not even joking, one of the most iconic characters I have ever had the pleasure of reading about. She is a woman with a lot of ambition but also one who loves and wants to be loved. She issucha good character.This book is also fiercely and unapologetically socio-political and Ilovethat. Evelyn’s story is one of being a woman in a man’s world. It is one of being a Cuban woman in a white woman’s world. It is one of being a bisexual woman in an era where attraction to women was demonized by the whole culture. It is one of hiding yourself for ambition, one of trying to decide which one takes precedent, one of aging, and one of never knowing whether your choices wereright.Annnnnnnd this book also has the most fucking heartbreaking romantic relationship I have had the displeasure to read about in my entire life. I don’t… I don’t know if romantic relationships should be considered spoilers, but… well, I knew going in who the actual love of Evelyn’s life was and it STILL WORKED FOR ME. So here it is: Evelyn Hugo and Celia St. James are one of my favorite fictional relationships, of all time, ever. These two have a complicated, flawed, at times tumultous relationship, and yet they love each other so much, always.“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.”And perhaps my favorite part was the messaging around the importance of actual love in relationships, rather than just a willingness to try.“You didn't come here and tell me how much you miss me. Or how hard it has been to live without me. You said you didn't want to give up. And I don't want to give up, either. I don't want to fail at this. But that's not actually a great reason to stay together. We should have reasonswhywe don't want to give. It shouldn't just bethatwe don't want to give up. And I don't... have any.“You have never felt like my other half.”I know I’ve talked about a lot of specific things in the book, but I don’t know exactly how to put into words what this bookmeantto me. You can almost feel how much Taylor Jenkins Reidfeltthis book.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugoleft me an emotional mess, but also ahappymess. All I know is I feel ruined for any other book, and I want you to be as well.Blog|Goodreads|Twitter|Youtube""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""CLICK HERE for a Booktube Videoabout:Ten Fabulous Book Reviews and One That Will Make You Go -doesn't that belong to Miranda Reads?Now that you know this one made the list check the video review to see the rest (and find the stolen surprise)!The Written Review3.75 starsHeartbreak is a loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.Evelyn Hugo was the star of the century.She dominated the big screen for more than four decades. Every man wanted her and every woman wanted to be her.Perhaps most famously, Evelyn Hugo wasmarried seven times.Each divorce only increased her fame.Rumors swept through the tabloids like wildfire.I’m under absolutely no obligation to make sense to you.And now, age 79, Evelyn Hugo decided to auction off her mostwildly famous gownsand offered one lucky journalist (Monique) an interview that will last a lifetime.However, Monique soon learns that this is beyond a two-page spread. Evelyn Hugo is offering a tell-all - a full biography - that promises to be the mostscandalous and salaciousthing that has ever graced this world.Monique would be a fool - an absolute fool - to pass this up. But the thought, the 'it's too good to be true' sort of thought, continues to replay in her mind.Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.Overall, this one was good but I was never wowed.Everyone and their mother was talking up this book and while I agree that it is engaging and scandalous (in a good way)...I don't know.I just expected more from it.I definitely think it was well-written...just a bit dull in areas.We start the book with 40 pages of just talking up Evelyn Hugo and it really did drag. There's only so many times I can hear about howwonderful and stunninga person is before it gets boring.I think if more of the marriages were teased in the beginning - just to give the audience a taste of the mystery surrounding her love life (rather than going on and on about how intriguing it was...without telling us what was intriguing about it) would have helped significantly.Once we got to her life, the book certainly picked up.I really lovedhow Evelyn's sexuality was portrayedin this book. I liked watching her grow as a person - from a teenager using sex to get herself out of a hellhole to falling in love and finding it something to be cherished.Her love forCeliathroughout the years truly made thiswildly unbelievable story cinchfor me. Honestly,her relationship with CeliaTheir love was expertly done, with all of the fear and paranoia associated with the times, that it truly felt like real life.Ultimately, this was an enjoyable read, a bit slow paced, but enjoyable nonetheless!Never let anyone make you feel ordinary.YouTube|Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Facebook| Snapchat @miranda_reads""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""WOW I NEVER POSTED THIS. What a pleasant surprise! After dozens of unposted-unwritten reviews, finally an unposted-but-written one. Life is beautiful.But first off (I can call this first off if I freaking want to!!!) I wanna say: DON’T LET ANYONE TELL YOU THAT HISTORICAL FICTION CAN’T BE DIVERSE. Tell that anthropomorphized tennis ball they’re either uncreative or a secret bigot or a full-on dunce or ALL THREE. Because this book pulls it off with more than a tablespoon of grace, I’ll tell you that.My guy, there aren’t even that many characters in this book. And we’re following the majority of them starting in the 1950s. Not exactly, y’know, the peak of support for diversity in America. AND STILL WE DON’T LACK FOR REPRESENTATION. Do you get how great that is? I’m ready to punch the whitesplainers of Disney’s Frozen in their boring pale faces. The word “Frozen” is actually a reference to the lack of movement in the creativity centers of their brains. (Follow for more behind the scenes Disney-Pixar facts.)This book includes three (three!) interracial relationships. Actually, it’s more like ten if you count the fact that our protagonist is Latina. Yes! This may be the bare minimum, but I’m so used to YA wherein one pale as snow teen romances a - gasp - pale aspaperteen! Diversity in young adult books = one character is of Western European descent and the other Eastern European. Talk about a vanilla romance. (Buh dum ch.)This book proves how important it is to provide diversity. The difference in the believability and intricacy of the story is incredible.I will say we don’t often get a good look at the variance in culture that comes with diversity here. Evelyn Hugo, though the daughter of Cuban immigrants, purposefully represses her heritage in order to fit in with the whitewashed 1950s and ’60s cinema scene. Our narrator, though half-black, expresses a fear that someone will tell her she’s “not black enough.” I wish the ethnic diversity played a little more into the text, but it didn’t feel unrealistic or anything. The reasoning was explained.But there’s even more diversity. Like, it gets even better. Because, again, despite the time setting, this book contains A SH*T TON of LGBT+ rep. And these are some of the most beautifully portrayed LGBT+ relationships I’ve ever read. If you don’t read this book for anything else, read it for that fine-ass inclusion, boi.Beyond that, this is the ultimate guilty pleasure book. IT IS SO FUN READING ABOUT OLD HOLLYWOOD AND OLD MOVIES. I wanted to watch the entire Evelyn Hugo canon after this, and then it was like, oh wait, she’s not real.I don’t have much else to say. This is chick-lit-y historical fiction at its finest. It’s just so fun. Some people say they got bored halfway through, and I get why you could, but I didn’t. I really fell in love with the world of this book, and the depiction of Old Hollywood, and all that jazz.A lot is revealed over the course of the book, and the best part is just being surprised at each twist and turn, so I don’t want to go to specifics even a little. I’m just going to cut off this review here before I risk, like, accidentally mentioning that Evelyn Hugo’s third husband turned her into a vampire and she was a vampire the whole time and she turns Monique at the end of the book.*Damn it!Bottom line: This is very fun and cool and maybe even important. Read it!!!*This isn’t true, by the way. Duh.----------------------rereading updateswas tempted to spend my whole day watching old movies and not reading at all.compromised by rereading this instead.this was a very good plan.----------------------pre-reviewThis book? It's really great.I got a hell of a lot more than I bargained for.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""This right here. This is why I read. For the joy and privilege of coming across an exquisite story like this and being swept up in its magic.CouldThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugoreally be fiction, dreamt up entirely in Taylor Jenkins Reid's mind? Every moment felt so real, so tangible. When I reached the end, it was hard to let go, hard to return to a world where this was nothing more than a figment of the imagination.Evelyn Hugo, revered Hollywood actress and icon, is finally ready to tell the story of her life. But she wants to make sure that whatever comes out is authentic to who she is. So she contacts Monique Grant, a mostly unknown writer, to be her scribe. Everyone is surprised by the choice, no one more so than Monique herself. But to be given the chance to write Evelyn's memoir and to understand the person behind the legend is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, one that Monique can't pass up.When I first started this, I thought I was in for a fluffy, gossipy romance set in the golden Hollywood era. After all, why would anyone need so many husbands unless one was in it for a good time? But this turned out to be so much more. At its heart, it's a stunning and brutally honest portrayal of love in all its different forms. It shows not just the joy of love, but also its sacrifices and heartbreaks.I was blown away by how complex of a character Evelyn Hugo is. She is the heart and soul of this story, and her character shines so bright, it's hard to look away. She feels real, coming off the pages wholly formed. She's not perfect. In fact, her flaws and numerous questionable actions make her human, and it's easy to relate to her and cheer for her.The book is written in alternative viewpoints, a little bit from Monique's perspective as she interviews Evelyn and a lot from Evelyn's perspective as she shares the story of her life. When a book has two different viewpoints, there's always a fear that one is more interesting than the other. But not here. I can honestly say that every moment of this book was equally riveting.I adored Reid's writing style. It's filled with so much charm that it just oozes off the pages. The story obviously tackles serious issues, but the writing never takes itself too seriously. It's witty and funny, drawing me in and making me feel every emotion. It manages to convey so much nuance without ever slowing down the pacing or seeming long-winded. I'm in awe.You guys know I'm a romantic through and through. And this story is all about finding and holding on to that great love of your life, no matter what it takes. I mean, how could I not be drawn to that? I'm also a realist and I know that love takes so much sacrifice. So this story spoke to my heart and my mind.I never really had a chance. This book had me good and hooked, right from the first page. It's the sort of story I know I'll come back to again and again, savoring it anew every time.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:Carrie Soto Is BackDaisy Jones & The SixMalibu Rising~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

It's not the kind of thing I usually pick up, and I haven't read anything by Reid before. But something about it intrigued me. So I checked out the kindle sample. Just a couple chapters, I figured, because I probably wouldn't like it anyway.And I was HOOKED.It's perfect, easy beach read material. It's not particularly deep, it does not take the genre to new levels or make you think about something new, and yet it DID feel different. Evelyn Hugo's story was sodelicious and compellingthat it stood out, and kept me turning pages in a desperate need to discover the stories behind her seven husbands, and the answer to the one question everyone wants to know: who was her greatest love?The framing of the story reminded me a lot ofThe Thirteenth Tale. Like that book, inThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, a young woman - this time an ambitious journalist called Monique Grant - goes to interview an elderly woman. UnlikeThe Thirteenth Tale, this elderly woman happens to be one of the most famous actresses in the world.Evelyn Hugo has lived a life in the public eye, but she is full of secrets. Only she knows what happened behind the scenes in her long career of scandals and highly-publicized heartbreaks. Just like the fictional world of the book longed to know the truth-- so did I. Reid and Evelyn's habit of giving you just enough to leave you wanting more was incredibly exciting. Throughout, we are encouraged to wonder why someone like Evelyn Hugo would specifically request a relatively-inexperienced journalist like Monique. Why Monique? What is Evelyn hiding?The more I got to know Evelyn, the more I fell in love with her. She has made a lot of controversial decisions during her career, but she knows it and she also knows she'd probably do it all again. She's played the Hollywood game, dated famous men to further her career, and used her body to get what she wants. She has experienced the full force of the industry's sexism and, in some ways, capitalized on it. She is deeply flawed and aware of it. She has traded important aspects of her identity for more fame, more roles, more money. She was a badass Cuban woman working in an industry that didn't like women to be badass or Cuban. She manipulated and she lied.Despite everything - and because of it - I liked her.I stayed fully engrossed in the story of Evelyn Hugo - and of Monique Grant - from the opening chapters when Evelyn demanded an interview with only Monique, through decades of Hollywood in all its shimmering ugliness, right until the ending's final reveals.I enjoyed every moment.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Best rereading choice for flashback Saturday is re-devouring my all time favorite TJR book!Evelyn Hugo a. k. a.

She knows what she wants for her life and she’s competitive and determined enough how she may get it by leaving her life in Hell’s Kitchen and moving to Los Angeles to become one of the movie stars, dying her hair, exposing her slender body, looking directly at the camera with her almond shaped eyes under her long lashes till the director tells her “cut”.Now she’s 79, married SEVEN TIMES, a Hollywood legend, ready to share her life story and scandalous secret she kept for years. She befriends 35 years old Monique Grant, an unknown reporter works for “Vivant” in Los Angeles. Even the boss of Monique has no clue why this Hollywood legend demanded to work with her: she could choose someone more experienced, popular, known in the industry.So many question balloons start to fly above our heads:- Why Evelyn wants to talk only Monique and if she doesn’t, the memoir deal will be off?- Why Evelyn married seven times. Did she love any of her husbands? Does she have resentments? Does she suffer from heartbreak? Which one of is the love of her life?-As soon as their interview starts, Evelyn takes her an adventurous train ride with full of juicy, entertaining, heartbreaking, emotional stories starting from glamorous 60’s of La La Land, the productions of her famous movies, how her path crossed with those men, how she saved them and they saved her, how she got hurt, how she shone, how she burned… and eventually a big secret reveals about her life story which will change everything about true identity of Evelyn and the life choices she’s made!It’s brilliant! It’s unputdownable, addictive, heartfelt time travel in Hollywood. Author’s genuine approach to LGBTQ was better reflected than Ryan Murphy’s Hollywood limited series on Netflix.If you haven’t read it, don’t miss out this masterpiece and the best of the best Taylor Jenkins Reid book ( I liked it even more than Daisy Jones and the six)My favorite quotes:“Don\'t ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box. Don’t do that.”“You do not know how fast you have been running, how hard you have been working, how truly exhausted you are, until somewhat stands behind you and says, “It’s OK, you can fall down now. I’ll catch you.”“Heartbreak is a loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.”""Do you understand what I\'m telling you? When you\'re given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world doesn\'t give things, you take things. If you learn one thing from me, it should probably be that.”“…do yourself a favor and learn to grab life by the balls, dear. Don’t be so tied up in trying to do the right thing when the smart thing is so painfully clear.”'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'this didn\'t work for me, but i get how it could work for othersthere\'s something so glamorous and sad about the golden age of film. throw in a cuban bisexual main character who has to hide her identities and it\'s a sure fire way to get people intrigued. and i was, throughout the entirety of the book. this book did not lack in keeping my interest.but there were too many things i had issue with. and if i hadn\'t read all but one of TJR\'s previous works i might have been able to overlook it. but once i notice a pattern it tends to color my judgment of an author\'s work.2 big things for me: writing & relationshipsfirst, i knew going into this that TJR\'s writing does not work for me. it\'s not hard to digest which is nice. but the writing is so clear and no frills that it\'s odd when we get these little nuggets of prescriptive morality. she doesn\'t want the reader to form their own opinions, she\'s rather just hold your hand to the ""point."" which happens in almost all of her books. makes for a super quotable book, but for me it felt forced at times.and then the relationships. that was 99% of my issue with this book. it wasn\'t that Evelyn was a wholly unlikable character, it was her relationship with Celia that grated on my last nerve. again, this is something that is a recurring theme in TJR\'s book and honestly i hope to god this is not something she has intimate knowledge of. but it seems like the only way she can write relationship problems is by making the love interest awful. they have to have blow out fights, say things they could never take back/should have never been said, leave each other etc.and i\'m not saying that this doesn\'t happen in real life. but after the first time this kind of thing happens, i could like to see the characters grow and learn how to cope like adults. because i\'m only 24 and evenidon\'t pull those kinds of stunts with my boyfriend. cause i\'m not 16 anymore.and this issue was particularly egregious to me because yes sure the time period was hostile to F/F relationships. but when you have a veritable shit load of money you can cover things up. that wasn\'t the issue. these two were just too pigheaded to make things work. so. so. irritating.lastlythere is a plot twist that occurs that the end of the book that i really did not appreciate. the twist itself was not bad but given the main character\'s identity in relation to a deceased person\'s identity i was honestly appalled. you would think a POC understands POC struggles and wouldn\'t frame a fellow POC but what do i know.it was just a detail that really rubbed me the wrong way.all that being saidit was really refreshing to see exploration into a time period, culture, and sexuality that is not often explored. i know some people really identify with these characters and i\'m glad this book exists. it just did not work for me.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is genuinely one of the most remarkable novels I have ever read. It is a favorite of the year, it will be a favorite of all time. I am wholly enchanted byThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugoand I will never forget how much I adore this book.CW: domestic abuse, death/grief, homophobia/biphobia, racismabortion & suicideAdult fiction is not typically my cup of tea, especially a combination of historical fiction and contemporary with the amount of long flashbacks (flashbacks: ALSO NOT MY THING). I have no idea how this combination of literary elements I typically do not like consumed my entire being, but it did. Taylor Jenkins Reid is an immensely talented author. Her prose is beautiful, vivid, and descriptive. There isn’t a moment throughout this story where I was bored or underwhelmed. Every second of this book is completely engaging – it was a huge struggle to put the book down.Evelyn Hugo is one of the greatest literary characters I have ever had the pleasure to read from. The exploration of her Cuban heritage and bisexuality is fascinating, especially given the era and her celebrity status. She is one of those intoxicating characters you will never be able to purge from your mind with her strong will, her independence, her strength, her cunning, and her compassion. Evelyn Hugo is unforgettable in my mind and hearing her story was one of the greatest pleasures I think I have ever experienced as a reader.Personally, I didn’t LOVE Monique, though I am always happy to see another biracial main character in literature. I appreciated her contribution to the story as I feel the book would lose some of it’s strength if there was not another character for Evelyn to explain her actions and motivations to and it was just her story, but it’s for that reason that I sometimes felt she was more of a plot device than an individual character. Compared to Evelyn, I just did not care for Monique’s individual life and problems. I enjoyed seeing how Evelyn influenced her life, but her storyline was so drab compared to Evelyn. Edit 4/3/2019 - After a second read, I GREATLY appreciate Monique. Her character is so nuanced and necessary to the story. I totally relinquish much of my initial feelings on her.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugois one of my favorite books OF ALL TIME. I will never forget how in love I am with this story and all the ways it has affected me.

This book came in and knocked me off my feet.Monique is working for Vivant, a media company, when she is requested to interview Evelyn Hugo, a very famous movie actress, who has refused to give interviews for years. Evelyn starts to reveal her story to Monique, that life isn\'t perfect, that people are more than just one thing, that relationships are complicated, the power of forgiveness and reinvention, the idea of family, loss, and accepting the choices of others.This book had such depth and tackled so many issues. One of them was the concept of divorce. Growing up in a Baptist church, divorce was viewed as the ultimate sin. As soon as anyone heard that someone was divorced, they had a permanent scarlet letter attached to them. However, as I matured, life isn\'t nearly as black and white. Do you really know what happened? Did the man beat this woman and then run off with all of the money, just to teach her a lesson? Why does society still think it is OK to stigmatize divorced people?There were a tremendous amounts of very quotable quotes, and this was one of those rare books that you hope never has to end.""There are people who see a beautiful flower and rush over to pick it.""This book also tackled some of the issues that women face. ""Oh, I know the whole world prefers a woman who doesn\'t know her power, but I\'m sick of all that.""

It reminded me of the family sagas of the yore, kind of likeThe Thorn Birds. Only this book needed another 300 pages to dig deeper into the dramas of Evelyn's life and her psyche. I was entertained by the events of Hugo's Hollywood adventures, but ultimately this book lacks depth. Nobody else noticed how superficial everything is in this novel - relationships, emotions, portrayals of race and queerness?The novel is framed as a biography written by a talented up-and-coming jornalist, but reads as if thrown together by an employee of a gossip rag, who included all of the salacious parts of a famous person's life, but none of that person's interiority.Totally see why it's a bestseller.

Evelyn Hugo is announcing that she will auction 12 of her most memorable gowns through Christie’s to raise money for breast cancer research, of which her daughter, Connor, died.Monique Grant is a reporter for the magazine, Vivant, and is specifically by Evelyn Hugo to write her autobiography, but, why Monique? What does she have for someone like the legend Evelyn Hugo wants her to write a book about her life? That\'s the interesting part.So, Monique goes to Evelyn\'s aparment and listens her story. From how Evelyn lost her mother and how she swored she would get out of Hell\'s Kitchen, away from her father and poverty, and because her mother dreamt with became someone famous and live in Hollywood one day. She was born Evelyn Elena Herrera, daughter of Cuban parents, but had to change her name by Evelyn Hugo.She talks about how she made her way to L.A, how much she sacrificed and her husbands, of course.My 3 favorite husbands are: Rex North (he was one of my 3 favorite marriages) to get more money for the movie their starring: Anna Karenina (the gods know how I much love Anna Karenina, so I\'d have given my kidney or soul to see that movie).

Evelyn and Celia get back together, and Harry and John are dating, which is cuTE, DON\'T TOUCH MY KIDS. Evelyn and Harry have a kid: Connor.

They do it, but then, Harry dies in a car accident, where was another man with him. Evelyn is devastated by the loss of her best friend and let me tell you that I cried so much with this.When Celia died, a big part of me died with her. It was heartbreaking.""I had lost her. My love. My Celia. My soulmate. The woman whose love I\'d spent my life earning.It broke me. I cried until my head hurted.The pacing was amazing.

I wanted to know more and more, until I got to the end, until there was nothing but my broken heart and my tears falling on my shirt.The characters had an incredible an amazing development. You fall for most of them, and wanna kick many of them too. *cough* Don, Mick, Max. *cough*Evelyn is such a badass woman. A legend. An icon. Not just that.

Ugh, that ruined me as well.All the feelings in this book are deep and explores the sexuality and feelings of a woman who didn\'t know she could feel more for someone else than a man.

I don't think I've ever had as immediate a reaction as I did to reading this book. I feel like my updates have made my distaste for this book pretty evident, but in case it wasn't I'm going to walk through all the things I hated about this book one final time before I try and put as much space between me and this work of fiction as humanly possible.I knew going into the book that Evelyn Hugo was a Latinx character, it wasn't until I started reading though that I discovered our other narrator, Monique, was also a woman of color. [ Don't call her black though, she's biracial. ] And almost immediately I was uncomfortable with this ide. That said I carried on thinking that I was probably just stretching, reaching for things that weren't there. That said I think that the narrative utterly fails at the nuance necessary to tell the story of a Cuban-American finding success in the 50s. Utterly fails to depict the nuance in the way that someone like Evelyn would have to navigate the world, or how her racial identity would have had an impact on most of the things she experienced in life. It's really only brought up at the beginning when she's initially denied roles and Evelyn immediately pivots into this racially ambiguous/spicy white category that she's happy with becuase it ensures her success. That doesn't stop her from later bing mad that her maid doesn't know she's Cuban even though she's actively tried to supress that side of her for literally decades. I won't even get into how the narrative makes Evelyn retiring to Spain to make tortillas her reconnecting with her Cuban roots or how Monique actively distances heself from blackness while never questioning the impact that being raised by a single white mother following the death of her black father might have any role in that. You really mean to tell me that she has memories of her father but not his family? That the first black person she met was a girl in elementary school? Okay. Sidenote Evelyn just randomly dropping that she supported civil rights and MLK Jr towards the end of the book felt totally out of place and while not a big deal that part of the book felt very disconnected from what else was going on.I didn't feel attached to any of the characters really, let alone any of the seven husbands. I have ones I thought were more interesting, but that's only because so did TJR and they were the ones given more time on the page. None of the characters that appear in the novel though are nearly as developed as Evelyn Hugo, something that I think makes it easier for a reader to be drawn to. There is literally no one else. No one is given the time or energy, even the major players in her life. I didn't think that the love story between Evelyn and the person that would be the lover her life was all that compelling if anything I thought that that person was actually lowkey terrible and the romance they shared was almost certainly nothing to write home about.There are a number of deaths in this book, and again, didn't care about any of them.At the end of the day though I did enjoy the voice of Evelyn Hugo, the character to be clear. Though the most revolutionary thing about her is being a bisexual character in their 70s, there's just something about characters like Evelyn that I will always support and that's no different here. Again though it helps that Evelyn is easily the only character crafted with any kind of depth.I can't in good faith recommend that anyone read this book. I got very little enjoyment, but also there is nothing to gain? I realize and appreciate that my thoughts are in the minority here and I in no way feel like my opinion will ever be the one most agree with. If you do decide to pick this up I hope that you are able to enjoy it in ways I couldn't.Also just a warning but this book details incestuous thoughts of child sexual assault, actual child sexual assault/pedophilia, and abuse in general [ definitely physical, emotional up for discussion I'd say ] so just know that if you want to pick this up.2022 re-read thoughtsI wish that I could say that I liked this more the second time, but that would be a lie...Or at least, partly a lie. I don't think that I can raise the rating even if I objectively had a better time reading it knowing the full scope of the story I was going to be getting. Maybe the gut punch of the end of the book being so insensitive being taken out of the equation was enough for me to have a better time, I don't know.I do think that there are elements that work well here. I still think that Evelyn is an interesting character to follow with a very distinctive voice that I would appreciate in the hands of any other author. I feel comfortable saying that because I have enjoyed many a character that share her achetype.For me the ways that race were handled poorly weren't so glaringly annoying this time as much as Celia being a horrible character. From the microaggressions at the first time she and Evelyn have a meal together to the way that she acts for years toward Evelyn. It never comes across as a 'good for her' moment, her standing up for herself... but as shaming Evelyn for doing things that she herself is not doing? Shaming Evelyn for making choices that are good for both of them. I get that communication is hard... but Celia and Evelyn take this to a whole new level. It was childish. It didn't serve love of her life... It didn't serve the one that got away. I deserved better as a reader quite frankly.All of that is to say that the book giving 20ish pages to the explanation as to why Monique was chosen for this opportunity... still by far the worst part of the book. Everything about that getting wrapped up is so rushed. While the whole book feels very surface level, that in particular is damn near unforgivable. Monique deserved better as a character, the readers deserves more, and that TJR thought it was acceptable is pure foolishness.I still think everyone who has wanted to read this has read it at this point... But it really shouldn't be on anyone's tbr. It's definitely not worth the time, even with all the potential this story has.""}]"

But they have also come to Antica for another purpose: to seek healing at the famed Torre Cesme for the wounds Chaol received in Rifthold.After enduring unspeakable horrors as a child, Yrene Towers has no desire to help the young lord from Adarlan, let alone heal him. Yet she has sworn an oath to assist those in need—and will honor it. But Lord Westfall carries shadows from his own past, and Yrene soon comes to realize they could engulf them both.In this sweeping parallel novel to theNew York TimesbestsellingEmpire of Storms, Chaol, Nesryn, and Yrene will have to draw on every scrap of their resilience if they wish to save their friends. But while they become entangled in the political webs of the khaganate, deep in the shadows of mighty mountains where warriors soar on legendary ruks, long-awaited answers slumber. Answers that might offer their world a chance at survival—or doom them all . . .","[{'rating': 2, 'content': '""With you gone, my lord, I... I took the night to visit my parents.""[Chaol] tried not to cringe. A family. [Kadja] had family here, and he\'d never bothered to ask--You may as well pick up your bows and your quivers, because being shot in the vagina with a poisoned arrow would probably be less painful than readingone more pageof Chaol\'s Boring Journey to God Knows Where with Fuck Knows Who doing Who Fucking Cares. Bonus points for the chapters, many of which I skimmed like no woman has ever skimmed before, detailing Nesryn\'s Boring Journey to Some Fucking Mountains with Some Dude and The Spider I Vacuumed Up Last Week.Honest to god, guys, this book was so boring I nearly died reading it. The hell happened? I\'m hardly the biggest fan of the one with Feyre and Rhysand and all of their strange chiseled friends, but at least it held my attention. I low key went into cardiac arrest trying to get through this. The kicker is this: bothEmpire of StormsandTower of Dawnwere boring and full of fillers. The obvious solution should have been to smoosh them together into one book, but... $$$ I guess. That\'s just kind of sad.The basic premise is this: Chaol goes to Antica to rally support for Aelin. Okay, so we can work with that. But what we ended up with was just loads of stuff just straight up stolen from Game of Thrones! I mean, come on - Chaol is Hand of the King! Hand of the King is a title invented by George R. R. Martin. ""Hand of the King"" was never a title held by any historical figure. It\'s literally just stolen. There\'s no getting away from it.Before this book, I actually really liked Chaol. I also sympathised with him, given that everyone took him for granted, and he went so far above his pay grade it\'s not even funny, just to be scorned by all and sundry for running away when an actual demon was trying to shear him in half with otherworldly magic. I still don\'t get why everyone has this weird attitude to him but I banged on about that for long enough in my review ofQueen of Shadowsso I won\'t bore you all with it now.AfterTower of Dawn, I\'m not sick of Chaol for the same reasons that most people attest to: I\'ve heard a lot of folk saying they hate him now because of the way he treated Nesryn. Nesryn dumped him via a note - actually, nah. I bet it was really a napkin, just thrown down on his dresser. Literally justCho, I\'m sick of you, don\'t call me, kthxbyeand that\'s that. That\'s like Ye Olde Break Up Text. Truth be told, they were barely together to begin with. But that\'s not even the crux of the matter: I just hate Nesryn because she\'s so boring. Words can\'t even explain how little I care about her. She could have made like me the first 637658386 times I played Minecraft and tried to dig straight down (don\'t do that!!!!) and ended up in a lava pit, and I wouldn\'t have given a tiny rat\'s ass. I cared even less about her than I did about that bit at the beginning of Fallout, when you have to pretend to be devastated that your wife got shot and your baby got kidnapped, when really you\'re just waiting with bated breath to charge into battle #mwi on chems and make sweet gay love to that hot creep Hancock (there\'s no wrong way to play!).Speaking of gay... I thought Chaol was queer? Did no one else think that? See, this is another missed opportunity. There\'s Hasar and Renia, though Hasar is a total arsehole and Renia is this weird wet rag of a character who keeps being referred to ickily as Hasar\'s ""lover"". I was feeling it between Chaol and Shen more than I ever felt it between Chaol and Yrene, and this is the problem with SJM: she has this weird ability to unknowingly write pairings with great chemistry, most of which are non-hetero, and then blow a big dumb hole right through it with the same enemies-to-lovers straight romance that we\'ve seen six trillion times before. I always felt that Yrene\'s story was the least interesting part ofThe Assassin\'s Blade, and now I\'ve got to sit here and pretend to buy her romance with Chaol? Are you trifling with this?So one of the biggest problems I had with this book was Yrene, and not because she\'s the same crap character that we\'ve seen a thousand times before - I\'ve come to expect that. The worst part was that she is theshittest healer ever. The most unprofessional, the most rude, the most entitled. I have a high tolerance for fuckery, especially with high fantasy, but the scene where she allowed those little bitches to tear Chaol down off his horse and then trot him out like a wooden doll, as if, as a disabled person, he\'s just a thing to be toyed with, turned my fucking stomach. Then, after this, the Healer on High wafts over to Chaol with a sickly wee smile on her face and says, ""Welp, that\'s our Yrene. Don\'t be mean to her. She\'s had a hard life."" Fuck that. Fuck all of them, for treating Chaol in that way. It was disgusting. And then they have a little argument about it, and it\'s all forgotten about. Seriously? No. I literally couldn\'t stop thinking about that. We keep being told that Yrene is so talented and amazing and the next heir to the Torre Cesme, and yet she is still at the stage where she\'s treating her patients like this? Where the hell is her bedside manner?(I\'m also pretty pissed off about Chaol being healed in the end, and the cop-out with the life bond to Yrene, but that\'s a given. Why we can\'t just have a handsome male character with a rounded story arc who is just straight up in a wheelchair, disabled, is a mystery to me. There is no reason why Chaol needed to be magically healed. I\'m so sick of this cast of Olympians with their rippling muscles and their perfect swordplay, and this is another reason why it\'s relevant to note Game of Thrones: it has its issues with representation, absolutely, but it is notable in its portrayal of multiple well-rounded and layered disabled characters.)The trouble is that the setting of Antica was cool...but derivative. The idea was good...but executed badly. This book was full of good ideas that went down the toilet, and I\'m kind of pissed off about it, because this is the sixth book, and it certainly wasn\'t cheap, but it\'s not the money I\'m bitter about. It\'s the fact that I\'ve committed to this series and these characters, and SJM won\'t stop butchering them. Not to sound like Disgrunted 4chan Fan #67546453, but how is that fair? Don\'t build up fans\' expectations, then then disrespect the first three (excellent) books in the series with this piece of nonsense.FIN'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""1.)Throne of Glass★★2.)Crown of Midnight★★★★.5)The Assassin's Blade★★★3.)Heir of Fire★★★★4.)Queen of Shadows★★★★━━♡tandem readalongsideEmpire of Storms[2024 reread]★★★★“The heart he’d offered and had been left to drop on the wooden planks of the river docks. An assassin who had sailed away and a queen who had returned.”first and foremost: tandem read thoughts! truly, i wholeheartedly recommend tandem reading these two books! it truly elevated the reading experience to a whole different level. it truly creates the perfect push and pull for the reader, that will always make you not want to put down the current book, while simultaneously have you ravenous to pick up the other book. i hope the person who came up with that breakdown always has a cool or warm pillow, depending on their desired preference.okay, actually review - you all knew ten years ago that chaol was one of my favorite characters in this whole sjm universe, and a whole decade later i am still here singing his praises. His archetype is one that i just very much like to read, especially in romance, and now that i am thinking about it, maybe he is the reason i extra like it. but having a full book seeing him heal (both mentally and physically) and find the love he deserves? i just love it and i fear i am always going to love it. and additionally to loving the captain of the guard / body guard archetype, i also am obsessed with a magical healer character archetype too - so this really is a recipe to success for my reading wheelhouse.back in the day, i wrote an ungodly long review for this! So in the 2024 version, let me just say some of my favorite things. first (and i know i sound like such a broken record at this point), sarah really laying that groundwork for yrene withthe assassin's blade, is just so impressive to me. and her slowly figuring out who the assassin was who changed her life was just so heartwarming. and seeing how chaol talks about aelin, and how much he believes in her, just… we really do love to read it. screaming at him saying she would never go back to skull’s bay while i am tandem reading about her in skull’s bay lol.i loved the murder mystery storyline, and i feel like the atmosphere in the tower was just 11/10 perfection.i am not the reviewer you should be going to for disability representation opinion, but i personally really did like chaol’s journey. i think there was a lot of good things in this story with him using a wheelchair. from small discussions of toxic masculinity and ableism, to learning to just do things differently, and that not being a lesser way to do something - from battle training to sex.also, i completely forgot about the story line with lysandra's uncle, falkan. but i feel like i am extra in love with lysandra this reread, and it was making me shed so many tears. like, that’s MY family hahaha.i also feel like, back in the day, i didn't appreciate nesryn and her coming home in this story the way that i did this time around. and realizing how much she missed not only her family, but her culture and customs and language - it was really beautiful, and made me so emotional at times. and i really loved seeing her navigate where she came from, where she was forced to go, and where she wants to be - unapologetically. her and sartaq deserve the world, actually, and them really finding out the big bad of this story was so cool (and so integral to what happens)!overall, i really am loving this reread and i just understand more and more why sjm and her universe is still the most popular fantasy, a decade later.trigger + content warnings:slavery, talk of illness, loss of a loved one (family members), loss of a child, death, murder, a medical scare involving a pregnant person (ends up being okay), grief, talk of suicide (ends up not being the cause of death), so much talk of medicine and healing, ptsd, blood, talk of abuse, spiders, talk of threat of sa in past, hurt animal companion (bird / really big rooks), and maybe grey area cheating (to me, personally, it never felt bad/wrong, but maybe for other readers it would)[2017 first read]★★★★★♡old review on my blogblog|instagram|youtube|kofi|spotify|amazon1.)A Court of Thorns and Roses★★★★2.)A Court of Mist and Fury★★★3.)A Court of Wings and Ruin★★★3.1)A Court of Frost and Starlight★★★4)A \u200bCourt of Silver Flames★★★★1.)House of Earth and Blood★★★2.)House of Sky and Breath★★★3.)House of Flame and Shadow★★★""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""5/5 ⭐Full review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolf🐺EoS:*ended with a MASSIVE cliffhanger*me:I NEED ANSWERSSJM:*writing ToD*I’m actually not complaining, I’m just a frustratedhumanreader. You cannot blame me for that, I’m sure you can relate.I am, in fact, really happy and I feel super#blessedbecause of this beautiful book.To be honest, this book was not a fresh gulp of air. No. At least, this isn’t how I felt about it. It was more like a warm and spicy oriental evening, filled with exotic music at every corner and strong smells of cardamom coffee.Basically, the rest of the series is like your daily routine and this book is like a winter holiday spent in Dubai.Lush.The great thing about the whole book is that my baby Chaol got a chance to prove himself worthy of love and affection. At the beginning of the series I used to love Chaol, then he somehow got lost in all that plot and at parts, I found him boring. But this book was created for me to fall in love with him all over again. He’s a good lad and he’s been through a lot of things. I say he deserves every single good thing that’s going to happen to him!In this book particularly, the best thing happening to him is the cutie-pie Yrene. He searches the Southern Continent for allies in the battle against the darkness and he finds himself a badass fox-eyed girl – I think the lad has hit the jackpot at this point in his life.I actually love their relationship and apparently, SJM really has this amazing (and annoying) talent of always finding the best matches for her characters, despite the occasional flirt here and there. She really did well with this pair too. She is the real goddess of love, fight me if I’m wrong.I love Yrene.I really do.She’s a very sweet girl, witty and determined and her sense of independence tangled with her need to help others transform her in a veritable human being – as veritable as the ones in real life aren’t.“Remember all that you promised to do. To be.”She’s selfless. She allows herself to be this way by not allowing her to be self-centred. But she’s also fearless. Strong. Independent. Determined. She spreads her knowledge. She teaches young girls to defend themselves. She’s a true warrior. I love that about her. And I love the fact that she repeats that to herself. So to remember.Okay now. Does anyone remember Nesryn Faliq, the most badass Captain of the Guard Adarlan has ever had? (Sorry Chaol baby but I’m only speaking facts).I do remember her. And I do love her now more than ever.This book was the perfect chance for the world to see the real Nesryn Faliq – the woman beneath the uniform. The girl beyond the fighter.She is truly amazing. She gives off this vibe of the girl used to giving so much but to receive so little that it doesn’t even bother her anymore. But it does. She’s used to not being good enough for anyone. And she suffers deeply about that. Nesryn is good enough. Nesryn is beyond. And the sweet, delicious shameless flirt that Prince Sartaq is, totally sees that. And lets her see that too.“I loved you before I ever set eyes on you.”I do feel like Nesyn and Sartaq are the endings of each other’s story and, honestly now, isn’t that so beautiful you want to cry your eyes out??One more important aspect that I'd like to discuss is, like in all of the other books from the series, the beauty of women helping women.“A gift from a queen who had seen another woman in hell and thought to reach back a hand.”Every book has its own hidden motif. One important quality of humanity. In this particular book, that motif is represented by kindness.Kindness must be there, everywhere where is or might be needed. No matter who or what you are, this could make a deadly difference in life. Thank you, Sarah J. Maas for always teaching as something!""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Eh. It was all right. But it\'s kind of hard to tear apart the personality of a beloved character, turn them into someone whiny and bland, then try to create a whole 672-page book out of their perspective. It wasn\'t awful, butmany parts were boring.I overlook a lot when it comes to Maas. The poor representation of marginalized characters, the frankly creepy obsession with ""manhood"" and ""maleness"", the nauseating and repeated descriptions of characters\' beauty... but here I thought the story really lacked something. You can sumTower of Dawnup asan overlong healing process with a love story. The romance is predictable, and I\'ll spoiler tag it but it should come as a surprise to no one that Chaolmagically recovers from the disability that put him in a wheelchair.The events of this book occur alongside the events ofEmpire of Storms, filling in the blanks of Chaol\'s adventures on the Southern continent. Chaol goes to appeal to the rulers and healers of Antica - for the former to ally with Dorian, and the latter to heal him and help him walk again. Though the powerful healer - Yrene - seems to hate Chaol at first, we know this is a Maas book, so he can only be shirtless so long before she starts falling for him.A subplot emerges with healers being murdered in crimes that look suspiciously like the actions of the Valg, and yet from the beginning through to the very end of this looonnnggg book, it felt like what it was: a mere distraction between the Chaol and Yrene love/hate flirtations. As the book drew to a close, it was easy to see thatTower of Dawnexisted for the sole purpose of creating a new love interest for Chaol and getting him back on his feet. Literally.Perhaps this wasa case of poor timing; perhaps there was just less tension knowing the last book left us chronologically after the end of this book\'s events. We\'re reading in the past withTower of DawnwhenEmpire of Stormsleft us on such a delicious high, wanting to know what would happen to Aelin. I think it was a bad decision to insert Chaol\'s 600+ page perspective here, right when Maas has us on an emotional hook. I feel like by the time the next book rolls around, excitement and tension over Aelin\'s predicament will have waned for me.Maas has responded to readers, or so it seems, by creating more diverse characters in this book. Many of the secondary characters are POC, and a major side character is queer. Though she still seems genuinely clueless when handling interactions between them, putting emphasis on Yrene\'s shock when Chaol smiles at the female healers AND *gasp* the male guards. Oh my, gay people! How crazy! And that\'s not even saying anything about the way Chaol\'s disability is handled...Mostly,it just wasn\'t that fun. Either Chaol and Yrene were predictably ogling each other, or else Chaol was concentrating on wiggling his big toe like he\'s the less badass version of Beatrix Kiddo. It would be more fun if we turned it into a drinking game:Drink every time Chaol’s “manhood” is mentioned.Drink every time Chaol’s eyes ""smolder"".But, alas, I am pregnant and therefore disappointingly sober.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""chaol is and always be my favourite character in this series. no one is more deserving of having such in-depth character development, redemption, and healing. i cant think of a better character for the readers to go on such an emotional journey with. it makes me so unbelievably happy to once again see him happy. <3also, this exchange will forever give me life.'using the chair is not a punishment. it is not a prison,' he said softly. 'i am as much of a man in that chair, or with that cane, as i am standing on my feet.''i wanted to heal you,' she breathed.'you did,' he said, smiling. 'yrene, in every way that truly matters... you did.'ughh. im not crying. you are. :')_____________________________okay. as someone who has made it pretty obvious how much i dislike the covers of this series,WHYon earth am i so frustrated that this one doesnt match?!??! i mean, WHO EVEN AM I???!?identity crisis aside, this book is so good. it is so different from the rest of the series, but i love that. it is so refreshing. also, its an unpopular opinion, i know, but i always have and always will love chaol. he has been my favourite since the very beginning and i will stand by him through thick and thin, at his best and at his worst (yeah, i see you guys coming for him during‘queen of shadows’- not on my watch!). he is such a complex character - flawed, but also redeemable. and so its about time he got a book of his own. i missed him so much in‘empire of storms,’so this totally makes up for his long absence.in true SJM fashion, this delivers on the storytelling, the writing, the plot development, and the phenomenal characters. i love how this is completely separate from the main series, but also tied in so well, giving the reader much needed information. i cant wait to see how what happens in this book will incorporate with everything else that has been going on in the series. but one thing is for sure, its about to all go down and none of us will make it out alive.↠5 stars""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I bow down to Sarah J Maas’ storytelling. I have not liked Chaol since the second half of the Crown of Midnight. Also, with the last book finishing with Aelin ending in such a precarious position, I personally did not want to weigh an extra year to find out what happened to her.However, SJM knows that every issue I had with Chaol was addressed in this book. Also, if this book had come out after the next final book, this story would have had the prequel curse where I would have known everything that was going to happen.I admit I was thinking about Aelin through this book, so I was glad to see her make appearances (only as mentions throughout). This is a great story tying up threads from former books and novellas. I think the “nothing is coincidence” is featured and shown perfectly in this book.This is a great story about redemption, character development/growth, using leftover bits from the other stories to make a great story, and characters finding their own place. Once again it the it is a great credit to SJM’s storytelling skills that she wrote such a great book essentially just the side characters, and made them shine. Especially Nesryn, who definitely deserved better than just being Chaol’s backup (in more ways than one). There is also a great description of the mental injury recovery and how much of the process is mental. Anger, frustration, and guilt can be as detrimental to a person’s recovery as the cause of the physical injury itself.As much as I hate to admit it, these characters would not have had a chance to shine like this if Aelin was in this book. If possible, this book has increased my anticipation for the next book even more. I can’t wait for the final book of this great series. I am expecting all out WAR and one hell of a retribution beat down to all the Vargs.'}, {'rating': None, 'content': 'You could never make me hate Chaol Westfall.If Chaol has no fans then i am dead!'}, {'rating': None, 'content': '*happy dance because i loved this when i thought i was gonna hate it*'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3.5!!!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'the world’s biggest Chaol defender has just risen from the ashes and it’s me'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3.75 stars!!

It's always a little amazing when you read about characters, people, overcoming certain obstacles, whether that's internal or external. In this case, it was both for Chaol. Even though, this book follows 3 other characters, it's Chaol's story at its core.His emotional journey was very much needed. From pure self-loathing to healing. From having lost his purpose to finding something much better than what he originally had. From being lost to being found. You know. All that lovely human crap.And that ending! 😭 I’m so happy he’s found himself again. And Yrene.I’m emo.This book was sobrown, and so enjoyable to read. I love this series with my soul.——————————GODDAMN THIS WAS EPIC! 😭Thanks to my babeLenafor making this reading experience extra amazing! Always going to have fond memories attached to it now! <3I just want to curl up in a ball, stay in a cave somewhere till the last book comes out. Last page? Sadistic move! 😩There's so much that's happening in this overall story of Aelin and her court! (I get so psyched when I say that!) So much that needs resolving and I don't know how Sarah J Maas will wrap it up. Especially with the new revelations that were brought to light.One thing I can rely on though is that Sarah J Maas will deliver.Chaol as a character since the beginning of this series has been one of my favourites. Before my obsession with Rowan or Aelin or Dorian even. He was the one I instantly warmed to and cared for. And his overall character arc from book one till now has been an incredible to follow. I adore him!I can't wait to see the role each character will play in the final book.This series safely sits alongside my Potter collection as one of my all-time favourite series.With regards to the Valg, anyone else think they represent the Dementors and Yrene's powers as the Patronus Charm, since the way people can get healed from the Valg is attacking it with a happy memory? With a healer’s light and magic? I just loved that aspect! A lot!""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Edit: Will my book slump ever go away? Maybe. Perhaps. Slow progress. But this book was a step in the right direction. Loved this with all my heart and couldn’t stop reading. Maas, again, applause for you.(Don’t know if I’ll have a review for this one. I hate to promise and not provide and life is hectic. I just stress myself a lot about it, hope you don’t mind. But this one is highly, highly recommended!)***Never been on Team Chaol. My precious cinnamon roll, Dorian Havilliard, stole my heart from the beginning. But I've always wondered:HOW ON EARTH CAN ANYONE NOT LOVE CHAOL?!?!Not for his relationship with Celaena, but just for who he is. Selfless, loyal, kind, courageous. I don't know about you, but the fact that he lost his shit in QoS (which was acceptable since he went againsteverythinghe believed in his whole life), the fact that he was flawed like any other human being only brought him closer to perfection.So, no. I'm not sad that we get his book instead of the final novel. He deserves the recognition. SJM described this book as HoF (my favorite ToG installment) but for Chaol. It's gonna be a journey of healing and revelations and finding yourself again. PLUS THE SOUTHERN CONTINENT OMG. Plus Yrene Towers!! And NESRYN. It's gonna be amazing.SEPTEMBER CANNOT ARRIVE FAST ENOUGH.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""This was a great read, I just think it was waaaay too long and not really entirely necessary.

Come to think of it, all my favorite characters in this series were introduced from the third book onwards. And the world building here is next level compared to all previous installments. There was a heavy Tolkien vibe throughout this book which I loved despite the irritatingly slower pace.""Long ago, in another world, another lifetime, there existed a land of dark, and cold, and wind.""I don\'t know when the novella about Yrene was originally released, but ever since I came across her in Assassin\'s Blade, I was wondering how she would fit into things. It only became clear at the end of fourth book, when Chaol was dispatched to the southern continent, that we might encounter her again. But I did not expect for Maas to create such a vital, and interesting character out of her like this, who, from the looks of it, going to play a major role in the last book. The healer\'s plot line more or less takes over that of Chaols, and manages to control more than half of the book here, while Nesryn relating her own separate journey.""The world needs more healers.""The obvious weakness in this book is it\'s relatively slower pace. Maas had been gradually increasing the pace until that last (fifth) book, and in my opinion, Tower of Dawn disturbed that flow. This might have been great for a first book in a series, where the readers would be looking for a lot of detailed world building, but not in a penultimate book. I only refrained from skimming through some of the chapters because I was worried if I miss anything vital to the last book. But to be honest, it was an tiring effort. May be this might\'ve worked out a little better if the book was positioned before Empire of Storm. The unforgiving pace set by the fifth book made this appear completely out of place.""I am not particularly skilled with heights.""However, the plot did put a lot of missing links in proper place at last, including some major ones. Though, I\'m not fully convinced if these revelations required such a long book. But at least it was nice to have Chaol back. It\'s finally time to begin the ending.""True wealth is not all glittering gold and jewels.""'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '”There are choices in my past,” he said tightly, “that I have come to regret. But I can only move on – and attempt to fix them. Fight to make sure they do not occur again.”Where do I even start with this review?It was different. Different than all the books that came before because the pacing wasn’t as fast as in the former books and Sarah actually took her time to support the development of her characters and the plot. I know some people might think that an entire book about Chaol would be boring or that such a slow pacing would be detrimental for the overall storyline of the series but for me it wasn’t! Quite the contrary!I think this book was necessary and needed and if you didn’t read“Tower of Dawn”because you don’t like Chaol and think you can ignore his story, it’s your choice, but I think you’re missing out on a lot of fun and important information that is vital to understand the events in“Kingdom of Ash”. ;-)Yes, this is a book about healing and recovering from injuries, it’s a book about guilt and redemption, it’s a story about a broken man who fights his way back into life, it’s about acknowledging the darkness that lives within all of us and about embracing it in order to learn how to move on. It’s about acceptance! Acceptance of the past, the present, the future, about recognizing your fears and faults, about making amends, but most of all it’s a story about a man who fights his inner demons and learns to love himself.It’s one of the most beautiful stories I’ve read so far and even though the slow burns and pacing killed me I can still say that it fit the atmosphere of the book perfectly. This was a harmonious masterpiece and I can only speak for myself but from me Sarah gets all the stars and even more!!! <333I loved this and thoroughly enjoyed it and I hope many other people will read and love it too! =))The Characters:You are now entering my “Spoilery Spoiler Section” and if you want to be spoiled take a seat, grab something to eat and drink and enjoy another one of my endless ToG essays. *lol* If you haven’t read this book yet and plan to dive into it soon you better leg it though. XD Consider yourself warned! ;-PChaol:”Lord Chaol Westfall, Hand of the King.He hated it. More than the sound of wheels. More than the body he now could not feel beneath his hips, the body whose stillness still surprised him, even after all these weeks later.He was Lord of Nothing, Lord of Oath-Breakers. Lord of Liars.”Oh Chaol!!! How much I suffered with him throughout the course of this entire book!!! He was so broken and loathed himself so much. To read his POV was more than just painful and to see how all his actions gnawed on him made me infinitely sad. He was practically flagellating himself and his self-hatred knew no boundaries. >_< This poor, poor man!!! Trapped in a broken body and left with a shattered soul. There were so many things he never worked through and if you ask me, it was about time he confronted his inner demons. (Quite literally I may add) And boy how he did it!I AM SO DAMN PROUD OF MY BOY!!! I CAN’T EVEN PUT IT INTO WORDS!!!Chaol’s journey was worth every second of my time! I finally saw the boy I liked so much in those first two books and it was so good to have him back again! To see his journey, to see how he grew in this book, how he accepted his mistakes and learned from them, how he became a stronger person! Gosh, this was everything I ever wanted and more! <3 Hands down one of the best character arcs I ever had the pleasure to read about! =)) Thank you Queen Maas!!! *bows*”A man used to being obeyed, yes, but a man also inclined to care for others. Look after them. Driven to do it by a compulsion he couldn’t leash, couldn’t train out of him. Couldn’t have broken out of him.””He’d been sinking and drowning since. Long before his spine.He wasn’t certain if he’d even tried to swim. Not since that sword had gone into the river. Not since he’d left Dorian in that room with his father and told his friend – his brother – that he loved him, and knew it was good-bye. He’d … left. In every sense of the word.””A body on a bed. A dagger poised above his heart. A head rolling on stone. A collar around a neck. A sword sinking to the bottom of the Avery.””Life. He had life to savor, to fight for.And the breaking that had started and ended here … Yes, it belonged to him. He was allowed to break, so that this forging might begin.So that he might begin again.”Yrene:”The day I reached these shores, I cast aside that girl. And I will be damned if I let her reemerge. Or let someone tell me what to do with my life, my choices again.”Haha! Boy, was I angry at Yrene!!! That horrible behaviour!! *lol* Seriously, the way she treated Chaol at the beginning of the book was so appalling! I mean I understand why she did it and why she hated him so much, but she didn’t even know him and never even gave him the benefit of the doubt. So I was basically bristling with indignation when she treated him that bad. XD Once she started to heal him she realized how wrong she was though and to see how she started to care for Chaol, how she realized that he was a good man. Well, let’s just say it was worth all the trouble they had at the beginning. ;-P Plus I loved that Yrene was so stubborn and headstrong and that she never backed down! That woman had guts! *lol* Especially when she threw Hasar into the water because she insulted Chaol. It takes quite some courage to go to such lengths and if there is one thing Yrene has in abundance then it’s certainly bravery. XDNesryn:”So she’d figured it was better to remain, to be passed over, not for mere pay, but for the fact that there were so few other guards like her, helping those who needed it most. It was for them she stayed on, kept her head down while lesser men were appointed.”And here I go with another woman that received my anger at the beginning of the book. *lol* Once again I understand why Nesryn acted the way she did and decided to leave with Sartaq, but damn did it bother me that she didn’t even tell Chaol in person. Yes, they had to leave quickly and were pressed for time, but still. She basically left him to deal with this huge pile of crap and that poor boy was already unable to cope with anything that happened. She should have known better than that and shouldn’t have left him to his own devices. Promises or not this was a shitty move and she knew it. ;-) Despite all that I still like her though. I mean Nesryn is a woman who’s self-confident and knows her weaknesses and strengths. She’s comfortable in her own skin and goes her own way. I have to admire that even though it made me angry at the beginning. *lol*Sartaq:”There is beauty in my father’s lands,” the prince went on while Kadara ripped into that monstrous carcass, “but there is much lurking beneath the surface, too.”I LOVE SARTAQ!!!Of all the new characters that were introduced in this book this man definitely was the best!!! GAH! I don’t even know where to start! I loved everything about him! I mean he’s the khagan’s son and he’s a ruk rider and he’s charming, funny, sweet, eloquent, down-to-earth and never hesitates to voice his opinion. He is so honest, honourable, compassionate, caring, courageous and attentive it’s impossible not to love him. <333 Of all the khagan’s children I liked him the most and this right from the very first page he was introduced. XD I really hope we’ll see more of him in “Kingdom of Ash” and I can’t wait to see how all the other characters are going to react to him! =))”I am sorry – for your loss. As long ago as it was. I … As a warrior, I grew up walking hand-in-hand with Death. And yet this one … It has been harder to endure than others. And my mother’s grief perhaps even harder to face than my own.”Hasar:”Hasar was many things, but she was loyal. To her core. To the few, few people whom she favoured. It had always warmed something in Yrene. To have someone who actually meant what they said. Hasar would behead the killer if they were unfortunate to encounter her. She would ask no questions, either.”I still don’t know if I should like her or if I should dislike her. *lol* On the one hand I admired her brutal honesty and ruthlessness but on the other hand I didn’t like her attitude towards Chaol and Nesryn. Well, truth be told, even towards Yrene. I mean Yrene is her best friend, yet she didn’t even hesitate to use her in order to get some information from Chaol. She didn’t care if her best friend felt threatened by her and she didn’t give a damn about Yrene’s feelings when she basically forced her on Chaol. Right after the motto: The end justifies the means. She seems to be an intriguing character but I didn’t see all too much of her so I’m still undecided. Mhmm… maybe KoA will help me to get to know her better? =)The relationships and ships:Yrene & Chaol:”So you may look at me with resentment Yrene Towers, and I will not blame you for it. But believe me when I say that there is no one in Erilea who loathes me more than I do myself.”To say those two had a bad start would be putting it more than just mildly! *LOL* They were at each other’s throat right from the moment Yrene walked into Chaol’s room, but they both had to go a long way and it was so nice to see them grow. Not just character-wise but also in the sense of growing together. I think that describes it really well. Over time their initial distrust turned into hesitant acceptance, a solid friendship and then into something more. And I LIVE for relationships like that! <333 Those two were so amazing together and there were so many moments that caused me to gasp. For instance the intense scene at the dinner party of the khagan’s children! I swear the air was burning between them! And the moment when Yrene coaxed him into walking towards her? Gosh, such a beautiful chapter and so typical for Chaol. He only started to walk because he wanted to apologize to her. *shakes head* Sweet boy! I have to admit that the ending kind of threw me though. I mean he went all this way, Yrene healed him fully and then he gave his life for her and once again was almost killed in the process. It’s just not fair that he had to suffer again, that he’ll suffer for the rest of his life now that Yrene made that deal with the goddess, but it still … idk it fits?! Their lives are connected now, not just by their love but also by the bond that was forged when Yrene saved him. And considering how deep their love is, this is kind of perfect and suitable? I mean, they probably couldn’t imagine a life without each other anyway so I guess it’s good they are tethered to each other? *lol* I’m making no sense, but I hope everyone who read this book knows what I mean! XD And I really, really, really hope they’ll both survive KoA! >_<”Everything I thought, everything I had planned and wanted … It’s gone. All I have left is my king, and this ridiculous, slim scrap of hope that we survive this war and I can find a way to make something of it.”“Of what?”“Of everything that crumbled in my hands. Everything.””I don’t share a bed with patients. And you’re with Captain Faliq,” she added quickly. “And you’re –““Not in fit form to pleasure a woman?”He was shocked he said it. But again more than a tad smug to see her eyes flare.“No,” Yrene said, somehow going redder. “Certainly not that. But you’re… you.”“I’m trying not to be insulted.”Yet Yrene wrapped her arms around herself and said, “I feel safer here.”Chaol tried not to blink at her. At the words.With him. She felt safer here with him.”He didn’t understand – how she could be so delicate, so small, when she had overturned his life entirely. Worked miracles with those hands and that soul, this woman who had crossed mountains and seas.”Nesryn & Sartaq:”After last night’s party, I had thought you would be … preoccupied.”With Chaol. Her brows rose. “All day?”The prince gave her a roguish smile, finishing off his long braid and picking up his spear once more. “I certainly would take all day.”BLESS SARTAQ and his unapologetic flirting!!! *lol* I loved him so much and it was so funny to see self-confident Nesryn blush! Those two killed me! Throughout the entire book I may add! GAH! I swear I rarely came across such a slow burn (the only other example that instantly comes to mind is “The Raven Cycle”) and up until almost the last page I was like:“KISS GODDAMIT!! KISS!!! WHY WON’T YOU FINALLY KISS??!!! ADKASDLFSJAJKLMNÖ!”I swear, I was constantly complaining to Gem about them not even holding hands (Thank you for enduring my rants btw! *lol*) and I couldn’t believe that Sarah actually went for such a slow burn! XD I mean when I think about EoS… well you get the idea. Haha! Anyway, those two were so cute together, especially Sartaq, that I just wanted this ship to sail. Badly! And OMG was it a relief when they FINALLY kissed in the end! I hope they’ll have a few tender moments in KoA as well and that this isn’t all we get because ARGH I might actually die if a chaste kiss is everything they are going for. Look at me complaining about all those sexy scenes in EoS and now begging for some with Sartaq and Nesryn. *lmao* Sarah, you clearly messed me up big time… *shakes head*”It took her another minute to stop trembling. Sartaq patiently waited, stroking her hair, fingers rippling over the ridges of Borte’s braid. She let him, leaned into the touch while she studied the gap they’d now have to jump, the stairs still beyond.””But even as the night moved on, as Nesryn sang in that beautiful mountain-hall, she felt Sartaq’s stare. Different from any he’d given before. And though she told herself she should, Nesryn did not look away.”Sartaq smiled at her – gently. Sweetly. In a way she had not yet seen.“I loved you before I even set eyes on you,” he said.“Please,” Nesryn wept.Sartaq’s hand tightened on hers. “I wish we’d had time.”Nesryn left her body. Could only manage to breathe.And when she tried to bow, Sartaq gripped her shoulders tightly. Stopped her before her head could even lower. “Never from you,” he said quietly.Dorian & Chaol:”Even as boys, I knew he was not his father’s son. I knew a better future lay with him, if I could make sure Dorian lived long enough. If he not only lived, but also survived – emotionally. If he had an ally, a true friend, in that court of vipers. Neither of us was old enough, strong enough to challenge his father. We saw what happened to those who whispered of rebellion. I knew that if I, if he set one foot out of line, his father would kill him, heir or no. So I craved the stability, the safety of the status quo.”Those moments when Chaol thought about Dorian were the death of me. So much pain on both sides and Dorian never even blamed Chaol for leaving him in the castle. I can’t wait until those two are reunited again and I’m sure I’ll cry like a baby when they face each other after everything that happened. I just want them to hug and to be happy! <333 This friendship survived so much, I hope it will survive that final war too! They deserve it! *sobs* T_T”I don’t know. He is free – he is alive. But is he fine? He suffered. Greatly. In ways I can’t begin to…” His throat tightened to the point of pain. “It should have been me. I had always planned for it to be me instead.”Aelin & Chaol:”Chaol?”For wherever you need to go – and then some. The world needs more healers.There, in her handwriting…Chaol looked up at last, blinking away tears as he scanned his wife’s face. Every beautiful line, those golden eyes.A gift.A gift from a queen who had seen another woman in hell and thought to reach back a hand. With no thought of it ever being returned. A moment of kindness, a tug on a thread…THIS MOMENT!!!I cried so freaking much when Chaol discovered that Aelin was the woman who helped Yrene all those years ago. This scene was so moving I’m having tears in my eyes just thinking about it. Precious Chaol crying. T_T Ahh, I swear there are so many different feels when I think about this revelation and they make me a crying mess, so I better stop talking about them now. XDAll told, I enjoyed this book even more than I expected and to say I loved every single second of it would probably be the understatement of the century. There was never a dull or boring moment and after reading five books (6 if you count “The Assassin’s Blade”) I was actually surprised that I’m still able to fall for newly introduced characters. Thank you, Sarah! <3And of course special thanks also go to myprecious Gem! I wouldn’t have survived this book (and the slow burns) without you and I’m so glad we’re already reading the last book together! =) I can’t believe we actually buddy read this entire series!!! *lol* What’s going to come next?! We need another long series like that! XD'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Fuck rereading this book HURT MY HEARTOriginal review:I. Am. In. Tears.I was originally not at all excited for this book but then I reread the entire series and I was HYPED. This book didn't let me down at all. Not one bit. I'm shook to the max by how much I utterly love this book. I was in no way ready for everything that happened in this book and I'm blown away by all of the twists and turns that occurred.We all knew that Chaol's job was to get healed as well as raise an army. Honestly, the way Chaol's healing took place was so utterly raw and incredible. I think it was absolutely perfect where he ended up and I don't think Sarah could have done any better than this. This book is incredible perfection and I am in love.As someone who didn't like Chaol and slowly grew to like him in my reread, I would like to say that I love Chaol. That is all.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I was not prepared for this book.Tower of Dawnwas everything I wanted, even though I was not aware of it before the first chapters.A Court of Mist and Furyinflicted some serious damage to my relationship withSarah J. Maasdue to severe character mistreatment, shameless manipulation and a shrine built for Saint Rhysand, but this one restored my faith in her. Before readingTower of DawnI was furious for the delay in Throne of Glass' conclusion. Foranotherchange of ships I knew would come. I decided to dive into it for the sake of continuing the story, as if it was an unpleasant task I had to get over with. I never expected to bethisinvestedin the new characters. I never expected the frantic heartbeat, the way my chest exploded. And I ended up full of gratitude and a little awe in front of the miracle, the wondrous feeling of finding a little gem, a flare of magic where you least expected it.“He was Lord of Nothing. Lord of Oath-Breakers. Lord of Liars.”Tower of Dawnfollows Chaol and Nesryn's journey to the southern continent, in order to search for potential allies against the forces of Morath and a way to heal Chaol after the events ofQueen of Shadows. In a foreign land, a place thriving and actually cared for by its monarchs, Chaol was forced to face the demons within, along with the court manipulations and the political games between the viziers and the possible heirs of the khaganate. There he met Yrene Towers, an unwilling Healer hating Adarlan and everything Chaol represented with a seething passion, but for reasons unknown to him decided to help him nonetheless. Nesryn, on the other hand, was restless. Even though she finally found a place to blend in despite her mixed heritage, she craved the adventure Chaol promised her but never delivered. And so, she set off on an adventure of her own. On the back of aruk, she battled horrendous beings and came across secrets that could alter the outcome of the war to end all wars. In the city of Antica, where the Tower of Healers blessed by the Goddess loomed, in the unforgiving mountains of the famous ruk riders, Chaol and Nesryn found answers, even to questions they never dared ask.“For wherever you need to go - and then some. The world needs more healers. ”Healing.That's what Chaol needed, for his broken body and his broken soul, ravaged by the guilt and self-loathing that festered inside him. And Sarah, the wonderful and terrible Sarah, gave them to him. I always thought that his relationship with Aelin was not treated smoothly, that in her desperate need to make Rowan/Aelin happen, the author decided to sacrifice him. To be honest, though, I never turned against him. I just wanted Sarah to restore this beautiful, flawed character who gave up everything, his title, his honour, his men, and ended up feeling like a total waste, a disappointment and a pathetic excuse of a human being. The portayal of his inner thoughts, the broken pieces of him, wasspectacular, and so was thedepiction of disability, and how the emotional trauma, the constant feeling of incompetence, can wreck more havoc than the physical wound itself. Iachedfor him. For his trials, for his demons, for everything. His stay in the southern continent was a much-needed journey ofredemption, and in the end I feltpurified. Ready to conquer the world, fight the horrors of Morath and Erawan by his side. It wasinvigorating.“He had made one promise. He had not broken it yet.To save them.His friend, his kingdom.He still had that.Even here at the bottom of this dark hell, he still had that.”But Chaol was not the only one who needed to find himself. Yrene Towers, the young healer Aelin helped a lifetime ago, came to play a vital part. At first I was so angry at her, for being blind with rage and grief and failing to see that Chaol was not the one who took everything from her, that the same nation can breed both bad and good men. But as the story progressed, and her walls started crumbling, I loved the person that emerged.Her bravery, her devotion, her compassion.I keep saying that Sarah never fails to create imperfectly perfect male characters (except Rhysand, the One-Who-Makes-Mountains-Tremble), but her female characters are fantastic as well. They're badass, truly badass, and strong despite the impediments they keep facing. Nesryn is another example, and she proved again and again how brave and brilliant she is. The way her relationship with Chaol unfolded was, thankfully, well-handled, and she shone as an independent person, without Chaol's influence.“I wish we'd had time.”The characters introduced for the first time inTower of Dawnwere deeply intriguing, but there was one that made the others pale compared to him.Shartaq.Let's take a moment to admire the Winged Prince, who's a soft marshmallow and a fierce warrior at the same time.New crush alert, people, new crush alert (don't worry Dorian, you're still my number one bae)The feelings evoked while readingTower of Dawnwereall-encompassing, and I cried so many times I lost count. Tears of joy, sorrow, pain and relief stained my face, especially in the last chapters (and, to be honest, every time Chaol remembered or talked about Dorian, his brother, his king - his loyalty and love towards Dorian made my heart swell). The descriptions were vivid, and everything related to the khaganate, the history, the culture, the court intrigue, was fascinating, the new world was richly painted. I felt the freedom of riding on a ruk, and wandered in lush palaces full of spying servants and scheming nobles, grieving for a princess who was lost so young and rooting for the next heir of a prosperous kingdom. The revelations about the Valg, and the secrets contained in libraries and tombs set the road for an explosive final book. But as it's slowly sinking in how much I'll have to wait for the last instalment of the series I cherish, a series“I will cherish always.No matter what may befall the world.No matter the oceans, or mountains, or forests in the way.”I think I'm on the verge of depression.If you have any doubts about readingTower of Dawn, get over yourselves and read it. You won't regret it.For this review and more visit BookNest!""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""'Tower of Dawn' was one of my most anticipated books of the year. I absolutely could not wait to get my hands on it. I am a goner for this series!After the way things left off at the end of the fifth book, I was sure that this book would pick up where it had ended. I expected to dive right back into Celaena's current predicament and have a front row seat as she managed to battle her way out of captivity. That didn't happen.This book was not the book that I thought I'd be getting. That isn't to say that it was a let down though, it wasn't. It just wasn't at all what I was expecting.'Tower of Dawn' explores an entirely different aspect of this complex story. This book focuses on Chaol and his exploration of the Southern Continent. Not what I anticipated...but still fantastic.Let me be upfront about the fact that I was not the biggest fan of Chaol. In fact, over the past few books I had grown to detest him. He is a character that went from being a favorite of mine to one that I loathed. I wasn't sure that there would ever be any redemption for him.Incredibly, Sarah J. Maas has managed to work Chaol back into my good graces with this book. I wouldn't have believed it was possible, but she made it happen. This book showed a softer, more vulnerable side of Chaol. I even felt bad for him at times. Little by little, I found myself warming back up to him and understanding why he did some of the things that he did before.Horribly wounded, Chaol and Nesryn seek out the legendary healers of Torre Cesme in Antica. If anyone can cure Chaol of his paralysis, they will be found here. However, his mission is two-fold. He hopes to also gain additional support for the campaign in the North.Begrudgingly, Yrene is tasked with healing Chaol. It will be her greatest achievement, if she can overcome her deep-rooted hatred for Chaol and the kingdom that he represents. Yrene suffered greatly as a result of the King that Chaol fought for. She's faced with an ethical dilemma of epic proportions.The two eventually strike up an unlikely friendship. While the memory of what Chaol represents is never far from Yrene's mind, she finds herself seeing him as more man and less monster as time passes. Their relationship grows slowly and steadily, each trying to hold back their feelings until it eventually becomes impossible.As Chaol begins to heal, he starts questioning what he really wants. He feels remorse and shame for some of his past actions. With Yrene, he finds forgiveness and revived humanity.Of course, it wouldn't be a 'Throne of Glass' book if there wasn't plenty of danger and action. There was no shortage of adventure and heart-stopping situations. Expect a strong dose of the supernatural. Around every turn was the possibility of destruction as this battle between good and evil continues.My only disappointment was that I was dying to pick up where the last book left off. Unfortunately, I am still in the dark, along with a million other readers. Aside from a few very brief mentions at the very end of this book, Celaena, Rowan and Dorian are noticeably absent from this book. We'll all have to wait for the next one to get our questions answered.Even so, I found myself completely lost in this book. It was worth every minute. I listened to the Audible edition and it was fabulous. Honestly, if I weren't so bitter about the fact that I'm still left in the dark about Celaena's fate, I'd probably say this was a 5-star read. I spent a lot of time waiting for her to make an appearance before finally realizing that it wasn't going to happen and just enjoying the beauty of this book for what it was.Check out more of my reviews atwww.bookaddicthaven.com""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""3.25.21 update:It only took threealmost fouryears but I finally ready this book, who still has the fugliest cover in existence.

Not only is it so close to the end (just one book left!), but it takes place from Chaol’s perspective in the Southern Continent, and if you’ve read my reviews of the other books in this series, you know I’mnothis biggest fan.“You must enter where you fear to tread.”With that in mind, I’m not sure why I ever doubted Maas’ ability to entertain me, because no amount of dislike for Chaol could have kept me from still enjoying this book quite a bit. While Chaol is incredibly angsty and self-loathing through most of the book, and that aspect of his personality gets old quickly, he also grows so much as a character and comes to recognize his own flaws and mistakes in a way that makes it hard not to forgive him. He’s still not winning Character of the Year awards from me any time soon, but I definitely don’t hate him.“Using the chair is not a punishment. It is not a prison. It never was. And I am as much of a man in that chair, or with that cane, as I am standing on my feet.”There’s also a lot to be said for hisdisability rep.Chaol begins the book hating his wheelchair and himself, but he grows to accept his new disability and begins to realize that it’s going to hold him back from so much less than he thought it would. There are also a few discussions regarding how disabled individuals can feel like guinea pigs for physicians (healers), or how painful it is to be treated differently. I won’t promise this rep will work for every own-voice reader, but as someone who suffers from chronic pain and invisible disabilities, there were moments that actually made me cry because I felt so strongly understood by Chaol’s representation.It was like waking up or being born or falling out of the sky. It was an answer and a song, and she could not think or feel fast enough.The real shining stars in this book, though, are Nesryn and Yrene. They are both such enjoyable characters, and I especially loved watching the way Nesryn came to life when she finally got to come home. There’s a lot of talk about her feeling out of place at first, but she quickly comes to realize that she’s been welcomed into her homeland with open arms by almost everyone she meets, and it means so much to her that it’s incredibly heart-warming. They’re both strong-willed, independent women who could take on just about anything, whether it’s through Nesryn’s archery or Yrene’s healing, and I cherished them both tremendously.“I think she was a god… I never learned her name. She only left a note with two lines. ‘For wherever you need to go—and then some. The world needs more healers.’”We also meet quite a few new characters in this installment, as well as seeing some old faces (this would be a good time to tell you that it’s practically a requirement to read theAssassin’s Bladenovellas before picking upTower of Dawn!). I’ve mentioned this before, but I am a sucker for storylines that rally together all of the older, minor characters in the end, and Maas does that beautifully in bothEmpire of Stormsand in this book. I especially loved watching certain puzzle pieces fall into place for characters (as in the scene with Chaol and Yrene at the end of the book that literally made meweepover how much I love Aelin).Some swore the cats had been caught pawing through the pages of open books—reading.One thing I want to address, though, that made this a 4.5 instead of a solid 5 for me, is the fact that it was originally intended to be a novella, and then was almost 700 pages in the end. On the one hand, I do think this book is longer than it should be—but on the other hand, a novella length wouldn’t have fit everything in, either! I think something in the 450-500 page range would have been a much better length, but it’s not a big complaint from me, as I’d always rather a book be a little too long than way too short and rushed.This was not the end. This crack in him, this bottom, was not the end. He had one promise left.And finally, because a lot of people have asked me in the few days since I finished reading this:is this book required reading for the series?YES.There are reveals inTower of Dawnthat are freaking HUGE for the series as a whole, plus there is so much character development that I honestly think you can’t afford to miss it.

Chaol smiled back at his wife, at the light he'd unknowingly walked toward his entire life, even when he had not been able to see it.”It is,”he said quietly to Yrene.”It is.”i will be completely honest, i was really intimidated by the tandem read, but i’m so glad i went for it!! switching between the 2 books was a bit annoying initially, but i got used to it and ended up loving alternating between both storylines. it was such an emotional rollercoaster, and i actually had so much fun. i felt so accomplished by the end as well, and i would absolutely recommend everyone to tandem readempire of stormsand tower of dawn ~ i think taking a 4 month break from the series really helped me enjoy the tandem read, and i don’t think i would have enjoyed it as much if i had read the whole series all at once.i have to say, i enjoyed this book a bit more than empire of storms (maybe it’s because i have a soft spot for chaol… 🗣️ alexa, play “soft spot” by keshi 🤭)ᡣ𐭩.ᐟchaol and yreneto begin with, i have never hated chaol. yes, he was a pain in the ass inqueen of shadows, but nothing could ever make me hate him 😭💗chapter 55 almost brought me to tears. its message was so powerful and impactful. it revealed how his hatred, anger, fear, and pain were the parasites feeding on him, and that the demon haunting him was actually himself. this serves as a reminder that only we alone can truly face our own demons and decide whether we’re ready to fight back and defeat them 🥹“What if we go on, only to more pain and despair?”“Then it is not the end.”this has got to be one of my favourite quotes ever 🥲yrene is so strong, brave, quick-witted, and such a sweetheart. i love how she set aside her hatred for adarlan to fulfil her duty and never pitied or gave up on chaol during his healing journey.I LOVE THEM BOTH SO MUCH AAAAHH!!! they’re honestly my favourite couple in this series <3 the way chaol forced himself to stand up and walk just to get to yrene because he couldn’t bear to lose someone again got me screaming internally 😫😫😫 HE WOULD’VE LITERALLY CRAWLED 😭 and the way they protected each other and how chaol almost sacrificed his life for her makes me want to BAWL 😭 i genuinely thought he was going to die AGAIN, but i’m so glad the healers revived him. i’m not going to lie, i’m pretty sad he didn’t get to fully heal and that all their hard work kind of went down the drain at the end, but the fact that his life is now tied to hers feels kind of bittersweet? 🥲 i didn’t expect them to get married this quickly as well, but i’m so happy for them 🥹😭 i also teared up when he finally realized that aelin was the one who wrote the note to yrene 😭😭😭 fate brought him and yrene together 🥲“I will cherish it always. No matter what may befall the world. No matter the oceans, or mountains, or forests in the way.”“She had fallen in love with him well before he’d ever stood. She would love him no matter how he moved through the world.”“He did not regret. He did not look back. Not with Yrene in his arms, at his side. Not with the note she carried, that bit of proof… that bit of proof that he was exactly where he was meant to be. That he had always been headed there. Here.”ᡣ𐭩.ᐟsartaq and nesryni don’t have much to say about them tbvh. sartaq is such a gentleman, and i’m so glad nesryn finally found the love that she deserves. i also really enjoyed their “adventure” together in this book.“I heard the spies’ stories of you.

Many because Sarah J Maas pulled a back-hand and showed her readers she had a plan all along for Chaol and she didn’t just toss him aside like he was a wasted character.I loved exploring the Southern continent and how their lands work. We have a powerful royals who have spontaneous and wicked personalities who are fighting for the throne, we have a tower of women (with some men) who specialize in healing and not fighting which is so important, we have library cats because yes that is something we all didn’t know that we needed, we have giant spiders who are more deadly and animalistic than their northern sisters and absolutely something that I am terrified of yet want to know more about, and we have a huge twist that no one saw coming (and if you think you saw it coming, you’re wrong).I want to touch on the disability part in this book.I thought it was wonderfully done.I went to the release party that Sarah J Maas held in Nashville, Tennessee and she voiced that she spent months and months asking people how they do certain things with disabilities and watching videos on how things were done. She went that extra mile to not assume she would know how it would be done, but to ask people and to actually learn about that group of people.I believe her research paid off in this book. I will say that Chaol’s journey is a great one, and I am comparing this to the rest of the group’s journey’s here as well, but it isn’t all daisies and puppies at the end (which I completely prefer becauseanyone can be a hero, as long as they want it badly enough). She ended Chaol’s emotional journey in the absolute best way possible and I can’t say anymore because I will start crying for the fifth time.“you must enter where you fear to tread”She said one of the hardest things for her was to sit back and not say a word when people were bashing how she was treating Chaol. Letting people believe that his story didn’t matter to her, when she was yearning to write his story, not solely for the reason that his journey tilts the table of the war for Aelin and Company, but because she adores his character and has always had great plans for him.“Here, with her, he was home.”I have read some of my friend’s reviews who do deal with more crucial disabilities that I myself deal with, and I am happy to see that they feel represented, loved, appreciated, and like they too could kick the bad guy’s back-end.Also: I like that she doesn’t shy away from the fact that Chaol is a complete and total jerk when it comes to women in this book either.But do not fright my dears, he sees the errors of his ways one way or another and comes to his senses.There is also more representation for People of Color and the LGBT community as well!I have read some comments from people asking if you can read this book without reading the rest of the series. Let me be perfect clear:absolutely not. This is how I believe you should read it.01.\tThrone of Glass02.\tCrown of Midnight03.\tHeir of Fire04.\tQueen of Shadows05.\tThe Assassin’s Blade (all five novellas)06.\tEmpire of Storms07.\tTower of DawnAgain, Sarah voiced that her novellas are crucial to the story line (and that has been proven to be correct). She doesn’t write them to get more money or to advertise for her books or anything greedy like that; some stories are shorter than others,but they are still important.For example, you have to readThe Assassin and the Pirate Lordbefore you readEmpire of Storms, and you have to readThe Assassin and the Healerbefore you readTower of Dawn. You miss crucial parts of the story when you don’t read a Maas novella.The Healer is named Yrenne and she is one of three (err, four if you count the last two-so pages.. #heartbroken) point of views in this book, Nesryn and Chaol being the other two. I loved there only being three points of views for a change.Maas has a reputation now for putting a lot of steam in her book, and I want to tell you that this one is very tame. There is one scene. That’s it. So if you didn’t like all the scenes in Empire of Storms or in her other series A Court of Thrones and Roses, this book may be right up your alley.I don’t want to give too much away in this book, but a lot of it is about healing and forgiving yourself. We went on a journey with Aelin and now we get to see a journey not only with Chaol but also with Yrene. These characters have all been through horrible stuff, but they overcome it and are stronger because of it.I have been going through a lot of hardships lately and reading this book has shown me that I will be alive tomorrow, I will be able to not get over it but get passed it, and I will and can be happy if I only let myself.PS: Sorry for the novel.. but not really sorry.--I'm really liking this so far because there's only a few POVs and not twenty.--Sarah is as awkward and adorable as I wanted her to be. She loves her characters as much as we do and cries as much as we do and most importantly she is obsessed with dogs... or animals in general.---I get to meet Maas today and I am so pumped for it!---Question: is it acceptable to call in to work to read a book? Or do I just tell them I have Ebola?Asking for a friend.---WHAT A BEAUTIFUL TITLE! I'm so excited!""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '”I will cherish it always. No matter what may befall the world. No matter the oceans, or mountains, or forests in the way”.Incluso con el libro al que menos fe le tenía, Sarah J. Maas lo hizo de nuevo. Después de todos los ires y venires que ha tenido la historia deThrone of Glasscon respecto a Chaol, pensé queTower of Dawnse me iba a hacer insufrible. ¿Cómo me iba a aguantar un libro que se aleja de todos los personajes principales, de la guerra, y que me iba a dejar un montón de tiempo sin Aelin y Rowan? Pues, chicos, lo leí, lo amé y me trago todas mis palabras.Después de los desastrosos sucesos que rodearon la destrucción del palacio de cristal, Chaol queda paralizado de la cintura hacia abajo y ni siquiera Rowan puede ayudarlo con su magia. Así, Chaol y Nesryn deben embarcarse hacia Antica, el hogar de la mítica Torre Cesme, donde se rumora viven las curanderas más poderosas del mundo. Chaol no sólo tendrá que concentrarse en recuperar su movilidad, sino que tendrá que intentar crear una improbable alianza con elkhaganate, el imperio más poderoso del continente, pues de eso dependerá que puedan inclinar la balanza en la inminente guerra contra Morath.Antes de empezar con losspoilerspuedo decirles que este libro me hizo adorar nuevamente a Chaol. Me encantó ver todo su cambio a lo largo de las páginas y, más que eso, me gustó muchísimo su faceta vulnerable. ¿Y qué decirles de Yrene? Esa chica que conocemos en los relatos deThe Assassin’s Blade, y que en su momento no me cayó bien, terminó siendo un personaje muy querido para mí. Y lo último que puedo decirles es que Sarah J. Maas hizo un trabajo increíble con la ambientación y la construcción del mundo en este libro. Adoré la vibra oriental y de arabia que me daba todo en Antica, elkhaganatey las tierras de más allá.Ahora…SPOILERS!!!♣♣♣1. Ese primer momento en el que Hafiza le dice a Yrene que su siguiente caso será curar a un poderoso Lord de Adarlan y ella queda en shock porque fueron soldados de Adarlan quienes quemaron viva a su mamá es muy fuerte. ¡De verdad pensé que se iba a negar en redondo y a dejar a mi pobrecillo Chaol a su suerte!2. AY, MADRE, ¿qué tal cuando por fin Yrene va a examinar a Chaol y le pregunta que si su “parte favorita masculina” le funciona? CASI ME MUERO DE LA RISA Y PENA AJENA.3. Okay, desde ese momento en el que alguien sigue a Yrene por la biblioteca y termina asesinando a otra curandera todo se vuelve muy oscuro. Está clarísimo que los Valg también están en Antica. ¡Y es hermoso ver cómo Chaol se preocupa por ella!4. Amé MAL el momento en el que Chaol, gracias al mecanismo que crearon, puede subirse a un caballo y sentirse medianamente libre de nuevo. En serio, es que leer lo impotente que se siente al principio desde su silla me partía el corazón.5. Los tratamientos de Yrene y Chaol para curarlo… JO-DER. Es una tortura tremenda, porque no solo es dolor físico el que está sintiendo en su columna, sino que la oscuridad dentro de él lo lleva a recordar momentos muy dolorosos. Pobrecillo mío.6. LOS OJITOS QUE SE HACEN DESDE EL PRINCIPIO NESRYN Y SARTAQ.7. Literal casi lloro cuando después de una de las sesiones Chaol recupera la movilidad de los dedos.8. Un día, en una fiesta loca de las que organizan los príncipes, Chaol invita a Yrene a unos cojines para salvarla de las atenciones de Kashin. Y hay humo de opio por todas partes y eso los empieza a afectar un poco. Y TERMINAN HABLANDO MUY PEGADITOS Y ME MUERO. ¡Lo peor es que en este punto Chaol ya sabe que no quiere estar con Nesryn, pero no ha acabado las cosas con ella y por eso su sentido del honor le impide hacer nada con Yrene! Agh.9. ¡AHHH! Y esa noche Chaol se queda hablando con Nesryn… y a la mañana siguiente llega Yrene y los ve en la cama. Y CASI LE DA ALGO. Pero en realidad no pasó nada entre ellos y Chaol sale detrás de ella para explicárselo. En este punto ya losshippeo like crazyy faltan muchas páginas para que pase algo.10. En serio, me sentía tan feliz cada que Chaol y Yrene lograban derrotar un poquito de la oscuridad de la lesión. ¡Y luego llega el punto en el que puede mover los pies! Todo después de una sesión en la que tiene que recordar todos los abusos que sufrió gracias a su padre. Cabrón ese.11. ¡Ahhhh! Momento emocionante en el que por fin Nesryn se va con Sartaq en Kadara, su ruk, para visitar a su pueblo. ¡ESO SIGNIFICAN TRES SEMANAS PARA CHAOL Y YRENE! ¡SOLITOS!BOOM!12. Justo después de que Nesryn se va Chaol queda con un humor de perros porque cree que Nesryn se fue por su culpa, entonces está de mal genio y Yrene lo nota. Cuando está volviendo a donde Chaol por la tarde, siente que algo la está siguiendo y termina corriendo con todas sus fuerzas para llegar a la habitación. Allí arman una barricada y me dolió muchísimo leer cómo Chaol pensaba defenderla incluso estando en su silla, incluso sacrificándose. Pero al final el atacante escapa sin entrar a la habitación y cuando llegan los guardias y Kashin, Yrene dice que prefiere quedarse con Chaol porque allí se siente segura.AWWWWW!!!13. Ese momento épico en el que losrukhinquieren ver la verdadera capacidad de Nesryn como arquera y ella hace un triple blanco en tres objetivos y todos quedan flipando.YAS, GIRL!14. Adoré la escena en la que Chaol y Yrene salen a la ciudad a cenar, así en plan romántico. Ay, me derrito.15. Me encantó ver cómo Chaol nunca se rindió, siguió entrenando solo, con los otros soldados, o incluso enseñándoles defensa personal a las chicas de la Torre con Yrene. ¡Y aquí me encanta la conexión que hay con la historia deThe Assassin’s Blade! Porque cuando Celaena salvó a Yrene, le enseñó unos trucos de defensa personal y le hizo prometer que se los enseñaría a cuantas mujeres lo necesitaran. ¡Y eso es lo que ha hecho ella con las chicas de la Torre!16. Otro día, después de una infructuosa negociación con elkhagan, Chaol se porta como un idiota con Yrene durante su sesión, así que ella se para y va hacia la puerta. Pero en ese instante Chaol se da cuenta de que si no la detiene, si no va por ella, ahí va a acabar lo que no ha empezado entre ellos. Así que LOGRA DAR UN PASO… Y OTRO… Y OTRO… HASTA QUE TIENE A YRENE ACORRALADA CONTRA LA PARED… ¡Y POR FIN SE BESAN! ¡AHHHHHHH! Yo casi lloro de la emoción.17. Y al día siguiente están paseando y esta vez es Yrene la que se lo lleva a un lugar para poder besarlo yjafkadlfadlalkdsj, SO HOT.18. JODER. Esa escena en la que Sartaq y Nesryn caen en una de las trampas de las arañas y caen en picado desde el cielo… Y SARTAQ GIRA PARA PROTEGER A NESRYN Y QUE NO LE PASE NADA. Ay, en serio, ¿dónde se consiguen hombres como los que hay en los libros?19. Como parte de un plan para investigar sobre los Valg, Yrene convence a la princesa Hasar de que la lleve al Oasis Aksara (privado para la realeza) a celebrar su cumpleaños. Allí, después de la fiesta, Chaol y ella se van a hablar. Yrene le pregunta si todavía ama a Aelin o a Nesryn y él le dice que no. Y luego saca un relicario con sus iniciales, montañas y océanos grabados. Le dice que es para que guarde esa nota que siempre tiene en su bolsillo y para que recuerde que ella sola pudo cruzar océanos y montañas para llegar hasta donde está. Y LUEGO SE EMPIEZAN A BESAR Y TODO ES MUY LINDO Y LUEGO LO HACEN A PESAR DE LA POBRE ESPALDA DE CHAOL, PERO, JODER, TODO ES PERFECTO.20. Volviendo a Nesryn y Sartaq… hay un derrumbe y el pobre queda atrapado. Y allí le dice que la amó incluso antes de conocerla, tan solo escuchando las historias sobre ella. Y es todo tan triste. Y se dicen que ojalá hubieran tenido más tiempo.21. MOMENTOWTFCUANDO LAS ARAÑAS ESAS REVELAN QUE MAEVE NO ES UNA REINAFAESINO UNA REINA VALG. A-Y-U-D-A.22. Llega un momento en el que Yrene decide que va a acabar con la oscuridad en Chaol, que ese es el día en el que lo va a curar, así que tienen la sesión de curación más intensa y dolorosa de la vida. ¡Pero al final lo logra y Chaol recupera toda su movilidad! Luego él se va a bañar e Yrene lo sigue y vuelven a estar juntos y muero de amor. Sobre todo porque luego se dicen que se aman y LLORO, ¿VALE?23. Y aquí es cuando todo se va yendo al traste. Chaol y Yrene van a buscar a Hafiza, pero no la encuentran por ninguna parte, así que siguen su rastro hasta lo más profundo de la biblioteca, donde se encuentran a Duva, la hija menor delkhagan, amenazando a la curandera mayor. Duva está poseída por un Valg y revela que fue ella quien mató a su hermana menor cuando empezó a sospechar de ella.Shit.Y luego empieza la pelea, Hafiza se suelta pero queda malherida e Yrene intenta curarla, todo mientras Chaol pelea con Duva, que lanza ráfagas de oscuridad. Cuando uno de esos rayos está a punto de darle a Yrene, Chaol se interpone Y EL RAYO ESE LE DA DE NUEVO EN LA ESPALDA Y PIERDE LA SENSACIÓN, JODER, JODER, JODER. Justo cuando Yrene está a punto de matar a Duva, llegan Sartaq y Nesryn con guardias y un montón de curanderas. Hafiza logra que Duva quede inconsciente…24. PERO CHAOL ESTÁ AL BORDE DE LA MUERTE. Yrene intenta curarlo, pero no tiene suficiente fuerza, así que todas las curanderas le prestan su poder, pero están jugando en terreno peligroso. Prácticamente lo está trayendo de vuelta a la vida y eso requiere pagar un precio que Yrene acepta gustosa. Cuando POR FIN Chaol reacciona, ve que puede moverse y está vivo, pero entiende que hubo un precio. Hafiza le cuenta que Yrene tuvo que unir sus vidas, lo que implica que cuando uno muera el otro también lo hará. Pero eso no es todo, su lesión era tan complicada que no pudo curarse por completo, así que solo podrá caminar bien cuando Yrene esté con sus fuerzas al máximo y su magia actúe como un soporte para él, pero cuando ella esté débil él tendrá que usar el bastón… o la silla. Y TODO ES MUY INJUSTO, JODER. Pero Chaol lo acepta felizmente.25. Al final llevan a Duva-Valg, aún inconsciente, ante elkhagany él le pide a Yrene que lo haga. Con dificultad ella lo logra y el hombre, tremendamente, agradecido, le dice que le pida lo que quiera y él se lo dará. ¡Así es como logran obtener el apoyo delkhaganatepara la guerra! Y no sólo sus fuerzas marcharán, sino también los guerrerosrukhinde Sartaq, tropas de Kashin y la mismísima Hasar.26. Awwww, y el momento en el que Sartaq busca a Nesryn, que está con su familia y Kadara, y le cuenta que ahora es el Heredero y que le dijo a su padre que iría a la guerra porque hacia allí va la mujer a la que ama. Y SE BESAN Y LOS AMO Y LOSSHIPPEOMUCHO TAMBIÉN!27. ¿Y podemos hablar de que Chaol y Yrene SE CASARON? MI CORAZÓNFANGIRLNO PUEDE CON TANTOOOO. Y cuando van en el barco ya de regreso Yrene le muestra la nota que guarda siempre… ¡Y CHAOL RECONOCE LA LETRA DE AELIN! ¡ES QUE SARAH J. MAAS ES UNA GENIA! Y Chaol le dice que no se deshaga de la nota, que más adelante va a conocer a alguien a la que seguro le gustará verla.28.

Wow. Wow. I\'m actually speechless! This book was everything I needed and more and I have no clue how to write this review because I have so much to say and my thoughts are actually still all over the place.I have so much love for this book my heart\'s going to burst.If you know me, you know I love Chaol Westfall to bits and pieces and he\'s one of my all-time favorite male characters. And here\'s where I get all emotional about him. I\'ve loved him ever since ToG and still loved him through everything he went through. I would defend him to my last breath and I would fight anyone who insults him. Chaol is a pure soul. He\'s loyal. He\'s honorable. He\'s strong. He\'s brave. He\'s human. He\'s flawed.He\'s real.All of the things he went through from ToG to QoS changed him as a person and the way he dealt with things was completely realistic. Yes, he made his own mistakes, but again, that makes him real. Don\'t you always complain about needing realistic, flawed characters? Chaol Westfall is one. Chaol Westfall deserves all that\'s good and beautiful in this world. Thank you.With the events of ToG till QoS, it all broke Chaol. Tower of Dawn did not only serve as a book where Chaol seeks healing and hopes to get more allies, but also it was his emotional journey. He was so broken at the beginning of the book. Filled with despair and self loathing. He learns to forgive himself. By the end of the book, he\'s come to terms with a lot of things and he rebuilds himself all over again. He has hope by the end of the book. He\'s no longer drowning in guilt and self loathing. And I was honestly in tears throughout the majority of the book because Chaol\'s emotional journey hit me. It was so intense and real and raw and I applaud SJM for doing it so realistically and so beautifully! I\'ve said it a million times before and here I am saying it again, nobody does broken characters and healing like SJM does! The healing process was more of less similar to Celaena\'s in HoF and Feyre\'s in ACOMAF and personally, I think it was even more emotional. I\'ve been waiting for Chaol to find happiness and peace since CoM and he finally did in this book and oh lord, I want to cry tears of joy all over again.In this book, we see Yrene Towers again. For those who don\'t know her previously, she\'s a character that appeared in one of the novellas of The Assassin\'s Blade. Yrene is a main character in this book and while I was very neutral about her at first, I slowly loved her as the book progressed. Nesryn Faliq is also a main character in this book and she had her own plot which revealed loads of things! I was quite worried about Nesryn\'s character because she was introduced as a minor character within Chaol\'s plot. But in this book, no. Nesryn is her own character. We get to know so much about her and she has her own plot separate from Chaol\'s. We meet so many new side characters who are important too. My favorite side character is definitely Sartaq, one of the Khagan\'s children!For those who think this book is ""not important"", well it is. It is super important. Loads of things happen. Loads of event the reader needs to know about happen. Information essential to the overall plot of the series was introduced in this book. So, yes. You need to read this book after EoS. So much history is revealed; history that is essential. History you need to know. So, no. This book is not a side story or a novella you can skip. It\'s a book youshouldread in order to understand whatever is coming next in ToG7.Now... the ships. Oh dear God, the ships!! I\'m not going to go into details because spoilers. But what I\'ll tell you is those ships will end you! It took me some time to accept some ships, but once I did, oooooh boy, the angst! I was swooning, I was screaming, I was also crying. Oh dear. Again, SJM\'s ships are always so beautiful!!!Now, the disability rep. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. The care and hard work SJM put into this was so evident. Chaol learns to deal and accept his disability. Going from one state to another is never easy and it takes a toll on a person. Coming to terms with things is a long process. It\'s not a day and night thing. And that\'s exactly what Chaol goes through. I\'m stressing again on Chaol\'s emotional journey and how real it was because it is so incredibly important and seeing Chaol heal and forgiving himself and coming to terms with so many things just really makes me super emotional all over again. I\'m super attached to him so you can understand.Tower of Dawn takes place in Antica, which is a new setting in the ToG universe. And for that reason, SJM had to spend some page time on world-building, which I personally loved. Her creativity and her sources of inspiration were evident and despite that this world-building made the book a tad slow, it was still essential and wonderful.I feel like I\'ve missed out on a lot of things I wanted to say. But that\'s all for now I guess. A lot of my thoughts are spoiler-y and I didn\'t want to add those in the review for now. This review will never do the book or the characters justice. This book is perfect and beautiful and real and painful and emotional and yes, adefinite favorite of 2017 and also my favorite ToG book.Update 20/June/2017:WE HAVE A COVER... and I\'m not a fan.It doesn\'t match the rest of the books and I just wanted the cover to have my precious baby Chaol on it. *sighs*19/June/2017:GUYS GUYS GUYS.GUYS!!GUYS!!!!THE COVER REVEAL IS TOMORROW.I REPEAT, THE COVER REVEAL IS TOMORROW.I can\'t wait to have this book in my hands! My precious baby Chaol. I\'m not saying I would die for Chaol Westfall but that\'s exactly what I\'m saying.'}]"

Ruthless Vows (Letters of Enchantment, #2)
",Rebecca   Ross,4.02,292761,221320,"Fantasy, Romance, Young Adult, Romantasy, Audiobook, Fiction, Historical Fiction",420,26-12-2023,"The epic conclusion to the intensely romantic and beautifully written story that started in Divine Rivals.Two weeks have passed since Iris Winnow returned home bruised and heartbroken from the front, but the war is far from over. Roman is missing, and the city of Oath continues to dwell in a state of disbelief and ignorance. When Iris and Attie are given another chance to report on Dacre’s movements, they both take the opportunity and head westward once more despite the danger, knowing it’s only a matter of time before the conflict reaches a city that’s unprepared and fracturing beneath the chancellor’s reign.Since waking below in Dacre’s realm, Roman cannot remember his past. But given the reassurance that his memories will return in time, Roman begins to write articles for Dacre, uncertain of his place in the greater scheme of the war. When a strange letter arrives by wardrobe door, Roman is first suspicious, then intrigued. As he strikes up a correspondence with his mysterious pen pal, Roman will soon have to make a decision: to stand with Dacre or betray the god who healed him. And as the days grow darker, inevitably drawing Roman and Iris closer together…the two of them will risk their very hearts and futures to change the tides of the war.","[{'rating': 2, 'content': '➸2.5 stars”write me a story where there is no ending, kitt. write to me and fill my empty spaces.”in this sequel, Ruthless Vows seamlessly picks up where it’s predecessor left off. this story thrusts readers back into the enchanting world of Oath, where unruly magic, war and sleeping gods collide. two weeks have passed since iris winnow reluctantly returned home from the war front with her brother forest. she now grapples with the deceptive calm that envelops her hometown and iris battles with not knowing if roman has survived the bombing.i was going to rate this 3 stars but something happened at the end that made it lose .5 of a star. that really hurt my feelings, why would you do that 😭😭damn, these new anticipated releases have not been it at ALL. idk if authors are trying way too hard to live up to their success or we just have high expectations but these releases have not been hitting whatsoever. you all don’t understand how sad it makes me to even rate it this but i just did not enjoy this book whatsoever. nothing felt captivating, it was underwhelming, there was no plot and this book just couldn’t keep my attention.whilst i was desperate for the continuation of roman and iris’ story i cant help but feel so dissatisfied with this conclusion. i was completely blown away by how romantic, emotional and intimate DR was. i was craving that same feeling again when i picked up ruthless vows. i really just wanted this book to explore more on iris and roman’s love story and their marriage. although their story continues, it feels like they are not the main characters anymore. their chapters fell flat for me, and their conversations were odd and out of place since they were apart for majority of the book, which for the life of me i cannot comprehend why that were apart for 95% of the book. there were so many times were i would pick up my kindle, read one to two chapters, put my kindle back down then pick it back up 1-2 days later.. like that’s how bored i was with this story, it was actually a mission for me to finish this. i was contemplating dnfing so many times but i hate to dnf books. i was waiting for this to get better and it didn’t lmao. i hate when authors throw in the amnesia trope bc the whole connection and the build-up between the characters is erased and then they have to find their way back to each other again. ahhh i just wanted more cheesy, cutesy, lovey-dovey romaniris moments!!""the problem is... i want to hear from you at all hours. i want to read your words. i am greedy for them. i am hungry for them.""the first half was honestly just a recap of divine rivals, but with different circumstances. i hate how romaniris were apart, it was for way too long for my liking!! i was missing the connection to the characters, the stolen glances, the little touches, the tension and pining. i wish there were more beautiful letters, that’s what made divine rivals so enchanting. i absolutely adored all of the tender moments between roman and iris in the first book, but there was barely any romance in this book which is so disappointing (apart from chapter 35, that chapter was so tender and will be next fixation aaa my heart!!!) the first book built it up perfectly to continue it on for this story. like i hated how they got married so quickly so i really thought it was going to be explored and how they will adapt to marriage after they are reunited but there was absolutely no depth to their characters. it seems that the author doesn’t know how balance and differentiate between the romance and fantasy plot. since divine rivals was lacking fantasy, ruthless vows was lacking romance.i know we asked for more world-building and more on the gods but please we didn’t mean take the focus off of romaniris 😩 the war between the gods felt so sloppy to me, so really you did this for what?? nothing 😭 dacre has no personality beyond being entitled, controlling, mind-numblingly stupid and an actual joke. are you seriously expecting me to take him as a villain when he didn’t even feel threatening.. idk why but i just kept picturing him as dr. evil from austin powers. for a god with big plans why was he so trusting towards roman?? it didn’t make sense to me, he literally told roman all of his plans.. like sir, are you dumb or stupid?? he was practically the main character in this book and it took all of the focus off of romaniris. also enva felt like a background character and a puppet master. idk what the point of her character was bc she just pops up out of no where at the end to save the day.i also think the author was trying to do too much and therefore none of it was executed perfectly. introducing the ‘graveyard’ felt unnecessary bc they had no important relevance to this story whatsoever.the tone of changes between chapters was so ??? in one chapter you have a god causing massive destruction and you will feel the urgency and think “omg what is dacre going to do now?” but then in the next chapter you will have the characters at a cafe drinking tea and eating scones or attending family dinners like there isn’t a war occuring. why give me a rush and make me feel super anxious only for it to be ruined..this story fell flat for me, i just didn’t feel that spark like i did with divine rivals. i will always applaud rebecca ross for her beautiful writing and her lyrical prose. although this book wasn’t enjoyable for me, romaniris will always have a special place in my heart. i’m keeping them in my pocket forever 🥹let our breaths twine and our blood become one, until our bones return to dust.#1Divine Rivals—4.25 stars#2 Ruthless Vows —2.5 stars'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '➳1/5 stars“Write me a story where there is no ending, Kitt. Write to me and fill my empty spaces.”This highly anticipated read of last year left me utterly disappointed, and the excitement turned into a month-long struggle to finish. It\'s baffling how all my anticipated reads from that year ended up being letdowns. I literally forced myself through it, and the disappointment was real 😭This book left me utterly disappointed. I know we asked for more depth in the backstory of gods and some world-building, but it lacked the cute, angsty moments between Roman and Iris that I was eagerly waiting for. It breaks my heart to give it this rating, but no matter how hard I tried, it simply didn\'t live up to my expectations. Considering""Divine Rivals""was one of my best reads last year, this one turned out to be a complete opposite – a significant letdown that left me genuinely disheartened.Honestly, in this book, Roman and Iris didn\'t even felt like the main characters at all. Their chapters were strangely bland and boring, making it hard to believe these were the same characters I once loved. The conversations felt out of place and nonchalant, leaving me wondering why they spent most of the book apart. The amnesia trope, which could have been intriguing, fell flat in Rebeca\'s execution. It left me yearning for a much better portrayal than what unfolded in this narrative.Divine Rivals\' enchantment for me lay in thelove letters, and I eagerly anticipated those cute exchanges, but alas, it turned out to be another source of disappointment. By the end, I was convinced there wouldn\'t be any mind-blowing twist to rekindle my interest, and unfortunately, that proved true. The ending felt bland and predictable. While I appreciated the world-building, it felt disheartening to see Roman and Iris being the side characters in their own book. The only main character wasDacrewhich seemed to embody only entitlement with a lack of any other personality trait. It\'s hard to take him seriously, especially considering his lackluster use of godly powers and unwarranted trust in Roman.Enva\'sconstant appearances felt more like background noise than meaningful contributions, especially given her seemingly vast powers that went underutilized. As for""the graveyard,""its relevance remained elusive throughout, leaving me wondering if the author threw it in as a page-filling afterthought. Overall, it was disappointing to see potentially intriguing elements fall flat in execution.The war scenes felt strangely disconnected. On one hand, there were vivid depictions of mass destruction, yet on the other, people were casually attending balls and celebrations as if unaffected by the chaos. This portrayal seemed irrational, lacking the depth of struggles and pain one expects in wartime narratives. The juxtaposition of these elements left the depiction of war feeling awkward and poorly executed.The story fell flat for me. The first half was just a tedious recap, and the second half felt like an irrelevant mix of celebrations and scattered destruction. The absence of the cute, lovey-dovey moments between Romaniris left a void, while Dacre\'s lack of personality made him uninteresting. Enva, for me, was nothing more than a forgettable background character. Although I admire Rebecca\'s enchanting writing, this book failed to capture my enjoyment.°˖➴Overall, if you cherished divine rivals and are contemplating picking this up, I\'d say save yourself the trouble. It\'s a disappointing follow-up that falls short of expectations. You won\'t miss out on anything worthwhile.

Tuck my words into your pocket. Let them be your armor.""Wow. What a fantastic way to end the duology and such a beautifully crafted story. I was moved; the book I read was not mere words, they were emotions, heartfelt moments, something I envisioned and felt so real. It was not just reading, it was breathing and living this book- this duology.With 2023 coming to an end, it\'s books like these that make me realize why I love reading. Both, Divine Rivals and Ruthless Vows are written to perfection. The story, the characters, the fantasy elements, the letters, and the writing are immensely captivating. 🤌I am aware of the mixed reviews for this book and am sad to see it did not work for everyone the way it worked for me. But that\'s the beauty- reading is subjective.Also, I noticed the thing that might have worked for me was the fact I did not immediately jump from Divine Rivals to this.The reason being, am aware that the pacing is on the slower side and I had to put some gap in between those two reads. 🤷\u200d♀️Coming back to this book, I found the start to be super intriguing- I didn\'t expect a different pov prologue.People who found Divine Rivals not focusing more on the fantasy elements will like this book better, as the gods- Dacre and Enva are far more involved and the fantasy elements are there throughout. It\'s a YA book so don\'t expect any hardcore scenes or history between the gods.🗡Iris-Honestly, I love her. I admire her, especially after that ending. She is such a strong woman and so loyal to those she loves. She faced so many difficulties and yet she did not waver, she was vulnerable yes, but she molded her emotions and love into her strength. Her love for Roman, her patience levels with him was one worth giving an applause.🖋Roman-MY LOVE. I love him so much, I swear words will fail to describe. He is literally perfect. The man can do no wrong, even when he has no recollection of events, places, time, or people. The way he is so loyal to humanity, to his love, to his heart and his wife was everything to read. I loved his scenes and struggles so much. The way he dealt with Dacre was so intense yet so powerful. He wasn\'t shy to admit things, to cower behind, to claim his as his own and I loved that. I can write a whole damn essay on him but saving y\'all some time.☯️Dacre and Enva-Such complex characters. Although Enva tried to represent ""good"" and balanced things, she represented herself as a savior. Even with her big reveal, it didn\'t impact me much as I found it to be a bit predictable. Yet, I found Dacre and his villainous personality to be more powerful. He outshines Enva in his evil ways. There certainly was more of him than her and I won\'t complain cause he did bring out so much good in Roman.❤Supporting characters- Attie, Tobias, Forest and Sarahwere so good. Their dynamic was amazing to read. The chemistry between them was so endearing, the banter so fun, like I was giggling and blushing. I know we were all angry with Forest, but he truly impressed me in this one. I liked Sarah since the beginning of Divine Rivals..""Did you think I would let him tell me when and how to touch you? Did you think I would let him steal this last moment from me? When I surrender only to you, take you in my hands and burn with you before the end comes?""The romance-Y\'all are not prepared. It\'s so angsty. The mutual pining. The letters. The dangers of being in enemy territory and yet yearning for the other. The slow burn. The loyalty. The flirting. The claiming. The protectiveness. The throwing themselves in danger to protect the other. The facing a god but never betraying the one you love. EVERYTHING about the romance was done brilliantly. Iris and Roman have my entire heart and deserve each and every bit of happiness and love. I love the love they have for each other. ❤️\u200d🔥❤️\u200d🔥My heart is in pieces with thatending.I didn\'t expect that. I loved the last 100 pages- they were intense, action packed, romantic and full of pain, hugs and things I can\'t really find words to explain. I wish some character arcs had worked out different cause my heart will not recover anytime soon.I hope someday she decides to write a spin off for Attie.

They were such a joke. I personally didn’t care about them in divine rivals and was merely interested to know about them. So for those that wanted more world building in regards to the fantasythis one is for youas it had plenty that it overshadowed the romance imo. But it overall felt so mundane and the world building fell flat for me. I know this is YA but there’s more telling than showing. Now, I didn’t mind the prospect of war but the whole purpose of it wassenselessso therefore it took my enjoyment away as the romance had the opportunity to be explored more but instead we were met with a pointless war and weakly structured gods and the resolution with them was also weak. you mean to tell me someone able and knowing of something to defeat a certain person but not doing so over a ridiculous reason and upheld that reason at the expense of others?? I guess the title of the book makes sense now but they just sat their ass down on the ability to do so while so much chaos ensued.2.The pacing. It was less of a condensed experience as It took me quite some time to be able to get fully immersed in the book compared to DR. I found myself picking up my kindle and putting it down at different points in the book telling myself I’m savoring this and possibly feeling slumpy but then I saw others expressing the same so i wasn’t alone in feeling that way. End of part 3 to part 4 is where things picked up and felt the most climatic yet anticlimactic but I admit I was so on edge as a result of everything happening given the emotions were running high that I felt some adrenaline coursing through me in anticipation3.the romance. Because of the obvious obstacle, I understand it’s part of the reason we didn’t get so much but did that reason have to drag to 40%? It felt like we only got 15-20% romance in this and I was literally living off the crumbs 😔 Some of their letters were cute and reminiscent of those in DR but somehow vague here which is partially understandable considering nothing could be expressed freely? Idk. After book 1’s events, they didn’t have time to explore their relationship more and see each other and one chapter was made indicative of that so I wish we could’ve gotten more of them doing so and seeing the progression of it.4.The many plot holes that I won’t spoil but I was left with some unanswered questions. And forest? I was surprised to change my mind about him and feel like Marisol and Keegan should’ve switched places..Onto what I did enjoy:“Their souls weren’t mirrors but complements, constellations that burned side by side”The full circle role reversal moment in one of Iris and Roman’s letters (I screamed here), their reunion and their face to face interactions even though it was limited,✨ chapter 35✨🥹 some of chapter 36, chapter 44 towards the end and the ending (although a bit rushed) had my heart and attention. It reminds me of chapter 41 in a curse for true love (Iykyk). The problem evidently was thelack of moreand excess of other things here for me.Also, themulti pov chapteras it showed the war happening in real time for certain people and you could truly feel the beauty/angst of it. which brings me to addressing that I did manage to feel some of the emotions throughout the book at certain points especially given the anguish and pain Iris felt but mostly in the last part of this as I teared up lolRoman and Iris became one of my favorites last year given Rebecca’s ability to write their characters so intricately, exquisitely, and relatable—other than their words feeling likemagic on paperand it felt like that here yet it didn’t despite them having gone through so much. I could go on but I’m happy they got their happy ending 🥺 they will both be incredibly missed*holding out hope Rebecca considers a novella as I want more of them and possibly attie*In all, I know reading is subjective and I really wish I fully loved this as so many of you did. It pains me giving this lower than 5 stars (it took me days to process this) knowing Roman and Iris deserve ♾️♾️ stars and this is their conclusion but so many things were underwhelming and many plot points some of us would’ve wanted more than what we were met with that it fell flat despite enjoying some of it. To me, divine rivals could’ve been wrapped up with a longer page length and a different conclusion.But, in all honesty, this wasn’t a bad book—it just wasn’t what I expected.Divine rivals reviewSome quotes:”How I love to lose to you.

Unfortunately, I didn\'t loveRuthless Vowsas much asDivine Rivals, however, I still think it was a great conclusion to such a beautiful story.What I loved:Roman and Iris.😭💕 These two may have the most beautiful connection and love story I’ve ever read about. Amazing characters that are both so likable, but together they are as brilliant as the sun. I love them both with my whole heart.The action.This story is a lot more centered on the war, and Iris and Roman go through A LOT of harrowing / dangerous things to protect the people they love and save the world.The found family / familial love.The way Roman, Iris, and their friends rely on one another is beautiful. Love drives them and without it, they would have all been lost.The ending (the last 25%) has me in a chokehold.Just . . . WOW. So much happens and I could not put the book down! It’s high stakes and there’s a lot of things at play, so I was constantly at the edge of my seat waiting to find out what happens next.Rebecca Ross’ writing.This woman is a MASTER of words. Every sentence is wonderfully crafted with lyrical and enchanting prose. Reading this feels like a beautiful dream where you can’t help but fall in love with this story and the characters because Rebecca’s words captivate you from the first sentence.What I didn\'t love:This was a lot more war-plot focused, which I totally get, but it just didn’t intrigue me as much.In Divine Rivals, I really fell in love with the beautiful romance between Iris and Roman, but that took a backseat to battles, war-planning, and understanding the gods. And even though there was a big focus on the gods/war, I still didn’t really feel like it was THAT complex of an issue, so this plot wasn’t as gripping as I expected. It wasn’t bad, but the best parts about DV are the characters and romance so I think when reading this I was always waiting for more of those moments.To add to the point above, the first 60% of this story was a bit slow.There was nothing wrong with it, but I think since the focus was more on the war instead of the romance, and then since Roman and Iris were separated for so long (less dialogue between them), the plot just felt like it dragged a little. I get why this was a more war focused story and why Iris and Roman were separated for so long, but it just didn’t give me that all consuming reading experience I felt with the first book.I also think maybe I just need to reread this and go at a slower pace instead of reading for 7 straight hours. I think if I wasn’t in such a rush to get to the end and find out exactly how Iris and Roman’s love story ended, I might enjoy the journey a little bit more - including the war/gods plot. So expect an update in my review at some point.But overall, this is a great sequel and conclusion to the story!

For the girls who feel so deeply that sometimes it hurts just to be alive. For the girls who dream hard but live harder. For the girls who’ve been inspired by stories and inspire others in turn. For the girls who understand the power of words.These books are the kind of books that remind me why I love reading so much. I was brought back to the days of curling up on my grandma’s couch with a book (likely Narnia) in my hands for days on end. From the first page of Divine Rivals, I was hopelessly invested and now, after finishing Ruthless Vows, I’m in tears beyond the point of professional help. Something about the writing and the characters just pulls at my heartstrings and connects with me on a level I haven’t felt in a long time. I really felt like this book was written for me.Anyway, I guess I should pull myself together enough to actually write a review but bear with me because I’m barely hanging on at this point. Forgive me, Rebecca Ross. I will never be able to write a review deserving of this literary masterpiece.First of all, I just would like to say that this is by far the best romance I’ve ever read in my life. I’m not exactly a romance reader but I’m a romantic person who has spent all of 2023 (well, at least half) pining over fictional fantasy men and crying over Kanej. However, no ship will ever be able to compare to how I feel about Roman and Iris. They are so dear, precious, and beloved to me and there isn’t a week that goes by that I haven’t (and won’t) think about them. They are the definition of soulmates and have restored my faith in true love (as well as many other books I read this year :)That brings me to the characters who, if you haven’t noticed, are beautiful and lovely and all things good. If you’re here then that means you’ve likely read Divine Rivals and most certainly know that exact feeling I’m talking about. Rebecca Ross does an absolutely amazing job of establishing relatable and complex characters and i felt so connected to them. I would sell my soul for my babies and I’m being 100% honest about that.And then the writing. Omg guys how do I even put words to how I feel about the writing. Rebecca’s writing feels like painting on a spring day in a field of wildflowers (does that make any sense?) and is so mystical and beautiful. Her writing is emotional and raw and perfectly conveys her equally beautiful story. I wanted to include quotes in here but I realized that 1) I have to many and 2) I want you all to be able to experience them for the first time when you read the book (although I do have a few in my earlier updates 😉).The world building was also amazing and really expanded from what is was last book. In general, I felt like the magical, fantasy aspects were focused on a lot more in this book (not that I felt like it was lacking in DV). For those who wanted more world-building in the first book, you will be pleasantly surprised.This book is my Roman Empire (get it?). It is my life. I want all of Roman and Iris’s beautiful tear-stained love letters plastered onto my wall and I hope that all of my book girlies out there get boys like Roman Kitt to write us those love letters. We deserve it. This book was an emotionally traumatizing experience (I’ve never cried so much while reading a book) but it was worth it. It was the ending that they deserved.I will now be taking a short hiatus from normal life to pick up the broken pieces of myself.🎶 invisible string 🎶P. S.

First off ik ik this review is like 3 months later after I read the book back in early January. 💀 🙈 But I’m going to try and remember as much as I can for this review without spoiling anything. I’m going to be honest and say that I was upset how much I waited for this book and it didn’t deliver. 🥺 Like some parts were good but then other parts I felt like were overdone or not elaborated enough. For the rating I gave it 3 starswhich is kinda generous nglbut tbh i felt kinda bad giving this book like a 1 when divine rivals was so good and this one was kinda bad. So, I gave it a 3, one for the characters, one for the romance, and one bc I felt bad 😭 The characters were all good and so was the romance I just felt like it was missing something and the ending was too rushed. God knows the emotions were definitely there because I was crying my eyes reading this book. 😥🤧\xa0 So, they nailed that but they could’ve given Iris and Roman a better ending. Like the ending was really bittersweet. Overall I would say that people should read it tho to see how they feel about it. After the Divine Rivals ending, its kinda hard to not want to know what happens.🌸Main Characters🌸♡Iris *Little Flower*♡She is such an icon. 👑 After everything she went through she was so ready to go fight for Roman, even if that meant fighting for the other side. Story after story she wrote even when they told her she couldn’t. I feel like in this book Iris kind’ve branched out even more. In the last book it was about intros and trying to develop the romance between the two and in this one it's about them fighting to keep their future. So, I would say they’ve done a good job building up to that but as for them being together they didn’t really give a lot of Roman and Iris moments together. Like I really loved reading about all the things Iris did as an individual or with her friends but I wanted more of an interaction between her and Kitt.♡Roman♡He really is such a cute and cuddly teddy bear. 🧸I feel like they didn’t do enough for his character. One you made him forget everything and then like he was walking around like a zombie. All he had to rely on was his typewriter and the letters from someone he didn’t really remember. And when he did, the majority of the time was spent trying to hide the fact that he remembers his old life. I think this was where I felt like something was missing. Like Roman should’ve been developed more for this book. Ik he was going through some stuff but he needed more interaction with the outside world besides just Dacre. I love Roman but this book just didn’t do him justice after that ending in divine rivals.😭🌸Side Characters🌸Attie and Marisol are my heart. I love their friendship with Iris. It just brought sm positivity to the book despite the war and everything else going on. And Tobias and Attie were so cute. Forest was kind of annoying in the beginning especially after he dragged her away from Roman. That scene was a lot. 😭 But later on he kinda grew on me. And for those of you who know what happened…. Like what I was saying before when I felt like things were rushed and got crazy. I felt like this was a good example of that. I’m not even going to talk about Dacre I hate that guy sm!! And Enva…like I kinda get her character and then I kinda don’t. I kept forgetting that this is like a greek mythology with all the gods stuff. It just seemed so realistic and then wardrobes and gods would be brought up and then you have to remember this is a fantasy romance novel.🌸Best Couple Moments🌸♡When they asked each other the 3 questions to see if they remember each other♡The letters♡Their happy ending (somewhat)♡Praying to see one another again soon🌸Favorite Quotes🌸♡“People are allowed to have their own opinions and beliefs on divinity, whether they worship them or not. We can’t control that.”♡“Are you safe? Are you well? I can’t stop thinking about you. I can’t stop worrying about you.” (Iris)♡“I have kept you to myself; no one knows of you but me. No one knows of our connection and I want to keep it that way.” (Roman)♡“The problem is…..I want to hear from you at all hours. I want to read your words. I am greedy for them. I am hungry for them.” (Roman)♡“Let me be your secret, then. Tuck my words into your pocket. Let them be your armor.” (Iris)♡“I pray that my days will be long at your side. Let me fill and satisfy every longing in your soul. May your hand be in mine, by sun and by night. Let our breaths twine and our blood become one, until our bones turn to dust. Even then, may I find your soul still sworn to mine.” (Their wedding vows)♡“Should I be surprised that I was falling in love with you a second time?” (Roman)♡“I would love to see your words catch fire with mine.” (Roman)♡“Write me a story, Kitt. Write me a story where you keep me up late every night with your typing, and I hide messages in your pockets for you to find when you’re at work. Write me a story where we first met on a street corner, and I spilled coffee on your expensive trench coat, or when we crossed paths at our favorite bookshop, and I recommended poetry, and you recommend myths. Write me a story where there is no ending, Kitt. Write to me and fill my empty spaces. (Iris)🌸Last Thoughts🌸It’s a shame that this one couldn’t live up to Divine Rivals. But I think it was a nice closure to the series. Its easier now knowing that they got somewhat of a good ending. I just wish it could have been better. However I will always love the story of Iris and Roman no matter what. And they will always have a special place in my heart. 💗💗💗Letters of Enchantment Full Series ReviewDivine Rivals: ♾🌟'sDefinitely the best on in the series The chemistry was in point and it was such a beautiful beginning to Iris and Roman's story. 💘💖💗Ruthless Vows: 3🌟'sUnfortunately even after we waited forever for it, it didn't deliver the way we thought. However its nice to know that they have somewhat of a good ending. ❤Would I do a reread? Probably only the 1st one I just felt that one had more romance with the two and eventho it has that shocking ending ik now what happens so its will be easier to process again.

Write to me and fill my empty spaces.”Divine Rivals will always have a hold on my heart, but sadly, this didn\'t live up to my expectations. Don\'t get me wrong, I love Rebecca\'s writing as it is so beautifully written and just poetic, and I would probably read her grocery list and fall in love. Ruthless Vows was just lacking so much. I know that my review of DR mentioned that the fantasy was missing some pieces, but this was based almost entirely on the war and gods. I wanted more of the romance that I fell in love with and made me adore the first book wholeheartedly. I truly wanted to love this so much because Romaniris deserve the world and nothing less than 5 stars and more. I changed the rating from 3 stars to 3.5 solely for them alone.Ruthless Vows is the conclusion in the Letters of Enchantment Duet. It is a slow burn that is filled with angst, playful banter, protectiveness, and pain, and the romance was top tier when it was present.Iris Winnow is back in Oath working at the newspaper Inkridden Tribune. She has lost contact with her beloved husband Roman Kitt when she returned home from the frontlines of the war two weeks ago with her brother. The war continues between the two gods, Dacre and Enva. Her boss has asked her to return to the frontlines to repot on the happenings of the war and the movements of Dacre. Iris jumps at the opportunity in hopes that while reporting, she will also reunite with Roman.Irismy precious girl. I can\'t say it enough how much I admire her strength and bravery. She has endured so much and still tries to be positive and not let it all eat away at her. She goes to great lengths to make sure the ones she cares for are taken care of in every way that is possible for her to accomplish. Always putting the needs of her loved ones first. I just love and adore her so much. She is honestly my favorite female main character. It will take a lot to change my mind on this.“If my words have bewitched your son, then know that his possess the same magic for me”Romanis my dream man. I love him with my heart. He is so strong, sweet, compassionate, and just a gentleman. I mean, he waits for her to get inside her building before leaving. This is the sweetest gesture that has me melting for him. My heart hurt so much for him when he was dealing with his pain and tried his hardest to hide it.""The problem is… I want to hear from you at all hours. I want to read your words. I am greedy for them. I am hungry for them.""Romaniristhey are the definition of true love, and I said it before and will say it again. These two define what soulmates are. They hold so many feelings, passion, and chemistry for each other, but I didn\'t feel it for most of the book. It saddens me because the love that they share was felt so much before. I just wish we would have had more of their romance and sooner. I adore what they have. It literally makes me weak in the knees and swoon. The number of times that I just wanted to wrap my arms around them both gave them the biggest hugs with all they had to endure to get back to one another.""Their souls weren’t mirrors but complements, constellations that burned side by side.Side charactersThe found family that is shown is so heartwarming. I loved the moments that we got withAttie, Tobias, Sarah, and Forest.I will say that I was so mad at Forest, but now I understand why he did what he had. I kind of didn\'t care for Marisol and Keegan in this as to me their characters changed, which upsets me because I love them before.There were a couple of things that I disliked. The main one is the gods. I could care less about more detail with them and the war, and this is mostly what we got for most of the book. I just felt that all of that wasn\'t needed. The other is that my interset wasn\'t held until after the first half of the book when it started to pick up. I felt myself not wanting to read. I would read a chapter and put my Kindle down. This was not the case with DR, I couldn\'t put it down. I was already feeling a slump when I started this and swore that Romaniris would pull me out, but it actually began to get worse at some points.What I loved most about this was first of all the letters because I\'m a sucker for letters in a book, especially love letters. However, they weren\'t the letters that I fell in love with before they were not the same. While I understand the circumstances were different, they could have still poured their heart and soul into them to each other. I still need someone to write me some. They were still enjoyable to me. Outside of the letters, though, there were a couple of things that stuck out to me the most and that I loved. Chapter 35 is definitely one part that I loved. I would have loved to have stayed there because I live and breathe for that chapter alone. I was literally smiling so hard and screaming of happiness here. Chapter 49 gave the thoughts of what others were thinking while the war was happening. I could feel the emotions that they were feeling at this time.That ending had me in tears from moments of sadness to moments of happiness. I\'m ecstatic that they got their happy ending and am hoping for more of them in the future. If not their own book or novella, then a spin-off with Attie and Tobias. I just want more Roman and Iris, period.Favorite quotes/moments""You may not be a goddess, but nor am I a god.

The writing in both of these books was on a completely different level than RR's other books, though I've enjoyed the others I've read too. Everything feels so grounded and flows so effortlessly 🩵This storyline didn't focus so much on the actual war as the first one did, in that Roman and Iris were pretty far removed from it from most of the book, so I think some of the wright fell off on this one. But there were plenty of heart stopping scenes to move everything along pretty smoothly.My biggest complaint and reason for my rating is the distance between Roman and Iris. They had nowhere near as many scenes together as DR, depriving us of their epic banter and admittedly swoonworthy prose.All in all, a great duology and I wonder if RR will expand on the universe at all?

A magic spell usually requires reciting an incantation and while we seal a marriage with a kiss the spoken vows are what unites us. Words are the closest thing to magic we have in this life andRuthless Vows, the second and concluding volume of Ross’ Letters of Enchantment series certainly champions the written word as a force of hope, courage, or even ‘a shield to protect me.’ Jumping in just days after the shocking conclusion toDivine Rivals,Ruthless Vowsbrings us a story of the strength, sorrow, sacrifice but also of love that can ‘burn with splendor’ and might be enough to bring an end to a vicious war writ large by divine forces, or are the immortal powers too great to contend with?Ruthless Vowsis an emotional labyrinth of twists and touching character development that effectively reverses the roles in its predecessor novel and guides it towards a shocking yet satisfying conclusion. This is a love story built on language as much as it is a love letter to language and it filled my heart with bliss to read this lovely second half of an epic adventure.‘The sun would continue setting and rising , the moon would persist in waxing and waning , the seasons would bloom and molt , and the war would still rage until one god or both fell to their grave.’Admittedly, I foundDivine Rivalsto be a stronger novel if we take each separately in their own context, thoughRuthless Vowsdoes bring a great conclusion to this tale while still leaving just enough to speculation to give our minds a reason to continue wrestling with these stories as if in perpetuity. It is once again framed around the charming and heartfelt romance between Iris and Kitt who’s ‘souls weren’t mirrors but complements, constellations that burned side by side’ that gives us a marvelously strong emotional handhold to weather the tumult and turmoil of the war raging across the narrative. Their love story is beautiful and pure and you can’t ask for a better pair of characters to root for. Especially when they deliver tender lines such as:‘May your hand be in mine, by sun and by night. Let our breaths twine and our blood become one, until our bones return to dust.’Essentially these books are two people thinking “wow the way you write stirs me into the blossoming of love” which is pretty charming and they fall for the mannerisms of the mind before they even know the poetry of the body. I love the union of language to be a bond that transcends the physical, and enjoy the beauty of the ideas ‘I would love to see your words catch fire with mine.’. But the language of love and epistolary romance is what drives this book and this is a book ‘for anyone who sought a different realm through a wardrobe door,’ as Ross writes, a book for those ‘who wrote a letter and is still waiting for a reply, Or who dreams of stories and bleeds words.’ Which is always something I can root for. Especially coupled with the framing that it is their words reaching out across space and time ‘that your words found me here, even in the darkness,’ and become an emotional compass to guide one another through the hardest moments. As if it was meant to be, cosmically ordained and bestowed upon them through their shared love of making the world more beautiful one perfect phrase after another. A feat they can only accomplish together. ‘[H]is best words emerged,’ Roman realizes, ‘when he was with her.’‘was only thinking how strange it is. To think how many people we cross paths with in our lives. How someone like me has found someone like you.’What logophile wouldn’t swoon, as many did in the first volume. And Here, however, the roles are reversed with Kitt uncertain who is writing to him—Iris using her middle name was a nice touch as it recalled Roman’s use of Carver but also fit her need for secrecy as this is war and loose lips sink ships as they say—and it manages to keep the romantic tension high without feeling recycled either as the dramatic events keep rolling in.‘Did you think I would let him steal this last moment from me? When I surrender only to you, take you in my hands and burn with you before the end comes?’WhileDivine Rivalswas more slow-burn character development,Ruthless Vowsreally hits the ground running through a more plot-driven narrative that is, admittedly, still sort of a slow-burn. Personally I prefer the interpersonal dramas over the war drama but this does drive towards a rather satisfying conclusion that pulls all the small threads from the first book into a brilliant and dynamic full picture. The book plays with a lot of dualities that really make the plot sing too, with Forrest and Kitt’s “condition” due to Dacre’s magic (no spoilers but the uneasiness about Forrest lends an uneasiness about Kitt that reminded me a bit of Peeta fromMockingjay), but also the duality of relationships like Iris/Roman, Forrest/Sarah or Attie/Tobias juxtaposed with the fallout from Dacre/Enva makes the reader contemplate how each is better together but always at the risk of collapse or tragedy.‘Keep writing. You will find the words you need to share. They are already within you, even in the shadows, hiding like jewels.’That duality extends further into the craft of the duology itself. You can’t have one without the other, which is why the novels hinge at such a cliff-hanger moment. You have to combine them for them to make their magic, like ingredients in a potion, like Roman and Iris. It is also perhaps why Iris seems the strongest character in the first and we stretch out in her head a bit more whereas in this volume it is more Roman’s struggle in his captive state and emotional turbulence to keep aloft.And, as this is a war novel, sacrifices will unfortunately befall our merry band of lovers. Though this also gives a necessary weight to the story and all the twists and tragedies make the pay-off land with a greater blow as Ross reminds us that war always comes at an all too great of cost. ‘I see the beauty in what has been but only because I have tasted both sorrow and joy in equal measures’ is a line just as applicable to the experience of reading this series. Ideally one should think of this as the second half of a story rather than a sequel and I’d be curious how this book would read if it were bound as one full volume. That said I think taking a bit of a break between them was beneficial for my own reading habits and I didn’t find this one quite as engaging so I took forever to read it, but it almost feels more like, say, how the recent Dune films are just two parts to a continuous story not a sequel. But I did like how this fleshed out the world, especially the magic realms. Though I also wish this had a map of Cambria. Who doesn’t love a good fantasy world map. Maps even come up. A lot.‘Tuck my words into your pocket. Let them be your armor.’For those who found the world building a bit flat in the first, rest assured a lot of the little ideas that pop up get much more grounding here. The enchanted buildings, for instance, play a larger role in this novel and have a rather well-executed explanation that makes sense to have saved until later. But as we get more detail about what we already know, we also discover the world is much more vast and layered than we initially thought as well. An intricate magic system around how the gods function and move about the works is unveiled and it threatens the Cambria as the characters know it as much as if reorders the readers own understanding of it.‘I would betray you a thousandfold for her.’While this is more a personal preference than a criticism, I did like the gods more when they were offstage and still potentially more metaphor than physical presence. Or even a halfway point may have been preferred, something like a Sauron that is menacing and omnipresent without having to interact much. Once we have Dacre moving through the text it was nice to have him humanzied but it also reduced his menace, sort of how Randall Flagg is more menacing as an idea than a character with flaws, foibles and finicky temperament in King’sThe Stand. Also Enva was cool but it was almost too little and too late with her character compared to Dacre. I did, however, really enjoy the way she shifts the closure of the story in ways that don’t need a sequel, though a prequel would be welcomed. Better yet short stories about the gods, who we learn more of but only get half histories. The overall ending was mostly satisfying if a bit predictable and aiming more for a happy ending instead of an emotional impact with a message, but it still managed to pull off both for the most part.‘I look forward to the next chapter. The one you will write in your story, as well as the one we write together.’Overall, I found the Letters of Enchantment duology to be a delightful time full of magic and marvel where the charming romance truly carried the weight brilliantly.Ruthless Vowsgets into some pretty intense territory with war crimes and and the fallout of choosing sides (Kitt’s story also enters some pretty gritty aspects of being caught between a rock and a hard place that has echoes ofKurt Vonnegut’s undercover broadcaster inMother Night). There’s some gripping tales of betrayal and cloak and dagger maneuvers as a war rages on and information is worth more than gold. I greatly enjoyed the importance of language too and how Ross shows the importance of journalism in framing conflict and how this can quickly be weaponized into propaganda. But most of all, I loved the love story that burns brightly in all the darkness. A fantastic read that is greater than the sum of its two parts, a moving story, and one I won’t soon forget.3.5/5‘Write me a story where there is no ending, kitt. write to me and fill my empty spaces.’'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""I'm forever undone.Do you hear that?

I swear it took me 4 days to finish this even though I was anticipating this release so much to the point where I planned on binging this in a day but my gosh I was so tired reading this.I dozed off the majority of the first half of the book, but around the middle it somewhat got better. I wouldn’t say this was a terrible read, but it didn’t give me that overwhelming, emotional, and tense feeling like Divine Rivals did. I felt so underwhelmed reading this one… and that ending just made me more dissatisfied.I’m gonna be honest… I came here solely for the romance and not for the conflict between the gods. The romance was non-existent in this book (besides that one chapter) but it was mostly the gods. Though I mean it wasn’t that bad, but the war between the gods just wasn’t as satisfying as I thought it would have been, it was boring af. Dacre was literally the main character atp and IrisRoman just felt like the background characters or subs. The plot was so messy that it felt so confusing. The amnesia trope lacked plot, it was so random. It was missing that angst, and longing feeling between RomanIris. It was so draggy, nothing really happened regarding that. This trope didn’t happen in the way she had hoped it would but things were still somewhat fine.Even though this wasn’t the best book, I will say I did enjoy some of the romantic scenes we got from Roman and Iris, I will always eat those up. And oh my gosh Rebecca’s writing was truly out of this world, it was breathtaking as always. I fell in love with her poetic and lyrical style of writing again. Even though this one didn’t do it for me, it was still good in some parts.╰┈➤ 𝐐����𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐬 𝐈’𝐥𝐥 𝐥𝐨𝐯𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫""𝙄𝙛 𝙢𝙮 𝙬𝙤𝙧𝙙𝙨 𝙝𝙖𝙫𝙚 𝙗𝙚𝙬𝙞𝙩𝙘𝙝𝙚𝙙 𝙮𝙤𝙪𝙧 𝙨𝙤𝙣, 𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙣 𝙠𝙣𝙤𝙬 𝙩𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙝𝙞𝙨 𝙥𝙤𝙨𝙨𝙚𝙨𝙨 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙨𝙖𝙢𝙚 𝙢𝙖𝙜𝙞𝙘 𝙛𝙤𝙧 𝙢𝙚.""""𝙏𝙝𝙚 𝙥𝙧𝙤𝙗𝙡𝙚𝙢 𝙞𝙨...

I am completely and utterly shattered.😭💔These 2 books have honestly helped me heal parts of my own self and work through my own journey of grief.Reading about grief, while grieving myself would help me sit with my own feelings around my own experience and go through the motions.I lost my partner 7 months ago and I had first read Divine Rivals right before Christmas, it was an extremely fragile and vulnerable time for me, being the holidays and obviously having spent all my holidays with him for the last several years, naturally I was not coping well at the time.Divine Rivals took me out of a very dark place during Christmas, I have a lot of respect and love for stories and books because of what it can do for a person\'s psychology, especially when they\'re in such a deep, dark and lonely place. It took me a little while to read Ruthless Vows because I truly knew I was going to feel the same way reading this book, as I had reading the first, in terms of stirring up my feelings around my grief and addressing it.I really love how beautifully Rebecca Ross wrote about grief in both of these books, they felt really precious and special and it felt very gentle to read. I think that\'s what made it a lot harder to read for someone like me in my situation, but when I say that, I mean that in the best possible way. I cried, re-read parts over and over and paused and took breaks when I had to, to collect my mind during this book because I related so much to certain parts of both book 1 & 2.I appreciated these books so much, to my core.I think I appreciated this one a little more because RR took me by surprise by not only continuing Iris\' journey of grief but expanding on it in Ruthless Vows. It made it that much harder to read, but also so much more humbling. ❤️\u200d🩹These two books hold a really special place in my heart for sentimental reasons, and I can\'t believe how emotionally captivated and invested I felt reading these. I struggled a lot, I think a lot more than I would like to admit, it had me reminiscing a lot as well as everything else it had me experiencing and feeling.I feel really humbled reading these 2 books, I think it\'s the best way to describe it. They are so beautifully written and so special. 🩷I am truly in awe of Rebecca Ross\' writing, she\'s another one of my favourite authors, for how incredibly skilled she is at transporting me into a whole nother realm.🩷.·:*¨༺ ༻¨*:·.➻ “𝘓𝘦𝘵 𝘮𝘦 𝘣𝘦 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘴𝘦𝘤𝘳𝘦𝘵, 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘯.

I excepted so much from it but it didn’t meet my expectations. There was so many lacks in the first book that i thought this one was going to cover them but i was wrong. The half of the book was very slow the book only started for me from the middle of part too! There was so many parts that felt underwhelming and didn’t make sense.I expected more of the gods giving their power and their stories in book one. But they just felt like humans to me. Especially enva ( there was no role for her in this book she literally did nothing!!) And I wanted to hear more of forest story.I wanted more dopth to the other characters. I wanted so many things that I didn’t get😞But i still enjoyed it though. And the last few chapters broke me. The 3 stars are for Romaniris and Romaniris alone.

They were adorable yet flawed and we got to see a lot of character growth while experiencing their wholesome You’ve Got Mail but with magical typewriters love story unfurl. I was hoping to experience the same magic in Ruthless Vows. And to a degree, it delivered. There is no doubt Rebecca Ross' lyrical prose is lush and stirs up all the emotions.So why the 3 stars? (3 stars aren’t bad. It’s still good, not great.)Maybe it's partly because I was on holiday and not binge-reading like usual, but honestly, the first 40% was a bit of a slog, holiday or not. Still, I stuck with it, hoping for that Divine Rivals magic to kick in. And it did. It just took a while.🚨My thoughts below are riddled with spoilers for both Divine Rivals & Ruthless Vows🚨What I liked:→ What I really appreciated was that the final chapters and epilogue didn’t need pregnancy or babies for the HEA. I always find that unnecessary, cringey and overdone. So big props to Ms. Ross there.→ We get to see a lot more of Attie in Ruthless Vows, allowing us a deeper glimpse into her character and introducing pivotal figures that enrich her storyline.→ Semi-familiar faces, like Marisol, Keegan, Forest, Helena, and even Roman's father, make a return in broader roles which added more depth.→ The inclusion of multiple points of view towards the end was a nuanced perspective, and the ending felt like a mix of fair, joyful, poignant and fitting mostly, given the fantasy wartime setting.What could’ve been improved:Firstly, I had so many unfulfilled questions and I needed more detail.→ The biggest question was around Dacre & Enva and their whole backstory and the entire cause for a senseless war killing millions of innocent civilians. Because there were so many questions I had about the “why”, that part of the story just didn't resonate for me. I still don't get the reason behind the war that well. I needed stronger motivations, backstory and fleshing out of both Dacre and Enva to make them feel three-dimensional. Maybe that's why Dacre felt like a caricature with SDE. Also, maybe just go to therapy or see a divorce counsellor instead of going on a killing spree?→ More detail would’ve also elevated the worldbuilding for me. The underground realm for example didn’t quite hit the mark. When we’re talking about an entire underground magical realm connected to the real world via various magical ley lines, tunnels, levels, secret passages and doors, I craved richer detail to immerse me more.→ Secondly, some romantic lines and scenes were a bit too saccharine for me: “Their souls weren’t mirrors but complements, constellations that burned side by side.” This is a subjective opinion/ “it’s a me thing”, so please don’t come after me with pitchforks. Diversity of opinion is what makes GoodReads fun!→ In terms of sub-plots, there was a missed opportunity here for a skilled musician (looking at Attie here) to save the eithrals (dragons), who we realise are captive to Dacre and respond to music.Finally, the telling and not showing ratio was a bit too much for me.Overall, the book had its moments and was mostly enjoyable, but I felt there was a lot of untapped potential and I was a lot more rapt with Divine Rivals. Nonetheless, I am keen to explore more of Rebecca Ross’ catalogue because her prose is just lovely stuff.Ruthless Vows musings & blog|Amazon reviews.___The real gift to myself on Boxing Day to help me avoid awkward family conversations.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""⊹ ࣪ ˖❝ I would love to see your words catch fire with mine. ❞˖ ࣪ ⊹Alexa, play Timeless by Taylor Swift on repeat.Where do I even start?I was definitely nervous going into this book, for two reasons mainly. 1) Before reading I had seen a lot of negative reviews so I was anxious it wouldn’t deliver and 2) I was terrified my babies wouldn’t get the happy ending they deserved. Now, I see I didn’t need to be nervous. Ruthless Vows exceeded my expectations 100%, although it wasn’tquiteas good as Divine Rivals (but let’s be real, no book can be as good). As for the ending… well, you’ll have to read for yourself to find out🤭J.K. Rowling once said,“I do believe something very magical can happen when you read a good book.”To me, the true magic of reading is falling in love with people in your favorite stories who aren’t real but seem more real to you then anything.

I loved how we got more insight on the gods. It felt like I could better understand them and their perspective (although Darce definitely got what he deserved, no regrets there.) I was seriously super scared during the climax, to the point where I dreaded turning the page in fear of something terrible happening. But I’m still alive right now so clearly nothingtootraumatizing happened. Although that one death did make me really sad. Also, can we talk about Ross’ writing?

I swear I've been admiring that last chapter ever since I finished it 😂😭 I had definitely stopped breathing, especially when the name of certain someone appeared.Firstly, Kudos to Sarah for writing such a masterpiece. I think it's going to be one of the best reads of 2022. I don't think I've read a bad review of it so far and rightly so. The book starts off at a good pace which she maintained throughout, especially compared to House of Earth and Blood. This was so much better than what I had expected. If I could have given more than 5 stars, I would.What really interested me was the character development of Hunt, Tharion and Ruhn in particular. Their journey is one worthy of praise. Hunt's power and Ruhn's purity is commendable. Tharion ended up being my favourite, I enjoyed his struggles and his tough decisions, it brought more personality to the limelight. I was hoping he would've made a different choice at the end but it's going to be interesting to see what direction his story takes. Bryce was as usual badass. It was so good to see how she was struggling with Danika's constant secrets, it made her seem more human, instead of a robotic push over. What lays ahead of her in the series is going to be so good to see. There was a lot of foreshadowing done, can't wait to see how it unfolds. Cormac was a nice addition. Ithan and his struggles are shown well and the way he's welcomed into the group is just heartwarming to see. Flynn and Declan as usual are underrated supporting characters. I feel we don't give them much credit. The other supporting characters bring out great chemistry between the group as a whole. It just works out so well😩The plot as a whole had a lot of twists, some of which had me shocked but it works well together. Their world just got bigger and there are lot of possibilities to explore, I do wonder how Sarah would incorporate it all. It's going to be a challenge considering the fan expectations will hit the roof, but I bet she can pull it off.Also, if anything happens to Hunt and Bryce, Ruhn and Tharion, I'm SUING. 👀I already CANNOT WAIT for the third book in the series. It's going to be mind-blowing for sure.Through love, all is possible ❤️""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""I...I don't have the words. I'll try to write a review but bear with me.First, let me just say that if anything happens to Ruhn and Hunt I am going to riot. And yes, that's a threat.Ok, now to the review.This book stressed me. I can't even count the number of times I had to put it down and walk away for a minute because I was scared to read what happened next. Every time I thought I knew where the story was going, a whole other layer of complications and magic and worldbuilding was added to the mix. It was a rollercoaster in every way.While I did predict the outcome to several plot twists, like the identity of agent Daybright, there were a billion other twists that I didn't see coming, like that ending for which nothing could have prepared me for!!!!. And honestly, it's because half the time most of those twists were coming entirely out of left field and it was all Danika's fault!I was getting second-hand embarrassment for Bryce every time something new was revealed about her supposed 'best friend'. Danika had a whole secret life, filled with so many secrets and people that Bryce never knew about.After a while, it kinda felt like SJM just wanted to introduce new things and didn't know how so she threw them into Danika's bag of secrets and called it a day.But, whatever. What I was really here for, more than the plot twists, was the characters! Gosh darn it, I love all of these characters so much!!! I really wasn't kidding about rioting if anything happens to them.Ruhn was my favorite. I picked him out in book one as my comfort character in this series and I am way too invested in this man's well-being. Ruhn, Declan, Flynn, Ithan, and Tharion. I loved them. I loved the dynamic and I loved how Ruhn's house just kept getting more and more crowded and they all just accepted it like it was nothing. That brood of highly competent, badass idiots are all my babies and they better come out unscathed.Then there was Bryce and Hunt. I love them. The banter, the chemistry, loyalty, and love they have between them is everything.Nothing will ever come close. I was worried about Hunt, I'm not gonna lie. Sarah has a tendency to bait us into falling for one guy, just for another dude to come in for the win. But no, Bryce and Hunt were everything together. There's nothing else to say.Overall, this was great. I loved it. Not as much as I did the first book, I have to admit. But I loved it. And no, this wasn't really a review. I didn't even mention the plot of the novel, but if you've made it this far you probably already know what it's about.I just needed to gush about these characters for a bit since no one in real life will get excited and talk about these characters with me.So yeah. That is all. Go read this book. Talk about it with me in the comments. That ending left me with too many emotions. Goodbye.But before you go!My final question to this all, the one that has bothered me since book one and plagues me to this day:how does a faun dance ballet?Like actually though? You can't be on pointe with hooves and bent legs. Every time they mentioned June dancing my brain almost spontaneously combusted trying to conjure up a visual! At this point,I just assume that Juniper is to ballet, what Feyre is to painting and I'll leave it at that!""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'HELLO, YES. I FEEL SO VALIDATED NOW. Sarah really said: Hold my champagne, I’ve got work to do and hearts to destroy. Just ... I was right, y’all. I WAS RIGHT. It is 4am and I am reeling and I haven’t slept and just holy shit. Sarah did that.Also, can we just take a moment to appreciate the bro club in this book? Ruhn, Declan, Flynn, AND MY PRECIOUS ITHAN. Okay, Ruhn is still my favorite but ITHAN came out of left field, barreled into me with a boyish smirk and a wink, and next thing I knew I was on my knees *cough* He is a must protect. And Tharion and Cormac? SJM just working her magic, that’s all.Love Bryce and Hunt still of course, but SJM’s side characters have a way of jumping off the page and tunneling into your heart. This book is no exception.The romance delivers, the plot delivers, the EASTER EGGS, the tension, the camaraderie and humor and banter between characters delivers, and THE PLOT TWISTS!?! Holy mother of all plot twists. I mean, yes, I’ve definitely been wanting that and assumed it might be the case, but I didn’t actually expect SJM to do it AND make it so integral to the plot. It was unexpected, and I both loved it and immediately had mixed feelings because it opens a whole can of worms—but after another day of letting it all sink in, I am here for it. I’m excited, and game to see what comes next, and I know SJM has our backs.My theories are ABOUND and the connections I’ve been making in the time since finishing are off the charts.

I have no hesitation in giving 5 sensational stars for another mind blowing and epic fantasy that is possibly my favourite SJM novel yet.**** NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW ****Once again SJM has created an ending that is jaw-droppingly brilliant and one that all her fans are going to adore. We are just left speculating as to how SJM will tie all 'this' together, until the next book.A sensational story in the world of dark fantasy, that is magical and haunting, with an exhilarating plot, powerful world building, a level of suspense that inspires a hungry turn of pages and a brilliant array of characters that I believe are her best cast yet. Ingenious.The Plot“I’m guessing you’re in Sky and Breath.” She went still. Had he struck true? “Why do you say that?” “You remind me of the wind.” He tried to explain. “Powerful and able to cool or freeze with half a thought, shaping the world itself though no one can see you. Only your impact on things.”Sofie, is about to die with one vital piece of “information hidden in her head, information that could very well be the final piece of this war against the Asteri. The blow that could end it all” and so Bryce, Hunt and Ruhn try to unearth the corruption and the devastating truth that cost Danika her life in the last book and now Sofie in this story. This is not a spoiler as it happens in the first chapter but sets up a storyline that will continue well into the book.As worlds collide and the Houses of Crescent City seek to take control, the treachery and danger takes us to the city ships of the queen’s court, the seven levels of hell and the orrery planet solar system as reluctant alliances are forged to prevent the Asteri taking control.However, with an order from the Asteri to lie low or endure a penalty of death, the crew must carve out a strategy where the stakes are high, the game is at a different level, and the people only too willing to betray the daughter of the King of the Autumn Court too numerous.Ignoring the request from her father to strengthen the alliance with the House of Avallen, by marrying Cormac, her cousin, Bryce is left isolated except for her lover and ‘mate’ Hunt and brother Ruhn.Review and commentsWhat makes this my favourite Sarah Maas book yet!!!The Ending ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ The sensational ending just blew me away. I was left speechless and very happy knowing we have a fantastic set up going into the next book. If you have read other SJM series you will adore it. Although it is worth pointing out that you do not need to have read A Court of Thorns and Roses first.Storyline and Plot ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ The plot / subplots are complex, gripping, and captivating and written at a pace that never slows. I loved that multiple sub plots were introduced rather than having everything centred around the two main characters which has become a common thread in SJM’s books. However, I feel there is room to make these side stories with other people even stronger and shorter because at 800 pages it feels too long, hence the 4.5 stars.Main Characters ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Hunt and Ruhn are adorable, and although I liked Bryce much better in book 2, The connection is still not great. I would like to see the female characters portrayed differently from ‘bad ass bitches’.Writing Style ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Stunning writing and one I connect with although you need to pay attention given the number of subplots and wide ranging 'fantastical' names. However, for an immersive and absorbing read that captured me through the writing, then it can only be 5 stars.Imagination ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ I am in awe of SJM’s imagination. Ingenious, creative and explosive with settings like the seven levels of hell, orrery of planets and intricate details like the seven star and its representation, the glowing star on Bryce’s chest and symbolic nature of the marks and tattoos.For ‘Love and other words’ ⭐⭐⭐⭐ There is no shortage of passion between the main characters. What I loved about this part of the story was Bryce standing up for her right to choose her own ‘mate’ against her fathers wishes. Even better when she achieved this in such a clever way that blindsided everyone around her, including her father.Book length ⭐⭐ This was too long. The Court of Thorns and Roses was in average 500 pages and was just right. At a huge 800 pages this was too long and more importantly not all the content was needed although written well.Tormenting, imaginative, spellbinding, a fabulous game of brinkmanship, and totally immersive. A book I read over two days and up to ‘stupid o’clock’ in the morning to finish, because I hankered to know how it would all end, and what an ending it was - but no spoilers here!!!! And my advice is please do not read reviews that contain spoilers because the element of surprise will leave you speechless and very happy.I have to confess that this is my favourite book over two series, this and the Court of Thorns and Roses.Unbelievably good and highly recommended.__________________________________I have not re-read but my written review has disappeared so had to create under a new date that seems to have worked. How strange!!!__________________________________I have read so many fantasy books in the last few years that I needed to refresh myself on the characters, the plot and that ending from this second book in the Crescent City series I read almost 2 years ago. Why? because book 3 is out in January and I couldn't remember everything in the story.Happy to say, that I haven't changed my opinion of this book after the second read. It is fabulous and testament to its success is that I have chosen to reread rather than use my limited reading time on something new.

thoughts on this book:✧ bryce & hunt are stale asf.i loved them in the first book and their character development was really good and now it’s like sjm thinks she can just stop writing them well because they already had enough character development in the previous book. well, that’s not how it works. they are boring now and all they do is talk about having sex. their relationship is bland and i don’t even ship them anymore. i liked them in hoeab because they were friends first and then slowly grew to trust each other and be one another’s safe space and now they’re just oH sO pOWERfuL royalty bitches. they’re not an interesting couple, they have no chemistry or individual character development or relationship development and i don’t like how hunt is all possessive alpha male bullshit ok byesjm thinks she can make it okay that hunt is a bitchy protective asshole by bryce making fun of him for it, but that’s still his personality and i hate it. sjm if you actually believe that bryce can handle herself and doesn’t need an “alphahole” as you call it, (corny-ass name but whatever,) then make it so.⚠︎︎spoiler⚠︎︎ also: bryce doesn’t need to be a princess with 10388373 magical powers to be a badass, so fucking leave her alone sjm.✧ this world building sucks.nothing is ever explained. here i was thinking that this took place in only one city?? i don’t understand anything. there are a bunch of random terms and things thrown in here to make a plot and they are never explained whatsoever. sjm continually has to explain what’s going on to us because i don’t think she understands her own story all that well, but half of the things she mentions aren’t ever explained and i’m just left here to fend for myself.i liked the whole urban fantasy aspect of the first book, how it felt like an actual city and there was an atmosphere to it, but in this book i didn’t get any of that at all because the characters were constantly running around doing random shit in ‘realms’ that shouldn’t even exist smh✧ since every single person whose pov we get in this book is straight as a board, i’ll make a list of characters i was shippingthat i have evidence forthat have a 99.99% chance of not being canon because sjm won’t make any of her main characters diverse.♥︎ hunt x baxian (OKAY WHEN THEY WERE PLAYING VIDEO GAMES TOGETHER YALL CANT TELL ME THAT WAS PLATONIC) (literally #1 ship in this book xoxo)♥︎ hunt x ruhn (brother in law romance 😍) (anyway how ruhn continuously warms up to hunt bEcAusE hEs wItH bRyCe mhm sure keep telling yourself that)♥︎ tharion x ithan (these two did so much running around investigating together)♥︎ ruhn x ithan (didn’t ruhn invite ithan to live with him or was that someone else)♥︎ cormac x tharion (CORMAC LITERALLY DID SOME SELF SACRIFICING BULLSHIT FOR THARION DONT TELL ME THEYRE NOT MADLY IN LOVE)♥︎ literally everyone in the group of cormac, tharion, ithan, ruhn, hunt (except for cormac and ruhn obviously because they’re cousins)♥︎ bryce x danika (dont fucking tell me they were jUst fRieNds)♥︎ the hind x the viper queen (LISTEN i know these two have probably never met but IMAGINE THE TENSION)♥︎ danika x sophie (they were doomed lovers)✧ SOMEBODY TAKE - AND … AWAY FROM SJMSHE NEEDS TO BE STOPPEDyou’d think after more than 10 books she would improve her writing style but nope. in this books she used almost word for word sentences from acomaf 😭 please she’s plagiarizing her own series 💀💀✧ “you’re a princess 👸🏻 YOURE a princess 😍 EVERYONES A PRINCESS ✨you have magical powers 💥 and YOU have magical 🧙\u200d♀️ powers ⚡️ EVERYONE has magical powers 🪄”it gets tiring, i’ll tell you that.⚠︎︎spoilers⚠︎︎ i liked it better when bryce was a messy person who had everyone see her as a shallow party girl so that they wouldn’t see the hurt inside her from losing her best friend (lover)✧ the plot is so far gone at this point.all of the things i said previously about the world building also apply to the plot. it doesn’t make sense and it’s trying to make us “surprised” every time something happens even though nothing is surprising at this point because so much random stuff is going on and apparently absolutely anything is possible.it seems like we’re focusing on one thing and then we’ll abruptly move to something else and the whole thing is just really confusing. there’s also way too much running around trying to fiGuRe sTufF out, like why do y’all even care about what’s going on with the rEbeLLioN anyway it has basically nothing to do with you 😐like is this harry potter or something y’all are acting like 12 year olds✧ has anyone noticed how many male characters there are in relation to the number of female characters?there are about 6 different male characters whose pov we get and one (1) female character. and OF COURSE everyone oversexualizes her and seventy five percent of the male characters are in love with her.one of the male characters (who calls her Legs) says at one point, “it’s bryce. everyone has a thing for her.”like ok is she just here to be sexualized by everyone now or what(and i love thatsheowns her sexuality but it’s kinda gross seeing all these male povs talk about how hot she is etc etc it just feels very male gaze-y and we don’t like objectification of women)✧ the sex scenes that everyone thinks are “sooooo hot” for some reason are underwhelming asf.it’s literally not hot to start talking about stars and oceans in the middle of a smut scene. i literally don’t understand. sjm does that in every single one of her books like why do you have to bring magic into it??and fire???and snow??like “the stars swam around us… the oceans rose and the golden dust on our planet lifted up to brush against our souls. the leaves on the trees fell and the wind… the wind swept us together until our magic fused together and-and we were flying, with galaxies swirling- and our power becoming… becoming one.”there will be something like that right in the middle of a smut scene. like sweetie 😐 that’s 😐 not hot 😐but good for y’all who have mountains shaking at you while you’re having sex✧ okay i DID like the night & day thing sue mei knew who day was the whole time but i SIMP for that character so idec 😩🤚ruhn seems like one of the more decent men in this series and he has pretty good character development so i actually didn’t mind reading about him. his relationship with day was a little bit insta love but they also had chemistry so it worked ig.the whole reveal was pretty great too even though i already knew who day was (i read spoilers and read the ends of books first because i have no self control ha)for the most part i support that ship and they’re a lot better than watching bryce and hunt try to be sexy when they are actually just stale 💀✧ i really don’t like how all the ‘males’ growl and are all protective of the ‘females’ like stfuit just gives me icky vibes and since bryce even knows she doesn’t want hunt and other guys acting like that and she even tells them so, and they act like that anyways and she just accepts it and has to deal with them i didn’t like the message that gives at all. like if she was on her own she could be much freer and do what she wants more.it helps a little that bryce also gets protective over hunt sometimes but it’s not really the same and i still feel like alot of the ways sjm writes these things gives sexist vibes.maybe this is just personal preference because i don’t at all like protective male characters in my books but i’m just sick of couples and male characters being written like that.✧ even if i don’t feel like most of sjm’s characters are written well at all,here are the ones i simp for:❥ lidia❥ fury❥ ruhn❥ the viper queen❥ aidas❥ danika❥ celestinaok wow there are a lot of hot people i won’t lieanywaysputting myself through 800 pages of this mess was worth it to write this review because i am honestly having so much fun ahahahsjdjdj☞︎ also i might be done with sjmbut some

This damn cover is everything!!!'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Final reread before CC3: January 16 2024New rating 3.5/5In my previous review I mentioned that I would most likely never pick up CC 2 again...and boy am I happy that I did. Reading this novel knowing what happens at the end, the spoilers, who everyone really is...is a completely different experience. My mistake when I first read CC2 was that I had completely forgotten what happened in the first instalment. Now, in 2024, I read CC2 right after CC 1 and wow...I understand everything so much better. All together, I had a much better reading experience the second time around and I am so happy that I gave this book a proper shot.Yes, some things in my previous review are still correct. The plot was not solidified well, there was alot of filler information and people, the POVs were confusing, and it felt very male centered....however, I cannot deny that craft and thought behind the entirety of the novel. SJM is just too damn good. Even though the middle still dragged on like crazy, reading it while knowing the ending had me reading between the lines.I did not expect to enjoy it so much. maybe it was the excitement of CC3 coming out in two weeks, but I truly appreciate the work and time this must have taken to write. I feel bad that i despised my first read so much, I despise that I began to skim throughout and missed out on the full experience of the novel.At the end of the day, SJM is just so intentional. I love how she brings everything full circle. She is one of the best fantasy writers in this generation. she can make me cry so easily. I really loved this, there were slow and confusing parts if we want to be detailed, but after reading the ending again...wow I have chills. I am so excited to see what she has planned after a decade!If you did not enjoy your first time reading, I HIGHLY recommend giving it a reread right after the first instalment.-------------------------------3/5- February 2022Honestly, I waited for this book for so long and am slightly conflicted with how I feel about this story as a whole. I have never rated a SJM novel this low before. I was sometimes forcing myself to read it - like it was some university homework . But I also liked how she took this series to an entire new level- I can tell there was a lot of research done.Pros:1. Ruhn and his love story. That storyline between day and night was the most surprising and delightful thing out of this book. The way these two have a hold on me right now. That ending elevator scene was one of the best in the book!! I was here for it!!!2. The secondary characters and the otters awwwww3. THE ENDING- what else can I say about that!!Cons:1. The plot was just not there for me. I could not feel any major stakes for the characters throughout. They were all fighting a fight that they all barely seemed to even want to be apart of. The majority of the novel was just everyone talking all the time and info dumping loads and loads of things. I genuinely got a headache reading it- like my head still hurts. And also not to mention, the amount of new characters being added. Everyone is so powerful, everyone has this power and blah blah blah- like no one felt special at all because there was every kind of type of being. It’s like SJM took every mythical creature to exist and dump them in 800 pages.2. The POVS were too much. Honestly I love a good multiple POV novel but this was just over doing it. Tell me why there was POV switches mid chapter- and sometimes even three switches. It was honestly too much and the characters really all started to blend into each-other sadly. No one stood out to me, even Bryce. I also was noticing the lack of female POVS. At some points it was all just Bryce in the room of men. Once I caught on, I couldn’t stop pointing it out. This novel felt very male centred and I was so over it by the end.3. The main romance was unnatural and boring . I’m sorry but this book made Bryce and Hunt so boring. For a novel that promises lots of heat and tension…. It was barely there honestly. It was at no point a ACOMAF type of romance for me (but nothing will ever be). I also got annoyed with how many times Bryce said alphahole and ashole like girl… we’re all over it. Almost everyone of her remarks back had to have some vulgar swearing in it. It was fun first but it gets tired very quickly.My final thoughts for this is that I truly think this novel by itself, was a complete filler for the next one. SJM honestly did not need to write 800 pages of this boring confusing stuff. She could have just given us 200 pages and that last chapter TBH. I see what she did and it was in a way very smart because THE LAST CHAPTER HAD ME SHAKING OKAY!I have hope in the next one because there is an amazing foundation to work with. But for me, I will likely not pick up House of Sky and Breath again.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'I had to take some time to really think about this book and what my feelings towards it are. And ultimately I’ve decided that I think I hate it lol.I loved the first book in this series. It was…kind of trashy reading, you know? But it was FUN and easy to fly through and the world of Crescent City was so vibrant and full of life that I couldn’t get enough.This one even though it was easy to read, and I finished it up pretty quickly, nothing about it really captured me like the first one. So much time was just spent in Bryce’s apartment I felt like, when before we’d been wandering the streets and things like that!Then there’s the added POVs. Tharion’s was so repetitive and most of his scenes could have EASILY been cut with zero consequence to anything, both in terms of his character and the plot. Ithan’s POV also could have been chopped in a lot of parts.A ton of sideplots seemed to be introduced in this one too, but they felt disconnected from the main story and felt like Sarah was just throwing stuff in to throw stuff in. They took time away from sideplots that had been set up in the previous book and were not explored in nearly enough depth here.There are plenty of reveals in this book that I think are meant to be surprising but they all just fall flat. Some are quite obvious. Others are not, simply because they come out of left field and seem very random.The romance was…fine. Until it wasn’t. Until the stupid concept of “mates” reared its ugly head. I’m so over it and it’s just tiring. Really seems like SJM just HAS to make sure we as readers know the characters are meant to be together because of this ridiculous fate thing. You shouldn’t have to rely on this to show that a couple is meant to be together, FYI. It’s not interesting, it’s been done to death (across MULTIPLE SERIES!!)The characters were mostly good still. But…it was very male-centred for most of the book. I would’ve liked to see Bryce interacting with Fury and Juniper more. And at some points, the men’s personalities all just kind of blended together.I think Sarah is stepping up her diversity game (about time lol), because I was happy to see more queer characters and more characters of colour added to the cast, and were present for good chunks of the book.That being said…the writing in this is very constricted to the gender binary. Things are described as “feminine” and “masculine” and everything is just all watered down to male and female and blah blah blah. This isn’t new for SJM, but I would just hope that after how many books this issue would at least start being resolved.The ending. The ENDING. The whole reason I needed to really take time to think about everything in this book. Because what a disaster. I’m gonna go into spoilers for the ending for the next two paragraphs so skip if you don’t want that!!Last spoiler warning….ok. So Bryce jumps into a portal to take her to another world to prevent herself from being used as the Asteri wish, and to hopefully gain allies from the armies of Hel. BUT she doesn’t end up in Hel, instead landing…in the ACOTAR world. Right outside Rhysand’s palace. And the book ends with Rhysand introducing himself to her.I genuinely don’t get how this was published, because this has to be one of the stupidest things I have ever read in my life and I mean that. So, what, now the ACOTAR characters are gonna be in the third one, presumably as somewhat important characters? Let them GO. They have their own series (that has also gone to shit) and don’t need to be in this one. It feels so lazy and ridiculous.End of spoilers!I’m quite disappointed with this one. House of Earth and Blood was genuinely almost my favourite book of 2020, and this is a mess in so many ways, plot-wise, romance-wise, etc.I can’t imagine I’ll be tuning in for book 3. And this might also be the last I read of Sarah J Maas.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '“Our love is stronger than time, greater than any distance. Our love spans across stars and worlds.

It was great, but not as good as the first one._______________________Second read:I am still flabergasted by that ending._______________________“You\'re a power player now, Bryce, whether you like it or not.”This book takes place a few months after the end of House of Earth and Blood. Bryce is trying to adapt to her new reality as the Princess of Fae, while also trying to work things out with Hunt to build a healthy and serious relationship. Hunt is enjoying his newfound freedom and Ruhn is building back the trust between his sister and him. Everything is fine and rather normal until they get sucked into a rescue mission involving some rebels and ruthless faes that will not hesitate to destroy them all should their affiliation with rebels be revealed.""You\'d almost think this was planned by the gods. They probably have a special task force: How to Fuck Over Bryce and Hunt in One Day.""The plot is good, but I didn’t find it as good as in the first book. It is full of unexpected twists and shocking revelations though, and the pace is engaging. My heart was pounding and I had to refrain from skimming parts of the book because I was so anxious to know what would happen, but at the same time, I wanted to take my time and savor this book... Conflicted emotions and a few heart attacks apart though, it is a great book and many details from the first book have a big significance in this book, and I like that there was a deeper connection between the books than simply having the same set of characters embarking on a new adventure.""Our insurance rates will go sky-high,"" Ruhn said to Declan, appealing to the slightly-less-insane of his roommates.""When the fuck did you become a grown-up?"" Flynn barked.Ithan jerked his own chin toward the doorway again. ""Wait to have your meltdown until after you meet the fourth new roommate.""“I’m sorry,” Ithan said, scrubbing at his face, “but what the fuck is this about?” He glanced at the pizza on the table, as if wondering whether it had been spiked with something.Welcome to our lives, Hunt wanted to say.""You\'re part of the Quinlan-Silago clan now. We\'re a crazy bunch, but we love each other.""ILOVEthe characters in this book,THEY ARE SO CUTE AND PERFECT TOGETHER. SJM worked her magic once again and made me fall in love with them as I did fall in love with the crew of ACOTAR and TOG. The secondary characters are as lovable and amazing as the main characters. The friendship developing between the guys in this book is so cute and wholesome! Ruhn, Flynn, Declan, Tharion, Hunt, and even Ithan are becoming a cute little boy\'s club and my heart is SO happy about that. I said in my review of the first book that I wanted more of Ithan and Tharion, and I got it! Hypaxia is also more present in this book and I can already see that Bryce and her will make a kickass duo.Okay, now this might be an unpopular opinion, but in light of what we learned in this book, I was not impressed with Danika’s choices and behavior toward Bryce, and the friendship I admired so much in the first book turned a little sour. I feel that Bryce gave her everything to Danika, and Danika only gave her a few pieces. I know Danika loved Bryce fiercely, but she kept so many huge secrets from Bryce, and every time Bruce discovers a new truth about Danika, it only upsets her because she sees how little she truly knew about her best friend…She said to Flynn, “Hey, remember that time you set a dragon free and were dumb enough to think she’d follow your orders?”“Hey, remember that time you wanted to marry me and wrote Lady Bryce Flynn in all your notebooks?”Hunt choked.Bryce countered with, “Hey, remember when you pestered me for years to hook up with you, but I have something called standards—”“This is highly unusual behavior for royals,” Hypaxia observed.The found family is one of my favorite tropes, and I loved every mundane moment with the gang in this book because of this feeling of finally having somewhere to belong. From Hunt making new friends to Ithan and Rhun mending their relationship with Bryce, it was cute, sweet, and so satisfying to see them all finally feel like they belonged somewhere and had people who cared about them.She sipped from her champagne, then said casually to Hunt, ""The headline on the gossip sites tomorrow is going to be: Horndog Umbra Mortis gropes Starborn Princess at Ballet.""""Good,"" Hunt murmured. ""It\'ll improve my standing in the 33rd.""""You know what I mean,"" Bryce said.""I\'m not sure I do."" Had his voice dropped lower?""We\'re roomies,"" she said, her own voice getting breathy.""Roomies.""""Occasional Beer Pong Champion?""Hunt snatched the hat off her head and plunked it back on his own, backward as usual, ""Yes, the Autumn King truly fears our unholy beer pong alliance.""The romance between Bryce and Hunt is still super cute, and we also have more spicy moments, even though SJM did ensure that Hunt got cockblocked quite a few times before *it* finally happened. They are cute and funny and they still have that witty banter from the first book that I enjoyed so much. I like that the author managed to keep the sexual tension between them for so long and that when they finally did the deed, they didn’t turn into sex-obsessed fae/angel and did nothing else for the rest of the book. They enjoyed each other but kept in mind that they had more important things to do and that there were lives on the line.“Hel’s armies shall strike at your command, Bryce Quinlan.”I am a little disappointed though that Aidas was not more present in this book. I really like him, and I think he has the potential to be a truly complex and interesting morally grey character, but we haven\'t seen enough of him to really know what he is up to and where he stands in the conflict that is to come.I can\'t wait for the next book. There is SO MUCH potential for an even more epic third book, but at the same time, I am SO FREAKING SCARED of what could happen to my babies. 😭😭😭😭😭Hunt’s voice was a thunderclap as he said behind her, “Light it up, Bryce.”1.House of Earth and Blood⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Follow me on Instagram🙂'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '#1House of Earth and Blood— 3.5 starsWHAT IN THE NAME OFCROSSOVER INSANITYSATANS TIT IS THIS😩✷ to Hel with me banking on this book to be better than the previous installment cause this was a downgrade. i was bored through most of it, and finishing it had felt like a chore.✷ although... i feel like this wasdullin a way that the next book would get good and exciting again since the stakes are higher now. but who knows, we’ll probably have to wait another two years to find out. should i quit while im ahead?✷(spoiler)i had guessed thatDaywas Lidia, but that last chapter i really did not see coming. when i said “i needed SJM to pull a Rhysand,” i didnt mean LITERALLY. 💀 does that mean Bryce is in Velaris now?✷ we’ve managed to go without any “mates” business in book 1, but now so many of them (couple/pairing plot twists) were dropped like bombs in this book. the romance was done very poorly. how did SJM go from Aelin/Rowan, Elide/Lorcan, and Feyre/Rhys tothiscrap?✷(spoiler)Ruhn & Lidia, i didnt hate the idea of them, but wow the instalove had me wanting to barf. 🙄 though now that they know each others true identity, maybe there’ll be more tension between them in book 3.✷ Bryce & Hunt seriously? am i the only one who couldnt feel the connection/passion between them? theyre better off as friends. also, the smut. from none (book 1) to... how many scenes in this book? idk what to say. and they werent thattitillatingeither.✷ im so disappointed Aidas didnt even make an appearance in this book. he was mentioned and impersonated, but no signs of the Prince of the Chasm. :( would it be foolish to hold out hope for him & Bryce? especially after what happened with Bryce & Hunt.✷ idk if its me no longer being a teenager who adored SJMs books, but so far im finding this series is even worse than TOG & ACOTAR. especially, the writing and the romance.(read as an audiobook)'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '""We waste so much time. Maybe it\'s our curse as immortals. To see time as a luxury, a never-ending ocean.""I loved every moment of this book. I loved every word. I loved every twist, and every turn, and everything in between.Sarah J. Maas - thank you so much for making reading so much fun. Every time. Always. I don\'t know who I would be without Feyre, Ness, and Bryce. I don\'t want to know because I love who I am with all of their journeys pushing me forward.This book in particular feels like a big hug. Is it just like every SJM book that takes us on a wild journey of emotion? Yes. But it also feels just a bit different to me. It feels like I\'m walking next to Bryce the entire time, hanging out with her and her friends. It feels like I\'m at Ruhn\'s house, like I\'m playing video games with Baxian and Hunt. Or watching Sunball with Ithan and Tharion. It feels like I\'m laughing as Ithan falls through the coffee table and talking to Bryce and Juniper about dance classes.I\'ve loved books for a long time, but I don\'t think I\'ve ever felt so a part of something before.House of Sky and Breath is all about the chaos that comes from a battle won, wondering when the next thing is going to fall on your shoulders. It\'s about choosing to stand up for those who can\'t stand up for themselves, even when you finally have the life you\'ve always wanted. It\'s dreaming for a future while wondering if there is one out there for you at all.It\'s loving your friends. Remembering to live no matter what is happening around you. Choosing who you want to be and not accepting the life that was chosen for you. Bryce constantly shows us what it means to truly carve your own way in the world, and I will never stop looking up to her. Wanting to be just like her.The quote I pointed out, doesn\'t it just come to embody this series as a whole? We don\'t know how much time we have with the people we love, so why not make the most of every single moment we do have?And the plot reflects that entirely.I will never get tired of reading House of Earth and Blood because I have never read something that more perfectly reflects my own experience with grief and heartache. This book? I\'ll always feel like I found a group of people who will always make me feel included and a part of something.One thing that fiction will always have over reality is that it can make time stop. We only get what an author chooses to share with us, and no more. A plot will never change, and the people will always be who they were at the last word on a page. It\'s one of the most comforting feelings in the world that no matter what happens, characters will always be who they were the first time we read them.They change, the adapt, they live, they die... but they never leave you. People drift. It\'s human nature to move on, change and grow. But our favorite characters are always right there on a bad day. A good one. A weird one. A sad one.I will walk every world with Bryce, and I\'ll do so for the rest of my life.I can\'t wait for book three.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Okay, this was cool and all, but not as good as I expected it to be.

Also, imagine having pussy so good you can calm down a crazed, psychotic angel with the power of it. Woof.Tharion: Mommy issuesRuhn: Daddy issues and sex. Plus the most obvious plot twist I think Maas has ever written.Ithan: Another “male” swept away by Bryce’s charm, acting like a love sick puppy half the time. It doesn’t matter how many times you tell me he’s acting like a alpha/sunbowl player, I’ve gotta see it to believe it.Every character in this book is shallow, under-developed and mostly unnecessary. They all tend to blur into one anyway. Almost all of them are massive flirts who get irritable, and that’s about it.Don’t even get me STARTED on the ending. Rhysand rearing his ugly fucking head again because apparently SJM and her fans are just involved in the biggest, cringe inducing circle-jerk I’ve ever had the misfortune of witnessing. The level of self obsession with your own creation is mind boggling. Maas really watched Phase 4 of Marvel and went “yes, that please.” Seriously, the fact that she is an award winning author and has such a devoted, insane fan base is beyond me. She does not deserve the hype she has and I weep for the indie authors who have more skill in their pinkie finger.Also, foot fetish.EDIT: I also feel like adding to this, because I’ve seen so many people defending her, but Danika was a bitch. She hid so much from Bryce, and people are arguing it was for her own safety? She literally tattooed a target in her best friends back. LITERALLY. She dragged her into it, and did nothing to inform or protect her. She’s a shitty friend. I thought it was obvious, but the amount of people I’ve seen defending her is driving me nuts. It always leaves me confused - how does SJM write such awful characters that people will swear up and down are lovely and brilliant and kind, when they’re the exact opposite? She writes most of her love interests as toxic arseholes and people still idolise them. Is it her at fault, or her fan base? Honestly at this point I have no idea. It’s not even like she writes GREY characters - there is absolutely no justification for what Danika has done to Bryce. None. She put her in danger and withheld so much information that could have saved them so much time and danger. She hid she had a mate. She literally tattoos a weapon onto her without consent, putting her in mortal danger. Why? She’s an awful friend. Point blank.

It only seems fair that way)Full review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolf🐺If I am the only weirdo that reads the dedication at the beginning of a book and rates it too in her own head then okay, fine, weirdo I’ll be, but I have to start this review by saying this.Sarah J. Maas dedicated this book to her parents. It is one of the most beautiful dedications I’ve ever read at the beginning of a book.It says:“For my parents – who taught me to believe that girls can save the world.”How beautiful and inspirational and worth of all of our respect is this?Once upon a time, not too long ago, my life ended brutally. The cause of my abrupt death was simple:Throne of Glassseries has ended; the final blow –Kingdom of Ash.Barely 5 chapters in and I was already crying. In that moment I realised that I had a storm of tears ahead of me and there was no way in hell I might elude it. It felt like I was about to be hit by it. And hard. AND GUESS WHAT. I was.This book was everything to me.I have never in my life declared that I might have a favourite book, simply because I haven’t found the one yet and I thought it won’t be fair for the rest of the great books out there. Now I am going to make a statement I’ve never made in my life: until further information, Kingdom of Ash by Sarah J. Maas is my favourite book ever.I cannot understand how, but this book just crept deep, into the core of my soul, ripped it apart, ruined my sense of life and left me aching both of devastating pain and of speechless joy. It felt complete and at ease with the Universe and I am grateful that there is a book that can destroy me but still find a way to mend me.Not even the best review I could ever come up with can cover all the awesomeness of this book. But I'll try. As good as I can. But keep in mind: everything I state here is not even half as good as the book itself. It’s like trying to explain colour to someone who’s never seen the light of the day. Hopeful, but utterly impossible.“(…) to have the power of eternity in the palm of your hand.”There was a line from this Romanian book I once read that says:the time run out of patience.When there might seem like there is an infinite amount of time that no one can take away from you, keep in mind that maybe the time itself decides when it might want to leave.In Kingdom of Ash, the time felt like its own god and indeed, it felt like it run out of patience.Everything felt desperate, hopeless. Nothing went according to any plan. There were no gods above, no demons below. There was nothing. And the characters and the action itself seemed to feel that too – the anarchy. They were rushed but reduced to silent fight. They were pressed and oppressed. They ran out of hope but still kept looking for it. It was devastating. Throughout and beyond.Theworld-buildingwas still absolutely fabulous. Plus, the insides of an actual, super scary, dark war were a super addition.“Let’s make this fight worthy of a song.”In this book, the characters are the ones who make the action. They were the most important tool in the destruction of me. So, I don’t even have the faintest idea what to tell you about them.I can give my heart, soul, both kidneys, half a lung and one eye to protect them all.They are precious babies.Myprecious babies.I fell in love with all of those fantastic characters. Like truly in love. They made me ache all over and they made me feel part of their lives. I laughed and cried with them, I fought and won. I suffered and I loved. That is the most precious thing a book can soothe you with. To make you feel included. Hollow and whole.I wish I could say more about all this. I really do. But I can’t. It doesn’t feel complete. By this book, I am forever undone.“Once upon a time, in a land long since burned to ash, there lived a young princess who loved her kingdom.”""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Here is my updated shelf!Here's my big boxed set with poster.

Everything hurts but I’m so happy right now.——————————————I mean, I’d be happy to swear a blood-oath to Sarah J Maas.So many thoughts were running through my mind whilst I was reading this, but now that I have reached the ending of this book, I’m just a mess of tears and emotions and I don't know how to express how much it all means to me.I think I can safely say that this is my favourite book of all time. It was transcending.Sarah J Maas is a Dreamer, and I don’t think any book has fulfilled my dreamer’s heart as much as this book. It satisfied me to no end.All my hopes and dreams were placed in these characters and their world and for the cause they fought for. It hit me deep and it has carved itself into me and gratitude alone does not cover the feeling I have in my heart right now.You write and read stories and dream up better worlds, so you can find some hope in time’s of bleakness, to get by, to will yourself to live another day, and look towards a future that is better than what you’ve experienced and are living. Hope emanated throughout my course of reading these books and what I was left with.All of their lives intertwined so beautifully, kindness being repaid with infinite kindness and I was being taught over and over again that goodness outshines and outlives everything.And then the acknowledgements happened...

And if I never hear a woman’s vagina described as her “heated silk” again, that will be just fine by me!Honestly, though, I have to give it to her: Maas showed a lot of restraint in this book. It was a good 350 pages before Rowan’s magical penis made an appearance 😬. Sorry, I just can't resist. Overall, I liked it enough to give it three stars. I mean, I read all of the bajillion pages, which is saying something.It's been a long ride. Emphasis on the long. I'm still perplexed as to why these books got so long in the end.Kingdom of Ashhas some really strong moments, but there's so much filler and repetition that you have to fight through the boring parts to get to them. This is, at most, a 500-page story, extended with long, slow stretches of the characters journeying from one place to another, and repetitive scenes of battle. Also:Chaol and Yrene are so dull.The first 100 pages and last 150 pages were the most gripping, for me. The conclusion is suitably dramaticthough I'm amazed that everyone managed to surviveand the beginning details the horrific torture Aelin suffers at the hands of Cairn-- it's not a book for the squeamish. The disgusting scenes of torture also become a little repetitive after a while, but it starts very tense. How will Aelin get out of this?? The answer is really quite satisfying, too.I do feel like this is a very long epilogue. There's battle scene after battle scene but not much of a plot. Dorian has an interesting part to play in this with his newfound abilities, which is one of the stronger aspectsexcept the bit where he turns into a girl and, um,exploreshis new body *shudders*, butvery little happens for an almost 1000-page novel. It's mostly about wrapping things up, tying up any loose ends and neatly establishing Aelin's awesomeness. The way each of the main characters has to be perfectly settled into a het pairing is a little forced, too, but oh well.Well, I'm glad I read it to the end, and I do feel a little sad that it's over. I've been reading these books for more than five years and I can't believe how much my own life has changed since I started.

Bittersweet.I cried and sobbed, I gasped, I screamed, I smiled, I felt my heart beating out of my chest, I shivered, I swooned. I don't think I'll ever be able to write a proper review, but I still feel the need to highlight some elements that marked me (slightly spoilerish gibberish ahead).Fenrys & Aelin's silent language. Aelin not knowing what's real and what's not. Aedion hurting and being an ass because of it. Lysandra battling without stopping. Elide sprinting towards death for love. Ansel's soldiers. Aelin's scars. Rowan's vision. Dorian's lack of self-worth and perpetual need to sacrifice. Aelin crying when seeing her second love walk. Aelin realising little gifts pay off greatly. Aelin grinning and swaggering. Chaol running towards his King. Dorian thinking about Sorscha. Manon and the three Matrons. A Queen of Witches with a crown of stars. Aedion thinking about dying like his childhood heroes. Abraxos. The Little Folk. Petrah Blueblood. Gavin. Kaltain. Manon stopping herself from thinking about Dorian. The Thirteen, the Thirteen, the Thirteen. A tribute to the fallen. Dorian adoring his best friend's wife. Dorian as an uncle. The gods. Nameless is my price. Elena's soul. Mala's gift. The fall through worlds and the help received along the journey. A lion and his cub, together. Yrene Towers being amazing every step of the way. A queen defending the walls. Evangeline melting an old man's heart. Cousins finding one another, two faces of the same coin. A letter from a mother. The original trio and their incredible love for one another. A broken curse. Brothers by choice. Saying hello from time to time. A prince becoming a lord. A warrior becoming a lord. A field of blooming flowers. Looking forward to tomorrow. A better world.No, I'm not crying, you're crying. All these things above broke me in different ways, ripped me apart, some mending my heart back together. I am so in love with this story, so grateful for this fictional world and these characters, that I cannot quite believe it is over. It should be illegal to attach so deeply to imaginary beings, because it goddamn hurts when reality seeps in and they're no longer around you.

Seven books, each getting longer, complex, but most importantly, better than the last, every time. Now, Maas has given a near perfect conclusion to this lengthy series with Kingdom of Ash.""It\'s too late for speeches.""By now, there is little new to tell about writing style, character development, and the flow of story. Each of these things are considerably improved to where we started with the first book. The author has come a long way, and done a remarkable job with this last installment to give the series a thorough ending. Given how complex the plot is, and the number of loose ends by the end of last two books, I\'m surprised how well she brought everything together, handling each thread perfectly.""Let\'s make this a fight worthy of a song.""As the events in fifth and sixth books took place in the same (parallel) timeframe, first third of Kingdom of Ash deals with bringing the dispersed characters to two main plot-lines. What follows is absolute chaos, each group fighting their own battles, until we reach the concluding war. Even with a number of defeats, I liked Aedion\'s side of the battles more, which seemed more dramatic and emotional at the same time.""We are the Thirteen from now until the Darkness claims us.""""What was stolen has been restored; what was lost has come home again. I hail thee, Manon Crochan, Queen of Witches.""All my favorite characters in this series came from third book onwards, starting with Manon (and the Thirteen), then Rowan, Elide, Nesryn until we met rest of the cadre, Yrene, Borte and many others. But from the original trio, I only came to admire Dorian, and not Aelin and Chaol. It was touch and go for a while, but I\'m glad the direction Dorian was assigned at last, allowing him to redeem himself. I didn\'t hate Chaol by any means but lost interest somewhere along the way, so he didn\'t made it to my favorites. As for Aelin, even though her character had gotten somewhat better in time, she still had a number of inconsistencies in my opinion. But the other characters held the story together for me... until now. I knew the author would have to get rid of some good guys eventually when the wars took place, but I guess I wasn\'t ready for the losses. They were heartbreaking, and it has been one emotional roller-coaster ride with this last book. I certainly understand the necessity to kill some characters to make things seem more real, but it\'s never easy. Still, I cannot help but commend the way Maas handled everything towards the end, even doing justice to those who were lost.""Don\'t burden yourself with the what-ifs.""Kingdom of Ash gave one of the most complete endings I\'ve come across in a while. The author did not leave a singe loose end, and brought everything together perfectly, and very patiently. I guess it shows how much Maas cares for this series.""A loyal friend is a rare thing indeed.""I\'m not going to say it has been a smooth ride with Throne of Glass. Especially not with the underwhelming first book, and a below average second. But Maas recovered quite well as the series progressed. The third and the fourth made revolutionary jumps in my opinion, where as rest maintained evolutionary improvements. Now that I\'ve finished the series, I feel like the seven books belongs to three sub-series, consisting of one trilogy, and two duologies: first two books as an introductory duology, third and fourth books along with the sixth as a build-up trilogy, and fifth book and the seventh to conclude everything. I know this entire series has been praised by many as a good romantic fantasy series, but I was never able to get in to that part here. I still don\'t understand why Maas decided to take things to adult (or new adult) by focusing on romance aspects a lot, but I guess it\'s just me. But in the end, I really enjoyed this series. Towards the second and third books, I was certain I would never re-read this but considering how good it was towards the end, I might just re-read this someday. Special thanks toMiche,BabaandDaniellefor convincing me not to give up from the outset.

Never. There were points were I had to stop reading because I couldn\'t see the page through my tears.This was a journey, and I don\'t just mean this book. This whole series has such a special place in my heart, and what I think a lot of people don\'t realise is that the Throne of Glass series, like the Harry Potter series, was designed to age with its readers. The teenagers who started reading this series at the release ofThrone of Glassare now adults, and this series was written for us: to grow with us into our adulthood, to walk with us from our frantic teens to the endless possibilities of our twenties, to change and adapt as our priorities in life naturally do.I started following this story, of Celaena in a glass castle, solving mysteries and fighting duels, when I was 19. Now, at 24, I\'ve turned the last page of Aelin\'s story, but it doesn\'t hurt to say goodbye. It feels full, like a beautiful finished painting, a tapestry with every thread neatly tucked away. If there was a better way to end this, I can\'t think of what that might be.This series has meant a lot to me, and while it has its flaws, it\'s one of those stories that I\'ll come back to again. Because the themes are timeless, of bravery and love and healing, of family and redemption and hope, hope, hope. All of the books, but this one in particular, is at its heart about the power of never giving up, and of standing up for what you believe in against impossible odds. The wins and the losses - terrible losses that made me openly sob - were sore but meaningful, and that\'s the greatest triumph of this excellent last chapter. That it all meant something, and that even the small ones, the most unlikely of heroes, the ones that no one saw coming, left their mark.I\'ve gained and lost a lot of possessions in my life, but my books are important to me. My books have travelled with me across seas, across continents, across great and sometimes painful frontiers in my life. This series is the reason why my books mean so much to me. Because they\'re transformative, evergreen, a truly powerful form of art.

I might have shaved off about 15 years of my life getting through 980 pages in about a week and a half so I could get the book back to the library, but I did it.But, my God, at what cost.I\'m not even sure where to start with this steaming pile of garbage. It was nearly 1,000 pages, and hardly anything of note really happened. It was filled with filler nonsense and ridiculous internal feuds that were not only pointless, but made absolutely no sense to even exist, especially with this world ending war on, just to fill pages. And anything of note thatdidhappen was so sloppily handled that I wanted to scream.So where will I start? With the basics I suppose. I shall show you what basically set the tone for the book for me, and how I knew that every single page would be searing agony to get through.The very first page opens with these two lines:He had been hunting for her since the moment she was taken from him.His mate.SJMaas could not make it two lines into this book without saying the word ""mate."" This is what I mean when I say it set the tone for the book, because if you have read this far in her books, you know what I mean when I say that this entire book isfilledwith her heavy handed, badly written garbage.So, let\'s delve into the thick of it. I\'m gonna try to be as organized as I can, but forgive me if things start to get a bit chaotic. It\'s hard to keep these raging feelings of absolutefuryat bay.POVs:I have to start with the very first, glaring sin this book committed. The one that stood out as I got a mere twelve chapters into the book: the exceedingly unnecessary amount of POVs.Guess how many there were, dear reader. Guess, before I type it out.Did you do it? Did you guess?Drum roll please.There were fifteen whole POVs in this book. No, I am not kidding. Fifteen. Eleven of which, I believe, had been utilized by chapter twelve.Still don\'t believe me? I\'m gonna give you each of them now.AedionElideAelinManonDorianLorcanRowanChaolNesrynYreneLysandraFenrysRandom unnamed soldier for like a page???third person omniscient POV at random points in the bookEvangelineYes, dear reader. This is what I suffered through. This outrageously ridiculous number of POVs, each one giving me Their Take on things going on, even if they are in the same vicinity as a character whose POV I just read. It was painful. So incredibly painful. The fact that Maas could not tell this story, could not express these characters\' emotions without inserting us into their heads, is a testament to just how mediocre of a writer she is.And therein lies another issue with this unconscionable amount of POVS:none of them were distinguishable without her telling us whose head we are in.They all blurred together. There were times we would swap POVs and I would assume we were in Dorian\'s head, when we were in fact in Manon\'s. Or I would think we were in Rowan\'s head, when were in fact in Lorcan\'s. These characters are all so similar, all so boringly bland and indistinct, that the dozen of POVs we are subjected to all just wind up meshing together until Maas clarifies whose head we are in. That is just... so sloppy. Solazythat I cannot even fathom how this book was allowed to be published and made to be this long.There was no reason for every single main character introduced throughout the books to be given a POV. Absolutely none. Especially if you aren\'t even going to take that extra, necessary step to ensure that your characters aren\'t all just a carbon copy of each other.Vocabulary:Someone, anyone, please get this woman a thesaurus. I ambeggingyou. If I never see the words mate, ancient, crone, decimated (Used incorrectly, I might add!!! Every single time!!!!), thrice (please, for the love of God, never say that word to me ever), snows (I still don\'t know why she pluralized it every single time), sang, and a whole slew of other words that I just could not be bothered to write down, it will be too soon.I don\'t know, but as an aspiring writer myself, I\'m always looking up words and their synonyms. Looking for different ways to describe things, different words to get my point across. Maas has apparently never heard of a thesaurus. I am certain of this, as the word ""thrice"" did not start appearing in her books untilTower of Dawnwhere she took every single opportunity to just sprinkle it throughout her prose. A trend which unfortunately extended intoKingdom of Ash. It was like someone told her this was a word that existed, and she completely forgot that you can say ""three times"" or just straight up not specify that it was done more than twice. For the love of god.But, anyway, enough of my ranting about that cursed word. Back to the matter at hand: any object or person more than fifty years old was ""ancient."" Every woman over 60 was a ""crone"" (an incredibly derogatory word for old women, its overuse continuing from where it began inTower of Dawn). I still don\'t know why snow was described as ""snows,"" as I have never seen that extra ""S"" added to the end of the word before now. Everything was ""decimated,"" despite its actual meaning pertaining to ""kill one out of ten of a group of soldiers as punishment"" thereby not really causing a lot of destruction.Oh, and everything ""sang"" to these characters. Their blood, the wind, their weapons, their magic. You name it, it sang to them.Please, Maas, for the love of god, just keep google open as you write and type in ""[word] synonym."" It\'ll be enlightening. I swear it.Listen, I know all writers have words and phrases they fall back on in their styles, Lord knows I am one of them, but that\'s what editors are for! To point these things out to the writer so they can be fixed!!! Where are her editors!!!!! Where are they!!!Character Mutilation:I don\'t mean this in the sense of extreme violence. Well, not in the literal, physical sense, at least. I mean that none of these characters are who they started out as—and not in the good ""character development"" way.For example, Manon. The badass, remorseless wingleader of a coven of bloody-thirsty witches. Evil, maybe even swinging toward morally gray, she was one of the most interesting characters. With teeth of iron and nails to match, she bowed to no one except her grandmother, and ruled over her Thirteen with an iron fist, letting everyone know who was in charge.Well, sinceEmpire of Stormsshe\'s been thoroughly declawed. She\'s just like everyone single one of these boring as hell characters. Completely good, despite a lifetime of being taught to hate and kill. Conditioning like that cannot be cured in a few short months, Maas. No matter the revelations.And please do not get me started on how she wound up basically begging Dorian to not go to Morath alone. On her knees before him, offering him marriage if it meant him staying.Manon Blackbeak of the Ironteeth, cowed before a man, offering to shackle herself to him.Maas truly is the queen of ruining her own characters. It would be impressive if it wasn\'t an affront to the written word that her series are so damned popular.Dorian, too, is a shell of his former self. I don\'t know how to tell Maas this, but suffering from a traumatic experience doesn\'t suddenly make you a cold, boring bastard who\'s into BDSM. It was a weird shift that was literally just so that she could write yet another male character who falls into the only mold that she knows how to write.And there is also Lorcan, who was the one Fae character I liked. He was turned into a carbon copy of Rowan. The reason I had liked him was because he was a bastard! A bastard that maybe felt something for the human in his care! And there is nothing I love more than an immortal who hates everything, falling for one mortal and damning everything else in their path.But, nah, he\'s totally good now, too. Don\'t worry about it.I could go through each character and point out the various ways that Maas completely destroyed everything that made them interesting (here\'s lookin\' at you, Chaol Westfall, my former favorite character in this series), but I won\'t, because I do have a character limit that is dwindling fast. So let\'s move on.Specific Grievances:I suppose I can attempt to tackle this now.I\'m gonna be real, I didn\'t start diligently taking notes until I was about halfway through the book, maybe slightly less, so the first half is a bit of a muddled blur.So I\'m just gonna dive right into everything that ground against my very soul. I\'m gonna be bouncing around a lot, and will likely not even touch on everything, but I\'m gonna try. My God, I\'m gonna try.First and foremost: OP Dorian\'s magic being able to take literally whatever form he wishes—including shapeshifting. (He is able to keep his clothes on because he is just So Good at it, unlike Lysandra, a born shifter, who is naked every time she shifts back into her human form. Is it bad writing or sexism? Who knows!)After a few days of practicing, Dorian is basically a master shifter. That\'s not even the real problem I have! The problem I have is what Maas decided to do with it.In order to practice this, Dorian turned himself into a woman, a Crochan witch to be exact as he and Manon are living amongst them. So I had to read Maas describe Dorian describe what it was like to be in a woman\'s body. What the boobs felt like, how he had to learn how to walk like a woman (women walk a certain way??? We walk, Maas. We walk like every other human being. You are a woman. You should know this.), and then he used his ~invisible hands~ to caress Manon while in that form after she found him out.It was an insult, honestly. That entire scene was an absolute travesty that amounted to nothing in the end other than showing how great Dorian is. I want to have a word with Maas over that scene alone.Going off of that basic idea of Dorian being all powerful, for the love of God is Maas able to write one (1) ordinary person? Every single character in this book is touched by a god, blessed with power of catastrophic levels, fated to be something great, or the descendent of some long forgotten dead royal line.Manon is the last Crochan queen, Elide had some god who I cannot even remember who they are looming over her shoulders, Yrene is blessed by the god of healing and is the Best Healer Ever, Chaol is tethered to that greatest healer ever, Dorian is OP as all hell, Rowan and every single Fae is powerful and perfect, Nesryn has become a ruk rider who is going to become empress, Lorcan had the god of death following him, Lysandra is a shifter, Aedion is part fae and the best soldier ever.And then there is perfect Aelin. I\'m sure I don\'t have to go through her merits. God, she makes me sick she is soridiculouslyoverpowered, even after Maas attempts to nerf her.Throughout my entire journey reading this book, Syndrome from the movieThe Incrediblesrang in my head:""When everyone\'s super, no one will be.""Which is basically what this book came down to. Everyone was important! Everyone had some sort of fate/destiny thing going on with them! Not one person was ordinary!! Do you know how boring that makes a plot? Even with the cartoonishly evil Erawan and Maeve with their stupidly big army, nothing felt like a threat to these people! Someone always came along to help them, because they had so many Super Friends. I was never once afraid for any main character\'s life. A shame about all of those faceless grunts, though. They never stood a chance in this plot.I\'ve been saying this for awhile now, but I\'ll say it again, Maas needs to learn how to keep her stakes small. She escalates the stakes in her books to these laughable heights, that there\'s no fear of loss or failure anymore. I didn\'t fear the villain who barely had any page time. I didn\'t fear Maeve, whose real identity reveal was little more than one of Maas\' infamous retcons so she could pat herself on the back for being such a genius writer. I didn\'t fear Morath\'s army or the witches. Nothing made me care about the fate of any of these characters, because I knew they would all be fine, I knew they would beat Erawan and Maeve.I always said that the big bad should have been Arobynn. He was infinitely more interesting than any other bad guy she threw our way. And guess why:Because the stakes with him were small, personal. He was a very real source of agony in Aelin\'s life. Before the retconning that happened inEmpire of Storms,it was no fated meeting. He was just an arrogant, self serving man who used an orphaned girl to his advantage and molded her into a weapon for his use. Defeating him, taking down the Assassin\'s Guild, would have been a much more interesting plot.But she basically turned him and the Assassin\'s Guild into a foot note, choosing instead to have this stupid, apocalyptic plot instead. Sacrificing emotion and feeling for blockbuster proportions of writing.And yet this book has a 4.71 rating on here right now. A fact that actually hurts the depths of my soul.Anyway, speaking of SJMess retconning, she\'s at it again, folks! And you\'ll never guess how.So, she never named the King of Adarlan. Could never be bothered to. That\'s just classic SJMess, not naming her villains (shoutout to theA Court of Thorns and Rosesseries with yet another cartoonish villain whose name is still not clear). But guess what! That\'s actually Erawan\'s fault! He wiped the King of Adarlan\'s name from his memory, fromhistoryto ensure he was completely in his thrall. So, never fear, readers! Maas has an answer for everything! Even her pisspoor writing and world building.Oh, and it\'s later revealed that the king\'s name was Dorian. That he remembered his name for but a moment, when he first held Dorian in his arms, and bestowed his name upon him. Because Maas issolazy that she couldn\'t even come up with a different name for the man. Jesus Christ.I really need to address Maas\' idea of military strategy next, because as someone who has read countless books, both fiction and nonfiction, about war and battles and actual military maneuvers, this book ground against every single nerve in my body.For whatever reason, Maas thinks battles happen for hours straight at a time, ending at sundown on the dot, and not picking up again until sunrise.First and foremost, [John Mulaney voice]no.Night is the best time for fighting! That is strategically the best time to launch a counter-offensive! Your enemy is tired, any sentries they have dozing, and the bulk of their forces are exhausted beyond measure. That is theperfecttime for your ground forces to sneak in and launch a surprise attack! Doubly so if your army is made up of demons who supposedly dwelled in the darkness in their home world!And so much of war and battle iswaiting.Waiting for the enemy to strike. Waiting for your superiors to make a decision. Waiting for who will make the next move. The fact that Maas\' war was so structured, that Morath\'s armies were so polite to give their opponents clockwork attack patterns, is infuriating. The way this war was fought, the counter-force should have won despite the numbers against them. Attack at night, you absolute idiots!!!!!!!!And then there were the specific military maneuvers!!! Okay, so, you may remember these ""witch towers"" that produced an attack power of Biblical proportions. Or perhaps not. I sure didn\'t. There is too much going on in these books. Anyway, there were witch towers pitted against Orynth. They started out well against them once they realized they were in play, and dug a trap to take them out, and successfully destroyed three out of four of them. Good job, guys! Proper counter-offensive!But, they only disabled one of them. That\'s fine. You can deal with that later after you push back the army. Except they didn\'t. They completely forgot about it. Even after Manon and her Crochans showed up and the Morath army wasso shockedthat they pulled back for the night, they didn\'t plan to take out the tower!! They completely forgot about it until it took out a whole chunk of their aerial legion!!!Proper military strategy would have had the aerial troops scrambling to take out the witch tower first. They would have had squads running defense, drawing fire, and entering dog fights while a main squad went for the witch tower to take it out. They supposedly spent an entire night strategizing, and no one thought to bring up the veritable nuclear bomb on the field? The fact that everyone just Forgot about the temporarily disabled witch tower and now it\'s not only functional, but prepped and ready to blow apart their army and city just shows how little SJMess even looked into actual warfare. Or maybe her characters are just this stupid. I don\'t know anymore, but I\'m tired of knowing more than this best selling author. All I know is she needed a Dramatic way to give Manon more angst by making the Thirteen sacrifice themselves to bring down the tower. Because she\'s like the Joss Whedon of books.Okay, I\'m running out of room so I\'m gonna aim at the last two things that made me want to blow my brains out:1) Out of the main characters, no one died. The only semi-main character death count were Gavriel and the Thirteen, both of whichchoseto die to help the army. No one\'s death was out of their control. No one just had a bad case of wrong place at the wrong time. What kind of war is this? What the actual hell, Maas? Do you know how many people die in war despite the fact that they were highly trained and skilled specialists? I cannot stand this woman and her writing.2) She couldn\'t help herself. She just couldn\'t do it. She just had to put Rhysand and Feyre in this book. Sure, it was barely half a page of a cameo, but she just couldn\'t help herself. She just couldn\'t resist the opportunity to jack off directly in my face. If I hadn\'t already been over halfway through the book, I would have stopped reading right there. It was the most nauseating thing I had ever seen, and if I ever have the chance, I willabsolutelysay that directly to her face.I didn\'t even scratch the surface with this review. I have an entire google doc filled with every single thing that pissed me off, and it\'s at least three pages long. It\'s apparently bad to suppress a magic wielder\'s magic, as Aelin found out after two months of it, and yet the entire country of Adarlan suppressed magic for adecadeand absolutely no magic wielders had any ill effects. Aelin\'s magic was drained to the dregs to forge the Lock, and yet she was able to fight Erawan and Maeve with her ""limited"" power the entire time and never once actually ran out. I can keep going! I could go on and on! But goodreads has decided that this is enough, as I am down to just a few hundred characters.Bottom line: This series was garbage. I started out liking this series and Maas\' writing, but as I\'ve discovered, Maas\' talent doesn\'t lie in writing, but in brutally mutilating her own creations until they are unrecognizable husks of what had once made them even the slightest bit interesting.I am grateful to be done with this series. I\'m grateful to be rid of SJMaas.And no, I don\'t recommend these books to anyone.

Kigndom of Ash ★★★Reseña en español.OH POR DIOS. Pensé que, al terminar de leer esta saga que me acompañó durante tantos años, sentiría mucha satisfacción. Tal vez un poco de tristeza. ¿Pero saben qué? No siento nada de eso. Solo siento... ¿indiferencia? Estoy feliz de haberla acabado porque VAYA, sí fueron muchos años y quería saber la conclusión de la historia de Celaena Sardothien, pero en general solo estoy feliz porque ya quería que se acabara.Ahora, hablando de este libro en particular, pues estuvo bien. INNECESARIAMENTE LARGO, eso sí, pero bien. Se cerró todo lo que se tenía que cerrar y SJM se aseguró de que cada personaje tuviera su final, fuera cual fuera.Hubo partes tan aburridas que de verdad me las quería saltar, todo lo de Aedion y Ren y Rolfe y Darrow (y todos esos personajes que ya ni siquiera recordaba) no podía interesarme en lo más mínimo; pero en general todo lo demás me mantuvo entretenida, y sí tuvo uno que otro momento cardiaco. Aunque, siendo sincera, jamás temí realmente por la vida de los protagonistas (me refiero a Aelin y a Rowan).Sobre las parejas. Ay, pues qué les digo. Todas fueron muy heterosexuales, jajaja. Pero eso no es lo que más me frustra, lo que me frustra es que ¡¡¡TODOS TIENEN QUE TERMINAR CON PAREJA!!! Todos. Se me hace poco realista y muy forzado. Y obvio todos terminan siendo reinas y reyes de su respectivo territorio, ufff (pero eso ya se veía venir desde Empire of Storms).Y hablando de las parejas... no me gustan Aedion y Lysandra. Este sujeto la trató de lo peor. La humilló y la denigró. PERO AHHH CLARO, el peligro de muerte llega y ya con eso todo queda perdonado. Nope, no lo creo. Y bueno, ya saben que no soy fan de Aelin y Rowan, pero en este libro estuvieron más aguantables, las escenas de sexo no fueron tan inoportunas.¿Lo que más odié? La obsesión de SJM con el vínculo ""mate"". BASTA. Y o sea, ¡es la palabra que más se repite en el libro! My mate, my mate, mate, my mate, mate, MY MATE. Yo ya no podía más, ya solo me quedaba poner los ojos en blanco cada vez que la leía (y fueron muchas veces).¿Lo que más me gustó? Elide y Lorcan, los amo, quiero que sean felices para siempre. También me encantó el papel que jugó Yrene en el libro, creo que ella se merece todos los aplausos. OH, y no puede faltar mi adorado Dorian, todo lo que logró en este libro me hizo sentirme bien orgullosa, ¡ha crecido tanto y se ha hecho tan fuerte! Lo amo. También Manon es increíble (pero ella siempre ha sido increíble).OHHH, también me encantó que SPOILER:Al final Aelin camina victoriosa y llama a todas las mujeres y amigas que la ayudaron. Se me hizo una escena bien bonita y poderosa y llena de girl power y sororidad.Ahora quiero hablar de los personajes, esta sección VA A TENER SPOILERS, quedan advertidos. NO LEAN MÁS SI NO QUIEREN SER SPOILEADOS.Aelin: Celaena era una de mis protagonistas favoritas, la amaba y amaba leerla, pero desde que se volvió Aelin, cayó de mi gracia. Creo que en este libro pude entenderla un poco más y además pude empatizar con ella. Y si bien ya no es de mis favoritas, sí quería que las cosas salieran bien para ella. Con Aelin aplica mucho: ""Look at where you are, look at where you started."" Ella ha luchado con todo su ser durante este viaje y siempre mantuvo la esperanza. Estoy muy feliz por su felicidad.Rowan: Este sí no podía importarme menos. Me caía bien en el tercer libro, amaba su amistad con Aelin, peeeero como interés romántico es de lo peor, y como personaje... pues meh. Si él moría no me hubiera importado, aunque sí me hubiera puesto triste por Aelin, que obviamente no podría vivir sin su adorado mate. En fin. Bye Rowan.Dorian: ESTE BEBÉ HERMOSO. Jamás me gustó como interés amoroso para Aelin, pero como personaje siempre lo amé. Creo que a Dorian nunca le hicieron justicia en el amor, la tal Sorcha era súper irrelevante, siento que SJM solo la inventó para que no se quedara solo (y luego se dio cuenta de que a nadie le importaba y por eso la mató). Ahora, sí creo que Manon ha sido su mejor interés amoroso, y me gustan como pareja, pero no quiero enfocarme en eso, sino en el desarrollo del personaje. Dorian empezó siendo un simple príncipe engreído y se ha convertido en un rey digno y fuerte, ¡estoy muy orgullosa de él! Sin Dorian no hubieran podido reunir las tres llaves, y tampoco hubieran podido acabar con Erawan. Además el arco de su papá sí me conmovió. Ay, Dorian, eres el mejor.Chaol: PUES Chaol, pobre bebé. Él era mi personaje favorito de la saga, pero en el cuarto libro SJM lo arruinó por completo y logró que hasta a mí me cayera mal. Luego en Tower of Dawn empecé a soportarlo otra vez y podría decirse que se redimió. Chaol me agrada, y también estoy orgullosa de hasta donde ha llegado. ¡Y estoy feliz por él! Me encanta que sea feliz al lado de Yrene, ellos dos me gustan mucho juntos.Manon: REINA ABSOLUTA. FIN. No tengo mucho qué decir de Manon. Ella, sin duda, es mi personaje femenino favorito de esta saga. También recorrió un largo camino y aprendió mucho y no solo eso, ¡logró hasta lo imposible! Estoy muy orgullosa de ella. Bien por Manon (y Abraxos, el mejor, lo adoro).The Thirteen: Las tenía qué mencionar porque AHHHHHH, su muerte fue lo que más me enfureció (y dolió) de este libro. Cuando lo estaba leyendo no lo podía creer. ¿TODAS, SJM, ES EN SERIO? UGH, ni siquiera pude llorar, solo estaba enojada. Sí, creo que su sacrificio fue muy importante, pero también sentí que SJM simplemente se deshizo de ellas. Pobre Asterin. Pobre Manon. No supero esta muerte.Yrene: ¡Yrene salvó al mundo! Wow, creo que es el único personaje que de verdad me gustó en Tower of Dawn, y en este libro me deslumbró más. Me encanta la forma en la que enfrenta sus miedos. Me encanta que lo dé todo. Yrene para presidenta, pls.Lorcan: BEBÉ OSCURO. LO AMO. Él sí que atravesó un viaje total en este libro, y me parece curioso que SJM logró que me encariñara con él en tan pocos libros (pero bueno, sí fueron muchas páginas, jajaja). Me gusta que, aunque Lorcan demostró que tiene corazón, sigue manteniendo su esencia oscura y malvada, pero al mismo tiempo puede ser súper soft con Elide.Elide: ¡Reina también! Todos la subestimaban por su tobillo, pero ella demostró que es la mejor. Y fue otra pieza esencial para derrotar a Erawan. Además siempre se mantuvo firme en lo que quería y siempre mostró valentía. Al inicio de este libro me desesperó un poco por terca, pero en parte la entendía. Al final simplemente la amé.Fenrys: Lobito bebé. Me encantó. Ojalá que sea feliz siempre.Rhysand: Ya me habían dicho que había un momento en el que Feyre (embarazada ajá) y Rhys aparecían en el libro, y debo admitir que, cuando leí esa parte, me emocioné un poquito. Me gustó la forma en la que Rhys ayudó (?) a Aelin, creo que fue un buen toque.Y ya, creo que son los únicos que valen la pena de mencionar para mí. Los demás personajes fueron meh.Por último, iba a decir que el capítulo final me pareció muy bonito y poderoso y significativo, pero luego me enteré, por varias reseñas, que lo del Kingsflame (que fue lo que me encantó) parece una copia de El Señor de los Anillos, del Árbol Blanco de Gondor. Entonces estoy: decepcionada.Pero fuera de eso, ¡pues AHHHH, al fin acabé esta saga!'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '3.75 - 4 StarsAll things considered, I enjoyed this book and series a great deal.As the conclusion to a pretty popular and lengthy series, it had a lot riding on its massive 980 page shoulders...and a LOT of uber-emotional fangirls and boys to avoid disappointing, let\'s be real.Overall I thought Maas did a pretty decent job of it......even with all the filler, all the battles, ALL the traveling to and fro...all theunnecessary......until about page 770 or so.This book was...long. Probably longer than it needed to be, quite frankly. I saw that some people had said that - and I didn\'t agree, at first. I was more than perfectly content, even at page 600-something, to relish these characters and the individual storylines that made for such an epic ending for as long as it lasted.However, at about 770-800 pages, some events in the book made me...less than enthused. With all of the build-up regarding the final ""showdown"" and the closing of the Wyrdgate...I was bummed with the way it all went down.Not gonna lie, since the time it was all explained, I have wondered about the Wyrdgate...and been a little confused by it all in a way. So many gods, blood debts, and other stuff involved. And when it finally came to ""the moment,"" as it were, I was kind of a little miffed.Especially whenAelin ends up losing her Fire-Bringer powers.I\'m sorry, I\'m all for the ordinary being all extraordinary and all that...but I also like my ""super-heroes"" to have their super powers. And after so many books of Aelin finding and then learning to control this power...for her to just lose it in the end, right before the big battle?Also, the whole part with Dorian...When he learned how to shift, I was like, cool. That\'s cool. But when he goes to Morath, encounters Maeve, and supposedly dupes her? I just have a hard time believing he was able to do that.To overpower her and outsmart her with his magic like that after people much older and experienced with magic, i.e., Rowan and the cadre, have been unable to do so formillennia. And then, not to fucking kill her right then when presented the opportunity?And don\'t even get me started on the final showdown.Once again, Maeve seems to easily take control of everyone\'s minds (making my point with Dorian even more ridiculous),onceagain she seems to so easily overpower them all.Le sigh.It just felt drawn out and repetitive.Again.Also, I was kind of left a little blue-balled by how things ended between some of the characters. But I think by then, Maas realized she was encroaching on 1000 fucking pages. And, by then, there were just SO many damned story lines, it would have been almost a whole other book to properly ties up all the loose ends in regards to everyone\'s story, relationships, and future.But, whatever.All in all, I enjoyed the majority of this book. There were some REALLY poignant momentsManon and her Thirteen, anyone? Holy-throat-tight-with-emotion right there, people.And in the end, I think the idea that you can have friendships and relationships you would be willing to sacrifice your life for? Always powerful.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '2nd Read“I will be with you always.”this series means the world to me, and no matter how many books I read in the future, I will never, ever forget it.buddy read with caitlin! (I loved reading all of the reactions!)the ending never fails to make me cry.<><><><><><><><>“Let’s make this a fight worthy of a song.”I suppose I have to write this review now. I had to take a few hours to compose my thoughts because I was a mess once I finished this. I\'ll probably start crying while writing this review so if it gets chaotic, I\'m sorry.(also, this book sticks out like a sore thumb with the other books in this series. It\'s so bright)And once again, it took me 2-3 days to read a 900+ page book in this series. They\'re addicting.This series....I think it\'s become my favorite of all time. Even surpassingThe Cruel Prince. These characters have buried themselves into my heart and they aren\'t ever leaving. I\'ve grown to cherish and love them all and I was literally crying as I pushed myself through the final pages, not wanting to leave them. I would give anything to meet these characters and live in their world, no matter the wars that might be brewing in the book, or new villains who pop up.When I finished this book, I felt empty. I sat on my bed and stared at the wall, taking deep breaths as I realized that I would never get to read about these characters for the first time. Even when I read The Assassin\'s Blade, it will be Celaena and Sam, and I won\'t get to see these characters (Rowan, Aelin, Elide, Manon, Dorian etc)everagain.And that\'s sad.The Plot“Once upon a time, in a land long since burned to ash, there lived a young princess who loved her kingdom …”I knew this book was going to make me cry. I knew right from before I even started this series that this book would kill me because I could already tell I was going to love this series and its characters. And indeed, that did in fact happen. This plot was absolutely insane and it literally destroyed me. I found myself holding my breath many times and I was so scared someone was going to die. With such a huge cast of characters, I was afraid for everyone.There was intense battle scene after intense battle scene, and I was tense and not breathing through all of them, fearing the absolute worst. The different story lines that intertwined, the times when characters finally reunited, were absolute perfection. I honestly wouldn\'t change anything about this bookExcept more Lorcan and Elide scenes.The CharactersThis is the hardest part. Having to leave these characters behind and say goodbye. To write about them one final time. Some may call me dramatic for all of these sentimental things I\'m saying, but I\'ve grown to love and adore these characters as if they were real people. Which is kind of concerning, but that doesn\'t matter. There are a LOT of characters in this series, so there are a lot of character overviews here.Aelin Ashryver Whitethorn Galathynius“I am a god.”One of my favorite protagonists of all time. Aelin is the definition of badass, snarky, arrogant, and yet she cares so deeply for the ones she loves that she was willing to sacrifice herself for the good of her people and her friends.After the end of Empire of Storms, I was so scared as to what may happen to her. I didn\'t think Sarah J. Maas would kill off themainmain character, but I mean you never know.In all of her scenes where she was using her powers, I was grinning because Aelin was back and she was her normal sarcastic self.When she was yelling ""take it off"" over and over again- that scene ripped my heart out and stomped it into the ground. Seeing Aelin so weak and fragile was absolutely heartbreaking.I don\'t think any book protagonist can top Aelin as one of my favorites.Manon Blackbeak“We are the Thirteen,” she said. “From now until the Darkness claims us.”Manon is another one of my favorite protagonists. She\'s incredible: cold yet still loving, especially towards the Thirteen and AbraxosSpeaking of Abraxos- I thought he was going to die and I was literally crying during that scene because seeing Manon pleading to Iskra to get the bull away from Abraxos pained me so much. I was so sad for her throughout this, and especially when some things happened. But when she fought againstthe Matrons!Literal queen.Manon is such a special character and I HIGHLY doubt any character will be like her.Rowan Whitethorn“To whatever end,” he whispered.”My one true love. (Though I feel like the love has SLIGHTLY decreased since Heir of Fire but we don\'t talk about that.) Sometimes I wished he was real so badly that it hurt. Sometimes I wished I was Aelin so that Rowan would be in love withmebut we also don\'t talk about that.He went through so much in this book, his agony from being separated from Aelin was killing me. When Maeve made him have that vision of Aelin? I was tearing up so badly, the tears threatening to spill onto the book. The love he has for Aelin is incredible. I\'m not jealous. I\'m not-Yes I am.His love and respect for his Cadre is also one of my favorite things. I love how he gets along with them and how he actually cares for them.Rowan is irreplaceable in my heart.Dorian Havilliard“Together,” Dorian breathed, shaking. “We’ll rebuild this world together.”This scene gutted me and made me cry so hard.I\'ve loved Dorian since the very beginning. He was my favorite in the first book. I watched as he grew into the character he is right now through the series, as he grew into his powers, into his friendships and relationships. I adore Dorian with all of my heart. The stuff he had to go through in this book and series is awful, but so admirable, especially in this book.Though I must admit, some of those things Dorian said while shifted into a woman were just NO.He was willing to risk his own life for the sake of the kingdom. Willing to take Aelin\'s spot for the sake of the kingdom.Dorian deserves everything.Elide Lochan“Life—life was pain. Pain, and joy. Joy because of the pain. He saw it in Elide’s face.”I love Elide so much. Her character growth and her strengths are incredible. I love her growing friendship with Yrene and how she helped so many people. Her relationships with Aelin and Manon are forever some of my favorites as well.And when she went out onto the battlefield to find Lorcan I was literally crying because I wasterrifiedthat she or him would die. That scene was probably the scariest one of the whole book. I was honestly convinced that if one of the characters died in this book, it would be Elide or Lorcan.Elide is so strong and courageous and she\'s certainly one of my favorite protagonists in this series.Aedion Ashryver“Together,” Aedion rasped.”This. Scene.Aedion is incredible. Sometimes. I hated how he treated Lysandra in this book. It did make sense as to why he was angry, but Lysandra and Aelin had come up with the plan, but he hadnoright to do what he did to her, and call her what he did in the fits of anger. When Lysandra called him out on them, it felt like a breath of fresh air.But Aedion is still a really good character, once he realized his mistakes. He\'s strong and certainly cares for his cousin and friends. I felt so bad for him when acertainscene happened.LysandraAshryver- I didn\'t know her last name so I may as well put this one in“Remember that we have something to fight for, and it will always triumph.”I love her character. She\'s so sarcastic and fun, but yet so nice and loving. She isn\'t my favorite character in this series, but she\'s still such an amazing character and I love her.Lorcan SalvaterreAKA Lord Lorcan Lochan- I\'m never getting over that name“So Lorcan said softly, “I meant every word.”I loved that scene. I still do love that scene.Lorcan got off to a rough start in this series for me- at first I was indifferent towards him, unsure how to feel, but he has EASILY reached one of my favorites. He just seems so hard on the outside, but yet he is so sweet.To Elide at leastThe sacrifices he made and how he redeemed himself from the end of EoS which had been a COMPLETE misunderstanding made me love him even MORE.I want a spin-off with him andElideplease and thank you.Chaol Westfall“Be the bridge, be the light. When iron melts, when flowers spring from fields of blood—let the land be witness, and return home.”I was surprised at how little Chaol was in this in the beginning, and even more surprised at how much I wanted to read his chapters. I shouldn\'t have been that surprised, considering I learned to love him in Tower of Dawn, but still. Chaol\'s leadership skills shone through in this book, and how much he cares for Yrene is amazing.I know he\'s going to have a wonderful life.Yrene Westfall“For across every mountain, spread beneath the green canopy of Oakwald, carpeting the entire Plain of Theralis, the kingsflame was blooming.”Yrene is in the top 5 of my favorite characters in this series. While I do prefer her in Tower of Dawn, mainly because she wasactuallya main character and focus in that book, she was still incredible in this book. She literally saved them all in more ways than one.If I forgot any characters, apologies, because I can\'t think of them all. Here are a few notes on other characters:Fenrys:I always will adore Fenrys. I was terrified for him throughout this book, especially in the beginning.Nesryn:A natural born leader. I loved how she was with Sartaq and all of that army, and how she fought alongside Aelin. I love her character.I don\'t want to leave these characters.The RelationshipsI think the relationships in this series are one of the best parts. They all have such good chemistry, and because I don\'t want to spoil people, I\'m gonna have to put most of them in spoiler tags.Rowan and Aelin“To whatever end?” she breathed. Rowan followed her, as he had his entire life, long before they had ever met, before their souls had sparked into existence. “To whatever end, Fireheart.”I will always and forever shout about my eternal love for these two. I\'ve shipped them since I found out about them, before I even read the series, and I will continue to ship them my whole life. No one compares to the love that these two have. It hurt me so much when these two were parted, when they felt the mate bond pulling thin. But they always find each other in the end. They are one of the greatest love stories I have had the pleasure of reading about.Nothing and no one in a book willevercompare to the love these two share.Elide and Lorcan“Ask me to marry you.”Elide began crying, even as she laughed. “Will you marry me, Lorcan Salvaterre?”He swept her up into his arms, raining kisses over her face. As if some final, chained part of him had been freed. “I’ll think about it.”I love these two almost as much as Rowan and Aelin. And that\'s saying something.I was scared that these two were going to die together, especially during that battlefield scene,especiallywhen Lorcan was about to throw himself off of the horse to save Elide\'s life. The immense slowburn and tension they had throughout this book was insane. I was scared that they weren\'t gonna get back together, but I shouldn\'t have doubted them. Their scenes were so sweet, especially the one with the quote above.We also love the ""hates everyone but her"" trope and Lorcan is practically the definition of that trope. Though I have a feeling that he grows fond of Aelin.“I love you,” he whispered in Elide’s ear. “I have loved you from the moment you picked up that axe to slay the ilken.” Her tears flowed past him in the wind. “And I will be with you …” His voice broke, but he made himself say the words, the truth in his heart. “I will be with you”This line caused me to lose it.Also, I waited the whole entire book just for a ""AnD So LorCan DiD."" WHAT DID HE DO HUH?? I WAITED THE THREE OR WHATEVER BOOKS FOR A FADE TO BLACK??Thank goodness for fanfictionManon and DorianWhy. Can\'t. I. Find. Any. QUOTES FOR THEM? I mean, I\'ve scoured the internet and the only way for me to find one myself is to go back into that 900+ page book to find one and that is certainly not happening.Anyways, I am in desperate need of an endgame with these two. I have no doubt that they end up together after this book, but I NEED confirmation! Fanart, fanfiction, and my mind are not enough. I just need hope.But these two are amazing. They fought for each other throughout and I need them to marry, just like they kept ""joking"" about. Even Yrene brought it up. So yes, I am going to tell myself that these two marry. No one can stop me.Chaol and Yrene“Yrene is the finest healer of her generation,” Chaol said with deadly quiet. “Her worth is greater than any crown.”Despite how I flipped out when I realized that Yrene was pregnant the second she put her hand on her stomach, I grew to not mind it. BUT. If the baby had been born ON PAGE, yeah no, I would\'ve been so mad. Babies ruin everything in books. That\'s why I HATE imagining my favorite characters with children. I hate it.But anyways, I love these two. The same as always, they are devoted to each other, and when Chaol was becoming so overprotective of Yrene was so sweet.Aedion and Lysandra“So Aedion leaned in, and kissed Lysandra, kissed the woman who should have been his wife, his mate, one last time.”I thought they were going to die after this scene and I was flipping out.I knew these two would get together the INSTANT they met each other earlier in the series. The chemistry was undeniable, and I do like these two together. They may be my least favorite couple, but I still have lots of love to give to them.This review did take a chaotic turn. But that\'s fine. I liked writing it out, writing about these characters one last time. It sure has been a journey, exploring the depths of this series and learning more about the characters. I wish I never have to go.But all good things must come to an end.And so, I have finally completed the Throne of Glass series. (not counting The Assassin\'s Blade) This review may have been slightly dramatic, but I\'m dramatic, so that is fine. I\'m going to miss these characters and world so much, so I may as well convey all of my feelings into this review. And yeah, I did cry while writing this.These characters have forever impacted me with their words and stories, and I will never forget this series.5 stars“Be the bridge, be the light. When iron melts, when flowers spring from fields of blood—let the land be witness, and return home.”<><><><><><><><>nothing will ever comparertc<><><><><><><><>Why is the book so big though'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'This review and other non-spoilery reviews can be found@The Book Prescription“Once upon a time, in a land long since burned to ash, there lived a young princess who loved her kingdom …🌟 You may like Sarah J. Maas writing, you may hate it. Actually SJM may be the most controversial author at the current time. So we may agree to disagree on her style but I think something that we can not deny is her immense success and how big this series has got. In my 3 years on GR and few month of blogging, I have never seen a book that took over those sites as this book did.🌟 I remember finishing 2016 with starting Throne of Glass which was a great gift from a friend. I wanted to end 2016 and start 2017 with a bang and reflecting back On this, I don’t regret it.🌟 Keep in mind that I am also not a SJM stan, I just appreciate a good book and this series had its ups and downs but I am so glad it had a good ending. I am also not one of those people who started the series when book 1 was released. I actually read the whole series in 1 year.🌟 I don’t usually include all the previous books ratings in a review but I am adding it here this time to prove a point:Throne of Glass ★★★★Crown of Midnight ★★★★★Heir of Fire ★★★Queen of shadows ★★★Empire of storms ★★★★Tower of Dawn ★★★🌟 I am actually thankful for Sarah for entertaining us with7 books532 Chapters4464 Pages🌟We haven’t actually gone into the review yet so let’s get down to it:🌟 The world building was great, I love this world, I love the magic, the different creatures and the politics were amazing too. I like that this is a hard magic system that is bound by rules and that it is not just random and chaotic. I also know Erilea’s map by heart and I didn’t have to go back to the map at a certain point to check what was happening because it was all right in my mind.🌟 I always used to say that Shatter me series has one of the best character development in books! Sadly that was shattered in restore me🌟 Now I am going to say that this is one of the series that I love the characters of. How they started and what they ended up being. In my previous reviews I criticized how Sarah always uses the term beautiful and most beautiful and gorgeous…etc to describe her characters. There are many many characters in this series and UNFORTUNATELY they are all beautiful! And she even went to say that a character could only be described as beautiful and I was like: “It can be described by many things but you don’t want to brain storm even a little bit”.🌟 That being said, I love Aelin & Rowan, Aedion & Lysandra (my favs), Chaol & Yrene, Elide & Lorcan, Dorian and Manon, Asterin and the Thirteen, I even like Abraxos!🌟 I think Sarah can write the best ships ever, I always feel the chemistry between those characters and some of them started differently and I thought that they were not a good match until they really weren’t!🌟 There are some series that you read and forget the characters after a few books and there are some characters that are meant to stay with you, affect you and change you and obviously this is the later choice! I can’t stop thinking about the sass, the retorts and comebacks of some characters. You can’t believe how scared I was while reading this book, because there was going to be a major war and I was worried about my babies! I didn’t know who was going to survive and who wouldn’t and that’s just war! I am not sure if I am totally satisfied with how things go but I can see why Sarah did certain things that way!“Aelin wiped her hands. “Well, that’s over and done with,” she announced, and strode to the desk and map. “Shall we discuss where you all plan to march once we beat the living shit out of this army?”🌟 Regarding Manon by the way, she was not described differently in this book and that was a bit better than expected.🌟 Now the writing was good, the references and planning since book 1 is just mind blowing. There were some good quotes (Captain Obvious strikes again, It is almost 1000 pages so it is bound to have some good quotes). Sometimes though, I felt that Sarah was like a toddler who learnt a new word and was saying it all the time to everyone and this word is Sarah’s renowned “Mate”. If you notice it once, it can not be unnoticed and becomes very annoying specially that it is repeated more than a 100 times!!🌟 The plot at the end of book 5 peaked and left us wondering about many things making this one of my most anticipated reads of the year! The plot was interesting from the first till the last page! I complained about how Sarah’s books were bigger than needed and yet I felt that I need MORE this time! I don’t know how I read 1000 pages in 5 days.🌟 I like (I certainly like a lot of things) that each small group of characters were having their own adventure and their own goals and they all converge to make the bigger plot at the last pages! That was better than a linear way of telling the story. And that there were not ex machina moments in this book, everything made sense and the foreshadowing was top-notch! I feel like reading the series again just to catch all the hidden clues and be mesmerized again. Did I mention that the series was first written when Sarah was 16?!!! I am currently writing a short story and it is so hard but to start writing a whole series at 16 is just mind-blowing.🌟 I can’t deny that there are problems with the series and I know that SJM is just great at writing white characters, I don’t know why she’s trying to ruin her books with false half-cooked diversity that brought more problems than benefits to her. I am one of those readers who are convinced that no diversity is better than bad and forces diversity. But one thing I can not understand too is how there are people who hate the series and yet they read the 7 books, isn’t that a bit hard to understand?🌟 Summary: I usually rate books according to the elements of the story and how they come out together and how well they were written. And although I don’t deny the problems in this book, I think it is amazing that a book caught my attention for a 1000 pages. I am rating this one on both my analysis of the story and out of pure enjoyment.🌟 I can’t believe that this is coming to an end! Sarah J Maas, here are 5 stars and Thanks a lot!! To a better world!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I am in tears. This was absolutely perfect. I have no complaints, no remarks, no anything. I wouldn't change it at all. SJM wrote a masterpiece and am absolutely in awe of it 😭❤️KoA is easily the best book in the series for me. Sure, it's hugee. But the characters, the story, the romance, the war and sheer beauty of it all was mesmerizing to read.How come there's no tv series for it yet?!It started with such intensity and heaviness. Aelin, Rowan and Fenrys are the winners for me in this book, they broke and mend my heart. Chaol and Dorian coming in next, with Manon, Lorcan and Elide at the end. I know it's an odd way of ranking but that's the way they impacted me.If you haven't read this series, DO READ IT. Pls 🥺🥺I have some theories in my drafts but before posting them.

The Woman in Me
",Britney Spears,3.85,490404,217000,"Nonfiction, Audiobook, Memoir, Biography, Autobiography, Music, Biography Memoir",288,24-10-2023,"The Woman in Meis a brave and astonishingly moving story about freedom, fame, motherhood, survival, faith, and hope.In June 2021, the whole world was listening as Britney Spears spoke in open court. The impact of sharing her voice—her truth—was undeniable, and it changed the course of her life and the lives of countless others.The Woman in Mereveals for the first time her incredible journey—and the strength at the core of one of the greatest performers in pop music history.Written with remarkable candor and humor, Spears’s groundbreaking book illuminates the enduring power of music and love—and the importance of a woman telling her own story, on her own terms, at last.","[{'rating': 4, 'content': ""At what point did I promise to stay seventeen for the rest of my life?Growing up, I remember being fascinated by Britney Spears. Not only did I love her music—I'm a pop fan through and through—but at a time when I was an awkward teenager, she seemed to have it all: the voice, the confidence, the adulation of millions. Now looking back, I realize it must've all been a façade.Reading Britney's words was so sad and heartbreaking. How is it that this girl had no one in her corner? Every single person she loved and trusted would go on to eventually stab her in the back in the most awful and exploitative ways possible. Let's enumerate, shall we?Her father — Definitely a shoo-in for Most Awful Father of the Year Award. Took her money, committed her to psychiatric wards for no reason, kept her from her kids, gaslighted her, dictated every big and small thing in her life. The list goes on. And this went on for 13 years. What the fuck. How is this legal and why is this guy not in jail?Her mother — Just stood by and watched it all happen. Tried to profit off of her name and fame.Her siblings — Ditto.Ex-husband K-Fed — The ultimate deadbeat. Took her kids from her and prevented her from seeing them. Clearly sought sole custody to squeeze as much child support money from her as possible. And apparently a judge went along with it.Justin Timberlake — Made a big fucking deal out of her cheating on him and breaking his heart. Turns out, he's the serial cheater in their relationship. Also made her have an abortion because he wasn't ready to be a dad. Then went on to break up with her over text, paint her as a harlot, and profit off of her public shaming. Well, can't listen to his music anymore, that's for sure.Over the years, there were things that puzzled me about Britney. But reading what she went through and what these people did to her, it all makes sense. I would've shaved my head too if it was the only way I could show some small amount of autonomy, that I wasn't just a body on display, a cash cow existing solely to make money for my parents.Thirteen years is a long time to lose control of your life. How can she get back the time she lost, to have the relationship she wanted with her kids or the career she imagined? She can't. That's what's so heartbreaking about all this. She can only look ahead and move forward, hopefully without bitterness or regret.The writing style is simple and straightforward. Even though Britney used a ghostwriter, it sounds very much like her real voice. There is a rawness and vulnerability that permeates the pages. Though the book never holds back on revelations, it does feel at times like it's just scratching the surface. Even though she talks about all the horrible things that have happened to her, it still comes across so polite, as if she's holding back, afraid to offend those who have done her wrong.I had trouble getting through the book even though it isn't long. Parts of it were so gut-wrenching and horrible that I had to take frequent breaks. Especially when she talks about how her ex-husband and her family would keep her away from her young babies for weeks at a time, it made my heart hurt so bad for her.This memoir is a long time coming. After enduring so much and keeping her silence, I'm glad Britney finally has a chance to speak out and tell her truth. Everyone has the right to live the life they want, and after everything, I hope she finally finds the peace and happiness she's been searching for for so long.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '11/25: UPDATE because it feels necessary to say after a few incredibly rude comments. You canrespectfullydisagree with my review all you want but if you are leaving a disparaging comment towards me, don\'t waste your time. The moment that you start personally attacking me, your comment will be deleted and you will be blocked because I won\'t tolerate it :) We can have different opinions on a book and still respect each other AND each others\' opinions. Let\'s act like adults.________________________________________________Nobody wants to be the bad guy and give this memoir a low rating so I guess it will be me.Britney has been through hell and reading this story is incredibly sad. God, I feel for her. Imagine being locked up for all of your 30s, never being able to make a decision for yourself, and being re-released into the world in your 40s; imagine having to reinvent yourself and reshape your identity after all of that… It’s unfortunate that, when she was younger, she never had someone to hold her hand and help her when she was going through her darkest moments and clearly suffering from mental illness. Hallelujah that she made it out on the other side of her conservatorship. I\'m proud of her BUTThis isn\'t even close to a five star read for me. People are going to call this the best memoir of the year and they are entitled to that opinion. As someone who spends a lot of time reading memoirs though, I can\'t help but feel that this one doesn\'t even come close to ""the best"". But I get it... I get the urge to give five stars regardless because her life was extremely challenging and it\'s impossible to imagine how someone could make it through something like she did. I almost did. But I am not rating her life or worthiness here, my friends. I never am when I rate a memoir. I am here to rate the BOOK and the book alone. With that said...→ Even with a ghostwriter, this was a mess. It reads like a young girl\'s journal and extremely lacked the emotional depth and introspection that you typically see in memoirs. The writing was elementary and fragmented and a lot of it felt like she wrote it just to diss to certain people. Don\'t get me wrong, these people more than deserved the diss, but the point still stands. As someone who said that she gets upset because people are talking behind her back, giving interviews about her without her permission, it\'s just an interesting approach is all I\'m saying.Parts of the story feel missing or only scrape the surface. I don’t feel that readers can gain a sense of who the real Britney is from this.There are certainly takeaways that I got from this book but I\'m left with more questions than anything. I would have loved to have seen more backstory about her rise to fame because she hardly spent any time on it at all. Her real-life story is truly remarkable and I admire her courage, strength, and resilience. I’m happy she’s free now but I could have done without this book at this time. Had this been written with more time away from her trauma (and therefore more time for healing), I think it would have felt more powerful for me. Sometimes people want/need a story in the messy middle of trauma though and that\'s what this book was.'}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""*no rating —this is not a bedtime story for me to judge whether or not I liked it and had a good time; this is her telling me about her life and how she experienced it.(edit: maybe don't look at this book as a great piece of literature but as her chosen medium to tell her story in peace on her own terms.)I am speechless and my chest feels tight after reading this book —her side of the story.I was on a concert of her Onyx Hotel Tour back in 2004 and it pains me to learn now that this one was so rough for her to do at the time she even describes it as a mistake. That I was celebrating a great performer that night while she was already suffering inside, putting on a brave face.As a Britney fanof 25 years I loved the opportunity to finally listen to her story as a whole in her own voice and I am grateful that she told it.It was certainly not easy to read. It was actually pretty heavy and even brutal at times and I’m amazed by Britney’s strength that she survived all these years at allconsidering what she’s been through in her private life, with the media and professionally. And I don’t only mean the conservatorship. Even before this book released I was, but even more so now.Even though I was being described as so rebellious and such a wild girl, all my best work was accomplished during that time [*]. All in all, though, it was a terrible time.[*while I was supposedly so incapacitated that I had to be controlled by my family]As a book loverI must say the reading experience was, sadly, rather meh, to be honest. The first third of the book reads a bit like a confusing wikipedia page; I guess the purpose of it was to just bring us up to speed of what her life was like and what lead up to the events she really wanted to tell us about. The “storytelling” went smoother after that, though. But I don’t want to judge the writing of this book too harshly because I honestly don’t have much experience with memoirs and very little to compare it to. And also, just because.(see first note above)So yeah,despite the bumpy start I can only recommend to listen to what she has to sayabout her life and the time when no one seemed interested to listen or later when she had no voice at all.Freedom means being goofy, silly, and having fun on social media. Freedom means taking a break from Instagram without people calling 911. Freedom means being able to make mistakes, and learning from them. Freedom means I don’t have to perform for anyone—onstage or offstage. Freedom means that I get to be as beautifully imperfect as everyone else. And freedom means the ability, and the right, to search for joy, in my own way, on my own terms.Yes, do exactly that, girl. Enjoy.

After reading this, I am angry!! I am angry at her pathetic, non-supportive, and controlling family for what they have put Britney through. I am angry at all the loser men that have preyed upon her kindness and naivety. I am angry at the media and paparazzi for exposing her as a mad woman. I am angry that it took years for anyone to finally help her. I am angry that someone this rich and famous can be taken advantage of.This was a fast story to read, but believe me it told enough. I’m so glad that Britney was able to finally tell her side of the story. This story starts off with Britney as a young girl and her upbringing. Right away, I knew her parents weren’t right because she told stories of how her father (Mr. Conservator), was an alcoholic and could never keep a job or pay the bills when she was growing up. Britney’s “wonderful” mother would also take her out drinking when she was only 13 years old. Her mom also had her driving the car around at 13. Oh, and don’t worry- because they were so poor, they got Britney into show business so she could pay the bills. Yay Mom and Dad 👏Even though Britney bought her parents, and that little sister Jamie Lynn Spears everything they could ever want or need- that still wasn’t enough. They wanted total control of Britney. And if anyone is familiar with dysfunctional families and the family scapegoat, it’s quite obvious Britney was and always will be the family scapegoat. No matter how great or famous she is, they will always find something wrong with her no matter what. (Sad to say, but I’ve lived through this family dynamic my whole life as well).When Britney went through the worst times of her life- her breakup with Justin Timberlake, her divorce from Kevin Federline (K-Fed- total douchebag), her meltdowns in and due to the paparazzi. No one was there for her. No. One. All her family did was tell her she was crazy and a disgrace. They watched her every move through a microscope (just like the paparazzi)- so they could put her in a conservatorship for 13 years and control everything about her.While in the conservatorship, her father controlled what she wore, what time she went to bed, her phone was monitored, she was given a measly weekly allowance, and he even controlled what she ate. For two years straight, Britney only ate chicken and vegetables from a can. And through this time her dad continuously told her she was fat! Ughhhh!!I could really go on much longer, but I would spoil the whole book. I didn’t go into too much detail about my thoughts on Justin Timberlake (okay, I did previously mention that he was a weird looking little weasel), and K-Fed 🤮. During the writing of this book she was still married to Hesam (Sam) Asghari, and still very much in love. But we all know, Britney and Sam have since divorced.I hope Britney gets to be the woman she wants to be, and to live the life she deserves moving forward. I pray that she stays far away from her toxic, evil, manipulative family. I pray that she has a loving relationship with her sons, and hopefully her family and K-Fed haven’t gaslighted and brainwashed them against their mother too bad. I hope her sons read this book, and build a relationship with Britney. I also hope Britney stays single for a while to heal and find herself…In case you haven’t noticed- yes, I highly recommend this book!! I also hope Britney gets a ton of money from this book and laughs all the way to the bank while her family sits and rots!'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'As much as society loves to build up an idol they love to watch one fall and burn. This is especially true when the celebrity icon is a woman and one that can become a symbol of castigation such as the case of Britney Spears. Having been molded into an icon that was both highly sexualized yet also virginal and youthful, Spears skyrocketed to stardom and made many rich folks far richer but then that same celebrity image was turned into a weapon against her. But who is Spears behind the image that was created of her? ‘It’s time for me not to be someone who other people want,’ she writes inThe Woman in Me, her new memoir, ‘it’s time to actually find myself.’ While it reads like a slow burn horror of a woman exploited, shamed and imprisoned by those closest to her, Spears never comes across as angry and the book feels less like a tell-all than it does a search for who she that is asking the same question her fans have been asking while pouring over her Instagram for clues: is she okay? This book is also an tragic example in the long history of how fragile women\'s rights over financial and bodily control are and that mental health has long been used against them as a way to remove those rights. A quick read that seems to fly through events at the same pace that her career seemed to be moving, it is hard to not feel compassion and sadness for Spears as she finds her voice and gives us insight into her mind during the whirlwind of a life that practically made as many headlines as the number of records she sold. ‘I wanted to hide, but I also wanted to be seen,’ she says, ‘both things could be true,’ and here we can finally see Spears on her terms as she deserves to be seen.‘Music stopped the noise, made me feel confident, and took me to a pure place of expressing myself exactly as I wanted to be seen and heard.’Britney Spears was everywhere when I was growing up, she was impossible to not know and even if you didn’twantto know you couldn’t escape the media’s narrative of her rise and unraveling. I was the right age where I could pretend I didn’t love her music and that I only knew every lyric to every song because my younger sister was a huge fan, but lets face it: Britney was an icon, her music was catchy, she WAS pop culture. There’s no way I’m not reading her memoir, I’m too invested in this story simply from being alive and into music when I was. It’s lovely to know she has beenfreed from her conservatorship, where her own father and lawyers took complete control over her for 13 years, but the whole story seems a large metaphor for what celebrity means in capitalism: you are lessyouand more a product to be controlled by corporate lawyers and marketing execs (remember when John Foggertylost a lawsuit suing him over plagiarising the sounds of John Foggerty, since his voice and style were technically owned by a record company?). While this book leaves a long list of names to be angry and appalled at, Spears never comes across as angry. More sad, almost apologetic, and merely telling what happened. In fact so much of this feels dispassionate, as if she is tired beyond the capacity for rightful rage. But also it seems a lesson long beaten into her that women don’t get to be angry, that anything other than passive acceptance makes her a villain. Which is truly tragic and so much of this book reminds us of the long history of misogyny, of policing women’s bodies, words, tone, actions, and any other aspect of their lives. And how, because of this, women are shamed into feeling they deserve the abuse, as Spears shows when she writes \'the sadness and the loneliness that would hit me felt like my fault somehow, like I deserved unhappiness and bad luck.\' Which is just so heartbreaking.‘Why did my managers work so hard to claim I was some kind of young-girl virgin even into my twenties?’Much has been written about the way Spears image was to take a young, virginal image of a girl and sexualize her for the sake of men’s lusts. She has often been discussed in comparison with Dolores Haze from Nabokov’sLolitafor the sexualization of a teenage girl (such as the music video with Spears in a risque school girl outfit dancing in the halls of a high school, though Spears admits here that the outfit was her idea). In herarticleon the recent documentary series,Framing Britney Spears, Grace O’Neil writes that ‘Britney is Dolores and we—the public who voraciously consumed her—are a pack of Humberts,’ and that her image was a “safe” way for men to satisfy a taboo lust. Though Tavi Gevinson, in anarticle you should definitely readas it is not just about Spears but power dynamics in general, points out that the documentary is ‘eager to characterize Spears’s early image as an expression of female power rather than the corporation-sanctioned sexualization of a 16-year-old’ Which is a key thing, it was an image created to give the feeling that she was in control and sexually liberated, but as we all saw, it was also the way she was demonized and we should ‘engage the messier implications of the virginal-but-sexy archetype:Here is a girl who can perform sex for an audience’s benefit, but who, thank God, has not yet been tainted by experience.America’s response to Spears was puritanical, but so was the fantasy her image fulfilled.’ We also see in this book how breaking from the \'fantasy\' is a reason to condemn her, but also remove her agency. It should be noted that the ""hysteria"" was a mental disorder that was attributed to women (until 1980), and was often used as a way to strip women of their rights and autonomy. Being labeled as ""crazy"" did just this to Spears.Spears shows how so much of her life was controlled by a very calculated misogyny, such as theRolling Stonesphotoshoot with David LaChapelle that captilazied on the sexualization of a teenage girl. As Gevinson argues that Spears was never in control, and this was also calculated in order to allow people to turn a blind eye from the ways she was abused.‘There is no need to believe it’s eitherEverything was Britney’s choice, and therefore she was always a sex-positive feminist or Nothing was Britney’s choice, and the evil adults made all her decisions.Both assertions sound desperate to protect her respectability — another version of her purity, in fact — as a prerequisite for compassion. They remind me of how readily conversations about abuse and assault focus on the moral character of the victim in order to confirm that they have indeed been victimized.’The first half of Spears book very quickly takes us through her career, though it is less an autopsy of her stardom and more a litany of harms. If this were a film we would cut directly from her telling Ed McMahon on Star Search at age 10 that she doesn’t have a boyfriend because ‘boys are mean’ to a montage of the her relationships with Justin Timeberlake and Kevin Federline. ‘Looking back, I think that both Justin and Kevin were very clever. They knew what they were doing, and I played right into it,” she writes, and shows how her desire to be loved became an opening to be exploited (OKAY but the moment she got to Timberlake being all ‘let me play you some soothing guitar’ as shes crying on the floor from the pain of her abortion she was very much pressured into having--not great JT). We also see how she was just access to fame for Federline and that he had no interest in being a father. And it all ends poorly for Spears, especially once the conservatorship begins. And if there is anyone to truly be mad at, it is her parents and management that failed to protect her and instead capitalized on all the drama.‘I was so beaten down by all of it that I just surrendered.’All these events happened at a time of really heightened celebrity in the US spurred by channels like MTV that shifted the focus away from the actual music and into a celebration of privileged lifestyles. While shows like Jackass turned men with massive drug, alcohol and mental health problems into household names to laugh WITH while celebrity women became icons to laugh AT (and shamed for alcohol, drugs, sex or mental health struggles). Everyone seemed way too eager to see Spears have a public breakdown, everyone was excited for cameras to capture the next Lindsey Lohan binge, everyone enjoyed calling Paris Hilton dumb a bit too much to consider it harmless fun. Being joyful at someone’s supposed shortcomings is never cool but it became a commodity, and much of this seemed to be orchestrated to mock women who rose to stardom almost as some gross patriarchal lesson. It happens all the time but it was practically the focus of US entertainment aimed at youth culture. And it’s because the industry saw them all as products not people.That’s why reading this felt like a damning indictment against the way patriarchal societies objectify, commoditize, consume and control women. Britney was caged into a message to young women to be commoditized, to be docile and nice, to be exploited and happy for it or be punished. In her bookEntitled: How Male Privilege Hurts Women, Dr.Kate Mannelays out the various ways men feel entitled to women’s bodies, labor, affection, etc. and this book practically goes through each of her points to check the boxes. On women’s bodies, for example:‘It was always incredible to me that so many people felt so comfortable talking about my body. It had started when I was young. Whether it was strangers in the media or within my own family, people seemed to experience my body as public property: something they could police, control, criticize, or use as a weapon. My body was strong enough to carry two children and agile enough to execute every choreographed move perfectly onstage. And now here I was, having every calorie recorded so people could continue to get rich off my body.’There is a similar message inEmily Ratajkowski’s memoirMy Body. Sure, people will say that is the price of fame, but that isnot okayand is just a way to hold an umbrella for abuse. Hop on social media right now and you’ll see plenty of people shaming Britney for this book and especially for having aborted the baby without acknowledging the emotional pressures put on her to do so or the way her whole life she was coached to not have any agency. She talks about how she notices the questions Timberlake was asked in interviews were very different than the type she got, which often asked about her body. It also plays into Dr. Manne’s idea onhimpathy—that is the way people tend to sympathize with a man over a woman even when he is the abuser and demand she prove she isn’t somehow complicit in her own abuse—which we see in the way society rallied around Justin and hisCry Me A Riversong and began to look at Spears as a heartless heartbreaker when in realityI was shattered…I don’t think Justin realised the power he had in shaming me. I don’t think he understands to this day.’ And when things started to come apart, she was labeled as crazy and deserving of scorn instead of recognizing the mental health issues ‘because I now know that I was displaying just about every symptom of perinatal depression: sadness, anxiety, fatigue.’What did anyone expect when she was treated as unable to take care of herself and like a perpetual 17 year old sex icon her whole life. ‘I’d begin to think in some ways like a child,’ she admits. But it was also a rage against the world.‘Shaving my head was a way of saying to the world: Fuck you. You want me to be pretty for you? Fuck you. You want me to be good for you? Fuck you. You want me to be your dream girl? Fuck you. I’d been the good girl for years.’This book very well explores the way she was built into this image and then silenced for breaking it. And the latter half about the 13 years under the conservatorship are horrifying. ‘For thirteen years, I wasn\'t allowed to eat what I wanted, to drive, to spend my money how I wanted, to drink alcohol or even coffee,’ she says, but now she has ‘freedom to do what I want to do has given me back my womanhood. In my forties, I\'m trying things for what feels like the first time. I feel like the woman in me was pushed down for so long.’ I’m glad to see she is able to feel she has a voice and search for what freedom means for her, but also for who she is. This is a quick read, a sad one too, but it is nice to hear her side and remember how harsh society is on women. Especially the ones they prop up for profit and then profit off of watching them burn down. I hope for nothing but the best and inner peace for Spears.⅘‘I\'ve started to experience the riches of being an adult woman for the first time in many years. I feel like I\'ve been underwater for so long, only rarely swimming up to the surface to gasp for air and a little food. When I regained my freedom, that was my cue to step out onto dry land and, any time I want, to take vacations, sip a cocktail, drive my car, go to a resort, or stare out at the ocean.’'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'I was a huge spears friend when I was a teenager, even trying to learn her dance in one more time (spoiler alert: I made my parents laugh).

I had a library hold with an estimated wait of 6-18 weeks, but somehow managed to snag a skip-the-line copy.- The trade-off is I only have 7 (now 6) days to finish this. Which shouldn\'t be a problem, but it\'s still a major risk.(2) This should check off my ""non-fiction"" and ""recent mega-bestseller"" reading goals for the year.01/18/2024- Prologue–Chapter 8(1) In addition to being full of personality, the start of the book, up to the account of her birth, is beautifully written.- Even just reading the two-paragraph prologue, I already have a far greater sense of Britney Spears the person than I ever did of Meghan Markle in the entirety of Prince Harry\'s ""Spare""—2023\'s other blockbuster memoir.- Just from the prologue, we learn what she did in her spare time, how her family life was, and a bit of what she believes spiritually.(2) ""When I was alone with my thoughts, my mind filled with worries and fears. Music stopped the noise, made me feel confident, and took me to a pure place of expressing myself exactly as I wanted to be seen and heard. Singing took me into the presence of the divine.""- Britney writes at length about her family history of alcoholism and abuse, stretching back several generations. It\'s seemingly a chain reaction that might explain her stranger, more erratic public moments, though she herself makes no direct connection.- The whole idea of performing as a way to escape personal chaos and exert some control over life can be a bit cliché, but she writes with enough warts-and-all honesty that it really does work here.- In contrast to some other autobiographies I\'ve read, she\'s not trashing her family. You get the sense that all this is written with love and not mean-spiritedness.(3) This being a musician\'s memoir, it starts off with a section about what singing means to her. It\'s the best written portion of the book, which makes sense since you\'d want to make the best first impression, if anything for the sake of juicing up free preview chapters.- The book, however, does settle down into more straightforward and plain-spoken stories. Once she steps into the picture, and the sordid family history\'s over, the book feels less special. Though, it\'s no chore to read—I actually have to make an effort to stop.(4) For some reason, it\'s always fascinating to me when famous people meet other famous people when they\'re not famous.- Britney Spears and Natalie Portman being co-understudies for an off-Broadway musical feels like such a weird pairing.(5) ""By thirteen, I was drinking with my mom and smoking with my friends. I had my first cigarette at my one \'bad\' friend\'s house.""- Given her family history, I suspected that bad habits and vices might be passed down from parent to child. It\'s just strange to hear of a parent directly encouraging those vices, and at such a young age.- Her mom does have a major problem with Britney smoking, so there\'s at least that, though she\'s a smoker herself—they\'re both Virginia Slims girls.(6) ""The night before we recorded \'… Baby One More Time,\' I was listening to Soft Cell’s \'Tainted Love\' and fell in love with that sound. I stayed up late so that I’d go into the studio tired, my voice fried. It worked. When I sang, it came out gravelly in a way that sounded more mature and sexier.""- All the cigarette smoking probably helped that too, to be honest.- Sure,that\'swhy you stayed up so late.- Next time I listen to that song, I\'m going to have to pay attention for that.(7) Britney loses her virginity at 13 to her 17 year-old boyfriend.- So, that whole bit about still being a virgin was totally bogus, eh? I feel so disillusioned!01/19/2024- Chapters 9–17(1) Britney likes to describe herself as ""innocent"" a lot.- Every time she does I can\'t help but think, ""But you\'re \'not that innocent,\' you told us so!""(2) Wow! Apparently, Justin Timberlake\'s a real scumbag! I\'d have never guessed.- Their relationship sort of reminds me of Charles and Diana: he openly cheats on her, so she cheats on him.- Britney and Justin lived together in Orlando when she was still in her teens. I can\'t tell you how many times while reading this I\'d just shake my head and think, ""That\'s just way too young.""(2) ""The label came to me with a concept for the \'… Baby One More Time\' video in which I would play a futuristic astronaut. The mock-up I saw had me looking like a Power Ranger. That image didn\'t resonate with me, and I had a feeling my audience wouldn\'t relate to it, either.""- That sounds an awful lot like the ""Oops ... I Did it Again"" video, which is ironic given the title.- Seems like the label got their way in the end, possibly to recoup development costs.(3) ""The director for the [""... Baby One More Time""] video, Nigel Dick, was open to my ideas. In addition to the school bell cuing the start of the dancing, I added that it was important that there be cute boys.""- Whew! Glad she said ""boys"" there. You know, given her inclination toward older guys.(4) ""In the pop dance world, there are two camps. Most people will say that LA dancers are better. No disrespect to them, but my spirit has always liked New York dancers best—they have more heart.""- Hmm, I wonder if the dance wars are anything like the East Coast/West Coast rap wars? I envision more twirling.(5) Britney went on a twenty-six mall tour to promote her debut single.- Wow! That\'s so very \'90s. You\'d be lucky to find many malls still around and operational these days.(6) We learn that Britney\'s real hair color is black.- Exactly how long has she been dying her hair? That much bleach can\'t be good for your health.- The darkest I\'ve ever seen her hair was light brown.(7) The whole period covering her early success is really glossed over quickly. Sucks for me, because this is the time of her life and career that I\'m most interested in.- Though, I can sort of understand since it\'s only the space of a few years. And additionally, years with Justin she probably wants to put behind her.- I guess it\'s not really a departure from the rest of the book. She doesn\'t so much tell stories as she drops a lot of quick anecdotes. This book never really dwells on anything for too long.- Possibly, it\'s meant to convey how much of a whirlwind this period was.(8) ""Was I mad at being \'outed\' by [Justin] as sexually active? No. To be honest with you, I liked that Justin said that. Why did my managers work so hard to claim I was some kind of young-girl virgin even into my twenties? Whose business was it if I’d had sex or not?""- Well, at least she addressed the virginity thing. Reading about her less-than-virginal youth, I thought I\'d imagined it.- I must correct myself from earlier. She lost her virginity at 14, not 13. My math didn\'t add right.(9) Probably the biggest revelation to come from this memoir is that Justin made Britney have an abortion.- Which, the way she describes it, sounds more like she wanted to keep it but acceded to his wishes because she thought he was smarter than her.(10) Justin breaks up with Britney over text. Later on he visits her and gives her a framed letter that he wrote.- I don\'t know what\'s more bizarre, framing a letter before you give it to someone, or the fact that Britney still keeps it under her bed.(11) It sort of makes sense how Britney would turn a blind eye to Justin\'s infidelity and emotional abuse. She writes that his family was more family to her than her own.- Boy, Britney really throws Jamie-Lynn Spears under the bus. Calls her a ""bitch""anda ""witch.""(12) ""\'We have to get this annulled,\' [my parents] said. They made way too big of a deal out of innocent fun.""- I wouldn\'t exactly describe drunkenly marrying your childhood friend as ""innocent fun."" I\'d have to side with her wicked parents on this one.- You know, even though it\'s not mentioned here, I still remember her short-lived husband\'s name was Jason Alexander. I remember thinking at the time, ""Britney Spears married the guy fromSeinfeld?""01/20/2024- Chapters 18–25(1) ""[Kevin Federline] was getting ready to shoot the cover for his album. He was in the studio all the time. He really thought he was a rapper now. Bless his heart—because he did take it so seriously.""- LOL! Britney low-key trashing K-Fed\'s rap career is so far the best thing about this book!- The ""bless his heart"" really twists the knife.(2) ""Kevin had a \'bad boy\' image. Still, I had no idea when we met that he had a toddler, nor that his ex-girlfriend was eight months pregnant with his second baby. I was clueless ... had no idea until after we’d been together for a while and someone told me, \'You know he has a new baby, right?\'""- I don\'t know about this supposed ""bad boy"" image. I seem to remember everyone treating him like a joke and a poser. Besides, I can\'t really think of any other ""bad boy"" dancers.- I can understand the whole baby-daddy conversation not exactly being first-date material, but c\'mon. Don\'t leave it to the point where other people have to bring it up.- Maybe she\'s mistaking ""bad boy"" for ""bad guy""?- It\'s interesting how through the whole Kevin Federline section, Britney never says how they met or even mentions that he was one of her backup dancers. If you knew absolutely nothing, you\'d read this book and think he was a fellow musician.(3) ""The Onyx Hotel Tour was just rough. It was too sexual, for a start. Justin had embarrassed me publicly, so my rebuttal onstage was to kind of go there a little bit, too. But it was absolutely horrible. I hated it in the moment.""- These celebrities and their musical revenge tours! Not every public drama has to be given expression through song and dance.- Finally, Britney thinking something is ""toosexual."" I was beginning to worry she had no personal boundaries.(4) ""We would hire an amazing chef—too expensive to use very often. But one time, eating something the chef cooked, I said, \'Oh my God, this is the most delicious thing I’ve ever had and can you just live with us? I love you so much!\' And I meant it—Ilovedhim.""- That\'s the problem with Britney, she falls in love too easily. With Federline, it was just cuddling in a pool.- Must be some chef! One of the wealthiest women in the world, and this guy is a special occasion meal.(5) ""I could smell the weed wafting out of the studio door before I even walked in. [Kevin] and the other guys would all be getting high, and it felt like I was in the way. I wasn’t invited to their party.""- One thing Britney definitely hates is the smell of weed. She mentions it several times. Real mystery, then, why she would propose to a pothead.- Interesting thing to bother a life-long smoker. I guess you just get used to your own smells.(6) ""People say he’s going to break up with me while I have tiny children, like he did with the mother of his first two children when they were infants, but no way! How he was with his other family won’t be the way he is with me.""- Yeah, Britney would do well to start listening to people.- Though, technicallyshebroke up withhim... but only because he was about to break up with her and she didn\'t want to be dumped.(7) ""One time he came home late and told me he’d been at a party. \'Justin Timberlake was there!\' he said. \'Lindsay Lohan was, too!\'""- Britney goes on and on about how clueless she can be. I tell you, she\'s got nothing on Federline... name-dropping Justin Timberlake to Britney Spears!(8) ""Looking back, I think that both Justin and Kevin were very clever. They knew what they were doing, and I played right into it.""- This is a pretty vague statement. Though, the implication I\'m getting is that both Justin and Kevin got with Britney in order to launch their solo music careers. Also, they knew she was too shy and submissive to push back on their bad behavior.- I don\'t know if I\'m entirely on board with that. It\'s extremely cynical, thinking of them both as kind of gold-diggers. Though, would Justin Timberlake be as big a star if he hadn\'t dated Britney? Certainly, no one would even know who Kevin Federline is.(9) ""I went into a hair salon, and I took the clippers, and I shaved off all my hair. Everyone thought it was hilarious.Look how crazy she is!Even my parents acted embarrassed by me. But nobody seemed to understand that I was simply out of my mind with grief.""- I can understand the whole idea of giving the press the middle-finger by taking away the ""Britney"" they knew and expected, but I don\'t know if the public took it the same way.- Frankly, theonlyconclusion would be that she\'d gone crazy, which she pretty much admits here.- I may be naïve, but if you\'re shaving your head, why would you need to go to a hair salon?- Bold and rebellious perhaps, but it doesn\'t help when you\'re fighting for custody of your kids and K-Fed\'s been insisting you\'re a bad mother.(10) ""The interior designer was completely against it. He said, \'Marble floors are super slippery and hard if you fall down.\'\'I want marble!\' I shouted. \'Ineedmarble.\'""- Britney does a good deal of apologizing to people in this book, mostly for erratic behavior during the time she was seemingly permanently pregnant and high on hormones. Contractors, in this case.(11) Speaking of which, she apologizes to her sister\'s co-star for going on set and chewing her out for starting rumors about Jamie Lynn. Turns out she was innocent.- Jamie Lynn Spears comes off terribly in this book! She\'s one of the villains: Justin\'s a philanderer, Kevin\'s a weed-addict and Jamie Lynn\'s a rich bitch.*character limitClick here for the rest'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'It’s hard to rate a heartfelt memoir that is basically a long-repressed confession and an attempt to come to grasp what the hell actually happened to life. You can’t help but feel that in judging the book you’re judging the person behind it, the person who just poured her soul out in a very vulnerable and a bit messy way.So, instead of judging I’d rather give a big warm hug and a reassurance that yes, Britney, I think you’ve finally been seen how you want to be seen.“Thirteen years went by with me feeling like a shadow of myself. I think back now on my father and his associates having control over my body and my money for that long and it makes me feel sick.Think of how many male artists gambled all their money away; how many had substance abuse or mental health issues. No one tried to take away their control over their body and money. I didn’t deserve what my family did to me.”I remember that in my adolescence and young adulthood Britney Spears seemed to be everywhere - or at least everywhere where the attention of a teenage girl went, ever since “…Baby One More Time” catchy lyrics and equally catchy video made me stare at the TV in my living room in fascination when I was 15. TV, glossy magazines, radio — and not just the music but relentless gossip, scrutiny, speculations, gleeful schadenfreude whenever there was any real or perceived blunder, and vitriolic mocking delight when something went wrong with the Princess of Pop.We love to build them up but we equally love to tear them down, I suppose.“That’s the thing about this industry. I never knew how to play the game. I didn’t know how to present myself on any level. […] I can see now that you have to be smart enough, vicious enough, deliberate enough to play the game, and I did not know the game. I was truly innocent—just clueless. […]So I was young, and I made a lot of mistakes. But I will say this: I wasn’t manipulative. I was just stupid.”Here, however, Britney Spears, having lived through 13 years of absolutely ridiculous conservatorship (when she was well enough to earn millions but legally not well enough to spend them, or do most things an adult independent woman would take for granted - like determine her contraception or use her phone when she wanted to, or choose to say “no”) shows what was going on behind the glitz and sparkles and occasional denim-on-denim outfit. What comes through in a still very young-sounding voice is a sensitive person who’s conditioned to be sweet and nice, and often a bit confused, and quite lonely, who spent a long time learning how to be intimidated and even be angry politely, and strangely over-reliant on her family even as an adult despite emotional abuse — and whose natural development seems to be artificially stunted somewhat by the unnatural cage she ended up in — in a true medieval fashion made to be a property of her father.“The woman in me was pushed down for a long time. They wanted me to be wild onstage, the way they told me to be, and to be a robot the rest of the time. I felt like I was being deprived of those good secrets of life—those fundamental supposed sins of indulgence and adventure that make us human. They wanted to take away that specialness and keep everything as rote as possible. It was death to my creativity as an artist.”She’s not going to win any writing awards any time soon, but that’s not the point of her story. Where she succeeds is at the emotional level, just so plainly wanting to be heard and give us *her* view of her own story. What you’re left with is the admiration that she wasn’t fully broken, that she is out free to live her life and make her choices, and choose to be carefree and reckless if she wants, or just enjoy the quiet peace if she so chooses. But she can choose it for herself, without ending up someone else’s property.Maybe she’ll make choices others disagree with or judge, but she has the freedom to make them — the freedom that should have never been taken away from her in the first place.“I’d been taught through the conservatorship to feel almost too fragile, too scared. That’s the price I paid under the conservatorship. They took a lot of my womanhood, my sword, my core, my voice, the ability to say “Fuck you.” And I know that sounds bad, but there is something crucial about this. Don’t underestimate your power.”And it’s still so polite, this book. Still reserved and sweet at the times where I’d expect anyone to start screaming in bloody rage at the world. And I’m not sure if that’s just a careful editorial decision or Britney’s personality, but in any way it’s striking. And perhaps says more by its restraint than it would have done otherwise. Because her conservatorship was mindlessly cruel and ridiculous, and I am horrified at the thought that others may be in the same situation but without Britney’s means to get out, broken without much hope.“I sometimes thought that it was almost funny how I won those awards for the album I made while I was supposedly so incapacitated that I had to be controlled by my family.The truth was, though, when I stopped to think about it for very long, it wasn’t funny at all.”4 stars and a hug. I’m judging it on its own separate scale since it managed to hit me right in the feels.“Shaving my head was a way of saying to the world: Fuck you. You want me to be pretty for you? Fuck you. You want me to be good for you? Fuck you. You want me to be your dream girl? Fuck you. I’d been the good girl for years. I’d smiled politely while TV show hosts leered at my breasts, while American parents said I was destroying their children by wearing a crop top, while executives patted my hand condescendingly and second-guessed my career choices even though I’d sold millions of records, while my family acted like I was evil. And I was tired of it.”——————Also posted onmy blog.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'From scrolling through the reviews, it seems as though everyone is just review-bombing without reading.

You could do anything right now. I’d still love you with unconditional love.”pg. 23Although The Woman in Me does not explain everything, it gives context to a lot of the situations that the media focused on throughout the 2000s, including her relationship with Justin Timberlake, the shaved head/hitting a paparazzi car with an umbrella incident (which I don\'t think anyone willeverforget), and her marriage to Kevin Federline. Most importantly, she discussed her experience with the conservatorship, which as we know was perpetrated by her dad, Jamie Spears, for 13 years! It was heartbreaking to read about the enablers of the conservatorship, including her mom, Lynne Spears, and how much everyone, including the court system, misled and took advantage of her during these years. She is so brave for making the final 911 call which ultimately led to the end of the conservatorship.Wendy Williams said it best...“Why was it so easy for everyone to forget that I was a human being—vulnerable enough that these headlines could leave a bruise?”pg. 100The memoir felt more authentic than I anticipated, even though she worked with ghostwriters (like most celebrities do when writing memoirs), which pleasantly surprised me! I personally have fallen down the rabbit hole of Britney Spears conspiracy theories multiple times in the past few years, and I am not sure if this memoir convinced me that she is 100% safe. I was hoping she would talk about her marriage with Hesam Asghari, and their ""wedding"" (If you know, you know. If you don\'t, look it up on TikTok LOL), but from the sections where he is mentioned, it seems like she wrote this when they were still together.Overall, it was a really enjoyable read, I would recommend it not only to fans of Britney Spears and celebrity memoirs but to anyone looking to pick up a quick read because Britney deserves for her truth to be heard.#FreeBritney'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""This is a generous 3 Stars..The writing... honestly painful at times.

There were sixty kids in my small-town graduating class. We were all ""celebrities"" in our own way. We gossiped about each other, spread rumors, knew every intimate detail. I still remember who lost their virginity to who, at least according to legend. Now I realize half the stuff we said about each other couldn\'t possibly be true. But rumors, especially the salacious ones, stick around.I\'d always loved Britney\'s music, but it was her tabloid scandal era when I connected to her personally. Maybe because I had my own weekly barrage of lies to fend off. Mostly the other kids said I was a faggot. That didn\'t bother me because it was true. When I didn\'t cry, my tormentors invented new things to say. Most of it so ridiculous and obscene I just laughed it off.A lot has been said about Britney Spears. Intuitively, most of us realize the rumors must be far from the truth. Likely that’s why her book is such a bestseller. What is the real story behind the iconic photographs, front-page break-ups and altered stage presence? What\'s the deal with her family?This book doesn\'t answer every question, but it does provide context for major events that even non-fans will remember: What (if anything) did Britney do to Justin? Why did she shave her head and attack paparazzi with an umbrella? What was going through her mind during the infamous ""Gimme More"" VMA performance? Why did she cancel her successful Vegas residency?Britney’s explanations range from in-depth to predictably vague. At times she seems to be a revisionist, such as when she explains that the “Gimme More” music video appears low-budget because it was casually filmed with friends while they popped in and out of bars. In actuality, the video was directed by Jake Sarfaty and shot in a warehouse—or at least that was previously considered a fact. Either way, she shouldn’t apologize. It’s a great video.I do think trauma perhaps misconstrued some of her memories. Like when she writes she didn’t mind Justin bragging about banging her, because it allowed her to “come out” as a non-virgin. It’s hard for me to imagine her being totally okay with what he said. My basis for thinking this is from personal experience.Previously I wrote that I didn’t mind being called homophobic slurs and could “laugh off” repulsive rumors. Almost certainly that’s not true. I’m sure I was destroyed, but over time my mind has altered these memories for my own benefit. Reliving trauma can be as deadly as heart disease. To fix this, the mind might reshape memories to mend the injury, like putting a scab over a wound. I’m not a doctor, but that’s how it feels to me.Of course not all wounds are easy to heal. Britney’s memoirs grow particularly dark when she gets into the conservatorship. This section receives the most pages and feels like the part she wrote on her own, with the least help from editors and ghostwriters. It’s heartbreaking to read, even after being familiar with her legal testimony.You don’t have to be a global superstar to learn from Britney that family can be dangerous. The people who are supposed to love you unconditionally are also the ones who can be the most evil, the most controlling, and the worst for mental health. And it’s always so obvious to outsiders. Of course Britney’s family only care about the money. It’s even tempting to blame Britney herself for staying in that situation as long as she did.But when it’s you—your family who’s gaslighting and manipulating—you put up with the abuse. You don’t even see it. You wait for them to change—because of the happy memories, or out of blind devotion. Because That’s What Family Is For, or some bullshit.I say ‘you’ but I really mean me. No, I don’t have money, so my family isn’t interested in that, but they are obsessed with changing me—trying to mold me into whatever straight religious Frankenstein monster of a creation they have in mind. In the animal kingdom, it seems cruel when mama birds push their babies out of the nest. Now I wonder if that’s a major evolutionary advantage. At a certain point, parents turn rancid. It’s best to fly away as fast as you can.Overall, this book was emotional, a little triggering, and perhaps unnecessary. I will always love Britney because her music and personal strength got me through my own tough times, but I also understand that she is a product of pop culture and we may never truly understand what it’s like to be her.In the copyright section, there is this puzzling note: ""The right of Britney Jean Spears to be identified as the author of this work has been asserted in accordance with the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act, 1988.” This is not the kind of note that assures readers Britney herself was the sole author of this book. That’s not to say another writer can’t articulate her feelings, and I’m sure she signed off on everything, but this is far from the “tell-all” big reveal fans, psychologists and pop culture fanatics have been dreaming of.Of course it’s hard to tell all when you’re still processing years of abuse. Also, things change. The book must have been finalized some months back, since it ends on the pleasant note of implied martial success with Sam Asghari. They officially divorced back in August.I think the rosy Sam sections were probably what Britney had in mind when she thought it would be “too hard” to read the audiobook herself. Fortunately Michelle Williams put in a stellar performance that not only breathes life into the text, but mimics Britney’s tonal quality so that it’s easy to imagine it’s her.WhileThe Woman in Medoesn’t always live up to the hype, it is still a must-read case study of American stardom and the dangers of relationships that anyone can find themselves in, to one degree or another.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Insights Behind the HeadlinesKudos to Britney Spears for speaking publicly about her conservatorship!This is the second book this year where I have read about guardians gone wrong. In Astor: The Rise and Fall of an American Fortune by Anderson Cooper, Brooke Astor had a very difficult time in her later years. Her son, Tony Marshall, was accused of allowing her to live in squalor and reduced necessary medications.Luckily, Ms. Astor (who was worth an estimated $192 million upon her death) had some friends in very high places. Her grandsons teamed up with Annette de la Renta, billionaire David Rockefeller, and Henry Kissinger. The very next day after filing the affidavits, the judge signed guardianship over to Annette de la Renta and JP Morgan Chase guardian over her assets.Why in the world was Britney’s father put in charge of her assets? How in the world is he qualified? JP Morgan Chase or an alcoholic with a history of bankruptcy?The Woman In Me is an interesting behind-the-scenes view of the major events of Britney’s life, primarily focusing on Britney’s conservatorship.Although the book is riveting, the book felt a bit high-level, and it felt like some things were missing.For example, Britney is locked up in a rehab facility for months at a time against her will. Presumably, Britney was dating Sam Asghari at this point.Personally, I trust approximately four people in my life, but these four people would do literally anything to help me. If I was Britney, I would be desperately trying to get in contact with Sam Asghari. However, she never talks about whether she attempted to reach Sam during her time in confinement.It seems to me that Britney Spears is one of the loneliest people in the world. Any time she meets anyone, she must think, “Does this person like me because they like me or is this person trying to be nice to me for money?” Her family should have been the one group of people that she could rely on, but even they turned on her.

That being said, I am not an undying Britney stan who will ignore all the problematic behaviors she exhibits, simply because of who she is. If her IG wasn't proof enough of her instability, this book does her absolutely no favors. The writing comes off as disjointed, almost manic at times--the naïve, childlike, angry ramblings of someone with no insight into her behavior. It does very little to counter the claims of her mental instability and inability to govern herself.For example, she admits to using Adderall and OTC caffeine/energy supplements, and with the way she rambles in her own writing, it doesn't take much to believe that she did indeed abuse them, which is what she says her doctors and her father was accusing her of multiple times in the book. Her own thought process in the book just makes her come across as a speed freak in denial. It's also very clear that she has the mentality of a child. There's a part in the book where she says she went through a battery of cognitive testing and was told by her father that she failed, and I don't doubt that was true and not just something that her father said to her. With the way she presents her thoughts in this book and the level of naïveté that comes across, you end up wondering if there is some sort of intellectual deficiency going on, or if it's just an extreme failure in her education, due to working in the entertainment business since she was a child and likely nobody prioritizing that for her. Either way, it's very clear that she doesn't possess the thought processes one would expect of someone her age.To be clear, I believe that assertion that she makes in this book that the conservatorship was about money and control by her family. That fact is very clear. There were egregious abuses committed against her by the people involved. That being said, it is also very clear that she is extremely mentally ill, and I can very easily see how she could've been kept in that situation for so long because she displays no insight into her own problematic behaviors, and she does not present the way a sane 40 year old adult should.I honestly think she is permanently broken, and I'm sad for her and especially for her kids. I don't think she's particularly interested in getting help, because I don't think she thinks there's anything wrong with her; which, is her prerogative now, I guess. At the very least, I hope she finds some semblance of peace and happiness.At the end of the day, this book wasn't worth the read. While I wasn't expecting award-winning writing, I find it hard to believe that she wrote this book by herself, and I have no idea why the ghost writers, the editors, and her lawyers didn't do a better job cleaning up this book and at least helping her to present her side of the story in a way that doesn't end up making you wonder if the conservatorship was justified and is, in someways, maybe still needed--albeit, without her family's involvement.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""4 StarsTo be clear, this rating is not a review or judgment of Britney’s life, struggles, or journey. It’s just a reflection on how much I enjoyed the book as a reading experience.I am almost the same exact age as Britney, so I feel like we grew up together. I was very much a fan of her, NSYNC, Christina Aguilera, Backstreet...basically ALL the chart topping pop performers and bands of that time and genre (among others too, mind you). I remember having so much teenage envy for her life and her romance with Justin Timberlake.Obviously we all watched from the outside as her life has unfolded since that time, whatever our perceptions.This book reminded me that fame and fortune are not all they are cracked up to be. Britney has been treated like a cash register show pony for so many years of her life. Like a commodity of the world. The way she was targeted and treated by the media was virtually criminal.Shame on the paparazzi.Shame on people like Diane Sawyer.Shame on all of us for creating the demand that prompted this treatment of another human being.Who knows what the truth of anything really is...but this book is Britney's perception of her life and the ways things played out. And based on this book and just watching her story in the media for many years, it definitely seems like Britney has never (or at least not for many years) really had anyone in her life who wasn't there for ulterior motives. And that makes me sad for her.I'm really happy she finally got to tell her story. I hope she finds happiness.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Moved to tears.Poor Britney! Her highly anticipated memoir expertly read by actress Michelle Williams provides her fans with an insight into her sheltered world. Britney details her desire to make it big so she can escape poverty and an abusive household. As the daughter of a controlling alcoholic father, she longed for fame and fortune. Once she made it big, her family took advantage of her generosity instead of recognizing her loneliness, depression, and sadness.After her infamous violent outburst where she shaved her head and attacked paparazzi, her father placed her in a conservatorship for thirteen years. During this time, all aspects of her life were strictly dictated by him, while he reaped the profits. The book highlights how she was brutally exploited for thirteen years and her consequent struggle to gain autonomy.Britney does spill a few secrets, but the main takeaway from this book is that fame comes with a price and if you see something, say something.While I found myself sobbing over the sad story of such a beloved superstar, I question why she does not mention being diagnosed with a mental illness as it has been widely reported. Is this true? Is she hiding more secrets? Probably.Regardless, the book is well-written, contains emotional depth, and the audiobook is superb. Chef’s kiss to Michelle Williams!Congratulations to Britney for all her achievements in the music industry as well as in her personal life.

I grew up listening to Britney and owned a few of her CD\'s that I would keep on replay. Unfortunately, as I grew older, I didn\'t keep up with her life. I remember hearing things here and there about some of her lowest points as portrayed by the media, but it wasn\'t until I began learning more about the conservatorship that I realized the amount of trauma she experienced. The amount of neglect and abuse experienced at the hands of her family, the media, and Justin just blew me away. Her story and legacy is the perfect example of ""you never know what someone is going through."" While she was getting taunted by the media and portrayed as the ""harlot"" that broke Justin\'s heart, Britney, in my opinion, was literally searching for an ideal situation or environment where she would not only be able to make decisions for herself, but thrive as a healthy adult. Coming from a family that showed no remorse in using her for personal gain, it does not surprise me that she sought comfort in situations that weren\'t always that great. It explains why she took the break up with Justin so hard and continued to protect him after he single-handedly launched his solo career while dragging her through the pits of hell to the media and anyone else that would listen. After reading this book, it amazes me that Britney has such determination to be such a kind and peaceful person. While some may look at this as a betrayal to Justin and her family, I find it empowering to know that she had the courage and willpower to share some of the most intimate moments of life while revealing the true nature of all parties involved. This book isn\'t about them or some immaculate revenge plot. It\'s Britney\'s space to work through and illustrate how the industry, her family, friends, and partners changed her into the person that she is now. It\'s the opportunity to create questions about what could have been had she just had one ounce of support from those closest to her. It must have been such a painful experience to draft the many ways in which so many people failed you as a person. But it must have given her so much pride to see how she pushed and fought to have her voice heard. I\'m not sure if she knew that her book was going to garner such a positive response, but good for her. As I always say, it\'s not our job to dictate when someone should share their story. I don\'t care if it\'s a long after the fact. It\'s not fair to tell a victim how to process and heal.Overall, I found this read to be both compelling and heartbreaking. Britney isn\'t the greatest writer, but it feels like an honor to be able to read what seems like a such a personal, intimate recollection of events. I hope that she continues to find peace and remain in it.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Don’t miss my article on medium.com :https://medium.com/@niluferyozmekik/t...What did I feel after reading the last words of this memoir? I felt the importance of liberating your potential by truly discovering who you are! But I\'m also truly angered by how cruel and manipulative a family can be to exploit the talents of a woman, trying to steal her money, her possessions, her freedom, and finally her soul—demanding a piece of her in the worst way than paparazzi did to earn their wage. This is a stunning, highly thought-provoking must-read and the most alluring, argumentative memoir of the year! The winner is ""It\'s Britney, bitch.""“In the Bible, it says your tongue is your sword. My tongue and my sword were me singing. My whole childhood, I sang. I sang along with the car radio on the way to dance class. I sang when I was sad. To me, singing was spiritual.”That book made me ache, cry, scream in frustration, awe, resent, piss off, smile, and finally filled with empathy for a unique, unusual, eccentric talented woman who has been randomly bullied by the media. She was shunned, shamed, and criticized by people who have no idea about her life. She experienced slut and body shaming when she was only a teenager, asked if her breasts were real instead of acknowledging the musical achievements she succeeded in at a young age.“Artists make things and play characters because they want an escape into faraway worlds, and escape was exactly what I needed. I wanted to live inside my dreams, my wonderful fictitious world, and never think about reality if I could help it. Singing bridged reality and fantasy, the world I was living in and the world that I desperately wanted to inhabit.”She is coming from a very dysfunctional family which the people who never learn the meaning of love and respect in contrast showing their feelings in abuse and most distorted ways of dysfunctionality.“…my grandfather June Spears Sr.-was abusive. Jean suffered the loss of a baby when he was only three days old. June sent Jean to Southeast Louisiana Hospital, a by-all-accounts horrible asylum in Mandeville, where she was put on lithium. In 1966, when she was thirty-one, my grandmother Jean shot herself with a shotgun on her infant son\'s grave, just over eight years after his death. I can\'t imagine the grief that she must have felt.”She worked so hard to pursue her dreams without knowing the meaning of misogyny, mansplaining in big boys’ world without having a tactic to play the right game. She just wanted to perform and shine!“I signed my name with a heart. I liked looking cute. Why did everyone treat me, even when I was a teenager, like I was dangerous?”This was in contrast to her opposite-sex peers who became rising stars from the Mickey Mouse Club, gaslighting the fans with crocodile tears they shed after a wrongly reflected breakup story.“Abortion was something I never could have imagined choosing for myself, but given the circumstances, that is what we didI don\'t know if that was the right decision. If it had been left up to me alone, I never would have done it. And yet Justin was so sure that he didn\'t want to be a father“…. When I tell you it was painful-I can\'t begin to describe it. The pain was unbelievable. I went down to the ground on my knees, holding the toilet. For a long time, I couldn\'t move. To this day, it\'s one of the most agonizing things I have ever experienced in my life.”Britney is a dancer, singer, performer, mother, depressed, troubled, manipulated, captivated, institutionalized, but still, she’s a woman, a crying soul who wants to please the people she loves, and her only intention is to be loved in return.This book tells the heart-wrenching story of a little Louisiana girl who loved white marbles, felt protected by her faith in God, loved the spotlight, used her dancing and singing skills to shine bright, and turned into a young woman burdened with responsibilities at a young age.She never experienced a proper childhood with a drunk father and an argumentative mother who granted her enough freedom to drive a car at the age of thirteen. Even though she was underage, she purchased them a house, an act that displayed financial responsibility beyond her years. However, her family later chose to strip away her rights, coercing her into obedience—a child who had generated enough wealth to turn them into multimillionaires. This is the story of a girl who never had the chance to explore becoming a real woman, manipulated not only by her own family but also by the men in her life: a first love who compelled her to undergo an abortion in their shared house, leaving her bleeding on the bathroom floor, and a husband who was enamored with the seductive allure of fame and power, ultimately taking custody of their two children and betraying her trust in the most egregious ways.For years, she was marketed as the girl next door, the young virgin, the teenage beauty, subjecting her to immense pressure and resulting in psychotic breaks, compounded by additional postpartum depression.“With my head shaved, everyone was scared of me, even my mom. No one would talk to me anymore because I was too ugly.My long hair was a big part of what people liked -I knew that. I knew a lot of guys thought long hair was hot.Shaving my head was a way of saying to the world: Fuck you. You want me to be pretty for you? Fuck you. You want me to be good for you? Fuck you. You want me to be your dream girl? Fuck you.”For years, from her Instagram videos to her creepy, awkward fashion style choices, or, let me say, most naked choreographies she performed on social media, adding blades to her dance, which alarmed most of us, made me roll my eyes and say to myself: what the heck is this woman trying to do. But when I read this book, I truly understood and empathized with the main reason for her peculiar behavior.She’s performing whatever she likes because, after thirteen years of family prison—conservatorship—that put her life on pause to live for others, she has every right to be unleashed and liberate herself in whatever condition she chooses.“From all those years making myself do what I was told and being treated in a certain way, I\'ve come to see what kind of people I want to be around and what kind of people I don\'t. So much of the media was cruel to me, and that hasn\'t changed just because I am out of the conservatorship. There\'s been a lot of speculation about how I\'m doing. I know my fans care. I am free now. I\'m just being myself and trying to heal. I finally get to do what I want, when I want. And I don\'t take a minute of it for granted.”She earned it. You may find it weird, unusual, but this is how she expresses herself. Thankfully, things started to change, and mental health awareness became a more crucial element in our lives, even though the increasing amount of cyberbullying, slut-body shaming still haunts people\'s lives on social media.When we read the life story of Britney written in a genuine tone, we learn to understand that for years, most of us have not been fair with our judgments about her.Freedom means being goofy, silly, and having fun on social media. Freedom means taking a break from Instagram without people calling 911. Freedom means being able to make mistakes, and learning from them. Freedom means I don\'t have to perform for anyone-onstage or offstage. Freedom means that I get to be as beautifully imperfect as everyone else. And freedom means the ability, and the right, to search for joy, in my own way, on my own terms.She’s been framed, turned into a slave, and for years nobody extended a hand to take her out of her dark corner. That’s the most painful part of her story. When she couldn’t find enough love and support from her own family, including her mother and her sister—who already wrote their own biographies before her to emphasize how hard it is to live a life with her, even though she already left them behind and they still accommodate to the houses she’s bought for them—she decided to trust her fans’ devotion and the God who gave her patience to get through this compelling process.“It took a long time and a lot of work for me to feel ready to tell my story. I hope it inspires people on some level and can touch hearts. Since I\'ve been free, I\'ve had to construct a whole different identity. I\'ve had to say, wait a second, this is who I was-someone passive and pleasing. A girl. And this is who I am now-someone strong and confident. A woman.”“Woman in Me” unveils not only the struggles of an iconic pop star but also the broader societal issues surrounding mental health, autonomy, and the exploitation of celebrities. Britney Spears\' journey, as narrated in this memoir, serves as a stark reminder of the importance of empathy and understanding beyond the glitz and glamour of fame.As we close the chapters of this gripping memoir, it prompts us to reflect on the collective responsibility we hold as a society to protect and uplift those who entertain us, rather than succumb to the allure of sensationalism and tabloid narratives. The resilience and determination Britney exhibited in breaking free from the chains of conservatorship inspire us to advocate for justice, compassion, and the basic human right to live one\'s life on one\'s terms.A note: If there were Oscars for the best book narration category, Michelle Williams would undoubtedly receive high accolades for her extraordinary talent. She lent her voice to Britney\'s traumatic yet compelling, and ultimately inspirational and empowering life story. Williams adeptly conveyed the restrained emotions simmering beneath the surface, demonstrating both sensitivity and balanced objectivism.

I am in fact a conservator myself, I take care of a disabled veteran - pay his bills, make decisions about his healthcare, stuff like that. I also talk to him on the phone most days and during Covid I would pick up cigarettes for him and other stuff he needed but could not have delivered otherwise. He has no family and we have a connection as veterans and I really don’t mind helping him. And I do not make that much money for the work and time spent as his conservator.When all the conservatorship issues with Britney came up there was also a film that came out about the same time, I Care A Lot, and many of us who practice in this area met with our judge and we discussed all of these issues. In my state someone can be disabled but still not need a conservator, I think this is true in most jurisdictions. Laws are set up to prevent someone from being taking advantage of and / or lost in the system. I recall our judge, who I greatly admire and respect, saying something to the effect of “can you even imagine this happening in this courtroom?” While the film shed light on abuses that could possibly happen, it was mostly wild fiction.The Britney Spears case, though, was bizarre. Folks who become wards of the court and whose lives are controlled by a conservator are usually very low functioning. They might have a part-time job at the grocery store or sweeping up at a family owned business. Most don’t work at all, cannot sustain employment in any fashion. How could she perform the way she did and still need a conservator? How could she dance and sing, with all the hours and hours of practice and choreography required, and appear on TV shows and meet fans and the public, and need a conservator? Another attorney and I looked at each other and decided we knew what the answer must be:California.I am very much a proponent of Justice Brandies’ famous adage about laboratories of democracy, advocating for a robust federal system where different states can have divergent procedural and even substantive laws concerning a great many areas of law. If the voters in California want those kinds of laws for conservators that’s their business.But damn.Anyway, this was entertaining but also maddening and depressing and lots of it was just sad. According to Britney, her parents were terrible, basically taking over her life for years. Many articles available online tell a different version of events, saying the conservatorship saved her life. Life can be complicated, there is much greater nuance to most things than what headlines tell us. I do find it noteworthy that while Britney supposedly needed a conservatorship, lived under the draconian rule of her over-controlling father, she did hundreds of shows and made lots of people millions of dollars, including this same father.This was written in a very informal, conversational style, easy to read and for the most part a good book. I also believe that, like many autobiographies, there was a lot that was left out. Even considering the gross misapplication of justice that took place for Britney, she glossed over much of the evidence against her. To be fair, she conceded a great deal as well. While this was never quite a torrid and steamy tell all, her relationship with Justin Timberlake and Kevin Federline and other celebrities does get some page time and we get to know some behind the scenes stories that were intriguing. We also get to know Britney the mother and her love for her sons was genuine and her pain at losing so much time with them was sincere.'}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""Source of book: Bought by meeeRelevant disclaimers: NonePlease note: This review may not be reproduced or quoted, in whole or in part, without explicit consent from the author.And remember: I am not here to judge your drag, I mean your book. Books are art and art is subjective. These are just my personal thoughts. They are not meant to be taken as broader commentary on the general quality of the work. Believe me, I have not enjoyed many an excellent book, and my individual lack of enjoyment has not made any of those books less excellent or (more relevantly) less successful.*******************************************I have no idea how to talk meaningfully about this.I mean, I’m a fan of Britney Spears, in the way I’m a fan of most of the things I like, which is to say I’m invested in the art, and don’t consider the person who created it to be my business (although, of course, that’s slightly more complicated when you’re talking about music which is not so easily extricable from the performer unlike, you know, art or books or whatever). What makes this extra disorientating as far as Britney is concerned is that—as far as I can tell—her life was very much treated as everybody’s business in ways it absolutely shouldn’t for literally years. In the end, though, I felt I kind of, I don’t know, almost like I … owed her (insofar as one can owe anything to a public figure) to read her own damn words? Pay her money that would actually belong to and be used by her. Rather than just listening to her music and trying to ignore the abuses that have been heaped on this one woman artistically, culturally, legally and at the hands of her own family for almost her entire life.It's a fairly short read, though not exactly an easy one. And while there’s a few juicy and/or agonising anecdotes in there (all of which are already highly publicised—Britney’s bathroom floor abortion, Timberlake’s fo shiz, Jamie Spears’ “I’m Britney Spears now”) assuming you’re even passingly familiar with the life and work of Britney Spears, it’s not going to tell you anything you don’t already know or have already guessed. What is important about it—and what, honestly, I found quite moving—is that it comes across like the first thing that has existed in the public domain (bar a collection of highly quirky and specific Instagram posts) that feels true Britney herself.Or rather true to whatever sense of Britney Spears as a person I have semi-parasocially constructed in my head based on the inescapable nature of the publicly available information about her and bog-standard human empathy.And, of course, the book is the work of a ghost writer. But whoever they are (and Britney does thank them obliquely in the book itself) they’ve done, as far as I’m concerned, a really impressive job. It feels like Britney trusted them. And as a consequence, the book is engagingly written, doesn’t overstay its welcome, and captures something—to use another complicated word—authentic? There’s a simmering anger here, understandably, but also the same soft-spoken gentleness familiar from the spoken interviews Britney has conducted over the years (sometimes with extraordinarily hostile interviewers). She speaks (writes? One of the strengths of the book is that it really does come across as Britney sharing her thoughts unmediated) with clarity and certainty, and without self-pity or pretension, about the various double-standards, cruelties and injustices that have shaped her life. It’s harrowing and infuriating and painful. It’s, frankly, astonishing she survived it.I also kind of got the sense, rightly or wrongly, that Britney didn’t actually want to dwell on any of this; the problem is her life is just a cavalcade of it. I mean not, don’t get me wrong, necessarily moreso than anyone else’s: then again, I can’t think of many people who’ve had the entirety of a sportsball stadium boo them for breaking up with a boy. She does, however, go out of her way to offer us glimpses of happier moments: her collaboration with Madonna, Mariah Carey’s LIGHT (a story that could have made its subject ridiculous, but was told so terribly kindly) the time Oprah Winfrey told her publicly that her sexuality was nobody’s business, the time Paris Hilton, of all people, came through for her. Some of my favourite sections touched upon her joy in singing and performance. She’s too humble to boast of her accomplishments, other than being a damn hard worker, but it’s also clear that she’s always had a vision for herself, one she had power and confidence to execute—before that power and confidence was stripped from her.The night before we recorded “… Baby One More Time,” I was listening to Soft Cell’s “Tainted Love” and fell in love with that sound. I stayed up late so that I’d go into the studio tired, my voice fried. It worked. When I sang, it came out gravelly in a way that sounded more mature and sexier.Once I felt what was happening, I became so focused on the recording. And Max listened to me. When I said I wanted more R&B in my voice, less straight pop, he knew what I meant and he made it happen.Then, when all the songs were done, someone said, “What else can you do? Do you want to dance now?”I said, “Do I want to dance? Hell yeah, I do!”There are a lot of—far too many—reasons to feel sad and angry on Britney’s behalf. It has always, if I’m honest, slightly killed me how eager we have culturally been to diminish Britney, not just as a person, but as an artist. As if she always been nothing but the rote-performing mannequin her own family tried to make her. Instead of someone with real talent, passion and agency. Right at the beginning of the book, Britney tells us that singing is her truest voice, the one that allows her to express herself most fully. It’s fucked all the way up that we couldn’t even let her have that. I hope for her sake, as well as selfishly for my own, that she finds her way back to her art, her selfhood and her voice.And if this book is all of her voice she’s willing or able to give at the moment or for the rest of her life: I’m glad I listened.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5/5Ironiškai šyptelėjot, pamatę šią knygą ir mano įvertinimą?

Michelle Williams narrates the audiobook and I thought she did a good job.The book was ghostwritten and imo the first 40% seems too simple. It glosses over too many things and feels like a biography (it felt distanced). It’s when we hit the 40% mark that Britneys voice really shines through.This is such a sad memoir and not really a tell all. If you want to understand what Britney has been through and what has driven her to act out at times, then I recommend you pick this up. I feel so much for her and want only good things for her. Her family and all the stupid men in her life can fly a kite!Britney reminded me to see beyond what is portrayed on an IG feed or a photo in a gossip magazine. What would you do if your children were taken away from you? How would you react if the paparazzi followed you around constantly and caught you at your worst moments? How would you feel if your mother wrote a memoir about your mental breakdown and promoted it on tv instead of helping you or standing by your side when you needed her most? How would you feel if you didn’t have control over what you ate each day?I loved how she talked about sexism and double standards in the music industry and her admiration for Madonna. I love seeing and hearing her take back the power that was once not hers. A strong and powerful message.Everyone in her life has used her for their own fortune and fame and I don’t blame her that she uses mystery to surround her true self.I hope and pray that this story brings her peace and she finds comfort in people who love her for exactly who she is. A woman just wanting to be accepted and loved for the silly, lovable and spicy woman that she is.'}]"

Colleen Hoover tells fan favorite Atlas’s side of the story and shares what comes next in this long-anticipated sequel to the “glorious and touching” (USA TODAY) #1New York TimesbestsellerIt Ends with Us.Lily and her ex-husband, Ryle, have just settled into a civil coparenting rhythm when she suddenly bumps into her first love, Atlas, again. After nearly two years separated, she is elated that for once, time is on their side, and she immediately says yes when Atlas asks her on a date.But her excitement is quickly hampered by the knowledge that, though they are no longer married, Ryle is still very much a part of her life—and Atlas Corrigan is the one man he will hate being in his ex-wife and daughter’s life.Switching between the perspectives of Lily and Atlas,It Starts with Uspicks up right where the epilogue for the “gripping, pulse-pounding” (Sarah Pekkanen, author of Perfect Neighbors) bestselling phenomenonIt Ends with Usleft off. Revealing more about Atlas’s past and following Lily as she embraces a second chance at true love while navigating a jealous ex-husband, it proves that “no one delivers an emotional read like Colleen Hoover” (Anna Todd,New York Timesbestselling author).","[{'rating': 1, 'content': ""welcome to: “did this book really need to exist?” part 4343225.alternatively titled: a bland man does the bare minimum and people eat it up like he’s an austen character.i swore i’d never read another coho book, but it ends with us was the only one i could somewhat stomach so i decided to read it starts with us to see how it was.yikes.this review will be in bullet points. minor spoilers will be included, but read it anyway as a warning not to read this book.edit: for those of you in my comments going “if you don’t have anything nice to say don’t say it at all!”: we’re allowed to critically consume literature? i’m allowed to write a glowing review of one book and a critical review of another. that’s why this is abook reviewing site.like if you can’t handle seeing a one star review or acknowledging that people have different opinions, then don’t read one star reviews! there are thousands of five star ones you can read. go read those instead literally nobody is making you read this lmao.• i don’t get why this book had to exist. it just feels like she is monetizing off the weird success it ends with us got on booktok, and it definitely reads like a cash grab as well.• if it ends with us was about lily, why did colleen hoover work so hard to try and make atlas into a sexy hero? the only thing i could give it ends with us merit for was the message of breaking the cycle (even that is up for debate). this did not need a sequel at all.• atlas talking and defending himself about the age he and lily had sex was really breaking the fourth wall. coho definitely was trying to un-fuck up her mistake by making this a sympathy point.• lily and atlas didn’t really have a foundation of their relationship (which is ironic because atlas talks about ryle and lily’s relationship this way as well) other than the fact that they both had a bad childhood. lily puts atlas on this pedestal because he was there for her at her most vulnerable.• my theory still stands: colleen hoover, ironically, cannot write a good romance. i believe every single one of her books has these terrible, wild plot twists to cover up the fact that she cannot. lily and atlas had zero chemistry apart from them talking about how miserable they were when they first met and how they were each other’s saving grace.• also. i did not buy this book, i borrowed it from a friend, so i don’t have a ground to say this but: she included so many flashbacks and used pages of writing from it ends with us? lower the price girl.• a sequel, which is an outright romance, being written to a book (marketed as a romance which is so gross) about domestic abuse really throws me off.• (the letters were basically coho saying “see they are in love! they’re not bland! they do have other things in common other than their trauma!) which is false.• speaking of plot points manufactured to make lily and atlas seem like they had more in common: the brother thing came out of fucking nowhere.• lily doesn’t have a decent support system. i know she says that she does, but having your abusive ex husband’s sister as your best friend (and literally only her, as lily mentions in the book), is just not? like yes it’s better than nothing but i really hated the way allysa acted in a bunch of scenes. like is she supposed to be a likable character?• WHY IS LILY STILL WRITING TO ELLEN???

That is not to say that this book is perfect or that your review will be disingenuous. Books are subjective-- therefore there can be books that I love you hate, and books I hate that you love. I just don't understand or stand for the unwarranted amount of hate that goes into BASHING books just for the way they are written. I have been reading Colleen Hoover since 2012- Slammed was my first book by her. I have had many misses with her along with many hits.With that being said; I read It Ends With Us in 2016. I truly loved how it ended, I thought it was the end. I did not ever expect it starts with us and yet I could not think of what a beautiful and necessary addition this is.It Starts with Us shows the after effects of abuse in every form. It shows how realistic, how tragic and how even a happily ever after is still shadowed by the ache and reminder of abuse.I know people are going to be mad at how often Ryle shows up here but that’s the reality of how abusive situations are, they don’t just die or leave you alone— colleen did a fantastic job at showing how realistic this situation is, at how much of a gaslighter he is.For the Ryle apologist and stans: I’m so glad Colleen wrote this book because there’s NO room for y’all’s bullshit. He is an abuser. This isn’t a dark romance. This is a contemporary romance where an abuser stays abusive, continues to be abusive in the tiniest ways and the cycles are broken. He truly and will forever be a terrible person and I’m so glad that this book continuously highlighted that. Abusers don’t “change” and even if they do, the cycle should be broken forever.We get to see Lily and Atlas as an unit and we get to see them really fall in love with their love. I so deeply appreciated that aspect. We really do get to see them find their way back to each other and then fight for their love. This is THEIR story now.I also want to add, I loved the side characters. Every single one of them. Theo and Josh stole my goddamn heart. The only thing I rolled my eyes at was Lily writing to Ellen still but alas a book can’t be too perfect.Atlas has always been book boyfriend material but this book really cemented him as one of the good guys, and if not one of the top 10 book boyfriend’s in existence. I was not expecting this to get 5 stars from me, my favorite book by Colleen Hoover is Reminders of Him but this really deserves five stars for how thoughtful, realistic and just downright beautiful this was.It ends with us was about Lily and her journey to end the cycle of abuse. It starts with Us is about Lily and Atlas navigating life after ending their own cycles.We’ve reached the shores turned into You can come home now.""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '1.5In short, ‘It Starts With Us’ is nothing but an extended epilogue that could’ve been a bonus chapter. Everything about this book annoyed me; from lack of plot and bland characters, to commentary devoid of nuance and whole sections of the first book copied and pasted into the text. Something smells like a cash grab…I’ll admit; the discussion around abuse in this book wasn’t AS bad as in ‘It Ends With Us’, but it still felt pretty one dimensional and pissed me off at times. I can’t for the life of me understand why this series is hailed as one about ending the cycle of abuse, since the cycle of abuse in the books doesn’t even end!SPOILERSI understand that it would be very hard for Lily to win over Ryle in court, and the ending was probably more realistic with him still being involved; but if that’s the case, it doesn’t “end” with you and your daughter! If Ryle doesn’t have Lily in his life to abuse, guess who his next victim is going to be?Not to mention the fact that Lily’s closest friends are Ryle’s sister and his best friend; it is close to impossible to heal from abuse when you are still in such close proximity to your abuser. The way Allysa and Marshall talk about Ryle as if he’s a little kid who just gets mean sometimes, instead of the violent wife beater and attempted rapist that he is, is so strange…. Maybe I’m the weird one, but if someone I “love like a brother” were to push their partner down the stairs and bite them so hard they bled, I simply wouldn’t love them like a brother anymore!Allysa in particular was extremely annoying in this book. “Why would Ryle hate Atlas if you didn’t cheat on him 🥺🥺” idk girl maybe it’s because he’s abusive, which you have known for years now! The whole “me cheating on my husband doesn’t count because I was 19 ✨” thing was also???????????Idk man. Everyone in every Colleen Hoover book sends off massive alarm bells in my brain.“Problematic” aspects aside; ‘It Starts With Us’ was just plain bad a lot of the time. I feel bad for anyone who was looking forward to seeing Atlas’ perspective since he has about as much depth as a paper plate. We get it; Lily saved his life and he loves her! Fascinating. Now stop talking about it every 30 seconds and grow an actual personality, for the love of God! Pages of love letters and wedding vows don’t make up for an absence of depth, and certainly not lack of banter and attraction between characters.I don’t know if CoHo needs to go back to school or something, but there’s a biiiiiig difference between history and chemistry, and our main characters are missing the latter. News flash! Trauma bonding doesn’t mean you’re soulmates!! These people need therapy, not each other. I honestly think the story would’ve been more powerful had Atlas and Lily just been friends. Love cannot cure the trauma of an abusive relationship, no matter how strong it is.Rapid fire nitpicks from yours truly include; Ellen Degeneres, confusing time jumps, this being categorized as romance, the fact that only Atlas’ wedding vows were shown, and Emerson Dory being named Emerson Dory!Do yourself a good old favor and don’t waste your time and money on this ❤️'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""I don't dislikeIt Starts with Usper se, but it does feel more like a long and unnecessary epilogue toIt Ends with Usrather than the separate, worthwhile story it should've been.I remember vividly the experience of readingIt Ends with Us, how every page felt riveting and every moment essential. There were so many memorable scenes, so much emotion embedded in the pages. I sobbed my way through it, especially that ending that completely gutted me. To prep for this book, I reread the ending, and sure enough, it walloped me again.So it's rather disappointing that this story didn't do anything for me. There was no emotional punch, no compelling conflict. It took me days longer to read this than I anticipated because I didn't feel any pull to keep going. And now having finished this, I'm already unable to point to a single memorable moment because there honestly weren't any.But then, that's always the fear when an author gives in to fans and writes a sequel or prequel they originally had no intention of writing, isn't it? That the result would be mundane, at best an unnecessary add-on, at worst ruining the legacy of a previously amazing work. (I'm looking at you, Harry Potter and The Hunger Games.)More spelled out isn't always better. Whatever I had imagined in my head for Lily's future, it was more interesting than what I got. And in fact, to spell out Lily's future in the way that this sequel did took something away from the difficulty of Lily's decision at the end of the first book. Part of what I loved about that book was the nuanced and flawed characters, while this book distilled everyone down to either just a good guy or a bad guy.The other issue is that there is no real conflict or surprises in here. Sure, I enjoy reading a happy ending as much as the next person, but not for 300+ pages. It's clear without having read a single page of this book what will happen and who will end up happy. And sure enough, the story progresses and ends exactly the way you'd expect. And that just does not make for an enthralling read.This all sounds rather harsh, but it's really not that bad. It was an alright way to pass a few hours if you're not quite ready to leave the world of Lily and Atlas. This pleasant and unexciting story won't leave you breathless, but it shouldn't offend either. Just be ready to forget about it almost as soon as you're done.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:It Ends with UsVerityReminders of HimRegretting YouUgly LoveLayla~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '2.5⭐️If you love Atlas individually or Lily and Atlas as a couple, this is the book for you, you’d love this. However, I don’t feel like a sequel was necessary. The ending in It Ends with Us was perfect! It left us to imagine our own ending for Lily and it was realistic! This book was strictly written for Booktok. This doesn’t happen in real life. Women don’t always have a Prince Charming waiting for them after they escape an abusive relationship. This is why these idiots on TikTok are romanticizing this shit, thinking this is some kind of love triangle. Ryle is clearly still ill and it shows in this book?? CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE FUCKING GASLIGHTING HE TRIED TO DO TO LILY?”You won’t leave her with me overnight, but you’ll drop her off somewhere else when you want to get fucked? Great parenting, Lily.”“You disappoint me Lily.”“ I was happier before I met you.”HOW DARE PEOPLE DEFEND THIS FUCKER? BECAUSE OF HIS TRAUMA? HE KILLED HIS BROTHER AND HAS BEEN BLAMING HIS ANGER ON THAT SHIT EVER SINCE. HE THREW HER DOWN THE STAIRS. HE SLAPPED HER FOR LAUGHING. HE BIT HER. THEN PATCHED HER UP LIKE A CABBAGE PATCH DOLL. OMG. DID NO ONE NOT FIND IT DISTURBING THAT THIS MAN WAS A SURGEON? AFTER HE HURT HER, SHE DIDN’T EVEN HAVE TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL, HE IS THE HOSPITAL. THAT IS SO SCARY. FUCK YOU RYLE AND FUCK WHOEVER IS OBSESSED WITH YOUR TOXIC ASS.So clearly,When I read It Ends with Us, I didn’t care about the romance or Atlas as an individual. Atlas is very likable, but it wasn’t about that for me. I was more invested in Lily’s healing process and her story, I still felt that way going into this book. I truly just wanted to read this to see if Ryle would end up in fucking prison. I wanted to see if he was still wreaking havoc. Maybe I thought in this book, Ryle would acknowledge he’s a fucking monster and he’d watch Lily flourish happily from the sidelines. I couldn’t wait for the moment Lily stood up to him, that’s all I was looking forward to. I was only emotional for those parts specifically, I really don’t care about Atlas and Lily y’all.Theo making fun of Atlas was funny, I actually loved that because THE KEEP SWIMMING LINE WAS CORNY AS SHIT I DON’T CARE“We finally reached the beach, my little whale.”LMFAOOOOI wasn’t fond of the diary entries to Ellen in the first book and I especially didn’t like them here. It was cute when she was younger, but we’re grown folks now Lily. Ellen is not reading that shit, cut it out. Anyway, this was mid. Lily was too damn kind. Call me bitter, but if it were me, I’d leave Ryle to rot in hell and not let that man anywhere near my child.↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓My review before reading this:Few more days, it ends with us isnt my fav by her, but I’m pretty excited to read this!'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '2.5 starsWell this was useless.It Starts With Us in a nutshell:15%of this book is a retelling of the first one through Lily\'s creepy letters to Ellen.

Colleen even said that herself in the Acknowledgement section.I’ve readIt Ends with Usyears ago and that book made me bawl my eyes out, because it was such an honest and realistic story about a women finally ending the circle of abuse in her family. IEWU had a purpose and meaning. Whereas,It Starts With Usreads like every other second-chance romance between two past lovers that shared a connection in their childhood. Reading Lily and Atlas romance gave men o t h i n g. This was dryer than any cactus in the dept of the Sahara. Their interactions made me yawn, I’m sorry but Atlas was better as a side character in IEWU. Atlas is (maybe) the most unproblematic Colleen Hoover Hero, but imo that also makes him the most boring one.“I don’t have a picture of her,” I say to Theo.”So she’s ugly?” I toss the box of glass into the dumpster.“She’s gorgeous and way out of my league.””Ugly would still be out of your league,” he deadpans.12 year old Theo who talked like he was going on 50 was my favorite character in this book. And you know why? Because this little kid was pretty much bullying Atlas every time they interacted and I loved it. Some adults should be bullied more. 💅You disappoint me Lily.I was happier before I met you.Have fun fucking the homeless guy.Y’all can say anything nasty about Ryle and I would completely agree, but you also have to admit that this guy is nothing but ✨\xa0consistent ✨\xa0in his abusive behavior. My face was this 😐\xa0emoji the whole time, except when it came to Ryle, cause at least that guy gave me some emotions.. his texts to Lily even made me laugh… Lily, sweetie I’m sorry but your ex-husband humor is immaculate 🤡🏃🏻\u200d♀️\xa0Ryle kept me on my toes, cause I never knew what else would come out of his mouth or what would happen at the mercy of his fist.

",Ann Patchett,3.97,377810,214061,"Fiction, Audiobook, Literary Fiction, Romance, Historical Fiction, Contemporary, Family",309,01-08-2023,"In this beautiful and moving novel about family, love, and growing up, Ann Patchett once again proves herself one of America’s finest writers.In the spring of 2020, Lara’s three daughters return to the family's orchard in Northern Michigan. While picking cherries, they beg their mother to tell them the story of Peter Duke, a famous actor with whom she shared both a stage and a romance years before at a theater company called Tom Lake. As Lara recalls the past, her daughters examine their own lives and relationship with their mother, and are forced to reconsider the world and everything they thought they knew.Tom Lake is a meditation on youthful love, married love, and the lives parents have led before their children were born. Both hopeful and elegiac, it explores what it means to be happy even when the world is falling apart. As in all of her novels, Ann Patchett combines compelling narrative artistry with piercing insights into family dynamics. The result is a rich and luminous story, told with profound intelligence and emotional subtlety, that demonstrates once again why she is one of the most revered and acclaimed literary talents working today.","[{'rating': 2, 'content': 'I know, I know. Everyone loves Ann Patchett, just as everyone in this novel loves Joe and Sebastian and Lara and Ken and Maisie and the farm. Also Joe and Lara\'s three daughters, and the dog, and the grandmother. Also cherry pie. But a pile of comfy pillows only makes a nice place to read a good novel; it does not make an actual good novel.What happened to Ann Patchett\'s spice? To the rivalry and ambition and cunning and pain of her great novels like ""Commonwealth,"" ""The Dutch House,"" and""The Magician\'s Assistant""?In a word, this book is boring.Here\'s the plot, such as it is:As Covid spreads across the US in 2020, Joe and Lara are quarantining with their three grown daughters on the Michigan cherry farm that\'s been in Joe\'s family for generations. Without ordinary entertainment, this becomes a good time (supposedly) for Lara to tell the girls the story of her long-ago summer romance with Peter Duke, who later became a famous actor.That\'s the first problem: Since the daughters have spent their lifetimes repeatedly hearing that story and picking apart all the bits -- the eldest, Emily, is convinced that Duke is actually her father-- what\'s left for Lara to tell them? In order for this phony structure to work, someone has to constantly be saying: ""I can\'t believe I never asked you that before.""But the worse problem is that everyone is soooo loving and understanding. Joe isn\'t jealous of the focus on Duke. Lara doesn\'t regret giving up the lights and glory of her own acting career or the potential of sharing Duke\'s. The sisters exhibit no sibling rivalry. No one argues or disagrees, except occasionally in cute and minor ways. The sole narrative tension is whether they\'ll get all the cherries harvested in time.True, there\'s a good plot twist a bit more than halfway through, plus a few more twists after that (several of them eminently foreseeable and one totally unbelievable). But that\'s a long time to ask the reader to maintain interest.I didn\'t.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Oh, what a match made in Heaven! Ann Patchett’s writing and Meryl Streep’s delivery. This is a book that begs to be listened to rather than read. Although the writing is so divine, I might have to do both.The book is told from Lara’s viewpoint. Thanks to Covid, all three of her daughters are back home on the family’s cherry orchard. To help pass the days while picking cherries, they beg their mother to tell them of her romance with now famous actor Peter Duke. It’s both light and deep at the same time. It’s a look at the fun of summer stock theater, the innocence of young love, but also at what we chose to tell when we tell our stories (especially to family) and how well we can ever know our parents.Patchett just has a way with words. When describing the mania of young preteens, she likens it to giving them double chocolate cake with espresso.I had never read or seen Our Town. So, midway through this book, I quickly watched the 1940 movie. Spare yourself! And it’s totally unnecessary to know that play to enjoy this book.What I especially loved is that Lara has no regrets about the choices she made. She loves her husband, her farm, her daughters. In fact, the joy is that she made the right choices.Ok, I know I’m gushing, but this is such a wonderful ode to a real life, of recognizing both your strengths and weaknesses, of not necessarily reaching for the stars. And that ending!I know I would have loved this book regardless, but oh my God, Streep just took it up several notches.Update - so this is our January book club selection and I decided to read it this time. I loved it as much the second time around. And it definitely stands on its own, even without Meryl Streep.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'the best thing a book can be is:- about family- written by ann patchettthe other best thing a book can be is:- among the absolute fraction of things i read that magically, miraculously, divinely qualifies as 5 stars.this is both.i had no idea it was the great dream of my life to have three daughters and spend my days with them and my husband and a rescue dog picking cherries and telling stories in our orchard in michigan, but this was too damn dreamy for that not to be the case.it\'s too auspicious, encounteringmy second beloved michigan cherry book. plus they\'re my favorite fruit. i will hereby be retiring from the review game in order to dedicate my life to google maps-ing ""fruit trees accompanied by white farmhouses near lakes.""this book was strange and imperfect, kind of bumpy and (bizarrely) poorly edited and uncompelling in spots, but...i never stopped wanting to be reading it.whenever i\'m in my dear lovely favorite independent bookstore, i have a careful(ish) allowance. i can buy as many books from the on-sale rescue-these-books-from-remainder-table as my charitable heart desires, but i can only buy one full-price hardcover.this was that one.i chose really, really well.bottom line: sometimes you think you\'ll love a book, and then you do. that feeling never gets old.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4.25! Beautiful writing. Meryl Streep narrating the audiobook was so good.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""I hate to say it, butTom Lakefeels like a lot of nostalgic vibes and not much else.When I first dove in, I thought for sure this story would grab me. We're introduced to Lara right as she comes upon that prescient moment when she realizes she'd make a better Emily than all of the girls auditioning, and so begins her brief foray into the world of acting. It's a captivating vignette and a scintillating way to kick off the story.But alas, it's not meant to be. For slowly but surely, as we intercut between scenes, it dawns on me that this is the dreaded dual timeline. And while not all such stories are duds, chances are good that if a book employs it, one timeline always ends up being way more interesting than the other. And that's what happened here.You see, Lara and her husband are on their orchard, and their three grown daughters have come home to help them on the farm while hunkering down for the pandemic. The daughters want to know more about their mother's earlier life, and so she's telling them the story of her past.The crux of the problem is that anything remotely interesting is happening in the past. Lara's stint as an actress, the people and the situations that surround her, her romance with Duke, while all compelling, attribute to only one of the two timelines. Regrettably, this compelling narrative is constantly interrupted by what's happening in the present, with so many scenes of the daughters picking cherries while arguing about their own interpretations of their mother's history. And that just didn't interest me at all.It's almost as if the book is mirroringOur Town, the play mentioned within, by having the present timeline serve as its Stage Manager character, providing commentary and meaning for the past timeline. But that isn't necessary, and instead of adding to the story, the present only detracts from it.The writing doesn't help. It has this unedited, rambling, somewhat roundabout style that a lot of literary critics would fall all over themselves to describe as subtle and reflective, but I would just call much ado. It works fine when the subject is interesting, but when it's not, you've essentially combined fairly dull prose with a humdrum plot.I understand what this book is trying to do. It's taking a collection of prosaic, everyday happenings in the present, reaching back through the strands of time to tie it to the glorious possibilities of youth, and hence elevating the whole thing to be insightful and profound. But it didn't really achieve that. All it did was make me nostalgic for a bygone time. And while there's nothing wrong with that, I need a little bit more to really enjoy a story.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:The Dutch House~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'You might say this is Lara’s story of one summer in her early twenties when she played summer stock and was in love with an actor who later becomes a famous movie star. You might say it’s her three daughters’ stories who are home to help pick cherries on the family farm, since the workers can’t come during the pandemic. It’s not, though a story about the pandemic, for which I was thankful. It’s a story of family, of relationships, a story of the past and present and perhaps where the future will take these young women . About the future, perhaps because Lara’s story is really about realizing the only life she ever really wanted and that’s the story she tells them. The daughters beg Lara to tell them about that summer and they hang on her every word telling of the actor and then how Lara later fell in love with their father, who by the way stole my heart . I also hung on her every word and every word that Patchett wrote. I very much appreciated that the reader becomes privy to a few parts of the story that she doesn’t tell her daughters choosing to keep some things to herself and of course the reader . The writing is flawless , moving seamlessly back and forth between past and present even within chapters .To say that I was excited that Ann Patchett had a new novel is an understatement. To say that I was thrilled to be fortunate to get an advanced copy of it is a huge understatement. I fell in love with her writing from the first book of hers that I read,Bel Canto. Since then I’ve read all of her novels and a book of her essaysThese Precious Days: Essays. She’s a versatile writer and I’m never disappointed no matter what the novel is about because she just has such a talent for creating relatable characters and relationships. This novel is just one more reason why I’ll read anything she writes. I loved everything about it.I received a copy of this book from HarperCollins through Edelweiss.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""Sadly, not even Meryl Streep narrating the audiobook could make me want to finish this. I'm at the 15% mark and so far it's just stories about the mother's past about how she easily landed into professional acting, interspersed between scenes of her picking fruit on her farm with her family years later during the covid lockdown times. None of this is holding my attention.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Tom Lakeby Ann Patchett is a Woman's Story Within a Family Story!This is Lara's story of a summer long ago spent in summer stock theater at Tom Lake where, in her early twenties, she fell in love with an extremely handsome fellow actor named Peter Duke.It's also the story of Lara's family, her husband Joe, their three daughters, Emily, Maisie, and Nell, and their life together on the farm and fruit orchard that's been in their family for generations.It's the Spring of 2020 with the Pandemic in full swing and all three adult daughters are home. It's cherry picking time which calls for all-hands-on-deck from this family since there's limited help due to the shutdown.Emily, Maisie, and Nell are fascinated and curious about their mother's past as an actress who shared the stage and a relationship with a famous movie star. They're begging to hear everything about it.Since they're all together in one spot and Lara is sufficiently worn down by her daughters pleas, they all continue to pick cherries in their orchard while Lara begins to tell them her story...Tom Lakeis a story within a story. It's about choices and relationships, coming to terms with the choices you make, the relationships you build on, and the ones you don't. It's about planning for and living an intentional life.When I readThe Dutch HouseI struggled to connect with this author's writing style. It felt dry, unemotional, and lacked the passion I anticipated. I had a similar experience withTom Lakeand although it was better at the midway point and at the end, it still ebbed and flowed for me.The last twenty-percent of this book completely held my attention and the ending fit the characters and the story like a glove. It's important for an author to end with something for the reader to chew on and Ann Patchett did exactly that.What I love aboutTom Lakeare the central characters. They are diverse, fully fleshed out, and interesting. I cared about and fell in love with all of them. I especially love Joe. Everyone needs someone like Joe in their life. This author certainly knows how to create wonderful characters, good ones and not so good ones. All aboard!I'm glad this author has such a strong following with many positive reviews and high ratings for this book. I likeTom Lakebut I don't love it and I was expecting a better reading experience than I had. I do plan to listen to one of Patchett's previous books via audiobook to see if a different format will change how I feel about her writing overall. Maybe, maybe not, but I'm willing to try.3.5⭐Thank you to NetGalley, Harper, and Ann Patchett for an ARC of this book.

Oh and since it’s Covid…( so over the Covid books) we are all talking and reminiscing so I’m going to tell my long boring story of how I met your dad. The end.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4.5⭐Set in Spring 2020 amid the COVID-19 lockdown,Tom LakebyAnn Patchettrevolves around former actress Lara Kenison who lives and works with her husband in their family cherry orchard in Michigan. The pandemic has brought her whole family together as they shelter in place and help in the day-to-day operations of the orchard, making up for the shortfall in seasonal staff. Emily, the oldest of her three daughters, all of whom are in their twenties, is the only one who plans to take up running the farm in the future. Lara’s youngest daughter, Nell, aspires to become an actress, and her middle daughter Maisie is studying to become a veterinarian.Her daughters press their mother for details of her short-lived romance with famous actor Peter Duke when she was in her twenties, while they were both part of the summer theater production of Thornton Wilder’s Our Town in Tom Lake, Michigan. Peter wasn’t a famous actor back then and though their romance was short-lived, Lara’s experiences in Tom Lake played a significant role in the trajectory of her life.The narrative follows Lara as she shares significant episodes from her past, her brief career as an actress – her childhood and foray into acting in Community Theater and the years that followed. The narrative is shared from Lara’s first-person perspective and we are privy to her innermost thoughts - her personal reflections on the important people, the significant events and the difficult choices that shaped her life- as she deliberates over what and how much to share with her family and the memories that she holds close to her heart. Their reactions to their mother’s revelations range from awe to humor to indignation on her behalf, enabling them to see and understand their mother as the young women she once was, not too different from themselves. Lara’s stories are spaced between present-day events, her family life on the family orchard with her husband and her interactions with her daughters wherein we get to know more about their dreams and aspirations, motivated to share significant memories and confidences inspired by their mother’s stories. This is a character-driven, quiet and relatively slower-paced novel with well-thought-out characters. Ann Patchett’s writing is beautiful and past and present timelines are woven seamlessly into a cohesive narrative that revolves around themes of family, love, ambition, choices, motherhood and mental health. The writing is sparse with minimal melodrama yet emotionally impactful with an ending that brings all the threads of the story together in the most satisfying way. I enjoyed every moment of this beautiful story.I won a copy of Tom Lake in a Goodreads Giveaway. Many thanks to the author and publisher for the gifted copy. All opinions expressed in this review are my own.Please note:The play Our Town is of great significance in both Lara’s short-lived career as an actress and her life in general. Though it isn’t necessary to have read Our Town by Thornton Wilder to enjoy Ann Patchett’s Tom Lake, I feel having prior knowledge of the story would contribute to a rich reading experience and a greater appreciation of this novel.Connect with me!✏Instagram✏My Blog✏The StoryGraph'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'I don’t understand the rave reviews but so be it. For me this was boring, as in, put the book down and want to scream boring; as in grit my teeth because it’s still not finished boring. There was no edge, no humor, no slant.None of the characters were developed into believable, living people. The daughters were distinguable only by their chosen vocations. The main character is someone I would feign illness to avoid at an office party for lack of personality. What is Joe like? I have not the faintest clue. And Duke? Just his vices and his teeth. And our Sebastian? Wtf? Please. I know nothing about these characters after slogging through the book for hundreds of pages.The novel consists of the main character relaying a brief acting career and romance from her pre-married life to her daughters who are riveted for reasons I don’t understand. Who are these docile creatures? Why are they so lacking in fight, independence, mischief and rebellion at their age? Instead they wait with baited breath day after day for the least interesting pre-married life romance I’ve ever heard. The story telling within the novel is interrupted periodically by cherry picking and yes, I felt like I was there in the orchard plotlessly looking at cherries. I assumed something interesting would be revealed from her past life. Boy was I disappointed.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Ah, Patchett. This story is the cherry on top. And in centre.

The clunky attempt to include Covid was the last straw for me.Until I read this book I was a fan, particularly of Bel Canto and Commonwealth.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'What a lovely experience this was, listening to the incomparable Meryl Streep bring to life a book of Ann Patchett’s. As much as I have my go-to narrators, Meryl Streep brought a whole new level of humanity, humor, and kindness to each character and to the story as a whole. I could just feel her nuanced, multi-faceted intelligence through her craft. If other narrators give 5-star readings, Meryl Streep is off the charts.I really enjoyed the story, too. In a way, it was a story about the power of story. A woman, her husband, and their three grown daughters are living together during the pandemic on a farm in Michigan. The family gathers around and listens to the mother tell stories of her past, when she fell into acting and dated a movie star before he was one. There is power in the simple act of sharing stories, and there was something idyllic about this close family gathered together for it on a cherry orchard.I loved the Meryl-Streep-embodied main character most of all, Lara, the mother, when she recounted what lead to acting in a summer stock theater nearby the farm. I knew what she meant when she said that a summer stock day was packed with the normal intensity of a week, and so on from there. It brought me back to times of sleep away camp when couples and best friends were determined by the first night. The heightened sense of being away from home, and thrown into newness and possibility, was well captured. It’s no accident that colleges and universities by tradition house people of the same age together for a particular kind of learning and transition into adulthood. Patchett’s summer stock brought me back.The reason Lara tells this story is because all of her grown daughters want to hear about the famous movie star she dated. It’s a strong, believable reason, made more interesting by the sheer joy of youth and first love. As the story unfolds, it reveals the personalities and relationships between them in the here and now. It also deals with the fear that the world is ending. And while the mother is pretty straight with her daughters, she shares only with us what she’s kept to herself, highlighting how stories are made by what she chose to tell, and revealing the paths not taken.Lara also admits her guilty pleasure of enjoying her daughters at home, despite it being because of the global pandemic. The knowledge that this is temporary makes it all the more precious—just like summer stock. Just like a life. Maybe just like our world.4.5'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '2.5 stars. I like Ann Patchett. Some of her novels are better than others, but in general I think she’s a really good writer, and I was looking forward to this release. Of course the writing is solid—I was interested in the cherry farm setting, and the relationship between the narrator and her grown daughters.But… I just did not buy the whole massive-movie-star-who-was-once-my-summer-boyfriend-thing. Peter Duke did not come across as a beautifully gifted, if somewhat troubled, actor—he came across as a manipulative jerk. There was nothing attractive about him.I also grew tired of all the “Our Town” references (unpopular opinion but that play is so irritating) and the Covid timeframe. I’m not ready to read novels set during Covid, especially ones that romanticize the experience as a time to make potato salad and to hand sew face masks. Get serious. But maybe that’s just me…'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Ann Patchett is so wise. About love, about family, and about pretty much everything life throws our way.I decided she was my new best friend after I listened to the audiobooks of her two essay collections,This is the Story of a Happy MarriageandThese Precious Days, the latter of which is a true masterwork. Her intelligence, empathy for others, and logical way of looking at life drew me to her, and I have such admiration for who she is and all that she’s accomplished.Now that my fangirling is out of the way, I’ll move on to the book.Tom Lake, her latest … I loved it. But I didn’t know if I would, seeing as it’s a homage to Thornton Wilder’sOur Town, a play I’ve neither seen nor read. I should’ve known, though, that all I adore about Patchett would shine through the story, allowing me to not be bothered by my unfamiliarity with the play.The novel consists of Lara telling her three grown daughters the story of the summer she starred inOur Townand dated the now-famous movie star, Peter Duke. Patchett switches between Lara’s story of that summer with what is happening in the present day, where it’s the spring of 2020, COVID has invaded the world, and all three daughters have returned to the family orchard in Northern Michigan to pick cherries.At first the story felt a bit too mundane. My attention wandered, and I worried that my foray into Patchett’s fiction would be a disappointment. But the beauty of her prose never allowed me to set the novel aside, and before I knew it, I was so engrossed in Lara’s tale that I forgot all else while I read it. It’s just the kind of book it is – it sneaks up on you.There are surprising revelations throughout the story, along with warm meditations on marriage and children and love in all its shapes and sizes. And also present is a subtle urging to enjoy life in the moment and appreciate what is yours.Tom Lakegives so much to the reader, and because of the ease in which Patchett’s words flow across the page, it asks for very little in return.My sincerest appreciation to Ann Patchett, Harper, and NetGalley for the digital review copy. All opinions included herein are my own.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""Rare occasion where the audiobook is better than the textYep, scandalous I know, but I am going to share my disappointments about a book set largely in Michigan.

The setting of the cherry farm was romantic and evocative. However, all of this was not enough to keep me engaged in a storyline that I had no interest in. I did not care for the acting story that Lara was telling her daughters and grew bored with these bits of the novel. I enjoyed the relationships Lara has within her family but just didn't want to know more when it came to her past reminiscences.This honest review is given with thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for this book.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I'm not sure how Ann Patchett keeps getting better and better with each book, but she does. I have loved them all, some more than others, but this is my favorite, probably until the next one.A master at her craft, the top of her game, a writer's writer, literary superstar....take your pick of cliches, they're all true, at least for me.Tom Lake is a place, not a person, as I thought before reading it. It's a beautiful tribute to Thornton Wilder's Our Town. Lara played Emily Webb, the female lead, in high school, then went on years later to play her in summer stock theater in Tom Lake, Michigan. She falls in love with another actor, who goes on to become a famous movie star. She later marries the owner of a cherry farm in Michigan and raises a family. During the Covid shutdown, her three adult daughters come home to spend the summer helping in the cherry orchard, and beg for the story of her relationship to the actor. Which they get, in bits and pieces, but not all of it; no mother is going to tell her daughters everything.Our Town infuses the whole plot, wrapped around the Tom Lake action, but the present day scenes as well. Lara wouldn't be where she is without Our Town, her life would be poorer had it never happened. This novel takes place in different timelines, so expertly done that we readers are always there, never really knowing how it's going to pan out, but knowing that it will. Surprises all along the way, pleasant ones mostly, leading to an ending that couldn't be more perfect. Patchett gives us the same wisdom as Wilder did. Things happen, life goes on, we all do the best we can in our own little corners of the world.I read Our Town in high school, later saw a stage production of it, and yesterday watched the 1940 film version. The sound and picture quality is awful, but the acting is pretty good. I'm betting that sales of the play are going to skyrocket after this book, and local and national theater groups will decide to bring it back. Tom Lake is a great book even if you aren't familiar with the play, but the play itself is pretty spectacular. Read them both, just for the sheer entertainment value.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️💫(4.5/5)Oh, this book was exquisite. The writing was so lovely, and I found myself fully immersed in this story. It’s not a love story in the conventional sense, but it is a love story between a woman and her daughters, her life, her husband, and her past. I feel like saying a book is slow has such negative connotations, but I really mean it in the best way possible. This book is to be savored and read slowly. Sometimes, when reading, in my excitement, my eyes can’t help but hop around. This book forced me to be present and alert. Much better paired with a cup of coffee than a cocktail (although I am pairing it with a cocktail!).Our book is set in the spring of 2020. We meet Lara, who owns a cherry farm in Northern Michigan with her husband. Due to COVID, her 3 adult daughters have returned home to help with the harvesting. As a way to pass the time and due to the relentless curiosity of her daughters, Lara is sharing the story of her first love, who now happens to be one of the most famous actors in the world. While this is set at the peak of the pandemic, COVID is merely a footnote, and I didn’t find it terribly distracting.This story has the intimacy of a kitchen table shared with your mom and aunts. Sharing stories over glasses of wine and getting a peak into their past. It’s brimming with love and contains so much honesty when it comes to mother-daughter relationships. It made me want to call my mom and yearn for a daughter one day. I thought it was just such an excellent portrayal of family and love.I love the tone of this story. I only hope that in 30 years, I find myself at peace with myself and my decisions as Lara is.Audiobook fans - the audiobook is narrated by Meryl Streep! What a treat!'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'I was very excited to get the advanced copy of this book!I’ve only read two other books by this author but I enjoyed them immensely.This book is set mostly in northern Michigan, and I am a lifelong Michigander.. it also brought up names of cities just a couple miles away from me which was very cool.The story of Lara … who lives on an orchard up north with her husband and three grown daughters .. it’s during the time of the pandemic and all the daughters are home, very busy with cherry picking and helping out since their lives are on pause during this time, as they are working together, they want to hear about their mom’s brief career as an actress in summer stock at Tom Lake..very close to home..and her relationship with a well known male movie starA story about family and relationships..I really enjoyed!Thank you to Netgalley and HarperCollins for the ARC!'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'So, here I am...Today, is May 29, 2024. It is about 6 months later since I originally posted this review. This book has been haunting me. Has that ever happened to you? Where you read a book, and you thought you loved it, and it comes back (well, it was donated to my Little Free Library Shed), and I looked at it again, and I said to myself, you weren\'t honest about this book originally were you? And I said, ""what do you mean?"" And, I said, ""You didn\'t like it as much as you said you did, did you?""Well, at the time, I let it go. But now 6 months later, looking at it again, I realized, I couldn\'t. My guilty self really didn\'t like it as much as I thought I did. I will still keep my original review here, but I thought I would mention it in this intro paragraph, for anyone who happens to visit... I will also be readjusting my bookshelves to reflect the change.Review...We are experiencing the spring of 2020, the start of the Covid-19 lockdown with Lara, now 57. She is sheltering in place with her husband, Joe Nelson, and their 3 20-something daughters, Emily, Maisie and Nell. With harvesters scarce, this opens the time up for Lara to tell her story about her brief career as an actor.The highlight of her life as Emily Gibbs, the tragic heroine in “Our Town.”The story is told in flashbacks.And…It showcases Lara playing Emily in both high school and college in New Hampshire, with a brief detour to Hollywood, and then…Summer stock at a theater company, the titular Tom Lake (hence: the title of the book), that happened to be near-ish the orchard.At Tom Lake, Lara, who plays the character Emily, has eyes only for 28-year-old Peter Duke, another actor who played the father in the play.He actually goes on to become a huge celebrity, a serious actor who eventually wins an Oscar, but also descends into addiction.But…While at Tom Lake, Duke and Lara spend all their time together, rehearsing, having sex, or swimming in the lake.Still…When the summer ends, so does everything else.As mentioned, Duke is off to his successful Hollywood career.Lara on the other hand quits acting, marries her cherry farmer, Joe, and becomes a mother.Lara’s Emily grows convinced that Duke, was her actual father – so much so, that even readers are left in genuine suspense about whether it is possibly true, as well.But…The larger theme is that it may not matter…Children inherit the full range of our experience, as much as genetic traits.This novel is folksy, cozy, domestic contentment.When Nell laments the celebrity Lara could perhaps have been, she exclaims…“Look at this! Look at the three of you! You think my life would have been better spent making commercials for lobster rolls?”Each daughter is given their own personality. Emily – fiery; Maisie - sensible; and Nell - intuitive.Against the backdrop of the pandemic, and their mother’s backstory, this book becomes a wistful meditation – a story of mothers and daughters. An opportunity for closure for Lara.Maybe…Even an awakening of what is important to Lara – of what she is lucky to have – what any of us are lucky to have, in these circumstances.Is this a peaceful existence? Is Lara really happy?Or…Did she find a contentment, because that is what one settles for in life?I understand that the audio version has Meryl Streep as the voice narrating. That must have been a real treat for readers of this book.Added note... (5-29-24)And perhaps that is what was missing for me...something was off. Would I have felt differently if I listened to Meryl Streep tell the story? I don\'t know. I don\'t care. But, for anyone who liked my original 5 stars, I am sorry if I am disappointing you now.3.5 stars rounded down. I know. Sometimes re-visits aren\'t always nice.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Well this book took me way longer to read than expected… This was another book that I had high hopes for as I loved Patchett’s “The Dutch House”. This book is also set in northern Michigan, and I am a true Michigander- I’ve lived in Michigan all my life, so I really thought that I would love this book even more. One of the characters even attended college at Michigan State, where my son is currently a freshman- so I thought I would really resonate with this book. Unfortunately, this book fell very flat for me. I almost gave up on “Tom Lake” several times. However, the last 100 pages or so redeemed themselves and I stuck with it.This story takes place in the Spring of 2020 during the pandemic. Lara’s three daughters have come back home to the family farm/cherry orchard. During this time Lara begins to tell her daughters about the time she spent a summer with a famous actor named Peter Duke, at a theater called Tom Lake. During this summer Lara was only 24 years old, never married and her daughters had not yet been born.During this summer between Lara and Peter Duke, they were in a play called Our Town and Lara played Emily. Lara and Duke were a hot item, and then a sudden turn of events happened and they went their separate ways. Lara decided not to continue with acting, but Duke rose to stardom. Lara’s three daughters are infatuated with Peter Duke, especially her oldest daughter Emily.So yeah… this was a decent enough story, but I think that I was expecting so much more. I mean I think we could all write a book about some of our crazy, wild love affairs that we had when we were younger (and some would be way more entertaining than this story). If I’m being honest, this book was a bit of a snooze fest 😴- not my favorite by Patchett. Although, I will be watching for her next book!This was a Reese Witherspoon book club pick for August, 2023. With that being said, I can see why there are so many high ratings…(2.5 stars, rounded up)'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""It is a relief to pick up an Ann Patchett novel, even one that is Just Fine, like this one. I don't know how her books are so utterly absorbing, but they are. There is not a lot to this book, though that doesn't mean it's short on pleasure. A woman recounts an old love affair to her adult daughters as they pick cherries on their family farm. It isn't as leisurely as it sounds, it is the summer of 2020, most of the usual workers aren't there, but the cherries still must be picked and life must go on.Most of the substance of the book is the story Lara tells us, which is as much a story about her time as an actress as it is about this love affair. Lara has the kind of unlikely fairy tale of a story that doesn't really happen anymore, much to the chagrin of her daughter who actually wants to be an actress, and she stumbles into almost everything that happens to her. Somehow she has never really told her daughters the whole story, and now as her daughters are around the age she was it and they have nothing but time it finally seems like the right time to tell it.This is technically a pandemic novel and yet it hardly is one. This ties into my major complaint with the book, in that it feels strangely sanitized. In the current events part of the plot, everyone is good. Lara loves her husband Joe, who never does anything that is not perfect and kind. She has a good relationship with her three daughters, who may have their own complicated feelings about being at home and pausing their own lives, but Lara is delighted, so glad they are there that she almost entirely overlooks those difficulties. It is not that people like Lara aren't realistic, at one point she is baffled that her daughters question the point of having children because of climate change and yup there are a lot of people like Lara who find this baffling. But Lara's happiness is rather dull. She does not seem all that concerned about the global pandemic or all the people dying. She is that mom who is just happy her kids are home. It's strange to read that presented as the narrative point of view without any interrogation.It is an easy book to read, a light one, too. Bad things happen, but the worst of it is already over. And really, the book seems to say, if you just stay with your family on a cherry farm everything will just be fine forever. Sometimes that is the book you want, and that is what Patchett has given us. It's a bit strange, since her family dynamics have usually been so complex, but perhaps she just wanted a nice, small something.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""If Ann Patchett's prose had a back, it would be aching from carrying this low-stakes, low-conflict and low-probability story all on its own.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Ann Patchett is the unassuming one. She is the quiet girl at the back of the class who listens deeply and watches with eyes that are almost too dark for the paleness of her face.Ann Patchett is the wholesome one. She likes to wear ascetic dresses with flowers on them, cinched at the waist, splattered with petals like a silhouetted field.Ann Patchett is the subdued one. She is Rachel in “Witness”, a wild flame dancing behind her austere Amish kapp. She is Francesca in “The Bridges of Madison County”. She is Tereza in “The Unbearable Lightness of Being”. Pale heroines, again, but pale as incandescent, white-hot, electrifying, zigzagging like lightning on your horizon line.Beware of Ann Patchett’s modesty, her innocence, her decency, her moonlit radiance, her genuine, contagious curiosity about humans and her passion for living. She is all of these things and more. But she wears these virtues on her sleeve and on the page like hard-earned battle scars. She takes no prisoners.Don’t be fooled by the bed of daisies on the cover or by the sleepy synopsis. The quiet girl of American Letters has listened very deeply since the pandemic and in this unassuming, incandescent novel, she has engaged in a profoundly moving, exhilarating and most bittersweet conversation with “Our Town”, one of her favorite works of art.“Tom Lake” is pure dry lightning, a flash in the sky, the sudden brightness that illuminates the room when there was nothing but dark.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I can’t believe I’m going to write this but this book was so boring. I just couldn’t get into it. I’m not a big fan of theater so I feel like this wasn’t going to speak to me and was hoping I’d be proven wrong. I wasn’t. What also caused dissonance was the fact that Meryl Streep narrates it (beautifully) and I kept getting her mixed up with the character!Maybe another season I’ll try again as I love Ann Patchett.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I don't fall in love with many books but this one is too beautiful not to.So my advice would be that if you haven't already seen Our Town then you either read the play or watch the movie (even though they changed the end of the 1940 version) because this book is an homage to that play.The story of Lara Kinnison, Joe Nelson and Peter Duke is a mirror of Our Town by Thornton Wilder. Lara is a small town girl who plays Emily from Our Town in a community theatre production. Some producer sees her and whisks her away to Hollywood but events conspire and Lara finds herself back in Michigan at Tom Lake playing summer stock as Emily opposite the charismatic Peter Duke.This novel is steeped in the same spell that Our Town casts. It follows Lara into the next generation where, years later, she is a wife and mother -- her grown daughters home during lockdown to help bring in the cherry harvest on the family farm. As they work Lara recounts her life as an actress, her love affair with Duke and how she ended up with the real hero of the story, their father.This is my first Ann Patchett, it won't be my last. I found the rhythm of her prose hypnotic. I found myself speaking the dialogue with the same slow drawl as used in Our Town. It is primarily a book about family and continuity, about ambitions and real dreams, about love and acceptance and understanding. It is about knowing who you really are and what you really want from life.I honestly loved this book and I certainly didn't expect to.Highly recommended. Thankyou to Netgalley and Bloomsbury Publishing for the advanced review copy.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Set in the early summer of 2020, Ann Patchett's ninth novel once again tackles the messy nature of family life and how our hold of the past can shape or mar our present experience, depending on our point of view.Lara is a mother of a three and married to a cherry farmer in Michigan. She spends a week or two recounting the summer she spent performing in a production of Thornton Wilder'sOur Townand falling in love with Peter Duke, who would go on to become a famous movie star, at the eponymous Tom Lake.Patchett expertly weaves together the past and present, having the daughters interject and question their mother, and then pulling as back into Lara's recollections.The prose is cozy, warm and rose-colored. But Patchett doesn't sit in that space for too long, letting Lara give the reader's more information than she does her daughters. It's in the telling that the story is shaped and asks: can we be happy with a life when we know there is another one we might have lived?I laughed out loud many times during this story, and also got chills from its sobriety. We all can remember how it felt in the early days of the pandemic, how fragile life seemed, like a wispy cherry blossom falling from a gnarled branch. And yet there isn't despair in this story. Like inOur Town, life ends in a cemetery, and so too does this story; but not, perhaps, how you think.I perhaps struggled a bit with the ending, as I do sometimes with life and its cliches. But they are cliches for a reason, and while it could have felt avoidable, I choose to believe Patchett, in her many years of living, loving and writing, chose to end things as she did simply because some things in life are unavoidable. It's simply what you choose to pay attention to that ends up feeling, at times, inevitable.""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""DNF at 66%. The parts about cherry-picking had some charm, but I just hated the reminiscing about acting. It felt as though the main character was in some version of the same play maybe half-a-dozen times (though it was probably three or four), as well as acting in a film, commercials, and a sitcom. We learn nothing about her time on the sitcom or filming the commercials and precious little about her time on the film. Her years in the theater were largely spent on cigarettes, alcohol, and a boyfriend who went on to become famous. He smoked and drank, and became famous that's all I learned about him, other than his name. Like most of the novel's characters, he lacked distinguishing traits and was incredibly dull. However, the main character's three daughters are fascinated with him and want to keep hearing more about him because for some reason they haven't already heard a ton about this famous, super-boring guy their mom used to date.

Deadly consequences… Bestselling sensation Juniper Song is not who she says she is, she didn’t write the book she claims she wrote, and she is most certainly not Asian American—in this chilling and hilariously cutting novel from R.F. Kuang, the #1 New York Times bestselling author ofBabel.Authors June Hayward and Athena Liu were supposed to be twin rising stars. But Athena’s a literary darling. June Hayward is literally nobody. Who wants stories about basic white girls, June thinks.So when June witnesses Athena’s death in a freak accident, she acts on impulse: she steals Athena’s just-finished masterpiece, an experimental novel about the unsung contributions of Chinese laborers during World War I.So what if June edits Athena’s novel and sends it to her agent as her own work? So what if she lets her new publisher rebrand her as Juniper Song—complete with an ambiguously ethnic author photo? Doesn’t this piece of history deserve to be told, whoever the teller? That’s what June claims, and the New York Times bestseller list seems to agree.But June can’t get away from Athena’s shadow, and emerging evidence threatens to bring June’s (stolen) success down around her. As June races to protect her secret, she discovers exactly how far she will go to keep what she thinks she deserves.With its totally immersive first-person voice, Yellowface grapples with questions of diversity, racism, and cultural appropriation, as well as the terrifying alienation of social media. R.F. Kuang’s novel is timely, razor-sharp, and eminently readable.","[{'rating': 2, 'content': '2.5/5i feel weird writing this review. for one, Yellowface isn’t out until next year. two, the book is very meta about twitter and book reviews—ratings on goodreads even make up several important plot points. i feel like me and the book are engaging in some inside joke.i’ve decided not to include any quotes from the book and talk in general terms with minor details to avoid spoilers (not anything that’s not in the premise, anyway), but i’m still talking about how i felt about different parts of the book, including the middle and end, even though I won’t be talking about what happens in them. so if you want to go in blind, beware. i know this runs the risk of me describing something one way, but then you going and reading it and interpreting a different way, but until it actually comes out and i can drop the ‘extended’ (and hopefully more sophisticated) review, this will have to do.yellowface is meant to be drama and dark satire. it’s a bit hilariously grim and grimly hilarious to anyone who’s ever needed to close booktwt and touch grass, but also interesting to anyone moderately familiar with books, writing or publishing. the prose isn’t babel, where i was stopping every page to savour the writing style, but it is fast-paced and fairly easy to get through. and i’m kind of torn about yellowface, but the worst part is that i can’t figure out whether it’s in a “this didn\'t work for me, personally” way, or a more objective “this is a Critique” way.my problem with yellowface comes down to the fact that i cannot separate the narrative voice from rfk’s voice at all. a lot of the experiences of a certain character lines up very much with what i know is rfk’s own, and that is on purpose and not necessarily bad—she’s an author who’s always been very open about putting a lot of herself into her books and it’s one of the things that can add to their emotional depth. a lot of readers will likely proclaim the fact you can’t unsee the hand of the author in the writing is The Point. however, when the characters start to receive criticisms that are very similar to criticisms rfk has faced, but represented somewhat flatly, i cock my head a bit. see: problematic representation of Taiwanese indigenous people (a criticism in isolation that depnding on the book may be valid, but in yellowface is shown to be made by people who are just jealous of the author and don’t actually know what they’re talking about), privately-educated, rich western diaspora writing about traumatic histories of working classes from the homelands they’ve only visited a few times (a criticism in isolation that depending on the author may be valid, but in yellowface is made from the perspective of the racist white woman using it to justify her horrible actions), etc.this may not bother other readers, but i can’t help but side-eye it. she gets around it by having these criticisms be made by mouthpieces—that’s another thing about yellowface, by the way.so many mouthpieces.i don’t think this is a book where readers will get very attached to the characters, not just because the mc is an unreliable narrator, but because yellowface is more of a book where characters are tools that represent different things and perspectives and are meant to be grimly watched, observed and laughed at from above. which is mostly fun, until you start to distinguish between rfk’s mouthpieces a bit: which ones she represents more flatly and more caricatured, and the one she gives more nuanced paragraphs to, from under which i think I can make out the haze of her opinions. and i’m not fond of them all the time.as always, it’s certainly interesting, but the middle of the book is basically all twitter discourse. it had me wondering if i could just scroll through my timeline and get the same experience instead. it’s veryyy meta—sometimes fun, sometimes obnoxious. maybe it’s too ‘high concept’ for me, sorry, or maybe it\'s heavy-handed. and it makes my job writing this difficult, because how much can i attribute to the unreliable narrator, satirical style or rfk herself? where does one end and the other begin, if they do so at all?(which was a big thing that irked me with tpw. people would make criticisms of rfk\'s narrative choices and plot points and the response would be ‘well, rin is an unreliable narrator!’ yes, but there is such thing asframingandcontextwhich are important things to consider when trying to figure out what an author actually is saying, intentionally or not. but anyways.)speaking of slightly more well-written unreliable narrators, juniper song is… a character. more of an awful ball of jealous, racist, liberal misery who you get to follow the entertaining downward spiral of throughout the book than a person. at least, when she\'s not hindered by rfk\'s blunt writing style striking her on the head. the commentary and discussion yellowface wants to have about publishing and racism is genuinely interesting and important, but I enjoyed yellowface most when it doing less back-and-forth with its own themes and more about the fucked up relationship between athena liu and juniper song/june hayward/athena liu. ie,when it was more about actual people than rfk\'s comemntary.despite athena dying at the very start of the story, she haunts the narrative, sometimes through flashbacks, sometimes through other people’s experiences, sometimes literally. and the narrativeisjuniper. i love a good fucked up friendship/rivalry/impersonation?/whatever the fuck this is. there\'s a flashback where we find out about a fucked up thing athena did regarding a traumatic event juniper went through--something which in no way justifies the scale of what juniper does throughout the book, but muddies the waters and makes everyone involved seem like more flawed, three-dimensional people. keyword, people! and whenever that relationship had the spotlight, i couldn’t put yellowface down. it\'s insane the narrative spent more time on its self-indulgent satire than it does on its genuinely compelling emotional core.which is why i was really loving the third act, in which a lot of my criticisms seemed to fall away and the mess of the premise was really coming to a head. i was reading it late at night and, even though it’s not a horror, i got actually creeped out by several parts. to be honest, if yellowface had stuck the landing, it could have been four stars.and that’s my final problem with yellowface. it has a decent plot, interesting cast of characters, interesting themes and discussions, but my only feeling on the ending was,‘…that’s it?’i know i said i wouldn’t do quotes, but im making an exception for the bit where our narrator says,‘I’ve written myself into a corner. The first two thirds of the book were a breeze to compose, but what do i do with the ending? Where do I leave my protagonist, now that there’s no clear resolution?’Which is very meta, because based off the ending, i feel that’s the position rfk was in at that exact point. i can somewhat tell she struggled with where to take the ending and i have more thoughts on why i felt underwhelmed by it, but i guess that’ll be for 2023, for when it\'s no doubt on all the \'Very Important Books of the Year\' lists. for now, i can see myself rereading babel and parts of tpw, but i don’t see myself rereading yellowface.it\'s now 2023. in short, the ending is less a bang, and more of a whimper. rfk rules out a geoff-style ending for june, someone who disappears quietly from public memory after the scandal and becomes old news. she\'s too attached to athena\'s image. this is the right choice--june is too much of a villain-protagonist to get an unearned, \'soft\' ending at the end of this. but then the \'crash-and-burn\' ending needed to be a lot more to be satisfying for me. we get hallucinations, suicidal ideation, her isolating herself from her support network, all of this building and building and building--and then it goes...nowhere.oh, we get a fascinating final confrontation with candace, one of athena\'s fellow asian-american authors, who gets to deliver the most cutting, messy and brutal line of the book:""Who gives a fuck about Athena? Fuck Athena. We all hated that bitch. This is for me.""but what happens after?we get a prediction from june, which is basically that the cycle of controvery and scandal that this whole book has shown us for however many hundreds of pages will just keep going, and going, and going, and maybe june will win (at least in her eyes). it\'s just such a nothing ending. sure, it\'s #commentary and a criticism of the publishing and media industry, but that does not make it satisfying. it\'s not an emotional resolution, and it\'s not even a more sophisticated commentary on the cyclical nature of scandal and how white people don’t face consequences than what the story has shown us already. we\'veseenthe cycle and her getting away with it. the whole book so far has been the cycle and her getting away with it. i think it\'s a good example of what i\'ve been saying, to be honest, about how yellowface is more about The Point than any story it\'s trying to tell. The ending is all about The Point, but is not an emotional resolution to anything developed or a conclusion to any charater arcs. just ""and this will continue, because doesn\'t it always continue? isn\'t this ending so clever?"" the worst part is that itteasesyou with the prospect of something more compelling: june plays with the idea of \'accidentally\' killing candace and knowing she would get away with it because she\'s a white woman, a horrific mirror to the start of the book and a sign of june\'s complete downward spiral, because at least Athena\'s death was an actual accident (and would be a frankly brutal commitment to the “they always get away with it” message). in a different moment, it makes you wonder if june may even be the one who might die an accidental death and now candace is the one to continue this twisted cycle, a horribly circular but somewhat karmic ending. instead, the cycle continues... in the most uninspired way possible. the third act of yellowface feels like it\'s hurtling towards a great ending and then face-plants over the finish line at the last minute. despite being a protagonist who is more well-suited for a crash-and-burn ending than any other i\'ve read, juniper song doesn\'t burn. she barely sizzles. and to me, that\'s disappointing.trigger warnings for this book: racism, c slur, suicidal ideation, sexual assaultedit 24/05/2023:unsurprisingly, some people on twitter cannot fucking read, so to clarify some things: 1)i am not white. i am asian,2) I DO NOT CARE THAT JUNE WAS IRREDEEMABLE. I DID NOT WANT A REDEMPTION FOR A RACIST. my main problem was that i found the way yellowface handled its themes came at the cost of other aspects of the story when it should have been making them better. 3) ""[insert criticism here] is literally the whole point of the story omgggg how could you miss the point so bad did you even pass english lit in school etc etc."" personally, i do not enjoy 300 pages of on-the-nose commentary through uncompelling mouthpieces. i especially find it questionable when some of these mouthpieces flatly reflect criticisms the authors has actually received in regards to her previous work. if you do, more power to you! if what i disliked about the book is what you enjoyed about it, well, that\'s just how having an opinion works. i don\'t know what to tell you. i can definitely understand how someone who isn\'t as aware of some of the meta-commentary would have more enjoyment. but i find the response that i ""missed the point"" (to be honest, the writing constantly tries its best to be Desperately Sure You Are Not Missing The Point) that this book is about racism by some white readers when i\'m intimately familiar with racism, both as it pertains to real life and in media, kind of... well. racist.in a way, i guess this book is perfect for booktwitter. a lot of recognisable discourse where the Message and Themes are written out for you in big bold letters, constantly, all the time, throughout the story, just in case you missed it—that way, even your average reading-comprehension-starved twitter user can pick up on it—padded with enough relatable material about being chronically online and plenty of fictional ragebait to distract from a narrative that can’t get its teeth into its own premise and a third act that can’t deliver. target audience acquired.in line with the theme of the book, i’m going to completely steal another reviewer’s words that i can’t stop thinking about.\'the problem with kuang is that, despite a reputation for in-depth research, she refuses to interrogate beyond her scope.\'go read it. and i’d like to add to that: a lot of her most avid readers don’t have the appetite for anything beyond that, either. and take it incredibly personally when at the end of the meal, you’re still hungry.and to be clear, this isn\'t a blanket response to everyone who disagrees with me (i\'ve had interesting conversations with people who do)--just to some people who are determined to take the most uncharitable opinion possible of a frankly lukewarm review.a book can be about an important subject matter and i can still feel it fell short of what it was trying to do. that is not me putting personal attack on the author, the author\'s identity, the subject matter itself, or any readers who enjoyed the book or their identities. i didn\'t even hate the book. i liked parts of it quite a bit. i just wanted more.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '‘Don’t ghosts just want to be remembered?’A book about fucking around and finding out.The question of who should or shouldn’t tell a story has been a hotly debated subject, a discourse that must also recognize the playing field is guided by rules of capitalism in a for-profit publishing industry and a social climate that prods “culture wars” to increase clicks. Still in recent memory are the debates overAmerican Dirt, which sparkedmonths of controversyover white authors using another’s cultural narrative as what many considered “trauma porn,” but also over the publisher’s decision to throw incredible amounts of marketing money at this book when immigration stories by authors living within the culture were being passed over for that novel. R.F. Kuang’sYellowfacesinks its teeth into the world of publishing and the discourses on authenticity through the eyes of June Hayward, a white woman who has taken the draft of a Chinese-American woman’s novel and published it as her own. She will forever be haunted by this choice, like a Lady Macbeth of letters haunted by bloodstains in her attempt to usurp the kingdom. It is a perfect follow-up toBabeland the conversations on how language can be a form of colonialism, though this one has no magical elements like the former. Instead,Yellowfacereads like a scandal unfolding before your eyes and transfixes the reader with all the sick satisfactions that keep us scrolling through social media debates and keep hot takes. Kuang makes us sit with our discomfort, through an excellent choice of an unreliable narrator, and forces us to confront our own opinions on the matter. With a sharp critique on the commodification and consumption of art in publishing and reviewing (even Goodreaders are not spared here), a look at online debates, the self-aggrandizing aspects of social media, and the way artists are pitted against each other as if writing was a competitive sport, Kuang’sYellowfaceasks big questions on authenticity and identity in a society that has reduced the concepts into marketing metrics.I’ll be honest, I read this book in a single sitting. I could not look away, and Kuang’s writing sweeps you up in it’s conversational cadance. While I’ve enjoyed Kuang’s writing previously,Yellowfacefeels very polished and matured, the novel reading with the ease and eagerness of a tell-all memoir, which is the framing of the story. As a fictional memoir, it drops a lot of pop culture references to key into a specific time. Kuang’s choice of perspective through June—who rebrands at the request of her publisher as Juniper Song, Song being her middle-name but also nudges readers to think she may have Chinese heritage—is brilliant as it allows us to feel the floor-dropping-out discomfort of becoming the focus of internet rage as well as navigate a vigorous criticism of the publishing industry. Kuang is able to cover issues without moralizing, making the reader sift through alternating opinions that are likely to expose their own assumptions and discomforts, and we must always remember the telling is often guiding us away from judging her and towards everyone else. With a big confession at the center, June can manipulate the reader on smaller issues and in a way it becomes a rather metafictional approach to the way storytelling is just that: fictionalizing stories.Kuang does well by creating a character that isn’t entirely unsympathetic—we need to want to keep reading her take on the events—and hate reading is a shallow effect that evaporates quickly. Not unlike the social media scandals that hit viciously and are forgotten days later. Not that June is innocent, and being disgusted with her is half the fun, but Kuang will force us to consider what exactly it is that disgusts us and what that means in a larger context about art and the commodification of it. We’ve seen these sorts of scandals, such as a personal favorite bizarre tale of Natalie Beach who wrote about beingthe ghostwriter for Caroline Calloway, or last year’sWho Is the Bad Art Friend?article concerning Sonya Larson and Dawn Dorland where everyone seemed to be too thrilled by the mess to not pick a side. Though the story that seems closest toYellowfaceis the one surroundingKristen Roupenian’s short storyCat Person(you canread it here) which was defended then later attacked whenan article revealing the details was taken from a strangers real life, told to the author by the man who was fictionalized in the story as the sex pest and later committed suicide in real life. Twitter was full of well-known authors debating if personal details and stories of others are always fair game, even though the hometown and place of employment of the girl was not changed for the published version (my college roommate later rented the house Roupenian had previously lived in and describes in story). Literary twitter was confronted with a situation about what level of authenticity is appropriate and can someone tell someone else’s story.The way social media fuels a fire is at the heart of this story, with twitter challenging authenticity and morals at all times. Which becomes a tragic interplay at the way authors are demanded to be vulnerable, to seek authenticity and expose their pain for book sales, yet social media loves to exploit personal details and use vulnerabilities as an opening for an attack.‘dozen, maybe hundreds, maybethousandsof strangers are out there, mining your personal information, worming their ways into your life, looking for ways to mock, humiliate, or worse, endanger you. You come to regret everything you’ve ever shared about yourself…because the trollswillfind them.’We’ve all most likely criticized a stranger on social media, sometimes the pile-ups are too fun and humorous to not get a joke in, but Kuang tries to remind us that the targets are real people with real feelings. Sure, June deserves to be exposed and feel bad for what she’s done, but Kuang puts us in her shoes and lets you feel what being a target is like. Because it can come for anyone, even Athena was once the target of harassment, death threats and hacking where she didn’t feel safe all for being called a ‘race traitor’ for dating a white man. ‘In destroying her,’ June narrates the voice of social media, ‘we create an audience we create moral authority for ourselves.’ Such is the nature of social media in the state of a scandal, and all for what? ‘Allegations get flung left and right, everyone’s reputations are torn down, and when the dust clears, everything remains exactly as it was.’ Nothing changes, but, as we see in the novel, much of this is because someone profits from it. A scandal often turns into book sales (for all the complaintsAmerican Dirtwas canceled it still remained a bestseller for months) and if you keep selling books you keep getting published.‘The living are burdened with bodies. They make shadows, footprints.’But lets move to the scandal at hand. Here we have June, who has a tepid friendship with rising literary star Athena Liu. She feels jealous as well as annoyance with Athena, fantasizing how she’d like to ‘neatly peel her skin off her body like an orange and zip it up over myself,’ something she is soon metaphorically doing when she edits the now deceased Athena’s manuscript: a WW1 novel about Chinese laborers. It starts off innocently enough (or so June claims) being an exercise in editing that she gets so caught up in loving writing again that she passes it off as herself. It is titledThe Last Front, is praised for a mosaic storytelling style reminiscent of the filmDunkirkand becomes an instant bestseller. She will spend the novel fiercely defending she has the right to tell this story—sometimes being rewarded such as when speaking at a Chinese American Social Club she is thanked by a man who’s Chinese father fought in the war for making sure their stories are told—yet at the end of the day, this never was her story. And while she can be a great writer, we see she is never able to come up with her own ideas and the ones she have is derivative of other stories. It is a subtle and clever nod to a gap between being a good writer and being a good author or creator (an offer to write for existing IP disgusts her, perhaps because she is confronted by what she doesn’t want to admit is her strength).‘It all boils down to self-interest…If publishing is rigged, you might as well make sure it\'s rigged in your favor.’While the marketing grab here is definitely the idea of colonizing another’s work and culture and passing it off as your own (there are many moments for readers to fist bump the novel and say “HAHA take that shit, “Junie””) Kuang makes this a symptom of a larger issue. In her acknowledgements, Kuang states that the novel is a ‘horror story about loneliness in a fiercely competitive industry.’ If your ears perked up at horror story, therearesome horror elements late in the novel (though perhaps not enough and it could have been threaded in longer, if I have one complaint it is that the novels episodic feel never quite let individual elements breathe enough and makes the last portion feel a bit like going one step more than needed instead of flowing from the book which would have sidestepped that feeling? Maybe thats just me though). But loneliness does permeate this tale, and we see how authors can feel crushed under the way for-profit publishing makes it a competition who awards winners and losers. One author will get a huge deal and seemingly inexhaustible marketing, while another gets one small print run and no publisher support. Kuang looks at publishing as a rigged enterprise, with a small team of (mostly white) executives deciding what gets sold and more or less deciding what will be a bestseller and informing readers to follow suit. Its not a secret that publishers buy space in chain bookstores or that the Big 5 US publishers are80% of all publishing revenue. It is a market based on profit, and will be manipulated to ensure profits keep coming.‘This industry is built on silencing us, stomping us into the ground, and hurling money at white people to produce racist stereotypes of us.’To June, however, she sees diversity as a problem, thinking she is passed over for authors like Athena because it looks good. Which, if we look at the publishing market, shows that about75% of published authors in the US are whiteand a 2020 study showed95% of all books published were by white authorsthe previous year.Now everyone probably remembers 2020 was the year many corporations made pledges to be better at diversity, the publishing industry under extra scrutiny as Black authors and anti-racism books were topping the best sellers and showing there was indeed a market for such books, but lets look at the industry itself. Since then,a recent survey shows only a 1% changein the industry, with it being 83% white and that most non-white hires since 2020 are for marketing positions. Which is using “diversity” as a sales technique again.So what June see’s as a fast-track to success is actually a steep uphill climb. ‘""Do you know how much shit Athena got from this industry?’ a character remarks late in the novel, ‘They marked her as their token, exotic Asian girl. Every time she tried to branch out to new projects, they kept insisting that Asian was her brand, was what her audience expected.’ To be a brand is what publishing reduces identity into is the argument seen in the novel. And, if one is reduced to being a brand of themselves, they are now in market competition. I think of author Brandon Taylor saying identity becomes a marketing pitch, and howReal Lifewas reviewed as about identity when he says it was about lonely that happened to have explorations of identity in the book. I\'m reminded of thereasons authors pushed against #OwnVoiceslabels asBecky Albertallifelt forced to come out to ""justify"" her book and others felt boxed in by it.‘Do you know what it\'s like to pitch a book and be told they already have an Asian writer? That they can\'t put out two minority stories in the same season? That Athena Liu already exists, so you\'re redundant?’Kuang examines how the idea of being a brand exists in the outskirts of publishing as well. We have the twitter fights where people exist as a self-brand of being antagonists, we have goodreads reviewers where their brand is taking down popular authors (some lines that may sting are remarks from other authors to not read goodreads and harsh takes are more about feeding ego than worthwhile criticism), and journalists who make a brand at hot takes. However, we have to remember that June is directing us to look at howeveryone elseis the problem instead of her. So while through her telling many of the critiques are cast as villains, the fictional journalist Adele Sparks-Sato (a nod toAndrea Long ChuasVartika pointed out) is not wrong when writing that June’s version of Athena’s novel ‘joins novels likeThe HelpandThe Good Earthin a long line of what I dub historical exploitation novels: inauthentic stories that use troubled pasts as an entertaining set piece for white entertainment.’‘The appropriation of history, the historicization of the past, the narrativization of society, all of which give the novel its force, include the accumulation and differentiation of social space, space to be used for social purposes.’-Edward Said,Culture and ImperialismThere is a good deal of nuance in this book about how the commodification of art is an issue, but also a reminder that we can’t scapegoat our own actions on that entirely. There are some great little jabs in this—Junie Song ordering a Miss Saigon drink only to find it “too sweet” for her tastes—and it does emphasize the problems of representing a different culture from a western lens. AsEdward Saidwrote ‘the power to narrate, or to block other narratives from forming and emerging is very important to culture and imperialism,’ and argued that literature can be a form of colonialism by establishing a perception of a different culture or geography, and in the editing process ofThe Last Frontwe watch June make concessions on the text in order to appeal more to a white reader as requested by her publisher. Yes, she did actually do a great deal of research, and her opinion is the criticisms of cultural issues in the book are ‘exclusive cultural snobbishness and authenticity testing’ that ‘are only a form of gatekeeping,’ though later criticisms of her book are that her misunderstanding of how names or families work, or how her positions on certain issues imply a stance on current Chinese politics that are so beyond her understanding can be harmful. Some readers find it to read as a white-savioir narrative, something we know was manufactured by changing certain characters to be white characters to better fit the market needs. Which also returns us to the idea that art under capitalism will always be in service to profits.Yellowfaceby R.F. Kuang is a delightful novel with the fierceness of an unfolding scandal that makes us confront many key issues hotly debated in the literary world right now. I enjoyed the nuance here in how it exposes problems from many angles, but does not allow that to be an excuse for bad behavior. Understanding is not the same as condoning here, and it is a page-turning trip watching June dip and dodge as her usurped empire continuously threatens to crash down around her. Kuang writes with confidence and precision andYellowfacemakes for an excellent look at the literary world and the commodification of art.4.5/5‘Isn’t that what ghosts do? Howl, moan, make themselves into spectacles? That’s the whole point of a ghost, is it not? Anything to remind you that they’re still there. Anything to keep you from forgetting.’Update: I got to hear R.F. Kuang speak about the book yesterday! She was DELIGHTFUL, discussed why she dislikes how publishing turns identity into marketing metrics, the booksBeautiful World, Where Are You, Ferrante\'s Neapolitan novels and told everyone to readMurderbot. So well spoken, intelligent, and a real wonderful author.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'lmao.the frustration, as always, is that rf kuang is an intelligent and steady-handed writer. she is ahead of many of her peers in craft as much as sales: she writes a page-turner, she crafts a strong perspective, she is horror-writer good at making the reader feel gut-churning revulsion (whether or not she earns the strong emotion she likes to pull out is another question), and in this book she\'s capable of being funny. like here\'s a perfect paragraph, in which our pernicious white heroine works with her editor to chop and change the manuscript she stole:The hardest part is keeping track of all the characters. We change almost a dozen names to reduce confusion. Two different characters have the last name Zhang, and four have the last name Li. Athena differentiates them by giving them different first names, which she only occasionally uses, and other names that I assume are nicknames (A Geng, A Zhu; unless A is a last name and I’m missing something), or Da Liu and Xiao Liu, which throws me for a loop because I thought Liu was a last name, so what are Da and Xiao doing there? Why are so many of the female characters named Xiao as well? And if they’re family names, does that mean everyone is related? Is this a novel aboutincest? But the easy fix is to give them all distinct monikers, and I spend hours scrolling through pages on Chinese history and baby name sites to find names that will be culturally appropriate.like it\'s absolutely executing all of its tricks as it should: the blinkers of a close first person perspective, the legible different reality underneath. it\'s not subtle but when done in satire it\'s not AS hamhanded as kuang\'s dramatic instincts, per other books. readers who know chinese will scream, readers who don\'t will still feel their brain itch. the authorial hand is capable.the author is capable... of more than she writes. the problem with kuang is that, despite a reputation for in-depth research, she refuses to interrogate beyond her scope. in previous books that meant that the sense of history was strong and the rest of the work of writing fiction—character work, plot, tone, anything reliant on the imagination—was comparatively weak. here there\'s no research to hold it up, just kuang\'s own posting habits and career success. the step down from jstor to twitter is a violent stumble.kuang is an accomplished academic but a deeply incurious writer. that is on sharp display here, in a book that is meant to depict success and failure in the literary-commercial circuit—something that kuang knows little about. kuang is a genre writer who achieved crossover commercial success after blowing up on tiktok. her debut was promising and lauded but not uniquely vaunted; she received genre award noms (not wins) but her books blew up on tiktok after the fact and she launched an incredibly successful book this yearin the genre space, off the back of her tiktok fame. everything she knows about succeeding she knows about inside her particular bubble, and also, because she has been succeeding since she was an undergrad baby, has been told—and genuinely believes—that she has hit the summit of success. this leaves her totally inequipped to write about what literary success looks like when engineered by the house. r.f. kuang has no belief that there is a form of publishing greatness beyond that which has been bestowed upon r.f. kuang, and a wilful desire not to google further.the \'publishing details\' on display are... well, they all exist IN publishing, curate a FORM of commercial success, and are familiar to kuang, but they don\'t match the book as described here (a lit-commercial wwii doorstopper, written by a chinese-american author and butchered into commercial sentimentality by a white author and editor, think the bulletproof success of american dirt even in the thick of its cancellation). mainstream literary successes don\'t come up through pitchwars. mainstream commercial novels don\'t come up in most book box deals because there is a form of literary success that is not reliant on superfans buying multiple copies apiece. there\'s a part where our heroine lists the major american literary awards her major literary-commercial war novel is up for and starts with: the goodreads choice awards. posting FROM this bad website: please be serious. it\'s fitting that the cover looks more like a designed arc than like a book.there\'s a note in the babel prologue that i think about all the time with kuang\'s work, where she says that she was so dazzled by the sight of an oyster tower at a particular oxford party that she put it in the book even though oysters in victorian england were trash food for peasants—she didn\'t want to capture the dazzle or the waste so much as she wanted to write down her experience beat for beat, and could not conceive of an emotional reality that she did not personally live. this is an oyster tower book. this is embarrassing and technically inaccurate mimesis all the way down, solely interested in kuang\'s own interests. wow your heroines live in dc? and you lived in dc? they met at yale? you go to yale? omigod rebecca that\'s so crazy. there was a shorthand term back in the sporking days (i know, i hate my withered hag fingers for typing this too) on LIVEJOURNAL (HAG FINGERS) called \'pepper jack cheese\' that was like ""hermione ate a sandwich with pepper jack cheese (a/n: that\'s my favorite cheese!)"", the phenomenon where the author would gigglingly and obviously insert a few of their real-life favorite things into the story. kuang\'s pepper jack cheese is whistlepig whiskey, name-dropped bafflingly twice as a signifier for the nicest possible whiskey, and also every single detail.it is like. skin-crawlingly secondhand embarrassing to watch an author write their own life beat for beat and also be like \'everyone hated her because she was TOO pretty and TOO smart\'. every critique that has ever been leveled against kuang goes into the mouth of her proxy\'s haters, including the pernicious and grasping white heroine. the belief that her haters are racist comes in a distant second to the belief that her haters are jealous—of her success, of her telegenic prettiness, of her comfortable life. maybe baby but look at the material: there\'s room for improvement. it is disappointing to watch someone technically skilled grind their intellectual curiosity down to a nub via posting and self-obsession, and it\'s humiliating to watch an oxbridge-ivy phd student say \'talk to the hand! and DON\'T tell me to log off\' for three hundo pages. is this the best she can do? does SHE think this is the best she can do? i\'m worried that she does.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Whew child. Some of these reviews are doing exactly what Kuang was pointing out throughYellowface. It’s interesting to watch it happen in real time. While I don’t have extensive knowledge of her work, I think what Kuang is doing in this book is actually quite brilliant.At the most basic of levels,Yellowfaceis a mash of various genres that follows the passive aggressive “friendship” of Athena and June, two authors in the publishing industry with very different levels of success. Athena has received her big break while June has remained a struggling author. In an absurd (truly absurd if I’m being quite honest haha) turn of events, Athena chokes while engaging in a pancake eating contest with June. After her death, June makes the decision to steal one of her manuscripts and pass it off as her own. What follows next is chaotic descent into the world of publishing and the book community.What Worked:SO MUCH OF THIS BOOOK WORKED! I’ve seen the countless criticisms of Kuang inserting herself too much into this book as well as the criticisms that indicate that there isn’t much to be gained from reading this book. I wholeheartedly disagree. Oh, my friends, there is much to be gained. Neither of the characters is likeable and that is INTENTIONAL. This isn’t a way to illustrate that everyone in publishing is selfish, but a means to question how much the reader falls into the trap of engaging with the model minority myth. The expectation that Athena is supposed to be likeable is deeply woven in the sociological phenomena that stereotypes many Asian communities as successful, smart, likeable, diligent, docile, etc and the idea that Athena doesn’t fit into that role has made some readers feel uncomfortable whether it is consciously or subconsciously.Kuang’s evaluation of the publishing industry is layered and forces both publishing and the bookish community to do some reevaluation. What she singlehandedly captures in this book has been the biggest criticism that many of us have been vocal about since 2020. Publishing used the death of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement to claim to want more diversity and has in some ways published more diverse books; however, have we really paid attention to what those stories have centered? Trauma versus joy. So many of these stories have been centered on generational trauma, books that are used to educate and make the White masses feel better about not knowing much about diverse experiences prior to 2020. Marginalized voices in publishing are “permitted” to be a part of the community as long we play the roles that we are supposed to play. Once we begin to infiltrate the industry too much, those same people with “BLM” in their twitter bios, the same people who claim to be liberal do the same damn mental gymnastics June did to excuse her behavior. The system was designed for June to do what she did and the moment that marginalized communities “steal” the shine, it’s okay to push back because as June believes she’s the true minority and oppressed person in all of this. Don’t believe me, you should check out the TikTok made by an author who claims that white writers now get turned down because all agents want are BIPOC writers. Or better yet, just listen to foolishness that was uttered from James Patterson who had the audacity to state the White men are the truly oppressed writers in the industry.And let’s take this a step further and look at how Kuang illustrated the danger that publishing has ultimately created with it’s use of terms like #ownvoices. Athena wasn’t ever allowed to write outside of trauma. She’s pigeonholed into only writing one thing. And honestly, I’m sure that happens more than we would like to believe. Authors who want to explore something outside of their “assigned” roles either get turned down or the marketing is trash. It delves deeper into the question of who is allowed to tell what story? Was Athena any better of a fit to tell the story of Chinese laborers of WWI than June? Is research enough to tell something outside of one’s lived experience? These are things to think about and something that we are confronted with every day in this community. Think about books likeAmerican DirtandMemoirs of a Geisha.This book is both absurd and unhinged because so is publishing and the book community. And I’ve been involved in all of it for so many years. Kuang told ya’ll to kiss her ass with this book. She is behaving in the complete opposite manner that is “expected” of her as young, thin, conventionally beautiful Asian woman. And the fact that she owns that shit makes so many people feel uncomfortable. And quite frankly I applaud her for that. BIPOC writers and creators are tired of the expectation that we are supposed to behave, create, write, and provide educational pieces in way that makes others feel comfortable. We’re supposed to applaud White people for the amazing work they’ve done in “allowing” us to enter the spaces and “give” us the opportunity to tell “our stories.” It’s laughable at this point and while ya’ll give Kuang these 1 and 2 star reviews, she’s going to be laughing her pretty, thin, and educated ass all the way to the damn bank.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'If publishing is rigged, you might as well make sure it’s rigged in your favor.4.5 stars. Holy shit, I had an absolute blast reading this! I inhaled it in a day. Forgive me if I make no sense because I stayed up late to finish it!To be honest, I wasn\'t going to readYellowface. I found Kuang\'sBabelto be so painfully boring and didactic, like reading a textbook, that I thought we were parting ways for good. But then it seemed like everyone I know read this and liked it, so curiosity got the better of me.And, wow, is this really the same author? What a ride. The suspense! The vitriol! The fucking audacity!I want to take a moment to acknowledge something I found quite ironic-- Kuang\'s other books are fantasy books about magic and colonialism and boarding schools while this one has the very lukewarm premise of being about authors and the publishing process... but, my god, when it comes to pageturners evenThe Poppy Warhad nothing on this.A satire, is it? Well, maybe, but I\'ve never read such a gripping and suspenseful satire. Kuang rips the publishing industry to shreds with this book, and she does it from the perspective of a white author who steals the first draft manuscript of a dead Chinese author.I sat open-mouthed pretty much the entire time wondering if she was going to get away with it or get caught. Kuang uses a lot of social media to tell this story and it is highly effective at keeping the pacing up. We all know social media is a shitstorm of people vying for attention, performing for validation and, occasionally, making genuinely important points, and we see it all play out here to the extreme.I thoughtBabellacked nuance, butYellowfaceis the complete opposite. Both June and Athena are complex characters. Athena is not allowed to simply be the perfect victim and, in fact, what emerges over the course of the novel is someone who is quite unlikable herself. June has done something objectively bad, but the author resists the temptation to paint her as one-dimensional. Her desperation and self-delusion, her anxiety and her jealousy, feel real.At first glance, June appears to be the villain, but I think it becomes clear as the story progresses that this is much bigger than June. Kuang calls out the publishing industry and the messed up way books are primarily marketed through a social media performance. The young authors choking on their jealousy as they are pitted against one another. The agents and editors urging authors to publish “anything” while they have “social capital” regardless of whether it’s good or not.And, of course, the way many in the publishing industry view ""diversity"" as a marketing buzzword to sell more books, rather than having the genuinely noble goal of diversifying literature. As Brett, June\'s agent, admits at one point:""But at the end of the day all that really matters is cash flow.""This is a chaotic, highly-frustrating, impossible-to-put-down book. I rollercoasted from emotion to emotion reading it and I\'m sure I will still be talking about it long after I\'m done writing this review.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is a compelling, cynical, and thought-provoking satire that delves into themes of plagiarism, racism, and internet trolling. It offers a realistic portrayal of the publishing industry within the framework of a heart-pounding thriller. The story revolves around an anti-heroine driven by power and insecurity, who assumes the identity of her deceased friend to publish a masterpiece. Loneliness and the desperate desire for recognition serve as driving forces, pushing the protagonist to extreme measures.Remarkably, I found myself attached to a book despite disliking the main character. At times, I wished I could physically enter the story and confront June Hayward/ Juniper Song, who committed the ultimate crime: stealing her late friend Athena Liu\'s unpublished book. The reasons behind this act of creative theft are complex and include jealousy, thirst for power, honoring her friend\'s work in the best way possible, and seeking personal gain. It is a tale that explores unfairness, harbored resentment, and a thirst for karmic justice.One of the standout aspects of the book is the author\'s astute commentary on the perils faced by writers, such as internet trolls who use their freedom of speech rights to berate and belittle their creations. The story skillfully examines the commodification of writers, where their looks, personality, color of their skin and online presence become as important as their writing itself.This book truly blew my mind. I was unable to put it down, yet also needed to take breaks due to the chaotic and anxiety-inducing experience of living within Juniper\'s mind. The character evokes strong emotions, including frustration towards her misogyny, blind ambition, and obnoxious justifications for her actions.It is worth noting that Juniper is not the sole antagonist in the narrative. The judgmental and self-righteous individuals surrounding her also exhibit misogynistic tendencies and relish in criticizing and witnessing the downfall of others, all while raising their champagne glasses in celebration. Even Athena, portrayed as socially awkward and naive, adds depth to the story as a potential soul-sucking character for a gripping plotline.In this book, nobody is a saint, as being good-hearted does not guarantee financial security, career success, fame, or power. The author skillfully portrays flawed and complex characters who challenge the reader\'s perceptions.Overall, this realistic and thrilling read left me feeling anxious and evoked a multitude of emotions including fear, hate, and sadness. It successfully accomplished its mission of shaking the reader to their core and provoking deep thoughts that linger for days. The essence of a masterpiece lies in its ability to challenge readers and evoke a range of feelings, and this book achieves just that.I wholeheartedly consider this one of the best books of the year, and I urge you not to overlook it or let it languish in your ""to be read"" list.

You write 'em, I read 'em. And the ones I like best tend to be a little bit tongue-in-cheek and satirical, inviting you to see the world through the plagiarist's eyes. After all, they're not really bad people, are they? They see a story that needs telling, and they're the ones to tell it. So what if the story isn't theirs to tell in the first place?And soYellowfaceenters that arena with its own take on this eyebrow-raising topic. And right off the bat, I'm intrigued. June is an interesting plagiarist-protagonist. She starts off as a writer struggling for relevance, and that struggle is something we can all relate to. It's not as if she decides to become a plagiarist overnight. No, it's a slippery slope of small decisions, each one understandable on its own, that ultimately lands her in such an ignoble profession.Once I started, I couldn't put it down. June's voice is as compelling as it is grotesque, and it's hard to look away from such self-inflicted catastrophe. You know this isn't going to turn out well, and yet she just keeps going. The best satires always elicit a lot of wincing, and that definitely happened here.I don't mind telling you guys that this story made me uncomfortable. And I'm sure that is R.F. Kuang's intention. June isn't some crazy thief, at least not initially. Rather, she's drawn as this morally ambiguous, somewhat sympathetic character. In fact, from certain angles, she looks almost downright reasonable, making the best of what she's got. And this sly characterization leaves the reader both fascinated and uneasy, for we feel drawn towards June even though she is the villain of this tale. And that cognitive dissonance stays with us throughout.The first half of the book was particularly strong for me because of that perfect balance between hero and antihero. There's a lot of subtlety that allows June to be both appealing and repulsive. However, once we get to June's book release and her subsequent guilt and justification, it does start to take on more and more of a crazed tinge, and as a result, lost a lot of the subtlety that made the first half so compelling for me.There is a lot packed into this little story: racial commentary, inside look at being a writer and the publishing industry, internet trolling, cultural appropriation. And it's all done seamlessly. I have to applaud the author for both not being afraid to wade into these interesting topics, as well as saying something of substance about each of them.What a fascinating story this turned out to be. Subversive and uncomfortable, it really drew me in and kept me glued to the pages. If you're looking for something that's both eminently readable and also leave you a lot to think about, this is it.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'i\'m being generous already when i say that it is OK, because i personally do not like these kinds of books. while i appreciate the social commentary and the look inside the publishing industry, i found the tone and execution quite heavy-handed.it\'s certainly well-written, but personally i didn\'t like the writing style or the narrative voice. i know rfk intended the characters to be unlikeable, but i did not root for them at any point of the book. i was irritated most of the time, so i can\'t really say that i enjoyed reading this. i\'ve read my fair share of books peopled with unlikeable characters, but this one here is just unbearable and repetitive. it got so boring the last third of the book that i had to take a nap before continuing.i think my main problem is that the author\'s personal voice bleeds through the text and does not give the reader much room to think. rfk frames the story in a way that clearly shows the readers what she thinks and, in a way, she\'s telling us what to think. in tpw i excused it as a debut author\'s mistake, while in babel i found her passion about the themes charming— but here in yellowface i realize that rfk is unfortunately incapable of separating her own voice from the text, which is very grating to my brain. i won\'t get into the specifics, but it\'s just SO irritating to read. it\'s satirical and supposed to be ""darkly funny"" but i guess i just did not understand the jokes (wherever they may be). i also think that i would have appreciated the book more had it cut back on the pop culture references (which i do not think will age well btw). i would have liked this more had it been written with more finesse and subtlety.anyway, i don\'t think rfk is cut out to write in this genre.ARC received in exchange for an honest review'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""At this point I'd read Rebecca's grocery lists“She’s using the pen name Juniper Song to pretend to be Chinese American.

This is a book worthy of discussion. It has both blatant and nuanced themes of racism and xenophobia that might go over some reader\'s heads or might seem too in-your-face for others. A group discussion can help reader\'s recognize the realism of R.F. Kuang\'s literary approach and see that even if you don\'t relate to the content, you still have to understand that it\'s other people\'s reality.Will you enjoy a single character? Categorically NO. But you will walk away with a greater understanding of the many failings of the publishing industry and how you might be unconsciously taking part in some of those failings.It\'s eye opening. It\'s ballsy. It\'s crass. It\'s wild and brilliant.I will say that the half star reduction is solely because of Candice. While her insistence upon sensitivity reader\'s was a good call in my opinion, her manner of calling things out and getting things done were over-dramatized to the nth degree. While I think R.F. Kuang is brilliant for having the opposing side of June also be contrarian, Candice didn\'t fill the spot I wanted her to in opposition to June. I know it wasn\'t a character to necessarily root for instead of June. But I saw June\'s motives and her horrible mental manipulation that she attempted to gaslight ourselves into believing were just. But Candice just felt cartoonishly villainous. Maybe that\'s just my view of her. Other\'s could read it differently.But, overall, this is absolutely worth your time. Please read this. It is a shining gem in the 2023 literary world.March 2023 ⭐️4.5RF Kuang DID THAT.This woman fears nothing and no one. What a hero.She said ""Talk about the publishing industry? How about the racism, misogyny, xenophobia, plagiarism, pretty-privilege and everything else revolting that comes along with it? You don\'t want to acknowledge that? Welp, too bad. Cause I\'m gonna write it so well, you\'ll be begging to publish it.""I thought that RF Kuang was going to write about her experience with publishing through the eyes of the main character. But that\'s the direct opposite approach she takes. Her self-insert is actually with Athena, the main character\'s college friend turned renowned author.The main character is a depiction of mild mannered racist individuals who shroud themselves in acceptance as long as it doesn\'t affect them and balk at the idea of racism until directly faced with equality and the loss of superiority it gives them.This is an excellent look at how real and deep rooted racism is. It\'s everywhere and in everyone. It just isn\'t always shouting it\'s ideals. It\'s sitting still while someone else does something harmful. It\'s deluding yourself when you get the job over someone of color when you know you\'re under qualified. It\'s in so many small and micro ways. And it\'s absolutely vile to watch/read. But very eye opening in a way that I think is necessary for the publishing industry as it stands.I so appreciate RF Kuang for writing this and continuing to be an absolute genius. Like, how does a human being\'s brain contain this much complexity and eloquence? I\'m baffled.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'with some personal favourites like‘the plot,’ ‘a ladder to the sky,’and‘kill all your darlings,’im no stranger to a plot about plagiarism. but what makes this book stand out from the others is its hard hitting commentary about the publishing world.RFK is a fantastic writer and skillfully navigates the loneliness and pressure authors feel, making the drastic decisions juniper makes feel somewhat morally grey rather than outright wrong (as we know plagiarism is). and even though its done in a satirical way (which isnt my favourite), i enjoyed the exploration of topics like authors in reader spaces, own voices stories, and the different standards and treatment of white vs minority authors.the only reason this isnt getting 5 stars is because of a personal problem. i have a really weird pet peeve of real world things mentioned in fiction. i like realistic/contemporary stories, but pop culture references bug the crap out of me. so all of the talk of US politics and presidents, very real famous authors, even the commentary about goodreads and tiktok, took me out of the story.so, a little too “real world” for my personal reading preferences, but there is no doubt this is a provocative novel that sheds light on various aspects of the book world.↠4 stars'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4.5R.F.

It was so in-depth into the industry it made my heart sing and despare at the same time (as a publishing post-graduate first and then as a compulsive reader part of the online community). It managed to highlight a slew of things that make publishing not such a great place to be at in very few pages and I'm amazed. To me this book kind of felt like a very long article but with twists and turns. Now I know why they released arcs so early (looking at you, HarperCollins 👀). Book twitter will have a field day with this one...What a choice to have the main narrative voice be the plagiarizer (and in first person at that).Both Athena and June are awful people, and I love that neither of them is a saint, but reading the entire thing from June's pov? Insane. She's a frustrating character, not gonna lie, but she's also deliciously realistic as a two-faced, self-absorbed and dishonest manipulator that always has an excuse ready. She goes out of her way to say to the reader that she wants to do something for poc every chance she gets, but the reality is that she's a bitch trying to profit from it all in an industry that lets her do it. Sometimes it's subtle, sometimes it's not too difficult to miss her slipping into a plain wrong mentality and lol, basic whiteness.You think you're safe as the external reader? Not a chance.I'm not proud to say I fell straight into R.F. Kuang's trap, because was I seriously rooting for such a cheater the entire time? This book brainwashed me into supporting someone who stole a whole manuscript immediately after witnessing the author's death and reaching stardom by publishing it as her own. I got to the point where I was scared she was going to get caught and hoped she would get out of it unscathed.My brain ignored all the red flags and procedeed to scam me until the very end.I mean, of course I ended up wishing she would kill someone to shut them up. Of course I got second-hand anxiety from her messing up with her publishing team and at her events. Of course I cared about her mental health. Am I okay or what? Is it time for me to get theraphy too?On the other hand, Athena is harder to grasp.You really need to have the whole picture with her, which you only get by reading the book till the end.I loved the way RFK slowly built her character. You only read about her from June's perpective when she's already dead and still she comes through as the main character, not less because June is literally obsessed with her. Well-written toxic friendships are my bread and butter and the one in here was one of my favorites. The way it was dealt with: nothing less of spectacular. I found June's morality to be the most interesting aspect of this book, but the relationship between her and Athena comes in second for sure.Much care went into the secondary characters too.Even when they only fully appeared once or twice, they always had a well-rounded story behind them.I can apply that specifically to the publishing team and Geoff. From that last one it's again apparent and so on-the-nose how me and RFK's morally grey characters just work together. What can I say? I'm fascinated with them. Geoff reminded me of so many white male authors on twitter but he just had a pull. I loved that he was so pathetic, that I never knew what he was going to do and then, when I least expected it and as naturally as possible, he showed a completely different side to himself.There are a couple of things I didn't completely enjoy, mainly the pop culture references (way too many, half of them were necessary, the others not so much), and the ending.Overall the ending itself wasn't bad, I loved how it wrapped up, but that final showdown bordered on cartoonish and because of that it was hard to take it seriously. I also feel like the final chapter is missing, although I understand what this novel is actually supposed to be (have I said meta already?).In conclusion, an amazing foray into general fiction by R.F. Kuang. I swear this woman can do no wrong. Give her whatever topic to write about and I bet she can create something incredible out of the most boring premise.I think it's impressive how she took these modern controversies and wrote them into a twisty unputdownable story.It seems to me like it's a new experiment from her but at the same time a really smart jab at publishing too.I wouldn't say it's a perfect book and I'm unsure if I would reread it likeThe Poppy Wartrilogy; however I can't exclude it won't live in my mind rent free as I still catch myself heavily thinking about it.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Oh, Booktwitter, Bookstagram!

Some of it was interesting.I will clarify a few things.If you write a negative review, you are not supposed to tag the author.While the internet may seem like The Wild West, GoodReads does have Community Guidelines. They state, ""Criticizing the opinions of others is permitted, but attacking individuals for their opinions is not.""Personally, I have never had a problem with an author, publisher, or GoodReads so you can write negative reviews (just make sure not to violate the Community Guidelines).This book does bring up some interesting points around who gets to tell certain stories and plagiarism.I found this issue of plagiarism particularly ironic because Yellowface didn\'t strike me as very original, essentially a mashup ofThe Plot by Jean Hanoff KorelitzandThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L Frank Baum. Furthermore, RF Kuang had a scene inThe Poppy War (published 2018)where the main character was training by carrying a pig up a mountain.Well, there is a story inHoles (published 1998)by Louis Sachar where someone carries a pig up a mountain.However, people create retellings all the time. There are lots of familiar and time-tested tropes and plots. At what point is it plagiarism?

Those villainised hacks who never see how what they\'re doing is wrong. They\'re Karens, but they voted for Biden. No really, June Hayward says she is a Democrat, and liberal, and voted for Biden multiple times within the book. Hayward a mediocre author who is friends (and we\'re not really convinced why) with a Chinese American literary star Athena Liu who dies suddenly after a pancake goes down the wrong hole, and Hayward is too inept to perform the Heimlich manoeuvre.After this, Hayward steals Liu\'s manuscript about Chinese laborers forcefully conscripted by the French during World War 1. The caucasity is unsurprising, trite, and racist covering all the beats we experienced every time we covered Discourse about films like The Blindside, Hidden Figures Greenbook, and books like The Help, or American Dirt.This book is not funny, it\'s not particularly well-written, with a literal typo in the first few pagesThe editor who did got fired,. The narrative is repetitive and disjointed, like puzzle pieces forced together from different boxes. There were scenes where June\'s narration is simply exhausting.I have to remind Athena this every single time. She has a goldfish’s memory when it comes to my problems—it takes two or three repetitions for anything to stick.First of all, Rebecca, goldfish don\'t have short memories. Some can keep them for years. Secondly, you already said this multiple times. We aren\'t ""goldfish"", we aren\'t sieves. We don\'t need incessant spoonfeeding about something you already said. In the opening stints, June mentions how her debut was left to languish by her editor at the pathetic imprint that was the only one that gave her a chance. It didn\'t need to be repeated. It also speaks to a certain lack of, perhaps, awareness by Rebecca about how publishing classifies books. When they acquire a manuscript, the books are then delineated, and different budgets are assigned to the books based on what they think will be most profitable. In the current environment, poorly written horny romantasy, AI and climate change scare stories, American POC history and struggle porn, badly written romance, and whatever book Booktok bestows its benevolent virality are the ones most likely to get publishing buzz.Majority of the authors are very white, very North American, or very British. June\'s lack of awareness of how publishing works spoke more to Rebecca\'s ignorance or laziness. And ultimately, her scapegoating of publishing ""wanting diverse stories"" rings hollow. Maybe this story would have been better if June had whitewashed a literary navel-gazing story about vulnerability and identity.Beyond the amateurish prose that suffered from sudden bursts of Thesaurus-itis, for example, on Pg. 6 Rebecca writes,It’s so fucking arbitrary. Or perhaps not arbitrary, but it hinges on factors that have nothing to do with the strength of one’s prose.then on Pg. 102Can\'t we all get behind decrying antimiscegenation?June also says Athena\'s prose is repetitive while her monologues feel like a scratched CD. One could argue that Rebecca is trying to show how June is unaware of her lack of talent but you can\'t help but wonder if she is just a serviceable writer. The book takes pains to be accessible for mass audiences. Rebecca also wants to explain every little detail such as ARCs and sensitivity readers-jargon everyone who is involved in The Community would know. June even goes on a diatribe when discussing a potential movie deal and says,Accessibility matters.and when undressing the stolen manuscript that\'s ""difficult"" to read, she says,It’s distracting from the central narrative. Reading should be an enjoyable experience, not a chore.Is this satire or Rebecca explaining why the prose is so bland and repetitive.My suspension of disbelief was unwilling and abused by how ridiculous some of the events in publishing happen. When June mentions the Goodreads Choice Awards more times than more prestigious ones, I couldn\'t help but wonder if Rebecca doesn\'t understand literary Oscars season or if she was trying to pander to Goodreads Choice Awards voters (this book will definitely be listed under Best Fiction). The GCAs are a popularity contest. Rarely do people read all the books listed, they only vote for what they loved. Additionally, no discerning reader who wants a book about Chinese labourers in WW1 would give a fuck about GCAs.Or is this a 4D chess Trojan horse where readers are actually being unwittingly tested as a focus group? Some people will prefer a female friendship story where race dynamics are explored (The Hate U Give), or perhaps they will want a thriller involving authors and books (Too Close To Home by Linwood Barclay), a meta narrative about who gets to tell a story (Bad Art Friend), a serial plagiariser (look up Jumi Bello), or Asian American nonfiction (Minor Feelings) and Rebecca can pick her next project. Maybe Rebecca is staging herself as the host of the round table to discuss whether authors should interact with reviews. But as we saw with Lauren Hough, the answer is still no.There was also a glaring pattern where June kept pointing out Athena\'s flaws. How she was once the actual bad art friend, how Twitter Hot Take enthusiasts called her a race traitor. But we never get to delve into that because June believesno one is that deep into Chinese history or politics. Great job, Rebecca. You have shut down your critics for the lack of nuance in Asian history and characters in Babel. Athena is so offensively superficially written that I almost wished we had gotten her point of view, as a villain who wants to step on all faces to the top of the literary throne. The few snippets we get of her prose show she\'s a much better writer than June and her narration would have been more palatable than June\'s weapons of mass boredom.There\'s a certain Discourse we\'re supposed to have from this book about Bad White Women, and how publishing serves to silence writers of colour. We also have to discuss who gets to tell certain stories. The problem is, we have spoken about this ad nauseum. So who is this book for? Outsiders who would like to know how it works? Adults who wanted a meta vivisection of this insular world but with Dark Themes?Rebecca doesn\'t know. She says it\'s a thriller examining the idiosyncracies of publishing. It\'s not thrilling. And it has a myopic view of how publishing works. About good intentions that went poorly when June always set out to usurp Athena\'s work from the jump? It\'s not satire. It\'s a reverse Künstlerroman. Why is it necessary? The book doesn\'t tell you because it ends like a flaccid plateau.

Should I call this satire—granted that there is nothing humorous and that I am not particularly strongly exaggerating anything—as I amateurly write prose so unabashedly written in my own voice that it would be impossible to separate any idea from my own? Because that appears to be the direction this book has gone in.I am not the first to say that this reads like RFK\'s notes app consciousness, nor will I be the last. While I will not get into specifics, as this is an incredibly early copy of the book, I will say that anyone who even remotely knows anything about the author will see the similarities between them and...certain things. Now, I have no issue with an author writing from experience.\'Write what you know\'is both an incredibly popular and successful piece of advice given to wannabee-writers. Butfuck,at some point one has to wonder about the motivation behind it.Simply put, because there is no other way to put it, this book felt like a circle-jerk. I should have expected such a thing from a satire on the publishing industry written by a prominent figure within it. It is typical—of course they will ridicule things like social media and how the masses view them. Of course they will glower at criticisms and mock fellow authors. Is that not the purpose of satire? But this feels like so much more than that. Instead, I feel as if RFK is speaking to me in a jest. Like she is pointing toward the book community, head cocked to the side, cheekily winking in our shared knowledge of their ridiculousness. Her eyes say,look at them—look at their silliness and their worries and their jealousy. See how they behave like animals, that group of people outside of our circle.Like she\'ll laugh right after, content in her knowledge that she lives in an absurd space, and that only we understand its absurdity.My first tip-off—no, not my first, though perhaps the most obscene—is how she uses our untrustworthy protagonist. RFK is, without a doubt, excellent at writing bad people. I have never argued against this, and I rather think I never will. But in this way, I feel almost uncomfortable when her unlikable characters serve the role of real people. She mocks criticism she has received in the past for her very real, non-fictitious books, through these characters. It feels, once again, like a terrible inside joke I have been privy to. As if the reader is meant to read these and think,these ridiculous characters! To say such things as this!And yet when one is aware of the author\'s actual past, it becomes...awkward. That is, she is not an author of subtlety. The satire could not work because it was not sufficiently...anything! I did not find it funny, nor was it so exaggerated as to be comical.The writing in general did not work for me.Babel,for all of its long-winded sentences and unending paragraphs of description, felt like a declaration of loyalty to words. This book, instead, felt like it was made by someone who could not care less for such things. This is, I understand, literary fiction. RFK has gone out of her normal bubble of fantasy to try something new, and I truly commend her for it. But I must question if this is the right genre for her. She is blunt and uncouth, neither of which are particularly bad—nor do I even dislike it—but which are painfully obvious throughout this. I felt like I was reading one of those High School creative writing class exercises (something which I actually do on a daily basis) where the young, inexperienced creator feels the need to say things like ""but you\'ll never guess what happens next"" and ""this is something that\'ll come up later"" in their first point of view narrative as if the reader is not skillful enough to gradually realize such things later on. Its modernist setting equally paid a part in this. There are only so many times you can name-drop an author or celebrity or, God-be-damned, fucking Harry Potter before realizing you have written something that reads like a Buzzfeed quiz. No, the narration did not work for me, nor did I think that any of it ultimately paid off in its strange and wholly random ending I can only describe as, ""really?""I struggle to find the words to end this. I\'m afraid I have run out of other people\'s thoughts to steal as I reword them into my own. I want to clarify that I do like the author\'s other works. Out of the five books of hers I\'ve read (all of her works except for that one anthology she worked on), I\'ve really liked and sometimes loved three of them. But that doesn\'t mean I\'m not capable of thinking that this was not her best genre, nor her best work by any means. This book felt like the worst possible self-awareness. The type shared over grins and knowing smiles, wherein both parties are partaking in the mockery of a group of people they think themselves entirely separated from. This is a book that both ridicules authors while falling to its knees, proclaiming its undying devotion to them. Funny enough, I praisedBabelfor a much similar sentiment. But where in that book I enjoyed the constant switch between criticizing the power and history of words to being mesmerized over them,Yellowfacefelt more like a sledgehammer.Love me,it sayslike I love you—all of us—the sophisticated and knowledgeable professionals. Those of us who do not care for the social media mob, for we are above it. Those of us willfully scornful of such things, for if we pretend to each other long enough that we are all on the same page against the absurdist, laughable masses, we might start to believe it.arc received for an honest review'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'I give this book four stars because, one, it’s highly entertaining. For maybe the first fifty pages or so the writing felt a bit dry, though when the plot picks up, I found myself so curious to know: will this white woman who stole an Asian American woman’s work get caught?? Will she confront her own insecurities that led to this? Is Athena actually dead?? R.F. Kuang creates a selfish, self-absorbed main character in June Hayward, with a consistent voice that kept me engaged inYellowface’s story.I also think this book does open up important conversations. Yes, at times it makes its point bluntly/crudely and in an obvious way, though through this satire Kuang raises deeper questions too, such as whether anyone can remain truly ethical or generous in a brutally capitalist publishing industry. I liked how Kuang didn’t make Athena a perfect character because by doing so, she highlights how people of color can engage in problematic and oppressive practices too.So even though I didn’t agree with all of Kuang’s satirical commentary inYellowface(e.g., I think Asian Americans should be asked hard, critical questions about glorifying whiteness both in dating partners and in other areas of life), I respect that she seized a popular topic in the publishing industry and made a novel out of it. The exaggerated nature of satire doesn’t always lend itself to a deeper emotional connection with the characters or the story, though I don’t think a deep emotional connection is necessarily the point of this novel. Overall, while I don’t see this novel breaking into my top ten list at the end of this year, I found it an interesting read and one that may be fun to discuss.*also, just to add, this type of thing is still happening all the time, including in other industries. Recently I saw a white woman publish a research paper on Black and Latinx mothers and when I emailed her and asked about her research practices with these communities, she literally just ignored me. And, as I\'ve written about in at least one other review, one time I gently called in a white woman for doing her dissertation on Asian American women (with no Asian American women as coauthors) and she called me aggressive and ""untrusting."" sigh!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '”Who has the right to write about suffering?”Have you ever read a book that is so timely and effective in its message that you do not feel the slightest bit qualified to review it? That your thoughts on such a masterpiece are not even worthy of being put to paper, literally or figuratively, because they are trite, vapid, and banal in comparison to the quality of the text being discussed? That’s how I feel trying to put the proverbial pen to paper with my thoughts onYellowface.Is this book satire? Obviously and not quite so much. What I mean is, it’s clearly satire, but to an extent that these characters are not exact flesh and blood, but the issues discussed in this book are far from farcical. Most reviewers have noticed the central themes inYellowfacerearing their ugly head in the real world, especially in the past few years, so it is refreshing and exhilarating to read a fictional novel encompassing these issues in a way that onlyR.F. Kuangcould create.”Give me your bruises and hurts, she told us, and I will return to you a diamond.”Let’s be clear: June is not a character that you will feel empathy for. She will not be redeemed, rooted for, or endeared by the end; however, watching her downfall is oddly satisfying in a way that I cannot quite explain. The insight into the process of releasing a book with a Big Five publisher is compelling and intriguing, and it’s, sadly, easy to see how something like this story could transpire. The beauty of this tale is no one is safe from criticism; Kuang makes it clear that there are various forms of privilege that transpire across lines of race, class, gender, etc., and every single character really has something to answer for.In one word:Brilliant.*Many thanks to the publisher for providing my review copy.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I'M CRYING, THROWING UP, RIPPING MY HAIR OUT AND THEN CRYING SOME MORE!Rebecca F. Kuang is THE WRITER of our generation.The author, honestly just like with Babel, had me in the palm of her hand from page 1. And my attention lasted until the very last page. I spent every waking hour thinking about this book, while I was reading it and while I was NOT. I cannot possibly imagine something this good can be written, but it turns out it can, I'm witnessing the magic happen, right?I'm not that hard to please when it comes to my reading, and I give five star ratings (fairly) easily. But it doesn't happen every day that I GO MAD loving a book. That fact speaks for itself.R. F. Kuang doesn't speak with or to you when she writes, she HAUNTS you. It takes a genius to achieve that.She explored every possible aspect or every question you might have, every side you could possibly take on this subject, doesn't leave much room for the reviewer, but I'm not complaining (I like my thoughts planted)PLOT The blurb is short and easy to understand, so i don't feel the need to retell it once more (I know I would do a poor job). I saw that most reviews on here surrounded the issues of the publishing industry as the central theme of this book, but I wouldn't agree. Just like with Babel, the racial debate takes the biggest piece of the cake, just dressed in different icing. But again, I'm not complaining. The book community is rarely not problematic, let's be honest, we are witnessing whitewashing and white supremacy on here every day. So, to not be blind and ignorant, we should learn about the topic EVERY DAY. As a white woman, I wasn't offended with any of the thoughts from this book, and I quite frankly think, that hating it (the story it explores) is an act of racism.BABEL Yeah, it's not one of those 'if you like this you'll like that' situations. This book is different in every aspect, if I hadn't known I wouldn't think it was written by the same person. BUT IT'S EQUALLY AS BRILLIANT. Doesn't that really picture the talent and originality of this writer?CHARACTERS I'm quite possibly the biggest fan of morally ambiguous characters. Especially when they're well written, they amaze and intrigue me. Life is far from black and white, right? I feel like the author inserted bits and pieces of herself in each of the characters, I don't feel like she chose just one. Both are writers and artists, both flawed (chronically unoriginal), but both for sure do have redeeming qualities.Sounds a bit fake, but I genuinely think R. F. Kuang was the right person to tell this story. No matter how many times she REINVENTS herself, the story always feels like it was made just and only for her. I can't wait to read the Poppy War trilogy.In the end, the intended question remains:Would it be the same if a white woman wrote this?💕📖💕(What i wrote before reading)This will make me or break me (I'm so serious)""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Dziś doszłam do wniosku, że Rebecca F.

June\'s internal monologue was absolutely insane, especially in the first half. I didn\'t even know how she could dig herself deeper into the hole, but she never failed to dig herself deeper and deeper. I was left with my jaw dropped at the end of multiple chapters.I really enjoyed the insight into the publishing industry that Yellowface gave as well. One of the sentences that struck me the most was ""Bestsellers are chosen. Nothing you do matters"". I assumed this was often the case, however, it opened my eyes to how much ads and promotions for certain books impact the chance of me reading them.Overall I had such a fun time buddy reading Yellowface withSue!I\'ve heard incredible things about RF Kuang for years, so I am very happy to finally have picked up one of her books. needless to say, I\'ll be reading her entire backlist!'}]"

Jimenez really did make this book worth my time. I would say, having read the second book, this is better in terms of writing and pacing and that is probably what made it connect with me so much 😗Alexis gives off the perfect \'Alexis from schitts creek\' vibes at times because she just had that aura and it made her pov so much more enjoyable. Abby did such a mega job describing Lexi\'s complex life with her family and it made me absolutely furious with how she was treated. Her mother was the definition of a doormat with the way she kept her husband walk all over her and I absolutely hated how Alexis couldn\'t rely on her father and it made feel so bad for her because most girls have this strong bond with their father and that support really means a lot to them because I do see my sisters and I see how much secure they feel knowing that if things don\'t work out my father will support them and to see Alexis quittingn an emotionally abusive relationship with a man who cheated on her btw only to be constantly judged and belittle her into thinking that her ex could never be wrong and she was the one in the wrong hurt 😭 because how can you do that to your own daughter, he was so controlling, he basically made all the important decisions of her life and the worst part was the he wasn\'t even there for the occasions. You know the little moments that you wish to celebrate with your family- yeah Alexis never got that because her dad was an arrogant bitch and her mother a weak doormat.Daniel was perfect and the Greenest flag ever and he was definitely everything Alexis needed. He was the kind of guy who would go out of his way to help others. He was also very passionate about the thing he loved done *cough* Alexis *cough* 😭 no but besides that he actually was. Daniel and his baby goat were the highlight tbh 🤭 I absolutely loved his patience and good he waited for Alexis and created an environment where she felt comfortable!The romance was one of the nicer parts of this book. It was healthy and cute. I liked how it was closed door as well. I think it helped with the angst...I loved slow burn but this one was a one night stand turned into strangers with benefits so I wasn\'t expecting that I just liked that we didn\'t get insta love 😌✋🏻 both of them were so well fit and I totally got where Alexis was coming from because I saw how her parents reacted to her brother\'s gf I knew they would react the same way with Daniel 😔 and I also saw why Daniel felt betrayed but I loved loved loved how they got back together 🤭Overall, it was an amazing read 🩷___Reading this for just for the summer 💫-Abby Jimminez please blow my mind 🙏🏻•Buddy reading withRoxy'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I absolutely loved this story - relatable in so many ways.

Hallelujah!After a series of cynical (and not very fun) reads, what a pleasure it was to spend time with the wholehearted characters Abby Jimenez brought to life in Part of Your World. Just as I was starting to wonder if I’d outgrown the romantic comedy genre, her fourth book (but first for me) helped me realize there’s still some rom and a whole lot of com out there to be enjoyed.Part of Your World takes the opposites attract trope and gives it a good shake-up by (gasp!) making the woman almost 10 years older than the man. That’s right folks, she’s 37 and he’s 28. She’s an ER doctor at a prestigious hospital in Minneapolis, and he’s a carpenter/mayor/B&B manager at a small town called Schitt’s Creek, whoops, I mean Wakan (the Dakota word for “magic”). He wears denim, she wears Dolce & Gabbana. She comes from a family that puts the “greed” in well-pedigreed, and he comes from a self-centered teen mom. Opposites, to be sure.One thing they have in common though is obligation, and it’s those obligations that become the obstacle to their happily ever after. As they wrestle with them (and each other, ifyaknowwhatimsayin), readers are treated to many humorous lines and scenes, a baby goat in pajamas, and a pig named Kevin Bacon.Jimenez has sprinkled a little pixie dust over the story by integrating subtle nods to various fairy tales and Disney movies. Be on the lookout for Cinderella scenes and Little Mermaid moments. Also be prepared for the underlying serious theme of domestic abuse - both emotional and physical. A few of the beauties in this book have dealt with some beasts.Part of Your World might have been slightly more successful for me if it had been a tad less spicy in the s-e-x department, but that’s a personal preference and at least none of the C-words I hate so much were used. There are a few f-bombs, but that’s a-OK in my book. Or should I say world? ;)4.5 starsMy heartfelt thanks to the author and Estelle at Forever for the gifted copy to review.

Real-human-feelings type of impact for a fictional world.I think this book just became the blueprint for what all romances should read like, should feel like.

I don’t want to move on. 😩“But grace costs you nothing.”From the town, to the main characters, to the side characters, I loved every part of it. I was rooting so hard for Alexis and Daniel, it’s not even funny. They’re not even real, but they might as well have been.That speech that Alexis gave towards the end? I can’t tell you how proud I felt. I don’t even know whether she recognised her worth by the end, but I sure as fuck did. The woman is incredible! 🥹And Daniel? Don’t get me fuckin’ started. 😭 Abby Jimenez had no right to create this type of hero. None at all. Cinnamon roll to the core. He was someone that was just sogoodand honourable.

I’m finding words difficult, simply because it wouldn’t do this book justice.So, to end it, my favourite aspect to this book (alongside everything else I’ve already mentioned) boils down to this: I feel like it emphasised that found families can sometimes trump the ones you are born into.*Trigger warnings for emotional/narcissistic abuse from an ex and her parents.There’s also a side character who’s experiencing domestic abuse*'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4.5 Stars ☆""Grace costs you nothing.""This did start off as insta-love, but don\'t let that deter you because I\'m not a fan of it and ended up enjoying this. The story progresses into more, even touching on some heavy real-life topics. This is my first Abby Jimenez book, and she portrayed emotional and mental abuse well, showing the realness of dealing with it.Part of Your World is the first book in the POYW series. It is a small town, age gap(she\'s older 37 and he\'s 28), opposites attract romance with tension, witty banter, laugh out loud moments and scenes of abuse that had me feeling angry and shedding tears.Alexis was on her way home late one night from an out of town funeral when she swereved to miss a raccoon and put her car in a ditch. While she was waiting for the towns tow truck, Daniel stopped to help pull her out. She goes to the only open place in Wakan the towns bar and runs into him there. Deciding to help him win a bet with his friends as a way to thank him.Daniel Grantis thoughtful, generous, and selfless, and I swear he is the sweetest. This man has the biggest heart and will do anything to help those who need it. He had me swooning for him so hard with all the gestures that he did for Alexis. He has his struggles, though, and it mad me so mad to watch him go through them. We see him suffer with financial struggles, but he tries not to show that he is struggling to save one of the things that means the most to him. Guys, he takes care of a baby goat that wears pajamas for a friend, sigh.“I like to read. It’s the only way I get to live somewhere that isn’t Wakan. I read three, four books a week. A lot of audiobooks. That way I can work and read at the same time.”Alexis Montgomeryis smart, sophisticated, and grew up being privileged. She went through both mental and emotional abuse with her ex and didn\'t realize that she deserved better until she met Daniel. My favorite part of Alexis was watching her grow and realize that her own family had also been abusive while growing up. Always doing the things that were expected of her by her parents and doing what truly made her happy but to please them. She started to see it all so clear once she was treated the way that she deserves by Daniel. My heart broke for her so many times, but in the end, she broke away from it and did the things that fit her life for her and not for anyone else.""Nobody can save you until you’re ready to save yourself.”Daniel and Alexisare the complete oppostie of each other. She is an er doctor at a prestigious hospital, and he is the mayor of the town who runs a B&B and is a carpenter. When they are together, though, the sparks fly. They fit so well together and really do compliment each other in ways that no one has before. Their love for each other and the trials that they went through together felt so real.“Have you ever seen anything so perfectly beautiful?”“Yes…”“You.”I fell in love with the found family in this. It\'s the way the people of Wakan all look out for one another and are a big family. Some of my favorites were Doug and Brian as they brought humor with them that had me laughing out loud so much. I adored Liz and felt so bad for everything that she was enduring. Bri was the only friend that Alexis could count on, and that was true to her.This took me through so many emotions that I wasn\'t expecting. The ending was a bit predictable, but I still loved it and was happy with the outcome. The only question I\'m asking myself is, ""What took me so long to read this?"" I\'m excited to read the next book and see Bri get her happy ending.Favorite quotes and moments""Sometimes what you have to give is enough. Even if it’s a rock instead of a diamond.”""Love follows you. It goes where you go. It doesn’t know about social divides or distance or common sense. It doesn’t even stop when the person you love dies. It does what it wants.""""There’s something more final than forever. It’s never.

I want to go back and annotate literally everything. I’m. In. Love.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""“Grace costs you nothing.”Hey, so this was definitely giving a bit of “insta love,” but it’s okay because there was so much more to this book than just the romance.Alexis Montgomery comes from a long line of world-renowned surgeons. She and her twin brother are expected to carry on this legacy, except maybe they don’t want to do it exactly in the way their family members did. As she was headed somewhere, because I really don’t remember where she was going, her car ended up having a problem. Luckily for her, Daniel shows up and helps her. Daniel comes from a local town, where he rents out a family house to visitors. They probably didn’t expect to see each other again, but as fate would have it, they see each other again, and “things” happen. How does their relationship develop from there?I thought this one was really amazing. I wholeheartedly could not put it down and finished it on the same day I started. Let’s start with the romance. Alexis and Daniel were really really really cute. Like I said from the beginning, it was definitely giving insta love but they still developed their relationship over the course of the book. Alexis and Daniel live different lives in regards to money, so it was really nice to see how they learned from each other through tasks and conversations.“Don’t let them decide the life you’re going to live.”A huge part of this book was abuse, both physical and emotional. Jimenez does a great job of highlighting how emotional abuse is just as powerful as physical abuse. I want to especially give a high five for revealing that these kinds of abuse can be among family members. My heart hurt for Alexis so much throughout the book. Except for her twin brother, best friend, and Daniel, I literally hated everyone she was surrounded with. How could someone survive with that much toxic energy? It was very realistic to portray this struggle that she had and how she slowly overcame them one at a time. How does she do this?Of course, Daniel also has his own individual struggles, not abuse, but more on the financial side. I was scared that we weren’t going to see any struggles on Daniel’s side, but we did, even though it felt at times that Alexis' problems were shown more. Daniel is pretty much another illustration of fictional men being amazing. I could smell husband material from the first lines about him. He’s 10 years younger than Alexis, and she made this a pretty big deal. I thought we are in a time when age isn’t a huge deal, but apparently, not everyone thinks this way.Overall, there were some funny lines here and there, and the pacing was great. It wasn’t really smutty though, which I was kinda surprised by. I’m also surprised that I’m surprised since it’s not like the rest of her books were that smutty. I believe Jimenez has written four books so far, all of which I’ve read. Her characters have so much chemistry. It is something she has definitely mastered. I personally think this is her best one yet!!""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""— 4.5 stars ★“Sometimes family isn’t what you’re born into. Sometimes family is found.”I was truly captivated by thisPart of Your Worldfrom very first chapter. Abby Jimenez, what did you put in this book? This is my first book by AJ and I am obsessed with her writing and the characters. I am not a fan of insta-love but Abby has a true talent of writing insta-love stories because it was just so perfectly written. This book is a mixture of hilarious, tender and heart-warming moments. There were moments where I was sobbing but then the next moment I was giggling and smiling because Alexis and Daniel were so precious. This is also the best reverse age-gap book ever written.This book is like the biggest warm hug— like those comfort cardigans you love to wear on your good and bad days. AJ beautifully blended the heavy issues and emotional moments with refreshing and swoon-worthy romance. Abby tackled heavy subjects like emotional and mental abuse, domestic abuse and manipulation in a realistic way and showed us how people deal with their situations differently.“Love follows you. It goes where you go. It doesn’t know about social divides or distance or common sense. It doesn’t even stop when the person you love dies. It does what it wants.”The small town moments and the found family trope was so precious in this book. I loved the way they all were there for each other and how they all were just a big found family. Daniel's friendship with his Doug and Brian and how Alexis was welcomed and loved by his people. Everything was so sweet and tender. There were a lot of nuanced things in this book like the concept of Wakan being a magical town and how it will keep what it wants was kinda cute, it added the modern fairy-tale vibes to Daniel and Alexis's story.➸ Daniel GrantThe man of my dreams. He's just so perfect that no words will ever be enough to describe him and how much I love him. He's so down to earth, appreciates the privileges in his life, has the biggest heart ever, always helping his people, and there is nothing complex about him at all. You read about him and you'll see exactly what he shows you and says to you. He's good, kind, thoughtful, charming, selfless, knows how to love and take care of a woman without even asking for anything in return. I mean he spent two hours down by a river to find a perfect heart shaped rock for his girl, he adopted a war trained dog, he takes care of a baby goat in pyjamas. Aside from this, he also has his own struggles — financially and he tried his best to save his legacy but he also tried not to show his struggles to anyone because he's the one Wakan people depends on. He never pressured Alexis for anything just only ever wanted her time and I did not liked how he was treated by her in this book. Also, did I tell you HE READS AND COOKS!“Even though I didn’t fit into her life, she fit into mine.”➸ Alexis MontgomeryThe woman who belonged to a complete different world than Daniel's and who's rejected the idea of dating until she met the one. She's intelligent, kind-hearted, has lived a very luxurious and extravagant life. My heart broke for her so many times and all the emotional and mental abuse she went through for years by the people who loved her only to criticise her for her own choices. I liked her character development and how she came out of her toxic relationships with her father and her ex and how it made her realise that she was never the problem. Daniel helped her see love and life from a different and clear perspective which helped her understand her true potential and how there's so much to life than just carrying on a 125 years old legacy. Alexis is great and I love her but what I didn't liked about her was how she treated Daniel. There were so many things she could've done differently and that would've made things easy for their already complicated relationship.“It’s amazing how someone can touch you, even if you only know them for a moment in time. How they can change you, alter you indelibly.”╰┈➤ Daniel and AlexisDo I mind that they fell for each other way too soon? Absolutely not because when you know you know. They did started of as friends with benefits but I loved the way they slowly started to get to know each other. They are perfect for each other but their different worlds and lifestyles are not perfect for their reunion. Daniel is the best in their relationship who was ready to give up his town, his legacy, his family just to make a future with her in her city because she means more to him than his 125 years legacy in Wakan. He's truly a gem. Daniel gave Alexis everything she never properly had in her life. She needed love, care and someone who can make her his first priority, someone who won't emotionally abuse her, someone who can accept her as she is and Daniel is that person to her.“How do you do that?” she breathed.“Do what?” I asked, my voice husky.“Know how to touch me.”“I pay attention to you,” I said, kissing her collarbone gently. “How you feel matters to me.”I loved the way he made her feel normal, gave her the normal life she never had, told her all the little and handy things she thought she could never learn, how he always gave her the time and space and his love. He accepted her even without knowing about her extravagant lifestyle and her 125 years legacy. I understand Alexis choice and why she felt she could only protect Daniel by not including him in her luxurious and sophisticated life and she did her best but she also betrayed him so many times by not trying to include him in her life because he only ever wanted her. Daniel deserves so much better and someone who is proud of who he is and I think Alexis could've done better by his side.“Have you ever seen anything so perfectly beautiful?” I breathed. I turned to Daniel. But he wasn’t watching the petals anymore. He was looking at me.“Yes…” he said quietly, holding my eyes. “You.”The endingwas dreamy and no I am not kidding. The third-act breakup was not needed but it was reasonable and it broke my heart because Daniel did not deserved to be treated like someone who's not good enough for the world Montgomery's lives in. He was ready to give up his everything for Alexis and still it would never be enough for her father. Alexis's father is the worst and he should be in jail for the way he emotionally abused his kids and his wife for years. What I liked was how Alexis accepted Daniel in her life and how she didn't give a shit about anyone's reaction and just waited for Daniel to come and walk in her life with his head held high. The epilogue was the cutest ever!I highly and wholeheartedly recommend this book to every hopelessly romantic out there 💌“Kiss me, Daniel Grant.”He looked scandalized. “Right here? In front of everyone?”“Right here. In front of everyone.”""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '⊹ִֶָ 𓂃⋆∞ / 5⋆𓂃ִֶָ ⊹💐“Love follows you. It goes where you go.

BOOK.is so beautiful, funny, and amazing🛐🛐 it had me smiling and giggling THE WHOLE TIME! Also, I was screaming, crying, melting, and kicking my feet. My heart was shattered in some scenes but healed in others. I connected with this book since chapter one, and I loved every single part of it💖 it was my first book by Abby Jimenez, and I’m so happy that I decided to finally read it. Thanks to that, I just foundmy new favorite romance book💗 after reading it, my standards are so high that I just know that it will be extremely difficult for other books to reach them.🌹 𝓢𝓹𝓸𝓲𝓵𝓮𝓻𝓼 𝓐𝓱𝓮𝓪𝓭 🌹❥𝒜𝓁𝑒𝓍𝒾𝓈❤️ ˖⁺. ༶ ⋆˙⊹🦋“I had to drown first.And I was finally,finallyready to save myself.”🦋This woman has my whole heart💗 she lived in privilege her whole life and had the pressure of continuing her family legacy even though it wasn’t what she wanted to do with her life. She wanted an out, but she felt that shecouldn’t disappointher family more than they already were. She needed to feel accepted by her family, friends, coworkers, and everyone in general. Maybe she didn\'t know how to do basic stuff like cooking, cleaning, etc., but we must keep in mind that she was literally conditioned by her parents since she was a child to fulfill the expectations of her family and to have everything handed on a silver platter.But she was raised like that.That was her world- she didn’t know anything better. She was taught that all she had to do was to study, get a job with a high position in the medical field, surround herself with influential people, and marry someone ""worthy"" whom her parents accepted. She didn’t have the mindset to see something else outside this world until she ended her abusive relationship, went to therapy, started to set boundaries for her parents and order her priorities, and when she met Daniel. Then, she started her journey of self-discovery,self-awareness, and personal growth. I was so proud of her and her character development.❤️\u200d🩹“Daniel empowered me, instead of stripping me. Lifted me up instead of keeping me low.”❤️\u200d🩹❥𝒟𝒶𝓃𝒾𝑒𝓁💚 ˖⁺. ༶ ⋆˙⊹💗“She felt like the sun. Like she was the reason for everything. Like I’d always been waiting for her to get closer and bring me to life.”💗Where should I start? THISS MAN!🛐 he’s so thoughtful, generous, sweet, caring, respectful, gentle, adorable. He has: the most charming and selfless personality, tattoos, dimples, and the cutest dog and a baby goat (it’s his friend’s, but he helps him a lot taking care of it).🤍“Nothing could convince me this woman wasn\'t made for me to love. I think my soul recognized hers the second I laid eyes on her. Our bodies knew it the very first night.The power she had over me terrified me. But it also gave me clarity.There is a peace in knowing the one thing you can\'t live without. It simplifies all things. There was her, and then there was everything and everyone else. And only she really mattered.”🤍Since I first read about this man, he captivated me. There’s justsomethingabout him that always had me smiling, melting, and kicking my feet. Was it his charisma or how he took care of Alexis? Was it how humble he was or how openly he was to love Alexis despite their differences and the odds of not being able to fit in each other’s life? He is the sweetest person ever. He made Alexis feel safe, beautiful, powerful, heard, seen, helpful, worthy, and happy. Daniel helped her heal from her past relationship which was mentally abusive. He helped her raise her self-esteem, and always encouraged and supported her. Since the beginning, all he wanted was to worship her and make her feel comfortable. Daniel made her his priority and was willing to give up everything just to be with her. Andd he didn’t doubt that not even once.🛐😭“I\'d give up my life here to be where she was if she\'d have me. I\'d give up my house and this town and all the people in it. If she was at the hospital eighty hours a week, I could be there when she left and be there when she came home. Make her breakfast, take her lunch, take her dinner. I could pick up the slack. She wouldn\'t have to do anything, it could be all me this time -I\'d go to her. It didn\'t have to end.”😭🛐❥𝐵𝓇𝒾🤍 ˖⁺. ༶ ⋆˙⊹☀️“You don’t have to feel like this. You literally don’t. Quit. Leave. Pick him. Pick yourself.”☀️This gorgeous woman💕Alexis\' best friend and the only one she truly deserved. Not like Gabby or Jessica, the superficial and hypocritical “friends”. Bri is the type of friend who is so genuine and the one who will tell you all the hard truths, even if you don’t like it. She was always there for Alexis when she needed her the most, and she helped keep her grounded. She was so helpful for Alexis to recognize her true feelings and take those brave steps to organize her priorities and follow her dreams, not her parents. Also, she helped Daniel to calm down, avoid misunderstandings and reunite them. I love her <3❥ 𝓣𝓱𝓮 𝓼𝓶𝓪𝓵𝓵 𝓽𝓸𝔀𝓷🌻 ˖⁺. ༶ ⋆˙⊹💝“Sometimes family isn’t what you’re born into. Sometimes family is found.And I’d found mine in Wakan.I’d found mind inhim.”💝I’ve said it before, small towns romance books have a soft spot in my heart❤️\u200d🩹 there’s something so special, sweet, and cozy about them. Wakan didn’t disappoint at all. The people there weren’t just simple neighbors. They were a family. A strong bond and found family that won my heart. All of them were so special. They had me laughing so hard and melting, and they were the sweetest and the most supportive people ever.❥My thoughts💭 ˖⁺. ༶ ⋆˙⊹➴every single chapterwas magical🦋✨ this book hooked me from the very beginningwhich normally is very hard for me to achieve.Part of Your Worldis my new favorite romance book💜 I felt a rollercoaster of emotions and enjoyed every single word of this book.➴ I hated so much Alexis\' parents. I could say so many things about them, but I would never end. Her father was a narcissist who only cared about prestige and was mentally abusive to her. Her mother never stood up for Alexis or her twin. They mistreated her and didn’t care for her well-being or happiness. She deserved so much better, but I’m so glad she found her own family in Wakan, Daniel, Bri, and her twin.➴ the third act breakup broke MY HEART. I felt like I was the one who was drowning instead of them. THAT is how empathetic I was toward this book.➴ when Daniel thought Alexis was embarrassed of him? SO HEARTBREAKING💔 he just wanted to be supportive, love her, and just be there for her. He was willing to give up EVERYTHING- his house, work, town, and follow her to another city just to be with her. Thissss man😭💗➴ this was an insta love, and you know what? I didn’t mind that one bit because I truly felt all the chemistry since the beginning. They were so opposites, and they lived in very different worlds. Even though, Alexis and Daniel had a beautiful, comfortable, and palpable connection since the moment they met and as they got to know each other and formed a relationship. They had insecurities, fears, wounds, and all the odds were against them. But they found a way to mix their worlds and be together despite the obstacles. They helped each other bring out the best of them and be the best versions of themselves. They became each other\'s priority and were willing to give up everything to be together. They just wanted to live their lives doing what they wanted and loving each other. And they achieved it. No matter how many differences they had, that didn\'t stop them from following their hearts and fighting against the odds to be together. I\'m the happiest with their happy ending💖❥Other quotes just because I love them✨I didn\'t like that others had to take care of me. I wanted to know how to take care of myself. I wanted to pull my weight and learn to be self-reliant so that when I did depend on someone, it was by choice and not necessity. And it was Daniel who was teaching me how.“I see you. I would save you if you were drowning.”“I pay attention to you. How you feel matters to me.”“Grace costs you nothing.”He was in a black tux. One hand on the railing, and every woman in the room looking at him- but he was looking atme.“Have you ever seen anything so perfectly beautiful?” I breathed.I turned to Daniel. But he wasn’t watching the petals anymore. He was looking at me. “Yes…” he said quietly, holding my eyes. “You.”He pulled out something and put it in my palm. It was a rock…“It’s shaped like a heart,” he said. “Took me two hours to find it.”It wasn\'t flashy. It cost him nothing but his time- but that was the gift. Daniel didn\'t have time. That was his most valuable commodity right now, and he\'d given it to find me this?She said she didn\'t see a future with us. That our lives didn\'t fit. I knew there were things I could never give her. At best, I had about as much to offer as my damn dog, companionship, and entertainment…But I could love her better than anyone ever could for the rest of her life.That, I knew. And if there was even a fraction of a chance that might be enough, I was going to take it.Anyways, I will forever recommend this book to absolutely everyone. I hope you all enjoy it💜🦋🥀“There’s something more final than forever. It’s never. Never is infinite.”🥀'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'It’s no secret that Abby Jimenez writes some of my favorite Romance books….Although I only read a few a year, you can BET that one of them will always be whatever Abby has published! I am always so excited when I see that she has a new book available to request.Sure, this genre has a formula that leads to happily ever after-but that doesn’t mean it’s easy to write.In romance you MUST like the characters, you MUST enjoy their dialogue, and you MUST feel the chemistry!! 🔥In addition, you absolutely MUST feel the angst! Theirs and yours-as you become worried that one of the leads will let the other get away, causing you to scream at that character to “go get your person”!NOW!!All the boxes are checked here!And, once again, Abby Jimenez adds an “extra layer” to her stories by weaving another important topic into a sub-plot-this time, “domestic violence-both verbal and physical abuse“, providing resources after the epilogue.This story introduces us Alexis Montgomery, who has been tapped to carry on her family legacy of world-renowned surgeons. (Think Meredith Grey of Grey’s Anatomy) She and her brother, Derek, have been groomed since childhood to be the next generation to lead their prestigious hospital into the next century and then Derek bails out.Not their first choice, but nonetheless, now their only choice, their parents want Alexis to marry the right man-Neil-the head of surgery-have the right friends-the horrible Jessica and Gabby, and fulfill her destiny-Despite the fact that she has she realized that she doesn’t want any of these things.Late one night, she is driving home from an out of town funeral, and she has to swerve to avoid hitting a raccoon-ending up in a ditch. Daniel Grant, a very tattooed, blue color, (and younger) man, offers to tow her out, and afterward she runs into him again at a nearby bar -which is the only place in town that is open this late with available food and rest rooms.She decides to help him win a bet against his friends as a way to “thank him” for his assistance.Despite the fact that their lives are as different as night and day, their sizzling chemistry is undeniable, and will make Alexis question if money does buy happiness and if if she has the courage to live life on her own terms.As she tries to reconcile how she feels, we hear from both Alexis and Daniel, in alternating chapters, and I enjoyed hearing from them both equally.Thankfully, Alexis has one true friend in her corner, Bri, and we should ALL have a friend like her-a friend who will tell you what you NEED to hear, and CHEER YOU ON, as you go for what will make you happy!If you have enjoyed this author’s past work-you will enjoy this book too!AVAILABLE NOW!!One last thing—I was excited to learn that in 2023, it will be Bri’s turn in the spotlight and it will be her chance to find happiness! ❤️ My calendar is already marked!!Thank You to Forever for my gifted copy!

She did whatever she wanted, whenever she wanted. She never did care for how Daniel might have felt. I understand her complication. Alexis was emotionally abused by every man in her life, no one cared for her feelings. But that didn't give her the rights to hurt Daniel who was literally an Angel. And man! Did she hurt him! She hurt his poor heart again and again and still Daniel was willing to fight for their love. I hated how awful she was to him. Absolute worst. I am so angry at her.Alexis doesn't deserve Daniel Grant, she never did.Then again, I would have overlooked all Alexis's faults and flaws if only the couple had good communication between them. They had zero to no communication. Alexis went through a lot. She should have shared her problems and feeling with Daniel. Instead she decided to hide things from him.Where was the chemistry?

No chemistry or bonding whatsoever..Meh...""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I FOUND MY FIRST 5 STAR BOOK OF 2024! This was such an emotional roller coaster. CW: emotional/mental abuse by partner and parents, parental abandonment, domestic violencePart of Your Worldis not the book I was expecting. To be honest, I didn't think I was going to like it solely because of Alexis; however, as I worked through the novel more, I realized how much I connected to not only the story, but also the characters. While this is a journey of their romance, I definitely think it does a great job of handling the complications related to toxic partners as well as toxic parents.What Worked:EVERYTHING! It's rare for me to think that all elements of book work together to create the perfect story, but Abby Jimenez did a great job not only developing the romance between Alexis and Daniel, but also these conversations related to the importance of found family. I will admit that Alexis isn't easy to deal with in the beginning. She's hesitant about starting a new relationship because of her separation from her current partner, but there were moments where she's not that great towards Daniel. It took a while for me to understand her as a character, but I appreciated the manner in Jimenez takes her time developing her and allowing her story to come full circle. Her behavior is a direct result of the emotional abuse she experiences at the hands of her parents. It forces her to make decisions with them in mind at all times even though she's an adult. It's a toxic cycle that she's been forced to accept and normalize, and it greatly impacts how she views the relationship between herself and Daniel. On the other hand, Daniel is the perfect character, a cinnamon roll that has a heart of gold. Raised by his grandparents and his small-town community, Daniel understands the importance of found family and assists Alexis in understanding how to make decisions for her own happiness and not that of others. There are brief discussions related to domestic violence and its impact on a side character. While I've seen some reviews that feel as though this element was simply thrown into the story, I think it also helps Alexis come to terms with the abuse that she faces at the hands of her own ex and parents. I thought the medical back drop of this was great and really helped support the idea that money and prestige doesn't always equate to complete happiness. This was well written and paced. I ADORED the side characters from Daniel's hometown as well as Alexis' best friend. They help these two continue to find each other and the love their share time after time.Overall, this was a wonderful, amazing, and emotional read. I haven't cried this much reading a book in a while. I don't know if any of Jimenez's other works will have the same impact, but I'm excited to explore more of her backlist.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I started this at about 8:18pm.

I’ve read every book she’s written and I’ve loved them all.Part of Your Worldis one of her best. I loved so much about this story and these characters. I mean,Daniel! Could she have written a more perfect hero? I think not.Alexis is not having a good day when she swerves to miss an animal and ends up in a ditch. Two hours away from home. She’s waiting for a tow when a young guy in a truck pulls up to assist her. His name is Daniel and he’s about ten years younger than her. He’s kind, refreshing, and all kinds of wonderful. Once they spend a night together, they can’t stay away from each other.Talk about totally different worlds though. The life Alexis leads as a thirty seven year old successful ER physician compared to Daniel’s small town life of running his family’s business and doing some carpenter/mayor work on the side couldn’t be less alike but that doesn’t seem to matter. These two are compatible in all the ways that count and Alexis has never been treated so well in her entire life.Of course I loved the romance of this story. It was so lovely and the banter was great. I laughed more than once. There is also some emotion, a bit of angst, and it touches on some sensitive subject matterAbuse- physical and mental/emotional. We’ve already established that Daniel was perfect and Alexis was great as well- her growth was a joy to watch. I loved so many of the side characters and I especially loved the small town Daniel was from. It felt truly magical. Almost like it was it’s own character. It had a great ‘found family’ aspect as well.Because sometimes family isn’t what you’re born into. Sometimes family is found.Part of Your Worldgave me that same THIS IS GOING TO BE A FAVORITE feel as ‘The Friend-Zone” did and I’m sure it’s going to be on my favorites list in 2022. This one is a must read romance I highly recommend!'}]"

Those born Ordinary are just that—ordinary. And when the king decreed that all Ordinaries be banished in order to preserve his Elite society, lacking an ability suddenly became a crime—making Paedyn Gray a felon by fate and a thief by necessity.Surviving in the slums as an Ordinary is no simple task, and Paedyn knows this better than most. Having been trained by her father to be overly observant since she was a child, Paedyn poses as a Psychic in the crowded city, blending in with the Elites as best she can in order to stay alive and out of trouble. Easier said than done.When Paeydn unsuspectingly saves one of Ilyas princes, she finds herself thrown into the Purging Trials. The brutal competition exists to showcase the Elites’ powers—the very thing Paedyn lacks. If the Trials and the opponents within them don’t kill her, the prince she’s fighting feelings for certainly will if he discovers what she is—completely Ordinary.","[{'rating': 1, 'content': ""an editor! an editor! my kingdom for a f*cking editor!(no kingdoms were harmed in the making of this review)˚✩ ⋆｡˚ ✩i am what some sexist pigs would call a basic bitch. if you give me a tall, dark-haired, sarcastic, morally-grey guy in a romantasy that combines some of my favourite books and tropes -whilst still keeping some sense of originality, i'll be content.this book had all of that. (well, the tall-dark-haired-mmc-in-a-romantasy part)excluding the originality. (and the morally-grey part but i’ll get to that)lauren said powerless was“if the child of the hunger games and red queen didn't look anything like its parents.”…see, if that were true, then this review wouldn’t exist.(and i know i’m the myopic bitch of the prime meridian, but this was exactly like it’s parents, as well shatter me and the selection)in fact, i was so angry about it, that i made a whole list. and then other people helped me add more to the list, and then, i realised that this wasn’t really an unpopular opinion at all.but before i get into all the ways this book was unoriginal, i’m going to criticise everything else. and if you don’t want to read about that,then scroll away.do not throw a tantrum in the comment section because someone expressed their criticisms about a book that you enjoyed. it’s incredibly immature, and quite franklyhilariousstupid because you’re wasting your time writing a comment that i’m just going to deleteafter screenshotting it and sending it on the group chat.anyway, let’s talk about something that actually wasn’t criticised that much: the writing.for a debut novel, it wasn’t that bad. for a book hyped up to the point where it could be mistaken as the greatest literary masterpiece this generation could ever bear witness to, it was trash.it read like an unedited draft that was both half-finished and yet too long at the same time, with the typos only making it worse. every sentence was so long-winded with synonyms upon synonyms being thrown into one sentence so whilst it might sound like this deeply thought-out didactic monologue about how inflation has affected the economy to the point that shakespeare's sonnets are no longer analysed correctly, it’s really just a horny teenage boy trying to sound edgy.and serious question: have recent authors heard of show not tell? i am not an idiot incapable of coming to my own conclusions, thank you very much. i don’t need to be told about just how morally questionable princekrabskai is, when i should just be able toinferfrom what the authorimplies. except the author didn't imply anything, for fuck's sake this dude barely killed anyone.on top of that, the sheer amount of times i read “blue eyes”, “smoky eyes”, “ocean eyes” was enough to put me off reading forever. billie eilish is crying through her “aquamarine orbs” right now. and the amount of times these characters were huffing and puffing - for the love of all that is holy, use!!an!!inhaler!! someone’s lips were always twitching into a smile, or someone was snorting/ chuckling/ blinking/ eyeing something or someone, or paedyn was being called “vicious little thing” by kai - which only succeeded in me receiving fourth wing flashbacks. kai was always flicking paedyn’s nose for no given reason, and one or the other was constantly in a “throng of people”. plus, the inner monologues were also the most repetitive things i have ever read which really helped make the book incredibly long and boring, with the pacing losing to a snail in a 500m run. it’s filled with so much banter and such eye-rolling dialogue that after a certain point, you begin to wonder how on earth the mcs would cope without hearing themselves speak, as well as so many trope-centred and pointless scenes.if you don’t believe me yet, screw you and read this list of tropes:knife/dagger/arrow to the throat (every other page), enemies to lovers (not on a single page), insta lust, slow burn, who did this to you, she's so smol, forbidden romance, cleaning each other’s wounds, comforting after a nightmare, the most unnecessary love triangle (only one love interest has a pov), some stupid trials that have no history and don’t even make sense, and the street thief trope (cue the eyeroll - i’m probably an outlier on this one, but i just hate how much the street thief trope has been overused. there was no way paedyn would have survived a day on the streets with the amount of stupid shit that she pulled. did no one notice her wonderfully-amazing-most-gorgeous-beautiful-stunning-oh-so-rare-never-seen-before hair colour while she was off pickpocketing the rich? i’m very sure no one did, seeing as it wasn’t mentioned on every.other.page.)now it's time for more stupid things.. so many stupid things. so many. and i’ve actually missed a lot so if you can remember anything i’m missing please let me know <3➳ a trained soldier is dancing in the middle of a deathly arena because he likes a girl -

which i’m pretty sure was ripping off the selection, which starred our just as talented, just as flawless america singer!, who by the way is a singer. from the dollar tree.ANYWAY, according to this very unbiased book, miss paypal over here had exactly 0 flaws. her only weakness was her infinite love for others, which was clearly evidenced when her seamstress friend is introduced yet barely ever mentioned. when our “darling” pae finally realises that she forgot about her after she was whisked away to the palace to become a princess overnight, she has the audacity to ignore her the entire time because she's too busy fawning over prince kahoot. *sigh* don’t you just love our 2012 wattpad heroine!now for prince krabs! yay! honestly he was the funniest character in the bookby far. his lines weren’t just cheesy and cringey, they were downright stupid too! he really is the whole package *swoons*he was bland as fuck omg. and annoying. very annoying. the only thing he ever managed to kill was my sanity. he’s also managed to ruin the word “darling” for me forever, which is yk, great. morally-grey my ass, he's a walmart kaz (insulting to kaz but still). he has no true redeeming qualities, and for that reason i quite frankly believe that him and pea-brain really deserve each other!(iwasgoing to do a section on the side-characters, but considering the amount of brain cells i have already lost just by recounting the so-called “personalities” of the two love-birds above, i don’t think that will be the best thing to do right now. however, when i figure out how to regenerate my axons and dendrites, i will be back.)˚✩ ⋆｡˚ ✩after this rather long paragraph ends, there will be tons of spoilers for the selection series (which i don’t recommend reading), the red queen (didn’t love it, didn’t hate it, just indifferent), the hunger games (if you haven’t read this yet, then what the hell are you doing with your life?), and a few mentions of the shatter me series (which is regarded by some as the greatest piece of literature and by others - me - as the greatest piece of dog sh*t that was dropped into this world), the darkest mind series (i’ve never read it), and the jasad heir (i enjoyed it). if you don’t want to be spoiled (although not all the similarities are spoilers, i just couldn't be asked to mark the ones that are) then you can skip to the bottom of this review where you will see a funny gif i found that pretty much sums up my personal experience with powerless.update:there is now a bonus section at the end (before the funny gif) with books that are similar/give the same vibes as powerless. note: i have not read all of these so please don't kill me if i'm wrong about any. if you have any info you want me to add then leave me a comment/dmyes, i realise that i have missed out on so many herethe selection:➳illéailya➳ a girl from the slums and from an undesirable position in society that rose up in the ranks➳ our fmc has different colour dress to everyone else➳ all the scenes where they're eating food➳ the queen likes the dancing in the balls➳ the balls➳ the safe room stuff that i’m not asked to go into detail about➳ the girl on girl hate -

i was rooting for her so hard. it was refreshing to see a fmc that didn’t have magic or special powers and had to rely on her wits to stay alive. she was an incredibly written character — the overlooked girl who constantly had to fight for what she has. her strength, wit, determination and preservation was just so admirable. getting to see her development and overcome so many obstacles was so lovely to read about. she is one of the best fmcs i have read about in a while!! she is the embodiment of “don’t underestimate the underdog.” watching her prove everyone wrong was so fun to read about, she always found a way to conquer a situation and be powerful in her own way. but girly was way stronger than me. constantly pulling away from someone you want is baffling to me, especially since it’s kai like girl that man is obsessed with you!!➳kai:the prince of Ilya and the king’s future enforcer hunts those like paedyn and kills them, yet pae somehow convinces him she’s a mundane, an elite who has a lesser power. kai has the ability to sense and use other elites powers and though he can’t sense pae’s “psychic” ability he goes along with it. from there we get to witness their palpable chemistry and snarky banter. aaa he is everything n more, i can’t get over him. this man just has a way with words. the way i was giggling like a little girl, blushing, twirling my hair and kicking my feet every time he spoke. kai was a complex character, and his struggle for redemption was interesting to read about despite who he had become. but he was just so sweet, charming, tortured, swoony, witty and perfect. when he braided her hair and called her “my pretty pae” I COMPLETELY LOST IT. I NEED HIM BIBLICALLY. the way he was so down bad for pae?? he was smitten with her from the very beginning — for him, she is the only girl in the room. the fact that he knew her capabilities and gave ‘that’s my girl’ vibes rather than forcing her into protection and hiding her away from the world. seriously, how can you not love him!!— what was the authors fascination with the characters fkn eye colour. like seriously take a shot every time you read “ocean eyes” and “grey eyes” (spoiler you will probably die from alcohol poisoning) like pls stfu about his grey eyes and her ocean eyes, i got it the first 10 times you said it and also pae constantly going on about kitt’s green eyes omg pls free me, enough is enough!! 😭➷ the slow burn is absolutely top tier, it worked so perfectly for the setting and the plot. how the author built up this fiery and heated chemistry between the mcs despite them not even sharing a single kiss was just so immaculate 😮\u200d💨 the banter and the tension was incredible, i just love the combination of a “who did this to you” boy meets “i will stab you” / “why do you care” girl. the banter and tension was good but their sweet and vulnerable moments together were even better. seriously the romance is just incredible, the way both characters navigate their own storyline but are so heavily intertwined at the same time, it was all consuming in the best possible way. the tension, knife to throat scenes, the longing stares, the lingering touches, the dance scenes, the yearning, the banter & flirty conversations is etched into my memory!!”mark my words, prince, i will be your undoing.” i lean in, ignoring the knife against my throat as i murmur, “oh, darling, i look forward to it.”— this book is marketed as “enemies to lovers” but it’s definitely more of an instant attraction as they were both captivated with one another from the very beginning. kitt (kai’s brother) and pae would be a true enemies to lovers since she didn’t like him bc of who he constantly reminded her of.— the world-building wasn’t the best and very much lacking as there wasn’t much description and depth and there was many repetitive phrases throughout this book but as this was a debut novel i’m not going to make any judgements on that as i didn’t mind and i didn’t expect this book to be perfect.this book was very fast paced which i appreciated since a lot of fantasy books tend to be slow at times. the world is easy to understand so this book is great for those who are new to fantasy books. the beginning was rocky for me but once i was into it i was really into it - you do get easily engaged and immersed, mainly because the romance is worth it. i felt so much devastation as i was reading the last few chapters. there was so much action, so much emotion and so many reveals. the author done an amazing job setting up book two because there is still so much left unsaid — I SERIOUSLY NEED THAT BOOK RN!!'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4 stars\'Who did this to you\'BOY\'why do you care\'GIRL.This book is literally a romcom with action scenes in it!

What else do you want??? He\'s so hot for fuck\'s sake! 😭Dark hairs, Gray eyes with loose black shirts, cocky smirk AND DIMPLES.😮\u200d💨The reason this was more rom-com type to me because he was so flirty! He was so gentle and sweet with her. He so selflessly helped her so many times without caring about himself and constantly teased and had fun with her.like letting her pin him with a dagger to the throat, silently asking permission to touch her, braiding her hair, dancing with her, doing anything to protect her life, counting her freckles, stayed awake whole night just to watch her and being affected with just her putting her finger on him! jakshsjssb 😭😭 and......

How she fought and no doubt she was pretty strong and amazing on the fighting aspect and how she was trained so perfectly. Her backstory and all didn\'t quite hit me much just like Kai\'s.❝Promise me you’ll stay alive long enough to stab me in the back?❞yes she will LITERALLY and FIGURATIVELY! 👺She has both the prince (Kai and his brother - kitt) wrapped around her finger.THEY BOTH ARE SO SMITTEN 😭, and she was also trying to make Kai her enemy in the start, and ngl prettyyy forced, but glad they lost sight of that lol! I\'m so glad she wasn\'t horny and was pretty annoyed with Kai and wanted nothing with him! Her being attracted to him didn\'t happen quickly, rather it developed slowly but nicely.I won\'t say that her wearing a different color to a ball (where everyone wore green) was pick meHermione Grangervibes lol, but it was definitely cool of her though! Also, SHE\'S THE MAIN CHARACTER SO LET HER SHINE!Her saying \'Gonna stab you in the heart\' was literally the 288262th time. She\'sVicious little thingas he called her.

And all because I saved that prick of a prince.❞•Pae is a thief, and she robbed Kai when he visited the town, and Kai was drawn to her because of the fact that he couldn\'t sense any power from her.Then she saved Kai from a Silencer (one who diminishes power), She caught the eye of everyone as the silver savior, and got selected for Purging Trials — where different trials are taken place for an elite to win. And this year, Kai is a part of them! Now she has to figure out how to SURVIVE because she\'s without power.The whole trials plot was good, but everything was a bit descriptive, and the story was falling into repetition (flirting, banter, and fluff only), and the trials were interesting, but the pace of each of them was different. One taking a lot of chapters, and the other ending in just 3.Many errors in it so the author should def change her editorotherwise everything was fine.

OH MY GOSH~•~•~That ending hurt. A lot.*deep breath* Okay let\'s get started with the review.I absolutely adored this book.The world created is so mesmerizing. The characters and storyline are so compelling. Both the leads- Paedyn and Kai are lovable. I\'ll be honest, this book is not perfect but I enjoyed it regardless.✔️ Magic system✔️ Forbidden romance✔️ Angsty slow burn✔️ Mutual pining✔️ Knife to the throat✔️ Tending to scars✔️ ""Who did this to you?""✔️ He kills for herThe book imostarts off a tad slowbut it\'s completely understandable as we are getting to know the world, the fantasy elements and the characters. It picks up pace towards the middle and stays consistent.An issue I had with this book and which is why it wasn\'t a perfect read for me is the fact that it reminded me TOO MUCH of The Hunger Games.I appreciate when authors take inspiration from a book and make something new with it but the first half of this book was a bit too much replication. This is not to damper anyone\'s expectations but rather give a realistic approach. I still enjoyed it quite a lot which you can see from my updates but it would have been perfect had this issue not existed.I absolutely LOVED the charactersand the complexities that came with them. Kai and Paedyn were imperfectly perfect. They have so much depth and life to them, it was hard to resist them.Kaiis going straight to my book boyfriends list. The man is capable of making me swoon and feel things by merely saying a few words and they don\'t even have to be romantic. He radiates such energy, charisma, and obviously his powers intrigues me a lot. The way he is so smitten with Pae is everything. For him, she is the only girl in the room. For him, she is his and he\'ll do anything to keep her alive and safe.Paedynis no less. She is fierce, equally charismatic and full of zeal and the woman knows how much power she holds in her flirtations, touches over Kai. Her confidence and the ability to stay strong is so impressive. I loved how she holds her own. She tried so hard to resist the charms of the prince and yet found herself wanting him more and I absolutely loved it.The romance is deliciously angsty and slow burning.I get some people are on the surface cause it\'s YA and don\'t really want to give it a go cause of that but believe me you\'re gonna be missing out on the beauty of these two and their intense chemistry. I didn\'t find myself yearning for spice, everything about these two hit perfectly and I wouldn\'t change a thing about it at all.The side characters,Kittin particular, are deeply complex. I saw him destined to become the king that he did at the end, from the beginning. It didn\'t come as a surprise. I found myself sympathizing with him and Kai more so for Pae. I don\'t mind Kitt becoming someone he wasn\'t meant to be, it\'s going to make things immensely interesting. Jax and A were my other favourites.The ending was predictable imo.I saw it coming ages ago so although I wasn\'t completely shocked, it was still impactful and made me excited to read the next one.Overall, an enjoyable read and one I absolutely love. It has the potential of becoming my favorite series but will see how the next books go 😉 What y\'all waiting for? Give it a read!!Like Powerless? Read these-1. The Hunger Games2.

In the end, it appeared that she desperately attempted to sew and combine multiple clichéd scenes to force the protagonists to be in a sort of forced proximity. & it simply did not blend well because the final patchwork felt everything but spontaneous.while the intrigue was compelling enough to dive into the book at first, the unclear and blurry world building made it quite boring after a few chapters. I was under the impression that the author would simplify and distill explanations throughout the story. (how many powers there’s in the wild, for exemple.) but the main question that puzzled the entirety of the book was\'why the trials?\'. i believed it was ancestral, but it wasn\'t. we were not given a concret clarification of why they had to go through them. (solely for the sake of money? sure.)the writing was mediocre to say the least, with an abondance of”blue eyes""not very well dispatched in the narrative. repetitive expressions that clearly underline that the author needs to urgently change editors. the predictability in the dialogues was a major issue for me. It appeared thatKai and Pae were constantly attempting to make the most stereotypical comments. even the king\'s speeches were not as majestic as they should have been.the lack of depth in the characters was the primary reason for my difficulty in going through these 500 pages. why didn\'t the author incorporate any other colors into Pae\'s character other than her still mourning her deceased father? or to Kai to aspire to be more than the future enforcer ? all he does is complain and mop about his obligation to kill people and his brother\'s inability to handle it if the roles where inversed. instead of it being a well depicted enemies to lovers with good character’s wisdom and portrayal it just wavered into them already thinking about each other in a romantic way. all that because the narrative forced them to spend a lot of time with each other.how do you persuade readers to want to continue a trilogy when they aren\'t that attached to the protagonists in the first place?⚠️⚠️⚠️spoilersi did not sign for a love triangle.the way pae inlassably brought up her father’s death and how Kai made strange comments about his first murder seemed like he killed her father not the king.——-here we go..'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'you should know i’m honest to my core when i tell you that i love the author - i think she is an angel of a human being - but i really did not love her book. tragic considering i went in expecting to enjoy it. one day i will stop getting bamboozled by this exact variety of tiktok hype but that day is apparently not today!!!similar to the hunger games i guess if you are ok with nothing making in-universe sense and the reasoning behind it all being “🤷\u200d♀️ i dunno, vibes?” instead of a thoughtful critique of capitalism, commodification, and spectacle.i think i could have gotten past that though (not everything has to be that serious lmfao i am an ali hazelwood fan…i would be throwing stones from a GLASS HOUSE) but the writing was just so over the top and longwinded-but-also-average-fanfiction-vibes in a way that is difficult to capture in a review but that you’d get right away reading the book. it is this very specific style where the author says something, and then says it again but with other words that start with the same letters, and then the sentence has ~parallelism~ but also it is so obviously baked in that it loses any impact. like: ""she was Bold and Beautiful and Beyond my Bountiful expectations."" but x1000 all throughout the book. i found it pretty hard to get through by the end.with that said - i am but one (1) girl, this is a minority opinion. most people i trust online like this book. i think if the writing style doesn’t bother you this could be mindlessly fun a la fourth wing. it doesn\'t take itself particularly seriously. the central relationship is very slow burn and has ample yearning/a decent foundation - though it is quite instalove in terms of their individual feelings, NOT legitimate enemies to lovers (they like each other lmao) and the banter (much like the writing) is often over the top. the story has a mountain of cliches - but they are cliches for a reason. sometimes you just want something silly that is full of all of your guilty pleasure tropes. this was not my experience. but it could be yours, and i hope lauren keeps writing!!!'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3 starsit’s time to be honest.let me start by saying that i didn’t (and still don’t) know who lauren is on booktok. sothis review is unbiased as possible. 🫶🏻(please don’t forget that a 3 stars isn’t a bad rating either.)the first half of this book was nearly a copy and paste of the hunger games.while some readers probablywantthat, it took away from originality for me. i could NOT stop comparing for storyline.

For this being Lauren’s first book, I was impressed. It has a solid storyline and great characters. Overall, I didn’t hate it and can’t wait to see how the story will continue.I will say I wish the world building was more in depth and expanded, along with the characters.

I don’t read much fantasy because im a romance girly but this satisfied me so much. not to mention i was helplessly in love with kai the whole entire time, so that introduced a little bias heheh.🌏 the world building:it wasn’t confusing at all, for once I actually understood what was going on instead of them having the most twisted storyline with the craziest names that you can’t even pronounce. I definitely think this is a good book to get into fantasy, and if you actually wanna see romance and not just crumbs🫂 romanceeee 🫂yall I guarantee youthis will be the best banteryou ever, ever read. it’s too good. they bounce off eachother so well, they flirt SHAMELESSLY and we love to see it hehe.“Promise me you’ll stay alive long enough to stab me in the back?” I laugh loudly. “That’s been my goal all along, prince.”lets ignore the fact thatshe does stab him in the back.. and think about how cute these two are 🤭🤭 seriously one of my new fav couples, the most chemistry ive seen in agess. if this book wasn’t so damn stressful, I’d reread this book until I have it memorised, but I think I’ll just go back and read my fav scenes.🩶 kai azer 🩶i think i read like 10 chapters, and then immediately ran to put him in mybook husbands shelf.I was that confident he was gonna eat, and tbh, without him this is just a mediocre book.“Mark my words, prince, I will be your undoing.” I lean in, ignoring the knife against my throat as murmur, “Oh, darling, I look forward to it.”like come on,how do you not fall in love right after that?if it were me, i’d fold the minute he called me darling. but hey, pae is strong, and we love that.she literally beat all the elites without any powers?that’s just embarrassing for them. i would crumble after task 1. not even after, like five minutes in.🗡️ paedyn gray 🗡️she’s my fav kind of fmc.so strong, but also super funny? and has a backbone whichwe love.only thing I didn’t love ishow badly she treated kitt. believe it or not, I actually liked him. he was kind, he was sweet, he just wanted his father to love him which like who doesn’t you can’t blame him for that. I hope he gets a good ending, maybe not with paeBECAUSE KAIPAE FORVER!!but like in general I don’t want him to die or anything.

Thank you🥰)❗️•It was a Red queen fan fiction.•Zero original ideas.•The last 40 pages were the only interesting and unique plot from the author.•Long boring (bad structured) paragraphs•Wattpad diologue.•Lazy writing.•The Characters reactions made no sense.•Enemies to lovers? More like: forced and lazy interactions to enemies (ig)•Quotes that felt repetitive or were directly written many times in the same page or chapter.⚔️ “Inspired by Red queen and The hunger games” = excuse to not say she copied everything about those two series and changed some aspects or characters in the most lazy way. Example:The cream that cures Katniss and it’s sent from Haymitch is changed into: Kai finding a remedy to cure Paedyn because it might’ve fallen from another person’s pocket. LIKE WHAT?⚔️Everything about the trials was boring and didn’t make any sense. When it first started I was like: Finally! 200 pages of nothing, maybe it gets better and then boom IT NEVER DID.⚔️Paedyn and Kitt had more chemistry than Paedyn and Kai (it felt so forced). They were ALWAYS finding each other (also another way to never develop the other characters that had a lot of potential since they all had different and interesting powers). The “I hate you” but I have no idea why was SO HARD IN THIS BOOK.⚔️When I got to Kai’s POV, he was always saying that she wanted to be enemies but in reality they were always flirting and touching each other because they have to have “quemistry” but apparently you also have to force an enemies to lovers trope because what is revealed at the end has to make sense but it never does. It’s very clear that there is NO reason for you to hate Kai because of his “beauty” and the fact that he remains you of his father. Which also leads me to talk about the king and queen:⚔️THE QUEEN was never there, she loved Kai but never did anything for him. Why? We are given a poor excuse that that was correct for him and he was always destined to become the enforcer and suffer.⚔️THE KING and his personality that didn’t make sense, bother me SO MUCH and let’s not talk about his poor dialogues. He was the reason of all the tragedies and traumas but he was even sharing dinner in the same table with everyone!!!😁You can do that, yes! My problem is that he doesn’t have a well developed personality leading his character to become ridiculous in the eyes of the reader.⚔️And I say instead of forcing Kai and Paedyn to find each other ALL THE TIME use all those pages to make her interact with the other characters like Lenny: cuz wdym he calls you princess and likes you out of nowhere (remember if you’re writing a book you are telling the story to the readers not to you! So even if it looks “obvious” you have to develop that relationship and write it directly)⚔️Also, let’s not talk about the amount of ridiculous nicknames🙄🙄🙄⚔️Adena was there at the beginning and at the end, leaving me like: ok you love her so much but she’s barely mentioned throughout the book.⚔️The father taught her how to fight and he was a healer 💀The characters had NO personality, only plain mid and typical backstories.⚔️If you haven’t read Red Queen then you probably are not going to understand why I said this book is a Red Queen fan fiction:•Adena: Mare’s sister. They both design clothes.•Kai: Cal but with a flirting personality (oh but let’s not forget that we have to force him into a dark “I don’t share my feelings cuz I’m a monster” character.) Also, what’s with Paedyn describing him as a cocky bastard and two pages latter saying that he was this mysterious guy 🧍🏻\u200d♀️.•Kitt: Naive prince who’s clearly becoming the villain at the end: Maven.⚔️And I could go on and on but honestly it bores me to tears to remember all of the characters because that’s what the story was: plain and boring(unnecessarily long).⚔️Like I said: a Fan fiction (dare I say that Red queen was at least more unique) and it felt as if the author wrote this and never check it before publishing it. It was like: here🤲🏻 theres this book that feels incredibly overwhelming and it has a lot of tropes that are a favorite on booktok but I didn’t develop them well.⚔️I’ve said this before and I’m gonna say it again: There is one book on Wattpad that includes royals and everything and it was 100% better than this “book”. So if you read books in Spanish you should definitely give it a try!!! It’s called EL PERFUME DEL REY. (And yes I read this recently so there is no: I read this in 2015 you’ll probably not like it now) The book is also in a physical copy!!! And has illustrations😍⚔️People recommend this saying that is very cheesy and it’s for a younger audience, when in reality there are BETTER books with VERY YA scenes like: Once upon a broken heart that were actually good (I’m 18)⚔️Anyway. I say, read this if you want to but I still think it’s not fair that you have to pay 20$ for something that copied basically everything from other popular books and everyone on booktok is hyping it knowing damn well this has a poor plot and it should be on Wattpad.⚔️Im gonna say this a last time: I paid for this book and I feel like at least I deserve to give my opinion on it and WHY I didn’t like it.I gave it 1⭐️ because Ik there could be more improvement and it’s also very impressive that somebody wrote 500 pages at 18!'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'This was not good. As a trending booktok book, I didn’t really know what I was getting into because those are always a bit of a toss up, but it was still one of my most anticipated releases.The main issue with Powerless is that it was written FOR social media. It was written around popular tropes even if putting in those tropes was completely out of place and forced. Now listen, I’m not against using popular tropes or anything, but they’re only effective if they come naturally and actually have a reason to be there. It felt completely unoriginal because I had read it all before.And it wasn’t just the tropes that made this book so unoriginal. I swear that this was just a carbon copy of The Hunger Games x Red Queen. The characters were all 2D versions of characters from the Hunger Game, the world building was literally the exact same as in Red Queen except if the Red Queen Universe hosted an annual Hunger Games, and the plot was just a bunch of copy and pasted moments from both. I understand that with fantasy books you’re always going to see some parallels between books, but this was insane. It was so so bad. Every page was deja vu and not in a good way. As someone who loved the Hunger Games (not Red Queen as much but I can respect it), some of this honestly felt a little disrespectful because it was so similar yet there was no meaningfulness or relevance to everything. THG is a commentary on our modern-day capitalist society and so many of the scenes and premises that were blatantly copied in this book actually held incredible importance in THG but were just thrown in with no meaning or thought whatsoever here.Then there was the romance, the reason we’re all here. I feel kind of 50/50 on this because Kai and Paedyn did have some “chef’s kiss” moments, but the tension was so overdone. When you put in so much sexual tension, there comes a point where it’s no longer tense. I also hated how Kai was always calling Pae “darling,” not because I hate that name or anything, but because it was used all the time and felt really forced. I also don’t understand all the nose flicking. Why was Kai always flicking Paedyn’s nose for no apparent reason. That will never not be weird. Nonetheless, it was one of the book’s better aspects which is great because it is, in fact, romantasy.The writing also wasn’t too bad, especially considering that this is a debut novel. However, the use of the term “ocean eyes” was literally criminal and I don’t think I’ll be able to listen to that song again (iykyk). Oh, and “cocky bastard” too. We can do better than that.The world building, like I said before, was completely unoriginal, but it also made about 0 sense. I mean, the whole idea behind the Purging Trials is so that the kingdom can showcase the power of the elites, but the whole thing was so flimsy. Like, you’re going to have a bunch of people with powers go fight each other (and kill each other, although it was never explained if that was the actual goal or what) and film them for… entertainment purposes? Don’t even get me started on the whole history with the Elites and Ordinaries with the Plague and everything. So many plot holes in this regard.I will say that this book was very entertaining and bingeable. Despite the fact that I kind of hated it, it still would be one of my go-to’s for a reading marathon or a long trip or something like that.In the end, this was a huge letdown for me. It really is an interesting example of how social media is effecting the book industry and, while I think there are some good things that come out of this, I really have a lot of issues with it. Honestly, Powerless was so formulaic that it almost felt like it was generated by AI (I know it wasn’t- I’ve been following Lauren Roberts on social media for a while and I’ve seen what she’s put into this book). I know the that a lot of people love this book but it wasn’t for me. 2 stars.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""What in The-Hunger-Games-Divergent-Serpent-and-the-Wings-of-Night-Throne-of-Glass-Young-Elites-Shatter-Me fandom mash-up is this?Disclaimer:I know nothing of the author and don’t keep up with BookTok books, so this review is unbiased in every possible way. Even in moments where I may diss the book, I have absolutely nothing against the author and am open to reading her future releases.That being said, I have lost faith in humanity.I truly do not understand the hype for this. At all. There are so many other, better written fantasy romance novels out there.It wasn’t just that this was unoriginal and bad writing, but the romance was awful, the characters bland, the plot pacing so damn slow with so many pointless scenes, and every plot aspect was absolutely RIDDLED with logistic issues. If you take the time to look at things for half a second, the whole thing falls apart irrevocably.This whole thing hinges upon tropes and other peoples’ nostalgia and love for to all the books I just listed above.People are actually recommending this to fans of The Hunger Games.For the love of God, if you are a true fan of The Hunger Games, DO. NOT. pick this up.This is SO bad that to compare it to that is to make a mockery of the franchise.The concept of The Hunger Games has a sick sort of logic to it that makes sense.This, whatever trials were in Powerless, did not make sense.So the whole conflict in this world is that the king basically kills all the powerless, called Ordinaries, and the Fatals, which are the those who have powers so strong they are a threat to everyone, Ordinary or Elite. He does this to keep the Elites strong and him in power, believing that reproducing with Ordinaries will deplete the Elite’s power overtime.Okay. Fine. But then why would you host the Purging Trials where many of your treasured elites might die?? Not only that, but to contradict again, it’s literally said multiple times that the trials are meant to showcase powers, not to kill other contestants. But with a name like the PURGING trials, what else do you think the contestests are going to do? Come on. Also, most of the contestants are literally childhood friends or acquaintances, and you’re telling me they’re nonchalantly killing them off, when it’s not even required to win the trials? I’m sorry, but I’m not rooting for or sympathizing with ANY of these sadistic characters. This isn’t morally grey, this is pure evil.Building upon the issues I’ve already brought up and my many questions that remain unanswered, the novel is a mess of plot holes.I’m sure most of this is due to the fact that the plot was not born from an idea—whether it be world, character, or plot based. It’s built from a trope, which is never a solid foundation for a book.I am so tired of this new trend of trope-dumping. Sure, tropes are nice, even amazing, in extreme moderation. And even then, thetropes should not be the driving force in a novel or even in plot progression.These are like literary devices, used to elicit a certain atmosphere or feeling, whether in the story or readers. Tropes do not a plot make. They are not a substitute, they are not character building, they are not even effective romance development techniques. So please, for all of our sake, let's move on!There are many more plot holes, but at this point my frustration over it all, while writing this, is becoming unhealthy so I’ll just stop while I’m ahead.There is nothing of substance to the characters.Nothing to differentiate them from one another and nothing to make them anything but the basic stereotypes of whatever role they’re intended to fulfill.Prince Kai is the worst of them all. He’s supposed to be some badass, monstrous assassin for the king. But nothing ever backs up these claims. In fact, Roberts goes so overboard on his charming nature (which is more cringeworthy than actually charming) and his romantic feelings for the FMC that he’s honestly softer than every other character in the novel. Result the exact opposite of the intention, I’m sure.Paedyn has the most pick-me energy that I’ve had the displeasure of reading in recent memory. She screams Wattpad fanfic on the basis of she has no flaws, her only weakness being her supposed love for others and her unparalleled heroism.The dialogue between characters is the worst.I could not keep my face straight when I read it; the secondhand embarrassment was worse than the experience of watching DUFF or Awkward. (Y’all know what I’m talking about, I know you do).The romance is terrible. I tried to think of a better way to put it, but I could not without altering the truth of the matter.Why, why, why do we follow this ridiculous love triangle between Paedyn and the two royal brothers, Kai and Kitt? For one, this screams heavily influenced by Red Queen. For another, the novel is literally a fantasy romance told from the perspectives of Paedyn and Kai. We know it’ll be their romance in the end, because Kitt’s POV is not included. So why waste our time? It literally adds nothing to the story.Onto the actual romance at the forefront of the novel, this is as insta-love as it can possibly get, folks. Sometimes, insta-love is called for, most of the time it’s not. Have I ever liked it either way? Absolutely the fuck not, there’s the door.🚪Kai and Paedyn have no chemistry. How could they when they’re lusting over one another from the moment they lay eyes on each other? Their romance goes from 0-100 REAL QUICK, and I’m talking 30% of the way in. Then, as if the author remembers that, actually, we need to slip the “slow burn” trope in, she decides the characters need to blatantly fawn over one another for damn near the rest of the book but do nothing about it. Literally, what is the purpose? The slow burn doesn’t hit the same if you’ve already solidified the romance in the first 100 pages.Anyway, I did not like this. Pick up some Carissa Broadbent instead, okay folks?""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '“But I’m never sober around you, Pae. Never not drunk on every detail that is you.”Infinity x Infinity 🌟’s⚔My Thoughts⚔Usually I am not into reading slow burn romance books. Like if they have a friends to lovers trope I’m not really interested in it bc its so slow at least in my opinion. Sometimes it can be at the very end of the book where the two characters kiss and it\'s just hard to wait that longi’m kind of impatient when it comes to romance 🙉BUT…. this book kind of changed my perspective a little bit. To say I really liked this is an understatement. It’s such a beautiful, playful and humorous book. The plot the characters especially the characters specifically the female character, PAE!!! She is such a inspiration to all people especially girls!! I just love the way she carried herself and just went through the competition with such grace, passion, and determination. This book also reminded me a lot of my favorite dark romance series Blood and Ash series. The threats of how stabbing turns people on is just giving Casteel from blood and ash and it was like living deja vu all over again. But yeah this book had a little something of everything and I loved it sm!! I will say as someone who isn\'t really a slowburn fan I’m thinking about reconsidering after reading this. 💗 Infinity x Infinity stars all around!!!⚔Main Characters⚔☘Pae☘This girl is my heart and soul!! I love her sm!! She is such a powerful female character. I love how she doesn’t try to just fit in with the other girls. Every chance she got she spoke up and expressed her feelings. And even when she wasn’t trying to she was so funny. Her relationship with Kai is just so cute and so romantic. Ik they didn’t really get a good kiss but Ik they’re is definitely something special for them in the cards. I really hope that she is still able to continue to being herself no matter what even after what happened. Usually its rare to get this much female agency throughout a whole book let alone a series so I’m hoping that she is able to just be true to herself and keep fighting for her relationship with Kai no matter what. Also can we just talk about the dresses she wore with the high slit and the dagger on her thigh and didn\'t even bat an eye at the traditional dresses that everyone had to wear that was all the same color. I’m talking badass girl right there!! 🎀💘💖☘Kai☘Kai is literally the book guy everyone wants. 😍He is so funny and smart. He cares sm eventho he doesn’t seem like he does at first. He literally spared people when he was supposed to kill them And ofc he is absolutely so handsome. Like I was giggling and kicking my feet he was just so cute and so entertaining to read about. And the way he always put caring for Pae over his other duties was just so thoughtful and he is literally on of the best mmc in like book history. And I loved when he was so attentive to Pae and always found some way to crack a joke while flirting was just so swoonworthy. 😋 Like idk how I’m going to survive while Reckless isn’t here yet. And there was one scene I loved sm when they were talking about feelings and she was trying to put her walls up and he like next time don’t tap your left foot and lie to me. Like somehow he just knew.⚔Side Characters⚔The were all pretty decent the best friend was my favorite. She was so sweet and I wish things could have been better (if you know you know) I’m not even going to talk about the father I didn’t like him at all. But the brother ofc I ended up liking him too especially when he was flirting with Pae 🙈 but midway I kinda just stopped idk why I just think he wasn’t that interesting like I thought.⚔Best Couple Moments⚔🌸Their 1st\xa0 meet up🌱Gifted her a knife🌸Kai putting food on Pae’s plate for her bc she was refusing to eat and she seemed shy🌱Their little fights🌸Their dance lessons🌱Everytime he called her darling🌸Her favorite color is blue bc she loves his eye color🌱He helped her through her panic attack🌸He wrote on his arm ‘she said I could touch her when I’m sober’🌱Pae comforting Kai during his nightmare🌸Their picnic in the garden⚔Favorite Scenes⚔▪︎“Do you always fall into the arms of handsome strangers, or is it a new thing for you?” (Kai)“No, only the cocky ones.” (Pae)“Well looks like I’ve made quite the first impression then.

I think it was kinda something we all knew partly bc of events that led up to it. However what happened with Kai was shocking bc usually stuff like that has gone differently but ih this was a new twist to the book which was so heartbreaking. And like the history with their fathers was crazy.

I'm Glad My Mom Died
",Jennette McCurdy,4.45,1186537,210172,"Nonfiction, Memoir, Audiobook, Biography, Autobiography, Mental Health, Adult",320,09-08-2022,"A heartbreaking and hilarious memoir by iCarly and Sam & Cat star Jennette McCurdy about her struggles as a former child actor—including eating disorders, addiction, and a complicated relationship with her overbearing mother—and how she retook control of her life.Jennette McCurdy was six years old when she had her first acting audition. Her mother’s dream was for her only daughter to become a star, and Jennette would do anything to make her mother happy. So she went along with what Mom called “calorie restriction,” eating little and weighing herself five times a day. She endured extensive at-home makeovers while Mom chided, “Your eyelashes are invisible, okay? You think Dakota Fanning doesn’t tint hers?” She was even showered by Mom until age sixteen while sharing her diaries, email, and all her income.InI’m Glad My Mom Died, Jennette recounts all this in unflinching detail—just as she chronicles what happens when the dream finally comes true. Cast in a new Nickelodeon series called iCarly , she is thrust into fame. Though Mom is ecstatic, emailing fan club moderators and getting on a first-name basis with the paparazzi (“Hi Gale!”), Jennette is riddled with anxiety, shame, and self-loathing, which manifest into eating disorders, addiction, and a series of unhealthy relationships. These issues only get worse when, soon after taking the lead in the iCarly spinoff Sam & Cat alongside Ariana Grande, her mother dies of cancer. Finally, after discovering therapy and quitting acting, Jennette embarks on recovery and decides for the first time in her life what she really wants.Told with refreshing candor and dark humor,I’m Glad My Mom Diedis an inspiring story of resilience, independence, and the joy of shampooing your own hair.","[{'rating': 4, 'content': 'Instagram||Twitter||Facebook||Amazon||PinterestSo in my pre-review of this book, where I lamented about not being able to find a copy anywhere because of all the HYPE (seriously, I could not find a copy of this anywhere and the library had, like, a five-hundred year wait-- thank GOD for my sister sending me a copy as payment for watching her kitten), I said that the people giving this author shit about her choice of title were dickheads. Some people got mad at me about that, but I stand by what I said. Even more so after reading this memoir. I am seriously side-eyeing the people defending the mother, actually, because based on the accounts in this memoir, she was verbally, emotionally, physically, and sexually abusive. Not only that, but she coached her daughter into an eating disorder at age eleven and then managed her to ensure that she continued to starve herself. That\'s not to mention the stage-parenting, the freak-outs (especially while driving), and the fact that she wiped Jennette when she went to the bathroom well into, like, her preteens (imagine not even trusting your eleven-year-old daughter to wipe her own ass) and showered her into her late teens (sometimes with her older brother and also while giving her breast and vaginal exams, ostensibly to search for cancer, I guess).What the FUCK.Here\'s a hard truth. Some people are shitty people. Some of those shitty people are shitty parents. Being a parent does not give you a free-pass from all wrongs. Especially if you\'re just doing the whole parenting thing for a little human-sized accessory that you can live all of your failed dreams through. By the end of this book, I was kind of glad Jennette\'s mother died, too. After living under that kind of suffocating parenting, with gaslighting and serious emotional trauma, not to mention abuse, I would be fucking done. I don\'t blame Jennette for her feelings. And I love my mother. I\'m lucky enough to have a pretty good relationship with her. And a few years ago, my mother got breast cancer, just like the author\'s mom, and I was so devastated that I felt like I was working in a total fog. I stepped back from social media and it was all I could do to focus on my day job because I was so upset. But I know that other people\'s experiences aren\'t like that, and we don\'t get to dictate how other people mourn (or choose not to). My mother ended up okay, but I would have been really sad if the worst happened, and that\'s because she was a good mom and she still works hard at being a good person. People who don\'t try to be good people are owed nothing. Why enshrine the dead if they leave behind a legacy of trash? The title is shocking but only because we tend to airbrush the pasts of the departed.I\'M GLAD MY MOM DIED rejects this premise. In this memoir, Jennette McCurdy lays out her upbringing in painfully explicit detail, starting from her mother\'s hoarding and growing up in poverty in a house that sounded like it should have been condemned, to the way her mother forced her into acting and she ended up being the golden goose that kept her family afloat after years of living hand to mouth. She talks about the way her mother emotionally manipulated her, and her guilt. She talks about how she started to get body dysmorphia because she felt like the only way she could continue to be successful was to look like a child forever, and when she expressed this fear to her mom, her mom taught her how to starve herself, starting an eating disorder that would basically rule her emotional breaks and her relationship with food for over a decade. She talks about her hatred of acting, what it was like working under the man she calls ""The Creator"" at Nickelodeon (we know who), her friendship with Miranda, and her jealousy and resentment of Ariana. And then she writes about her utterly conflicting feelings when her mother began to die of another bout of cancer, still manipulating her emotions.This book stressed me out so much. I think it would be very triggering for people with eating disorders and people with abusive parents, as it is SO descriptive when it comes to these passages. It\'s also a brand new look into celebrity, because most celebrity memoirs are written by people who are still in the business, but this is kind of a fuck-you memoir written by someone who doesn\'t care if their bridges are burned, so she really unhauls all the dirt in a way that someone who probably wanted to keep working in this field wouldn\'t. It\'s really well-written but the writing can, at times, feel a bit amateurish. McCurdy has a lot of raw talent but the people hyping her up as brilliant are exaggerating a little.ALSO, who the fuck is calling this book a ""hilarious"" memoir? Are these the same people who were talking about how ""funny"" CRYING IN H MART was? Is this where we open up the floor to a conversation about how women\'s emotional pain and fraught relationships are often mined for comedic value? Why do people find it so amusing when women hate their mothers? My review is already getting longer than I intended it to, but this is definitely a trend I\'ve noticed lately where I\'ll pick up a memoir that\'s supposed to be funny and instead it\'s just an emotionally wrenching book about a woman dealing with her trauma. Ha-ha, I guess. Fuck that.Doread this book, if you are in a healthy mental space, but gird yourself against the hype. It is not Jesus\'s Second Coming. It is just a very brave story about a woman trying to come clean with herself and the past.4 stars'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I\'m Glad Her Mom Died Too""Why do we romanticize the dead...?Indeed. Why do we?Before this book came out, my knowledge of Jennette McCurdy only extended to random gifs featuring heriCarlycharacter, Sam Puckett. I didn\'t actually know who she was and what they were from, I just knew they were funny and fit my ""book review"" purposes.Here\'s an example:When this book dropped, however, I was drawn to the title, the gloriously vintage macabre book cover, and the fact that it was getting rave reviews.I was excited to read this and loved the cover so much that I purchased the hardcover drop instead of waiting for my library hold. I initially started this in early September, but for personal reasons I won\'t get into, I had to set it down for a bit. I have almost no triggers and can read pretty much anything without being all that affected, but - again - for personal reasons I won\'t get into, I found the details of Jennette\'s mother\'s behavior, narcissism, and emotional manipulation to be extremely triggering. And don\'t even get me started on the eating disorder triggers. I was also amidst a fairly stressful period in my work life, so I decided to wait until that was over before picking this back up.Fast forward a little over a month and my library audiobook hold was by then available, so I decided to jump back in with that format. Let me just say that I can\'t recommend the audiobook version of this highly enough. It is obviously read by Jennette McCurdy herself and I think she does a great job of it.I think the dichotomies of Jennette\'s life and story are very interesting and well explained. She is able to get across very nuanced and contradictory sentiments without sounding like a complete whiner. And that\'s a really hard thing to accomplish in practice.For example, she is able to outline how, despite understanding how privileged and ""lucky"" she was to be famous and on TV, she loathed acting, a lot of the fans, and the experiences that came with it all.^See how assholey that\'s sounds just me saying it? Well, she nails it in the book, I promise you.I also felt very connected to Jennette and had a lot of empathy for her. I grew up in LA County and am VERY familiar with almost every location she references in the LA/Orange County area. I literally drive by the Westminster Mall (which she references being that she grew up in Garden Grove, and which is basically a nonexistent ghost mall now) every day on the freeway on my way to work.Also, I know I said I didn\'t want to get too woo-woo personal, but I will just say this: I deeply connected to Jennette in terms of understanding the longstanding effects (as a child who doesn\'t know any better) of being made to feel like you are responsible for the state of mind and emotions of another person - an ADULT person. For years.It steals your childhood, stunts you emotionally, and really takes a long time to work through.Some people should just NOT have children, folks. It\'s just that simple. I mean, what they say really is true: a lot of people spend their adulthood just trying to get over their childhoods. And that\'s even true for ""GOOD"" parents.But I digress.I liked how self-aware Jennette is. Or, at least, how self-aware she appeared to be in this book. That said, I also feel like this memoir came a little soon in terms of Jennette\'s recovery. She\'s very, very new to being on ""the other side"" of things. Although perhaps this book is a part of that, and so I can\'t fault her for that. And who am I to judge or criticize.Overall, this book was a great account of a very unique human experience. I will definitely check out any future books or content Jennette puts out in the future. And I\'m rooting for her, her recovery, and her happiness.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""praying that Jennette makes more from this book than Nickelodeon could’ve ever offered with their hush moneyA truly incredible and hard-hitting memoir.Whether you watched Jennette’s shows growing up (like me) or you don’t know her at all, I think this book is a must read. I don’t want to go into too many details, so I’ll just share some of my thoughts:• The writing is easy to read but still poignant. I think Jennette did a great job recounting the events of her life. I especially appreciate how she recounted her childhood; she really nailed writing from the perspective of a naïve child who doesn’t realize how awful her mother is.• I love how truthful Jennette was about her own fuck-ups. She admitted she was very aware of how bitter and rude she had become, and how ungrateful she seemed (obviously, I think she was justified).• I particularly loved the section about Jennette’s time on“Sam & Cat”. It showed how much her addiction, mental illnesses and eating disorders affected her work; how much Nickelodeon mistreated her, especially when compared to Ariana Grande; and how resentful she had grown over the years.•The exploitation of children in the entertainment industry is something that really needs to be discussed.Seeing a child star expose the abuse she suffered in the industry is truly heartbreaking, but extremely important, especially in this day and age, where even more parents are pressuring their children and forcing them to put themselves out there for fame. I wonder if in 10 years we’ll see similar testimonies from kids of family channels who grew up making money for their parents in an even more disgusting way: by having they entire lives documented and posted online for all to see.• Jennette’s friendship with Miranda was so wholesome <3• A bit of a critique: I feel like certain events were skipped and only mentioned later in the timeline (for example: we never see her audition for iCarly, or how filming the 1st episode was, suddenly it was already 3 years into the filming of the show, out of nowhere we find out that she’d been to multiple events and red carpets, she randomly mentions she knows she has OCD and EDs – I guess she learned and came to terms with it off-page…). Obviously, this is a memoir, so the author knows better than me what was important to document, but still, some of these things seemed kind of crucial in my opinion (especially her learning about her disorders).• The main reasons I’m giving it 4 stars is because memoirs are not really my thing, so I ended up not enjoying this as much as the other books I give 5 stars to; and because, as I mentioned, I think some things could’ve been a bit better. But, again, I still loved this book and highly recommend it to everyone!(review written on 24/08/2022)---this title isBRUTAL💀i'm so happy for her 😌 can't wait to read it!!(06/04/2022)""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Shall we light it up?A bridge.It’s time.When I was in middle school, my mother told me that my glasses were ugly, that the children would call me Four-Eyes.

Some parents are bottom 10% parents.It has been a long time since I have felt seen. The last book that I felt really conveyed the complexity of a dysfunctional parent-child relationship is The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls.Did I spend years trying to win my mother’s love? Yes.

Not dissimilar to my relationship with food and my body.Both of them feel like constant pulling, yearning, begging, fighting. I’m trying desperately to get their approval, their affection, and I never quite seem to. I’m never quite good enough.I cannot give this less than five stars, but it was horrible to read.This memoir wasn't initially on my radar because I wouldn't know McCurdy if she showed up at my front door. However, in the hours since I've finished this, I've felt compelled to familiarise myself with clips on Youtube. It gives me a chill to think that this bright talented young girl was concealing so much pain.The title is arresting, as it's supposed to be, but it's far more than just clickbait. McCurdy as an adult wrestles with her perception of her childhood and the pedestal she put her mother on. The mother who aggressively pushed her into acting, despite her protestations, then encouraged her anorexia and lied to doctors about it.It is hard, harder perhaps than I can even imagine, to revisit your past and understand that a person you have loved, admired and tried so long to impress has been a toxic presence in your life.People seem to assign thin with “good,” heavy with “bad,” and too thin also with “bad.” There’s such a small window of “good.”As well as this, it's a portrait of the ugly side of child acting. Reading this, I found myself feeling that surely no child can give informed consent to becoming an actor. They are pushed and pulled between adults who fixate on their appearance, who criticise them, build them up and reject them. No wonder former child actors have such a high rate of substance abuse and mental illness.McCurdy's experiences at home and within the industry left her with an unhealthy relationship with food, her body and being a woman, a relationship that she is finally beginning to reckon with after both her mother's death and her own decision to quit acting.Though I did not know her before starting this memoir, this book invited me deep inside her experiences. I now feel an overwhelming desperation for McCurdy to overcome the trauma of her past and find peace.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""As someone who’s never watched Nickelodeon or anything with this author, I was still highly engrossed in Jennette's story. You can tell she’s more passionate about writing than acting because her writing is of a higher caliber than other celebrity memoirs that were likely ghost-written. She describes events chronologically in such a detailed and engaging way, picking specific memories to demonstrate the dysfunction of her childhood. I appreciated her honesty, dry humor, and even her bitterness and negativity. Her train of thought is very similar to my own mentality (irritability, cynicism, being extremely critical of ourselves, etc) and having that mirrored back from another deeply wounded person was eye-opening. It makes me feel better knowing I'm not the only one who processes life this way... Can we do group therapy together, Jennette?!While I appreciate the level of detail in recalling these events (no easy feat for those dealing with trauma), I would’ve loved to see more reflections of the themes across the book, like her present-day thoughts on her family, Hollywood, child stardom, body image, etc. As well as her learnings from therapy that she’s incorporating moving forward, just to give the rest of us more hope!

She impacted me so much with her honesty and I can't thank her enough for writing not only a horrifying story but also a damn good book.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I was not a huge fan of Nickelodeon, and I watched their shows only once in a while during my childhood. Drake & Josh and iCarly were the two shows I watched. I particularly remember the part where Sam (Jennette McCurdy) talks about reading in iCarly, which became a famous meme.Her acting in iCarly was spot on and funny. Jennette did a brilliant job while acting, which is why people like me who rarely watched the show still remember her.Whenever we hear the name Jennette McCurdy a bubbly, loud, energetic young lady comes to our mind, as her friend Miranda Cosgrove mentions in this book. This book tells us that there were a lot of hardships and sorrow hidden behind those energetic and brilliant performances.Seven key ideas from this book1) If child labor is unethical, aren\'t child actors too unethical?During December every year, when it is nearer to Christmas, there is something that everyone all over the world (especially in America) will do. It is to rewatch the Home Alone movie. The family dynamics of the McCallister family, ingenious script by John Huges, brilliant direction by Chris Colombus, fantastic music by John Williams, and extraordinary production design and sets will make us relive our childhood. Home Alone is pure nostalgia for many people.Apart from everything mentioned above, the biggest factor that brings us back to rewatch Home Alone is the amazing acting by Macaulay Culkin. I was shocked when I heard that he had to sacrifice his entire childhood to entertain us. He was abused both physically and mentally by his jealous father. The law caught him with marijuana possession. He was arrested for speeding and many other illegal activities. The abuse has affected his mental health, which pushed him into addiction.Parents using their children as money-making machines by making them actors and making them overwork for different movies when they should be going to school has been a severe issue in the life of many child actors.If we closely observe the career graph of child actors, we can see that only very few become great actors when they grow up.In Jennette\'s story also, we can see that she was not at all interested in acting. But her mother forced her to act even from the age of six. Nobody even cared to ask her what Jennette liked to do. She tells in this book that she hated acting, which is why she quit acting after her mother died.If child labor is unethical, then child actors are also unethical. Then the million-dollar question of who will do the children\'s role in the movies will arise. If child actors were not there, how would they have made movies like Harry Potter, where most of the main actors are children?“I HATE ACTING CLASS. Even though it\'s a chunk of time away from Home, I don\'t look forward to this class the same way I look forward to church because I find acting even more uncomfortable than being stuck at Home.""2) How did the ""Creator"" make Jennette\'s life miserable?This is another big problem child actors face, the predators on the shooting sets. The author mentions a ""creator"" who behaved harshly toward her. This same creator also allegedly misbehaved with some other crew members in a sexually inappropriate way.We have heard about many child stars who were sexually harassed on the shooting sets. Some even make them work overtime, destroying the younger kids\' enthusiasm and courage.I think the only way to prevent child actors from being exploited by parents and crew members is by appointing an internal committee in every shooting set that even has access to mental health care professionals if needed. This committee should ensure that a certain percentage of children\'s earnings should be solely used for children\'s personal needs like education. This will prevent the children from being monetarily misused by their parents.It is challenging to implement this as different countries have different rules and procedures. A very few countries have tried to implement a similar method. But they were all disasters due to their lack of planning and coordination. If Hollywood and people in the USA start implementing it perfectly, all the countries may slowly follow it. A similar rule should be implemented for the children on social media (especially a few family channels on youtube.), even though it will be a little bit more complicated to implement in those cases.“Cut!” The Creator yells off camera, his mouth full of something.""“But our wardrobe designer said that The Creator explicitly asked for bikinis, and so she had to at least have me try on one or two of them so he had the option. ”3) How are children\'s life affected by their narcissistic parents?Falling into a narcissistic romantic relationship is a harrowing experience. Being the daughter of a narcissistic mother is a much more painful experience. This book shows how her mother totally controlled her daughter\'s life. The author tells us how proper medical help and therapy after such a long physical and mental abuse helped her recover from such abysmal despair.""My mother emotionally, physically and mentally abused me in ways that will forever impact me.""""I realize that she\'s happy and I\'m not. Her happiness came at the cost of mine. I feel robbed and exploited.""4) Do we need to romanticize the dead?This is a tough question to answer. Some say objectivity is born after a person dies. It is true that death changes the light in which we see people. But up to what extent? Can mourning alternate realities?These are a few among the many questions I have asked myself after reading one book some time ago on this topic. The author brings this topic back into the limelight.Some people say it is better to speak about the positive sides of the dead person during the time of grief, but not focus on their negative facets as everybody also has a negative side to their personalities along with the positives. But what will we do if the person only has a negative side and the positive side is almost nil? I think it is better to remain silent than to focus on the negatives during mourning.These are the questions that we should contemplate a lot before answering. The answers to the above questions vary depending on the individual\'s personality and character.“Why do we romanticize the dead? Why can\'t we be honest about them? Especially moms, they\'re the most romanticized of anyone. ”5) Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosaBoth anorexia and bulimia are eating disorders. In anorexia, people restrict their food intake to lose weight. In bulimia, people will eat an excessive amount of food in a short period of time and then purge them using various methods to prevent weight gain. Both these disorders will cause severe health problems. For examplein bulimia due to repeated trauma to the esophagus due to vomiting gastric acidic contents, the person can develop esophageal adenocarcinoma.So, this is a serious medical problem that healthcare professionals should treat.""Jennette, what you\'re describing is... really unhealthy. Your mother essentially condoned your anorexia, encouraged it. She... taught it to you. That\'s abuse.""6) Friendship.Building a good friendship takes a lot of time, effort, and sacrifice. We can see the author talking about friendships in this book. I remember reading about different types of friendship in a book.Friendships can be classified into three.-1) Friendship of pleasure - Friendship ends when the enjoyment and fun end.- 2) Friendship of convenience - Friendship ends when the convenience factor end.- 3) True friendship - Friendship based on mutual respect.The author mentions that she dislikes friendship of convenience.""I don\'t like knowing people in the context of things. ""Oh, that\'s the person I work out with. That\'s the person I\'m in a book club with. That\'s the person I did that show with."" Because once the context ends, so does the friendship.""7) What is the problem with comparing our life with that of successful people?In this age of social media, every one of us has a tendency to know more about the life of successful people from their social media profiles and compare our life with theirs. The biggest problem is that people only post the positive side of their lives on social media. So checking others\' Instagram profiles and comparing our life to others can push us into anxiety and depression.In Jennette\'s case, she had Ariana Grande as the co-star in one of the shows, and she developed a habit of comparing her life with Ariane\'s. This is a habit we should never develop, and the author tells us all the troubles she had to face due to this behavior.""The third is that Ariana is at the stage in her career where she\'s popping up on every 30 Under 30 list that exists. And I\'m at the stage in my career where my team is excited that I\'m the new face of Rebecca Bonbon, a tween clothing line featuring a cat with her tongue sticking out. Sold exclusively at Walmart. And I frequently make the mistake of comparing my career to Ariana\'s. I can\'t help it. I\'m constantly in the same environment as her, and she doesn\'t exactly try to hide her successes.""My favourite three lines from this book""Suddenly, I feel just like that little eleven-year-old girl who was confused and scared and uncertain. That eleven-year-old girl who was doubtful that I knew the whole truth of my situation, who was unsure that my mother was the hero she pretended to be, but who shoved that doubt down.""""I don\'t like when grown-ups make faces or sounds that I don\'t understand. It\'s frustrating. It makes me feel like I\'m missing something.”""And the kids who are annoying, don\'t take direction, ask questions—those are the kids who won\'t get sent out on auditions. The kids who will get auditions are the ones who shut up and do as they\'re told.""What could have been better?The title of this book is a brutal one. I think Jennette should have given it a much more positive title. This current title will indeed pull the attention of many new readers to this book. But it also has its demerits. Whenever the author hears or sees the name of this book in the future, the first emotion that will come to her mind might be anger and sadness just because of this title.I can never tell that the author should have forgiven her mother as she had to suffer a lot due to her. But still, I think the title is brutal, and it should have been a different optimistic one.Rating5/5This celebrity memoir might be a difficult book, but you should never miss the opportunity to read it.You can also follow me onInstagram|YouTube First Channel|YouTube Second Channel|Twitter|Snapchat|facebook|TikTok'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Shit, I'm glad her Mom died too.""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I’m happy Jennette was able to tell her story and show how terrible it is to have such an abusive mom and what the entertainment industry can do to a child.My rating does not reflect how true and important the telling of her story is.The writing of the story however, was very painful to get through. It could have been edited better with how repetitive it is. It also has no self reflecting within the story, not that she isn’t a victim cuz she is. How she viewed other women and other women friendships also bothered me. I can see how coming from such a competitive career like acting could HAVE caused that but, I would HAVE loved to see some self-reflecting on that part as well.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Chances are, if you have a TikTok or Instagram you know what this book is. I mean,I'm Glad My Mom Diedwas on back order already the morning it was published and was a sought after title all August and is a book you just cannot avoid if you have an internet connection or local bookstore. Nor should you. Jennette McCurdy, the formeriCarlyactress, speaks so openly and candidly about a lifelong cycle of abuse and dependency with her mother (who passed in, as the title likely led you to assume), chronicling trauma and serious mental health struggles such as eating disorders that all were brought upon her through the need to serve her mother’s wishes. It’s one I’ve had right in everyone’s faces at the bookstore since we finally got copies, as the title is sure to solicit reactions and I privately enjoy seeing them, but also it is an important look at abuse and recovery. I had to finally read it. I mean we all deserve a Hot Girl Summer but can I truly say I had one if I didn’t read any Colleen Hoover, Beach Read or at least this, the most popular book of the end of summer? No. And I’m glad I did pick this up to read at work because this deserves all the hype and more, and I hope this is another success on McCurdy's road to improved mental health. While she loved her mother, their relationship was often abusive and left a lot to detangle in adulthood. Deeply personal and moving, this is a look into McCurdy's life as well as a necessary warning about the ways young girls are objectified, commodified and exploited, even by those closest to them.‘I realize that she’s happy and I’m not. Her happiness came at the cost of mine. I feel robbed and exploited.’That line says it all, honestly. This is an upsetting account of McCurdy's life, and one where all the warning signs were out in the open and ignored. Especially by Nickelodeon who don’t exactly come across well here. We’ve heard horror stories about the treatment of child actors for as long as there have been child actors, though this isn’t simply another case file of grievances but a really heartfelt self-examination and testimony. McCurdy comes across as very open and honest, and it really paints a positive look at her as a person who has gone through so much. There are times when she discusses the anger she felt, which feels justified and asSoraya Chemalytalks about in the bookRage Becomes Her: The Power of Women's Anger, sometimes anger is the appropriate response in order to not be silenced or ignored. It can be an important tool, or an armor as McCurdy describes:‘I became an angry person with no tolerance for anyone. I'm aware of this shift and yet have no desire to change it. If anything, I want it. It's armor. It's easier to be angry than to feel to pain underneath it.’She also expresses feelings of regret for having lashed out in these times, looking at how abuse shouldn’t just beget another cycle of abuse, and these discussions seem to come from a place of maturity and healing. It is likely very encouraging and empowering for victims of abuse to read much of this book, though heads up, it does get into some very triggering situations and topics.‘Mom only sits in when I’m being the thing she wanted to be.’McCurdy shows how so much of her life was lived to be what her mother wanted, and much of this became painful. She was raised in a Mormon household and was homeschooled by her mother, a mom who wanted to always present a perfect image and often lashed out hurtfully. In short, McCurdy is open about her mom having narcissistic tendencies, and while she is still caring for her mother (she does make it clear she very much loved her mother), the scars are quickly apparent. From years of life like this, McCurdy felt she lacked an authentic self, and this carried over into struggles with body image from seeing one’s own self as an object that serves others instead of something personally only yours. This is a major theme in the essays inMy BodybyEmily Ratajkowskifor those looking for further reading on the subject. When fearing her breasts would grow during puberty, the mother encouraged extreme calorie reduction and dangerous dieting practices. While discussions of the mother bookend this memoir, the bulk of the middle portion is about eating disorders. Most tragic is the moment in the hospital with her siblings saying goodbye to her mother when she says the one thing she thinks could actually make her mother proud of her:‘I'm in the ICU with my dying mother, and the thing that I'm sure will get her to wake up, is the fact that in the days since mom has been hospitalized, my fear and sadness have morphed into the perfect anorexia motivation cocktail, and finally I have achieved mom's current goal weight for me: 89 pounds.’There is a lot to be said about the ways this reflects a general attitude around young women and girls, especially in the entertainment industry and how it robs them of their own agency. ‘I was conditioned to believe any boundary I wanted was a betrayal of her, so I stayed silent,’ she writes, and in this we see how these systems perpetuate themselves: silence. Young women and girls are broken down to believe they are in service to another (we could get into a long discussion on how this is the social framing inflicted by the intersections of misogyny and capitalism) and silence is induced by making them first feel they wouldn’t be believed or listened to but also that they deserve it, it’s for their own good or that they don’t even have the agency to speak out. It is truly tragic how often victims of abuse are silenced when they do speak out, which is another tool in oppression.So this book is a lot, but it is also very good and seems very healing. I was under the impression based on how it was presented and marketed that this was more of a comedic memoir, so heads up if that was what you assumed as well, but the weight and power of her words as she discusses a lifetime of abuse is definitely worth reading for. It does read very plainly, almost like a “class assignment” type of tone recounting events, though they are certainly difficult memories to have to revisit. I hope McCurdy is doing well, and it is very honorable of her to use her experience to reach out and help others in this way. There could have been more depth to some of it, but this is less a look at the causes and social critiques and more at the personal effects she endured. There are great reminders too about how to move forward and not get bogged down in being perfect, such as when she writes that ‘slips are totally normal. When you have a slip, it’s just that. A slip. It doesn’t define you. It doesn’t make you a failure. The most important thing is that you don’t let that slip become a slide‘. I won’t get too much more into it, as you should probably read the book and this is McCurdy's story to tell, but I am very glad I read this.'My mom didn't get better.

It didn’t help the fact that writing the memoir focusing on traumas and single events, each one of them taking up one short chapter, made the “narration” very disjointed.The blurb is also very unfaithful to the actual content of the book: this memoir was described as “heartbreaking” and “hilarious”, and I have my doubts about the latter.

A very revealing and honest memoir. Unsure what parts people found funny.

Hearing Jennette’s story is another example of how you don’t know what’s happening to someone behind closed doors. As talented as she was in acting, I’m glad she made the decision to walk away. No one should be forced into a career they never wanted - especially a career as draining and consuming emotionally, mentally and physically as acting.Her mother’s abuse was tough to hear. It’s more painful to see how much Jennette wanted to appease her mom all the way until the very end of her life. She consistently put her mom’s needs before her own and her mom would willingly exploit and manipulate her knowing this.The title and cover is alarming and provocative but justified. If you assume Jennette never loved her mother, the story proves the exact opposite. The title is not a reflection of Jennette but the treatment of her mother towards her. Her mother severely betrayed and abused her and Jennette loved her while she was alive despite it. But time and healing allowed her to see the long term damage her mother has done and some damage is irreversible. Her story sheds more light to how we shouldn’t turn a blind eye to all the different forms, relationships and dynamics abuse can happen. If anything, parental abuse should be looked at with the utmost seriousness due to the power dynamic and pressures to love your family despite their faults, even when they hurt you.I could go on, but if any part of her story interests you, I would recommend reading.

Which is tricky when a facilities mishap means they are forced to share a rink with the figure skating team—including Anastasia, who clearly can’t stand him.But when Anastasia’s skating partner faces an uncertain future, she may have to look to Nate to take her shot.Sparks fly, but Anastasia isn’t worried . . . because she could never like a hockey player, right?","[{'rating': 5, 'content': 'Update: I just read the bonus chapters and ugh I’m in dire need of my very own Nate, please and thank you <3Edit: everyone asking for the bonus chapters — sign up to the authors newsletter and you will get an email with the password to access the bonus chapters.***You know when you read a book and you feel like if you don’t read it in one sitting then you’ll enjoy it less because the rush of the newness leaves and its appeal dies down?? Yeah, this was 𝗡𝗢𝗧 that.This book was EVERYTHING. I MEAN 𝑬𝑽𝑬𝑹𝒀𝑻𝑯𝑰𝑵𝑮.I’ve highlighted so much. WAY TOO MUCH 🙆\u200d♀️I read this so slowly because I knew when it would be over I’d be a wreck.

The diversity in this book was amazing to see!There was not a 𝗦𝗜𝗡𝗚𝗟𝗘 dry page. Not one. I drank every damn page like it was my only source of water.This wasn’t the typical third-act conflict type of book. NOPE. It was riddled with ups and downs but you can’t help but feel everything with these characters. It had depth and was plain amazing till the freaking end.

𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐒𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐋 𝐌𝐎𝐌𝐄𝐍𝐓𝐒.They gave me all the feels. The soft touches. Him randomly tucking her hair behind her ear. Her just staring at him bc he’s so damn hot. The forehead kisses.

This man is the most caring, reckless and loving creature that managed to work his way into my soul. He’s so thoughtful and his inner monologue is so funny. But their banter is even better 🤌❤️\u200d🔥He actually had his own life in this book too. Sometimes dual povs just feel like one because they’re both living the same thing. But this book showed the distinction between their thought processes and how they’re actual individuals, not the same brain.Gosh, 𝗔𝗡𝗔𝗦𝗧𝗔𝗦𝗜𝗔 𝗔𝗟𝗟𝗘𝗡 was so relatable. It was so hard seeing her go through all that shit but watching her grow stronger and healthier was so rewarding. I’m so proud of how she dealt with things.I loved how she became amazing friends with the team and cared about them like family. I loved her for saying what she wanted and sticking to it too. I’m so glad she had a spine and stood up for herself when it mattered.I’m genuinely so impressed this is a debut novel and I cannot WAIT to read more from Hannah Grace!!Whew!

I haven’t read something so unentertaining in a long time and only wasted my time for ten long hours.The book was way too long and too much. Too much drama, too much plot, too much was happening. I was half way into it when I already forgot what happened before because it.was.just.to.much, of everything. I wanted to dnf this book 10% into it, because it was so boring, but I never dnf a book before so I wanted to keep going. But it was just awful. I couldn’t wait until I finally (FINALLY) got to the end. (Have to confess I also skipped a few parts, mainly Anastasias chapters, halfway through the book because these awful, boring scenes weren’t bearable anymore after a few hours into it.)Aaron was a walking red flag since his introduction. I didn’t like him for a second (he gave me major bipolar disorder vibes with his mood swings). His character was awful und I didn’t enjoy a second of him being in this book. I understand that he was the main villain, but he shouldn’t have so much scene time. The main part of this book was for me hating him and I couldn’t enjoy anything beside because the next second he was back again and my mood fell. I don’t understand how people could keep up with him for so long, he clearly was a bad person (even if dumb Anastasia says other wise).Sabrine I liked just fine, but it’s doesn’t sit right with me reading about her behaviors while she is representing a muslim girl (or I suspect she is muslim because most of Algerians are), but I don’t know if she is for sure.Beside her there were too many side characters, I can’t even remember everyone who was there and why they were there.It’s shocking but the one person I disliked more than Aaron was Anastasia herself. Her whole character was so so so unlikable for me. Her freak-outs, how bad she treated Nathan even though he was always nice to her. The on, off, cold, hot she gave him and how she only liked him when she was drunk was annoying and irritating. Sometimes she acted like the biggest child and I hate how no one stood up to her and beat her in place, because she was such a mean person sometimes to the people around her (mainly Nathan who she always attacks without even knowing if he done anything wrong). She deserved to end up losing everything she worked towards. These „getting under his skin“ actions were unnecessary and childish. It was not funny at all and I hate Nathan for playing along with her every time she fucked him over again.It’s paradox how she is portrayed as a dominant, strong willed character with everyone else, but she lets Aaron walk over her over and over again till the last 2 chapters.I really hated her for every second she was present in this book more than I hated Aaron.What was Ryan’s purpose? He was a major part for the first half of the book but in the end he wasn’t even mention. Like he didn’t exist and the author just forgot he was there once. But he also is a person I didn‘t like. He was nice and all but he was interested in Olivia, wants more while laying half naked in a bed with another woman ? Kuddling her ? I wouldn’t want to talk to a boy who is seeing other girls beside me, let alone doing sleepovers with his ex-fuck-buddy.The only part of this book I liked was Nathan’s character. He was cute and polite, respectful, a green flag boy the whole time (even when he was mad that is girlfriend was fucked over and blinded by another man, as he should). He was attentive and always courteous. He cared for others more than he cared for himself. He took care of Anastasia, of his team, his sister. He was totally a golden retriever with a heart of gold. I wish he hadn’t ended up with Anastasia. He clearly deserves something so much better than her. Someone who loves him as equal as he loves, and Anastasia’s wasn’t that. She was just awful to him, treats him poorly and didn’t deserve him or his kindness.This one star is for Nathan and Nathan only.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'To sum up my thoughts very quickly… there was too much going on and yet somehow there was also absolutely nothing going on - so out of a weird mix of annoyance and boredom, I DNFd it at 50%But in case your interested in details…I should have realized right away that I wasn’t gonna like this book when I had a really hard time digesting the writing. There was something about it that wasn’t flowing smoothly from the pages into my brain and therefore I was reading it really slowly and found myself putting it down a lot (which is a very bad sign)Then there was also so much info-dumping for all the side characters. It felt like she already pre-planned out a multi book companion series and was trying too hard to get us invested in all of the side characters by giving them each so much detail and page time.We’ve got her best friend (Liv) who’s starting to get with his best friend (Robbie). Her skating partner (Aaron) who’s mentally and emotionally abusive to her (but she doesn’t realize this even though she’s been in therapy for years and supposedly is really good at expressing her thoughts and figuring out how she’s feeling… but okay.) There’s also a bunch of guys from the hockey team that end up becoming a part of this large friend group that’s forming (JJ, Henry, Russ, Bobby + more). Did I forget to mention Robbie? Yea, he’s Anastasia’s fuck buddy at the beginning of the book because she doesn’t have any interest in committing to a relationship because she just wants to focus on her training and skating career…. but it’s okay because early on he ends up starting a relationship with someone that Liv (Anastasia’s best friend) absolutely hates… so now her and Robbie are just best friends who sleep in the same bed together without shirts on sometimes… nbd (🙄)Then there’s Nate. He’s a sweetie and I liked him enough - but not enough to keep reading. Especially because I really didn’t like Anastasia. As for their relationship… I didn’t like that either. It was a-lot of tell and no show - and the few times there was show and they actually had a minute alone with each other, they would just get it on (yawn).As for the actual plotline - there was none. Yup. None — Basically all these characters meet for the first time when they are forced to start sharing an ice rink and that’s basically just a setup for them all to become friends… and then the rest of the story (from what I’ve read) is just watching them do everyday college shit like go to parties and bars and study and go to training and boring things like that.The funny thing is, is that right at the halfway point is when we get the second half of what was mentioned in the synopsis… where Aaron (the abusive skating partner) causes a ton of drama by getting injured and blaming it on Nate - so Nate ends up getting benched for a while and decides to fill in as Anastasia’s new skating partner…. and that’s right around where I gave up on the story.… and I’m just sayin… don’t put something in the synopsis if it’s not gonna happen until midway through - IMO the synopsis should only have information that takes place in the first 50-100 pages… but what do I know?So to sum all that up again… there were too many characters, too much drama, and somehow there was nothing actually going on other than all these people hanging out a bunch and Anastasia getting it on with Nate every time she was drunk and horny.Is it crazy to say that I have so much more I could complain about?? Even after my longest review ever?? It’s fine, I’ll stop myself here… but just know… I had more.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Is this what kids are into nowadays? Am I too ancient, too old, too out of touch with reality to understand what gen Z likes?""stop slapping your balls this loud""""her ass smells so good""""can Lola really hear my balls?""Yes, these are all quotes from this book.Well... there was zero plot. Every single character talked like they were 15 and just found out about sex through giphs on tumblr. And honestly, sex is the only thing they talk about. Every single page. There is nothing but: who\'s hooking up with who, how many kinky things they\'ve done, waking up and training while wasted from the parties they went to the night before, and how loud his balls are against her thighs when they\'re having sex.The FMC has a hardcore/severe eating disorder. AND THERE IS LEGIT A SENTENCE WHERE THEY EXCUSE A GUY KNOCKING SOMEONE UP BY SAYING:oh, it wasn\'t his fault, he doesn\'t know a lot about pregnancy. he\'s a good guy, he\'s just a 25 year old MAN who doesn\'t understand how sex works. so you gotta give him a pass.But yeah, if you want to know what this one is about, it\'s just a wattpad book that hasn\'t been edited. But I guess these are the books that get publisher deals nowadays.There are too many characters that are introduced in a very confusing way. They get yelled at by their coaches every 10 pages and talk about sex and alcohol for the remaining pages. Rinse and repeat. They all end up sharing a rink and spend a lot more time together, yatta, yatta.It\'s not the worst book I have ever read. But... It is written like a Wattpad story. Repetitive, long and childish.

Stupid instalove shit with a self righteous poorly executed “girlboss” mc who’s whole personality is being sassy and shallow but really she’s fighting demons 🥺🥺🥺🥺 SHUT UP and the love interest is somehow even worse at the beginning of the book he’s said to be in love with a girl and wants to marry her but completely forgets she even exists upon meeting Anastasia? By the way “Stassie” is one of the ugliest nicknames I’ve ever heard in my life. Bitch isn’t the Loch Ness monster.SECOND OF ALL the way he’s immediately like “omg I would do anything to hear Stassie’s laugh again 😍” SHUT THE FUXKKKKK UP YOU JUST MET HER PLEASE LIKE it’s actually painful and So Fucking Forced too. They don’t have two molecules of chemistry to rub together. You can tell the author was literally forcing infatuation on Nathan.THIRD OF ALL the plotline is ass. The author is clearly going for an enemies-to-lovers but Anastasia shouldn’t have even been mad at Nathan in the first place because it was over a minuscule predicament that wasn’t even remotely his fault. “I was planning on being mad at you forever” OVER FUCKING WHAT???? Id get it if she didn’t like him because he’s a useless pushover douchebag who’s literally obsessed with her but she doesn’t even gaf about that. It’s just cuz his teammates ex girlfriends boyfriend or some shit, who he has nothing to do with, fucked up their rink.FOURTH OF ALL nobody in this book has any decorum or home training. Why does Anastasia never wear any goddamn underwear to SOCIAL OUTINGS?Nessie went commando to someone’s BIRTHDAY PARTY. And I’m not sure about you but I wouldn’t want my boyfriend sleeping in another woman’s fucking bed because they’re “best friends” *COUGH* RYAN *COUGH*. And these bitches are talking about sex and literally Having sex in Ubers like MANNERS. THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE FUCKING CAR OH MY GOD.And for a final note: just how much I hate this stupid useless couple😊 Nathan saying he won’t fuck Anastasia when she’s drunk and 1) Nessie getting literally offended by him saying no and going back to being a complete self righteous bitch FOR NO REASON (for a modern day “woke” book the word “no” doesn’t seem to mean as much when you “don’t take rejection well”! (Stfu!!! No Consent is no consent!)) and 2) they fuck literally a couple days after even though she’s drunk AGAIN.

I didn't like the heroine because she was presented as someone determined and focused on her career as a figure skater, but all her actions towards that goal made her look childish and annoying for me because of the way she treated those around her, as if they were disposable, and almost as if she was doing them a favor by giving them the time of day, when at the end of the day she was always the one who came back for more because of that feeling of familiarity she didn’t had before.2. There were too many side characters that I couldn't keep track of, and at some points they stole the limelight in this book, while others became more and more annoying with each intervention (Henry please shut up, you stopped being quirky like 20 chapters ago). Also I don't wanna be like that, but I really feel like the author tried too hard to score those rep points while not even using google translate properly.3. And then the plot dragged and dragged, forever and ever, AMEN. I heard this was a Wattpad story before and maybe that's why the whole plot feels a bit cut off, but gosh, a new conflict after a few chapters? It was a few conflicts too much.

I’m a delight.”my main problem with the main character:she tried too hard to be grumpy.she was also super overdramatic and she swore to hate hockey players bc of a typical stereotype but one interaction and she realizes she starts to like them. the next thing she does is complain bc she was only willing to like henry. it was infuriating and annoying with how she tried hating all the hockey players. her inner dialogue was so hard to put up with because of the way she simply talked. she was WAY too stubborn for my liking and i did not like it at all. i’m so glad she gave up that behavior bc i wouldn’t have been able to stand the book if it continued like that.i thought there were times where i did seem to understand anastasia. she reminded me of monica geller with the way she was described! from her competitive nature to the way she was “compulsively organized”. it’s also clear how she cares a lot about the people she loves. however they differed in many different ways with how “grumpy” she is and her demeanor around new people.a small spoiler for this quote possibly!!“It felt good hearing him make plans for the future, and I could pretend I don’t know why, but denial is useless at this point. Everything he says makes me melt, and half the time I don’t know how to react, so I kiss him, then things escalate, and before I know it, I’m screaming his name and seeing stars.”—this was one of the many examples within this book that shows there’s no plot, it’s justsex driven.overall, this book wasso slow. it might seem fast paced with the events, but it slowly eased into a normal routine of them fucking every other chapter. it becomes so boring to read the same damn thing every time. it throws you off at the beginning just as an excuse to slow down the plot and focus on them doing it. however this book was great with keeping everything consistent. the amount of pages for each chapter stayed relatively the same and they didn’t favor one pov over another!if u saw my reaction while i read this book, you’d be familiar with these quotes.“I swear to God I will leave you in this airport,” Nate grumbles, slapping my ass, laughing when the noise causes an elderly couple to turn around and look at us, making my cheeks blush.”“It’s like he flicks a switch somewhere and suddenly it’s Niagara Falls between my legs.”mid way this book became entertaining. not for the plot, which remainedboring and gave us nothing. but i genuinely laughed out loud bc of how cringy the writing was sometimes & how it gave off wattpad vibes. the writing itself was entertaining. there was so much smut and usually i don’t mind but there was unnecessarily too much in this book. what was the purpose?? i was going to give this book 3 stars at this point. things were looking up and my rating slowly increased. i also liked the banter between the characters! it was pretty enjoyable on my part so there’s thatusually books that bring comfort involve the found family trope, but it’s not as present in this book mainly bc it focuses on friendships between the boys and anastasia, but even then it’s barely talked about there. plus, the main focus was the relationship between nate & anastasia, which in of itself is all abt sex. my favorite part is definitely the cooking lessons that jj and anastasia had together. cutest!!context: literally just gray sweatpants“He’s in a Maple Hills Titans T-shirt and gray sweats, and I hate myself for being a woman swayed by a man in gray sweatpants. Shit. No, there will be no swaying.””Gray, obviously, because Nathan Hawkins is a man who was most definitely written by a woman.”i hate nathan with a burning passion. this is the rare occasion where iWANTEDa third act conflict. i usually hate them butthey needed it!!he was below the bare minimum. i truly have no idea how anastasia put up with him. she likes a man who wears gray sweatpants and claims he is written by a woman. i wear gray sweatpants!! does that make me written by a woman? i would hope so but that’s besides the point.not every person who wears sweatpants immediately makes them written by a woman!spoilers from this point on“You think he’s going to manipulate her into forgiving him and then she won’t need you anymore. You like being needed by her. It makes you feel important. You know Aaron hates you and you think he’s going to keep her away from you. Which just shows you don’t know how strong she is, or truly understand how much she loves you.”“I shouldn’t have to scream that I’m not naïve or being manipulated for Nathan to trust my judgment. I shouldn’t have to beg him to understand that there is a difference between friendship and partnership.”these quotes single handedly ruined this book for me and made me hate nathan.nathan desperately needs therapy.i’m surprised she put up with the attitude that he showed her. i wanted him to be able to work out his feelings on his own so she would never have to put up with a man who cannot communicate his feelings bc communication is key!! instead they got pissed at each other and would put off arguements. then they don’t see each other for a few days and everything is fixed! i do appreciate the boys knocking some sense into him.“There’s a warm, full feeling in my heart when I’m around this team. It’s unfamiliar but familiar at the same time; a contradiction, I know, but so specific that it feels like it was specifically designed for me. It’s the feeling I didn’t know I needed until these guys crashed their way into my life three months ago.”speaking of the boys:i don’t see why people like henry.he made a LOT of backhanded comments to everyone and whether or not he can tell if it’s mean, i’m surprised they put up with him for so long. i do see that he cares for anastasia but from the beginning he was so blunt. there was ONE scene of henry being kind. he wasn’t even funny! he just had no filter and just cannot control his honesty. if he was able to control his honesty, i’d probably like him better.this book was so fast paced for the characters. this all happened within the span of 3 months.3 MONTHS.i get that the idea of the story is supposed to be that they don’t have any miscommunications and have a “healthy” relationship but i’ve found some problems within this situation. they move way too quickly and the way they address it as “we’ve spent so much time together so we’re built different” does not work for me. don’t get me wrong, they had their cute moments but it wasn’t enough to suffice for me.they don’t fight when they’re “frenemies” which i do appreciate but it’s obvious they wanted different things from the beginning. despite nathan knowing what anastasia wanted, they still got jealous whenever one hung out with another person and they didn’t address it. i feel like they sugarcoated everything and it’s clear anastasia doesn’t think on it much simply because she does not know how he feels. i’ve never met a man who’s happy to be her friend rather than upset that she just wants to be friends.here’s where the book gets confusing: they are obviously involved with one another but not exactly in a relationship type way. they don’t even get together until chapter 30. i honestly stopped caring for their relationship bc i was that done with this book. i thought nathan was desperate and i just did not like them together all that much. sure, they can be cute but their whole relationship and personality revolves around fucking one another and when they were away all they would think abt is alone time between them.the supposed “plot” on the back doesn’t happen until mid way. sure, the ice rink breaks as soon as u jump into the book abt 2 chapters in but the second plot point took too long to happen. i wish it would’ve happened sooner to let the book pick up quicker and become shorter. also i loathe aaron in this book. do i really need to talk abt him? i’m pretty sure everyone hates him.i personally would not forgive nathan for what he said at the end. that might just be me being petty but i don’t want to take shit from a man!! i’d deserve better than someone who can’t work out their feelings bc i got my own bullshit to deal with. sometimes i couldn’t see the reasoning behind the things the characters did bc of the way they justified it. sometimes justification works butnot in this case!TW WITHIN THIS BOOK: EATING DISORDERi want to address the eating disorder that is part of the plot within the book but i also don’t want to be insensitive just in case. i just want to say i’m glad it was addressed and talk about! i didn’t like how late they addressed it into the book thoone more thing: i’m convinced them “playing house” is another way of them boning and making it their entire personality for the entirety of a few hours. this book really pushed my limits. it also sounds like something roleplay relatedpre-reviewi had a nightmare i rated this book 5 stars. rtc'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'what in the insta-lovey-wattpad-pick-me-shit-every-trope-in-the-fucking-world did I just read?this review is longer than aaron’s dick yet smaller than his ego.dnf @ chapter 5update:i read wildfire. sometimes i wonder if my lack of brain cells will be my downfall'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Can we take a moment and talk about therealstar of the book?✨Henry✨He was the best character in this whole book, i was practically frothing at the mouth whenever he appeared, I swear if this man was real i would be on my knees.......to propose, get your minds out of the gutter.He literally so cute and rediculously funny, he says what he thinks in the moment and doesn\'t give a damn.For example Nate wanted to talk to Stassie and JJ said lets get some drink (to let them have some alone time) and Henry said why? you have a drink and so do iGod i love that man, and he got like maybe maximum of 20 pages of screen timeLets not forget :"" it was fun staying in Henry\'s room.

The Paradise Problem
",Christina Lauren,4.1,234563,202537,"Romance, Audiobook, Fiction, Contemporary, Contemporary Romance, Chick Lit, Adult",352,14-05-2024,"Christina Lauren, returns with a delicious new romance between the buttoned-up heir of a grocery chain and his free-spirited artist ex as they fake their relationship in order to receive a massive inheritance.Anna Green thought she was marrying Liam “West” Weston for access to subsidized family housing while at UCLA. She also thought she’d signed divorce papers when the graduation caps were tossed, and they both went on their merry ways.Three years later, Anna is a starving artist living paycheck to paycheck while West is a Stanford professor. He may be one of four heirs to the Weston Foods conglomerate, but he has little interest in working for the heartless corporation his family built from the ground up. He is interested, however, in his one-hundred-million-dollar inheritance. There’s just one catch.Due to an antiquated clause in his grandfather’s will, Liam won’t see a penny until he’s been happily married for five years. Just when Liam thinks he’s in the home stretch, pressure mounts from his family to see this mysterious spouse, and he has no choice but to turn to the one person he’s afraid to introduce to his one-percenter parents—his unpolished, not-so-ex-wife.But in the presence of his family, Liam’s fears quickly shift from whether the feisty, foul-mouthed, paint-splattered Anna can play the part to whether the toxic world of wealth will corrupt someone as pure of heart as his surprisingly grounded and loyal wife. Liam will have to ask himself if the price tag on his flimsy cover story is worth losing true love that sprouted from a lie.","[{'rating': 4, 'content': ""4.5 rounded down - SO good!!

Yes, Liam lowballs tf outta her at the start, but then he\'s really in his MacKenzie Scott bag. Anyways, I\'m a sucker for fake marriage to cash out an inheritance (yes, this specific scenario), so this quickly became one of my most anticipated reads of the year. Thankfully, it was one of the better reads from that list.(Not so) fun fact: this is the first Christina Lauren book I\'ve read with my eyeballs. I\'ve commented that their other books are always funny in the first half and stressy \'n depressy in the second, and this was a similar vibe. I would say it was the least annoying of the handful I\'ve read—the MMC didn\'t gaslight the FMC for not being chill about his cheating past (lol) and there were no simultaneous sex dreams (projectile vomit). Was Anna leaning heavily toward ""pick me"" territory? Tower of Pisa levels of lean, yes. But I did like their bants and how she loosened the stick that was so firmly wedged in Liam\'s poop chute.I hate to say it, but this was weirdly an escapist read (until all the conflict). Yes, billionaires are doing awful things, forcing us to use paper straws being one of their more vicious crimes, but I would never say no to an over-water bungalow. I\'m sorry. Also, I\'ve been described as financiallyilliterate, but Anna may have me beat. Not sure how 100k was going to pay off her student loans, her father\'s medical bills, and pay for daily rehab in the US.All in all, this was a fun, straightforward read. One of the better fake marriage romances I\'ve read and definitely the best billionaire romance. Finally found one where the MMC wasn\'t a straight-up misogynistic sociopath (ahem Terms & Conditions by Lauren Asher).pros & conspros: funny, good dynamic between Anna and Liam, loved the setting, did as good of a job one could do in making a billionaire romance palatable in this current climatecons: the ending was TOO neatly wrapped up, sometimes Anna gave strong pick-me vibes, that tie-dye dress Liam was salivating over was a crime... very 2007 prom of her, some math quite literally did not add up__Check out my YouTube'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3.5/4 stars - cute story.

I adore this dynamic duo, and their chemistry and quick-witted, passionate love stories never cease to amaze me.I was truly devastated and even cried aloud after my ARC request was rejected. This book is absolutely phenomenal! Every year, I vote for Emily Henry’s books as the best in romance, but this year, my favorite duo has outdone themselves. They’ve crafted a brilliant fake-real marriage of convenience and opposites-attract story, set against the stunning backdrop of an Indonesian island wedding. Imagine a family dynamic that’s a mix of the Lannisters from ""Game of Thrones"" and the Roys from ""Succession"" (minus the “Disgusting Brothers” team).The story is narrated by Anna Green, a 25-year-old, pink-haired, eccentric artist who resembles a human Muppet character. She’s a starving artist working odd jobs to pay her rent and her recovering cancer patient father’s hospital bills. Her counterpart, Liam “West” Weston, is the middle son and one of the heirs to the Weston Foods conglomerate. A quirky professor, he was raised by a narcissistic father and a brutally honest mother, making him one of four siblings in a dysfunctional family.During his doctoral studies, Liam refused to join the family business, opting instead for his own path. He was only approved for graduate housing if he had a family. Enter his brother Jack, who introduced him to Anna. She couldn\'t afford to rent an apartment, so they agreed to a temporary marriage to share the apartment. After two years, when Anna graduated and Liam completed his doctorate, they planned to part ways.Three years later, Anna is at her lowest, fired from her gas station night shift job, living with adventurous roommates, spending her days watching ""Conan the Barbarian,"" and experimenting with edibles. Suddenly, she’s greeted by a handsome stranger—her ex-husband, Liam. Except they never actually divorced. Liam is no longer a penniless student but an heir to the sixth-largest grocery empire, about to inherit a hundred million dollars. The catch? He must stay married for five years and introduce his wife to his family at his sister Charlotte’s wedding on a private Indonesian island.Anna initially resists the plan until Liam reveals a loophole in the will that could endanger his entire family. He offers her compensation that could pay off her student debt, cover her father’s medical bills, and fund her art career. She even has a ""Pretty Woman"" moment, receiving a credit card for a makeover and luxurious dresses for the ten-day wedding event.As they pretend to be a romantic couple, the sparks fly, and their chemistry becomes undeniable. The only problem is whether the good-hearted but straightforward, feisty, and artistic Anna can fit into the toxic world of pretentious rich people.Can Liam protect the woman he’s developing feelings for? Will he choose his family’s benefits over his love, risking his chance at forever happiness?This book is a masterful blend of high-tension family drama, a perfect paradise setting, intense chemistry, steamy scenes, and hilarious yet heartwarming moments. The characterization is brilliant! Ray Weston is a triple-threat villain reminiscent of Logan Roy, Tywin Lannister, and Blake Carrington. His wife, Janet, is a cold-blooded, snarky insult machine. Eldest brother Alex is a people-pleaser living in his father’s shadow, fueled by resentment and envy towards Liam. Younger brother Jack is the underachiever, and Charlotte is the baby of the family. They all need therapy to address their issues, reminding us that money doesn’t cure unhappiness or family traumas.I loved the perfect chemistry between Anna and Liam and the natural progression of their relationship. They’re truly meant to be! They’ve become one of my favorite book couples, and this book is not only my favorite Christina Lauren novel but also my favorite romance book of 2024, earning a well-deserved five stars!medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Anna Green.

Well, that's exactly what you'll get with Liam and Anna in this delightful read. From the get-go, these two are simply irresistible. Anna's sass and humor had me chuckling, while Liam’s journey from a guarded loner to someone who embraces his feelings was nothing short of heartwarming.Anna is the kind of character who lights up every page she’s on. Her wit and spark not only entertain but also bring out the best in those around her—especially Liam. Watching her influence on him was like seeing sunshine melt away the frost. Initially, Liam might not win you over immediately, but trust me, give him time. As he starts to let his guard down and allow his emotions to surface, you’ll see a transformation that’s both touching and satisfying.One of the standout features of this book is the dual perspective. It’s a brilliant move by the author, allowing us to dive deep into both characters’ minds. Through Liam’s eyes, we see the profound impact of his relationship with his father, adding a layer of depth to his character and enriching the story. His struggle and eventual triumph over his past are truly uplifting.And let’s talk about the balance in this book—oh, it’s spot on! There’s the perfect mix of spicy moments, laugh-out-loud humor, and heartfelt scenes that tug at your heartstrings. The author has woven these elements together seamlessly, creating a narrative that keeps you hooked from start to finish.Sure, the plot might not win awards for originality, but who needs that when the execution is this good? The layers within the story—character growth, emotional depth, and the evolving dynamics between Liam and Anna—make it a memorable journey.

It felt a bit rushed, but it doesn’t overshadow the overall enjoyment and satisfaction the ending brings.In conclusion, if you’re looking for a book with charming characters, a well-balanced story, and an emotional rollercoaster that leaves you smiling, this is the one.

Pretty crazy that they were together for as long as they were and nothing really developed.But I loved their relationship from the start. Anna is crazy but in such a good way and is so funny. Her personality really jived nicely with Liam\'s because although he is more private and less animated, he still has a great personality and really seemed to adore how quirky Anna was and never made her feel any less than appreciated.But his family man. His family is certifiable. They ended up being a bit of a negative for me because it was just SO CRAZY it was unreal. I think it could have been dialed down a notch and still been enjoyable and would have moved the story alone. But I was anxious throughout the whole book because they spent 90% of it with the family and there was always some bullshit happening.And we were SO CLOSE to getting through this without a third act breakup. I was getting so stoked as I was getting close to the end and realizing that they were just weathering the storm together and communicating like mad crazy and then it happened, and it was a little dumb.

I am sad I have never been able to enjoy another Christina Lauren book since Love and Other Words. They were a one hit wonder for me.Fake-dating will forever be my most hated trope, so I won't even bother giving this book a rating because it's obviously not fair (even though Emily Henry has successfully given me a fake dating book I can enjoy) but this one has all the things I absolutely despise.Childish plot, childish characters, insta-lust, and the worst of it all:the quirky intolerable and unknowingly hot female.oomg, what did you say? I am sorry I am soooo high off my weed gummies I couldn't hear you. Did I mention that I am high? Yes, I am so high, and I have pink hair and I sit on my couch and I play video games. Ugh, please stop staring at me, I know I have jelly beans on my boobs and blurred make up on my face from 3 nights ago because I haven't showered in daaaaaaaays but he still thinks I am stunning. But ugh, I am soooooo quirkkyyyyy and poor, and unaware of my hotness because I am just a little nerd who likes weed, and painting and resident evil ....Just shut the fuck up.

It had all the markings of a book I would usually love. And I enjoyed it for the most part, but we ended up with a Succession like family story and that's where this fell a little bit flat for me.I really loved the parts with Anna and West falling in love. But if you're going to dive in hard with toxic familial relationships I need a bit more closure on that in the end, more than what we got in this book. I liked this book, but felt pacing and story were a bit off. But Christina and Lauren always write a good time so I'm still glad I read this one. More glad I checked it out from my local library.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'they’ve never let me down,so here i go again ✨update:well, now i’m sure it’s me, i’m the problem, it is, indeed,me. not sure how i feel about it yet, i definitely excepted something.. better?'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3.5 ⭐️'}]"
